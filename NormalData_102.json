The first problem is that I was expecting Gnome to be updated to Gnome 3.  However, sysinfo reports:\nRelease: Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric)\nGnome:   2.32.1\nKernel:  3.0.0-12-generic\n\nI executed the unity_support_test to assure that Unity 3D is supported by my graphics hardware.

It looks identical to Ubuntu 2D (as identified on the session login screen), which I am guessing is the Unity 2D configuration.\nMy question is: Why is sysinfo reporting Gnome 2 rather than Gnome 3? \n\nA: a very very easy solution (even for Ubuntu-dulls or my mother in law...who is using also ubuntu) if Ubuntu is not upgrading properly, just download 11.10, burn it on a CD and install it!!! It will detect a previous failed installation and will correct it. All installed programs and most settings are keep as original. I was surprised how well it worked when I run into a problem while upgrading. My upgrade got stuck after rebooting at 'checking battery state' due to interruption of my wireless Internet while upgrading. Hope this helps for others as well!!!\n", "Q: Is there a ppa for gcc4.7?

This suggests that the problem is a dependency issue with the version loaded of the Equinox tools currently loaded into your version of Eclipse which are not compatible with the newer (updated) version of Eclipse.\nThis suggests that you may need to determine if the update to Eclipse requires a different version of Equinox, or if a reinstall of Equinox is required in order to update. You may wish to ask the Equinox community - not as familiar with this tool, but from what can be gathered, the version update will not resolve due to a dependency conflict which you can readily see. If Equinox can be removed and re-installed, that is probably the simplest method of updating.\nHTH. Have a nice day.

LightDM is the new login manager, and is meant to be themeable using HTML and CSS. How do I do that in Ubuntu 11.10? Can I use my own HTML file with my own text?\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've spent a little while googling about and found nothing very useful so far, apart from how to change the background image. \n\n*There is a launchpad answer referencing a theme directory but no clue as to what should go in the theme directory. It appears there used to be a /usr/share/lightdm/themes directory, but it is not on my system. \n\n*I've spent a while looking but haven't found the files the current theme is in - if I could find that I could try copying and adapt it - I've done dpkg -L of both the lightdm and unity-greeter packages but not seen any HTML or CSS files.\n\n*I have found the LightDM Reference Manual but that appears to be an API reference, not a configuration guide.\n\n*I have tried browsing the LightDM code but can't find any sample HTML/CSS files.\n\n\nEdit: To clarify I'd like to be able to edit an HTML file so I can add text to the login screen, not just change the fonts and background image.

It's linked to this javascript file which fakes lightdm for the web mockup. So maybe I can try putting a modified version of the HTML file in a directory and call that the theme directory ... But will have to try later - unless someone writes up some working instructions before then - hint, hint.\n\n\nA: Run this command gksu gedit /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf\nYou can edit any of the highlighted lines in the image.

It now switches between applications and leaves a tiny delay or keypress before letting you switch between windows within a certain application. I like this feature, but there is one thing bugging me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to disable the raising of all windows within the same\napplication and instead only raise the latest used?\n\n\nTo elaborate this more clearly: If I have 10 terminal windows open and want to switch between one of these terminals and Firefox with Alt+Tab, I end up having ten terminal windows cluttering my desktop whenever I switch back and forth. This makes it hard to read commands from Firefox while having the terminal open, since all other terminals are raised above Firefox' window.\n\nA: Yes, if you press the down arrow when you have selected the terminal in the alt+tab view, then you get previews for all terminals and can choose one. Then only that terminal is raised. The intention is to raise only the last used window when you use alt+tab, and raising all of those terminals is a confirmed bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/873082\nFor now, you might be interested to know that Unity 2D does not suffer from this bug, so perhaps you can switch to it for a while. While I'm at it, I'll also mention that you can now also use alt+the button above tab to switch between windows of the same type only. \n", "Q: Install package with apt-get and remove with aptitude?

It was one of most useful applications in Ubuntu in my opinion.\n\nA: You can read a short description about the reasons in the Ubuntu Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter#Rationale\nQuote:\n\nEarly versions of Ubuntu shipped many graphical utilities for\n  installing and removing software: Add/Remove Applications, Synaptic\n  Package Manager, Update Manager, Software Sources, apturl, GDebi, and\n  Computer Janitor. This redundancy increased the amount of interface\n  people had to learn, wasted space on the Ubuntu CD, fragmented\n  development effort, and made people more likely to think that\n  unsanctioned software installation methods were safe. Ubuntu Software\n  Center replaces Add/Remove Applications, Synaptic, apturl, and GDebi,\n  and acts as the main entry point to Software Sources.\nBeyond providing a central point for installing and removing software,\n  USC plays a small but important part in encouraging application\n  development on Ubuntu, by providing application developers with a\n  prominent way to offer their software for installation.\n\n\nA: Synaptic was removed from the base install because it was made redundant by Ubuntu Software Center. If Ubuntu Software Center doesn't fit your needs, it's very simple to restore Synaptic by using a single command: apt-get install synaptic.\n\nA: For 2 main reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software Center was going to replace it. That is why you see Software Center with a huge change and look.\n\n*Synaptic and its dependencies use several megabytes of space that could be used for something else. The idea was to keep it tight in the CD format space.\nThis is not problem since you can always install it. In my case I also use aptitude so doing something like this will give you aptitude and synaptic:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic aptitude\nOf course I udnerstand why you would want Synaptic. Personally I like the idea that if I type \"nvidia\" for example it shows me ALL packages related to it. Or if I want to install something from an not authenticated place it lets me. Software Center is safer in this matter since it does 2 things, removes from the search the packages that a user normally would not be searching for and does not let you install packages from a not authenticated place (It even tells you of it). Same goes for Update Manager.\nBut hey if you are 100% confident of the PPA then use Synaptic for it or if you want to find something specific that only 1 out of 2 million would search in the packages, then synaptic/aptitude/apt-get is for you.\n", "Q: \"skype: symbol lookup error: skype: undefined symbol\" Upgraded to 11.10 and Skype is no longer working.  I get the following error:\nskype: symbol lookup error: skype: undefined symbol: _ZN5QFile3mapExxNS_14MemoryMapFlagsE\n\nTried both downloading from Skype and from the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: I've had the same problem and I resolved as I explained in this link:\nUbuntu 11.10 + Skype = symbol lookup error\n\nIn my case some libQt were found in the wrong version in /usr/lib32\n  instead of /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu.\nI suppose the reason is some very old skype installation that requires\n  forcing the installation of some 32bit libraries To verify that it\n  also apply to you, do the following in the terminal\nldd /usr/bin/skype | grep Qt\n\nlibQtDBus.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtDBus.so.4 (0xf7569000)\nlibQtGui.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4 (0xf6aa3000)\nlibQtNetwork.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtNetwork.so.4 (0xf6967000)\nlibQtCore.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtCore.so.4 (0xf66c5000)\nlibQtXml.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtXml.so.4 (0xf626d000)\n\nVerify that all qt libraries are found in\n  /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ and not in /usr/lib32.   If you found\n  some libraries in /usr/lib32 I suggest you to backup them and remove\n  them from /usr/lib32 and verify that the results of\n ldd /usr/bin/skype | grep Qt  \n\nnow find them in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/\n\nBriefly, the problem was that skype found some stale and old libQt* libraries in /usr/lib32 insted of those installed with i386 version of libQt.\nThose old libraries were probably installed for old skypes to work\n\nA: That solved the problem for me too. I am running Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit and installed the Skype deb package for 64-bit. When querying the Qt libraries used by Skype, I noticed some 3 libraries where used from a Google Earth installation in /opt/google/earth:\n$ ldd /usr/bin/skype | grep Qt\n    libQtDBus.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtDBus.so.4 (0xf7564000)\n    libQtGui.so.4 => /opt/google/earth/free/libQtGui.so.4 (0xf6af9000)\n    libQtNetwork.so.4 => /opt/google/earth/free/libQtNetwork.so.4 (0xf69cd000)\n    libQtCore.so.4 => /opt/google/earth/free/libQtCore.so.4 (0xf66d2000)\n    libQtXml.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtXml.so.4 (0xf627a000)\n\nRunning from the command line\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ /usr/bin/skype\n\nforced use of the libraries in the i-386-linux-gnu directory and successfuly launched Skype.\nIn order to have the Unity / Dash launcher working I modified the Exec line accordingly.  This spare the use of a terminal to launch the application.\nEdit the Skype launcher in /usr/share/applications in a gedit window launched from the command line $ gksu gedit [superuser mode]\nThen replace\nExec=skype\n\nby \nExec=env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ /usr/bin/skype\n\nThis way Skype can be launched from the Unity / Dash in Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: on the http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/  choose \"Dynamic\" as your distribution this should give you a file similar to \"skype-4.2.0.13.tar.bz2\". Use the following commands to extract and start skype:\ntar -xvf skype-4.2.0.13.tar.bz2\nmv skype-4.2.0.13 skype\n./skype/skype &\n\n\nA: This is not a complete answer, but at least a workaround:\nRun skype from the commandline, manually making sure it is pointed to the i386 libraries:\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ /usr/bin/skype\n\nThis is assuming you have the skype:i386 package installed (it sounds like you do).\nThe real solution still eludes me, but may be different depending on the machine...\nThe problem has to do with the current transition to multiarch (which allows libraries of different architectures on the same install - such as i386 and amd64.)\nThe skype installed from Ubuntu Software Centre is skype:i386 and needs to link against i386 versions of libaries. What I suspect is that somewhere along the line it loads an amd64 library instead of the i386 version.  (Perhaps a broken install left over from an old package, or badly-packaged 3rd party product?)\nIwan\n\nA: I fixed the skype launch and audio issue on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS the following way:\nTo run Skype from Terminal: Point it to the i386 libraries like shown below\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=30 /usr/bin/skype\nTo Launch the Skype from Dash: Edit the file '/usr/share/applications/skype.desktop'\nsudo YOUR_FAVORITE_EDITOR_HERE /usr/share/applications/skype.desktop\nChange this line\nExec=env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 skype %U\nto\nExec=env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=30 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ skype %U\nNote: I changed the pulse latency to 30 from 60 to make the audio work and added the LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nThis was reported to still work with Ubuntu 14.04.\nSource : Unable to launch Skype in Ubuntu 64bit - Symbol Lookup Error \n", "Q: Compiz crash leaves no usable interface \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears \n\n\nI've reinstalled Ubuntu probably over 15 times now because of this and another problem(I'll talk about this later). I'm new to Ubuntu and a week ago I just wanted to try the OS out. I installed it as a dual-boot alongside Windows 7. When I started it up for the first time I was enticed to play with it. I install my video card drivers and then fine that I can install a newer version. (I have an ATI Radeon HD 4670) I research and find tutorials on how to do all the things.\nSometimes when I'm doing certain things, like apt-get update or downloading new stuff with either software center or Synaptic, the unity interface just disappears, this includes the system tray at the top. So I can't do anything but restart. I press restart and it takes me to the login screen. Then from there I have to press restart again to finally restart. When Ubuntu starts up again, I log in and the boot sound plays. Then the system tray is back, but not fully, like what you can see from the screenshot.\nNow I've said that this has happened many times and I've reinstalled Ubuntu all this time. But the most recent occurrence happened just a little while before I'm typing this. I'm tired of having to reinstall over and over again. Sometimes I even set up everything all well and have my programs and it happens. What just happened is I was installing Restricted Codecs stuff on Synaptic. I waited patiently for the files to download (slow because I'm from Malaysia but the Malaysia server doesn't have all files and I have to use Main Server). Finally it says it's installing the files, so I continue browsing on Mozilla while waiting for it to be done. Then a window pops up asking me whether I agree to the terms to install something; can't remember which. The moment I clicked on the agree box, I got kicked out of the system and back into the login screen. I login and say \"Not again!\" Sometimes going to certain settings in Compiz also causes this..\nThe other problem I speak of is starting in an unsupported monitor mode. I know this is because of faulty driver installation so I won't ask about this.\nSo please, any help is appreciated! I really like Ubuntu but I can't keep installing it like this over and over again!.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Looks like the Compiz Unity plugin is accidentally deselected. Press  Ctrl + Alt +  T and type unity --replace and you would have your Unity back. Alternatively, if you have CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) installed in your computer, you can type ccsm in Terminal and run the program. There, under the desktop heading, you can select 'Ubuntu Unity plugin' and your Unity would be back to normal.\n", "Q: Why does logging in to Unity session take so long? When I'm logging in to Unity in 11.10 it takes about 15-20 seconds for the Desktop to be ready. When I compare that to the loading times of 10.04 where it's almost instant there is a huge discrapancy in log in times. Is gnome3/Unity really that massive to not be loaded faster?\nPlease no unnecessary comments about: \n\n\n*\n\n*autostart applications as I set none (at least not by autostart option via cog).\n\n*bootup-manager as I reduced the processes there to a minimum\n\nA: 15-20 seconds sounds about right, i got that sort of time when i was using 11.10, since i upgraded to 12.04 (being released tomorrow as of this writing), my login times and boot times have been cut down by about 60%.\nIn answer to your question, 15-20 seconds is not unusual at all for your hardware, my hardware is comparable to yours but with better graphics.\n", "Q: How do I switch between Unity and Unity 2D without logging out? I really like  both Unity and Unity 2D. They currently have different issues, meaning that one does not have the issue the other has. For instance, when I play Battle for Wesnoth, then it integrates nicely with the global menu on Unity 2D, but not so well on Unity. So I tend to switch to Unity 2D while playing it, since I can then use my other monitor without switching between windowed and fullscreen mode. There are other cases as well. \nHowever, for me, that currently means logging out and back in. I know that this isn't necessary, so I was wondering exactly what to do to switch between them in-place, without logging out. \n\nA: I use a script to switch between Metacity and Unity and another to reload unity when I need to.\nA probable solution would involve:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#stop Compiz and thus Unity.\n\nkillall compiz &\n\n#make sure to kill any conflicting processes (just in case, but this is optional).\n\nkillall metacity &\n\n#This does not always exit cleanly, so kill it with fire for surety that it is dead.\nkillall unity-panel-service &\n\n#load Unity 2D.\n\nmetacity --replace&\nunity-2d-shell &\nunity-2d-panel &\ndisown\n\n^-- to load Unity 2D, and:\n#!/bin/sh\nkillall unity-2d-panel &\nkillall unity-2d-shell &\nkillall unity-2d-spread &\nkillall metacity &\nunity &\ndisown\n\n^-- to load Unity 3D\nYou could save them as scripts in your ~/bin folder, for example as unity2dloader and unity3dloader respectively, and then simply run them from the run dialogue (alt+f2).\nYou could also place them in your nautilus scripts folder, and run them from the Desktop by right clicking on the Desktop, choosing the scripts menu and then the appropriate script.\n", "Q: Why are overlay scrollbars in Eclipse enabled on 64bit but disabled on 32bit? I was using a 64bit Ubuntu but decided to switch to 32bit. Now, my Eclipse does not display overlay scrollbars anymore, but instead uses the old scrollbars. So why are they disabled on Ubuntu 11.10 32bit?\n\nA: Overlay scrollbars were blacklisted because a workaround for a number of other bugs was causing them to glitch in Eclipse. These bugs have since been resolved (as far as I can tell).\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eclipse/+bug/769277\nAlthough it would seem only on the 32-bit arch ; I've never noticed them being blacklisted on 64-bit.\nTry editing /usr/bin/eclipse and removing the GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS variable, and further adding\nexport LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=1\nPrecise lists the newer Eclipse 3.7.1 release and includes removal of the GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS variable, so hopefully they have also removed it from the blacklist.\n", "Q: how to remove dependencies of webmin post apt-get --purge remove I removed webmin, as I no longer needed it.\nBut I removed it with apt-get --purge remove,\nthinking it would remove dependencies and simply retrace back what it did during installation.

You need to realise this when comparing number from Disk Usage Analyser and GParted, as they use different units. df uses the units G, M and K to mean GiB, MiB and KiB respectively. If you want to use multiple of ten units, pass --si to df.\nNow on to your questions.\n\n\nMy home folder /home/jiewmeng is said to use 58.8GB? but the biggest few files, don't appear to sum up to that? Counting quickly, it looks like ~1.5GB only?\n\nThe output of Disk Usage Analyser only shows  directories. If your home directory is full of very large files, that will be included in the usage number of the home directory, but those large files won't get separate rows in the displayed table. This is probably what is happening in your case.\n\n\nLooking at the 2nd image, my HDD doesn't seem to be all that full at all? Is it a mistake? \n\nYou have three partitions on your hard drive (not counting the swap partition), as shown by GParted. Your home directory is included in the partition /dev/sda1 mounted at /, since it isn't in its own partition. /dev/sda1 only has 3.45 GiB free space. Some of this free space (5%) is reserved for the root user by default. If you subtract that, you get what is known as the \"available space\", which is 4KiB according to the output of df. To double-check, run System Monitor and open the File Systems tab, you'll be able to compare the free space and the available space of each partition at once.\nSo, yes, the first partition is very full.\n\nIf I were you, I would boot a live CD of Ubuntu, make a backup of my data, shrink the /dev/sda2 partition, and grow the /dev/sda1 partition using GParted.\n\nA: Chances are if the first few files don't add up, the disk analyzer is missing something, the filesystem is corrupt, or you have several hundred thousand 10mb files in there somewhere.\ntry:\n- running fdisk\n\n\n*\n\n*looking manually into the folder with high usage and checking how many files there are.\n\n*using a different usage analyzer that could show the hidden files or those with a bad entry in directory listings(try Jdiskreport)\n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu Software Center to the latest version I want to update my Ubuntu Software Center to the latest version.

Have a look.\nBasic recommendation is stay away from optimus, nvidia does not give driver support for linux on those yet!\nThe only methods known to do anything in your graphics is to disable the nvidia card with acpi calls, saves battery but that wont do any good on turning your unity3d on, you will be running with your default Intel card, which is also a very bad thing.\n\nA: I have a dell xps and i had this problem: \nThe \"optimus\" technology that is used to switch between the nvidia graphics card and the integrated graphics is not supported by the nvidia drivers given. So you cannot run 3d-graphics. Because it will always use the integrated graphics instead of the nvidia graphics. This is a frustrating problem because the card keeps consuming power while not doing anything. \nI haven't found a solution yet. \nI don't know if this is the same problem you are having but it might be. \n\nA: Graphics cards seem to have become a large issue with the 11.10 release. nVidia has been especially plagued with its fair share.

I am so used to it that ubuntu is unusable now without it, after the 11.10 upgrade. I cannot get it to work no matter how hard I Try.\nHow do I go about getting them back? Why did Ubuntu stop hot corners? It was so amazingly useful! \nI've only used ubuntu for basic tasks because it was a nightmare getting my wacom table to work on it. So please give the complete details necessary, \nthanks.\n\nA: More than likely you used Compiz Config Settings Manager to set up your hot corners. There are other applications, but since you seem to be using Unity I won't go into all of that.\nIn general, setting up a hot corner is dependent on the particular plugin/feature that you want to activate (in other words you have to choose the hot corner from the plugin's settings).\nAn example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Compiz Config Settings Manager.\n\n*Open the Widget Layer Plugin's settings.\n\n\n*Click on the \"none\" next to Toggle Widget Display.\n\n\n*Choose a hot corner (screen edge), and close the dialogue.\n\n*Try your new hot corner, and change it if you like.\n\n\nNB:\nThe same method works for other plugins that support hot corners, including showing the desktop (in general options), activating scale mode (globabally), etc.\n\nA: A lot of useful stuff can be set in the Compiz Config Settings Manager (ccsm). This can be installed by searching for \"Compiz\" in the Software Center. On the details page of compiz there's a checkbox to install the settings manager. If you aren't afraid of the command line, you can also install it far more easily by typing\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nin the terminal. Since there's no longer a link to ccsm in the sytem settings, start it manually by pressing ALT+F2 and typing ccsm [Enter]. Within this settings manager, under \"common settings\" (I think it's called like that, I run the german translation, there it's \"Allgemeine Optionen\") there's a tab called \"key bindings\". On this tab is a small screen icon next to \"Show desktop\". That's where you can assign a hot corner or border for \"show desktop\". To get an overview over all desktops, you use compiz' \"Expo\" Plugin. In its settings (also accessible in compiz config settings manager) you can set an \"Expo edge\". The overview over all windows is configured via the \"scale windows\" plugin of compiz, just the same way. \n\nA: You have to install compiz config and then setup your hot corners. I recorded a video to help you out: http://madmed88.tumblr.com/post/12787461772/setup-hot-corners-in-ubuntu-compiz-unity\n", "Q: Where can I find libnotify1_0.5.0-2ubuntu1_i386.deb? I have installed Ubuntu 11.10.  I am trying to install Thunderbird 8.0 and it keeps saying that it is dependent on libnotify1 (>=0.5.0).  \nI find that libnotify1 is not installed in 11.10.  It is not listed in Ubuntu web sites as a download for 11.10. It does list it for 11.04. \nDoes anyone know can libnotify1_0.5.0-2ubuntu1_i386.deb be install in 11.10?  If not, how do I overcome the Thunderbird dependency issue?  Thanks for any help.\n\nA: If I were you, I'd wait for official ubuntu packages of thunderbird 8, it shouldn't take too long until those show up in the update-manager. \nAnyhow, if you really can't wait, you can install libnotify 0.7 manually from the official repositories. Just\nsudo apt-get install libnotify-bin\n\nIf you're running 64bit Ubuntu and want the 32bit Thunderbird, you probably need the 32bit version of the library, which you can install by\nsudo apt-get install libnotify-bin:i386\n\n\nA: your thunderbird is not compatible with 11.10. 11.10 has libnotify4 (updated) default installed.

I've tried out Fedora 15, which actually worked for my computer -- nice 3d graphics, recognised my intel card and used the driver.  I'm trying to install the intel graphics on a 11.04 alienware M11x.  First step I figured would be disabling nvidia, but using sudo echo \"blacklist nouveau\" > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia.conf says permission is denied (Yes, I definitely used sudo).

You had 3D issues because the card could not be used, but the drivers were still loaded, preventing the Mesa OpenGL module from being loaded. This breaks graphical effects, 3D capabilities and such. Uninstalling the nvidia driver reverts this behavior.\nYour sudo echo command failed because of Redirect the output using `sudo`\nOptimus is not supported by nVidia for Linux.

It then stops working and nothing happens with two finger scrolling until I manually find a point on the screen that isn't the flash. How do I get this working?\n\nA: The underlying problem is that the scroll events are being captured by the Flash object, but are not being passed onto the parent window when the Flash application has no use for them.\nI'm not sure whether the responsibility lies with Adobe or the individual authors of the Flash applications concerned, but alas, I don't think there is anything that Ubuntu can do to fix this.\n", "Q: What is different on the server versions of 11.10 and 10.04?

However you'll be able to upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 directly, because 12.04 is also a LTS. \nGenerally you'll get newer versions of packages.

The wireless password needs to be secure so students can't connect their personal devices onto the network. The problem we are facing right now is that the network manager lets you view the saved wireless passwords in plain text.  I changed the permissions of the network config editor so students can connect to any other networks or even pull up the editor to view the password. So that fixed the problem.. So I thought.. I just realized that if the laptop can not connect to the network then it pops up an authentication needed error box and with the show password check box available again.. So students can figure out the wireless password.  Does anyone know where I can turn off that checkbox option?  Would it be under gconf-editor to a specific file?\nRight now I have no work around so the laptops are sitting in my office and won't be able to be used until I have a solution.\nCurrent config - ubuntu 10.04 \ncurrently have /home/username/.gconf/apps/nm-applet set to chmod 000 along with /usr/bin/nm-connection-editor set to 000 also. This is how I blocked access the password but when that box auto pops up because it can't connect and gives them the password on a silver platter its kind of hard to allow the students to use them.. BTW I am not the network admin so I can't just change that it only accepts wireless by mac address.. we have over 5000 machines on the network and roughly half have wireless so they aren't going to switch over any time soon.\n\nA: Setup the wireless network as an admin, and check the box to make the connection \"Available to all users\" at the bottom of the dialog when you edit the wireless network. \nOk, so let me be more verbose and explicit: \n\n\n*\n\n*Log in as an administrator. This account is not accessible by students. \n\n*Click the network icon and select \"Edit connections\". \n\n*In the Wireless tab, select your network and click edit. \n\n*In the bottom of that window, click \"Available to all users\". \n\n\nNow, the connection will be configured automatically at boot, other users are able to use the network, but if they try to edit that network, they'll be asked to input your password. Failing to do that, means not being able to edit that connection, hence not being able to see the password. \nIf indeed, like you say, students can see the password when the connection fails, then that is a bug to be fixed, and not worked around. It's quite obvious that users should not be able to read other peoples personal information. \n\nA: The only thing that I can think of off the top of my head is to not use network manager, but setup the connection manually.\n\nSetup a shell script that sets up wireless network using iwconfig -\n  have it setup with global execute permission but rw only to root.\n\nI would also consider adding this as a feature request to the Gnome folks.\n", "Q: Where to configure shortcut keys of Nautilus? I would like to configure and change some shortcut keys of Nautilus (file manager of Ubuntu). Does anyone know where I could do that?\nEdit1: Precisely, initial binding for \"go to parent folder\" in Nautilus is Tab + Up arrow, I would like to chang it to Ctrl + Up arrow because Tab + Up arrow has already been set to other things via Compiz.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 13.04  through 16.04 at least, the keyboard shortcuts for Nautilus are mapped in the \"~/.config/nautilus/accels\" file.  Edit that file to change the mappings.\n\nA: This Nautilus extension allows you to edit keyboard shortcuts (accelerators).\nAfter installing the extensions go to Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts... in the main menu and search for the Up action in the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog. Click the Key cell corresponding to this action and enter a shortcut:\n\nUnlike the can_change_accels solution this will also work with Unity's global menus.\n\nA: I assume, you mean the keys for something that can be found in nautilus' menu bar.\nFirst: This doesn't work if the global menu is on. Since you can't disable it for nautilus on a per-window basis (for nautilus is always running in the background), you should either log in to a non-unity-session (like gnome shell) or disable it for all windows. (Here is a guide how to disable it). You have to change a setting in gconf-editor (which might not yet be installed on your system, but can be found in software center). The key you need to enable is: \n/desktop/gnome/interface/can_change_accels\n\nProbably you need to log off and back on again to make this change take effect. Afterwards just point at the menu entry whose schortcut you want to change and press the desired keys. After all changes are done, you can turn on global menu again.\n", "Q: Why does the file lens not search mounted samba shares?

I really like the unity launcher, but in Awesome it only displays on Tag 1, and sometimes pops up behind other windows.

Look in your rc.lua file (which should be in ~/.config/awesome/) for the section that starts with: \n-- {{{ Rules\nawful.rules.rules = {\n\nand then add the following awful rule\n{ rule = { class = \"Unity-2d-launcher\" },\nproperties = { sticky = true } },\n\nFor example, you can add that rule right before the last line of the section which is -- }}}.

Anyone know how to get it working?\n\nA: Submitted a bug report.\n\nA: It probably looks strange that I reply to such an old posting, but I also stumbled across this one when I looked for a solution how to integrate emacs into the Unity appmenu (global and locally integrated into window bar). So I dare to reply. Here are my two cents:\nemacs 24 potentially integrates well with Unity, but it seems it is blacklisted by in a hardcoded way. There is a very simply way around this: to simple include it into the whitelist:\n\n\n*\n\n*open dconf editor (search \"dconf\" in the Unity dash)\n\n*go to \"com | canonical | unity-gtk-module\"\n\n*add emacs24 to whitelist, e.g. ['emacs24']\n\n\nThis is it, at least for me it works perfectly (I am using Ubuntu 14.04 with the MacBuntu theme and locally integrated menus).\n\nA: On Ubuntu 14.04, the following command does the job,\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-gtk-module whitelist \"['emacs24']\"\n\n", "Q: How to enable Empathy chat room notifications?

I'm experiencing an issue when using the \"Safely Remove\" option to remove my 1TB external HDD from the Unity Launcher. Not every time, but occasionally my screen will go black and display LARGE amounts of text information (which I obviously cannot screen cap).  The jist of the info displayed is that unmounting or 'safely removing' the drive causes a kernel panic.  Is there a Command Line command to remove mounted drives, or at least one that would show me some sort of error output when the drive is removed?  I'm trying to narrow down the cause.  I could be imagining this, but it seems to happen most often when I have other programs running when I remove the drive (i.e. Firefox, Transmission).  Please note that my external drive is not in use when I attempt to remove it and it is not being used either by Firefox or Transmission at these times.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Hopefully I'm posting this in the right spot, but I wanted t to thank everyone for their answers and say that I was able to solve this issue by installing ejecter from the repositories.  \nI turned off mounted drives in the Unity settings and now use ejecter to remove the external HDD.  All seems well now and I just thought I'd share this workaround with anyone else who might have a similar issue.\n\nA: Very unlikely.\nNo matter how you unmount your drive, in the end the kernel will be responsible for the actual hardware; since it panics from the user interface, it will most likely panic from the command line, too.\nYour very best option would be to follow the instructions at How can I get a Kernel Core Dump and post the core dump to the ubuntu kernel maintainers.\nYour second best option would be to try to \"single step\" the unmount process from a root terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flush: sync\n\n*Remount read-only: mount -o remount,ro /media/someDrive\n\n*Unmount.\n\n\nThen see at which step it crashes and retry the same without step 1 but with a manual read-only mount.\nThe most trivial thing to do is however confirm if your TB Drive is in need of a fsck. Note that if it is NTFS-formatted from Windows, the linux fsck can only flag it for check under windows because the real check can't be implemented in free software due to some proprietary reasons.\nOn a side note, generally external drives don't get mounted with FUSE; if there is a  driver available, you could mount it with FUSE and only the user mode filesystem would crash leaving the remainder of the system alive but I cannot guarantee anything in that direction.\n\nA: sudo umount /media/<> works for me. (I had the same problem in Linux Mint 12.)\n", "Q: Why shouldn't you enable laptop-mode when on AC power? I'm looking at ways to reduce the amount of power used by my laptop, and one of the things I came across was enabling laptop-mode. Apparently this is enabled when I'm not on AC power, but I'd like to save power when running on AC as well. Is there a reason why this isn't default?\n\nA: I assume you are asking about the special laptop-mode in the kernel, that spins down the hard drive when not used, and writes down data in \"bursts\".\nI can see three reasons:\n1) There apparently are issues with Ubuntu and laptop-mode. Computer hangs, and thus it is disabled by default.\n2) From the laptop-mode's FAQ we can read that desktop hard drives aren't that reliable for spin downs-ups as laptop hard drives.\n3) This is a power saving feature, and nothing else. In chance of a computer crash, you will lose all data not written down to the hard disk. And since the hard disk is suspended for periods of time, you will lose more data with this enabled than if disabled.\n", "Q: How to change Gnome Shell calendar default application? In Gnome shell calendar menu, when I click on \"Open Calendar\" it tries to open Evolution - even if it's not installed - Is it possible to change the default calendar?\n\n\nP.S.

Nothing but trouble? I downloaded 11.10 a couple days ago-- so far I love it, but I'm having issues with a graphics driver for the 6770 HD Radeon card.\nFirstly, if I try the two drivers from the driver program, one of them installs fine and one of them doesn't (the post-release one doesn't work at all, it fails during the DL and install). The one that does work decreases my performance-- just moving around windows causes minor lag.\nSo after some searching, I discovered this thread: How to install ATI Radeon 6770 drivers on 10.04? , and I followed the directions on it. Drivers install all fine and dandy (and I did de-activate the other driver before installing), but after a reboot (which the driver install requested), my desktop is all screwy. No launchpad, nothing but a desktop and a stripped-down top bar with what I think is the file/edit/view menu from Ubuntu's explorer program (don't know the name).\nI'd post screenshots for you, but I could neither access a program to do so, nor open firefox to upload them when it happens.\nAlso, both drivers, the one straight from AMD, and the one from the driver program caused issues with my dual monitors. I had no luck using Catalyst to change any settings either.\n\nA: Your card is listed as supported here: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Hardware\nRemove the open source drivers and try Catalyst\nSee http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Installation_Guide\n", "Q: How can I see net traffic in the apps bar?

The idea is as follows:\nfdisk -l $IMAGE\n# calculate the offset in bytes\nmount -o loop,offset=$OFFSET $IMAGE $MOUNTPOINT\n\nThe method is best because it doesn't require deleting the loop device after you umount the mounted partition.\nTo further simplify the task (which is needed if you do it often), you may use my script mountimg to do everything for you. Just get it from https://github.com/AlexanderAmelkin/mountimg\nand use like this:\nmountimg /media/external_media/sda.img 2 /media/sda_image\n\nYou may as well specify filesystem type and any other additional mount options if you like:\nmountimg /media/external_media/sda.img 2 /media/sda_image -t vfat -o codepage=866,iocharset=utf-8\n\nWhen you're done with the partition, simply umount it:\numount /media/sda_image\n\n\nA: Edit : works with util-linux >=2.21.

From the output you can see the sizes of the partitions which helps you identify them. You can mount the one you want with:\n$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p2 /mnt\n\nAlternatively, the block device is detected by Nautilus and you can mount it from the side bar:\n\nWhen you are done, unmount what you mounted and remove the device mapping:\n$ sudo umount /mnt\n$ sudo kpartx -d disk_image.raw\n\n\nA: Try gnome-disk-image-mounter:\ngnome-disk-image-mounter sda.img\n\nNo sudo required.

If it's wrong, perhaps the previous question can be re-opened, and this answer put there, where I'd like it to be? Since this user edited the original question, I suspect he might have been the one to close the original: https://askubuntu.com/users/301745/wjandrea\nAnyway, leaving the filing issues behind, here's an example of trying to mount the ISO:\n$ sudo mount -o ro,loop -t iso9660 nero.iso /mnt\nmount: /mnt: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.\n\nI called the ISO nero.iso because using the file command revealed the ISO is an artifact of the \"Nero\" CD Burning software, not that that helps any:\n$ sudo file nero.iso\nnero.iso: Nero CD image at 0x4B000 UDF filesystem data (version 1.5) 'nero'\n\nAfter trying a few different things I came across a reference to the software iat which says it \"converts many CD-ROM image formats to iso9660\".

Now i could also set C_LIBRARY_PATH - actually it doesn't work - but I feel like I'm fighting the system here. Also, even if it succeeds, my newly built compiler would also not know about the i386-linux-gnu stuff. So I would have to set C_LIBRARY_PATH and C_INCLUDE_PATH before every build of every project I have. I could add it to my .bashrc but that subverts the system even more.\nSo, how do I tell the build process:\n\n\n*\n\n*That there are additional include/lib directories, and\n\n*That it should build a gcc which respects them too?\n\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to include the command which causes the above error message.

Lots of people have asked the same question but all the advice I've found for fixing this doesn't seem to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Settings > Appearance, there are four themes (Ambiance, Radiance, HighContrast, HighContrastInverse), all of which have exactly the same size resize border.\n\n*Installing other packages (e.g. human-theme) has no effect on the theme selection.\n\n*My laptop doesn't have a middle mouse button, and even if it did, I don't want to use two hands to press Alt + middle button just to resize a window.

Any changes I make to the Initiate Window Resize binding in the Resize window plugin have no effect.

Any ideas of how that might be done? I've tried several approaches, even a manual installation of the NVidia installer in a chrooted filesystem, but no success so far. \n\nA: Create a Live USB instead of a Live CD.  Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator application will let you do this, and it allows you to save data as well as a persistent storage medium.  You will need to load the ISO onto the USB and run it, install the NVidia drivers and you can then reuse it.  It effectively becomes a portalable Ubuntu.  \nHere are some instructions on the Ubuntu Help website:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\n", "Q: ssh no longer allows public key authentication My machine recently stopped accepting incoming public key authentication.  I have an ubuntu 11.04 desktop that I ssh into from a windows machine.  I use putty with pageant.  I am able to connect but only with interactive password authentication, not with my rsa key that I have setup.\nI have already verified that the key is listed in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.  How do I fix this and what do I check?\n\nA: If you check the permissions on the directories, and there is a \".\" right after them, then you may have selinux enabled, which will mess w/ the key exchange, and default to manual password identification. \nYou can disable SELinux to troubleshoot by following the instructions here: http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.1/Deployment_Guide/sec-sel-enable-disable-enforcement.html, or just edit the /etc/selinux/config file and change it from \"enforcing\" to \"disabled\". \nHope this helps.\n\nA: I would ensure that you have your settings in /etc/ssh/sshd_config correct.\nTo force the use of PKI only and to disallow passwords find the line \n#PasswordAuthentication yes \n\nin your file, uncomment it and set it to \nPasswordAuthenticate no\n\nI would also read through the balance of the settings to ensure they make sense. In particular, try to ensure that you use RSA keys since DSA is know to be compromised.\n\nA: If public key authentication doesn't work: make sure that on the server side, your home directory (~), the ~/.ssh directory, and the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, are all writable only by their owner. In particular, none of them must be writable by the group (even if the user is alone in the group). chmod 755 or chmod 700 is ok, chmod 770 is not.\nWhat to check when something is wrong:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run ssh -vvv to see a lot of debugging output. If you post a question asking why you can't connect with ssh, include this output (you may want to anonymize host and user names).\n\n*If you can, check the server logs in /var/log/auth.log.\n\n*If public key authentication isn't working, check the permissions again, especially the group bit (see above).\n\n\nA: One possible cause of the problem is that you have DSA keys but now SSH (apparently) defaults to requiring RSA keys.  I got the problem when upgrading to 16.04.  You can see more here but the short answer is add the following to ~/.ssh/config:\nPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-dss\n\n\nA: I ran into the same thing and finally figured out that it was because I encrypted my home directory. SSH can't read the authorized_keys file until you log in, so basically it forces you to password authenticate first. See the section about the encrypted home directory on the following link:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys#Encrypted_Home_Directory\n\nA: I fixed this problem by un-commenting \"PasswordAuthentication yes\" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. \n\nA: Due to a need for troubleshooting communication between two different machines, I had two private keys in ~/.ssh on the client side.\nInstead of configuring each server host with the respective private key in ~/.ssh/identity as I should have done, I had the secondary (and in this case wrong) key configured for all hosts:\nHost *\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/identity_b\n\nCorrecting ~/.ssh/identity resolved the issue:\nHost a\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/identity_a\nHost b\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/identity_b\n\n\nA: I just had the same problem but changing the permissions with chmod wasn't helping, since it turned out I didn't have ownership of the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. You can change ownership of the .ssh directory with:\nsudo chown -R \"$USER\" ~/.ssh\n\n\nA: Somehow this worked for me:\nroot@kaiser:~# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nChange this line from yes to no\n 28 StrictModes no\nTry again\nsysadmin@suselinux1:~> con sysadmin kaiser\nWelcome to Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-25-generic i686)\n\n\n*\n\n*Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/\nLast login: Fri Nov  9 15:40:11 2012 from 10.1.3.25\nsysadmin@kaiser:~$ date\nvie nov  9 17:53:11 CST 2012\nsysadmin@kaiser:~$ \n", "Q: Can't complete dropbox installation from behind proxy Problem:\nMy PC on campus sits behind a proxy (requiring authentication) and I can't setup Dropbox. I am convinced that this is a proxy issue as I can't setup Ubuntu one either (but I don't use Ubuntu One so that is not a problem). I have looked at the Ubuntu One fix but it seems to be to modify settings explicitly related to Ubuntu One.

The user tried to upgrade to 11.10, and the upgrade failed because the root partition doesn't have enough free space to perform the upgrade.\nI remember running into a similar problem on a laptop once before, which just had one physical drive but a poorly-thought-out partition scheme; I think I just symlinked a directory from a too-small rootfs partition to a larger partition.  In this case, I think the best solution is to bind-mount whatever directory Ubuntu wants to use to store its downloaded files to the larger drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*What directory (or directories) is the important one that needs to be 'moved' to the larger drive?\n\n*If I can get away with just bind-mounting one directory, do I just need to do it once, at the beginning of the installation, or do I need to add the bind-mount to the fstab (i.e. because the files are still needed after reboot, so the bind-mount needs to be persistent)?\n\n*Is there an easier or better way to accomplish the upgrade?  (Neither a fresh install nor a repartition is an option right now)\n\nA: Well for the directory where apt, aptitude and whatever other package management system you use stores the packages downloaded is /var/cache/apt/archives. If you copy this files to another PCs same cache folder you save yourself from having to download them again from the internet.\nFor the rest I did not understand clearly. if you could please change or add more stuff I could elaborate more here. Sorry buddy.\n\nA: Open a terminal by  searching for it in the dash, and then once you get the user@computer:~$ prompt, type exactly:\nsudo apt-move path-to-your-12GB-device\nand give your password when sudo prompts for it. It will not be shown(not even asterisks). Once you get the user@computer:~$ prompt again, you're good to go.\n\nA: Over half the small hard drive was in /usr, so I just moved /usr to (the unecrypted) /home partition, and bind-mounted /home/usr to /usr, like this:\nsudo su -\nmv /usr /home/\nmkdir /usr\nmount --bind /home/usr /usr\necho \"/home/usr /usr bind defaults,bind 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab\n\nsudo is in /usr/bin, so it's best to login as root first, so you're not stuck without a root session if things go wrong (/home/usr was owned by root with 700 permissions during the mv operation). mount, ls, and mkdir are all in /bin.\nBe sure to have a backup plan ready if you try this: I can't count the number of things that could go wrong.  Also, if I was going to do it again, I'd probably try to copy /usr into /home first (probably using something like rsync, cpio, or tar to preserve file attributes?) and test the bind-mounting before deleting the original /usr.  But this time I got lucky and everything worked out.\n", "Q: How do I download a whole Ubuntu One folder? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDownload of a folder as a whole? \n\nDue to problems with 11.10 I just went back using 10.04.

On 10.04 I seem only to be able to access my files though Firefox and can only download them one by one. \nIS there a way to download a whole folder back to my desktop\n\nA: You could use the desktop client. Just start Ubuntu One, and let it sync.\nIf you don't want to keep on syncing it afterwards, you can remove your computer from the authorized devices list.\n\nA: If you have uploaded files to your Ubuntu One cloud storage and are now setting up a new computer or re-installing your operating system, it's important to not copy over the following folder from a backup copy you may have saved: ~/.local/share/ubuntuone\nAs long as you do not copy that folder over, you are safe to setup Ubuntu One on your computer as you normally would following the setup instructions.\n", "Q: Is it possible to setup a DHCP server only for local virtual machines? I have a quick question. I have a bunch of virtual machines (VMWare Workstation) running on an Ubuntu server and have found that VMWare NAT (DHCP) service is unreliable and slow. I have to use NAT instead of bridging because the server is in a data-center that does not have DHCP and I don't have enough static IP's for all the VMs.\nIs it possible to setup the host (Ubuntu) to be a DHCP server but only for the local virtual machines? \nThe server has two network interfaces, so I'd set eth0 to be a static IP, which connects to the outside world, and eth1 to listen for DHCP. Now, I am thinking if I don't want DHCP to broadcast I would just not connect a cable to eth1 and setup the VM's to use bridging on eth1. That way DHCP would not broadcast through my network but be listening on that interface. \nWould that setup work?\n\nA: Take a look at dnsmasq - the man dnsmasq page says it does DHCP serving with static address assignments. \n", "Q: How to check requiriments for unity 3D? Recently I make an ubuntu oneiric fresh install, but it is deadly slow.

Unity is a Compiz plugin, so the requirements will be the same. Your computer is more than fast enough. Ubuntu will run with 512MB RAM and a 550MHz CPU, though that's won't be lightning. :)\nTry to login using Unity 2D, which you can find by pressing the button next to the password field when you log in. If that is significantly faster, then the cause is your VGA driver, most likely.

I had good running system of v10.04 Ubuntu on my old Acer TravelMate 630 laptop (about 8 years old) for months. Then I upgraded to v11.10 via Update manager and it went like charm. After that, I played with system tweaking, just trivial things like screensaver lock and wallpaper, until I \"discovered\" the option \"Adding hardware driver\" or something like that.\nI let Ubuntu scan my system and it came back with a proprietary, but recommended Nvidia driver. Since my video play and flash rich sites was terribly slow, I hoped to get any improvement by installing something else than generic video driver.\nYes, I thought of my very old Nvidia Mobile2Go graphic card and 2GHz Pentium 4 as possible reason for not very responsive machine, but...\nAnyhow, I let the system update my graphic card driver and it turned out it was a big mistake. After reboot I could not get into my X server anymore. Furthermore, I cannot get to text console neither. Only scrambled screen.\nI can get into text console only trough the GRUB, by pressing shift.\nI read a lot of postings in other forums about similar issues, tried many possible solutions, but none gave relief. I suppose, the main problem is, that I have only wireless Internet connection on my laptop and that is not active when I am in GRUB. I got to console after GRUB, but no command worked in it. In other words, I don't have got the Internet connection when I am in text console.\nOne thing more, I can start Live CD without any problem, but don't know what then.\nPlease, before I install the whole system from the scratch only because of failure of bad video card driver, could anybody tell me how could I get rid of that bad driver without new install?\nThanks very much in advance!\n\nA: Well, sometimes switching to console (STRG-ALT-F1) and X (ALT-F7) several times helps to unscramble the console. Then you can do \"sudo apt-get remove nvidia*\" and it will remove the proprietary drivers. Sometimes you will also have to remove the xorg.conf in /etc/X11:\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nThen reboot and it should work.\n", "Q: How do I speed up my old Ubuntu computer?

Help is appreciated.\nPS:  No, I am not interested in Xubuntu\n\nA: Here is a link to the technical specifications of your machine.\nDell 2400 specs\nNotice that it has integrated graphics/video which uses a maximum of 64MB of system RAM. This is causing the slowdown in screen re-drawing. In my opinion.\nThe machine only has PCI slots, so if you buy a new graphic card make sure that it is PCI and not PCI-E as it will not fit in the machine.\nThe answer to your problem is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a PCI graphic card with as much memory as possible. They will be hard to find. I have just checked the shop where I purchased the parts for my machine and they had only 1 PCI graphic card out of 90 products. The rest were PCI-E.\n\n*Put the cost of a new graphic card towards the cost of a new computer; or\n\n*Use another version of Ubuntu that does not run Unity.\nSorry, if this is not to your liking.

If you don't is like you are hibernating the system.\n\n*If Ubuntu installer reports an empty disk, it's more likely that you have leftover GPT data that needs to be removed.\n\nA: In your windows system run a chkdsk on your disks for faults and relaunch Ubuntu installation.\nAnd while you are in your windows system check your disks under Disk Manager (right click on Computer>Manage>Disk Manager) if it says that your disk is dynamic you wont be able to rezise them so the option of installing side by side cannot be handled by Ubuntu (is a Windows thing).\nIf you have a dynamic disk you have 2 options, format all and reinstall or use Microsft's own solution for converting dynamic disks back to basic. (note: ignore the title and body of that KB, go straight to the workaround). No warranties there!\n\nA: The best thing is to backup your data and re-install Windows.  When you are in the reformat drive screen you can choose to create new partitions.

I have my files in a separate partition that is not mounted to /home, but only linked to it. How do I manage to be able to use the gnome trash in those files?\nFor example:\npartion 2: mounted on /data, with a folder /data/myname\npartion 1: mounted on /, with its own /home and /home/myname, inside it /home/myname/Desktop and /home/myname/Documents link to /data/myname/Desktop and /data/myname/Document respectively. Suppose I have a file /data/myname/Document/example.txt.\nWhen I use nautilus, and try to delete /home/myname/Document/example.txt, Nautilus say it can't use the trash. It took me a while to figure out it is because example.txt is in a different filesystem. I don't know can another trash directory be defined in that partition so that gnome can use it?\nI could have partion 2 mounted as /home with almost simular results --I did that for a long time--, but each time I change the Linux/Ubuntu installation, many configuration files in my home become broken. But in summary this new scheme doesn't allow me to use gnome trash now.\n\nA: When you delete a file on a removable storage device, GNOME automatically creates a trash folder at the device's root. If your user ID is 1000, it will create a file named /data/.Trash-1000. When you go to the Trash place in Nautilus, you see an amalgamation of all the trash folders for your user on all the filesystems that are connected.\nIt sounds like this one is a permissions issue. GNOME is trying to create the trash folder at the device's root, but perhaps your user only has access to individual files under the root. The easiest way about this is to make the thing more accessible. In a terminal, try sudo chmod 777 /data to make the root of your data drive editable to any user. Alternatively, you can do sudo chown yourname /data for a similar effect.\n\nA: GNOMEish file managers need a place to put the trashed files.  Copying them to the 1st partition would be very bad performance.  So it tries to put them in the /.Trash-$UID folder.  Without rw access to that folder, no trash.\nRun this bash in the partition root as the user who needs a trash.\nsudo mkdir .Trash-$UID && sudo chown $USER:$USER .Trash-$UID\n\nNote:  If there is a a rw .Trash folder, Nautilus may create the user's trash folder automatically (/.Trash/$UID).  I haven't tried this, just saw it in some logs.  There are security issues with public trashes. YMMV.\n", "Q: What command is used to start Unity 2D?

I tried to upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10 through the upgrade wizard. I had about 30 minutes left on my install, and had to leave. When I came back, my computer was frozen, so I had to do a hard reset.\nWhen it rebooted, I was shown this screen: \nIt appeared unresponsive, but I could ctrlaltF1 and get to the terminal where I could log in. It appears that I am not connected to the 'net - sudo dhclient only appears to output one line of text rather than the several that it should. ping 192.168.1.1 does nothing, but I can ping localhost -c 4. \nI was hoping that following the instructions here would give me a plain screen without any X startup (that was my theory on why it didn't look good) but it didn't appear to have any effect - also where the author had 7  lines of output, I had only one (which I can't read, of course).\nany ideas about what I can do? I suspect it may be an issue with the video card drivers - I have some NVidia card (computer posts just fine, so I know the issue is after the OS takes over). I don't remember if I installed GRUB, but I didn't see any menu pop up the several times I booted. On two boot-ups it actually showed the Ubuntu splash screen, but there it hung and I couldn't get to the terminal like it does when I get the \"jail\" screen.\nIf I could get it hooked up to the network I have sshd installed (at least I can ssh to localhost, and I could SSH in from other computers before my upgrade), and could log in and see what I could fix that way.\nWorst case scenario, I believe I partitioned off my /home/ directory, so I could reinstall just the OS portion, but I don't really want to do that - I had a lot of problems initially installing Ubuntu with this hardware configuration in the first place and I don't want to go through that again.\nSo any help would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: Since you can get to the console, probably easiest thing to try first is to log in and run:\nsudo apt-get install --fix-broken\nIf the problem is merely that some packages hadn't finished configuring, it should be able to complete that, network or no.\n\nA: Trying:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nworked! There were several cases where it asked for user input, and I just hit enter for most things. There were a few screens where it popped up a curses-style GUI, and I mostly had to guess where the \"OK\" buttons were. After the lengthy process, I did sudo shutdown -r now and when it finished rebooting, I was presented with the new Ubuntu login screen.

I am tired of logging in all the time and entering a keyring so I was hoping that creating an automatic login would resolve that. It didn't, so now I have a broken password and I cannot install any programs and I cannot fix my password. Does anybody have any help for this?  Thank you.\n\nA: Logging in as root instead of your normal account is an Incredibly Bad Idea. During the normal course of things, the only time Ubuntu asks you for a password is when you install new software or updates - and even that can be configured not to require a password, I believe.\nIf you can no longer log in because you don't remember the password, you could reboot to the recovery console and change your user's password from there:\npasswd myusername\n\nhowever, I'm afraid you may've stuffed the permissions up when opening your files as root... you may need to change ownership of your home dir:\nchown -R myusername:myusername /home/myusername\n\n", "Q: After upgrade, iHeart Radio (on the web) no longer plays I used to listen to a radio station (KNRS) online that uses iHeartRadio (www.iheartradio.com) for online radio.  After upgrading to 11.10, it no longer works.  In fact, I have to \"force quit\" to get out of it.  I can't check what format the service uses, as it freezes before I can do anything on the site.  However, it does work with Chromium.\nI can listen to other stations that use different services (such as WLS-AM).  Flash, Banshee, VLC, etc., all work just fine, as far as I can tell.\nThis is the same on two computers: my desktop, and my laptop.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Any ideas or suggestions?\n\nA: There is a clue in this statement of yours:\n\nHowever, it does work with Chromium\n\nThe problem is not due to Ubuntu 11.10 but the other web browser that you want to use to listen to this Internet radio station.\nWhen I try to access the same station using Chromium iheartradio.com blocks me because I do not live in the USA.\nWhen I try using Firefox the program freezes (window greys out) due to using all available system memory and some more of swap memory. (I used System Monitor to check this). Future updates of Firefox might rectify this.\nI use Radio Tray. It is in the Ubuntu Software Centre. I works well with Unit. It puts an icon in the top panel (an app-indicator). You can use it change stations. Right now I am listening to Heartland Public Radio (playing Roger Miller - Dang me). I am listening to an American Internet Radio Station without needing a web browser. It must be better.\nYou need the Internet address of the station's radio stream. You create a new station using that address in the Radio Tray Preferences>Configure Radios option.\nThe address for Heartland Public Radio is http://hpr1.hpr.org. The address for Country108 is http://tuner.country108.com:80.\nI give you these as an example of what to look for. I cannot give the address of the stream for KNRS because I cannot play that station. If you find out the internet address of the KNRS radio stream then you might be able to use Radio Tray to play it. Either that or use Chromium.\nRegards.\n\nA: I recently installed the Flash-Aid plugin for Netscape, and had it get and install the latest 64-bit Flash.  I accepted all defaults during the process.  After doing so, I tried the radio station again and chose to listen live - and it worked just fine.  I think the Flash version that Flash-Aid intalled was a beta version, and evidently this is exactly what I needed.  (And so far, I haven't noticed anything that hasn't worked with it.)  Great!  Now I don't have to run Netscape and Chromium at the same time!\n", "Q: Can't login to Ubuntu anymore Ubuntu no longer lets me login.

I was unable to access my home directory when I was using the console so i changed the permissions of it to 777. When i restarted my computer i was able to login. Very weird. – matthew Oct 20 '11 at 1:12\n\nA: I’ve had the same graphical login problem (on Ubuntu Precise 12.04). The cause was also permission-related but slightly different from the OP’s cause: the .Xauthority file in my home directory was owned by root. Removing that file from a text-mode login screen (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+F1, log in, then sudo rm .Xauthority) solved the graphical login problem for me.\n\nA: Same prob with .Xauthority owned by root.\nFixed by removing it.\nPossibly caused by starting vncserver as root.\n", "Q: How do I make the power button shut the laptop down without asking?

I say estimate above because acpi shows 93% battery, and my script shows 90% battery, so try this script against your GUI battery percentage, and see how off it is.  In my case, it seems to be consistently 3% lower than  acpi's percentage.

Based on the previous answers , I have made a simple script batpower:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Description: Battery  charge in percentage\n\ngrep POWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/uevent\n\nThe output for executing this ( ./batpower ) is going to be something like this:\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY=23\n\nN.B. : the batery number may be different for you, in my case it is BAT1, but you can always find it out by cd'ing to /sys/class/power_supply   or as Lekensteyn mentioned through upower -e\nMy machine : Ubuntu 13.10 , 3.11.0\nReplace BAT1 in the above bash code to BAT0 if you have older version Ubuntu i.e. 13.04 or later. \nIMPROVED SCRIPT: Since my original post, I've made a small improvement to the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Description: Battery  charge in percentage\n\nif [ -f /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/uevent ]\n    then grep POWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/uevent\n\nelse echo \"Battery isn't present\"\n\nfi \n\nAs always, pay attention to spaces with bash. This is all self explanatory. If battery is present, it will show up, if not - the script will tell you so. Now, go to your .bashrc file and add $(batpower) to your prompt. Here's mine promt:\nPS1='[$(batpower)]\\n${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}[*\\u@Ubuntu*]:\\w\\$ ' \n\nUpdate your terminal or open new tab or window, and now you can monitor battery charge constantly in terminal ! including tty ! May the scripting be praised !\n\n\nA: You can do it without installing any extra packages:\n$ echo $((100*$(sed -n \"s/remaining capacity: *\\(.*\\) m[AW]h/\\1/p\" /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state)/$(sed -n \"s/last full capacity: *\\(.*\\) m[AW]h/\\1/p\" /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info)))%\n94%\n\nThis command is lifted from byobu's source. It might be a good candidate for a Bash alias.\n\nA: Similar script without calc or apcalc:\n#! /bin/bash\ncd /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0;\nmax=$(grep 'design capacity:' info|awk '{print $3}')\ncurrent=$(grep 'remaining capacity:' state|awk '{print $3}')\npercent=$(expr $current\"00\" / $max )\necho -e \"Current capacity: \\t$current\"\necho -e \"Max capacity:  \\t$max\"\necho -e \"Percent: \\t\\t$percent\"\n\n\nA: This won't help everyone, but it did me - I use byobu whenever I am using a terminal, and battery is one of the options for the status notifications bar.\n\nA: Here is what I use.

Whats the deal with that?\n\nA: This is a bug. I've experienced the problem as well.  Here is a bug report on the issue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-session/+bug/838792\n", "Q: How to customize the gnome classic panel First the picture:\n\nAs you can see in the image, the colors used for the icons and the words Applications and Places (In spanish in this case) have a different background dark gray color than the rest of the panel. Also the icons look rather bigger in that panel. Now my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can the background colors be customized so they look the same all the way through the panel.\n\n*Can the icons be somehow minimized a little so they don't look strange (bigger actually)\n\n*How to edit the way to add icons to the panel. I have to actually hold the ALT key and right click on it to show the context menu which shows me the option to add something. That extra key press is not friendly at all.\nIn this particular case I am trying to help an older man start in Ubuntu. Unity is too much for him but Gnome is friendlier for him (Learning curve is not the best for older people.. specially 68+ year old people).\n\nA: How to get back a \"GNOME 2 look and feel\" in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot\n1. Install \"GNOME Classic\" session\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\nYou now get the possibility to choose the \"GNOME Classic\" session when you log in, but there are some problems with this session:\n\n\n*\n\n*The top panel's height and its icons are too large\n\n*The panel background is inconsistent\n\n\nGNOME Classic:\n\nWith the fixes below:\n\nAfter turning sound and bluetooth off and on again:\n\nThe fixes also work for the Radiance theme:\n\n2. Reduce the size of the icons to 16 pixels\nThis will also reduce the height of the top panel from 30 to 24 pixels.\n2a. Create folder for config files:\nmkdir ~/.config/gtk-3.0\n\n2b. Create or edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini and add this:\n[Settings]\ngtk-icon-sizes = panel-menu=16,16:gtk-large-toolbar=16,16\n\n3. Fix the panel background\nNote: Instead of the following solution, the background can also be fixed by using:\n(Win-)Alt-rightclick on panel -> Properties -> Background -> Solid color\n3a. Create or edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and add this:\n/* Fallback Mode Panel */\n/* Fix background color (needed in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot). */\n/* Based on /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/gnome-panel.css. */\n\nPanelWidget,\nPanelApplet,\nPanelToplevel {\n    background-color: @dark_bg_color;\n    background-image: none;\n}\n\n.gnome-panel-menu-bar,\nPanelApplet > GtkMenuBar.menubar,\nPanelApplet > GtkMenuBar.menubar.menuitem,\nPanelMenuBar.menubar,\nPanelMenuBar.menubar.menuitem {\n    background-color: @dark_bg_color;\n    background-image: none;\n}\n\nPanelAppletFrame {\n    background-color: @dark_bg_color;\n    background-image: none;\n}\n\nAt this point, you should log out and in again using the \"GNOME Classic\" session in order to see the changes.\n4. Further panel configuration\nUse (Win-)Alt-middleclick-drag and (Win-)Alt-rightclick to configure the panel further.\nNote that the panel items snap to the left/center/right of the panel, so they might need to be dragged some distance before they move at all.\nLaunchers can easily be added by dragging items directly from the Applications menu to the panel.\n5. Fix icon spacing\nThere seems to be a bug which causes excessive spacing between the icons in the notification area tray:\n\nAn easy fix is to change the icons back and forth, e.g. muting/unmuting the sound and disabling/enabling bluetooth. This solution is unfortunately only temporary and must be performed again after each login.\n\nFinal remarks\nMake a note for future reference that you just added two config files in:\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/\n\nThis is nice to know in case the config files mess things up with later Ubuntu releases and need to be removed again.\nResults\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*How to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?\n\nA: if you follow these instructions, you will have an excellent panel, just like we used to in 10.10 and 11.04. it will get you the exact kind of panel that you want :)\nTo install Indicator Applet for GNOME 3 (classic/fallback session) in Ubuntu 11.10, use the commands below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jconti/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-applet indicator-applet-complete indicator-applet-session\n\nTo also install the Global Menu indicator applet for GNOME 3 classic session, use the command below:\nsudo apt-get install indicator-applet-appmenu\n\nOnce installed, you can remove the existing applets that you don't need such as the clock or user menu from the GNOME 3 classic session top panel - to do this, ALT + right click them and select \"Remove\".\nThen, to add the GNOME 3 Indicator Applet to the panel, right click the top panel while holding the ALT key and select \"Add to panel\" and from the applets list, add \"Indicator Applet Complete\". To get a Global Menu, also add \"Indicator Applet Appmenu\".\nPlease note that if you don't remove the notification area (systray) from the top panel, you'll get an extra sound icon. Unfortunately I couldn't find a fix for this. Also, if you want to move/remove the systray, don't ALT+RIGHT CLICK on it but in front of it (there's a very small invisible area).\nAnd a final tip: to fix the panel, ALT + RIGHT CLICK it and for the background, use \"#303030\" color (for Ambiance theme). Alternatively, install a GTK theme that supports the new GNOME 3 panel \nEnjoy :)\n\nA: You must use Alt + Right Click in the panel... In some cases its Super+Alt+Right CLick. You will see the properties option, as well as Add To Panel :-)\n\nA: In short the solution to problem 1 is to correctly set the background image according to the ambiance theme.\nALT+right click on panel and select 'Properties'. Select tab 'Background' and set 'Background image' to /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/apps/img/panel.png\nI found a detailed step-by-step how to with pictures and this solution over here\n\nA: This works, the only problem left is fixing the font color on the Window List.\nEDIT: I found a fix that works for me.  Just include this snippet as well in the gtk.css file:\nPanelApplet .button,\nPanelApplet .button:prelight {\n    color: #aaaaaa;\n}\n\nEDIT2: It appears the fonts were fixed in the theme distributed by Ubuntu now, so this is no longer needed.\n\nA: You can also customize the Applications and Places menu names using the language file.\nI changed \"Applications\" to \"Apps\". This saves some valuable space.\n1) Download the oneiric gnome-panel .po file for your language from bazaar.launchpad.net\n2) Edit the string you wish to change in the .po file. It's easiest to use a UTF-8 text editor, like gedit.\nOriginal:\n    #: ../gnome-panel/panel-menu-bar.c:183\n    msgid \"Applications\"\n    msgstr \"Applications\"\n\nEdited:\n    #: ../gnome-panel/panel-menu-bar.c:183\n    msgid \"Applications\"\n    msgstr \"Apps\"\n\n3) Run msgfmt on your edited file, creating messages.mo. Rename it gnome-panel-3.0.mo, change the owner and group to root.\n4) Make a backup of the file we are going to replace, at /usr/share/locale/?/LC_MESSAGES/gnome-panel-3.0.mo (with ? being the locale you're using). Just in case something goes wrong.\n5) Replace the file at /usr/share/locale/?/LC_MESSAGES/gnome-panel-3.0.mo (with ? being the locale you're using) with your edited file.\n6) Logout and login.

I don't want a Unity on login and want to directly get to a shell in the Guest after the boot. What changes have to be done?\n\nA: Unity is a shell for Gnome. Unless you've setup automatic login, then Unity does not automatically start. Do you mean that you don't want to start the display manager, and get a commandline interface instead? In that case, simply remove lightdm and gdm. You can just reinstall it later if you want to. \n\nA: You can either tell lightdm or gdm (depending on which you use) not to load at start up, or you can tell upstart to boot into run level 3.\nSo either:\nsudo update-rc.d -f lightdm remove\n\nor\nsudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove\n\nor\nsudo gedit /etc/inittab\n\nand change the run level to 3\n\nA: If you don't want to use the GUI, installing the server version is the best option as it will only install the needed files.\nIf you want to use the GUI occasionally, Jo-Erlend Schinstad's answer, uninstalling *gdm is a great solution.\nIf for some reason you don't want to uninstall the gdm, then you can prevent it from running at boot editing your /etc/init/ligthdm.conf file, or the equivalent file if you are using another dm. Just change the line that reads:\nstart on ((filesystem\n           and runlevel [!06]\n           ...\n\nto:\nstart on ((filesystem\n           and runlevel [!0123456]\n           ...\n\nThis condition will never met (the computer is always in one of those run-levels) and it will never start.\n", "Q: Source code for 'df' command Can someone tell me how to locate the source code for the 'df' command.

Dell even replaced my motherboard to check for hardware issues but the problem persists. So it is definitely not a hardware issue. \nThe sound plays perfectly through the headphones in the pre-boot diagnostics.

It was only playing a few system sounds through them and then ignoring that they were plugged in all together. Playing music through speakers etc. while they were in. \nAfter fiddling around for an hour or so and reading different solutions I simply decided to set my speakers to the default communications device in control panel under the \"sound\" option (Win 7). Afterwards I tried playing some music and my headphones were back to normal. \nAll of the problems had been fixed. Not sure why exactly the audio went haywire. Probably a combination of Skype and Steam trying to control the sound at the same time. Give it a shot if you're having similar problems.\n\nA: I have a dell inspiron laptop that hasn't let sound come from the headphone jack for six months until now, the solution is keep replugging your headphones and one day a dialog box will come up saying what did you just put in?

I have quite a few large files, [500MB/+] and every single one I've tried has 5 to 42 extents found.\nWhat's going on? I have EXT4, and I have 185G of 515G free [63% used].\nI thought EXT3 and EXT4 didn't fragment files [unless absolutely necessary].  I did restore all my files actually, from a NTFS partition  [My ext. hdd is NTFS. I've thought about formatting it to EXT, but it's 0.5TB and would take a long time to recopy my files] after I switched to a new laptop a week ago.\nSo how do I defragment these files, and why are they fragmented?\n\nA: On the subject of extents:\n\nExtents replace the traditional block mapping scheme used by ext2/3\n  filesystems. An extent is a range of contiguous physical blocks,\n  improving large file performance and reducing fragmentation. A single\n  extent in ext4 can map up to 128 MiB of contiguous space with a 4 KiB\n  block size.\n\n(from wikipedia)\n128 Mb per extent gives about 4 extents per 500Mb file for absolutely the best possible scenario. Are your \"more fragmented\" files in 5Gb size range? Also, this doesn't necessary mean you have that many non-continuous regions... extents may follow each other on disk.\nI believe fragmentation is an issue when you have thousands of non-continuous regions each of which is a few kilobytes in size. If your extents are many tens or hundreds of megabytes in size any effects on performance are negligible. Relax.\n", "Q: The keyboard sometimes doesn't work I just installed Oneiric.

I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and my screensaver keeps coming on while I'm watching a movie.  I don't remember this happening in 11.04 and can't remember how to stop it?  \n\nA: Another solution but not what you want is:\nOpen the terminal and type:\nxset s off\nThis will disable the screensaver.\nto enable it again\nxset s on\n\nThere are other options such as disabling for a period of time etc..\nType man xset in the terminal for more info\n\nA: I've seen this happening with VLC as well as Banshee.  The only solution I could find is to run Caffeine.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nAfter that, run caffeine, go to its preferences and have it start on login.  It sits in your system tray.  Whenever you then watch a movie, you'll need to click on its system tray icon and select 'disable screensaver'.  \nIt is not the best solution but it is the only one I can see in these early days. \n\nA: *\n\n*Open VLC Media player and go to Tools -> Preferences (Shortcut key is CtrlP) \n\n*Select All from Show settings in the bottom-left corner of the Preferences window .\n\n*Now click the Video Tab on the side.\n\n*Now tick the Disable Screensaver box and click save.\n\n\n\n\nA: From my answer on Unix.SE, you can simply run,\necho \"disable-screensaver=0\" >> ~/.config/vlc/vlcrc\n\nFor more information see \"When using VLC, why does my screen saver keep waking up?\"\n\nA: Expanding on this answer, one can type\nxset s on; vlc; xset s off;\n\nfrom a terminal to launch vlc, or write a bash script\n#!/bin/bash\nxset s on; vlc; xset s off;\n\nor a desktop file whose command is something like \nset s on; vlc %U; xset s off;\n\nand set the association file/mimetype to it to open appropriate mimetypes.\n\"%U\" works for TDE, for other desktops, you might need to find the right syntax.\n\nA: In case you are using xscreensaver and the GUI options do not help, you can use the following funciton to run VLC from the command line:\nvlc() { xscreensaver-command -exit; command vlc \"$@\"; nohup xscreensaver -no-splash } \n\n\nA: I made a script which can close xscreensaver when VLC is open, and even closes redshift (eye protector app) when it exists.\nYou can try it from here:\nClose-Screensaver-Redshift-when-VLC-opened-Script\n", "Q: How to install pymedia without compiling prereq's from source? I'm trying to install pymedia: http://pymedia.org/ on ubuntu.  I'm fine with building pymedia itself from source, as that seems my only option, but I'd rather not have source built versions of its prerequisites lying around if I can avoid it. \nI installed most of the prereq's with the following:\nsudo apt-get install python-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libfaad-dev libasound2-dev libmp3lame-dev\nThen I downloaded the pymedia source tarball and ran:\npython setup.py build\nWith that I get:\nOGG          : found\nVORBIS       : found\nFAAD         : found\nMP3LAME      : found\nVORBISENC    : found\nALSA         : found\nContinue building pymedia ?

You can try to disable that function (just replace all the code with a pass statement) and try to compile it again. It shoul read something like this:\ndef disable_fPIC():\n    pass\n\nI can't test it as my machine is 32bits, so I can just hope that it helps.\n", "Q: Where are the session managers logs? Unity 3D refuses to start here, always falling back to Unity 2D. I installed both Gnome and XFCE 4 and neither starts, but instead leave me with the mouse cursor and the wallpaper. I want to know what is happening. Where are the session manager logs? Where can I see what processes failed to start? Where can I read what they printed to stdout and stderr before they crashed or failed to start properly?\n\nA: The file you should take a look at is ~/.xsession-errors in your home directory (note, that this collects output from all the graphical programs you start, so not everything you can see there has to be related to your problem).\nIf there are issues with the greeter/LightDM, then you can go through the logs in /var/log/lightdm (I assume you are using Ubuntu 11.10).\n", "Q: New connection doesn't show up in list of networks I added a new profile for wired connection in Ubuntu's network manager|Edit Connections|Wired, but the new connection doesn't show up in the list of networks when I click on the network icon in system tray. \nDoes anyone know how to fix it?\n\nA: How did you set up the new wired connection?

And I guess this is HTML5 notification which is currently unsupported.

On one computer it works like a charm, but on another computer the super does not show the activities window. Mousing over the top-left corner does bring up the window, so I am not totally blocked, but I am really missing being able to just press the key to get there.\nDoes anybody have a clue how I could fix this?\n[update]\nIn System Settings, Keyboard, there is an option to change the shortcut for Show the activities overview, but I can't set it to super (I guess because it is considered to be a modifier-key). Any idea how I can solve that?\n\n\nA: Okay. You might have locked your super button.\nTry unlock it on your keyboard. It usually has two icons - a window key and a lock.\nIn my case, I have unlocked the super button by pressing\nRight Fn + F12\nThen everything is working perfectly.\nUpdate:\nMy another keyboard is unlocked with FN + WINDOW key.\n\nA: Under gnome 3.4.2.1, I had to use \"Meta is mapped to Win keys\".\nNow shortcuts with Super key work now.\n\nA: finally found it myself.\nIn older Ubuntu versions, go to System Settings > Keyboard Layout > Layouts and then choose Options.\nIn newer Ubuntu versions, install Tweaks (sudo apt install gnome-tweaks) and open it, then Keyboard & Mouse and then choose Additional Layout Options.\nThere is an option for the Alt/Win key behaviour and there I had the option selected Meta is mapped to Win keys.\nDeselecting that option, and choosing Alt and meta are on Alt keys fixes it for me. At least the super is working again to access the Activities. Not quite sure what the impact is of this choice.\n\n\nA: In my case, I figured it was because \"Overview Shortcut\" was mapped to \"Left Super\", but I was clicking on \"Right Super\".\nInstall tweaks and go to \"Keyboard & Mouse\" tab as follows:\n\n\nA: In case you use a laptop stand with an additional keyboard unplugging re plugging the additional keyboard might fix the issue with the super/activity key.\n\nA: Gnome tweaks does not work for me. You can see the shortcuts from Settings > Keyboard > View and Customize Shortcuts, as the OP suggests.\nGnome developers apparently decided to map it to <Super + S> at some point. I can't change it back to Super either, but this at least tells you what it is mapped to.\n\n", "Q: How do I archive/compress files using the right click menu in Nautilus-elementary?

So somebody please tell me what I might be missing? Some of the things in Unity are really irritating.\nI did have nautilus from the nautilus-elementary ppa installed instead of the normal version.\n\nA: I found it.

I am running Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric with Gnome Classic and Compiz.\nWhen I open some applications, they appear near the top of the screen, underneath the top panel. This means I can't grab the to bar of the window to move them.\nIs there a way I can prevent this, either by controlling where the default space on the desktop is to open new windows, or by creating some space around the top panel which they can't go into?\n\nA: There is a compiz plugin that can handle window placement. Called \"place\". You can read more about it here and how to set it up. \n", "Q: How can I open the Applications and Files lenses from command line? Can someone tell me if there is a application or script that can be called from the terminal screen that will bring up the Find Applications or Find Files window that comes up when you click the More Apps an Find Files button in the Dash Home?\nThanks in advance for any comments suggestions.\n\nA: Install the package xdotool, then you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Applications lens:\nxdotool keydown super sleep 0.1 key a keyup super\n\n\n*Open the Files lens:\nxdotool keydown super sleep 0.1 key f keyup super\n\n\n*Open the Music lens:\nxdotool keydown super sleep 0.1 key m keyup super\n\n", "Q: iPhone mount errors When I plug my iPhone (iOS 5) into my laptop with Ubuntu 11.10, I get this error: \n\nUnable to mount Documents on iPhone.

Because when booting the system, i am given options to choose which version of Ubuntu I want to boot up. \nThere is not any obvious difference between the separate options i am given.\nHow do I clear the files/options I do not need?\n\nA: i guess you mean all the different older Kernels you still have listed in grub.\nYou can search them using the Synaptic Package Manager:\nsearch for linux-image and you will get a list of installed kernels.\nBefore uninstalling the not needed ones, first open a terminal and invoke:\nuname -r\n\nThis will give you an output stating the currently running kernel.

It's very strange because when I connect my Logitech keyboard is set on the American layout, but the one of the PC is still on the swiss french layout. \n\nA: Old bluetooth pairings might not be 100% compatible with newer/upgraded Ubuntu 11.10.\nSimply remove the keyboard from the list of paired devices, then \"re-pair/reconnect\" it.\nUse the \"connect\" button underneath the keyboard.\nOnce it's been paired again, the correct layout should be active.\nIt's generally a good idea to unpair/re-pair all bluetooth devices after a system upgrade, as the bluetooth profiles and drivers has been updated.\nNew features won't activate until a device has been paired anew.\n", "Q: How to make Unity Dash Background darker?

At first the Wifi didn't work so I ran \nrfkill unblock wifi\nrfkill unblock all\nmodprobe -r acer_wmi\n\nNow the Wifi works, however when I try to Suspend/Hibernate the computer. It gets stuck. \nWhat should I do?\nUpdate \nWhenever I try to run pm-hibernate, the computer goes into hibernation for a split second and comes back.\n\nA: Edit: Just noticed that the acer_wmi module doesn't really have much to do with your suspend problem - more than it's blocking suspend. If you find the module responsible for blocking suspend, just switch out  its name with acer_wmi in the following suggestions, but without finding the responsible module, my suggestions probably aren't going to help you too much.\n\nThe traditional way of troubleshooting suspend where there's a known driver issue is to force the unloading of that module before suspend. You'd do that by running\nsudoedit /etc/default/acpi-support\n\nAnd looking for the MODULES=\"\" line and changing it to (in your case):\nMODULES=\"acer_wmi\"\n\nBut reading the comments at the top of /etc/default/acpi-support, I'm not sure that's still going to work. Give it a go.\nIf it doesn't, you might find a short script like this fixes things:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nrmmod acer_wmi\npm-hibernate\nmodprobe acer_wmi\n\nThat will need to be run as root, so whereever you save it, you'll want to run it like: sudo bash ~/my-suspend-script.\nI feel like there should be a good way to hack this into the /etc/pm/sleep.d/ system but I don't know enough about it to say conclusively. Perhaps something like this:\n#! /bin/sh\n\ncase $1 in\n     suspend|suspend_hybrid|hibernate)\n        rmmod acer_wmi\n        ;;\n     resume|thaw)\n        modprobe acer_wmi\n        ;;\nesac\n\nThat would be cleanest in terms of integration if editing acpi-support doesn't work.\n\nA: Installing the tlp package fixed any problems I had with suspend on my Lenovo S205.\ncredit\n", "Q: How to remove keyboard indicator? /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/general/disable_indicator in gconf is set to yes\nAdditionally I restarted, but it's still there.\nMaybe there is some setting buried in CCSM?\n\nhere is screenshot of what I'm talking about if it's not clear:\n\nI want to remove it if possible\n\nA: In version 13.10 and newer of Ubuntu you can just tick it off in Text 'entry settings' (last menu options when you click the keyboard icon).

Then click on Text Entry\n\n*In the bottom of the window you’ll see “Show current input source in the menu bar” which is enabled by default. Uncheck the box and the indicator applet will disappear instantly.\n\nA: You can very simply do this in Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity desktop for the current user in the terminal by issuing the following command.\ngsettings set com.canonical.indicator.keyboard visible false\n\nIf the user is not logged into a currently running Unity session, you can set the setting by running this.\ndbus-launch --exit-with-session gsettings set com.canonical.indicator.keyboard visible false\n\n\nA: If you wished to remove the Keyboard icon and keep the Language selector then it is as follows:\n@ Terminal \n\n\n*\n\n*find /usr/share/icons/ -name \"input-keyboard.??g\" -exec sudo mv {} {}.old \\;\n\n*for i in $(find /usr/share/icons/ -name '.old'); do sudo mv $i ${i%.}; done\nIf you wished to remove both the Keyboard icon and the Language selector then it is as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Configuration Editor\n\n*Click Apps --> gnome_settings_daemon --> plugins --> Keyboard --> Unchecked 'Active' \n\n*Log out and log in.

I have bought a domain name (without hosting), and at home I have a static ip address on Ubuntu server 11.04. How can I redirect users to my web server at home? What configuration needs to be done?\n\nA: If your registrar has DNS, you just need to create an A Record in your DNS entries for your domain. This A record would point to your static IP address. Consult your registrar documentation on how to do this.\nIf it is not the case, you will have to setup a nameserver, or have to use a 3 a DNS service like dnsexit\n\nA: I don't know about purchasing a domain name that you can't point to an IP address so I can't help there (does this mean there are no configuration options for it) but I can suggest what needs to be done on your side of the net.\n\n\n*\n\n*Give your webserver a static IP address on its local network.\n\n*Set your modem to forward incomming traffic to your webservers IP\n\n*Configure your firewall.\n\n*Make sure you have apache2 installed and dump your site under /var/www/\n\n\nStep 1 can be done by taking the IP, netmask and gateway that your currently using and adding it into the IPv4 Settings of the network adapter you use to connect to the net. \nTo find your current settings use connection info under network settings in the top panel (by the time), and you can configure your adapter from there too. NOTE: This isn't the static IP that you bought from your ISP.\nStep 2 will require logging into the modems web interface and trawling around until you find settings for Port Forwarding (somewhere around NAT or Address Translation). Add an entry to set port 80 (TCP protocol) (if given the option use 80 for public and local ports) to point to your IP that you set in Step 1 and apply the settings.\nFor step 3 I use firestarter but you can also use ufw (uncomplicated firewall) which is installed by default on Ubuntu (I haven't used it but here is a guide to setting up ufw). If you install it (available from Software Centre), open it and click the policy tab. Add a new service policy, select HTTP for the name, 80 for the port and the source is 'Anyone'. Click add and then apply the settings with the tick icon.\nYour modem should also tell you what your WAN address is if you don't know it (or find your IP online. That's the address you want to point your domain name to (not the IP you gave your webserver in step 2). Also, you should be able to check that your webserver is accessible to the world by entering your webserver's WAN address directly in a browser address bar (you must either by outside of your home network, or use a free proxy server (which you can find at proxy.org) to break out of your network).\n\nA: If your domain name provider provides DNS servers too, you should only add A record with your IP to it.\nElse, you should install DNS server(i.e bind9) on your computer, add zone - your domain here and after that use it as DNS server on your domain provider\n\nA: Well! Your static IP will pointed to your domain when you make changes in DNA record.It probably requires registrar advice.First of all you should note all the DNS records and informations before moving for registrar suggestions. To know the DNS record details make a DNS look up at WhoisXY.com website where i had checked my DNS information and further did the configuration.\n", "Q: Package emacs-snapshot-nox has unmet dependencies I'm trying to install emacs24 for an external repository, but I receive an error regarding unmet dependencies and wonder how I can continue the installation and resolve this error?\nThe output looks like this:\ndito@dito:~$ sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot-nox\nReading package lists...

I plan to install 11.10.\nI plan to partition in such a manner that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I put the files that (almost) never change on the SSD and mount it as a read-only partition.\n\n*I put /home/ on the HD (and other locations that routinely are written to during normal operations, see question 1 below)\n\n\nI basically want to not worry about the SSD getting worn out.\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What other locations (than /home) need to be put on the read-write hard drive?\n\n*I need to modify my system from time to time: install some new packages, update packages, edit /etc/ configuration files, whatever. Is it possible set the read-only partition temporarily to read-write, do the changes and then change it back to read-only?\n\n\nUpdate\nSome interesting links:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.logicsupply.com/blog/2009/01/27/how-to-build-a-read-only-linux-system/\n\n*http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Network_boot_from_read-only_server\nUpdate 2\nMore interesting links. The first link describes an effort to replace various filesystem locations that stores transient state files with a /run toplevel location.\n\nMaking the /run directory available brings us a step closer to the\n  point where it is possible to use the system normally with the root\n  filesystem mounted read-only, without requiring any clunky workarounds\n  such as aufs/unionfs overlays.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/RunDirectory\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs\n\nA: You don't have to worry about the lifetime of your SSD. It'll last years, even with heavy I/O happening every day. Just use it as you would use a HDD. The only thing you need is setting the vm.swappiness to a lower value.  \nThere are many other things, values that are 'said' to improve SSDs lifetime. However, every time they do some calculation the results show that even an older SSD would last 5+ years. And we are talking about the first SSDs.\n\nA: I agree with others saying that making an SSD read-only may be a bit too much, but if you still want to tinker with it as a fun exercise, you may look at using UnionFS for making your SSD read-only (well, almost).\nThe point of UnionFS is that you have 2 partitions - data is read from partition #1 (your SSD), but if it's written, it's written to partition #2 (HDD in your case), from which point the new data \"hides\" the data on the first partition, so for programs it looks like there's a single read-write partition.\nObviously, after you continue modifying data on the UnuinFS partition for some time (system updates etc), more and more data migrate to the HDD and SSD is used less and less. You may need to come up with some solution to move the data from HDD to SSD from time to time.\nWith this approach you could even not bother with \"which directories should I move to partitions on HDD\" - the filesystem will figure it out by itself. \n\nA: I recently bought a PC with SSD + HDD like you and did something similar, dividing the partitions. However, I did not set the SDD to read-only (just my decision, not that is something better or worse).\nConcerned about avoiding excesive writing, I put /tmp /var and /swap (apart from obviously /home) in the HDD, following mostly this link:\nhttp://bandaancha.eu/tema/1680390/instalar-ubuntu-ssd-hd\nI am sorry it's in Spanish, but you can say the partitions graphic anyway. Of course you can set the partitions with different sizes (I did) \n\nA: That'd be no use. Every file or folder needs to be written to once in a while. It's like that with every operating system. If you want to spare you SSD, put the Ubuntu live ISO on your SSD (like you'd do with a USB drive), configure a persistent filesystem on the HDD for it, and configure it to use a partition on the HDD as your home folder (and storage for the persistent filesystem file). The result would be that all there is on the SSD drive would be an ISO file (wich is read-only).\n", "Q: Will not boot to prompt after do-release-upgrade; gdm not running xserver Oneiric will not boot to prompt after do-release-upgrade; gdm not running xserver but it will boot a previous kernel version.

Add as many sources as you want.\n\nA: This is hardly ideal, but it is a workaround based on fossfreedom's post (sorry, I don't have the reputation to post a comment on an answer). \nCreate a folder somewhere that you don't mind keeping it, but is out of the way.  Put links to all the folders you would like in your library into this newly created folder. \nNow, do a nautilus search in the newly created folder, and search for \" \" (i.e., search for the space character, which for some reason seems to be the wildcard in nautilus searches).  This will search for everything in that folder recursively (and following the links). \nSave the search as fossfreedom described.\nThis has the advantage of getting all files, not just ones matching a specific search term, and the advantage of only looking in specified folders.

Previously in Ubuntu, up until version 11.04, once I set the master volume to a level, it stays that way (regardless if I turn the machine off and back on) until I manually change it.  Apparently, in version 11.10, there is a default master volume setting.  No matter what I set my volume to, when I reboot the system, it always returns to that default setting (which for my tastes is a trifle too loud).  Is there any way to change that default setting to the setting that I wish (about 50%)?\n\nA: Have you tried using alsamixer (man page) and alsactl (man page)? They are command line tool for alsa.  \nI usually just type: alsamixer, and when I'm done, alsactl store.\nYou may need to use sudo alsamixer and sudo alsactl store. May. Not neccessarily.  \n\nA: I fixed this by choosing my desired volume level then typing the following:\nsudo alsactl store\nrm -r ~/.pulse ~/.pulse-cookie\n\nThe first line saves the desired volume (as explained at Wrong audio volume at boot), this didn't solve my issue by itself, on boot (the login scree) the volume was correct but after logging in the volume was at max again for my user. \nThe second line then cleared any cached settings for my user so the desired volume was set on both boot and login.

Any advice gratefully received\n\nA: Add this to your Startup Applications (look for it on your dash):\nwine \"<pathtoyourapplication\"\nYou will have to know where your application is (usually inside your /home/.wine/drive_c folder, look for it) but after adding it your application will run on startup.\n\nA: Click the dashboard home button and type in \"start up applications\" (without the quotes) and you should be able to open the Startup Applications program.\nSetting a Windows program to run at startup via Wine is as easy as adding a startup application with a command that's something like this:\nwine \"/home/jeffy/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/herp/derp.exe\"\n\nHere the quotation marks are important, as without them, spaces would not register properly as part of the text in the command.\nObviously, you'll have to put the path to your .exe file instead of the sample path I put, but that should be a start.

All of the references I've found for Gnome 3 keyboard shortcuts list that alt+tab switches between applications and alt+` switches between windows (some actually say alt+~, but I think they're mistaken, and I've tried both anyway). Maybe that functionality works for Gnome 3 on Fedora or something, because no matter the key combo I try, nothing will switch between windows except for opening the alt+tab dialog and using arrow keys to navigate it (and at that point it's faster to just use a mouse..).\nHow do I quickly switch between windows in Gnome 3?\n\nA: In GNOME 3, you can permanently change Alt+Tab to switch between windows, instead of switching between applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Select Devices->Keyboard\n\n*Search for \"Switch Windows\" and enter Alt+Tab as the new shortcut.\n\n*A dialog will tell you the shortcut is already being used by \"Switch Applications\", select Replace to confirm.\n\n\nA: In GNOME Shell, you should be able to switch between multiple windows of the same app by running Alt + the key above tab on your keyboard. For US users, that shortcut is Alt + ` but other keyboard layouts are different.\nThis is different than Unity in Ubuntu 11.10 which uses Alt + ` for all layouts. (I expect that behavior would improve in Ubuntu 12.04).\n\nA: I know this question is old but it was a top result when I searched this problem and there's no solution here. \nThe solution that I, and I think the OP, was looking for is\nSuper+Tab. \nThis is the \"change applications\" action in the keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: Check the shortcut tab in gnome's keyboard settings.\nFor me (Ubuntu 13.10), Switch windows of one application is set to Alt+Caps+Tab.\nAdditionall, there is the Alt+F6 shortcut to immediately switch windows of one application – it only applys to one workspace.\n\nA: \nNote: the Alternatetab extension was deprecated as of GNOME 3.30 in favor of the built-in \"Switch Windows\" keyboard shortcut\n\nGNOME Tweak Tool at Extensions tab has an \"Alternatetab\" option, that allows to use standard Alt + Tab to switch between windows without grouping them.\nGNOME tweak tool could be installed as follows:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nAlternateTab extension could be found here: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/15/alternatetab/\n\nA: Hit alt-tab to get to the app-switching \"toast message\" (the big balloon with the icon that appears in the middle of your screen).\nWith alt key down, then hit the arrow keys -> <- to go to the left and right in the app menu. So you need two hands to switch between applications. \nOn my 13.10, after hitting the left-arrow or right arrow keys once, the alt-tab left-hand-only key-combination continues to work again.\n\nA: In ubuntu 12.04 precise pangolin you go to\nCompizConfig Settings Manager > Window Management\nand tick \"Static Application Switcher\"\nTo install CCSM:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n\nA: On my french Ubuntu 18.04 instance, I change, as wrote by @jesus-h :\nSwitch window of an application directly or something like that (changer de fenêtre d'une application directement in french),\nfrom Alt+F6 to Alt+F1 which I can do with left hand\nI enjoyed in ubuntu 14 or/and 16 to switch beetween windows in application using mouse wheel over left application icon.  \nI have quite permanently two firefox windows, one usual for my agenda and trusted web sites (my nextcloud agenda, my job gitlab…) and one private for \"all comming\" web sites to avoid permanent cookies and traces\n\nA: To switch between windows of same application:\nAlt + ~\nThat is Alt + tilde\n", "Q: Need help installing a 32bit app on my 11.10 64bit.

How do I manage (add/remove) all the startup applications in Ubuntu 11.10 and up?\nStartup Applications doesn't show all the applications which are started during boot.\n\nA: It's normal that you don't see anything listed. The Additional startup programs list is just for programs that start up for the current user (not necessarily for other users, and not all the services that start when Ubuntu boots). Furthermore, it doesn't list the normal parts of the desktop environment that start when the user logs in graphically.\n\nAnyone can check this by clicking \"Startup applications\". Its blank by default.\n\nIf you want to have the hidden startup entries shown (such as update notifier, orca screen reader, onboard, etc), just type/copy and paste the following in a terminal:\nfind /etc/xdg/autostart ~/.config/autostart -name \\*.desktop -exec sudo sed –i -e '/^NoDisplay=/d' {} +\n\nIf you want to hide the normally hidden entries, just type/copy and paste the following\necho NoDisplay=true | find /etc/xdg/autostart ~/.config/autostart -name \\*.desktop -exec sudo tee -a {} + >/dev/null\n\nSource: How-To Geek\n\nA: As said above, you have to edit /etc/xdg/autostart/ and either:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove the NoDisplay=true lines;\n\n*or make those same lines comments by adding # in front of them;\n\n*or replace true by false in those same lines.\n\n\nThe third solution can be easily done in three steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Summon the terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T.\n\n*Type the two following commands:\ncd /etc/xdg/autostart/\nsudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' *.desktop\n\nAfter changing anything you want, you can go back to the previous state by typing this into the terminal:\nsudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=false/NoDisplay=true/g' *.desktop\n\nThis has been tested in 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04.\n[Source: iloveubuntu.net, thank you Nikhil Sinha for the link]\n\nA: An alternative: \nTo view all startup applications at \"startup applications\" just open /etc/xdg/autostart and modifying the line NoDisplay=true to #NoDisplay=true. Just add an # . \nThen you will be able to see all at \"startup applications\" and disable what you want from there. \n\nA: Remove the NoDisplay=true line from each entry in /etc/xdg/autostart/ Then just uncheck the ones you don't want in Startup Applications. Generally though the autostart apps are there for a reason so make sure you know what you're doing when you disable them.\nThere are also various services which store their configuration files in /etc/init. Most users shouldn't touch those files though.\n\nA: The correct way to do this as a normal user is to copy the desktop file in question from /etc/xdg/autostart/ to ~/.config/autostart/ (create the directory first if needed) and edit this copy to state NoDisplay=false. Then open \"Startup Applications Preferences\" and uncheck the corresponding box.\nNow you need to remove the NoDisplay=true key from the files after copying them, which can be done with sed for all of them with\nsed -i '/NoDisplay=true/s/^/#/' ~/.config/autostart/*.desktop\n\n", "Q: Are there any free, high quality, career mode games for Ubuntu?

How can I set the profile in a way that persists across reboots?\n\nA: To make default settings for the pulseaudio daemon we can edit /etc/pulse/default.pa (as root) to give a default source or sink in the last section by uncommenting the corresponding lines and give in the name of our output sink and input source:\n### Make some devices default\nset-default-sink <name_of_sink>\nset-default-source <name_of_source>\n\nIn case your sound card needs a specific profile we can also add the follwing line:\nset-card-profile <cardindex> <profilename>\n\nPlease make a backup of this file before editing to be able to restore the default setting.\nIn case you are unsure what name your sink has you can issue the following command in a terminal to list all sinks presently active:\npacmd list-sinks\n\nTo test if the sink is correct we can issue\npacmd set-default-sink <nameofsink>\n\nin a terminal before we change the default.pa.

I am getting most frustrated by the fact that once I have opened Firefox, I can't enter any other commands!\n\nA: This works for me.\nIf you're 'locked out' like you explain, then you can use keyboard shortcuts to gain some control.

[This might solve your particular issue.] \nI still haven't figured out how to properly get DESKTOP CUBE going with 11.10 .\n", "Q: Find out whether network connection is full or half duplex How do I find out whether a network connection is full or half duplex?\n\nA: You can use mii-tool :\n$ sudo mii-tool \neth0: negotiated 100baseTx-FD flow-control, link ok\n\n'FD' is full duplex.  'HD' would represent half.  For those who haven't seen this, it's because it generally represents a network problem -- you should always see and expect full.  \nIf you don't have mii-tool installed, it is in the net-tools package:\n$ dpkg -S mii-tool\nnet-tools: /usr/share/man/man8/mii-tool.8.gz\nnet-tools: /sbin/mii-tool\n\nI believe it is included with a base install, however.\nIn some cases, dmesg will be sufficient.\nIdentify your local interface and check dmesg:  \n$ dmesg | grep -i duplex\n[   31.920900] e1000e: eth0 NIC Link is Up 100 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: Rx/Tx\n\n", "Q: Which package should I download to compile C++0x code OS is Ubuntu 10.04.\nI need to compile some C++ code with -std=c++0x flag.

There are install instruction within each PPA's page.\nObviously, PPAs contain unofficial packages, so YMMV.\n\nA: I think this PPA has gcc 4.6.1 : Toolchain test builds.

Since I upgraded to oneric ocelot it only works 10% of the time. What program are they using to log the touchpad and how can I change it back. Both people who upgraded and who installed it directly reported the same problem so it appears to be the fault of oneric.\n\nA: This solution woks for me\nGo to:\nhttp://tombuntu.com/index.php/2011/10/31/fix-for-touchpad-trouble-in-ubuntu-11-10/\nFrom the post:\nOne of the issues introduced by Ubuntu 11.10 on my Eee PC 901 is touchpad dragging. The tap-and-drag gesture, for moving the cursor with the mouse button depressed, is too sensitive. I have to tap as fast I can to activate the gesture every time\nRun this command to get the timeout before a tap is interpreted as a single tap:\nsynclient | grep \"SingleTapTimeout\"\nOn my system this option was set to 180, which is too fast. Run this command to double the timeout to 360:\nsynclient SingleTapTimeout=360\nThanks go to Tom.\n\nA: I have a half answer for you and am having the same problem. The 10% of the time it works you are probably tapping twice very fast, that's when it actually works as you want. You can change your behavior (tap faster twice then drag) to get what you want, but a fuller solution fixing the double tap timing along with drag would be ideal.\nI have no real solution but can tell you something that doesn't work but should. Go to launcher / search using the super key (windows key usually), type mouse, then choose \"Mouse and Touchpad\". You can change the double click time spacing and double click will trigger with longer time between taps but the double click then drag motion won't be affected. I personally notice this when trying to select text. I'd upvote this post but don't have enough repuation... Accept this as a partial answer and I'll upvote when I get enough rep. Hope this helps, found any better solution?\n\nA: I found a persistent fix, even after suspending, following these steps.\nFirst, create a file with your configuration script:\necho synclient SingleTapTimeout=320 FastTaps=1 > ~/etc/touchpad_settings.sh\n\nSecond, make it executable:\nchmod +x ~/etc/touchpad_settings.sh\n\nAnd finally, run the following command replacing \"<user>\" with your user name:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.input-devices hotplug-command \"/home/<user>/etc/touchpad_settings.sh\"\n\nThen reboot, or logout & login, or suspend & resume, or restart GNOME.\nEnjoy!\nFor more information about this fix, see this blog post.\n\nA: For me the issue was generated by Option \"TapAndDragGesture\" \"0\" so I have set it to 1 and it works now\nto do a temp test run this command\nsynclient TapAndDragGesture=1\nthen if it is ok you can edit your xorg configuration file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/... to make it permanent\nas reference:\nman synaptics\n\nor\n    - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics\nConfig example:\n  - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics/10-synaptics.conf_example\nhere my file content\nSection \"InputClass\"\n  Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n  Driver \"synaptics\"\n  MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    # Enable touchpad\n    Option \"TouchpadOff\"        \"0\"\n    # Allow run-time configuration\n    # Option \"SHMConfig\"           \"on\"  # deprecated\n    # Edge Limits\n    Option \"LeftEdge\" \"1748\"\n    Option \"RightEdge\" \"5640\"\n    Option \"TopEdge\" \"1274\"\n    Option \"BottomEdge\" \"4752\"\n    # Speed\n    Option \"MinSpeed\" \"1.0\"\n    Option \"MaxSpeed\" \"1.6\"\n    Option \"AccelFactor\" \"0.032\"\n    # Pressure\n    Option \"FingerLow\" \"24\"\n    Option \"FingerHigh\" \"29\"\n    Option \"FingerPress\" \"255\"\n    # Tapping Detection\n    Option \"MaxTapTime\" \"180\"             # 0 disables tap\n    Option \"MaxTapMove\" \"29\"\n    Option \"MaxDoubleTapTime\" \"180\"\n    Option \"SingleTapTimeout\" \"200\"\n    Option \"ClickTime\" \"100\"\n    Option \"TapAndDragGesture\" \"1\"\n    # Corner Tap Buttons\n    Option \"RTCornerButton\" \"0\"\n    Option \"RBCornerButton\" \"0\"\n    Option \"LTCornerButton\" \"0\"\n    Option \"LBCornerButton\" \"0\"\n    # Scrolling Edges\n    Option \"VertEdgeScroll\" \"0\"\n    Option \"VertScrollDelta\" \"100\"\n    Option \"HorizEdgeScroll\" \"0\"\n    Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"100\"\n    # Circular Scrolling\n    Option \"CircularScrolling\" \"0\"\n    Option \"CircScrollDelta\" \"0.1\"\n    Option \"CircScrollTrigger\" \"0\"\n    Option \"FastTaps\" \"1\"\n    # Tapping as Buttons (number of fingers)\n    Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"TapButton2\" \"2\"\n    Option \"TapButton3\" \"3\"\n    # Tap Dragging\n    Option \"LockedDrags\" \"0\"\n    Option \"LockedDragTimeout\" \"5000\"\n    # Tap Gesture Dragging\n    # Two Finger Scrolling\n    Option \"VertTwoFingerScroll\" \"1\"\n    Option \"HorizTwoFingerScroll\" \"1\"\n    # Corner Coasting\n    Option \"CornerCoasting\" \"0\"\n    Option \"CoastingSpeed\" \"20\"\n    Option \"CoastingFriction\" \"50\"\n    # Kernel Event Protocol\n    Option \"GrabEventDevice\" \"1\"\n    # Edge Ignore Boundaries\n    Option \"AreaLeftEdge\" \"0\"\n    Option \"AreaRightEdge\" \"0\"\n    Option \"AreaTopEdge\" \"0\"\n    Option \"AreaBottomEdge\" \"0\"\n    # Trackstick\n    Option \"TrackstickSpeed\" \"40\"\n    # Circular Trackpad\n    Option \"CircularPad\" \"0\"\n    # Multi-function Buttons\n    Option \"ClickFinger1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"ClickFinger2\" \"1\"\n    Option \"ClickFinger3\" \"1\"\n    # Edge Movements\n    Option \"FastTaps\" \"0\"\n    # Tapping as Buttons (number of fingers)\n    Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"TapButton2\" \"2\"\n    Option \"TapButton3\" \"3\"\n    # Tap Dragging\n    Option \"LockedDrags\" \"0\"\n    Option \"LockedDragTimeout\" \"5000\"\n    # Tap Gesture Dragging\n    Option \"EdgeMotionMinZ\" \"29\"\n    Option \"EdgeMotionMaxZ\" \"159\"\n    Option \"EdgeMotionMinSpeed\" \"1\"\n    Option \"EdgeMotionMaxSpeed\" \"401\"\n    Option \"EdgeMotionUseAlways\" \"0\"\n    # Pressure Motion\n    Option \"PressureMotionMinZ\" \"29\"\n    Option \"PressureMotionMaxZ\" \"159\"\n    Option \"PressureMotionMinFactor\" \"1\"\n    Option \"PressureMotionMaxFactor\" \"1\"\n    # Emulations\n    Option \"EmulateMidButtonTime\" \"75\"\n    Option \"EmulateTwoFingerMinZ\" \"280\"\n    Option \"EmulateTwoFingerMinW\" \"70\n    # Palm Detection\n    Option \"PalmDetect\" \"1\"\n    Option \"PalmMinWidth\" \"10\"\n    Option \"PalmMinZ\" \"199\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: What does \"System-wide settings will be cleared\" mean?

I have a separate primary root (/) and a /home partition. During the upgrade the primary root partition was changed to logical, and the /home filesystem was retained as another logical partition, while having a new /home.\nThe / was reformatted and thus the system-wide settings are cleared, but the old /home was saved onto a new partition.

So usually there are two options to work around:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deinstall PulseAudio: If you deinstall PulseAudio you will have normal working sound at every startup. However most user find PulseAudio very convenient. So this might not what you want.\n\n*Change Audio Settings: Open gnome-volume-control (Alt+F2 and enter gnome-volume-control or System -> Preferences -> Sound). Look at the tab Hardware and check if the correct soundcard is configured. Below is a menu called Profile. Try different profiles and see if they work. It is hard to say what is the correct option for you. A forum post suggested \"Analog Surround 5.1\", but it depends from your soundcard.

Last time I had a root part with 40Gb that got almost full... and my data was in other partition!\n\nA: I use 15gb for my root partition, and 2.8gb for swap space, it is entirely up to you though and as mentioned above, a, very personal, taste....\n", "Q: script to swap two files one thing that always drove me crazy is the need to do\n mv file1 tmp\n mv file2 file1\n mv tmp file2\n\nin oder to swap 2 filenames.\nwhat do you guys use to swap 2 files? Are there any standard script for swaping?\n something like sw file1 file2 would be nice\n\nA: I would suggest going with a bash script instead of playing with bash.conf.\nIf you're getting into Unix systems you'll need to learn shell scripting at some point.\n\nA: Suggestion would be to add to bash a function that will swap two files:\nnano .bashrc\n\npaste in at the bottom of the file:\nfunction swap()         \n{\n  if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: swap file1 file2\"\n  else\n    local TMPFILE=$(mktemp)\n    mv \"$1\" $TMPFILE\n    mv \"$2\" \"$1\"\n    mv $TMPFILE \"$2\"\n  fi\n}\n\neither logout/login or run:\nsource .bashrc\n\nTo swap two files run:\nswap x y\n\nwhere x and y are your file-names\nsource\n\nA: This script does 2 things: \n\n\n*\n\n*checks if you didn't by mistake use wrong number of arguments\n\n*checks if both arguments are files (don't mistype and use a directory or something).\n\n\nIf it fails any of those 2 checks it will tell you how to run the script, else you will have your files swapped.\n#! /bin/sh\n\nif [ ! $# = 2 -o ! -f $1 -o ! -f $2 ]\nthen\n    echo \"Usage: `basename $0` file1 file2.\"\n    exit\nfi\n\nmv $1 cop_$1\nmv $2 $1\nmv cop_$1 $2\n\nSave it in your home, use chmod +x <scriptname>.sh to make it executable, move it to your /usr/bin/ with the command sudo cp <scriptname>.sh /usr/bin/.\nNow you can use <nameofthescrip> file1 file2 to swap files.\n\nA: I agree with Bruno, the shell script is more the norm for adding command type functionality.  I offer additional suggestions:\n1- for the Usage, do not include the period at the end of the message.  You are trying to show syntax and the message\n\"Usage: swap file1 file2.\"\nis possibly misleading, it is not a sentence and should just say:\n\"Usage: swap file1 file2\"\n2- Placing the file in /use/bin makes it a system command.  While your personal Ubuntu install may tolerate this, when you decided to re-install from scratch you capture your home directory, not /usr/bin.  I suggest you create $HOME/bin, add that to your search path, and place all your scripts in that directory.  Your bin directory is your personal trove of additional commands.\n3- If you place the function in bashrc then it is only available in a bash shell, if you want swap available regardless of shell, then a shell script in a bin directory is more universal and standard.\n4- In the script I suggest that the exit after the Usage output be changed to \"exit 1\" and after the last line (third mv command) add \"exit 0\".  The exit code indicates success or failure.  If you ever write other scripts that use swap, they can check the exit code to see if there was success or failure.\n5- Instead of cop_$1 which assumes the file cop_ does not exist, I suggest the mktemp function, using the --tmpdir option it creates the temp file in the current directory.  This guarantees no conflicting file names.\nPutting this all together I offer the following:\n#!/bin/sh \nif [ ! $# = 2 ] ; then\n    echo \"Usage: `basename $0` file1 file2\"\n    echo \"Two file names are required.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\nif [ ! -f $1 -o ! -f $2 ] ; then\n    echo \"Usage: `basename $0` file1 file2\"\n    echo \"Only file names are allowed.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nTEMP=`mktemp --tmpdir=.`\n\nmv $1 ${TEMP}\nmv $2 $1\nmv ${TEMP} $2\nexit 0\n\nNow put this in the bin directory under your home directory.  Make sure your PATH variable picks up this home directory echo $PATH.  If it does not, the PATH is set in your shell initialization resources (.bashrc or .cshrc or ???).\ncd\nmkdir bin\nnano swap\n< now paste the above script into the file, save, and exit>\nchmod 755 swap\nnano $HOME/.bashrc\n< now add the following 2 lines at the end of the file, save, and exit>\n# user specific pathing\nPATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n\nNow you either start a new bash shell, or reprocess the .bashrc file:\nsource .bashrc\n\nNew login or shells should be automatic.\nThats it.  Test with just a swap command and you should see the usage text.\n", "Q: Two battery icons after installing \"Jupiter\" applet, but only in one account I have three accounts set up on my netbook, and the Jupiter applet installed to help with battery life.

I've created it using Disk Utility, so I suppose it's using ecryptfs.\nSince it is not home, it doesn't get automatically configured to be mounted at login.\nI need it to be mounted on login (not boot). I suppose one can make Gnome to run a little script on login that mounts it, but all methods I have found on the net need root privileges.\nI have my home dir encrypted and it doesn't require me to enter a passphrase (I guess it uses my login password). I would like a similar solution for the data partition.\nThere should be a way, since home automatically mounts, but there isn't and it needs me to enter a pass, it would be less convenient but would also work.\nAny ideas? I'm using Ubuntu Oneiric 64bit.\nThanks!!\n\nA: Automatically mounting an encrypted partition rather defeats the purpose of encrypting it in the first place. This makes it to where anyone going through your startup scripts on the non-encrypted sector can easily jack into the encrypted.\nIf you're still set on doing this you can set it in rc.conf. You could also use a C program to have a setuid run to mount it, but this is a monstrous security risk as well.\n", "Q: Proxy settings not working I just installed Ubuntu 11.10 with Wubi and I am currently on a campus that requires the usage of a proxy server. I went into System Settings/Network/Proxy Settings. Didn't work. I manually set the proxy in Firefox and I do have access to the internet; however, I cannot add apps or update Ubuntu. How can I fix it? Thanks\n\nA: On my fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 64bits, this worked for command line with apt and Ubuntu Software Center.\nCreate the file /etc/apt/apt.conf and put this line with your proxy settings :\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://login:password@yourproxyaddress:port\";\n\nexample : \nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://bob:123bob@bobproxy:8070\";\n\n\nA: Two steps are required to get internet fully working in a proxified environment:\nGnome\nProvide the proxy URL to the gnome-network-properties:\n\nShell\nAdd following to /etc/environment:\nftp_proxy=\"ftp://username:password@proxy.com:8080/\"\nhttp_proxy=\"http://username:password@proxy.com:8080/\"\nhttps_proxy=\"https://username:password@proxy.com:8080/\"\n\nOr\nAdd following to your .bashrc:\nexport ftp_proxy=\"ftp://username:password@proxy.com:8080/\"\nexport http_proxy=\"http://username:password@proxy.com:8080/\"\nexport https_proxy=\"https://username:password@proxy.com:8080/\"\n\nPlease note, however, in case if proxy environment variables are set in .bashrc, commands that are being executed under different user privileges will not have this variables set (sudo will fail, for example). To get past this you might need to modify .bashrc of these users as well. In case of sudo, it is enough to execute it with -i argument, so it will preserve existing environment (sudo -i apt-get update will actually work without modifying root's .bashrc file).\n\nA: I'm going to presume that your proxy settings are a URL to a server somewhere on campus, which probably means that you are using a PAC script. If your proxy settings do not consist of a URL, ignore this answer.\nFirefox should work fine if you set the system proxy settings to this URL and it is set to use system settings.\nAlas, the system settings just deliver the script URL to applications querying what the proxy should be - while browsers, and other apps which share browser codebases (like Thunderbird) are quite happy with PAC scripts, most applications are not. This includes many of the core system applications.\nIf your proxy config is delivered via PAC script, the best thing to do is to download it using your browser, and read through it looking for the actual addresses and ports of your proxy servers. Then use these to populate the manual proxy settings, which should work for more applications.\n\nA: It may seem strange, but installing Synaptic on 11.10 and configuring the proxy and authentication settings there fixed apt-get as well. \nI tried lots of things before that, I set the proxy settings everywhere I could (system settings, /etc/apt.conf, /etc/apt.conf.d/*, gconf-editor, environment variables), but nothing helped - apt-get update still hanged and tcpdump was showing it was trying to directly access 91.189.92.180.80. \nChanging the settings with Synaptic fixed that. I actually hate this obscurity, it resembles Windows. However, it worked for me.\n\nA: I've have the same issue in my campus, but I' have no acces to internet, however you may try to \"apply system wide settings\" in the same window you configure the proxy.\n\nA: I found a way which is working but it is very tedious.\n1.

As I understand it, the Asus Eee PC 1215N has an Nvidia ION2 GPU and an Intel graphics unit. On Ubuntu 11.04, the current Nvidia driver is installed, but not used. When I run nvidia-xconfig it creates an xorg.conf file, but X does not start with that.\nHow do I get OpenGL support running? Is there a way to use the Intel card, or does only the Nvidia support 3D?\nIf only the Nvidia ION2 supports 3D, how do I get a working xorg.conf for the Nvidia GPU?     \nUPDATE (2nd January 2012): I have now found that installing Ironhide works for me on the Asus Eee PC 1215n. There are several questions where Ironhide, and its predecessor Bumblebee, are discussed, but most were outdated.\nThe Linux Hybrid Graphics project has been moving very fast, changing names, features, web addresses and setup. It took me a few hours to figure out what was what. Anyway, the good news is, you can install Ironhide with the Ubuntu Software Center. Ironhide provides a GUI in which you can choose a profile for your device. I had to reboot before everything worked properly. You can also switch between Nvidia and Intel GPU with a console script provided by Ironhide.\nOnce setup correctly, graphics acceleration works and battery duration increases significantly, e.g. over 5:00 hrs, instead of 3:40 hrs, with Wifi on!\n\nA: This sounds very similar to a problem I just solved on my Asus laptop. It has an integrated Intel graphics card and an Nvidia card in some weird configuration called Optimus where the Intel card runs most of the time because it consumes less power, and then it delegates to the Nvidia card when you run more complex graphics.\nRemoving the Nvidia driver let the Intel card run properly, and OpenGL now works for me.\nDuring my installation of Ubuntu 11.10, it prompted me to install the Nvidia driver, and I installed it. Most things ran fine, I could watch videos, browse the web, and run drawing or painting programs without problems. However, anything that used OpenGL wouldn't work. I first tried to find out what version of OpenGL I had installed:\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\nglxinfo | grep \"OpenGL version\"\n\nGlxinfo failed, and I got errors something like this:\nXlib: extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib: extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib: extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib: extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib: extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib: extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\n\nI tried running sudo nvidia-xconfig and got this warning: \nVALIDATION ERROR: Data incomplete in file /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Device section \"Default Device\" must have a Driver line.\nAfter a bunch of digging, I came across a description of the Optimus configuration. I used lspci to confirm that I did have that configuration:\nlspci | grep VGA\n\nIt showed that I have two graphics cards:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device 0df6 (rev a1)\n\nI then followed the instructions to remove the nVidia driver.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into recovery mode. It came up with a second menu that included something like \"continue with normal boot.\" That brought up the desktop in a lower resolution than usual, so I assume it was recovery mode.\n\n*I launched System Settings, and then Additional Drivers.\n\n*I removed the Nvidia driver.\n\n*I rebooted, and OpenGL started working.\n\n\nSome of this is from memory, but I hope it's close enough to help. It sounds like there are some more advanced ways to use the Optimus configuration with Ubuntu, but I'm happy for now. Also interesting is this answer on Optimus configurations.\n\nA: Apologies for the confusion, we (the Bumblebee Project team) realized that there was indeed a lot confusion about the proper project to use.\nIronhide is not that current and it's in fact deprecated because it supplies with so-called ACPI calls which haven't been confirmed without knowledge of it. There is the \"old MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abandoned\" (ppa:mj-casalogic/bumblebee) and the newest \"Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee\" (ppa:bumblebee/stable). For a history, see http://wiki.bumblebee-project.org/History-of-the-project\nIronhide hasn't received major updates since September 2011 and may break your machine (inability to use the graphics card) when uninstalling it if power management is enabled (requiring a reboot). Bumblebee (from the Bumblebee Project team) has several developers using various distributions, resulting in a more stable program with a higher quality level. Installation instructions can be found on Is a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu?\nBumblebee 3.0 was recently released with better support for Power Management.

To do this, restart your computer and, in the GRUB menu screen, type the 'c' key. The GRUB prompt will be shown.\nIn the GRUB prompt you should type the command 'vbeinfo' and hit Enter. GRUB will show the supported resolutions that can be used by it with your video card. After taking a look (and, if you want, writting them in a paper) you can hit 'Esc' and start Ubuntu.\nIn Ubuntu, I suggest that you check the file /etc/default/grub and, if you want, you can change the parameter GRUB_GFXMODE (the default value is 640x480). Note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE (i.e., the supported resolutions that you looked previously).\nIf you change the parameter, you should run the update-grub command:\nsudo update-grub\nI hope this can help you.\nRegards,\nRafael.\n", "Q: How to open the Synaptic Package Manager in Unity?

(Example: I currently have a chromium window opened. When I press Right then the cube rotates as it should. When it gets to the new side the chromium window 'flashes' for a moment--even though it's on the other side of the cube.)\nAlso, (and this is mostly what I want to fix), when I use Right/Left (it should 'rotate Right/Left with window') the awesome animation of the window 'bending' around the cube occurs, but when it gets to the new side it 'flashes' and doesn't come back. It's still on the original cube face.\nSorry for my lengthy description... any ideas?\nEdit: Forgot to say: I did this on my laptop running ubuntu 11.10. Thought it might have been just a laptop thing, but I installed ubuntu 11.10 on my desktop today and it did the same thing.\n\nA: The move to other cube face - causes a \"flash\" is registered as a bug at Ubuntu's launchpad: \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/874862\nYou can subscribe - to get mails on the subject, including when the bug will be fixed, at the above link.\nAs for the \"move window to other cube face\" - which doesn't move the window - looking for a solution to that myself - a really useful feature.\n\nA: Though this bug haven't yet been solved for 12.04 LTS, there exist a hack described here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/862430/comments/194\nGo to the mentioned PPA (don't add it!), use 'View package details' link, expand the 'Source' to show all available packages and download compiz-plugins_... package for your architecture. Do not install it, open it with any archive manager instead and extract only one file /usr/lib/compiz/libcube.so from it and put this file into ~/.compiz-1/plugins (create this folder if it isn't exist). Then reboot your system and observe the famous cube without window flashes. Tested in Ubuntu 12.04.2, GNOME Classic and Compiz 0.9.7.12-0ubuntu2. Kudos to the guys who made it possible.\nP.S. You can also fix the movement of the windows to another cube face with shortcuts, take a look at my post here: https://askubuntu.com/a/344541. If cube plugin activation crashes your Compiz, you can activate it in config file, this method is also described in this post.\n", "Q: My only account is not in the sudo group I installed Ubuntu 11.10 with a username fooname.

I have a 2nd Ubuntu machine, but I don't use that enough to be too worried about it. Use is ideally to offload all storage except for system (which can then run off a 30GB flash drive). The main machine also runs Myth front/backends. Both are on a wired network currently.\nI have got a basic setup working, mounted over NFS, but have some issues, and whenever I look for answers, I seem to get unto the UbuntuServer domain, with what seems like more detail than I want in an answer.\nQuestions I have identified so far:\n1) Sharing UIDs to get file permissions correct. LDAP or something else? What is necessary to make this work?\n2) Mounting an NFS device reliably. Do I just add it in fstab or is some sort of auto-mount advisable? Its a wired network, but I shouldn't need to worry about reboot after power-outages and sequencing...\n\nA: Sharing UIDs\nAssuming that the NAS is running a variant of Linux, and you have root access (if not I guess you need to ask QNAP), you have three options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Manually sync /etc/passwd between the two boxes (passwd is the file that contains the username/userid mapping).\n\n*LDAP \n\n*NIS\n\n\nIf there are just a few users that don't change very often, the manual sync is probably the simplest. You need to keep the NAS system users the same, just add the relevant client users. Make a copy of the passwd file before changing it, so you can revert if necessary.\nSee the Ubuntu NFS HowTo, User Permissions.\nMounting\nMounting in fstab is probably the simplest.\nSomething like\n//my-nas/share   /mnt/nas    nfs   rw,hard,intr    0  0\n\nshould do the trick. \nThe hard and intr mount options are recommended by the Linux NFS HowTo. They will cause client programs to hang if the NAS is down (hard), but will let you kill them (intr). (The alternative is that file access returns an error, which according to the Linux NFS HowTo most programs cannot handle gracefully, and is \"a recipe for corrupted files and lost data\".)\n", "Q: How to prevent screensaver from locking the screen in Unity Just upgraded to 11.10 and there is one pretty annoying thing: whenever Unity decides that my laptop was idle for too long, the screen goes black and -- the most annoying part -- locks up.\nThus, two questions: how do I configure this \"idle\" period and how do I prevent the screen from locking up in this case?\nThank you.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is open up the System Settings,  Dash -> System Settings  and select your screen.\nYou should be prompted with the following screen options;\n\nYou simply need to choose a setting that suits your needs - if you do not want the screen to turn off simply select 'Never'\n\nYou can also choose whether you want to 'Lock' the screen as well.

Recently, I did the upgrade for Ubuntu 11.04 and I have a much longer startup, as well as time to launch some programs.\nCan this problem be solved?\n\nA: Since 11.04 the boot times and the startup times of the desktop have been a bit more \"sluggish\" then previous versions, there is not much you can do about.\nMaybe a fresh install will give you some extra speed but no miracles there.\nUbuntu 11.04 and 11.10 are noticed to be a bit slower.\n\nA: Just to make a small point. Don't judge a book by it's cover. In this case, the cover for a Linux distribution is the loading/startup time. Yes, comparing 11.10 or 11.04 to 10.10 is not fair since one of 10.10's goal was faster boot time. For 11.04 and 11.10 the goal is not make it more user friendly, speed up typical tasks, be more compatible, be faster (after loading the OS), less bugs in general, up to date versions of apps, more security, more efficiency and so on and so forth.\nBasically you have this question: Which was is better?\n\n\n*\n\n*An Ubuntu System that loads REALLY FAST but has problems with some tools, does not detect latest hardware, webcams, printers or has some problems with them. Does not have latest version of X software. The user interface for certain tasks is clearly lacking. Doing some activies seem like is slow. The partition format has not fixed X problem so I still get \"that\" particular problem from time to time...\n\n*An Ubuntu System that loads SLOWER but, in exchange for that slowness you get updated tools, better performance in general when the OS loads, better security, a more slick and polish environment (In any case, Gnome-Shell, Unity or KDE), more apps, specially more NEW apps. Some examples are the Software Center in 10.10 versus the one 11.10. I mean for the love of Linux the change is awesome. Another is the new bunch of hardware that it support now. 10.10 does not detect as much hardware as 11.10.\nYes, they could had worked on the booting speed but if by doing so they would have left some other part unfinished. Would you had liked that change?. For example change performance when the OS loads Versus boot time. so then you get a System that boots OMG FAST!!! but when inside the whole system responds like some really old mummy. And I do not mean any just mummy. I mean like really slow zombie mummy that will eat your brai... CPU.\nSo that is basically the real question when regarding this. For example, when quoting Mark Shuttleworth for each version he had this to say:\n10.10 - \"...This is a time of change, and we’re not afraid to surprise people with a bold move if the opportunity for dramatic improvement presents itself...Meerkats are, of course, light, fast and social – everything we want in a Perfect 10. We’re booting really fast these days, but the final push remains...\" - Key Here: Speed\n11.04 - Was going to quote a paragraph but that thing is huge since it takes the whole thing to give an idea of what will happen in 11.04. Here is the link to \"Naughty Narwhal\": http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/478 - Key Here: A WHOLE WACKY BUNCH OF THEM!\n11.10 - \"Oneiric means “dreamy”, and the combination with Ocelot reminds me of the way innovation happens: part daydream, part discipline. We’ll need to keep up the pace of innovation on all fronts post-Natty. Our desktop has come together beautifully, and in the next release we’ll complete the cycle of making it available to all users, with a 2D experience to complement the OpenGL based Unity for those with the hardware to handle it. The introduction of Qt means we’ll be giving developers even more options for how they can produce interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically delightful.\" - Key Here: INNOVATION.\n12.04 - \"12.04 is an LTS. So we want it to be tough and long-lasting, reliable, solid as a rock and well defended. It’s also going to be the face of Ubuntu for large deployments for a long time, so we want it to have no loose ends, we want it to be coherent, neat.\" - Key Here: Stability and Compatibility.\nThis might not be a direct answer but it is an answer as to why the slowness and what to think of it. Stability Versus Speed?. Compatibility Versus Speed?. Latest Technology Versus Speed?. Who knows, maybe 12.04 or 12.10 will be SUPER FAST!\n\nA: I've adjusted swappiness in /proc/sys/vm/swappiness and noticed a large difference in boot time. Here's how to do it:\nThe default setting in Ubuntu is swappiness=60. Reducing the default value of swappiness will probably improve overall performance for a typical Ubuntu desktop installation. A value of swappiness=10 is recommended, but feel free to experiment. Note: Ubuntu server installations have different performance requirements to desktop systems, and the default value of 60 is likely more suitable.\nTo check the swappiness value\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\nTo change the swappiness value A temporary change (lost on reboot) with a swappiness value of 10 can be made with\nsudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10\nTo make a change permanent, edit the configuration file with your favorite editor:\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\nSearch for vm.swappiness and change its value as desired. If vm.swappiness does not exist, add it to the end of the file like so:\nvm.swappiness=10\nSave the file and reboot. \nTry this at your own risk though, I assume no responsibility. \n", "Q: How to only place/size *first* matching window? Using 11.04 with the Unity interface and Compiz 3D, via the CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm, not installed by default but very useful) I can use the \"Place Windows\" plug-in to set the default placement of a window, and the \"Window Rules\" plug-in to set the default size of a window, which is very handy. (Be nice if I didn't have to duplicate the rules, but hey, *nix is all about small pieces working together...)\nIs there any way I can set up those rules so that they only apply if the window being opened is the only match for them? E.g., not to the second or third matching window that I open? (Example: The first time I open Chrome, I want it at X,Y with size W,H, but if I hit Ctrl+N, I want that second window placed according to the general rules, not my fixed rule.) Or would I have to fall back to wmctrl and/or Devil's Pie scripts for that sort of thing?\n\nA: Okay, the answer would appear to be no, you can't do this with the \"Place Windows\" and \"Window Rules\" plug-ins. Instead, you have to use wmctrl and/or Devil's Pie.\nIn my case, just by way of example, I removed all of \"Place Windows\" / \"Window Rules\" stuff for Chrome and used wmctrl by creating a customized google-chrome.desktop file with some scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the usual google-chrome.desktop file:\ncp /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*Edit ~/.local/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\n\n*Find the Exec= line and change it to point to a script in a convenient location:\nExec=/home/tjc/bin/runchrome %U\n\nMy runchrome script just calls my generalized runandmove script with the arguments I want to use for Chrome:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# For 1440x900:\nrunandmove \"Google Chrome\" 0 246 0 1025 875 /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome $*\n\nThose numbers are workspace x y width height.\nMy runandmove script — no thing of beauty — is:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# runandmove looks to see if a program with a given title is already running.

Nor did installing all compiz-plugins* and wmctrl packages and reloading Compiz.\nEdit - 1: I installed CompizConfig Settings Manager but nothing jumped out at me to change.  \nWhat might have changed between the LiveCD and the installation?\nEdit - 2: After continuing to look for a solution I've realized my terms don't mean what I meant them to.  By snapping I mean the feature termed Aerosnap in MS Windows where dragging a window to the left/right/top of desktop will cause the window to be sized to fill the left half/right half/all of the screen.\nEdit:This install is running on a Dell E6420 with a nVidia Corporation GF108 [Quadro NVS 4200M] Video card.  I am selecting \"Ubuntu\" on the login screen but end up with unity-2d-panel and unity-2d-launcher processes running upon login.  \n\nA: After learning that Ubuntu was running Unity 2D I started suspecting that there was a problem with my video drivers.  \nI purged nvidia-current* and nvidia-settings* packages and rebooted (turns out logging off and on again is all that is necessary).  \nLogging in again the \"aerosnapping\" now works so I'd consider this answered.\nNow to figure out how to get these drivers correctly installed.\n\n", "Q: How to do window placement without the numpad?

The new Kernel 3.0 partially solved some issues related with overheating and absence/or/unstable wi-fi connection. But I see no improvements in power management when it comes to battery life: it only lasts for 3/4 hours on Linux (7/8 hours on Windows Starter). When using Windows, the Toshiba software, mainly, the Eco Utility, are decisive to achieve those results. I wonder if anyone knows a specific trick to increase battery life on this netbook in Linux.

I want to create a user with administrative privileges and all the regular setups like home directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a adduser parameter to give the user sudo powers automatically?\n\n*What are the default settings for adduser? Will it automatically create home directories and all the other things without extra parameters? (i.e. is adduser <username> enough?)\n\n\nA: Add the user to the sudo group with:\nadduser <username> sudo\n\n(If you're running Ubuntu 11.10 or earlier, use the admin group.)\nDefault values are stored in /etc/adduser.conf, you can check them with\nless /etc/adduser.conf\n\nTo create a user and add it directly to the sudo group use\nadduser <username> --group sudo\n\n(Again, use admin in place of sudo for 11.10 and earlier.) \nHave a look at all the options you have with adduser here.\n\nA: To create a new user with admin privileges in Ubuntu 12.04 and later:\nadduser <username> --ingroup sudo\n\nIn Ubuntu 11.10 and earlier, use this instead:\nadduser <username> --group admin\n\nTo modify a existing user (12.04 and later):\nadduser <username> --group sudo\n\nor\nsudo usermod -aG sudo <username>\n\n(Or for 11.10 and earlier: sudo usermod -aG admin <username>)\n-a stands for append whereas -G stands for groups. With the -a and -G flags as shown above, the sudo (or admin) group will be added to the list of groups of which the user is a member.\n\nA: The other answers are correct but you also asked about the home directory.  You will also need a password for the new user.  \nsudo useradd *new-admin-username* -s /bin/bash -g sudo -m\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-s sets the user's login shell\n\n*-m makes the user's home directory if it doesn't exist:\n/home/*new-admin-username*\n\n*-g adds the user to the sudo group so they will have admin privileges (>11.10)  \n\n\nOnce created, add a password for the user:\nsudo passwd *new-admin-username*\n\nLogin to the user to see if everything worked:   \nsu *new-admin-username*\ncd ~/\npwd\n\n\nA: Here's the one liner, It creates a new root user.

The \"all services down\" effect often comes from that. If so and you still have access to your server you can flush the iptables settings:\nsudo iptables -F INPUT\nsudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT\n\nDo it only if you are sure that you want to reset your firewall config. ACCEPT everything is the default firewall config.

Installed 11.10 from USB stick, apt-get updates and favorite installs, everything was fine. Then I booted from USB stick again and did:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1M\n\nand after that I cannot boot. BIOS says I have no bootable drives. Don't even get as far as grub. Booting from USB stick sees both drives and the files successfully copied (so I did not dd the wrong direction). It is as if when the second drive was blank the first drive worked, but now that they are identical the BIOS does not know what to do.\nUpdate 1:\nChecking the \"BIOS confused\" idea I physically disconnected one drive and booted from the other. No joy, on either drive. It is as if the blank drive had something that was helping the boot sequence, and the dd overwrote it!\nUpdate 2:\nSince it is not even getting to GRUB I thought I would try to recreate the MBR. update-grub just recreated an (identical) grub.cfg. grub-install /dev/sda said \"grub-setup: warn: This GPT partition label has no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible!\" I don't think I want to embed anything, just rewrite the MBR. grub-setup /dev/sda said Segmentation fault (core dumped)\nUpdate 3:\nGave up, did:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\nand reinstalled Ubuntu from CD. Still won't boot! It is as if the brand new 3TB drives (Seagate, if it matters) had some little helper boot code on them and when I installed Ubuntu it overwrote that. Of course it is too late to confirm that now, since both drives were overwritten once I did the dd.\nHas anyone heard of a brand new drive not being really blank?\nUpdate 4:\nOK now my hypothesis is that my BIOS cannot boot to a GPT partitioned drive, at least not a 3TB one. If I repartition it as MSDOS it boots, if I go back to GPT it doesn't again.\nHappy to post details but don't know what would be relevant. TIA!\n\nA: Did you format either drive and ensure that they are marked as bootable? There is usually a flag that marks a disk bootable. You may want to check that with the liveCD or liveUSB\n\nA: It should not have worked in the first place.  If you are using GPT in a bios booting machine, you must create a small ( 1 mb ) bios_grub partition for grub to install.  Also do not use dd like that; the filesystems on both disks will appear to have the same UUID and confuse things.\n\nA: OK it is working now and I was even able to dd the entire drive and boot from either one. The solution was to use an MSDOS partition table instead of GPT. It seems my BIOS (on a brand new Gateway computer, BOIS dated 2011-08-01) cannot boot a GPT partition table, at least not on a 3TB drive. I don't know whether that is a flaw in Ubuntu and how it creates the GPT partition table, or whether it is a deficiency in my BOIS.\nHaving booted from a live CD image, I used gparted to create an MSDOS partition table on one of the drives. I laid out my partitions, making sure none were bigger than 2TB because MSDOS partition table doesn't like that. (Unfortunately I cannot get all 3TB on one partition this way...)\nWith the partitions established I then proceeded to install 11.04 from the live CD. After getting everything set up on 3TB drive #1, I did:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1M\nand when it was done I could boot from either disk with no troubles. This gives me a fully bootable backup disk in case the primary ever dies. As others have noted in the comments, using dd to make a backup bootable disk like this requires you to disable the UUID nonsense in /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/grub.cfg (by editing /etc/default/grub).\nThanks to all who tried to help.\n\nA: I have had similar issues before with this sort of thing.

Why can't the \"Launcher\" Icons be made smaller? At the smallest setting, they are still 4 times bigger than they need to be on a 10\" Netbook. The Icons in the \"Top Panel\" are much smaller and we users don't have a problem selecting them.\n\nA: 12.04\nOther than modifying the source code itself, the current size limit for icons on the launcher is 32 pixels, sorry!\n\nA: 12.04\nSee  here  why launcher icon less than 32 pixels is not currently allowed. Be sure to read  14th  Comment.\nThough this is frustrating for people with smaller screen, currently it seems there is no solution available.  \n\nA: 14.04\nFrom 14.04 the launcher icon size can be reduced below 32 pixels in size - all the way down to 16 pixels.\nPictures paint a thousand words:\nStandard size:\n\nSmallest size:\n\nhow to\n\n\n\nA: 12.04 and later\nAm guessing that when you say \"smallest setting\" you mean the Unity plugin in the CCSM (CompizConfig System Manager). For the moment the 32 value in the Experimental Tab for the \"Launcher Icon Size\" is the smallest that is available. I also believe a smaller value should be available. 28, 24, 20, 18 to a minimum like 8x8 (For people like me with insect precise eyes).\nThere is an option with gconf-editor in the schemas/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/icon_size address. But the value is  and currently is not editable. It will soon be however.\nUPDATE - Starting with 13.04, users will be able to resize the icons from 8 to 64 through the CCSM.\nFirst install the CCSM (Compiz Config Settings Manager) if you have not yet done so:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager`\n\nIn Dash, type cc which should show the Compiz Config Settings Manager app. Open it and go to the Unity plugin:\n\nSelect the Launcher tab:\n\nChange the value in the Launcher Icon Size option:\n\nYou can change it from 8 to 64. The only deal is, if you right click the Desktop and select Change Desktop Background, the value for the icons found there will be the one applied. Right now, both, the CCSM Icon size and the Desktop Icon size or not using the same variable for this.\nAs suggested by Ben Lutgens in the comments you can easily accomplish the same by typing the following in the termina:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/icon-size \"24\"\n\nwhere the 24 will be the icon size. You can change this value from 8 to 64 depending on your TV, Monitor or Display. In my case 20 is perfect.\n\nA: Have you tried CONFINITY\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/confity/files/confity_1.0/confity_1.0.deb/download\nI have not tested it but it may work for unity 2D\nAtul Kakrana\n", "Q: Desktop lagging and general problems with an ATI X1550 So recently i installed Ubuntu 11.10 and first thing i always do is checking additional drivers but nothing shows there , and when i go to \"System Info\" > \"Graphic\" there is \"Driver:Unknown Experience:Standard\" , but experience is not even close to standard.

We are having issues in our labs where students set the magnifier and a few other settings intentionally to make the system almost unusable. I was thinking about controlling this activity, but disabling it will not solve that issue because there might be people who really need and this also eliminates the options of disabling it at the screen and enabling it back again through console.\nSo I was really wondering can we attach some kind of authentication to this in anyway, so that a lab admin can give access to the person who needs to use this option. Or even better is there a way to set it or disable it through the command prompt.  Keep in mind I am using Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nA: I guess the main issue here (past all the social nonsense) is one user can affect another. This is a technical situation that Linux has been fairly good at preventing for a fairly long time. The fact this is a problem suggests to me that you're not actually providing these people with their own logins, going for a single-user method.\nThat's a major issue in itself because people using browsers aren't getting the privacy or security they might expect. People can run things in that shared user that log keystokes, monitors browsers, etc. Not good stuff.\nSo break things out. Get a LDAP-style system in place so every user has their own account. Make the computers refresh from a central ISO. User files stored in a central place too. It's hard work but it's infinitely better than what you've got.\nBy this point you're in a situation where no one (non-admin) user can affect another user.\nPast this if people want to muck up their own sessions, you have to explore the behaviour that leads to all this. People are vandalising the lab equipment and you need to address that lack of respect.\nA few suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log common commands that cause issues (easy with a wrapper script). For instance it should be posible to log the start of the accessibility applications to a central server so that you know who is loading it and when they're doing it.\n\n*Charge people to fix deliberate breaks.\n\n*Stick up a couple of cheapy webcams in labs to corroborate logs.\n\n\nYou don't need to get 1984 on your users but they need to know the limits.\n", "Q: How to run application under different user I am using 11.04. I have two users. (User1 and User2). \nCould you please tell if it is possible to run Firefox or any other browser with another User's profile.\nLet say, I am using User2 to access my office network via browser. So while working on User1, I want to access office network and dont want to switch from User1. So will it be possible to change few permissions so as to make firefox open only using User2's profile.\nSo scene would be something like this.\n1) User1 clicks on firefox launcher\n2) OS asks for User2's password\n3) User1 enters User2's password\n4) Firefox is launched with User2's profile. (It loads all configurations from ~/home/user2/.firefox)\n\nA: You could try gksu -u rather than gksudo. 'gksudo' implies the need for an 'administative' password.\n'gksu' is 'switch user' and will ask for User2's password.\n You'll probably run into permissions issues since the displayed desktop belongs to User1.\n\nA: Disclaimer - I am just answering the question of how to make the configuration change you are wanting, not advocating that you do this, I would highly advise you stay with the defaults and use the user password (an not the target password as outlined below). \nIt seems the question has morphed to how to configure sudo / gksu / gksudo to use the second users password.\nThis part of the question is done by configuring sudo.\nsudo visudo\n\nLook for the \"Defaults\" section (there are several Default lines already)\nAdd in a line\nDefaults runaspw\n\nThis will configure sudo to ask for the user password.

How can I figure this one out?\n\nA: It's \"+y, not +y\nThe \"+ prefixes tell vim to use the X11 clipboard instead of vim's internal clipboard. You only need them if you want to exchange text with other programs.\nUsually you can just use y to yank the marked text (if you are in visual mode) or append some move commands to yank a text range, like y2w to yank the next two words.

This question is related to this one.\nI work with animation, which generates a LOT of files (+/- 1,000,000) typically stored on a single directory. On Mac Os X, some bugs came up with more than +/-30,000 files, so I used to break the animation into various directories.\nOn Ubuntu, is there a limit for the number of files a single directory can hold?\n\nA: Ubuntu does not limit the size of a directory, it's imposed by the file system. Each file and directory is an so-called inode. You can use df -i to check the number of inodes in use and available for all mounted filesystems.\nI've just created 1 million and one files without issues because my inode limit for my ext4 home partition of 50 GB (46 GiB) is large enough.\nI used shell expansion for creating the files, combined with the touch utility:\nmkdir test\ncd test\ntouch {0..300000}\ntouch {300000..600000}\ntouch {600000..900000}\ntouch {900000..1000000}\n\nThis creates 1000001 files which can be verified with ls | wc -l. Why 300000..600000 and not 300001..600000? Because I was too lazy to put that 1 at the end.\ndf -i looks like:\n/dev/sda6            3055616 1133635 1921981   38% /home\n\nNow remove the test files (cd ..&&rm -f test took much longer, so use rm with the filenames):\nrm {0..300000}\nrm {300000..600000}\nrm {600000..900000}\nrm {900000..1000000}\ncd ..\nrmdir f\n\nand the number of inodes in use decreased immediately after removal of the files:\n/dev/sda6            3055616  133634 2921982    5% /home\n\nNote that even if the filesystem allows such large numbers of files, it's a horrible idea to store such large files in a single directory.

Thank you for the help.\n\nA: You should install 64-bit. You have a modern 64-bit processor and plenty of RAM. It's no longer the case that the 64-bit version is less stable, and virtually all software is available for both platforms.\nI would say the only reason you should consider installing the 32-bit version is if there's some key piece of software that you need which is only available as a 32-bit version.\n\nA: I would suggest a 32-bit. As it will be installed with PAE kernel, you will not have any probs with 8 Gb RAM usage. I think there are more 32-bit applications, so if you don't have any special requirements for particular applications go for 32-bit Ubuntu !\nGood luck.\n\nA: 64-bit is the best choice for your hardware.\n", "Q: How do I add Update Manager to the Activities/Applications tab within GNOME Shell?

As every system usually has different sets of packages installed, you might save more or less than my 55Mb.\nIn other words, unless space really is an issue, go with fossfreedom's answer.\nCredits to tony from ossramblings.com for the --force-all switch.\n\nA: all ubuntu versions - 64bit users\nCurrently there is no 64bit version of Adobe Reader available in the standard Canonical Partners repository.\nThe Adobe Reader package is actually a 32bit package and thus all the 32bit dependencies will be installed as well.\nYou will need to enable the Canonical Partners repository in Software Sources (search in Dash)\n\nThen in a terminal you can update and install acrobat reader:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install acroread\n\nBe warned - its a 180Mb+ install.\n\nIf 180Mb+ is considered a too sizeable install, then strong consideration should be given to using alternative PDF readers such as evince  or okular \n", "Q: RT2561/RT61 wireless doesn't pick up SSID I just upgraded my parents' computer from an old (9.04) Ubuntu to 11.10.

I wanted to try out using graphical tools over ssh. Just to learn a new thing :)\nso my understanding is this, I connect like this: ssh -port -x user@server\nBut I'm running ubuntu server so it has no gui and thus no gui tools. My understanding is I've to install gedit on server. But also xserver?\nCan someone clear up this concepts to me?\n\nA: The correct command is \nssh -p 2222 -X user@host\n\nwhere I suppose the server listen on 2222 port number. Also note that the case of X option is important, it must be uppercase.\nYou need to have the program you want to run installed on the server (gedit in this case). Also you may install gedit without installing X, just because you can run gedit on a remote X server, as you are trying to do.\n\nA: I think that the question is not about how to use the ssh console command, but some way to use gedit over ssh connections. Well there is a way..\nyou can mount the remote file system in a local directory through sshfs, then you can use gedit to edit those files, or whatever application running in the local machine to edit the files in the local ssh mapping.\n\nA: You don't have to install gedit on your server, but you can use gedit on your desktop to edit file on the server.

But since I wrote this I will post it anyway. If your not up for just \"trying new things\" like the question asked and just want to open a file on a ssh server with gedit. I personally would not do it that way. But sometimes I would like to be able to open a file in gedit when I am logging in to my server over ssh. This is how I ended up here. (and I have not found the answer to that here)\nssh means sftp is also available as well. Modern GNU/linux filemanagers support connecting to sftp server and browse and open and edit files just like they are local (but slower over the net usually)\nI have a login with a public key setup for security and convenience so I can log into my server over ssh and sftp without a password just by clicking a bookmark I made in nautilus:\n\n\n*\n\n*File -> Connect to server\n\n*fill in your ssh/sftp server sftp://user@11.11.11.11/folder\n\n*connect.\n\n*Make Bookmark.\n\n*Double click on files associated with gedit (or anything)\n\n\nSo this is how I do it.

I update my Blender installation often, so it's more convenient not to have to change settings every time.\n\nA: I have had the same problem and it's happened to me twice now. Both times I found this post and tried the suggestion of disabling the key binding and it does not work. However changing does work.

Thats why changing the shortcuts in settings does nothing.\nFor anyone who is searching solution for this problem - i think there is none for now (other than changing it in the ubuntu / unity code). You can only change the shortcut in blender, or you can use in blender shift+alt+rmb instead of alt+rmb, which is generally the same, but stands for add loop to selection (with shift), not select loop.\nYou can check the details about the ubunut bug here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1022743\n\nA: There is bug and it can be disabled. Instead we need to assign it to some less or not used shortcut. So i used Crtl+Shift+Alt+Button2(middle button of mouse). There is no other option than mouse buttons to use.

The list appears to be hard-coded in the source:\nstatic gchar *themes[] = { \"Adwaita\", \"Ambiance\", \"Radiance\", \"HighContrast\",\n    \"HighContrastInverse\" };\n\nThis was added by Ubuntu (in 04_add_theme_selection.patch) to the original gnome 3 gnome-control-center source.  It appears that they did not plan to allow anyone to add 11.10 themes at this time.  Presumably the list will be editable or generated dynamically in future versions of Ubuntu's theme selection patch.\n\nA: If you have root access to /usr/share/themes you could also recycle one of the hardcoded theme names for your experiment, e.g:\nsudo mv /usr/share/themes/Adwaita /usr/share/themes/Adwaita.old\nsudo ln -s /path/to/your/theme /usr/share/themes/Adwaita\n\nObviously your theme will show up as 'Adwaita' in Settings -> Appearance.

Or is there another solution?\n\nA: The psmouse driver is responsible for handling all mice and touchpads that use the PS/2 bus, even though many of them (including most touchpads) support some kind of \"extended\" protocol. Thus, it's normal to see the PS/2 driver loading and then indicating it found an ALPS touchpad, which it handles internally.\nGo look in /lib/modules/3.0.0-16-generic/kernel/drivers/input/mouse and you'll see there is no \"alps\" driver proper, notice too that psmouse.ko is by far the largest driver, since it handles a lot of PS/2 protocol extensions internally (like ALPS, Elantech, some Synaptics, and others). \nThis is just an explanation, I'm sorry I don't have a real solution for you, you may want to go have a look at this bug report to see if it applies to you, and if so, to track the status of any possible solutions.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/550625\n", "Q: Can I add (and show) a user photo(s) in LightDM?

I've done several installations of different Ubuntu versions on my machine one over the other from a CD or live usb, and now I have a mess of swap partitions (something like 10 of them), so I need to eliminate all those and create a new one.\nI also need to know how to tell the system that the new partition is the one for swap -- otherwise the system won't recognize it.\n\nA: You can use Gparted to edit partitions.  Delete the unwanted swap partitions and add a new one.  Try to avoid moving existing partitions, as this operation takes a long time, although in-place resizing is usually pretty fast.  Basically, if the tan part moves, it'll take a while.  And back up everything important first.  \nSwap partitions tend to be recognized automatically, but you can edit /etc/fstab to tell it to use that as a swap.  First right-click on the swap partition and select \"information\", and copy or write down the UUID.  Next edit /etc/fstab:\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\nRemove any lines whose third field is \"swap\" (be conservative; if you're not sure what to do, leave a line alone) and add a new line like this:\nUUID=uuid     none     swap    0     0\n\nReplace those spaces with tabs, and replace the lowercase string \"uuid\" with the UUID you copied or wrote down earlier.\n\nA: Dude, clone ur system in a USB or Portable HD and then, format the device.

I want to use gedit using ssh for file editing on my server. I use nano, but for html and css gedit is better.\nNow with sudo apt-get install gedit I get dependencies that are 120mb, that kind seems too big. \nSo did I just install also a complete user interface because of gedit? I don't need a user interface... What did it also install automatically? Should I've used some other command for installation?\n\nA: You can find what a package depends on using apt-rdepends, install it with Software Center:\n\nOr with terminal:\nsudo apt-get install apt-rdepends\n\nTo check what packages depends gedit on (packages that were installed when you did sudo apt-get install gedit) type this after you installed apt-rdepends\nsudo apt-rdepends gedit\n\nThat will return the list of packages that gedit installed or were already installed and are used by gedit for running.\nIf you want to use gedit there will be a lot of dependencies that you wont be able to avoid but are necessary for the program to run without faults.\n\nA: You most likely did not actually install X11 or anything like that, however, you probably have lots of GTK+ libs and other related junk on your system.  If you change your mind, you can execute the following commands to remove Gedit and its depedencies, without breaking anything else:\nsudo apt-get remove gedit\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThis will remove any packages which apt-get installed automatically and which are no longer needed.\nIf you want to use something better than nano, try using sftp to download the file, edit it in your editor of choice, and then upload it again.

This command will not prompt you at all, and programs which want to block shutdown will most likely be unable to do so.  This will bypass X.  If for some reason this does not work, try adding the \"--force\" option:\nsudo reboot --force\n\nIf you are unable to launch a terminal, you may be able to get to run a command with Alt+F2, but be sure to use \"gksu\" or \"kdesu\" instead of \"sudo\".  If this doesn't work, press Ctrl+Alt+F5 (you can use any F key from F1 through F6), login, and proceed as above (using \"sudo\", not \"gksu\").  If you still cannot reboot the machine, use the magic sysrq key\nIf you don't want to reboot the whole computer, you may be able to fix it by sending a SIGHUP to kdm (or gdm or lightdm), but it sounds as if you already tried that.

I clean-installed Ubuntu 11.10 today, and then installed VirtualBox.  This required me to add myself to the vboxusers group, and since 11.10 seems to no longer have a graphical app to add users to a group, I ran the following command:\nsudo usermod -G vboxusers stephane\n\nThis is a problem.  I now see what I should have run instead is:\nsudo usermod -aG vboxusers stephane\n\nThe end result is I'm no longer in the groups I should be in.  Including whatever group is required to run \"sudo\".  When I run any command as sudo now, I get the following:\n$ sudo ls\n[sudo] password for stephane: \nstephane is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n\nIs there a way to fix this, or do I need to re-install from scratch again?\n\nA: I've tried various combinations after doing the same thing as the remount menu option seems not to be in 12.10. I have tried everything else in this post from root. The last was\numount -a\nmount -o -w /<path> /\n\nThis resulted in the filesystem still being ro due to a setting in fstab to boot ro on filesystem error I think, with it stating it seemed to be ro after mount.\nI finally managed it with\nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nAlthough I am not sure how this is different from the previous set of commands.\nAfter applying this variation, adding a user to the admin (11.10 and ealrier) or sudo (12.04 and later) group is done the same way:\nadduser username admin    # 11.10 and earlier\nadduser username sudo     # 12.04 and later\n\nA: *\n\n*During boot, press and hold the left Shift key, and you should see the GRUB menu.\n\n*Select the entry containing (recovery mode) and wait.\n\n*You should now be presented with a menu. Select:\nremount    Remount / read/write and mount all other file systems \n\nand wait for your file systems to get mounted with read/write permissions, then press Enter.\nIf this option doesn't appear or won't work, you can instead choose the root option and use the following command to mount the system partition:\nmount -o remount /\n\nYou can check out which is your system partition with fsck command or by viewing /etc/mtab.\nAfter successfully running the mount command (i.e. no error messages), proceed directly to step 5 below.\n\n*After choosing the remount option, the menu comes up again. Select:\nroot       Drop to root shell prompt\n\n\n*Now enter one of the following commands to re-add your user to the admin group (for Ubuntu 11.10 and earlier):\nadduser <USERNAME> admin\n\nor to the sudo group (for Ubuntu 12.04 and later):\nadduser <USERNAME> sudo\n\n\n*Reboot and you should be able to use sudo again.\n\nA: Old question but happened to me too (Ubuntu 14.04).\nI was unable to log into recovery mode and gain access to a root shell, as many answers here and elsewhere describe: the root shell access from GRUB seems to be password-protected.\nSo I solved the problem this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot on a live usb stick\n\n*open a shell\n\n*access the main HD Linux filesystem (you can find its mounting point in the address bar of the GUI file explorer, usually after CTRL-L). cd into it.\n\n*edit the file etc/group (say with nano etc/group or anything else)\n\n*find the \"sudo\" line. Should look like sudo:x:27:admin,bob,alice\n\n*add yourself to the sudo line, comma separated\n\n\nOf course, this implies that the file etc/sudoers still holds the line\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nmeaning that all members of the group sudo have total control. First check that.\nWorked uneventfully.\n\nA: If root login is enabled on your system just drop terminal via Control+Alt+F1 without log in to X. Log in as root and then just add the desired user to admin group (for Ubuntu 11.10 and earlier):\nadduser desired_user_name admin\n\nFor Ubuntu 12.04 and later, add the user to the sudo group:\nadduser desired_user_name sudo\n\nIf you did not enable root login just choose recovery mode from Grub and then try root shell.\n \nMount file system as read-write:\nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nAfter that you can again add your desired user to the admin (or sudo) group.\n\nA: I made the same mistake adding my account to a group (forgot the -a). I had my system installed with the root login locked, and my account was the only one on the machine.\nThe accepted answer did not help me. While booting into recovery mode, all I got was an unhelpful message\n\nCannot open access to console, the root account is locked. See \n  sulogin(8) man page for more details\n  Press ENTER to continue\n\nAfter pressing ENTER, the system booted normally: no luck getting root access to fix the problem. I'm leaving this answer in case someone ends up in my shoes by this point. Use the following only if you cannot get to the recovery mode through the Grub menu.\nA walkthrough to get the root shell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the Grub menu, and highlight (but don't press Enter on!) the normal (default, not a recovery!) boot option.\n\n*Press e. Grub will display a command line editor with multiple lines, every one of which may look unfamiliar if not intimidating. Do not worry, any changes you make are not saved permanently.\n\n*Find the line that reads linux ... ro .... This is the kernel command line. Replace the ro token with rw, to make the root filesystem read/write, and add another kernel command line parameter, init=/bin/sh. This instructs the kernel to execute sh instead of /sbin/init. In the end, the line should look like linux ... rw init=/bin/sh .... Note: You can get by even with the bare grub> prompt. I'll be happy to explain how, step by step, if all else fails for you; just leave a comment to this answer.\n\n*After the change, press F10 to use the commands from the editor to boot the system (or read the instructions how to boot right below the editor window, if your Grub is compiled differently). You'll get the root shell prompt, since the init process runs as PID 1 with the root identity.\n\n*Make the change you want to make, for instance usermod -a -Gadm,sudo YOURUSERID. Confirm with id -a YOURUSERID that you've got your sudo membership back. In case you get a \"command not found\" error, use /sbin/usermod and /bin/id.\n\n*You cannot shutdown or reboot the system cleanly at this point. reboot, halt or poweroff won't work, and exit from the shell will lead to a kernel panic, as the PID 1 process is not expected to just exit. So the next two command you must issue are:\nsync\nexec /sbin/init\n\nsync just in case anything goes wrong, to save all changes to disk, and the exec to replace the shell with the real init (which can be systemd, upstart or System V init, but it's always called /sbin/init). The system will most likely continue to boot normally (no recovery mode).\n\n*Login and reboot the system once, e. g. sudo reboot--you should have gotten your sudo privilege back. A reboot is recommended, as (although very rarely) init may be passed additional parameters during a normal boot, and that we did not do. In case the exec fails, simply reset the machine and let it boot normally. All modern journaling filesystems like ext4, xfs and btrfs recover themselves quickly (a few seconds for a journal check at most, if synced before the reset), and you'll be all set.\n\n\n\nA bit of a background\nThere was a discussion on the Debian bug report about this very problem, and, as far as understand, this was decided a feature and not a bug, which I judge to have been rather a mistake. Having been in this business for 25 years, I cannot help but entirely disagree with the Michael Biebl's argument in message #31 in that thread:\n\nConsider this: You have a laptop with a locked root account. By default\n  the grub boot loader generates a boot entry for rescue mode.\n  So, even if you lock down the bios to not allow booting from CD-Rom or\n  USB, and you password protect grub, someone could easily get root access\n  if you leave the laptop unattended for a moment.\n\nThe correct, IMO, if not general enough, objection was given in message #70 by Felipe Sateler:\n\nFor many (most?) computers, physical access means game lost\n  security-wise, as you can just disassemble the box and get the hard\n  drive.\n\nThis is true especially for the laptop, mentioned in the Michael's argument: if you leave it unattended for a moment, and someone is after your data, the laptop will be simply gone to never be seen again. And for any machine, not \"many\" or \"most,\" even those bolted at 8 points into a rack, as soon as the attacker gets physical access to the machine, game is really over.\n", "Q: I can't see in the dash the filter function The dash in Ubuntu 11.10 should display on the right side a filter function which I can't see.

I've seen several references to 'Compiz Config' and a 'gnome config' application that seems to not be installed by default.  Where do these config applications store their data?  Is there a registry similar to Windows or are there just some files that I could edit by hand, if I really, really wanted to?\n\nA: gconf is a rough equivalent, but it's important to understand that Ubuntu and Windows are very different systems.  gconf is a \"registry\" for Gnome, which Ubuntu is now moving away from.  It does not control every aspect of the system.  Much of the lower-level information is in flat text files spread throughout /etc and /usr/share/name-of-app.  User-specific information, including Unity config, is often in dotfiles inside your home directory (that is, files beginning with a \".\", so that they are not listed by default.  Press Ctrl+H in the file browser to show them).\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*gconf is equivalent to the registry for many GUI issues relating to Gnome, but holds little sway over Unity-related things.\n\n*Many lower level configuration settings are in flat text files in /etc and /usr/share/\n\n*Much Unity config is in dotfiles in the home directory.\n\nA: The 3 most common applications you will hear about when talking about tweaking Gnome/Unity will be gconf-editor, dconf-editor and ccsm.\nYou can find those in the Software Center and install them from there. \nThe 2 first tools will configure different (sometimes not so different, think of it as a path that leads to the same goal) aspects of your Gnome configuration and the last one is important to configure your Unity/Compiz configuration. \ngconf-editor stores its data in XML files in /etc/gconf/ \ndconf-editor uses files called key files stored in /etc/dconf/db/\nccsm stores its data in XML  files in your ~/.gconf/apps/compiz and ~/.gconf/apps/compizconfig folders.\nAny of these can be read and edited with a plain text editor (nano, gedit, etc.), but it sure is a lot of work.  Use the appropriate tools to edit those files, and it will make your life much simpler.\n\nA: There is a DBus interface  com.canonical.AppMenu.Registrar  that contains the desktop GUI indicator icons and associated ap interfacing details in the Unity environment as described here .\n", "Q: Unity to Gnome help \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install and use the latest version of GNOME 3?\nHow to revert to GNOME Classic? \n\nim noob in linux, and recently i have installed ubuntu 11.10 but i've always work on gnome environment, \ni really want the gnome environment.\nSomeone knows a reliable method to change unity to gnome \n\nA: If you're going for gnome2 then all you need to do is click on your username at login, at the bottom of the screen you'll see Ubuntu in a drop-box.

Although there are ways to install Gnome 2, I doubt you can achieve good system stability with them, given that Unity runs atop Gnome 3, and Gnome 2 is no longer maintained.  You can install Xfce, however.

Please use the symbols, so i know which one you mean.\n\nA: This was changed to be like this by design. I don't have access to the document listed there which discusses the design, but I'd imagine it's preferable to disable one of the three buttons rather than remove it. This gives a more consistent look across the system.\nThere are a couple bug reports citing this here and here.

In Ubuntu 11.04, classic version, I can import music folder with Rhythmbox from other partitions with no issues.\nAfter upgrading to 11.10 and clicking on Import Folder from Rhythmbox, I can browse to the songs from the other partition but they are all greyed out.  If I browse to that partition with the regular file browser, the songs plays fine.\nIs there a way to allow Rhythmbox to import songs from other partitions in 11.10?\n\nA: Is your partition in NTFS format? If so, you are possible dealing with read-only files. I would guess that Rhythmbox displays them as greyed out because it plans on eventually modifying the metadata of the songs - which is not possible with read-only files.\nMedia players normally only read the file while its playing, but attempt not to write anything to them.\nIf your partition is in NTFS format and consequently not writable, you should download the ntfs-3g package, which allows writing data to ntfs drives and is supposedly better in many other ways than the default ntfs filesystem handler package.\nYou would do so by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nAfter this, a remount of the partition would be enough.\nOtherwise, please report which filesystem does your partition have, which is a critical thing to know before solving this question\n", "Q: Help with my basic partitions download ubuntu, and my partitions became basic to dynamic?\nmy operating system windows 7: died, and I was trying to fix this problem, I have working files need corel draw, and I have much experience in this, as I can see my partitions \"unreadable\"?\nAs I can restore without losing my data\nSorry for my bad English\n\nA: Try to remove the hard drive and hook it up to a running PC.

I already read it from manual but I can't see difference..\nsu - change user ID or become superuser\nsudo -s [command]\n\nThe -s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified in passwd(5).  If a\n                   command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution.  Otherwise, an interactive shell is executed.\nsudo -i disappear description in manual\n\nA: sudo lets you run commands in your own user account with root privileges. su lets you switch user so that you're actually logged in as root. \nsudo -s runs a shell with root privileges. sudo -i also acquires the root user's environment.\nTo see the difference between su and sudo -s, do cd ~ and then pwd after each of them. In the first case, you'll be in root's home directory, because you're root. In the second case, you'll be in your own home directory, because you're yourself with root privileges.\nThere's more discussion of this exact question here.\n\nA: This answer is a dupe of my answer on a dupe of this question, put here on the canonical answer so that people can find it!\nThe major difference between sudo -i and sudo -s is:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo -i gives you the root environment, i.e. your ~/.bashrc is ignored.\n\n*sudo -s gives you the user's environment, so your ~/.bashrc is respected.\n\n\nHere is an example, you can see that I have an application lsl in my ~/.bin/ directory which is accessible via sudo -s but not accessible with sudo -i. Note also that the Bash prompt changes as will with sudo -i but not with sudo -s:\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ ls .bin\nlsl\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ which lsl\n/home/dotancohen/.bin/lsl\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ sudo -i\n\nroot@melancholy:~# which lsl\n\nroot@melancholy:~# exit\nlogout\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ sudo -s\nSourced .bashrc\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ which lsl\n/home/dotancohen/.bin/lsl\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ exit\nexit\n\nThough sudo -s is convenient for giving you the environment that you are familiar with, I recommend the use of sudo -i for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The visual reminder that you are in a 'root' session.\n\n*The root environment is far less likely to be poisoned with malware, such as a rogue line in .bashrc.\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu or a related system, I don't find much use for su in the traditional, super-user sense. sudo handles that case much better. However, su is great for becoming another user in one-off situations where configuring sudoers would be silly.\nFor example, if I'm repairing my system from a live CD/USB, I'll often mount my hard drive and other necessary stuff and chroot into the system. In such a case, my first command is generally:\nsu - myuser  # Note the '-'. It means to act as if that user had just logged in.\n\nThat way, I'm operating not as root, but as my normal user, and I then use sudo as appropriate.\n\nA: The main difference between these commands is in the way they restrict access to their functions.\nsu (which means \"substitute user\" or \"switch user\") - does exactly that, it starts another shell instance with privileges of the target user. To ensure you have the rights to do that, it asks you for the password of the target user. So, to become root, you need to know root password. If there are several users on your machine who need to run commands as root, they all need to know root password - note that it'll be the same password. If you need to revoke admin permissions from one of the users, you need to change root password and tell it only to those people who need to keep access - messy.\nsudo (hmm... what's the mnemonic? Super-User-DO?) is completely different. It uses a config file (/etc/sudoers) which lists which users have rights to specific actions (run commands as root, etc.) When invoked, it asks for the password of the user who started it  - to ensure the person at the terminal is really the same \"joe\" who's listed in /etc/sudoers. To revoke admin privileges from a person, you just need to edit the config file (or remove the user from a group which is listed in that config). This results in much cleaner management of privileges.\nAs a result of this, in many Debian-based systems root user has no password set - i.e. it's not possible to login as root directly.\nAlso, /etc/sudoers allows to specify some additional options - i.e. user X is only able to run program Y etc.\nThe often-used sudo su combination works as follows: first sudo asks you for your password, and, if you're allowed to do so, invokes the next command (su) as a super-user. Because su is invoked by root, it does not require you to enter the target user's password. So, sudo su allows you to open a shell as another user (including root), if you're allowed super-user access by the /etc/sudoers file.\n\nA: *\n\n*su Asks root password, becomes root, opens an interactive non-login shell.\n\n*su - Asks root password, becomes root, opens an interactive login shell.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo -s Asks your passwords, becomes root, opens a interactive non login shell.\n\n*sudo -i Asks your passwords, becomes root, opens a interactive login shell.\n\nBest practice is to use the above two commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo su Asks your password, becomes root momentarily to run su as root.\n\n*sudo su - Asks your password, becomes root momentarily to run su - as root.\n\nSo in this case you are running su using sudo and you don't have to know root's actual password. The results are same as su and su -.\n\nA: su asks for the password of the user \"root\".\nsudo asks for your own password (and also checks if you're allowed to run commands as root, which is configured through /etc/sudoers -- by default all user accounts that belong to the \"admin\" or \"sudo\" groups are allowed to use sudo).\nsudo -s launches a shell as root, but doesn't change your working directory.  sudo -i simulates a login into the root account: your working directory will be /root, and root's .profile etc. will be sourced as if on login.\n", "Q: How can I set default terminal used in Unity?

I have two computers. Computer A is running Ubuntu 11.10 with Gnome Clasic. Computer B is running Mythbuntu 11.10. Computer B has a sweet digital audio sound system.\nI want to play music from Banshee on Computer A, but have the sound output sent over the LAN and come out on computer B's speakers.\nI found this question which indicated I should use something called \"paprefs\" to acheive this. So, I installed paprefs and then in the \"Network Server\" dialog, I selected these settings:\n\nAnd then... I have no idea what is supposed to happen. I checked the paprefs home page, and all they say under Documentation is \"There is not much to say. Just run paprefs and see for yourself.\"\nI don't see anything happening or any way I'm supposed to make the connection from Computer A to Computer B.\nHow is this supposed to work? Can someone provide clear instructions on what one does to actually make the connection?\nIdeally, the hope is that I can have a set up that allows me to always play certain applications, like Banshee, over the LAN using Computer B's sound system. In other words, once set up, it is the default, and does not have to be manually reconnected every time.\n\nA: The least complicated method to send audio from one Pulse Audio server to another over the LAN is to use the RTP/Multicast feature that you are able to set up using paprefs .\nOn the sender:\n\nChoose your local soundcard or choose a separate device you can select as audio output from Audio Preferences.\nOn the receiver:\n\nBy doing so audio will be sent from the sender to the receiver via your LAN.\n\nA: The below example shows how to create a pulseaudio TCP tunnel to forward sound from computer alpha to computer beta.  In my case, both computers are running Ubuntu 14.04.\nOn alpha (the source computer) append the following lines to /etc/pulse/default.pa:\n.fail\nload-module  module-tunnel-sink  sink_name=beta  server=tcp:IP_ADDRESS_OF_BETA:4713\n.nofail\n\n(Choose any unique value for sink_name.  I arbitrarily chose to use the value beta.)\nOn beta (the destination computer) append the following line to /etc/pulse/default.pa:\nload-module  module-native-protocol-tcp  auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1;LAN_NAME\n\nIn the above, LAN_NAME and IP_ADDRESS_OF_BETA will be specific to your computers and your LAN.  For example, they might be:\nLAN_NAME            =  192.168.1.0/24\nIP_ADDRESS_OF_BETA  =  192.168.1.10\n\nAfter making the above changes, restart pulseaudio, first on beta, then on alpha.  The order matters.  I restart pulseaudio with pulseaudio --kill.  I run pulseaudio --kill as my pesonal UID (not as root), as pulseaudio is already running as my personal UID.\nIf everything worked successfully, you should now see the tunnel on the Output Devices tab of pavucontrol on alpha.  When an audio source is playing, you should be able to route the source to the tunnel on the Playback tab of pavucontrol on alpha.\nAs long as the tunnel is intact, you should also be able to see the tunnel on the Playback tab of pavucontrol on beta.  If the tunnel disappears, restart pulseaudio, first on beta, then on alpha.  The tunnel is only created when pulseaudio starts on alpha.\nNote 1: This example assumes pulseaudio is running on both alpha and beta.  As of 2016, pulseaudio runs by default on Ubuntu, and has for years.\nNote 2: This example does not use Avahi Zero-configuration networking.  Avahi may be enabled by default on Ubuntu, but I have disabled Avahi on my systems.  On my LAN, beta (the destination computer) always has the same IP address, and I know that address.\nNote 3: The above auth-ip-acl grants access to any device on the LAN.  Pulseaudio also supports other (more secure) authentication methods.  I use auth-ip-acl to simplify configuration.\nMore information can be found at the following pages:\nhttps://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8621/how-to-set-up-a-pulseaudio-sink\nhttps://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Network/#index2h2\nhttps://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Modules/#index14h3\n", "Q: ssh hangs for ~15 seconds before connecting If I directly connect to Server A, using public key auth from my computer, it takes <0.5 s. But if run the same ssh command from Server B (to connect to Server A) it freezes for about 15 s at the following line : (complete log)\ndebug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0\n\nSince I can ssh normally, I assume it is a configuration issue in Server B.\nAlso, I've tried sshing from B to A, using another account (with password auth). It too hangs at the same line for the same amount. This leads me to believe that it is system ssh config issue, so I'm posting my /etc/ssh/ssh_config as well.\nI ran a diff of my ssh_config vs Server B's. The result gave no dissimilarities.\nBoth Server A and B are running Lucid.\n\nA: Could be a DNS problem.

Make sure everything is set to its default value by commenting out every line with a leading semicolon.\nFinally, it could be related to this bug. The work-around here was to start pulseaudio in system mode, by changing the value of PULSEAUDIO_SYSTEM_START in /etc/default/pulseaudio to 1. This will prevent pulseaudio from loading 'default.pa' in your /etc/pulse folder. If this fixes your problem and you are on a multi-user system so don't want to continue running pulse in system mode, then edit your post with the contents of default.pa. Otherwise, just leave it fixed. I don't really see the problem with running it in system mode on a single-user system.\n\nA: Try this:\nrm -r ~/.pulse\nrm -r ~/.pulse-cookie\nrm -r ~/.config/pulse\n\nThere might be errors reported that files could not be found. That's ok.\nThen we kick pulse and start it again:\nsudo pulseaudio -k\npulseaudio --start\n\nThere, too, errors might be reported like:\nE: [pulseaudio] core-util.c: Home directory not accessible: Keine Berechtigung\nW: [autospawn] lock-autospawn.c: Fehler beim Zugriff auf Autostart-Sperre.\nE: [pulseaudio] main.c: Failed to acquire autospawn lock\n\nBut after a reboot, it worked for me. Pavucontrol is again running fine since then.\n\nA: The solution to this problem was discovered in the course of solving my other problem, with Pulseaudio and Flash.\nFirst I needed to completely purge and reinstall Pulseaudio. One way to do this is to run the command:\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install pulseaudio\n\nThen, after I had a clean start, I discovered there was this odd entry in /etc/pulse/client.conf. It had a line that said:\nautospawn = now\n\nIt seems that now is not a valid option. I have no idea where that option was coming from, as I thought I was starting fresh after reinstalling.\nI changed it to yes, and then commented it out as well anyway.\n; autospawn = yes\n\nRebooted, and then I was able open pavucontrol without errors.\nThe lesson I took from this is that purging an application might not be as complete as one would assume it to be.\n\nA: Open etc/pulse/default.pa and try commenting out all these lines:\n.ifexists module-jackdbus-detect.so\nload-module module-jackdbus-detect\n.endif\n\nRun the steps again and check the log for changes, if possible give use another output.\nIf that does not work remove pulseaudio and reboot.\n\nA: I received this \"Connection to PulseAudio failed\" error when there were different values of the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable.\nThe pulseaudio server was running with one value, and pavucontrol was running with a different value.  Consequently, pavucontrol was looking in the wrong directory for the communication socket created by pulseaudio.\nIn this case, the solution is to make sure both processes have the same value for the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable.\n\nA: I recently had this on an old gentoo computer I was upgrading.  It turns out I had failed to start the dbus service\n# /etc/init.d/dbus start\n# rc-update add dbus default\n\nThis will probably be an unusual cause of that error dialog.\n", "Q: how do I limit the number of open torrents in transmission?

In a lot of applications the tooltips are just plain ugly (White text on black background, way too much contrast) or even unreadable (black or dark blue text (Hyperlinks) on black background). I want to change the background color of the tooltips to some medium gray or even some yellow or something like that, maybe even something semi-transparent. \nHere is a screenshot of Eclipse which displays some source code in a tool tip with black text on black background:\n\nSwitching to a different theme (Something other than Ambiance or Radiance) helps but I like Ambiance and I want to keep it. It's just this darn tooltip color which is absolutely unacceptable.\nI found several solutions for older Ubuntu versions but they no longer work with Unity in Ubuntu 11.10 because I can't find any function to customize the Ambiance or Radiance theme. So how do I do that in the current Ubuntu version?\n\nA: I've adopted a slightly different solution;\nFirst create a new script, eclipse.sh, that starts eclipse, mine look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nGTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/eclipse/gtkrc-2.0-eclipse /usr/share/eclipse/eclipse\n\nThen create the gtkrc file (/usr/share/eclipse/gtkrc-2.0-eclipse), mine look like this (it have some other changes as well to make better use of the screen):\nstyle \"my-tooltips\"\n{\n  bg[NORMAL] = \"#FFFFAF\"\n  fg[NORMAL] = \"#000000\"\n}\nwidget \"gtk-tooltip*\" style \"my-tooltips\"\n\nstyle \"gtkcompact\" \n{\n    font_name=\"Ubuntu Light 11\"\n\n    GtkButton::default_border={0,0,0,0}\n    GtkButton::default_outside_border={0,0,0,0}\n    GtkButtonBox::child_min_width=0\n    GtkButtonBox::child_min_heigth=0\n    GtkButtonBox::child_internal_pad_x=4\n    GtkButtonBox::child_internal_pad_y=4\n    GtkMenu::vertical-padding=1\n    GtkMenuBar::internal_padding=0\n    GtkMenuItem::horizontal_padding=4\n    GtkToolbar::internal-padding=1\n    GtkToolbar::space-size=1\n    GtkOptionMenu::indicator_size=0\n    GtkOptionMenu::indicator_spacing=0\n    GtkPaned::handle_size=4\n    GtkRange::trough_border=0\n    GtkRange::stepper_spacing=0\n    GtkScale::value_spacing=0\n    GtkScrolledWindow::scrollbar_spacing=0\n    GtkExpander::expander_size=10\n    GtkExpander::expander_spacing=0\n    GtkTreeView::vertical-separator=0\n    GtkTreeView::horizontal-separator=0\n    GtkTreeView::expander-size=10\n    GtkTreeView::fixed-height-mode=TRUE\n    GtkWidget::focus_padding=0\n    GtkTreeView::vertical-separator = 0\n}\n\nclass \"GtkWidget\" style \"gtkcompact\"\n\nstyle \"gtkcompactextra\" \n{\n    xthickness=0\n    ythickness=0\n}\n\nclass \"GtkButton\"   style \"gtkcompactextra\"\nclass \"GtkToolbar\"  style \"gtkcompactextra\"\nclass \"GtkPaned\"    style \"gtkcompactextra\"\nclass \"GtkNotebook\" style \"gtkcompact\"\n\n\nA: For CDT do the following:\nWindow>Preferences>C/C++>Editor: Appearance Color Options>Source Hover Background\nUncheck System Default, and select a color.\nUnfortunately there's no Eclipse-wide setting that I know of.

In my case, it seems that Eclipse is using settings fot tooltips from gtk-2.0/gtkrc file from theme directory.\nMy setup: Ubuntu 12.04, Gnome (Not Unitiy), Eclipse Indigo (3.7), GrayDay theme for Gnome. The name of theme and theme itself is not importat. \nOpen the terminal, change to the theme directory (cd $HOME/.themes) and there, go to the directory of your theme. If your .themes direcotry if empty of it doesn't exist, then, you are using system theme which is in  /usr/share/themes. Just figure out the name of the theme you are using (right click on bakcground, choose Change Desktop Background, the theme name should be in the lower right corner. If it says nothing about theme name, then use gnome-tweak-tool to find out which theme you are using). \nIn the theme directory, issue this command:\ngrep -r tooltip *\n\nit should list all of the files and lines where keywork \"tooltip\" is mentioned. Change every background (tooltip_bg_color) to #ffffff and every foreground to #000000. Black latters on white foreground, this is what we want!

Check the boxes for Foreground and Background and choose colors.\nHow it works (you can do this manually):\ngnome-color-chooser adds the following to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0:\ninclude \".gtkrc-2.0-gnome-color-chooser\"\n\nand ~/.gtkrc-2.0-gnome-chooser:\nstyle \"gnome-color-chooser-tooltips\"\n{\n  bg[NORMAL] = \"#FFFFAF\"\n  fg[NORMAL] = \"#000000\"\n}\nwidget \"gtk-tooltip*\" style \"gnome-color-chooser-tooltips\"\n\nIf you just want to change the tooltip colors for a single app, such as eclipse, then put the above text into a custom gtkrc file (e.g. ~/gtkrc-eclipse) and start eclipse with GTK2_RC_FILES=~/gtkrc-eclipse eclipse\n\nA: I was having same problem (Xubuntu 12.04, Greybird theme, Eclipse Indigo) and Mihael K's answer worked for me.\nThe only file I changed was gtk-2.0/gtkrc and I only changed one line. \nThe third line after the initial comments. Changed the hex color values of tooltip_bg_color:#000000 to tooltip_bg_color:#ffffe1 and tooltip_fg_color:#ffffff to tooltip_fg_color:#000000. So the line will look like this:\ngtk_color_scheme        = \"tooltip_bg_color:#ffffe1\\ntooltip_fg_color:#000000\" # Tooltips.\n\nRestarted elipse and tooltips are now the yellowish color I'm accustomed to. I didn't need to do any further tweaks in eclipse or any of the other files.\n\nA: I created a small script that does that for you\n#/bin/sh\n# Tooltip fix\n# A script to fix themes files in Ubuntu 11.10\n#  to have readable tooltips in applications such\n#  as eclipse.\n# The script edits the gtk.css, settings.ini and gtkrc files\n# Author: Victor Pillac\n# http://victorpillac.wordpress.com\n\nif [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then\n  echo \"This script must be run as root\" 1>&2\n  exit 1\nfi  \n\npath=/usr/share/themes\ntheme=Ambiance\n\nif [ $# = 1 ]; then\n  theme=$1\nfi\n\necho \"Fixing tooltips for theme $theme\"\necho \" (you can select a different theme by passing its name as argument)\"\nsed -i 's/tooltip_bg_color #000000/tooltip_bg_color #f5f5b5/g' $path/$theme/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\nsed -i 's/tooltip_fg_color #ffffff/tooltip_fg_color #000000/g' $path/$theme/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\nsed -i 's/tooltip_bg_color:#000000/tooltip_bg_color:#f5f5b5/g' $path/$theme/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\nsed -i 's/tooltip_fg_color:#ffffff/tooltip_fg_color:#000000/g' $path/$theme/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\nsed -i 's/tooltip_bg_color:#000000/tooltip_bg_color:#f5f5b5/g' $path/$theme/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\nsed -i 's/tooltip_fg_color:#ffffff/tooltip_fg_color:#000000/g' $path/$theme/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\necho \"Done\"\n\n\nA: Install and open gnome-color-chooser .\nGo to Specific → Tooltips and put black foreground over pale yellow background.\n\nA: Found it!\nI had to edit these files:\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\n(Addition: for Ubuntu 12.04, it seems youjust have to modify the file:\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc , replacing the tooltip backround and foreground color, with the #000000 and the #f5f5b5 color, respectively) \nYou require root privileges to edit the files. Use gksudo gedit to edit them.\nSearch for tooltip in these files and you'll find the color definitions for the foreground and the background. I use #000000 as foreground and #f5f5b5 as background and now the tooltips in all applications are again readable. After changing the color values simply switch to some other theme and then back to Ambiance and the tooltip color is now fixed.\nHere is the result:\n\n\nA: On ubuntu 12.10 (quantal) you can use the following two commands:\n#foreground white => black\nsudo sed -i s/tooltip_fg_color:#ffffff/tooltip_fg_color:#000000/g  /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n#background black => yellow\nsudo sed -i s/tooltip_bg_color:#000000/tooltip_bg_color:#f5f5b5/g  /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\n(Thanks to the other answers that helped me to figure this out!!)\n\nA: A more user-friendly way to change the background is using the UI. Open System, Preferences, Appearance. By default \"Ambiance\" theme will be selected, but you can change it for any theme. Click on Customize button below and switch to Colors tab. There you can change foreground and background colors for tooltips by clicking on appropriate boxes.\n\nA: This answer is to point out a rare case where a very similar bug occurs if you have installed xulrunner and configured eclipse to use it.\nI installed xulrunner to make the GPE Designer to properly render GWT UIs in the design mode, which worked very well but I found it also broke the tooltips. The bug is actually worse than the screenshot above, it just display a blank tooltip.\nTo fix it you only have to remove the xulrunner parameter from eclipse.ini:\n-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=/path/to/xulrunner/\n\nIt worked for me with Ubuntu 12.04, Eclipse 4.2/Juno and xulrunner 1.9.2\n\nA: For elementary users:\nGo to /usr/share/themes/elementary/gtk-3.0, edit the file gtk-widgets.css with sudo nano, type Ctrl + W to find Tooltips, and then at the background-color: alpha(#color, #opacity) change the color to something like #f5f5b5 and set opacity to 1.\n\nA: To open Appearance window with Tab: Themes direct from root@ terminal write (you can use this command also for script):\nsudo -u USER gnome-appearance-properties -p theme\n\nwhere USER is your current user on the desktop.

When you boot the computer, and before reaching grub screen you should see messages reporting the ram, hard drive, etc detected. If the ram detected is wrong there, then the problem is in the bios, not ubuntu.\nI had this problem before. Sometimes removing and installing the ram again from the mother board solves it.

Where is all this stuff?\n\nA: Welcome to the new no-user-serviceable-parts-inside Ubuntu/Gnome.\nInstall gnome-tweak-tool (sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool) and run it (it's called \"Advanced Settings\"). The font settings are in the Fonts tab.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the font DPI settings?\n\nA: The easy answer is \"apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\", but that has the downside of pulling in gnome-shell and lots of associated packages.\nYou can do it on the command line using gsettings.

I know there is a lot of documentation about Grub and grub2 here and around the internet, but nothing seems to solve my problem.\nI upgrade from ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 during its beta stage, and everything was working great! But suddenly LightDM started acting up, when I would type my password to log in the screen would flash and bring me straight back to LightDM.\nThen one day I booted to a message similar to \"GNU grub version 1.99 ubuntu. Minimal BASH-like editing is supported. Type help for complete list.\"\nI reasoned I messed things up, thus I took a live CD to simply copy all my files to an external hard drive so I could reinstall Ubuntu. But when I go to my home folder the only folder there is a folder called boot/grub/etc.\nHow can I get all my data back? Thats  all I'm concerned about, not so much about reviving Ubuntu, I will simply reinstall it. \nThank you!\n\nA: When you boot a live session, open the file manager, look in File system. You want to find / and then \"media\". In that folder, you'll find one or more folders. One of them will be your installed root directory wherein you should find \"home\", which contains your files. \nWhat is important to remember, is that you'll have two almost identical file systems in the live session; the file system of the live session itself, and the file system that's stored on disk. It's the one that's stored on disk you're after and it is located in /media/something. \n\nA: When you are booting from a live CD, it essentially means that the operating system (and hence all content within) is on the live CD itself. Perhaps the home folder you are trying to view is on the CD. You have to mount the disk on which your old Ubuntu installation lives and browse the home folder there.\nAnother problem might be that while installing Ubuntu, you somehow chose to encrypt the home folder. In that case you probably will not be able to see the contents of home folder of your previous installation unless you're logged into it, which you cannot because you messed grub up. I don't know what you could do in that situation.\n", "Q: Any way to exclude accounts from mail indicator?

The disablement is already effective in\n  natty.\n== Why removing it? ==\nWe saw a lot of side effects during the previous cycles when we\n  started to use multiples session (like in UNE, desktop session and\n  such):\n  - the saved applications contains the list of all running application, including the window manager, the panel and suchâ€¦ Consequently, we\n  got a lot of patches and hack to avoid saving mutter, compiz,\n  metacity, and the panels in lucid and maverick, so that when someone\n  wanted to start a session, the required components from the session\n  will indeed been launched instead of the saved one.\n  - We tried last week to change the desktop order but it went quite wrong with a lot of settings and we had to revert it.\n  - In addition to that, session saving never really worked with all the default applications we have (for instance, openoffice, firefoxâ€¦)\n  and even with supported applications like gedit: the opened documents\n  weren't started again, making the feature quite useless.\n\nThe information above was derived from this source (visit this link for the full details): http://www.linux-archive.org/ubuntu-desktop/478109-gnome-session-saving-dropped-natty.html\n\nMaybe you could suspend your computer instead of logging out?

I've just created an account to submit an application to the Ubuntu Software Centre and the agreement says: \"You are responsible for determining applicable taxes in connection with distributing your App, and you shall pay applicable taxes to the applicable tax authorities.\".\nDoes this mean that Canonical doesn't collect tax (especially VAT in the EU) and it's my responsibility to do it? \nAlso, am I wrong to assume that the price listed by the USC is the same for both people who pay taxes and for those who don't need to pay them?\n\nA: Hopefully I can clarify the intent of the contract.\nI believe there are two different taxes referred to in your question. There is VAT on the sale to the consumer; and income tax on the payment made to the developer. I'll cover them separately below:\nCanoncial will collect UK VAT (currently 20%) from each sale and pay this to HMRC (the UK's tax authority). The sale price that the developer sets should be inclusive of this tax. VAT is not applicable on sales outside of the EU, but to keep the pricing simple and straightforward for the consumer, the one price has been set for both EU and non-EU customers. This means that the developer's margin will be larger for non-EU customers. The royalty statement sent to each developer will outline the EU versus Non-EU sales and detail any VAT deductions. This is covered in clause 4.2 of the developer agreement.\nClause 3.3, which says \n\n\"You are responsible for determining applicable taxes in connection with distributing your App, and you shall pay applicable taxes to the applicable tax authorities\"\n\nrefers to the income tax that is payable by the developer to the tax authorities where they are a tax resident. This means that the developer needs to declare their income (the net payment made by Canonical to the developer) and pay the applicable income tax in their own country. \nI hope this provides some further clarity, but if there's any other questions please let me know.\n\nA: I think it means that you should declare your income in accordance with the law of your contry. And pay all applicable taxes, such as Tax on income of an individual.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu Software Center add support for generating dynamic license keys? It looks like the Ubuntu Software Centre can only work with static license keys. Will it also support dynamic license keys based order details (name, date, email, etc)?\n\nA: The situation here is that some applications use user-details to create the license making it unique. For example, you might use the customers e-mail address as an input to the hash.\nWe've been asked for this feature a number of times so we're certainly aware of the need. However, each developer uses a different process to generate their licenses. Consequently, we'd either need to provide a system within Ubuntu (ie a library) or some sort of API integration within the Apps portal. Either of these would be complex undertakings.\nSo, for the moment it's going to be static licenses and we'll probably concentrate on mechanisms like e-mail notification.\n", "Q: What video driver should I install for Nvidia Corporation G96 [GeForce 9400 GT]?

Unfortunately, this upgrade overwrote a previous configuration file for my monitor, resulting in the \"out of range\" error on the monitor. (It is an old lcd screen and I need 800x600_60.0hz.) I plugged in an old CRT monitor to work on it. Not having a backup of the configuration file, I researched again how to do it. Involved xrandr and creating a new configuration. I tested this and it worked, so I wrote these settings to a xorg.conf file in /etc/X11/ and rebooted. Boot started, then the screen went blank, no sync. I don't know if the boot continued or got stuck, as the screen is blank.\nSo, figuring it is a faulty xorg.conf, I rebooted to recovery mode and tried to delete or edit the file. I cannot edit it - file system is read only. I cannot delete it - file system is read only. I cannot change the permissions with chmod - file system is read only.

Your general user account won't be able to touch those files normally.\nIf a filesystem is being mounted readonly, that usually means there is some problem with it.  You can try remounting it as read/write to see what errors (if any) appear:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1\n\n/dev/sda1 is the first partition on the first hard drive - you would need to change that if your /etc lives on a different partition or hard drive.\nIf that gives you errors, add them to your question to help with troubleshooting.

I have this on the command line:\nln -sf $PWD/wine-\n\nand then I hit Tab to complete the filename.

The cdable_vars option works on cd only; direxpand expands the variable.\nWhat worked best for me was:\nshopt -u progcomp\n\nIt worked on other commands, besides cd, preserving the variables instead of expanding them.\n\nA: shopt -u progcomp\n\nThis fixed it for me, it also removed a lot of \"intelligent\" completion options which I have found get in the way by not completing files that I know are there because the stupid thing thinks I don't want them as arguments to a particular command.

If not, you can usually \"Browse\" to the executable file of the app you want to use, usually located at /usr/bin.

I had a Compose Key set to right Super (a.k.a. Windows) key using Gnome keybindings. After upgrading, I seem to have lost the Compose Key function. Where can I enable Compose Key? I can't find any option under System Settings > Keyboard.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 21.10 and later, a compose key option has returned to System Settings. In Settings navigate to the Keyboard section in the left column, then, under the Special Characters section, select Compose Key. Turn off the Default Layout, and select which key you would like to use.\nIn addition, the method just below (i.e., the 18.04 through 21.04 way) still works, save that the gnome-tweak-tool package is now called gnome-tweaks (because why not). So use this command instead to install it:\nsudo apt install gnome-tweaks\n\n\nIn Ubuntu 18.04 through Ubuntu 21.04, since Ubuntu has now adopted the GNOME Desktop, things are more complicated: there is no longer any way to set the compose key within the regular system settings.\nYou must first download an entirely separate program, GNOME Tweaks. This can be found in Ubuntu Software or can be downloaded with this command via a terminal:\nsudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nOnce Tweaks is installed, run it. Then hit Keyboard & Mouse on the left. In the Keyboard section on the right, an option to enable the compose key can be found. By default it is not enabled, so you will need to click on the word Disabled (confusingly, the word does not look clickable, but it is), which will open another window. Toggle the switch in the top left of that new window's title bar to enable setting the key.\n\nNote that there are still limited options for what key can be set: Scroll Lock, Right Alt, Caps Lock, PrtScn, Right Ctrl, Left Alt, Menu, and Right Super.\nIf you wish to set it to a key not listed, the solution in this answer still works.\n\nIn Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 go to Keyboard within System Settings. Select the Shortcuts tab, then Typing from the list on the left. Clicking to the right of the Compose Key setting will bring up a menu of different options.\nNote that the only options are Right Alt, Right Ctrl, Right Win, Left Alt, Menu, and Caps Lock. If you wish to set it to a key not listed, see this answer.\n\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 and earlier, go to Keyboard Layout in System Settings, then hit the Options button on the lower right. You will see one option called Compose key position, where you can set it to Right Win (i.e. right Super).\n\nA: In Ubuntu 13.10\nIn Keyboard settings window, under Shortcuts -> Typing set Compose key to Right Alt (or other).\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 19.10, and likely anything using gnome-tweaks (the current name for gnome-tweak-tool), the UI for enabling the compose key is a little confusing.  First, under Keyboard & Mouse, click the \"Disabled\" button:\n\nThen this is where the UI is tricky (and utterly indefensible IMHO).  Click the switch widget in the top left of the new window:\n\nOnce you do that, it'll let you actually change the setting.\n\nA: In Ubuntu MATE 18.04 go to Control Center → Keyboard → Layouts → Options → Position of Compose key and select your choice for the key.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select System Settings... from system menu;\n\n\n*Select Keyboard;\n\n\n*Under the tab labelled Typing click Layout Settings;\n\n\n*In keyboard layout window, click Options... button;\n\n\n*Finally in the Keyboard Layout Options window select Key(s) to change layout and mark the binding of your choice.

The difference is this:\nIn 11.04 Compiz visual effects such as wobbly windows clashed with the Unity interface and removed the top panel with the app-indicators.\nIn 11.10 the Compiz window and compositing manager is better integrated with Unity. You can now enable wobbly windows. I know. I have done so just this week. I cannot speak for any other of the effects. But you specifically mention wobbly windows.\nWhat do you mean by \"oneiric?\" It can mean: 11.10 + Unity 3D or 11.10 + Unity 2D or 11.10 + Gnome shell or even 11.10 + Gnome shell fall back mode (no special effects). With questions like your one a person needs to give more information about their set up.

I'm new to Ubuntu and I'm trying to install it on my boyfriend's laptop. But it's been more than two hours since I've started the installation and now I'm stuck on \"Configuration du système de destination\" (don't know what it is in english... I'm installing the french version).\nWhat can I do? Should I reboot the computer?\n\nA: When I recently installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my desktop, it took a long time too because I had selected to download and install updates during initial install.  For what it's worth, my install was 3+ hours long and I have a fairly quick cable modem connection.\n\nShould I reboot the computer?\n\nNo, just let it sit for a while and it should come back.\nIf you're interested, you can use CTRL-ALT-F1 to get to a text console and tail the install log to see if it is stuck at some step.\nIf it does get powered off, you should be able to re-start the installation and it should be fine.  If you do restart, don't select the updates option - it should go much faster since it will only use the DVD install media files.\n\nA: My Acer Aspire took 6 hours the first time (both my desktop and netbook) but my HP laptop only took an hour. I've found (my opinion) that the fastest and most stable way to install 11.10 is to install without an Internet connection and then run the update manager afterwards. So far this has been the only way to get a stable installation on my particular system.\n\nA: TIMING issue resolution for complete install and first run of Ubuntu 11.10\nTime to completion: Live media - around 2 hours and WEB@DSL - around 1.25 hours.\nLive Media \nNot longer than 1.5 hours. If your install goes past this time, consider the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disc Media is bad. Burn a fresh copy after downloading ISO of the latest stable version from ubuntu.com.\n\n*Hardware issue:\nToo little RAM, Overheating CPU, HDD < 2 GB [really?], busted USB, or BUSTED media read device. Diag, Fix or Replace the busted module, [or call your PC TECH if you don't feel you can fix the problem safely on your own] \n\n\n\nWUBI \nIf you experience a freeze or real slow install time > 1 hour, cancel install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your network, confirm the computer you're prepping for WUBI is attached to the network. \n\n\nReboot computer, start your Windows task manager, click on the networking tab, run WUBI again [uninstall will happen then you can re choose your install config] on 54 MBPS with Network usage no less than 3% total time to first run will be 1 hour.\n\nA: Checking the installation media can be a good idea, or download it with Transmission bit torrent as it checks the the iso file (unlike http or ftp that can fail without any feedback!)\nThe other problem is if you use the option to download updates while installing. That can be a very bad idea as I can testify:\nI have tried to install Xubuntu several times and it took an all night doing nothing apparently but blinking the disk light. This was on a slow Toshiba NB305 with only 1GB of RAM. Normally when I install Linux on more able machines it takes about 15 to 30 minutes to install even activating the updates during install.\nI started to install the latest regular release, 17.10.1, Artful Aardvark, and the live usb disk started quickly enough. Then I started installation on hard disk. I was selecting Transfer updates, and Install Third Party Software, but could never end the installation. I also tried latest Linux Mint with similar problem.\nThis last time I tried to install Xubuntu but not selecting to transfer updates. After that box, it took 4 minutes to continue (just the hour glass and no information of what is going wrong). I checked memory usage and it was still high at 650MB (and went up to 860MB during installation). Eventually I got to choose the rest of the options and from then on it was quick.\nAs always when reinstalling (and even when installing fresh) I avoided the useless option of deleting the disk and so I configured mount points properly myself. All went as normal.\nTotal install time went down from 10 hours and no result to 1 hour and success! After install, I went to the command line and typed:\nsudo su\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n\nThat took another 30 minutes.\nConclusion: Avoid the use of the update option. It doesn't work properly because after a fresh install with updates the system must be updated anyway!\nThis time it took minutes to install plus minutes to update after installation.\n", "Q: Can't login into GNOME Shell, running it always shows fallback mode EDIT: I'm running VMware 7.1 currently.\n\nI'm having major issues getting GNOME3 working on Ubuntu 11.10.

Any help that you could offer would be appreciated.  Thanks.\nFor the record I've created ~/.themes and placed a theme in there per the instructions listed at http://gnome-shell.deviantart.com/gallery/28081982#/d47vmgg.\n\nA: Gnome Shell requires that you have good hardware support from your VGA, and that you have good drivers. Your desktop is a fallback mode for hardware that can't handle Gnome Shell. If you want a modern desktop, you should probably give Unity 2D a chance. It's quite nice and works without 3D acceleration. \n", "Q: Ethernet-WiFi bridging with 11.04 I'd like to set up a bridge between a wireless subnet and an Ethernet subnet (actually just one client, a DVD player with absurdly poor wireless).  That is, the wireless network is the \"real\" network, to which clients get to the router and gateway, and I want the wired subnet to transparently get through the bridge machine to the wireless subnet. (I'm not a networking person so I don't know whether I'm saying that right.) There are two packages I can find that I think are relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*bridge-utils\n\n*parprouted\nI'm not sure which of those I need, or if I need both. (I guess I can just install them and see if it's obvious.)\nIs this an easy thing to set up?  It just occurred to me today that it must be possible, but I haven't found any (recent, at least) how-to's on the subject.\nedit — oh durr I just found this reference which tells me a lot about the bridge-utils stuff (and the deal with the AP not wanting to handle alien-looking packets makes sense).  So maybe that second thing is what I want.\n\nA: So you want something like this?\n+------------+             +---------------+            +--------+     Rest\n| DVD player |<-- wired -->| Ubuntu Bridge |<-- wifi -->| Router |<--> of the\n+------------+             +---------------+            +--------+     network\n\nYou can do this easily with Firestarter. On your Ubuntu machine, install firestarter:\nsudo apt-get install firestarter\n\nWhen you first launch firestarter, it will step you through the wizard. It will ask for your internet-connected interface. Choose \"wireless device (wlan0)\" and check \"IP address assigned via DHCP\" if your router is using DHCP. DHCP is short for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, which is the method used to assign IP addresses to clients on the network. In most cases, this is the default, especially in residential routers.\nIn the next screen, check \"Enable internet connection sharing\". Your local area network device should be your Ethernet device (eth0). What this will do is \"bridge\", or more precisely, perform Network Address Translation between your two network interfaces. Any devices connected to the wired interface will be automatically assigned an IP address, through DHCP, from your wireless router. It's all transparent from the DVD player's perspective.\nThis takes care of the software side of things. But you're not done yet.\nHow does your DVD player connect to your Ubuntu machine? A direct connection with an Ethernet cable may or may not work. The reason lies in the fact that network cables are actually bundles of 8 smaller strands. The order in which they are arranged at the plastic plug (the 'jack') is important. A simple Ethernet cable is 'straight-through', meaning the order of the 8 strands is the same on both ends. For a direct connection where there is a client on each end of the cable, a 'cross-over' cable is required. From the name, you would be right in thinking that the 8 strands will appear to be crossed-over when compared end-to-end. \nSo in your case, if you have a switch or hub in between your DVD player and Ubuntu machine, you can use a straight-through (normal) Ethernet cable. If it is a direct connection, you'll need to use a cross-over Ethernet cable.[1] A good analogy is if you're talking to me directly, you have to put your mouth to my ear so I can hear you (cross over). If we are talking on the phone, then we don't do anything special because the telephone system does the \"crossing-over\" for us. In essence, the telephone system acts as the router.\nOnce you've sorted that out, that's it! Your DVD player should be automatically assigned an IP address by your router and it will be accessible to/from other computers on the wireless network. Note that this arrangement is technically not a subnet bridge; everything is on the same subnet. Unless you specifically want two separate subnets (i.e. 192.168.1.x addresses for the first subnet, and 192.168.2.x addresses for the second subnet), this is the way to go.\n[1] Some network devices are smart and they automatically \"cross-over\" when needed. In this case, any cable will do and it Just Works.\n\nA: You can easily create bridges using this tool:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bridger/\n", "Q: gedit-r-plugin not showing up in plugin list in gedit I installed the gedit-r-plugin through synaptic and in the past it has worked great.

The latest xorg update was a big regression for me on a dual display setup.\nIs there a simple way to revert to the previous version?\nI'm on Lucid Lynx. \n\nA: *\n\n*Please write a comprehensive bug report against the xorg package on launchpad. Updates should never break things. If it happens, it's important to notify developers, so they can fix it. (Even if you suspect they will not fix it because it may be an edge case, I does not harm to report the bug.)\n\n*Apt does not support reverting an action once completed. And Ubuntu/Apt does not (officially) support downgrades.\n\n*Ubuntu can get packages (updates) from different repositories. In synaptic (or other apt front ends), you will see that different version of xorg related packages from different repositories are available. Using the \"Package\" -> \"Force Version\" menu, you can request the downgrade. (The original verison that shipped with lucid comes from the repository \"lucid\" given in parentheses. The offending upgrade probably came from lucid-updates.)\n\n*Downgrading one xorg related package will trigger downgrades of several other xorg related packages. It may take some tries before synaptic gets it right.\nTL;DR: Use Synaptic to downgrade xserver-xorg-core to the version from lucid. Solve potential dependency problems until all xorg related packages are downgraded.\n\nA: \nIs there a simple way to revert to the previous version?\n\nNo - you need to know what to downgrade and what version to pick.\nDowngrading/forcing version links\nThe Ubuntu Community Documentation has Downgrade Howto: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DowngradeHowto\nFrom the Kubuntu Forums (How to downgrade packages (forcing version)):\n\n\n*\n\n*http://kubuntuforums.net/forums/index.php?topic=3117253.0\n\nA: Many times I have done an upgrade to find certain packages broken.

My PC does not have enough resources to run two accounts in Unity 3D.\nWhen I open a guest account from an already started session, it uses Unity 3D by default. How do I change that?\n\nA: It is an interesting question. I've had a look at this, and it seems to be a bug somewhere. In my opinion, you should've been able to add a file called .dmrc to /etc/guest-session/skel containing \n\n[Desktop]\nSession=sessionname\n\nWhere sessionname can be something like \"ubuntu\", \"ubuntu-2d\", \"gnome\", etc. But this doesn't work no matter what I've tried. There are several bug reports about similar issues, so this will be looked into. \nI did come up with a solution for you, however, but it's really hacky and just hides the problem without fixing it. But it does work. Open a terminal and paste the following commands: (Make sure you get the whole commands, otherwise you'll get into trouble)\n\nsudo mv /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/ubuntu.session /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/ubuntu-3d.session\nsudo mv /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/ubuntu-2d.session /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/ubuntu.session\n\nThis just swaps the two sessions, so any user who has chosen to use Unity and not Unity 2D will also be logged in with Unity 2D until he/she chooses differently again.

What's happening?  \nThis worked to me before but I have to reinstall my Ubuntu (in local) and now gnome-terminal doesn't close itself when SSH session ends.\n\nA: Add this to your remote server's ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile, whichever is appropriate:\nalias reboot='{ sleep 2; reboot; }& exit'\nEvery time you type 'reboot' on the remote server, it tells the computer to reboot in 2 seconds, while immediately exiting, ensuring your terminal won't just hang.\nEdit:  have I misunderstood your question?\nTo close your terminal, after a SSH session ends, use an alias for sshing your server, and append 'exit' to the end:\nalias server_ssh='ssh user@site.com; exit'\nPut that in your ~/.bashrc\n\nA: The ssh server dies without properly closing the connection. The client will sit there because it doesn't know anything has happened to the server. The server has just remained quiet for a while; this is indistinguishable from the server being there but having nothing to say.

Is there a way to block a specific folder's files from showing up in the Unity search?\n\nA: When you use files and folders, your activity is logged by a service called Zeitgeist. Unity uses the data from Zeitgeist in its search results. \nBecause Zeitgeist and Unity are separate services, Zeitgeist shouldn't be affected by updates to Unity. \nAs far as I'm aware, the Activity Log Manager is the only easy way to manage what Zeitgeist logs. I know you're worried about the Zeitgeist Activity Log Manager not being 'native', but as far as I can tell, it is. It's maintained by Zeitgeist's developers and is going to be included in Ubuntu Precise; I think the only reason it isn't included in Oneiric is because it was released too late. \nAs you might have seen from the OMG Ubuntu article Gonzo linked to, there's a PPA, so keeping Zeitgeist and the Activity Log Manager up to date really isn't anything to worry about. I installed Activity Log Manager on my Oneiric netbook months ago, and it's working perfectly since then.\nHere's what you need to do to:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:zeitgeist/ppa \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install activity-log-manager\n\nYou can then launch it by searching for it in Unity. Once it's loaded, you'll find the option to prevent certain folders being logged in the Files tab. \nWhen you use these files they won't be logged by Zeitgeist any more, but if you've used any of the files before they'll still show up in Unity's search results. To stop this, you'll need to delete Zeitgeist's record of them. The best way to do this would be to use \"Activity Journal\", which you might need to install first. Just search for it in the Ubuntu Software Centre or run: \nsudo apt-get install gnome-activity-journal\n\nFire it up, and you'll see your computer usage is sorted chronologically. Flick through until you find when you last used those files, right click on a file and click \"Delete all items with this URL\"; Zeitgeist will forget you ever used that file. \nThe Activity Journal is included in the default Ubuntu repositories, so if you really don't want to add the PPA and install the Activity Log Manager, you could install it and use it to manually delete Zeitgeist's records each time you use your files. This wouldn't be very convenient, though. \nEDIT: I originally said the the Activity Log Manager was an official GNOME project - as you'll see from Manish's comment, it turns out not to be. I've changed my wording to \"maintained by Zeitgeist's developers\". \n\nA: Try this utility http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/05/activity-log-manager-for-zeitgeist-lets-you-blacklist-files-and-apps-delete-your-history-more/\n", "Q: Unity \"Dash Home\" icon completely missing In 11.10 the icon for the \"dash home\" button is missing, the generic question mark icon shows.\nHow do I fix this?

I've been trying to find an alternative to Banshee, and right now, I'm using Clementine. It really is a great music player, but it just has too many features for me. All I listen to are soundtracks from movies and games and such, so all of the extra radio, podcast, lyric finding, etc. stuff is useless. \nI've seen that Audacious is an extremely light and fast music player that seems to be simple. I'm going to try it out, but I need one essential thing: A metadata editor built in. I love the fact that Banshee and Clementine both have one, so it makes it extremely easy to edit my music. Does Audacious have a metadata editor, or no? I've been trying to find information on their website, but it seems as if their website is broken.\n\nA: To edit metadata with Audacious we can open track information from either Playback -> View track details or by right click on a track on your playlist. This shows all metadata available. These can be edited and saved (provided you have permissions to do so on the given file)\n\nIf your library contains many tracks that need editing you may be faster using an external track editor.\n", "Q: Partition is reported to be full, but I cannot \"see\" any culprit files So here's the deal:\n--df reports 100% usage on the partition hosting my /home directories (and only those)\n--Tools that use du (a la baobab or xdiskusage) report that the excessive space consumption is clearly related to my user.\n--Tools that use du do not, however, seem to be able to locate any files that are the culprit.  For example, xdiskusage shows my profile taking up > 260GB but only about half that amount of data actually in files (the rest is shown as just empty space).\n--Running du on CLI just shows what I've described above: my user's ~/ folder is consuming like twice as much disk space than it actually has files inside of it.\nAnd my favorite:\n--This appears to be correlated with uptime, as though some process is slowly filling the partition with data until the drive is full.  And when I reboot -- pooof! tons of free space.  Is there an introspection tool that'd let me ascertain, e.g., what process is writing to disk at any given time?\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I don't know what is causing the behavior you're observing, but I can imagine how it is happening:\nDue to the way Unix filesystem works, it is possible for an application to open a file, then unlink it (i.e. delete the file name entry from its parent directory) - the file handle still remains valid though there is no file name associated with it, and the application is still able to write to the file, because the handle is pointing to the inode, not to the filename.\nSuch a file exists until the application closes it. My understanding is that this is a common way to create a \"private\" temp file for an application.\nTo find such files, use\nlsof +L\n\nwhich will show you the number of links to each open file (NLINK column) - the unlinked files have 0 there. Here's how an unlinked file looks:\nCOMMAND     PID       USER   FD      TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NLINK       NODE NAME\n...\nmysqld     1126      mysql   11u      REG                8,1        0     0   33603687 /tmp/ibMlwWQA (deleted)\n\n\nA: The curious part is how this changes with time, and then goes away when you log out. More about that in a minute.\nHow are you running du in a way that accounts for hidden files in your home directory? For example compare the output of the following two commands, run from your home directory:\n(home)$ du -csxk *\n(home)$ du -csxk .\n\nThe \"dot\" form should always be bigger. A lot bigger, and you know that your extra space is in a hidden file. \ntry the following, again from $HOME:\n(home)$ find . -maxdepth 1 -print0 | xargs -0 du -cskx --exclude .gvfs | sort -rn\n\n(I exclude .gvfs because that's where gnome mounts remote file systems.)\nThat should return a list of all directories, including the hidden ones, sorted descending by size. A total line and your home (.) should be at the top, and because you're doing a grand total, the total line should be roughly twice your home size.\nFrom here, you can start drilling into large directories (my .thunderbird dir is big) looking for culprits.\nNow, about the time-correlated part of this. First, let's see if you can see the sizes change as you're logged in:\n(home)$ watch -n 10 'find . -maxdepth 1 -print0 | xargs -0 du -csxk --exclude .gvfs | sort -rn'\n\nThat will run the command every 10 seconds, so you can hopefully see things change over time. The next thing to do is trying to see the storage come back on logout. Make a second admin user (you need sudo privileges) and login as that user via a remote computer or something. As that user, sudo to root, and cd into your home and run the last command again, watching for something to change as you logout and login.\n", "Q: Expand variables in upstart script I have written several upstart scripts to start transmission-daemon for several users.

Here is what I did for my Lenovo T410 when it was having this shutdown problem. The steps are generic enough for any laptop.\nConfigure your bios to be more battery/power friendly\nRestart and boot to your Bios (you press some function key or, in Lenovo, the \"ThinkVantage\" button) and go to the power options and choose more performance friendly ones. Here are the settings I changed in my Lenovo's BIOS. Don't worry if your BIOS settings are different, just hunt around for what sounds Power related and make sure it's not set to maximize performance type options. My laptop's example BIOS settings: \n\n\n*\n\n*Speed Step Technology set to \"Enabled\" (I still have a need for speed). But \"Mode for AC\" and \"Mode for Battery\" both set to  to \"Maximum Battery\" (NOT \"Maximum Performance\").\n\n*Adaptive Thermal Management \"Enabled\". \"Scheme for AC\" and \"Scheme for Battery\" both set to  \"Balanced\"  ( NOT \"Maximize Performance\").\n\n*CPU power Management, PCI Power Management and PCI Express Management to \"Automatic\" (NOT \"Disabled\")\n\n\nDon't forget to save the bios settings before exiting.\nUpdate your BIOS\nSometimes the way the laptop talks to its parts (like the fan) changes in later BIOS versions. If you get the latest BIOS installed, there's a chance that if there was some issue in the BIOS that was causing the overheat, it might have been fixed. \nWarning!!! Back up your data before updating your BIOS!\nIt's usually safe to update but there's a chance things could go wrong. \nLenovo, in your case, makes it easy to update by having a bootable cd. You can google it like this: Lenovo T410 \"Bios Update\" \"Bootable CD\" (insert your model number instead of T410). You burn the .iso image and boot off of it and follow the on screen instructions to update the BIOS.\nCut down on heavy graphics effects in your Desktop\nGo into your Display settings and make sure that you don't overdo it with effects. If you're running beryl or some other effects engine, consider limiting the number of effects.\nMake sure the fan isn't stuck\nIf you want to maintain it and feel brave, remove the keyboard (typically unscrewing a few screws and gently prying it from the hinges under the bottom keys) and look at the fan and make sure there's no dust blocking it so that it can spin easily.\nMonitor the Temperature\nOn unity there is: \nsudo apt-get install indicator-power \n\nFor the command line, there is powertop \nsudo apt-get install indicator-power \n\nRun it from unity and check the boxes for monitoring the fan  and all the cores.\nMore great tips here.\n\nA: I think that this bug report on Launchpad can be related to your problem; check it out and, if you're sure that it is related, tell in the comments that the problem can affect also Ubuntu 11.10.

Am I missing any \"gotchas\" with this method?\n\nA: You can use xmodmap to remap any\nkey on the keyboard; in particular, you can remap the right Alt to\nact as a Super/Win key.\nCreate a file named .Xmodmap in your home directory with the\nfollowing content:\n! free up right-Alt for remapping\nremove mod1 = Alt_R\n\n! Right-Alt remapped to Super\nclear mod4\nkeycode 108 = Super_R\nadd mod4 = Super_R\n\nWhen you log out and then log in again, GNOME should ask you if you\nwant to load the .Xmodmap file; answer \"yes\" and you're ready to\ngo. (You will only asked once.)\nAlternatively, you can load the .Xmodmap configuration from a\nterminal at any time:\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\nThere are a few things that can vary depending on the X server version and keyboard model. The following items could help you adapt the .Xmodmap file to your specific environment.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that your right Alt key is initially on mod1: Issue the command\nxmodmap in a terminal window, and you should get an output like\nthis one:\nxmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock        Caps_Lock (0x9),  Caps_Lock (0x4e)\ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Alt_L (0xcc)\nmod2      \nmod3        Mode_switch (0xcb)\nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce)\nmod5      \n\nIf the Alt_R tag does not appear in the mod1 line but on a\ndifferent one, adjust your .Xmodmap accordingly.\n\n*Check that your right Alt key is keycode 108: in a terminal window,\ntype the command xev, then focus\nthe small square window that popped up.  If you type the right\nAlt key there, you should see lines appearing in the terminal\nwindow.  Look for a stanza like this one:\nKeyPress event, serial 25, synthetic NO, window 0x5000001,\n    root 0xbd, subw 0x5000002, time 867397196, (53,48), root:(54,49),\n    state 0x0, keycode 108 (keysym 0xffea, Alt_R), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nThe number after the keycode word is the one you want in your\n.Xmodmap file for remapping right Alt.\n", "Q: LVM allocations change after restart I have been running Ubuntu as a dual boot with XP on a caddy.

Install ‘Ubuntu Restricted Extras’ – codecs/plugins\nYou need to install the audio mp3 (MPEG Layer 3) decoders as it’s required for playing your mp3 songs), similarly you need to install Adobe flash player on Ubuntu 11.10 for playing flash content such as YouTube Videos (although they are trying to replace the flash dependencies with HTML 5). You can install all these proprietary plugins/codecs by installing the package called ‘ubuntu restricted extras’. Open a terminal and execute the command -\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nRestricted library/packages for playing encrypted DVD’s\nAlthough you’ve installed ‘ubuntu-restricted-extra’, you still won’t be able to play any proprietary DVD (which is usually encrypted with CSS(Content Scramble System) ). Therefore You also need to install libdvdcss2, a free software library for unscrambling/accessing those DVDs. Open terminal and execute the following commands (You may need to reboot) -\nsudo apt-get install libdvdread4\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\n3 install cheese – webcam software/driver for your webcam\nIf you want to use your webcam for taking pictures or recording videos then you must need a webcam software. Cheese is the most popular webcam software, and it’s already there in Ubuntu Software Center, or install it from terminal -\nsudo apt-get install cheese\n\n4. Install Chromium Web browser for faster browsing\nchromium\nChromium - Browsing with Speed\nFirefox is the default web browser in Ubuntu 11.10, which is slow and very unstable (if you’ve multiple tabs and add-on’s installed). On the other hand Chromium is pretty fast and it’s popularity is increasing exponentially. So it’s a must have Application on Ubuntu (or any other OS). Chromium supports all the extensions/themes that you use on Chrome. it’s one of the most popular software in Ubuntu Software Center. So you can install it in a single click from Ubuntu Software Center, or just type the command in terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T ) :\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nYou should install some codecs like FFmpeg for playing multimedia contents on web.\nsudo apt-get install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\n\nIf you want to use chrome then go here – I’ve already explained about – installing Google Chrome on Ubuntu 11.10, in detail.\n5. Install VLC Player\nVLC player is one of the most popular open source media player. It is commonly called as – ‘all in one‘ media player, it has lot of features that you expect from a modern media player. On Ubuntu 11.10 – it’s a must have application – for video player it’s probably the best one. VLC player is capable of playing a wide range media formats such as mp3, avi, mp4, flv etc. Since it’s available in Ubuntu Software Center – you can either install it from there or type the command -\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\n6. Install any Image editing program\nAn image editing/creating software is necessary for every one, by default no such program is installed. So you’re recommended to install an image editor.\nGIMP is the most popular open source and free image editor, having features similar to Adobe Photoshop. GIMP has a lot of powerful features which allows you to create complex graphics designs/images. it is more suitable for intermediate users – those having some experience in image editing. To install gimp – either search in Ubuntu Software Center or install it from terminal -\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nFor some extra set of brushes, gradients and plugins etc execute :\nsudo apt-get install gimp-data-extras\nsudo apt-get install gimp-plugin-registry\n\n\nA: For my 2008 MB, I put this line in the Startup Applications to make it more manageable:\nsynclient FingerLow=10; synclient FingerHigh=20\n\n\n\nA: You should list the version of Ubuntu that you are using.\nThe first questions that you need to ask yourself are what is missing (at least according to your knowledge) and what do you want it to do? \"Complete\" could mean various things to different people.\nAnswering the question of whether or not you are missing a driver can be answered by checking the functionality of your hardware. For instance, are all drives, bluetooth, wifi and display properly functional? You can check your drives by inserting media to removable drives or browsing (after mounting) hard drives. For Bluetooth and wifi, check your connectivity. Verify that they properly transmit and receive data. As far as video, verify that your video is displayed properly; you can do this by eye or via the graphics card properties in the system.\n\nA: If things are missing you could run the test that comes with Ubuntu. It's called \"system testing\", look for it in the unity dash. Running this will allow you to identify any problems and then you can ask more direct questions on how to fix them, for example if DVDs won't play we could point you to this post: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/06/how-to-enable-dvd-playback-in-ubuntu-11-04/ (Which is for 11.04, but I think it still works).

What icon does Unity use for the application?\n\nA: Icons are cached in one very big file:\n\nGTK+ can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid\n  a lot of system call and disk seek overhead when the application\n  starts. Since the format of the cache files allows them to be mmap()ed\n  shared between multiple applications, the overall memory consumption\n  is reduced as well.\n\nEvery theme should create a cache file on installation.\n/usr/share/icons/[theme]/icon-theme.cache\n\nSo for example - if you remove/rename the gnome icon-cache file:\nsudo mv /usr/share/icons/gnome/icon-theme.cache /usr/share/icons/gnome/icon-theme.cache.backup\n\nYou can then regenerate the cache:\nsudo gtk-update-icon-cache --force /usr/share/icons/gnome\n\nIn your case, you have added your application icons to hicolor - therefore you should force the regeneration of this cache file to pick up the new icons:\nsudo gtk-update-icon-cache --force /usr/share/icons/hicolor\n\nsource\n\nA: When I first asked the question I didn't know that the icon used in the Dash is different from the one used for the Launcher Item. I assumed Unity only uses icons from /usr/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/ or /usr/share/pixmaps/ since that's where I installed all the icons but I was wrong.\nWhen you open the Dash to start an application, Ubuntu uses one of the icons mentioned in the question but when the application is displayed in the Launcher (as a Launcher Item) then its icon is the icon of the application. In my case, I'm running a Java application so it's the icon I set using JFrame#setIconImage(Image).\nI was using a 16x16 pixel icon which looked blurry in the Launcher. Now, I'm using a 64x64 pixel icon and it looks much better.\n\nA: For most uses the icon is what is specified the the apps .desktop on the Icon= line.\nTypically these .desktops are in /usr/share/applications & can be opened in a text editor (though not 'normally' from the context menu) or check it's properties for a remedial way to edit if need be.

This is actually not very obvious any more and I can't point you to the answer directly...\nIf you open the system-monitor gui application, or run top in a shell, you will see the most active processes at any one time. Doing this whilst interacting with CCSM should help you to identify it's process name.

Well, of course, you could always change it in the source code, but I'm guessing that's not what you're looking for. \nHowever, you might be glad to know that this has been changed in Precise (to become 12.04).

When I started using ubuntu 11.10 (with unity) I noticed it took a little while. Then I remembered about the preload app (and how it sped up the loading of applications by cache-ing) and the times were reduced immensely.\nAs I tried Gnome Shell, I started to realize I liked it better than unity (still not 100% secure heh); but there is a big drawback: terminals seem to take ages to load. Just to illustrate, I just opened LibreOffice Writer in about 4/5 of the time it takes to open a terminal.\nWhy is this happening, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I should have specified that I have an nVidia graphics card, but I didn't even think the graphics driver could slow down the whole system.\nI read elsewhere that using the \"Recommended\" nVidia driver from the Additional Drivers application could speed up the Gnome Shell (or perhaps it would be better described as not slow down). I did, and the problem was fixed. I hope this is useful for somebody else.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Terminals takes too much time to open (15-20seconds).\nI installed the  \"Recommended\" nVidia driver from the Additional Drivers as you described. But the PC rebooted to console login.

Even with the newer versions of Nautilus that use dconf, there is no option to change this setting:\n\nUbuntu 12.10 and up\nIn Ubuntu 12.10 (so far) it seems Nautilus no longer has this problem. If the final version comes with the standard Nautilus 3.6, you will be able to change the column width freely.\n\nA: As Roland Taylor said, the way Nautilus handles columns is at present not easily tweakable without writing some additional code and patching the application, which would not be trivial to do because of the way column handling is built in to Nautilus. There really is no way to do it in Nautilus by altering any configuration settings.\nHowever, I was encouraged by con-f-use to give an answer relating to Thunar, the lightweight Xfce file manager. In Thunar it is very easy to set the widths of the columns in list view and they stay fixed until you feel the need to alter them. All you need to do is go to view > configure columns and uncheck the setting to 'automatically expand columns as needed'.\nThe screenshot displays the column setting and behind it you can see the adjusted columns in list view- any changes made to them are saved when exiting Thunar, unlike in Nautilus.\nFuture versions of Nautilus will probably adopt this feature (Ronald Taylor points out that it may be available in Nautilus 3.6 in Ubuntu 12.10), but for now this Thunar solution is unfortunately the only solution for people who want fixed columns.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem under Ubuntu 14.04, Nautilus 3.10.1.\nIn Nautilus edit/file settings/display I checked \"navigate folders in tree view\" and discovered that the problems are gone.\nI use German system language, therefore the exact names might be off.\n\nA: As i only have installed the German version, some translations of the menu might be different, but anyhow it will work if you enter the values below.\nConfigure fixed column-width\n\n\n*\n\n*open Terminal \n\n*type in gconf-editor /apps/nautilus/list_view\n\n*[right mouseclick] -> create / make  key\n\n*at name type in: all_columns_have_same_width\ntype:        boolean\nvalue:       true\n\n*close the editor. et voilà\nOr, simply, execute gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /apps/nautilus/list_view/all_columns_have_same_width true in Terminal\nThe column width will stay now the same in nautilus, no matter of the length of the file name.\nAlso after closing and re-opening, all columns will have the same size.\nGood alternatives to the nautilus commander are: \"Krusader\", \"Tux-Commander\" and for whom who is missing Norton Commander : \"GNOME Commander\".\n(For a continuesly backup i would entrust you „back in time“)\n", "Q: How to install USC 5.0 in 11.04?

Moving windows around, however, is very laggy. Why? This isn't a question about Ubuntu being laggy in general - not at all, in fact, it's very slick and fast for me.

I'm a programmer who works with Linux daily (both as a job and as an interest) so technical instructions are fine.\nI've noticed that Compiz uses a lot of CPU when moving windows around and it's memory usage is relatively high (though possibly expected for Compiz):\n1671 user     20   0  478m 286m  33m S    1  7.3  12:44.05 compiz\nAnd one more thing - occasionally moving windows around is fast.

You should also now have smooth window movement.\nSource\n\n\nA: I have the same issue and I've been troubleshooting it for some time time. Turning off V-sync in compiz and nvidia-settings does help a bit, but it doesn't solve it entirely nor do I think it's the cause of the problem. And when I check PowerMizer, everything looks ok. It is set to Maximum Performance (Performance Level 0), so I doubt this is the problem.\nYou can try to manually add the following line to the Device section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf:\nOption \"RegistryDwords\" \"PowerMizerEnable=0x1; PerfLevelSrc=0x3322; PowerMizerDefaultAC=0x1\"\n\nJust make sure that the indentation is the same as the other lines in there.\nWhen I recorded this behavior I noticed that the mouse in the recording moves around normally while on screen it was freezing just like the rest of the desktop. Not sure if this helps, but thought it might be worth noting.\nI have come to the conclusion that this gets worse over time. It is all fine right after boot (or restart of Compiz or X). But after a while it gets more and more sluggish until moving windows around will more or less freeze your whole desktop (like in screen cap) until you stop moving it. Memorly leak perhaps?\n\nA: I have the same problem on 3 computers all running Ubuntu. I found that the only solution was to go back to Ubuntu 11.04 (and miss out on all the 11.10 goodies - like the new and improved Software Centre).\nI believe this is the bug report for this problem:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/861061\nI hope it is fixed soon so that Canonical will reach its 200 million user target :).\n\nA: The solution that worked for me was CCSM >> Composite >> Disable the automatic refresh rate, and manually set it to anywhere below 25.\n\nA: Try this, install CompizConfig Settings Manager go to the OpenGL settings and disable Sync to vBlank. \n\nA: There can be an issue with cards that have powermizer & are set to 'adaptive', though not sure that's the case with you, ie. that you have powermizer - ck. nvidia-settings.\nIn the above case whenever the gpu clock is at it's lowest setting there can be a small lag when an action requires a higher clock speed. Moving windows is one such example, some scrolling scenarios also show this.\nIf you have powermizer, -  to test - set the preferred to Max performance & see. This setting only lasts till unset in nvidia-settings or a restart.\nIf this is the case this can be adjusted in xorg.conf, I use a section that keeps the gpu on max when on ac, on adaptive when on battery.\nThis behavior is only seen here with compiz-0.9.X, worse in 11.10 than 11.04 where it was minimal\n\nA: Aha! If you install the compiz settings manager and go to \"Move Window\" and turn the opacity right down to 1, it is no longer laggy for me.\nNow hey, that's not a perfect fix, in fact it's damn annoying but it's better than using Unity2D (which is buggy I find).\n\nA: I'm also having this issue.  I'm running dual monitors on an nvidia 9600gt.  I have so far noticed no other issue other than window moving.  When I first boot up or restart or restart compiz the problem goes away.  I can then launch two terminals.  One I start up top in, the other I just start moving in a circle.  Within about a minute of moving the window the movement starts to slow, then it starts to crawl.  Soon enough I can move the mouse and not have the window follow at all.  Looking over in the top window I see that Xorg is using about 60% cpu and compiz is using another 30% (core i7 860).  Once I get the windows to start moving slowly, they will continue to move slowly no matter how much time I give the machine to recover.\nI noticed that turning off window decorations in ccsm fixes the lag, but obviously makes for other usability problems.  \nI have also tried a whole host of settings \nTurning DynamicTwinView false\nTurning off Sync to blank in the ccsm Opengl Plugin\nTurning off \"detect Refresh Rate\" and setting refresh rate to 120hz *(which is twice my actual refresh rate)  in CCSM Composite Plugin\nNone of the above have fixed my issue.\n\nA: Disabling this option made my window movements a lot smoother.

That way you will get basic functionality so you can change your drivers.\nMy issue was resolved when I upgraded to 11.10, even though the ATI drivers were the same.

(Ref: ArchWiki):\nTo read the current setting:\nGSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri\n\nTo set the new slideshow: \nGSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri 'file:///home/username/path/to/your/slideshow.xml'\n\nMaybe you have created an XML slideshow previously, or you can use this script.\nI can recommend Crebs, which unfortunately isn't available for Ubuntu 11.10 through PPA, but you can download and install the package for Natty (which is a little bit risky), or use the source package - once extracted, you don't have to install anything, just run the script crebs/bin/crebs script (note that Crebs may have some dependencies, run the script from terminal to find out).\nOnce you create and save Crebs slideshow you like, the resulting XML is saved to ~/.crebs/ directory - as mentioned above, just run:\nGSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file://$HOME/.crebs/MySuperCoolSlideshow.xml\"\n\n(remember to change the file name) and the slideshow will be instantly applied.\n\nA: You can go to the terminal and type\nwallch -h\n\nThere is an option to make it run in the background.\nWallch options\n  -h or --help Show help options.\n  --earth      Starts live earth wallpaper, updating every 30 minutes.\n  --once       Change desktop background once by picking randomly an image from the list.\n  --constant   Starts changing randomly pictures from the list, without opening the Wallch GUI.\n\nNotes\n--once and --constant will only work if you have at least 2 images in the list.\n--earth will only work if you have Internet connection.\n\nNot sure if this helps, but yeah :)\nI usually do\nwallch --constant\n\nthen I Ctrl+Z to stop it and get back into the terminal, then I type bg to send the process to the background so it keeps running.\n\nA: I'm really late to this post, but seeing that there is no accepted answer yet, I will post my own.\nThere's an easy way to create a separate wallpaper slideshow by adding another XML file to /usr/share/backgrounds/. \nDownload the XML background creator, extract it into your home directory. Then run \n install.sh. This will create a new Nautilus script which you can use to create your wallpaper slideshow. You can try to make your own XML file, but frankly, this is a lot easier.\nNow load all the images you want into a folder (preferably /usr/share/backgrounds/foler_name_here, since you can't move the images anywhere else once you have created the XML). Navigate to that folder in Nautilus, right-click, go to \"Scripts\", and select \"XML background creator\". Now choose the settings you want, and a new XML file should appear. \nNow you need to make some changes so that the Appearances dialogue will recognize your new slideshow.\nsudo gedit /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ubuntu-wallpapers.xml\n\nNow add this somewhere:\n<wallpaper deleted=\"false\">\n     <name>name_of_slideshow</name>\n     <filename>path_to_your_XML.xml</filename>\n     <options>zoom</options>\n</wallpaper>\n\nBe sure to replace \"path_to_your_XML.xml\" with your the actual path.\nNow, if you open the \"Appearance\" settings again, you should see your own slideshow along with the others.\n\nA: Check out this forum post.\nI think it's exactly what you want.

What programme? Some will expect a considerable amount stored in the RAM.\n\nA: No consequences, you will be fine. It's only a problem if your system needs more memory than RAM + swap size.\n\nA: My laptop has 3GB of RAM, but 1 is cached for graphics only, so actually system may only use 2GB, and common usage has never reached over 1.5GB.

The solution I found was to change the shell theme to default Ubuntu GNOME 3 using the gnome-tweak-tool. This fixed me up.  Seems like certain themes have compatibility issues.\n\nA: There is probably not an easy solution, you would have to file a bug report upstream with gnome for any type of resolution.\nFWIW I filed a similar bug report with gnome a few months ago now (was using Fedora 15 at the time).\nIn my experience :\n\n\n*\n\n*As advised, the default theme, including default icon set, works best. If you make customizations you are at higher risk for problems.\n\n*There is some variability with the driver you use. Personally I use Nvidia. With the nouveau driver I got hard lockups and the only way to recover was with a hard reboot. With the nvidia driver, I did not get lockups but lost my icons.\nI also had lockups when using the search, often I could recover by restarting gnome-shell (Alt + F2 , hit the r then Enter - you may not see any output on the screen during that sequence of keyboard activity ), or restarting X (did not have to hard boot with a lock up when searching).\nWhen this (lockups) happens, you will need to ssh in from another box and pull the logs (for bug reports).\nFWIW, here is an example of the kind of information you will be asked (probably from upstream)\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=716619\nI know it is old and from fedora, but, that is the sort of thing you are looking at and I can tell you from personal experience what the gnome developers will expect.\nFWIW, the bug report I filed with gnome.bugzilla was unresolved and is so old that it no longer exists (I searched).\nAt the end of the day, it was easier to upgrade the nvidia card.\n\nA: revert the theme into the original theme or download theme that is compatible with gnome shell version that you have.\n\nA: To recover, probably a cleaner way is to terminal via ctrl+alt+f1 and then restart lightdm. \nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo service lightdm start\n\n\nA: this is a known problem. you can temporarily remove nautilus-pastebin plugin, until the upstream patch makes it into Ubuntu.\nfor more details, see the upstream bug.\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=741964\n\nA: may be this can help you..\nit works for me..\nhttp://blog.seanja.com/2012/03/fix-gnome-3-auto-complete-cras/\nClear out the recently-used list:\necho \"\" > ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\nthen set the immutable bit to prevent all changes to the file (even by root)\nsudo chattr +i ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\n", "Q: Why is there no visual feedback when I click an icon in the launcher?

As most of you know GNU Screen is a nice tool that enables you to do something like:\n\nOne other good use for the detach and reattach is as a console-mode\n  \"remote desktop\" feature. You can detach from a screen session at\n  work, shell into the machine from home, and reattach. Very, very\n  handy.

Aka instead of logut i type magiclogout and next time I login I get my old sesion(if OS hasnt reeboted ofc)\n\nA: byobu is based on screen ; it has a menu option to make it your default shell.\nYou can either exit as normal or detach with alt-A, D as you would with plain screen, and your session will be waiting when you log in again.\nIn addition it adds a number of keys for terminal management, F2 to create a new terminal, and F3 and F4 to move between windows, and a status bar with a number of useful indicators like outstanding package updates.\nIt's installed by default on Ubuntu Server builds, and rapidly becomes my default terminal on most servers I manage.\nAs I said, byobu depends on screen to work though... I'm not aware of any way of resuming a session other than having a process stay running on the target machine.\nEdit : byobu will also wrap tmux (which is the default on newer versions of Ubuntu). You don't have to do anything in most cases - it will just use the default terminal multiplexer.\n\nA: you might want to have a look at tmux\n\nA: You could have something like this with a remote desktop software that create its own session, like for example FreeNX on the server and NoMachine client on the client.\nYou can also use this with server and client machine being the same machine, so as to simulate what you ask for.\n\nA: This not possible without using screen, byobu (as mentioned by Adrian) or similar tools.\nAn interactive shell must be connected to a tty. If you logout, the shell looses the connection to the tty and exits.\nScreen and friends avoid this by creating one or more persistent virtual ttys. When you logout, the shell remains connected to the virtual tty and does not notice that the user was disconnected.\nFor non-interactive programs, a tty is not required and instead of screen, you could use nohup.\nAs Adrian points out, it is possible use byobu per default, and, as you know, many power users will just start screen as the very first thing they do after login. Is there a specific reason, you want to avoid screen?\n\nA: You can start a command via nohup:\nnohup command &\n\nIf you would like to have the output somewhere saved do \nnohup command > output.txt &\n\nNow you have to detach the running software by\n\n\n*\n\n*pressing CTRL-Z\n\n*enter bg\n\n*disown %1\nMore hints to nohup can be found in its manpage (http://ss64.com/osx/nohup.html), same for disown (http://ss64.com/osx/disown.html).\n", "Q: Is there a future for Gnome Classic? Note: This question has the potential to cause unneccessary debate about the merits and demerits of Unity, Gnome3, and Gnome Classic. I would like to avoid that and concentrate solely on the issue of future support for Gnome Classic. Thanks for your help!\nI am using Gnome Classic, which suits me more than either Unity or the Gnome3 shell.\nI think it has the potential to be the best of all possible worlds, in that it has the new Gnome3 code base which appears to be faster and more stable, and also approximates the things that I feel made the Gnome 2.2 shell great.\nHowever, it is not perfect. There are some minor faults in the way panels, the desktop, and other details are handled.\nOver time, by asking questions and hopefully getting help, maybe I could resolve those issues and arc towards a UI that I fully enjoy. Also, I would hope that simultaneously, there are big fixes and development happens.\nHowever, I am unsure about whether or not this is worth the effort. Is Gnome Classic just the remnants of Gnome 2.2, and will not be supported or developed further?\nIs there a chance it will be forked and possibly expanded upon?\nIs there anyone who is working to make Gnome Classic equal in priority to the other shells?\nIn order to make decisions about whether or not it's worth asking questions, I'd like to know if Gnome Classic is a living, breathing, project, or, is it dead on arrival? Will it cease to even exist in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: The Gnome Classic in 11.10 is Gnome Panel 3. It has been ported to GTK 3, so there's no reason not to support it. The question of development is mostly a question of popularity. Gnome Panel 2 have been very popular, but I'm not entirely sure that's because of the panels themselves, but because of the large number of available applets that is available for it. From a users perspective, these were quite nice, but from a developers perspective, the technology they were based on, are horribly outdated. So the question remains if anyone is going to actually port them to the new platform. If that happens, then I think Gnome Panel 3 can have a good future, but it requires quite a bit of effort and somebody has to do the work. \nBecause of this, I am a little bit sceptical that it will \"take off\". It seems more likely to me that people who want a similar environment to Gnome 2 will move on to Xfce, which already has a community and some momentum. I don't think Gnome referring to it as a fallback helps create enthusiasm to rebuild the Gnome 2 experience on Gnome 3. \nBut this is pure speculation. It's impossible to tell how this will unfold. \n\nA: Perhaps Gnome Classic should be renamed Gnome Panel or Gnome Expert Mode. I don't want to use Gnome Classic as a way of holding onto the past but as an approach I prefer. Others may prefer Gnome 3 or Unity and I am happy for them.\n\nA: Your question calls for speculation.  So here's mine...\nI would wager that, with time, Unity shell and Gnome shell will add back the menu features found in Gnome2 so that users can use whichever approach is most efficient for a given task.  Or at least I hope that's what will happen.  But in the meantime, I'm using Gnome shell along with Cairo Dock (cairo-dock), which offers a Gnome2-like menu among many other goodies.  That way, I get the best of all worlds.\n", "Q: Does Gnome-Shell require more resources from my memory and/or hardware than Unity? I found a script online which lets me confirm that Unity will work just fine with my computer (I think I found it on OMGU! if anyone needs the link I'll add it) but when I try to log in using Gnome-Shell the system hangs badly, even when doing things as simple as trying to browse my applications.  Is it possible that I would have problems running Gnome-Shell even though Unity 3D works fine?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. Gnome Shell uses Mutter whereas the standard Unity uses Compiz. Since they're different solutions, they have different requirements with regards to drivers. That means Unity might work well and Gnome Shell not, or vice versa.\n", "Q: Adding a custom launcher to Unity \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I create launchers on my desktop? \n\nI understand that I should be able to right-click on my Unity desktop and select 'Create Launcher'.

The first is the 'no disk' bug already answered. The second is the 'no root file system' message described here.\nFor Wubi installs this problem is usually caused by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Minor partition table errors that Ubuntu is more sensitive too than windows\n\n*An unsupported fakeraid (e.g. 0 or 1+0)\n\n*A mix of GPT and MBR partition tables, usually from reusing a drive from a Mac.\n\n\nWhen you get that error, drop to a shell (Ctrl+Alt+F2) and run sudo parted -l - that will tell you if there's a partition table error. sudo fdisk -l tells you about the GPT mix and also shows specifics on the partition table (to identify what errors might be present).\n\nA: This appears to be a bug which is reported here. Try this:\n\nDisable all your USB drives, your unused optical drives (with no ubuntu CD), and any virtual drive or cardreader.

So is there a way to get my computer to turn it on before suspending, but then turning it back off when it resumes? Any ways at solving this would be much appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: You can have scripts or commands run automatically before and after suspending. Just create a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d/. It should be named without an extension, like 75ati_toggle. The Arch Linux Wiki has some shows the general convention for naming the scripts (link here). Anyway, the contents of the script could be something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to disable and enable the discrete graphics card before suspend and after resume\n\ncase \"${1}\" in\nsuspend)\n  # Commands to enable the graphics card before suspend goes here\n  ;;\nresume)\n  # Commands to disable the graphics card after resume goes here\n  ;;\nesac\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You can also turn it ON and then OFF after waking up. \nThis is a known bug reported to Ubuntu on launchpad here.\nIt was reported as well to the Linux kernel at the following link.\n\nA: I had a similar problem in a Toshiba A350-22E and what I did was:\nboot up\nsuspend\nwake up\nsimple as that.

You basically chose which interface you wanted when you installed.\nIs there any Ubuntu Live DVD with that?\n\nA: No, while many distributions come with this feature, Ubuntu lacks it. There are plenty of derivatives such as Kubuntu and Lubuntu each with its own desktop so you should be able to find your preferred desktop environment with one of them. If you want Gnome or multiple desktops the only way way to get them is to find their meta packages in Synaptic and install them from there.

This way I can fsck for example the partition that is normally running Ubuntu but without having it running it at that moment.\nThe recovery partition would have access to some tools to check the disck, memory, etc.\nIs this doable?\nJust to clarify with the whole recovery partition, I would boot the PC and load the normal GRUB menu but it would have an additional option to load some kind of image that would load into memory and from there it would start the system (Everything running from memory). So I could for example, do a fsck on all hard drives and do other checking while taking the advantage of the increased speed of using the memory to host the recovery system (Without using the hard drives).\n\nA: For this to work you would actually have to access the memory and partition it at the BIOS level. Instruct the BIOS to, or not to, parse the the allocated memory blocks when booting. \nIt would add another level of security also. Recovery accessed by using a administrative password. \nIn theory this would be as a SSD only living on the RAM. If this were to work there would be no need for a grub loader as all the hard instruction would load when you pressed the power button. Sweet!!! instant on. \nI don't know of any way to flash the memory with that kind of detailed instruction.\n\nA: You certainly could create an additional partition on your hard drive for recovery purposes. Another option would be to image the disk you'd like to protect. Remember, though, that if your bootloader program (such as GRUB) fails then you will need another strategy. I have successfully restored systems with damaged bootloaders by using a live cd, and you will definitely want to have a live cd with the latest Ubuntu distro just in case.\nYou might want to see the documentation for Ubuntu file recovery, as well:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\nMake sure the hard drive partition containing Ubuntu is \"unmounted\" before creating a new partition. First, make a live cd and then use it to open a partition manager:\n\n*\n\n*Follow the instructions to create a live cd or usb if you don't already have one:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download\n\n\n*Boot from your live cd, just like you probably did when you installed Ubuntu for the first time.\n\n\n*Open a partition manager such as \"GParted\". Follow the on-screen instructions carefully to create a new partition while minimizing changes to existing partitions (When you choose a file system for the new partition, keep in mind that some file system types aren't recognized by Windows). Be careful--it's very easy to make a mistake here.\n\n\n*You will probably want to make this new partition bootable. The partition manager should allow you to flag it as \"bootable\", but make sure to install some sort of operating system to it if you intend to boot from it. Make sure your bootloader recognizes the new partition upon boot. If you are using GRUB, you may be able to edit the operating system menu directly by changing an entry in the \"grub\" file:\nhttp://www.hackourlife.com/change-default-boot-order-for-grub-2-in-ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-ocelot/\nInformation on creating a recovery disk image is posted here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery#Extract_filesystem_from_recovered_image\n", "Q: network manager says \"device not managed\" I used to be able to share my network connection by editing the Auto Eth0 to share with other computers in the Ipv4 section and now I upgraded my laptop to 11.10 .\nNow are there no wired connections in the network manager.

If neither of them have [keyfile] seperated by a new line, network-manager crashes (confirmed).  If both of them have [keyfile] separated by a new line, presumably as before network-manager will crash (unconfirmed).  Presumably [keyfile] means \"use this file as config\" hence the aforementioned network-manager behavior.  So one of those files should be empty and the other should have [keyfile] followed by new line and the rest of the command.  So in Ubuntu the /usr/ file will always be zeroed unless possibly way back like 14.04 or earlier.

Even though the device seems to be working properly, Network Manager shows device status to be unmanaged. \nIf this a normal user's pc with simple network configuration like connecting via DHCP and automatic configuration, simply out comment the lines and restart network manager. \n$ sudo restart network-manager\n\nIf situations other than these, please explain.\n\nA: I had the same problem, I solved it by commenting the lines where the unmanaged device was mentioned, by mac address, in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf.\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\ndns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\n[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=mac:00:26:2d:fd:5c:e0\n\nchanged to \n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\ndns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\n\\#[keyfile]\n\n\\#unmanaged-devices=mac:00:26:2d:fd:5c:e0\n\n\nA: wired device not managed\nMost probably your interface appears in /etc/network/interfaces. By default, NetworkManager does not manage interfaces that appear in /etc/network/interfaces. You can change this behaviour.\nTo do this - in a terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nchange the line managed=false to managed=true\nSave, stop and start network manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nAlternatively, you can remove the interface from /etc/network/interfaces.\nbackup the current interfaces file:\nsudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network_interfaces_backup\n\nThen open the file:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nDelete everything in that file and copy and paste the following:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nSave, stop and start network manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\n\nDouble check in network manager (click on the indicator) that you have Enabled Networking ticked and you should also force deletion of old \"wired connections\" and selecting the new wired connection shown in the network manager indicator.\n\nA: wired device not managed\nI had the same problem with a fresh install on my Asus Eee PC 1005HA. The live environment worked with no problems, but once installed I couldn't get the connection to respond or to not read \"device not managed\". When I changed the text in this configuration file and restarted Network Manager everything worked!\ngksudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nfor lubuntu:\ngksudo leafpad /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nNow the text editor will open. Find the line managed=false and replace false with true and save the file (ctrl+s) and close the file. \nRestart your computer or the NetworkManager service (sudo service network-manager restart).\n\nA: wireless device not managed\nI've also found this issue after installing the Ubuntu 11.10 alternate version.\nIn my case, the /etc/network/interfaces was configured during installation to download new packages, and the conflict arose after the NetworkManager was set up during the first session.\nThe solution I've found was commenting the lines related to the wlan interface in the /etc/network/interfaces (in console, sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces or your editor of choice):\n\n# The primary network interface\n#auto wlan0\n#iface wlan0 inet dhcp\n#    wpa-ssid [your_ssid]\n#    wpa-psk [your_wpa_password]\n\nAnd then, as Joseph VanPelt proposed, set managed=false in the /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and running sudo service network-manager restart.\n\nA: There are two ways to manage network connections. You either have to do everything thru the network manager and remove everything Except the Loopback entry in /etc/network/interfaces\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nor totally remove the network manager thru the package manager or terminal and use the /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolve.conf file to control your connections. If not you will see the error you are getting. Even with static IP I've found that the network manager makes things easy and you can configure your IPV4 connections thru the menu.\n\nA: wireless device not managed\nThis is because the alternate images were for a period of time, configuring the wireless networks in /etc/network/interfaces; which causes NetworkManager to, on purpose, ignore the interface and consider them online.\nA good solution if you want to simply use your wireless connection (or wired) with DHCP is to comment out these settings in /etc/network/interfaces for all interfaces except lo, and reboot your system or restart NetworkManager like so:\n\nsudo restart network-manager\n\nOf course, this means you will need to enter your wireless settings into NetworkManager (password, etc) after clicking on the right item from the applet menu.\n\nA: Just to add a non-default answer, this can also happen if your computer has a hardware ON/OFF switch for the Wi-Fi interface. If you have such a \"killswitch\", ensure that you haven't accidentally turned the interface off\n\nA: In 11.10 you can go to System Settings and you should see a Network Icon. Run that utility and you should see tabs for your network devices, wired and wireless. Each tab has a slider that allows you to switch the device off. Or in your case switch eth0 or wired connection 1, as it is now called, on. May be. At least check that it not switched to off.\nregards.\n", "Q: Grab Handles appearing randomly, causes erratic mouse behavior  I did a clean install of Ubuntu 11.10 recently. Every so often, Grab Handles will appear on the active window. Sometimes they simply disappear after a few seconds without causing me any problems. \nOther times, the mouse appears already grabbing the window (like when you grab the center handle) and the mouse and the window will shake erratically for a few moments. In this case, I lose control over the mouse until the grab handles fade out a few seconds later. This occurs multiple times a day, maybe once every hour or two. The oddest thing about it is that I don't have Grab Handles enabled: \n\nFor reference, this is an Asus G53SW laptop with a Core i7, GeForce GTX 460M and 6 GB of RAM. Any ideas?\n\nA: It would seem to me, despite the response in the comments, that disabling the Unity MT Grab Handles option in ccsm should be able to turn these off, erratic mouse behavior notwithstanding.\nSteps to disable the grab handles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm). You can do this either by clicking the provided link, or by opening a terminal and entering sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager, providing your password as needed.\n\nWARNING: ccsm has been known to break Compiz if you are not careful! Try not to mess around in it too much.\n\n\n*Start CompizConfig Settings Manager. Look for a plugin called Unity MT Grab Handles. It should be at the very bottom when you scroll all the way down, under Uncategorized. Click its entry to enter its settings.\n\n*Once in, find the checkbox labeled Enable Unity MT Grab Handles on the left side of the window under Use This Plugin. Uncheck it. This should be all you need to do; close ccsm.\nIf there is still an issue, then perhaps you should file a bug if then restarting Compiz does not work (compiz --replace).\n\nA: I found a way to fix this while I was trying to find a way to redefine 3 finger gestures.  I posted how I did it there: How can I disable arbitrary default multitouch gestures in Unity?\nLet me know if that fixes it for you.\n", "Q: Applications icon in the dash keeps disappearing Inside the Dash there are some links at the bottom - home, applications, files, music.\nThe applications icon keeps disappearing, and then reappearing after.  No particular event or key press.\nWhat's wrong?\n\n\nError confirmed and still occurring intermittently with all updates applied as of 21 Jan '12 Two screenshots above are <1 min apart, nothing else running.\n\nA: It's difficult to answer that question based on so little information. But lenses (the different views in the dash) are separate applications that work independently. This means that it is possible for a lens to crash without causing any large issues, and then they would disappear from the dash and be restarted, causing them to come back. \nBut this is pure speculation. If you are able to provide more details, then it might be possible to expand on the answer, or if it's a problem, then you can file a bug on http://launchpad.net.

You can't host blogger on your own computer while you can do that with Wordpress. If you'll be using their online services (blogger.com or wordpress.com) for the blog hosting, then it really doesn't matter which from Ubuntu's perspective.\n\nA: Blogger works perfectly well in Ubuntu (I believe that Wordpress should be ok too, as both are web based).\nI recommend Blogger, since it has more resources than Wordpress.com.\nWordpress.org is the GPL version that can be downloaded (but requires a paid hosting service) it's better.

That's like 99% official ^^.\nAnyway the question is regarding all PPA's that have the untrusted flag in them.\n\nA: You can try to remove the PPA and the signature by clicking on settings in update manager and then delete the appropriate entries from \"other software\" tab and the signature from the authentication tab. \nAfter that, reload the package list and then enable the ppa by adding ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa as a new software source in the settings dialogue and update manager will automatically download the signature.\n\nA: This is a generic issue for all Ubuntu releases.\nRun from a terminal \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nthat should throw up the signature that is wrong:\n\nUse the numbers after the NO_PUBKEY to replace XXXXXXXXX  in the following\nsudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com XXXXXXXXX\n\n\nSimilar Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the easiest way to resolve apt-get BADSIG GPG errors?\n\nA: To cover the issue of why it comes up (rather than how to fix it, as fossfreedom has covered)\n\nI mean it is the PPA for Wine. That's like 99% official\n\nBut how do you know that the packages you download are from the server you think they are from and not from someone intercepting or redirecting your connection and giving you the wrong files?\nThe package manager is telling you that it cannot trust/authenticate that the real source of the files you are getting.\nThe GPG errors are saying that the packages are telling you that the packages can be trusted to come from some person X (like the Wine development team), however it does not know that you trust person X yet. (Stuff still works because it is not told either way and so it cannot assume person X is bad).\nAdding the key says that you trust that person X (identified by the key ID, e.g. 40976EAF437D05B5 is for the official ubuntu archive). Normally, you can trust where it came from (gives the correct id), and as the ubuntu keyserver is used for ubuntu stuff and has basically the keys for everyone with a ppa you get the right key (identity). \n", "Q: How do I boot the live CD on a Macbook Pro?

Now I wonder how I'd create that file, when I can't access my /home/user folder, because it is encrypted. It also tells me on login that I should run encryptfs-mount-private.\n\nA: When you encrypted your user folder, you used the Ecryptfs program. Ecryptfs actually uses two different passwords to encrypt this folder. When you removed your login password, you needed to also change your Ecryptfs password. This protection exists to prevent root from tampering with the password of your encrypted directory.

I have an easynote tj65 (2.1 ghz dual core with Geforce GT240M) running Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 in dual-boot-mode.\nWhile Windows 7 doesn't have any comparable issues, Ubuntu is making my notebook warmer and warmer once the CPU-usage of all processes together gets higher than 50-60 percent, which happens as soon as I do anything more than simple browsing, e.g. starting and running banshee. After starting with no other processes running and (cpu-usage: ~1%) the temperature of both cores is at 61 degrees. \nOnce it got to 50 percent cpu usage it rises to around almost 90 for both cores  (gpu rises to the same level according to psensors).

A workaround for the Linux 3.0 kernel has been suggested:\nhttp://www.techytalk.info/linux-kernel-2-6-38-2-6-39-power-regression-workaround/\nI've heard that these issues were supposed to be fixed completely in Linux 3.1. However, Ubuntu 11.10 uses the 3.0 kernel, so the above workaround should still be relevant. According to Phoronix, the power consumption of Ubuntu 11.10 is up as much as 50%:\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTg5Mg\n\nA: Many new fixes and power management enhancements have gone into 12.04 / 12.10 and especially the new Nvidia drivers to handle your graphics power management that little bit better as well. Also by running Xubuntu you forego the 3D desktop environment for a 2D one which also helps reduce power usage levels.\n\nA: You can try to use the cpu-freq indicator app and force Ubuntu to to run at lower speeds.\nAdd this PPA: ppa:artfwo/ppa, and install the package indicator-cpufreq.\n\nA: You could try to open the terminal, then run\n$ gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nand in the line that says:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nchange it for:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi_osi=Linux quiet splash\"\n\nthen save and restart.

It needs you to upload the dsc file along changes and original tarball. Then the build system builds it in a clean chrooted environment\nHow did you build this tarball? You had the packaging directory which was debian/ directory? Right?\nThis is how I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unzip/untar an upstream tarball.

The first thing I noticed after upgrading from 11.04 to 11.10 is that my wallpaper changed to the one I used to have ages ago - probably before I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04. Which is not a big deal, of course, but:\nMy daughter used to experiment with Gnome themes in her account on the same machine - you know, bright-blue window backgrounds with yellow text etc. Later she changed the settings to something more usable. After the upgrade to Oneiric, the Gnome theme reverted to blue backgrounds with yellow text and I can find no way to reset it.\nI installed the \"Advanced settings\" tool and can change the theme there, but it looks like most of the themes fall back to some default settings for window and text colors - i.e. window decorations and other elements change, but the blue and yellow \"shine through\" the theme. Previously it was possible to edit the defaults but with the \"streamlined\" Gnome 3 UI I can't find where it is done.\nThe only theme which override the blue background is High Contrast theme - but it's just too ugly to be used.\nCan somebody explain what caused this \"time machine\" effect - the settings in question were last used many months ago and then changed via standard Gnome means.\nHow do I remove the theme customisations and roll back to the stock standard theme? \n\nA: Well, since nobody else wants to answer...\nI just stumbled upon the following question and I'm pretty sure the behaviour I experienced was caused by the settings being read from one config system but configuration tools changing the settings in another.\nJust to quote:\n\ndconf is a new way for applications to store settings, and it is\n  intended to replace gconf. dconf-editor and gconf-editor are for their\n  respective configuration systems, and they don't talk to each other.\n  At the moment that transition is still a work in progress, so many\n  applications continue to use gconf. In addition, some applications\n  still have settings left over in gconf even though they are using\n  dconf now.\nAlmost all of the software that is installed by default - everything\n  that comes from GNOME - uses dconf (if anything). Almost everything\n  else that is available uses gconf, though this is of course changing\n  as older software is brought up to date.\n\nIf I still had that system I would install gconf-editor and dconf-editor and poked around to see where the settings in question were stored. \n", "Q: Using NX with Unity in 11.10 I'm trying to use nx to login remotely to my desktop.

IMO this app should be part of a default Ubuntu installation. \n\nA: Just now I had a similar problem with one app. The problem with the accepted answer is that desktop files can be stored in many other locations, not only those listed, like this one ~/.kde/share/apps/RecentDocuments/, for example.\nSo I can suggest to use the find utility in such a case. One needs to figure out what string is guaranteed to be a part of the name of a desktop file for the app in question and that string should be quite long in order to avoid too much output.\nFor instance (\"iname\" stands for case insensitive name, * is a wildcard, it means any character(s) in place of it):\nsudo find / -iname '*tweet*'\n\nAlso one should try if necessary to search for some particular string in all desktop files on the system, like this:\nsudo find / -name '*.desktop' -exec grep -i '*tweet*' {} +\n\nThen remove all those found files and log off.\nThis should have helped the OP to remove those icons from the menu.\n\nA: Expanding on Severo Raz's answer : \n\n  \n*\n  \n*/usr/share/applications\n  \n*/usr/local/share/applications\n  \n*~/.local/share/applications\n\nyou can easily get it done using terminal, by : \n\n\n*\n\n*cd <directory>\n\n*ls | grep <application_name(\"tweet\")>\nWhich will give you an output like this : \napplication_name.desktop\n\nAnd then : \n\n\n*rm application_name.desktop\nActually, you should be able to combine step 3+4 : \nls | grep <appname> | xargs rm -f\n\n\nBe warned : You may delete desktop icons which you not intended to remove due to naming similarities etc. !

I am using this function:\nfunction test(){\n  local var=\"hello\"\n  PS1=\"\\u\\$$var\"\n}\n\nThe output I am trying to get from the function is john$hello.\nBut what I get is just john.\nIf I add a space before $var, then I do get close to what I want - but I do not want the space in there.\nIs it possible to do what I want without having that space? \n\nA: Since you've used double quotes when setting PS1, the variable substitution is evaluated at the point where you assign to the variable.  So you've ended up setting PS1 to \\u$hello.  The shell expands variables before displaying the prompt, and since you don't have any variable called hello, that part of the prompt expands to the empty string.\nIf you set PS1 using single quotes, the variable substitution will not be performed at that point.  This will cause the $var part to be evaluated when the prompt is shown though, which means it won't pick up the local variable you've defined in your shell function.\nThe third option that should work with a local variable from a shell function is to escape the meta-characters:\nPS1=\"\\u\\\\\\$$var\"\n\nThis should result in PS1 being set to \\u\\$hello.  The end of the prompt will not change when the variable var changes in this case.\n", "Q: How can I get in contact with an Ubuntu developer to help with a problem?

I tried disabling IPv6 and that also didn't help... but after some digging I found a reference to the /etc/nsswitch.conf file and changing the order of the \"hosts:\" line.\nOriginally, it was in the order \nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] wins dns mdns4\n\nI changed it so that dns came after files and after rebooting the difference was night and day - DNS lookups are much faster and websites load immediately instead of being stuck at \"Sending Request...\" in Chrome (or doing nothing in FF).\nhosts:          files dns mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] wins mdns4\n\nI'm not sure if this will affect anything else negatively but I haven't had any problems with it since - I am able to browse my local network and mount Windows shares without any problems at all.\nI hope this is helpful!\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Alternatively, does anybody know any good command line software that can pull tags from TheTVDB?\n\nA: The official repositories for Ubuntu 10.04 contain only Ruby 1.8, but it appears that you're using a manual installation of Ruby 1.9.1. When you install libopenssl-ruby using Ubuntu's package manager, libopenssl is installed for Ruby 1.8 within /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/, but you need it to be installed for Ruby 1.9.1 within /usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1/.\nHow you achieve this will depend on how you originally installed Ruby 1.9.1.\nIf you're not strongly attached to a particular method of installing Ruby, my suggestion is to reinstall it using the Ruby Version Manager (RVM), which is advocated on the official Ruby download page. Installing Ruby using RVM should include the required libopenssl library automatically.\nI recommend reading over the RVM installation instructions first (it's not as long as it looks—it's half examples), but this is probably all you'll need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dependencies for RVM:\nsudo apt-get install git curl\n\n\n*Install RVM:\nbash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer )\necho '[[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && . \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" # Load RVM function' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource .bashrc\n\n\n*Install dependencies for Ruby:\nScroll up (or run rvm requirements) and look for the line that says For Ruby … install the following:. Copy, paste, and run with sudo the apt-get install … line beneath it.\n\n*Install Ruby:\nrvm install 1.9.3\nrvm use 1.9.3 --default\n\nYou could install Ruby 1.9.1 here instead, but Ruby 1.9.3 is the current recommended version and should be compatible with nearly anything that works on other Ruby 1.9.x versions.\n\n*Install AtomicTV:\ngem install AtomicTV\n\n", "Q: Wiping \"swap\" partition I am trying to install Ubuntu 11.10. I partitioned between Windows and Ubuntu, with some free space left. I did not designate a \"swap partition.\" When I start installation, it gets stuck on this message: \"Wiping swap space for security.\" Since I do not have a swap space, this is not applicable. I have tried restarting the installation, to no avail. Help?\n\nA: My guess would be that you need to either add a swap partition, or kill off the incomplete install, so it can start again. You shouldn't have got that far, and maybe ought to file a bug on the installer - it should insist on a swap partition (it can be small).\nBoot from a live CD, and use the Disk Utility to re-partition your free space so there is something which can be used as swap. You will probably then need to add this to /etc/fstab on the main boot partition.\nYou need a line something like this:\n/dev/sdb5 none            swap    sw           0    0\nThis is fairly involved, and might not be quite as I've described, but it might be enough to get you going. Make sure you do not damage your Windows partition, or the boot sector of the drive. You might need to mount the Ubuntu partition first before you can edit fstab, and it might appear at media/drive_name/etc/fstab from the live CD.\n", "Q: Where is the Gnome-Shell Shutdown options My girlfriend is using Gnome-Shell (That traitor!! ^^) and she wants to know where is the options for Shutdown like in Unity (Another point for me and Unity hehe).\nHow can I add/find this option to help her.\nNOTE - If the option is not available then thats life.

Webupd8 offers the \"Alternative Status Menu\" extension which adds Power Off and Hibernate options to the menu permanently. \nEdit2: There is actually a site for gnome-shell extensions that provides some needed extensions.  The site is located here and there is an extension for an alternate menu that contains \"Power Off\" by default.  If you're running gnome-shell you can go there and just flip the switch from off to on and then confirm that you want to install the extension.\n\nA: install\ngnome-shell-extensions-alternative-status-menu\nusing synaptic package maneger or using terminal working for gnome 12.04.\n", "Q: Cannot startx, protocol not found Good afternoon,\nI cannot startx, I get an error \"Protocol not found\".\n(Ubuntu 11.10 x86_64 install was messed up after libjpeg was removed, had to reinstall ubuntu-desktop)\nIs there anything I can do to get this working again?\nThanks for all suggestions,\nAlec Taylor\n\nA: run sudo apt-get install libjpeg\npackages it might have uninstalled: compiz, unity, vino,\n", "Q: Changed motherboard, eSATA doesn't hot-swap Recently my file server suffered a hardware failure; long story short, I just finished putting a brand new motherboard, CPU, and RAM into it. And happily everything is working fine -- except the eSATA.\nSpecifically, the eSATA port doesn't seem to recognize when I unplug my drive, or plug in a different one. On the previous hardware, I could unplug the drive and watch its entry in e.g. /dev/disk/by-id/ disappear, and I could plug in a different drive and watch a new entry appear in the same directory.\nNow, however, I unplug the drive, and the entry doesn't disappear. I plug in a different drive, and there's no new entry, only the old one. Strangely, though, fdisk -l reads the new drive just fine; the issue, though, is that I have a backup script that relies on those drive IDs to find and mount the (encrypted) external backup drive.\nThe new motherboard is an ASRock 880G Pro3 sporting an AMD Athlon II X2 250. I have turned on AHCI mode for the SATA controller, and I've tried the \"AMD AHCI BIOS\" (although I have no idea what this actually is) both enabled and disabled, to no effect.\nIs there some recongifuration I need to do to the kernel, or to the package, to make it properly recognize these signals on the new hardware? Or some setting that I'm missing in the BIOS or something?\n\nA: Further tinkering has inadvertently lead me to the solution -- in addition to changing the SATA mode to AHCI, I had to also disable \"SATA IDE Combined Mode\"; I've also left disabled \"AMD AHCI BIOS ROM\", however I have not tested if that is necessary or not for proper detection of hot-swap events.\nSeems really odd to me that such a basic functionality as hot-swappable eSATA depends upon first finding the proper group of settings to enable and disable in the BIOS (wasn't necessary to tweak anything on my previous motherboard, it just worked right out of the box), but there it is.\n", "Q: Right bottom corner textbox in desktop; what's it for?

It could be as simple as using NFS or SMB to share a directory of ISOs or using iSCSI to forward a single ISO image.\n\n*KVM will let you use VNC to connect to the video anywhere. There's an up and coming protocol called SPICE  that should be more responsive and flexible than VNC though I haven't tried it yet.\n\n*Well, it's Windows.

Can this be right?\nHere's the 'Overview' output:\nSummary: 0.0 wakeups/second,  0.0 GPU ops/second and 0.0 VFS ops/sec\n\n            Usage Events/s Category Description\n         24.1 ms/s       0.0        Process        /usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin --plugin /usr/lib/flashplugin-\n         10.8 ms/s       0.0        Process        /usr/lib/firefox-7.0.1/plugin-container /var/lib/flashplugin-installer/npwrappe\n          9.3 ms/s       0.0        Process        /usr/bin/X :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch\n          7.7 ms/s       0.0        Process        powertop\n          5.2 ms/s       0.0        Process        /usr/bin/gnome-shell\n          3.4 ms/s       0.0        Process        /usr/lib/firefox-7.0.1/firefox\n          2.6 ms/s       0.0        Process        gnome-terminal\n          1.9 ms/s       0.0        Interrupt      [47] i915\n          1.9 ms/s       0.0        Timer          hrtimer_wakeup\n          1.7 ms/s       0.0        Process        /usr/lib/udisks/udisks-daemon\n [etc, etc]\n\nIdle stats as follows:\n          Package   |             Core    |             CPU 0               CPU 1\nPOLL        0.0%    | POLL        0.0%    | POLL        0.0%    0.0 ms      0.0%    0.0 ms\nC1-SNB      0.9%    | C1-SNB      1.2%    | C1-SNB      1.4%    0.4 ms      1.0%    0.4 ms\nC3-SNB      0.5%    | C3-SNB      0.7%    | C3-SNB      0.8%    0.6 ms      0.6%    0.6 ms\nC6-SNB      0.1%    | C6-SNB      0.1%    | C6-SNB      0.1%    0.6 ms      0.0%    0.8 ms\nC7-SNB     96.0%    | C7-SNB     94.5%    | C7-SNB     93.7%    3.0 ms     95.4%    5.2 ms\n\n                |             Core    |             CPU 2               CPU 3\n                | POLL        0.0%    | POLL        0.0%    0.0 ms      0.0%    0.0 ms\n                | C1-SNB      0.7%    | C1-SNB      0.6%    0.5 ms      0.7%    0.4 ms\n                | C3-SNB      0.3%    | C3-SNB      0.2%    0.2 ms      0.4%    0.5 ms\n                | C6-SNB      0.1%    | C6-SNB      0.0%    0.6 ms      0.1%    0.9 ms\n                | C7-SNB     97.4%    | C7-SNB     97.6%    6.3 ms     97.2%    7.1 ms\n\nFrequency stats show 0.0% for everything, and Device stats seem to have loads at 100%\n          Usage     Device name\n          5.7%        CPU use\n         86.7%        Display backlight\n         65.1%        Display backlight\n        100.0%        USB device: xHCI Host Controller\n        100.0%        USB Device: usb-device-8087-0024\n        100.0%        PCI Device: Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6230\n        100.0%        Radio device: Sony Notebook Control Driver\n        100.0%        USB device: EHCI Host Controller\n        100.0%        PCI Device: NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 Host Controller\n        100.0%        Radio device: iwlagn\n        100.0%        PCI Device: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I assume powertop is mis-reporting some things, right?  I'm running on a Sony Vaio, and they're notorious for being difficult hardware for linux...\n\nA: This appears to be a bug in PowerTop (I see the same behaviour on my Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit system).  It has already been reported in Launchpad:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/powertop/+bug/834725\nIf you're interested in tracking progress towards fixing this, I suggest subscribing to the bug report.\n\nA: I figured out that I needed an extra library, and there are some libraries there that I don't need, but I just pop them into the terminal just in case.  I made a little script that installs all these libraries, installs powertop 1.13 and runs it, but you will need to authenticate yourself at some point when it's running.  \nSimply copy and paste the following script into a text editor and save it with .sh at the end, e.g. PTopScript.sh, and run it in terminal with sh PTopScript.sh. Or if you do sudo sh PTopScript.sh, then I think it will remove the need to authenticate yourself.  By the way, I don't consider myself to be an experienced user of Linux, although I have tried a few different distros and can do basic things with the command line.  So if I have made a mistake, please forgive me. :)\nwget http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/download/powertop-1.13.tar.gz\ntar -xvf powertop-1.13.tar.gz\nsudo apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libncursesw5 libncursesw5-dev gettext\ncd powertop-1.13\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo powertop\n\n\nA: Thanks to James for pointing me towards the reported bug in the ubuntu packaged version.\nI downloaded the latest version, compiled from source, and things are looking more normal.

Hence some passwords will be Gt4@gj#k for example.\nNow to specify the system wide proxy settings (Why isn't this done more intuitively like for instance the way it was done in synaptic; and why is synaptic not included by default anymore either...) you have to use username:password@host in the host field for authenticating proxies.\nOur problem no is that some passwords have the @ sign in them so it breaks this simple system.\nHow can I employ a system wide proxy to work with apt and the system updater that allows real world passwords? \n\nA: If a program asks you to enter the proxy configuration as an http URL, you will need to follow the conventions for structuring URLs.\nAnd that means you can not include an @ character in the user name or password components unless you encode them.  Characters can be encoded in URLs as a percent sign followed by the hexadecimal representation of the code point.\nSo for the password Gt4@gj#k, you could represent it as Gt4%40gj%23k (the hash symbol is used to delimit the fragment portion of a URL, so it is best to encode it as well).\n\nA: Please check the below URL\nDuplicate question search before asking a question.\nApt-get with special character\n", "Q: How do I report a bug in te language support preferences?

First of all there are problems in configuring a static IP address. Just to explain @home I have a normal fiber ADSL and I use a DHCP. When I go to a customer I must insert a static IP address. With ifconfig everything seems ok but there is something wrong in searching DNS names. (I have installed Ubuntu and was going ok again). Now I Have reinstalled again Kubuntu 11.10 and I have the same problem in addition today I have discovered that if I connect to a network in another customer office the desktop freezes and I could only switch between windows with alt+tab. No FN key or right click to open run command works. So i unplugged network (configuration is just DHCP here) and tried on another position in office. It was the same. My Laptop freezes when connected, a fedora 14 of a friend works. So I decided to connect my Galaxy S II as USB network device. Everything is ok for like 3 minutes. When I noticed a little loss of signal again the desktop freezes and i must work (like now) just switching between windows with alt+tab).

Where should I append the correct root= option? If I don't get this Kernel to work, how can I remove it as the default and stick to the older one?\n\nA: You haven't provided much information with logs and such to proceed with but I am guessing most probably this error you're facing is because the kernel is confused by a IDE/SATA drive. Doing a quick Google search led me to link 1, link 2, link 3\nFollowing is the excerpt from a link referred to by one of the links above:\n\nMost likely one of the most occurring issue (but once you solved it,\n  you most likely are never going to see it again):\nUnable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)\n\nor\nVFS: Cannot open root device \"sda3\" or unknown-block(8,3)\nPlease append a correct \"root=\" boot option; here are the available partitions:\n  sda driver: sd\n    sda1 sda2\n\nThe digits 0,0 or 8,3 can be different in your case - it refers to\n  the device that the kernel tries to access (and which fails).\n  Generally speaking one can say that, if the first digit is 0, then the\n  kernel is unable to identify the hardware. If it is another digit\n  (like 8), it is unable to identify the file system (but is able to\n  access the hardware).\nThe problem here is that the kernel that you are booting cannot\n  translate the root=/dev/... parameter you gave it (inside the boot\n  loader configuration) into a real, accessible file system. Several\n  reasons can result in such a failure:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*the kernel configuration is missing drivers for your HDD controller    (cases 1, 4, 5)\n  \n*the kernel configuration is missing drivers for the bus used by your    HDD controller\n  \n*the kernel configuration is missing drivers for the file system you    are using\n  \n*the device is misidentified in your root= parameter (cases 2, 3)\n  \n  \n  Resolving the issue is easy if you know what the reason is. You most\n  likely don't, so here's a quick check-up.\nOpen the kernel configuration wizard (the make menuconfig part) so\n  that you can update the kernel configuration accordingly.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Check if you have built in (and not as a module) support for the bus    / protocol that your harddisk controller uses.\n  \n*Most likely this is PCI support, SATA support (which is beneath SCSI    device support), ...\n  \n*Check if you have built in (and not as a module) support for the HDD    controller you use.\n     One of the most frequent cases: you selected support for your    harddisk controller protocol (IDE, SATA, SCSI, ...) but forgot to\n  select the HDD controller driver itself (like Intel PIIX). Try\n  running the following lscpi command, and paste its output on\nhttp://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/. The site will show you which kernel \n  drivers you need to select for your system. Within the menuconfig,\n  you can type \"/\" to open the search function, and type in the driver\n  name to find out where it resides.\n     # lspci -n\n  \n*Check if you have built in (and not as a module) support for the file    system(s) you use.\n  \n*Say your root file system uses btrfs (which I definitely don't    recommend) but you didn't select it, or selected it to be built as a\n  module, then you'll get the error you see. Make sure the file system\n  support is built in the kernel.\n  \n*Check if the kernel parameter for root= is pointing to the correct    partition.\nThis isn't as stupid as it sounds. When you are booted with one\n  kernel, it might list your disks as being /dev/sda whereas your\n  (configured) kernel is expecting it to be /dev/hda. This is not\n  because kernels are inconsistent with each other, but because of the\n  drivers used: older drivers use the hda syntax, newer sda.\nTry switching hda with sda (and hdb with sdb, and ...).\nAlso, recent kernels give an overview of the partitions they found\n  on the device told. If it does, it might help you identify if you\n  misselected a partition (in the example given at the beginning of this\n  section, only two partitions are found whereas the kernel was\n  instructed to boot the third). If it doesn't, it is most likely\n  because the kernel doesn't know the device to begin with (so it can't\n  attempt to display partitions).\n  \n*Check if the kernel that is being boot by the boot loader is the    correct kernel.\n     I have seen people who, after building a first kernel (which doesn't    boot), forget that they have to mount /boot before the\n  overwrite the    kernel with a new one. As a result, they copy the\n  kernel to the root    file system (/) whereas the boot loader still\n  expects the kernel    image to be on the /boot partition.\n\n\nA: It's possible this error could be related to the initrd image being too large.\nA solution to this can be accomplished by changing the compression method and removing debug symbols from object files:\n# Strip unneeded symbols of object files\n$ cd /lib/modules/5.4.5-rt3  # or your new kernel\n$ sudo find . -name *.ko -exec strip --strip-unneeded {} +\n\n# Change the compression format\n$ sudo vi /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf\n# Modify COMPRESS=lz4 to COMPRESS=xz (line 53)\n\nCOMPRESS=xz \n\nreference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/59678390\n\nA: After reading this answer which explains what is going on, try using the [Boot-Reapir CD][1][1]: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nWorked great at repairing the \"the device is misidentified in your root= parameter (cases 2, 3)\".\n", "Q: Lenovo X120e only boots into windows after dual boot installation I possess a lenovo x120e laptop powered with AMD Fusion E-350 processor.

In Ubuntu 11.04 I usually edit my *.fig files by clicking on the icons. The application (script) which opened the file was texfig. This script was chosen by \"open with...\" in nautilus. But now there is no possibilities to choose other applications than the predefined ones appropriate to the mimetype. How can I define a default application (or a self made script) in nautilus for the x-xfig mimetype?\n\nA: For the less technical advanced users you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Thunar file manager from Xfce desktop environment (it will only install thunar, not the rest of xfce4):\nsudo apt-get install thunar\n\n(Alternatively, you can install the thunar package in the Ubuntu Software Center or the Synaptic Package Manager.)\n\n*Open thunar in the Terminal or through the applications menu / GNOME Shell / Unity / whatever and then use the Thunar file manager to set your filetype associations. Nautilus will respect these associations, too, the next time you click on that filetype in Nautilus.\n\nA: You need to specify a *.desktop file , place the file type you wanted to open.\nFirstly you need to get the mimetype of that file , e.g *.mkv\nuse:  mimetype /path/to/file to find it out\nXXXX.mkv:                      video/x-matroska\n\nNow you modify default assosiated application , in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list , create one if not found.\nMerge the following to that file:\n[Default Applications]\nvideo/x-matroska=mplayer.desktop;\n\nThis means you use mplayer.desktop to open all *.mkv files by default.\n(Create mplayer.desktop in /usr/share/applications, and point Exec= to you script`\nmplayer.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nExec=mplayer -ao alsa %f\nName=MPlayer\nNoDisplay=true\nIcon=gnome-mplayer\n\n\nA: If you're more GUI minded (like me), go to launchpad PPA and install Ubuntu-Tweak into your software repositories. As far as I and many others are concerned, it should be included in all distribution installation packages.\nOne of the 'tweaks' is Nautilus, where you can change your file associations as before, including anything in usr/bin.\nCheck it out at http://ubuntu-tweak.com/.\n\nA: You can create a .desktop file that will be listed on 'Open with other application' tab:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to ~/.local/share/applications\n\n*Create a file called textfig.desktop with these contents:\n\n\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Textfig\nComment=Edit fig files using custom textfig script\nExec=<path to your script> %u\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nIcon=\nCategories=Application;Utility;TextEditor;\nStartupNotify=true\nMimeType=text/plain;\nNoDisplay=true\n\n\nAfter this you will see Textfig in your Open with other application tab, select it and when you double click the file you will be able to open it using your program.\nJust adjust the rest of the values a bit more to fit your needs. The %u will tell nautilus to execute it on the currently selected file.\n\nA: I have cooked this little script to allow our users to open a file with a program of their choice.\nhttps://github.com/gecos-team/openwith\n\nA: *\n\n*Select the file that you want to change. \n\n*Choose File ▸ Properties.

Unfortunately, the migration crashed in the middle and only a small part of the old mails were correctly migrated.\nI know there's a backup of the old mails and I would like to restart the migration process. How can I do that? \n\nA: You can try by deleting all Evolution settings.\nFirst, make sure you have a backup copy of your user data from .local/share/evolution  \nNext, open Terminal and type:\nsudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/evolution/\n\nThis will delete all existing Evolution user data (like emails and address book).\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu version for PostgreSQL 9? For a database server that will be running in its own VPS:\nIs it better-supported to install the latest Ocelot 11.10 release with the standard package for postgresql9, or to install 10.04 LTS with the postgresql package from backports?\nAre there any stability or performance issues with either configuration?\nWhich one would be the easier upgrade path to the next LTS?\n\nA: I think it's better to keep your LTS installation and add a single package (group) from backports.  That way, you know exactly what you changed and can keep a close eye on it.  Otherwise you are running a whole operating system (hundreds or thousands of packages) on short-term or no support.\nThe stability of either configuration is probably the same, as far as PostgreSQL is concerned.  Of course, for the rest of the operating system, LTS is LTS for a reason.  Also, LTS to next LTS upgrades are probably better tested and supported than for some random intermediate release.\n", "Q: how to share movie file in ubuntu one file (Share With Me)? how to share movie file in ubuntu one file (Share With Me?) and how my friend get my movie file in ubuntu one (Share With Me) ?\n\nA: The person you are trying to share the file with has to have his pc synced to your Ubuntu-One account and than you would just add the file to the shared with me folder on your desktop and he will see it in his shared with me folder on the other side.

Does anyone know a program which will show me if there is any data coming in on a specific port and how much?\n\nA: A quick and dirty solution can be to use netcat:\nnc -l port-number\n\n-l for listening. May need admin privileges for listening on a port number lesser than 1024. Received data will be sent on stdout, so you may need redirection or piping to another command to use the data.\nAlso, the command should be active before some remote program connect to the port, otherwise the sending program will fail.\nFor more information, see netcat man page.\n\nA: Ettercap will do that for you and plus.\nInstall it with\n\nsudo apt-get install ettercap\n\n\n\nA: You might want to run a capture script under xinetd.  This can also log the connections coming in at start and/or end of the connection.\nYour capture script can do whatever you want it to do.  It can parse the data if you need or just count the size of the data transmitted.\n", "Q: Using Compiz by default in Unity 2D My hardware can handle Compiz fine, but not Unity 3D, annoyingly enough.

Let me ask by example, all referring to the home folder:\nthunderbird stores its files in .thunderbird\ngoogle chrome stores in .config/google-chrome\nrhythmbox is all over the place from .gconf to .local/share and .gnome2\nSo from what I see, ~/, .config,.gnome2, and .local/share seem to be serving the same purpose of storing user configurations and databases. Why is it so inconsistent?\nIt makes it a super nightmare if you want to share configurations between 2 operating systems like fedora and ubuntu or even two ubuntu versions like lucid and oneiric.\n\nA: Well, every distro will handle configurations the way they think its best, every distro will use the tools they find best for the job (ie dont tell any Arch Linux guy that you are going to create a GUI tool to handle the mirrors list! You will get a big reply saying \"THRERE IS ALREADY SEVERAL AND THEY ARE CALLED TEXT EDITORS\").\nIt just depends on the way of doing things and the package that was created for that distro. Packages are created to keep configurations here and there, they are not the same for the same package (they can be, but that's just coincidence).\nI agree it looks a bit messy but it would be a bit tricky (if not impossible) to convince everyone to adopt a common  place for all your configuration files.

EDIT I kinda answered my question with the help of this. The only question remaining is how to make the changes permanently stay in the pack-file and not be lost on reprofile. I'll leave the question open in case someone knows of a way (I'll accept that as an answer then). /EDIT\nI use my PC in a very similar fashion after boot: I'm using evince, chromium-browser, gmpc and gpodder most of the time. Now I want to cache those programs (at the expense of boot time if needed) using ureadahead.\nNow I looked at the contents of the ureadahead pack like this sudo ureadahead --dump|grep chromium and found only icons, .dekstop files and gconf key to be cached*.\nSo I was wondering whether there's a way to make ureadahead cache the binaries and libraries of my most commonly used programs as well and make them open in a snap after boot.\n*As far as I understood ureadahead doesn't really cache but rather keep a list of files and sorts them by inodes thus optimizing the access pattern but well...\n\nA: Maybe\nHmm - maybe the preload is the application what you are looking at \n:~$ apt-cache show preload\n\nDescription: adaptive readahead daemon\n preload monitors applications that users run, and by analyzing this\n data, predicts what applications users might run, and fetches those\n binaries and their dependencies into memory for faster startup times.\n .\n Note that installing preload will not make your system boot faster\n and that preload is a daemon that runs with root priviledges.\n\nHomepage: http://sourceforge.net/projects/preload\n\nFew Links\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/speed-up-your-linux-system.html\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/speed-up-your-system-with-preload-on-ubuntu-9.04\n\nA: I got it working thanks to this, but it's not a perfect solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the pre-stop exec sleep timeout in /etc/init/ureadahead.conf (last line) to something bigger depending on your boot time (I used 80 seconds). \n\n*Put the programs you want cached in autostart; for me that was totem gedit evince and gpodder. For convenience I added the prefix URA to find them more easily later for disabling (i.e. URA totem, URA gedit etc.).\n\n*Remove the old packfile sudo rm /var/lib/ureadahead/*.pack and reboot.\n\n\nWorks OK.

It is a tool for  secure \n  communications  and  data storage.  Data encryption and digital\n  signature creation can easily be performed through a GUI and Key \n  Management operations can easily be carried  out  through an intuitive\n  interface.\n\n(man 1 seahorse)\nIt should be enabled/running by default in Ubuntu and you should have this variable in your environment:\n$ echo $GPG_AGENT_INFO\n/tmp/keyring-XXXXXX/gpg:0:1\n\n/tmp/keyring-XXXXXX/gpg is a socket bound by the program gnome-keyring-daemon, which is found in the gnome-keyring package.\nUnfortunately, I don't have enough information about your system and I cannot tell you how to proceed exactly. However I should have given you enough information to start investigating the problem. If you need more help, please tell me whether you have the package installed, whether the process is running, whether the socket exists and whether the environment variable is set.\n\nA: I think on 11.10, installing seahorse-plugins should do this for you. And I think in 12.04 and newer versions, the gpg integration will be built-in. I used to have to install seahorse-plugins to make this work in older Ubuntu versions, but on 12.04 I don't have such a package installed, and the GPG integration is working fine for me.\n\nA: Gnome-GPG won't be avaiable for Ubuntu soon, but you can download the last builds that were made:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-gpg\n", "Q: Can't see any USB device in VirtualBox In Ubuntu 11.10 , i'm unable to see any USB device in VirtualBox , although i had the ext package installed , which is downloaded from oracle's site today.\n\nA: I also faced the same problem but I got the solution and it worked,\njust type this command\nsudo usermod -a -G vboxusers username\n\nFor further information follow the link\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#install-linux-host\n\nA: The most usual cause of this problem is that you have not added your user to the vboxusers group.\nNote that gnome 3 (what 11.10 uses) has removed the ability to add groups from their user management applet. See this question to use the old GUI tool or use the command line.\nYou will need to log-ou and log-in again to be able to use USB under VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Default route lost on reboot After upgrading to 11.10, my system is \"forgetting\" the default route to the internet every time the machine gets rebooted.  It \"remembers\" the route to the office (on a second NIC).  In my /etc/network/interfaces file I have both NICs configured as static and specify the IP, netmask AND gateway for each.  But the gateway for the external NIC is no longer being set at boot time (though it worked perfectly in 11.04). \nI'm wondering if it might be related to the \"waiting for network configuration\" problem that I and others seen.  Either way, I need a solution or at least a work-around.\nAs requested... route -v (after I manually added the eth1 default gateway, of course -- to see it before, imagine the eth1 gateway line missing):\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         216.199.48.57.n 0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth1\ndefault         192.168.42.1    0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 eth0\n192.168.42.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0\n216.199.48.56   *               255.255.255.248 U     0      0        0 eth1\n\n/etc/network/interfaces:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# Office network\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 192.168.42.4\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        gateway 192.168.42.1\n\n# Internet\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n        address 216.199.48.58\n        netmask 255.255.255.248\n        gateway 216.199.48.57\n\n\nA: By definition \"Default\" is a unique entity. The \"gateway\" statement sets the Default Gateway, thus is must be unique inside the file. This scenario requires you set a static route to your private network.

Or do I already have its maximum in my Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: You card needs to use the open source drivers that are not as fast as the ATI ones. Since ATI does not support your card anymore in Linux there is not much you can do.\nTaken from wiki.cchtml.com:\n\nRadeon (Catalyst Legacy & Open Source)\nATI/AMD dropped Catalyst support for these cards in Catalyst 9-4. These cards are supported with the legacy ATI 9-3 Catalyst release, but you MUST use a kernel 2.6.28 (or earlier) and Xserver 1.5 (or earlier). For example, you can use Catalyst 9-3 if you're running Ubuntu 8.04 or Debian Lenny/5.0. Open source support is good and 3D is still improving.\n\n*\n\n*RV530/RV560 Radeon X1600/X1650/X1700, M56, M66\n\n\nRunning your games with compiz disable (or using Ubuntu2D instead of the default Ubuntu desktop) will help but not by much.\nThink that is all you can try.\n", "Q: How do I get a Lexmark x4690 printer working?

Even when i open the file browser as admin i.e. sudo nautilus i can't create and change any file or folder. \nWhat might have caused this? Help me turn things back to normal.\n\nA: It sounds like you've accidentally changed the permissions of /etc/fstab. You should be able to use sudo because /var/run/sudo is mounted on the /var/run filesystem (or /run for Oneiric and up).\nFirst, make the root partition writable again:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\n\nNext, restore the permissions:\nsudo chown root: /etc/fstab\n\nAfter that, future boots should not make everything read-only.\n", "Q: Why does my touchpad fail on resume from standby?

I was hoping that if someone would translate the following for me, I would get a grasp of how to do this stuff. The GTK things itself seems to be fairly well documented, but I can't find anything about this. \n\n__gsignals__ = {'cell-edited' : (gobject.SIGNAL_RUN_LAST, gobject.TYPE_NONE,\n    (gobject.TYPE_PYOBJECT, gobject.TYPE_PYOBJECT, gobject.TYPE_PYOBJECT, \n    gobject.TYPE_PYOBJECT, gobject.TYPE_PYOBJECT)), 'selection-changed' : \n    (gobject.SIGNAL_RUN_LAST, gobject.TYPE_NONE, (gobject.TYPE_PYOBJECT,))}\nMy assumption was, since I couldn't find any specific documentation, that it would be a matter of changing the name of the constants, but I can't find any replacements. \n\nA: Think I've cracked the code after dir()-ing everything I could find in the GObject class =>\nG_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST is found in the GSignalFlags enum, which translates to GObject.SignalFlags.RUN_FIRST. This is consistent, so G_SIGNAL_MATCH_ID found in the enum GSignalMatchType translates to GObject.SignalMatchType.ID. \nNot entirely obvious, but easy enough once you know what to look for. \n\nA: As per previous comments, the translation you asked would be as follows:\nfrom gi.repository import GObject\n\n__gsignals__ = {'cell-edited': (GObject.SignalFlags.RUN_LAST,\n                                GObject.TYPE_NONE,\n                                (GObject.TYPE_PYOBJECT, GObject.TYPE_PYOBJECT, GObject.TYPE_PYOBJECT, GObject.TYPE_PYOBJECT, GObject.TYPE_PYOBJECT)),\n                'selection-changed': (GObject.SignalFlags.RUN_LAST, GObject.TYPE_NONE, (GObject.TYPE_PYOBJECT,))}\n\nHowever, according to my own experience, some python types are somehow internally mapped to their GObject counterparts (or at least, it works as if they were), that is, object is mapped to GObject.TYPE_PYOBJECT and None to GObject.TYPE_NONE. Hence, I find the following version more straightforward:\nfrom gi.repository import GObject\n\n__gsignals__ = {'cell-edited': (GObject.SignalFlags.RUN_LAST,\n                                None, (object, object, object, object, object)),\n                'selection-changed': (GObject.SignalFlags.RUN_LAST, None, (object,))}\n\n", "Q: RAID 1 array not found in server installer So I'm trying to install the last version of Ubuntu Server 11.10 64bits on my server ( replacing Windows Server 2008 completely ).\nSince I need more Sata ports, I bought a PCI Sata RAID Controller based on the chipset SiI3114.\nThe problem is that when I configure the array to RAID 1, when the installer gets to the point where I partition the disks, the RAID array simply doesn't appear on the list.\nThe installer asks me if I want to \"activate the Serial Ata RAID devices\", I choose yes, and nothing is listed.\nIf I instead of creating an RAID 1 array, create an Raid 0 array, it appears on the list to partition the disk.\nThis last part, is what I don't understand, it gets recognized when it is a RAID 0 array, but if it is a RAID 1 array it doesn't.\nI've read the FakeRaid wiki on ubuntu wiki, and also this post: RAID 10 not being found by installer\nRunning in RAID 1, and executing the shell on the installer and running the command dmraid -r, I get:\n/dev/sdb: sil, \"sil_bhbgdfdcfdfc\", mirror, ok, 976771072 sectors, data@ 0\n/dev/sda: sil, \"sil_bhbgdfdcfdfc\", mirror, ok, 976771072 sectors, data@ 0 \n\nLooks good I think.\nWhen in RAID 0, using the same commands, I get:\n/dev/sdb: sil, \"sil_bhbgdfdcfdfc\", stripe, ok, 976771072 sectors, data@ 0\n/dev/sda: sil, \"sil_bhbgdfdcfdfc\", stripe, ok, 976771072 sectors, data@ 0 \n\nEverything looks OK, I guess, it's the first time I'm installing Ubuntu Server for real, I've installed 4 or 5 times on VMPlayer to see how everything works.\nIf I don't configure an array, the disks are recognized with no problem whatsoever, if the PCI card, wasn't detected properly it wouldn't show any disks connected to the card in any instance I think. The card is also capable of RAID 5 and RAID 10, but I haven't tested that yet, later when I arrive home, I will see if the installer detects those RAID arrays.\nEDIT:\nSo I arrived home, and started googling again, and i found this, so I ran the command dmraid -ay:\nERROR: device-mapper target type \"mirror\" is not in the kernel.\nRAID set \"sil_bhbgdgaaaaba\" was not activated.\n\nThen I googled for this error, and what I found kind of scared me, this, basically all I have to do is recompile the Kernel with mirroring support, I can't recompile the kernel I simply don't have the knowledge to do it.. yet I mean..\nCan anyone give me a solution that doesn't involve recompiling the kernel?\nSecond edit:\nI just downloaded and burned an Ubuntu Live CD, and guess what? The RAID array is detected on the spot ( I'm currently installing Ubuntu in the RAID array ). Now I'm just plain confused, I tough the Ubuntu Server was a Ubuntu version but without an windows manager.\nThird edit:\nJust saved the syslog, to have more information to show:\nOct 24 22:46:43 anna-install: Installing dmraid-udeb\nOct 24 22:46:43 anna[10984]: DEBUG: retrieving dmraid-udeb 1.0.0.rc16-4.1ubuntu4\nOct 24 22:46:43 anna[10984]: DEBUG: retrieving libdmraid1.0.0.rc16-udeb 1.0.0.rc16-4.1ubuntu4\nOct 24 22:46:43 disk-detect: Serial ATA RAID disk(s) detected.\nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: Enabling dmraid support.\nOct 24 22:46:44 kernel: [   76.836245] device-mapper: table: 253:0: mirror: unknown target type\nOct 24 22:46:44 kernel: [   76.836248] device-mapper: ioctl: error adding target to table\nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: ERROR: \nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: device-mapper target type \"mirror\" is not in the kernel\nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: \nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: RAID set \"sil_bhbgdgdefacd\" was not activated\nOct 24 22:46:44 udevd[9332]: inotify_add_watch(6, /dev/dm-0, 10) failed: No such file or directory\nOct 24 22:46:44 kernel: [   76.931742] device-mapper: table: 253:0: mirror: unknown target type\nOct 24 22:46:44 kernel: [   76.931745] device-mapper: ioctl: error adding target to table\nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: ERROR: \nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: device-mapper target type \"mirror\" is not in the kernel\nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: \nOct 24 22:46:44 disk-detect: RAID set \"sil_bhbgdgdefacd\" was not activated\nOct 24 22:46:44 udevd[9332]: inotify_add_watch(6, /dev/dm-0, 10) failed: No such file or directory\n\nThanks\n\nA: Problem solved, all it took was my Portuguese ingenuity or \"Desenrascanço\". The uncanny ability passed down through the generations to solve any problem with merely a penny and a string. ( I didn't solve the problem with a penny and a string but you get the point ).\nSo here is the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect one of the disks to the motherboard, let's call source from now on.\n\n*Install Ubuntu Server on source disk.\n\n*Run sudo apt-get update\n\n*Run sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n*Install dmraid, by running sudo apt-get install dmraid\n\n*Put the modules dm-mod and dm-mirror inside the /etc/modules file, just sudo nano /etc/modules\n\n*Connect the source disk to the PCI card on the first SATA port, connect the other disk on any other port\n\n*Create the RAID 1 array. And boot the computer using the RAID array, it's going to boot, because one of the disks is bootable.\n\n*Confirm that the raid is running by issuing: sudo dmraid -ay, something on the lines of this should appear: \"*sil_bhbgdjddagcc: 0 976771072 mirror core 2 131072 nosync 2 /dev/sdd 0 /dev/sde 0 1 handle_errors.*\"\n\n*Disconnect the second disk ( the one that is not the source disk ).\n\n*Boot from the array again, and make a change to any file. Then shutdown.\n\n*Connect the disconnected drive and rebuild the array.\n\n*Wait a long time...\n\n\n...and if everything went well you should now have a running RAID 1 array on your server.\nHow did I check if the RAID 1 array was working? Just boot from each drive separately connected to the motherboard, if it boot's then it means that the rebuild was done correctly.\nAfter checking that the rebuild was done correctly you have to rebuild again. After finishing with this boot's and rebuilds, you just have to change one file on one disk while using the RAID 1 array, then shutdown, disconnect the disks from the array. \nThen boot from them separately and check for the change you made to that file is on both disks, if the changes are there, it means the RAID 1 array is working. Then it's time for another rebuild, and the system is ready to use.\nWhy do I have to rebuild the array every time I boot from one or another, because every time the server boots there are changes on the disks, that's why.\nThis solution doesn't work with another types of RAID arrays, RAID 5 should be a no go, because the data is spread across the disks, RAID 10, shouldn't work either because the data is stripped and mirrored, RAID 0 is not a problem because it's detected by the install.\n\nA: Im also portuguese and I have a much better solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu Server 11.04 which installs just fine on RAID 1 arrays\n\n*Do a do-release-upgrade after installation is complete.\n\n\nA few minutes later your system will be running Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: 1.) sudo lsmod\nCheck and see if the (dm_raid) module has loaded?\n2.) sudo dmraid -tay either of these commands work (sudo dmraid -ay)\nTest the raid array?\n3.) gedit /boot/grub/device.map and add \n(hd0) /dev/sda\n(hd1) /dev/sdb\n\n4.) gedit /etc/fstab comment out (/dev/mapper/sil_biabadbhagdc1) and  (/dev/mapper/sil_biabadbhagdc5) place a # in front of those lines.\nAdd your UUID's like so, you can use this command to get your UUID's (sudo blkid)\nMine looks like this:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid -o value -s UUID' to print the universally unique identifier\n# for a device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name\n# devices that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).\n#\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n# /dev/mapper/sil_biabadbhagdc1 \nUUID=\"01331dc5-0c78-49ab-9cf5-655b645110d2 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n#/dev/mapper/sil_biabadbhagdc5 \nUUID=\"ea62296d-27ef-4b59-8206-e89d7a31a844 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\n5.) sudo reboot and check your log files, keep in mind do not use the () in these commands.

I have added the connect and disconnect scripts to to /etc/network/if-up.d and /etc/network/if-down.d. \nThe script which starts at if-up works correctly, the other one not- it will simply not umount.

I'm personally using official Google Chrome, but you can get chromium from the PPA which is an open source project.\nFor some reason (some specific reasons actually, but is probably a bit out of scope for the discussion here) Firefox has always been somewhat problematic with laggy GUI issues on GNU/Linux-based systems. It's been improved over the years, and isn't very noticeable when you have a small number of tabs or first start, but it quickly gets out of hand in my experience, where I have several tabs open to Google applications and other \"Web 2.0\" web app kinds of things. I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to reboot or quit my browser and restart unless I have to, so the less leaky the browser, and the better it can recover from bad pages, the better.\nI wish I had a magic wand, but \"switch to Chrome or chromium\" is probably your best bet, honestly. It's still not perfect, but at the very least the UI is lightning-fast compared to Firefox and you can get an idea of what is eating all your memory and cpu by pressing shift+esc which lets you see a breakdown of what is in use by each tab.\nIt also helps to install Flashblock Chrome or something similar to keep ads and such from taking over your system resources.\n", "Q: How to share with a remote Windows user?

I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric) on a RAID stripe.\nIn order to install on a RAID I had to use the Alternate Installation (ubuntu-11.10-alternate-amd64.iso)\nI noticed off-the-bat that some applications that were in 11.04 are no longer in 11.10 like Synaptic Package Manager or Startup Applications (it's there, but shows an empty list...).\nHow come they are no longer there?\nI need to avoid downloading anything extra due to my limited internet connection (satellite). I have 500mb/daily @ 100Mb (6-60KB/s). On top of that, it is throttled from 1:00-20:00! On top of that... It took two days to retrieve the ISO.\nThe MD5 matches the ISO I downloaded so I think that tells me that nothing is missing...\n\nA: You noticed right. Some applications were removed from the CD installation in order to make room for some other apps. \nBut concider that you wont need Synaptic in 11.10 for normal use since the Ubuntu Software Center was greatly improved and has nearly all functionality Synaptic has (see here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter/SynapticSoftwareCenterComparison ) \nNew apps include Deja Dup, a powerful and easy-to-use back-up tool which I consider to me more useful for most users then Synaptic. \n\nA: Some applications have been removed due to incompatibility with GTK 3. For example Screen Ruler and TSClient just to mention a few. (Source)\nThe main difference though, until these applications start to support GTK 3, you cannot install them, in contrast to synaptic that is a single sudo apt-get install synaptic affair.\nAnother reason could be licensing changes.

As from now we will be using systemd, I'm writing a better script and info. on how to do that.\nBut is there a way?\nIs, there is a way. You just need to create a script that monitors your network state and restart Network Manager on demand. We will build this script and a systemd service that will be started with the system and will monitor your network status every 5 seconds to find if you are online or not.\nWhat should I do?\nFirst of all, we need to install the fping tool the make one of the connection tests (fping return \"is alive\" if a connection is possible and \"address not found\" if not):\n$ sudo apt-get install fping -y\n\nNow we will create the monitor script on our system. Create a file at /usr/local/bin/ called nm-watcher:\n$ sudo touch /usr/local/bin/nm-watcher\n\nAnd edit it using nano or your prefered text editor:\n$ sudo nano /usr/local/bin/nm-watcher\n\nCopy and paste this script inside the editor, save and close the file (if you are using nano, like in this tutorial, use \"CTRL+X\" \"Y\" and \"ENTER\" in sequence). Don't forget to change wlan0 to the interface that you want wm-watcher to monitor:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true; do #create a infinite loop to keep looking at your connection\n        NET=$(ifconfig wlan0 | grep \"inet inet addr:\") # verify if the interface has an assigned IP\n        ROUTE=$(fping google.com 2>&1 | grep \"alive\") # try to ping google.com and verify if we have any response\n        WEB=$(wget --tries=10 --timeout=20 --spider http://google.com 2>&1 | grep \"OK\") # spiders google.com to verify if the page exists. returns error if a connections is not possible\n\n        if [ ! \"$NET\" != \"\" ] || [ ! \"$ROUTE\" != \"\" ] || [ ! \"$WEB\" != \"\" ]; then # verify if any of the above conditions aren't OK\n                service network-manager restart\n        fi\n\n        sleep 5\ndone\n\nTo run this script we need to make it executable:\n$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/nm-watcher\n\nNow, we will create the SystemD service, for this, you should create and edit the nm-watcher.service file at /etc/systemd/system/:\n$ sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/nm-watcher.service && sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nm-watcher.service\n\nAnd put this content inside the file:\n[Unit]\nDescription=NetworkManager Watcher\nWants=NetworkManager.service\nBefore=NetworkManager.service\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/nm-watcher\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nThis will create the service file that make SystemD call the script that we have created before at every boot, after we have estabished a connection using network-manager.service.\nWe should know enable this service to run using:\n$ sudo systemctl enable nm-watcher.service\n\nAnd start the service by typing:\n$ sudo service nm-watcher start\n\nTo verify if the service is running type:\n$ sudo service nm-watcher status\n\nIf you have any problems with the service, you can see the debug messages using:\n$ sudo journalctl -u nm-watcher\n\nShould I do any other things?\nNo, this is all what is needed to accomplish this task. This script has very low impact at the system performance, like you can see at this screenshot:\n\n\nA: On my older laptop I had a bad WiFi card which had a tendency to disconnect from the WiFi if there was a lot of load (e.g., downloading large files, etc.). \nI created a simple script to check if my internet was still connected, and if it wasn't, then restart the network manager. \n#!/bin/bash\n\nping -c 1 8.8.8.8\nreceived=$?\necho $received\nif [[ $received -ne 0 ]] ; then\n    service network-manager restart\nfi\n\nI created a root cronjob with sudo crontab -e, and set it such that every minute (you can do it more less frequently, but the script is a simple ping so it isn't resource intensive) it would run the script.\nSo, if my WiFi did go out for some reason, it would only ever be out for about a minute at a time, tops.

I'm running with a laptop and an external screen and in boot and login they're mirrored and has a weird resolution. \nTo clarify: I'm using my laptop with an external screen, with my laptop to the right and the screen in front of me. I've set it up as an extended desktop (is that right?). But it's not like that on the login screen, there, my screens are mirrored and has a weird resolution, way bigger than it should be. Does that make any sense?\nWhen logged in, my external screen is the \"main\" window, where the top bar is and so on.

So, at login I would like the same.\nCan I fix this?\n\nA: The login screen in 11.10 uses the default X behaviour for multi-monitors.  In most cases this is mirroring, but various drivers can behave incorrectly (e.g. incorrect resolutions or not working second monitors).  We have this in 11.10 as the original solution of managing the monitors like the session does had more problems.\nThis feature is planned to be revisited for 12.04 to make the experience better.

Now I want to create a NTFS partition for Windows XP and install Windows XP to get dual operating systems. How should I go about doing this ? How to create the partition in Linux? I am new to Linux..Can anyone please help me ? \nThanks\n\nA: You're going to have to boot from a live CD, run sudo gparted, resize your Ubuntu partition for room for XP, then [optional] create a NTFS for XP.  [Edit: If you're a total n00b, here is a link to a gparted tutorial: http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gparted.html ] :)\nThen you boot from the XP cd, select the partition [or if you didn't create one, tell it to use unallocated space].\nOnce that installs, you are going to have to reinstall the GRUB bootloader.  If you have grub legacy, I know how. If you have grub-pc [the new one, aka grub 2 I think], I'm not exactly sure how, but a quick google search should tell you.\nTo reinstall the bootloader you again will have to boot from a live CD and run some commands on the terminal.  \nFor legacy grub:  sudo install-grub /dev/sdX\nAnd you may want to run sudo update-grub, [But you probably should backup /boot/grub/menu.cfg first] and hopefully it will find your XP installation and add it to the menu.  If not you will have to manually edit /boot/grub/menu.cfg.  sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.cfg \nIf GRUB finds your windows XP automatically, you're done.\nFind the part where it mentions chainloading, [it's commented out] and copy that part, and paste it next to your Linux entries.  Then just replace the \"root (hd0,0)\" line:  hd0 means the first disk [sda], the next 0 means the first partition. So if your XP partition was /dev/sda4, your line would look like \"root (hd0,3)\" because the number starts at 0, not 1.\n", "Q: Is there a package of Rawstudio 2.0?

VNC is painfully slow with Haiku OS guest, Spice won't install and SDL doesn't work I've been coming up to speed on the Haiku operating system, an Open Source clone of BeOS 5 Pro.\nI'm using an Apple MacBook Pro as my development machine.  Apple's BootCamp BIOS does not support more than four partitions on the internal hard drive.  While I can set up extended and logical partitions, doing so will prevent any of the installed operating systems from booting.  To run Haiku directly on the iron, I boot it off a USB stick.  Using external storage is also helpful because I am perpetually out of filesystem space.\nWhile VirtualBox is documented to allow access to physical drives, I could not actually get it to work.  Also VirtualBox can only use one of the host CPU's cores.  While VB guests can be configured for more than one CPU, they are only emulated.  A full build of the Haiku OS takes 4.5 under VB.  \nI had the hope of reducing build times by using KVM instead, but it's not working nearly as well as VirtualBox did.  The Linux Kernel Virtual Machine is broken in all manner of fundamental ways as seen from Haiku.\nBut I'm a coder; maybe I could contribute to fixing some of those problems.\nThe first problem I've got is that Haiku's video in virt-manager is quite painfully slow.  When I drag Haiku windows around the desktop, they lag quite far behind where my mouse is.  It's quite difficult to move a window to a precise position on the screen.  Just imagine that the mouse was connected to the window title bar with a really stretchy spring.\nAlso Haiku's mouse lags quite far behind where I have moved it.\nI found lots of Personal Package Archives that enable Spice from QEMU / KVM at the Ubuntu Personal Package Arhives.  I tried a few of the PPAs but none of them worked; with one of them, the command \"add-apt-repository\" crashed with a traceback.\nThere is a Wiki page about Spice, but it says that it only works on 64-bit.  My Early 2006 MacBook Pro is 32-bit.  Its Apple Model Identifier is MacBookPro1,1; these use Core Duos NOT Core 2 Duos.\nI don't mind building a source deb for 32-bit if I can expect it to work.  Is there some reason that Spice should be 64-bit only?  Does it need features of the x86_64 Instruction Set Architecture that x86 does not have?\nWhen I try using SDL from virt-manager, the configuration for Local SDL Window says \"Xauth: /home/mike/.Xauthority\".  When I try to start my guest, virt-manager emits an error.\nWhen I Googled the error message, the usual solution was to make ~/.Xauthority readible.  However, .Xauthorty does not exist in my home directory.  Instead I have a $XAUTHORITY environment variable.  There is no way to configure SDL in virt-manager to use $XAUTHORITY instead of ~/.Xauthority.  Neither does it work to copy the value of $XAUTHORITY into the file.\nI am ready to scream, because I've been five fscking days trying to make KVM work for Haiku development.  There is a whole lot more that is broken than the slow video.\nAll I really want to do for now is speed up my full builds of Haiku by using \"jam -j2\" to use both cores in my CPU. \nI may try Xen next, but the last time I monkeyed with Xen it was far, far more broken than I am finding KVM to be.\nJust for now, I would be satisfied if there were some way to use my USB stick as a drive in VirtualBox.  VB does allow me to configure /dev/sdb as a drive, but it always causes a fatal error when I try to launch the guest.\nThank You For Any Advice You Can Give Me.  - \n\nA: Well, you said yourself:\n\nAll I really want to do for now is speed up my full builds of Haiku by using \"jam -j2\" to use both cores in my CPU.\n\nand in response to the bug you filed with the haiku project\n\nChanged 3 months ago by bonefish\nOne question that comes to mind: Why do you want to punish yourself building Haiku on an emulated Haiku? On your Linux host system Haiku can be built a lot faster than on a Haiku installed on the same machine. And an emulated Haiku is dramatically slower even. When you work on individual libraries or applications, building on an emulated Haiku might make sense, but the more has to be built the better are the turn-around times for building on Linux. For kernel or driver work that doesn't need actual hardware, it's the best option anyway.\n\nUsing a completely emulated VM as a build server is going to be painfully slow, there's just no getting around it. For you to actually assign a harddisk to the\nguest would require VT-D extensions. So in your limited laptop setting, you might\nbe able to install a expresscard sata controller and attach an external disk. Then assign the entire bus to the VM, that's predicated on having VT-D though.\nYou're on the pointy tip of the spear, running an experimental OS with no guest\ndriver support. If were to contribute a set of virtio drivers to haiku it would\nreally speed things up.\nThere has to be a better developer workflow than what you've proposed. I'm sure\nthe lead developers cross-built all the time before the OS was bootstrapped. There\nare haiku irc channels and developer FAQs, I suggest that you start there. Good luck.\n", "Q: Correct settings for nVidia current driver to make work dual monitor setup as extended desktop (not twinview) I have an Asus 22\" widescreen monitor with resolution: 1680x1050, and another Samsung 19\" with resolution: 1280*1024.\nI use my Asus as primary display, and want to use my Samsung monitor as streched desktop, but when I activate the secondary display, it works only in twinview mode (it works correct).

I issued a command in the Ubuntu terminal that required me to type yes but I discovered that it only asks me the first time, but I had already pressed enter before I realized.  So I expected a \"command not found\" message but instead I got a never-ending stream of \"y\"s.  This seems to be the only thing this does, so I'm wondering what the point of this command is and why it outputs \"y\"s?

If\n  the info and yes programs are properly installed at your site, the\n  command\ninfo yes\n\nshould give you access to the complete manual.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the usage of a \"yes\" command sounds logic when you have to repeatedly authorize something in a process/script by pressing the \"y\" key. Which can be controlled by cancelling the program execution.\nAnyway, somebody else may have experience using this command.\n\nA: A long time ago (SySV days and earlier), the fsck command did not have -y or -n options.  The command would interactively ask you to change hundreds or thousands of items, expecting a 'y' or 'n'.  The yes command was created to pipe to fsck, and some other programs to be able to repeated answer the interactive questions (again, this was SysV days, long before Tcl and Expect).  The yes program fit very well with the UNIX philosophy: small programs that do specific things very well and work with other programs.\n\nA: From wikipedia:\n\nBy itself, the yes command outputs 'y' or whatever is specified as an argument, followed by a newline repeatedly until stopped by the user or otherwise killed; when piped into a command, it will continue until the pipe breaks (i.e., the program completes its execution).\nIt can also be used to test how well a system handles high loads, as using yes results in 100% processor usage, for systems with a single processor (for a multiprocessor system, a process must be run for each processor). This, for example, can be useful for investigating whether a system's cooling system will be effective when the processor is running at 100%.\n\n\nA: The yes command will either print its argument, or \"y\" if that is empty, until you end the program or its output pipe is closed. It can be used with programs that expect some repeated input, like rm -i.\n", "Q: USB printer works only with one notebook I have an HP LaserJet P1005.

I am doing a school project and I want to give a tutorial regarding file permissions.\nI am using vmware workstation and when I go on Sales permissions and try to set a file permission, it will return to -.\nAlso, I cannot tick to execute the file as a program :S...\nWhen I try to do so the tick will also automatically vanish.\nThis is rather strange but don't know what is going on.\n\nA: Open a terminal, and to give the executive flag, do this :  \nchmod +x a.sh\n\nwhere a.sh is the file that you want to be executable.\nTo change read, or write permission, do this:  \nchmod -r a.sh # make it non-readable\nchmod +r a.sh # make it readable\nchmod -w a.sh # make it non-writeable\nchmod +w a.sh # make it writeable\n\nAs every file belongs to a user and belongs to a group, you can be specific to user, group or everybody prefixing the permission option with the letters u, g and o respectively. So you could:\nchmod g+w a.sh # make it writeable by the group a.sh belongs\nchmod o-w a.sh # make it non-writeable by others than the user and the group a.sh belongs\nchmod g+w,o-w a.sh # The same as the two lines before, but in one line\n\nFor more options, check man chmod\n\nA: to remove read write and execute permissions \n% chmod go-rwx (file name)\nTo give read and write permissions (all file)\n% chmod a+rw ur filename\n\n\n   \n    Symbol\n    Meaning\n  \n   \n    u\n    user\n  \n   \n    g\n    group\n  \n   \n    o\n    other\n  \n   \n    a\n    all\n  \n   \n    r\n    read\n  \n   \n    w\n    write (and delete)\n  \n   \n    x\n    execute (and access directory) \n  \n   \n    +\n    add permission\n  \n   \n    -\n    take away permission\n  \n\n\n\n\nA: Please clarify.

Or on the Host/Network, etc.?\nLast but not least, Do you own the folder? Only the owner (or root) can change the permissions on a file or folder.\n\nAlso to expand on Vjo's answer.\nThe instructions he gave you will apply the permissions 'across the board' to the user, group and all others. If you want to be more specific as to who you are applying the permissions to you can also use u, g + o to assign those rights to the user(u), the group(g), or others(o)\nFor example:\nchmod u+x filename\n\nWould add execute permissions to the 'filename' file for the user only.\nIf you wanted to add write(w) permissions to the user(u) and group(g), then you could use:\nchmod ug+w filename\n\nPlus(+) adds the permission, Minus(-) removes the permissions, and Equal (=) sets the permission.\n", "Q: How can i use apt-get install without interrupting?

Is this the correct way you do it in Ubuntu?\n# Auto Login for Ubuntu how?\n# 1. apt-get install mingetty\n# 2. vim /etc/init/tty1.conf\n\n# tty1 - getty\n#\n# This service maintains a getty on tty1 from the point the system is\n# started until it is shut down again.\nstart on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\nrespawn\n#exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1\nexec /sbin/mingetty --autologin <PUTYOUR_USERNAME_HERE> tty1\n^\n|____ edited only this line, seems to be working \n\n\nA: On my xubuntu 11.10 system, the default runlevel was set in /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf - the line in question read env DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=2. So I created a /etc/init/rc-sysinit.override, and put in it one line that reads env DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=5, so now my default runlevel is 5.\n\nThen I created a /etc/init/lightdm.override (or gdm.override, or kdm.override, whatever the case may be for whatever display manager you're using), and copied all of the start and stop items from lightdm.conf - and just changed the runlevel bits so my display manager starts in runlevel 5, and stops in other runlevels.\n\nA: There is no /etc/inittab in Ubuntu, because Ubuntu uses upstart to define startup services and runlevel. And this has not started from the last release of Ubuntu, but a long time ago.\nAnyway, you can still use inittab, simply create one. I report a passage from /usr/share/doc/upstart/README.Debian.gz:\n\nHow do I change the default runlevel?\n-------------------------------------\n\nIf you have an /etc/inittab file, edit it.  Locate the following line:\n\n    id:N:initdefault:\n\nWhere N is the default runlevel, change this to match.\n\nMost people won't have that file, you can edit /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf\nand change the following line:\n\n    env DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=2\n\n\nbut bear in mind that Ubuntu do not use standard runlevel meaning as other linux distros/unix os. Old standard was:\n\n\n*\n\n*0 - shutdown\n\n*1 - single user mode\n\n*3 - multiuser text mode\n\n*5 - multiuser graphical mode\n\n*6 - reboot \n\n\nbut Ubuntu uses:\n\n\n*\n\n*0 - shutdown\n\n*1 - single user mode\n\n*2 - multiuser graphical mode\n\n*6 - reboot \n\n\nFinally, if you want to have a virtual terminal with automatic login, then modifying the exec line in tty1.conf seems the correct way, though I do not know mingetty, so cannot say if you used it correctly.\n\nA: I unclear as to what and where the \"this\" you have posted is supposed to be. Regardless however, Upstart will still parse /etc/inittab if it exists, I'd suggest putting non-runlevel related stuff into it just as you did before.\n", "Q: Is it possible to play imm4-codec videos?

I have these problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I want to write someone a message I have to manually start empathy with a right click and selecting \"New window\" because otherwise it only focuses an already open chat window instead of opening the roster. Alternative is searching for the name in the just-type search, clicking the found user and then clicking the chat button. This is all to complicated. In previous gnome versions I could simply click the IM icon in the tray to open the roster. What is the supposed way to do this now in gnome shell?\n\n*When someone writes me a message then this message is shortly displayed at the bottom of the screen. That's nice when I'm in front of the screen and notice it. But when I don't notice this notification then it is minimized into this notification area which isn't visible by default. So I have to check manually if a new message has arrived. In previous gnome versions I had a blinking IM icon in the tray which CONSTANTLY notified me about a new message. How is that supposed to work in gnome shell now?\nUnity has a message indicator which displays a colored icon when a unread message is waiting. This isn't ideal but better than nothing. It also allows me to open the roster window in the context menu. How can I achieve something similar with Gnome shell?\n\nA: For your first question, you have a few options. First, you can open a new instance of any application by middle clicking. It will open in a new workspace, and once you close it you'll land back where you were.\nIf you install the application called gnome-contacts, you can search for your contacts from the overview. (Unfortunately, gnome-contacts doesn't sort by status at the moment, so that isn't ideal).\nFor your second question, you can get Empathy to always open chats in new windows. Open Empathy, go to Edit›Preferences in the menu and uncheck “Display incoming events in the notification area.” It's a little counter-intuitive, but what that does is your new messages will still appear in the message tray but their corresponding windows will open immediately.\n\nA: You can find the \"short popup messages\" for chat and apps requests at the bottom of right corner (tray).\n", "Q: 32 and 64 bit on one live USB stick I have successfully created a bootable Live USB stick on an 8Gb drive with either the 32 and 64 bit version of 11.10 but not bother at the same time.

I would like to make a launcher that directs an application to be opened in a terminal. \nI had it on Maverick and it worked. And also, it added the application to the 'Installed applications'.\nAt this moment, on 11.10 I can only make the desktop launcher. If I move it to the Unity launcher, it creates a permanent launcher item, and it's not included in the 'Installed Apps' list as well.\nDoes anybody have a solution?\n\nA: Graphical method\nTo create launchers that lets you open applications in terminal, you can try alacarte. \nFirst of all, you need to have alacarte  installed.              After installing it, open alacarte. On the right side, there would be an option to create a New item. Click on it. \n\nWhen you click the button, a dialog box of title Create launcher would appear. For the option Type, choose Application in Terminal. Give appropriate name to the launcher item and the actual command to execute and so on. After that, click OK and that would save the launcher item. \n\nNow, search for the launcher in the dash and then pin it to your launcher. Clicking on the launcher item would now open the application in terminal. \n\nNote: There is a good chance that you might actually end up pinning the original launcher item which doesn't open in a terminal. So, good luck on pinning the correct launcher item.\nCommand-line method \nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/minitube.desktop\n\nHere /usr/share/applications/minitube.desktop is an example I used. You can use the exact path to the file that you want to edit.\nChange the line Terminal=false to Terminal=true. If there is no such line, then add one: Terminal=true.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to edit files in a terminal with nano?\n\nA: I don't really understand, but I'll have a go anyway. If you mean you want to open a new terminal window and run a command in it, then that's easy. And if you've managed to create the .desktop-file, then you can just copy it to ~/-local/share/applications to make it available in the dash. You can then drag it to the launcher and keep it there if you want to. \nAnother solution that might be interesting to you, is to add the commands to the terminal quicklist. You can see an example of that here: What Custom Launchers and Unity Quicklists are available?\n", "Q: Wont boot from USB, stops at SYSLINUX copyright Created bootable 11.10 in Windows from Universal USB Installer 1.8.6.8, upon boot in my HP Mini Netbook it displays only this:\nSYSLINUX 4.04 EDD 2011-04-18 Copyright (C) 1994-2011 H.

(Re: can't install with usb pen drive, SYSLINUX problem)\nI also tried creating a bootable USB using unetbootin-windows-563, no change.\nDoes anybody have any other ideas?\n\nA: I was having this same issue trying to install Ubuntu on my 2008 HP laptop. Make sure USB is formatted FAT32 or NTFS first. I actually tried both with no success. I also tried a few different Linux distros and multiple Linux USB creators. All gave me the same message on boot.

I could not get it working. I have the notebook plugged into the docking station with two monitors attached (one via VGA one via DVI). The same setup works pretty well with Windows 7. Any thoughts?\n\nA: I have this working, although it's worth noting that I have the Intel integrated graphics. If I boot with the laptop docked, I get the login screen replicated on both monitors, although not at the correct resolution. Once I log in, nine times out of ten, the left-hand DVI monitor goes blank but the right-hand VGA monitor is fine and at the correct resolution.\nThe only way I've found of waking up the left-hand monitor is to go to Displays and temporarily disable the left-hand monitor; specifically, I disable it and then click the \"restore previous settings\" button. Because the Displays window is necessarily on the right-hand monitor, when dropping to a single monitor, it gets moved one virtual desktop to the right -- that took a while to discover!\nAside from this, a suspend-undock-wake sequence completely and irretrievably corrupts the display on the laptop screen.\n", "Q: The GNOME Terminal is very slow in GNOME 3 When using the GNOME Terminal, if I try to create a new tab, or use \"C+tab\" to cycle to a new one, the terminal will take up to five full seconds to change. This seems to occur whether using ZSH or Bash. Has anyone run into this issue? Or, does anyone know how to get debugging information from this?\n\nA: I have the exact same problem.  It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen a majority of the time and I hate it.  Also, text prints very slowly in the terminal.  So if I print out a large number of characters, the terminal spits it out in jumps and increments.  It's very laggy.  This is a major issue.\nUPDATE: I press alt-f2, then hit \"r\" to reset Gnome.  Your session remains intact, but it reboots Gnome, and then my terminals work very nicely...so this is a memory leak or bug in Gnome.\n\nA: I have not experienced this issue.\nYou may want to try an alternative terminal emulator such as xterm or uxterm.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators#X_Window_Terminals\n\nA: Do you use NVIDIA drivers? Then you might be affected an bug in the driver. The new 295.20 release states a potential fix:\n\nFixed a bug that could cause some OpenGL applications (including desktop environments like KDE and GNOME Shell) to hang.\n\nEDIT: An more in-depth discussion if found at: https://askubuntu.com/questions/78237/unity-3d-with-nvidia-driver-becomes-very-slow-and-laggy\n\nA: I have found terminator, my favorite term, has the same problem creating or switching tabs. It makes Gnome 3 unusable. I usually have somewhere in the range of 4 or 5 tabs of console open with each one possibly split many times. Sometimes creating new tabs causes the entire Gnome 3 UI to freeze, and the only way to get back in is restart gdm from one of the actual consoles (ctrl+alt+f1)\n\nA: GNOME terminal is also slow for me. From the Wikipedia list the fastest of what I tested was evilvte. That one seems to go all the way to the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of leaving out as many features as possible. (Whereas I sense that GNOME terminal chooses to be quite featureful.)\nThe other fast alternative for me is to use the virtual terminal. If you hit any of Ctrl+Alt+F6 through Ctrl+Alt+F1 you will get a minimal, quick console interface. Striking Ctrl+Alt+F7 returns you to the usual graphical interface with windows and such.\nCombining those virtual terminals with tmux (a GNU screen replacement) has been helpful for me. In tmux it's Ctrl+b, Ctrl+c to open a new window, Ctrl+b, Ctrl+% to split the screen into two frames, each with its own terminal interface, and Ctrl+b, Ctrl+x to close a frame.\n", "Q: How do you turn of the touchpad when typing to avoid the cursor jumping around? It is nearly impossible to type on my Dell Latitude because the cursor jumps around anytime I get close to the touch pad.  There is not a setting to inactivate it during typing.  I am using Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: I use the Touchpad-Indicator; I have it set as a startup application in Ubuntu, and it's set to turn off the touchpad.\nI'm using Unity, and first had to turn on the notification area (you don't have to leave it showing there after you've set it up, but it's a convenient tool to have for turning the touchpad back on):\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\n\nThis allows the indicator to show in the panel.\nThen install the indicator:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install touchpad-indicator\n\nIt works great for me with my Dell Studio.\n\nA: This should be asked in superuser. It's typically a fn key for that in every laptop. In my case is fn f9 but yours could be other one. Just look for the key with symbol that symbolize the touchpad, maybe in blue collor or orange or any other color different that the characters colors.\n\nA: I've had the same problem on 2 different laptops on Lubuntu. Neither has a fn key for toggling the touchpad on+off.  I found this script, which I would like to attribute properly to the author or source, but I've unfortunately since lost the reference to the source.

This way I can have one company image that runs everywhere I work in.\n\nA: I've never used Clonezilla but looking at the boot parameters here I would say you just need to make sure that ocs_live_batch=\"no\" so that your script is interactive and then you should be able to use something like this in to read input from the terminal.\n", "Q: Can I collapse the \"Shortcuts\" area in the Dash?

After about two days of using this new version the Dash didn't appear on the top, and I wasn't able to access the programs that I use.  Let me describe:\nThe bar on the top with the clock and Internet connections is not there.  The only remains are the notification messages that a connection has been found, which allows me to connect to the Internet; and the menus from what appear to be a nautilus application but I'm not sure, they read File Edit View Go Bookmarks Help, and they open my Home Folder. \nThe icons of my favourite applications are not there, and I am unable to access them wit Alt+F2 or the Super key.  The only thing that's available is the Terminal with the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T. \nBy the way, in order to keep using the computer I had to run the Ubuntu 2D version at the beginning, but as you would imagine that is not optimal since I was already looking forward to the new features of Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, which should reinstall all of Unity's features.\n\nA: \n[from the original question asker]\n\nIt turns out I accidentally uninstalled the Unity plugin in CompizConig Settings Manager.

Since Oneiric, if I leave my machine (HP Mini 110 netbook) unattended and it goes into power-save mode, the backlight gets disabled. How can I turn it back on? Note that the keyboard backlight controls (Fn+F4 and Fn+F3) don't have any effect in this situation.\nI've already filed a bug, but filing a bug doesn't fix my problem. I tried this workaround posted in this bug report dealing with Acer laptops:\nsudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=0\n\nHowever, if anything, that command makes things worse. In the general case, I can see a little bit if I'm in a dark room with a flashlight aimed just so. But after running setpci I can't see anything. And I find the setpci documentation to be utterly incomprehensible, so I don't know whether I need to tweak my command somehow or whether I'm completely barking up the wrong tree.\nUpdate:\nI've found a workaround: I'm now booting with the kernel parameter acpi=off. This disables power management, which prevents the machine from going into power saving mode and thus failing to come back up correctly. Of course, not having power management means that I can't use suspend or do anything to manage power other than powering it off (even then, I have to manually use the power switch). Also, it prevents me from using Unity 3D or Gnome Shell, forcing me into Unity 2C or Gnome Classic. So, I'd really like to be able to stop using this hack.\nUpdate 2:\nMidway through Oneiric's run, a kernel update fixed this issue. But this question is still relevant as a general procedure for working around showstopper kernel regressions.\n\nA: This is a kernel bug. There are two workarounds. The first is to boot with acpi=off as described in the question. The second is to boot with a Natty kernel. This is much better, though it seems to make LibreOffice a bit crashy.\n\nA: Did you try hitting Fn+F4? This usually triggers the backlight to turn on\n", "Q: Change brightness Vaio FZ I can't change the brightness on my Vaio VGN-FZ340E.  There isn't even a slider on the screens window.

What worked for me was to find device names by:\nxinput --list\n\nThis returned:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ HOLTEK Wireless USB Device                id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Atmel Atmel maXTouch Digitizer            id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ MICROSOFT SAM                             id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ MICROSOFT SAM                             id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HOLTEK Wireless USB Device                id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Front LifeCam                             id=14   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Rear LifeCam \n\n\"xsetwacom --list\" mentioned by @phnomic wouldn't return anything.\nWe then map devices to screens like @phnomic suggested:\nxsetwacom set \"Atmel Atmel maXTouch Digitizer\" MapToOutput eDP1\nxsetwacom set 11 MapToOutput eDP1\nxsetwacom set 12 MapToOutput eDP1\n\nnote that 11 and 12 are device IDs for the two devices both named \"MICROSOFT SAM\"\n\nA: There is a specific command for mapping input to a display in xsetwacom called MapToOutput. Here is what you do:\nStart by figuring out the name of the display you want to map to. This can be done by running xrandr:\nphnomic@phnomic-jobb:~$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 3200 x 1597, maximum 8192 x 8192\nLVDS1 connected 1280x800+1920+797 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 286mm x 179mm\n   1280x800       60.0*+\n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        59.9  \nVGA1 connected 1920x1200+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      59.9*+\n   1920x1080      60.0  \n   1600x1200      60.0  \n   1680x1050      60.0  \n   1280x1024      60.0  \n   1440x900       59.9  \n   1280x960       60.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3  \n   640x480        60.0  \nHDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nIn my case I want to use LVDS1. \nNext, figure out what your devices are called. This is done using xsetwacom --list:\nphnomic@phnomic-jobb:~$ xsetwacom --list\nWacom ISDv4 E6 Pen stylus           id: 20  type: STYLUS    \nWacom ISDv4 E6 Pen eraser           id: 21  type: ERASER    \nWacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch         id: 22  type: TOUCH     \n\nFinally run the command xsetwacom set \"[device name]\" MapToOutput [screen name] for all devices that you wish to assign. In my case, this becomes:\nphnomic@phnomic-jobb:~$ xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 E6 Pen stylus\" MapToOutput LVDS1\nphnomic@phnomic-jobb:~$ xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 E6 Pen eraser\" MapToOutput LVDS1\nphnomic@phnomic-jobb:~$ xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch\" MapToOutput LVDS1\n\nAnd then you are all good to use your fancy touch screen regardless of what monitors you connect it to and what orientation you use for your monitors.\nIf you want to know more, I recommend this sourceforge post.\n\nA: I wrote a simple script that will fix things using udev.  First create /etc/udev/rules.d/99-monitor-hotplug.rules\nIt is just this line:\nACTION==\"change\", SUBSYSTEM==\"drm\", ENV{HOTPLUG}==\"1\", RUN+=\"/usr/share/X11/touchscreen.sh\"\n\nNow the /usr/share/X11/touchscreen.sh file (mark it +x !!) :\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# This is designed to be run by hotplug.  See hotplug docs ...\n#\n\n# Make sure PATH is sane\nexport PATH=\"/bin:/usr/bin\"\n\n# Now the rest of the ENV to hook into X\n# This should probably be run by Dbus, but I don't know how.\n# Instead I see who's running Dbus, and get that user's .Xauthority\n# So, its kind of a hack!\n\nexport USER=`ps -ef | grep dbus-daemon | grep session | cut -d ' ' -f 1`\nexport DISPLAY=\":0\"\nexport XAUTHORITY=/home/$USER/.Xauthority\nexport ICON=/usr/share/icons/Humanity/devices/48/monitor.svg\n\n# Find Touchscreen id number -- sets id\nexport id=`xinput | grep Touch | cut -d '=' -f 2 | cut -f 1`\n\n# Find the primary screen! \nexport screen=`xrandr | grep primary | cut -d ' ' -f 1`\n\n# Use xinput to map them\nxinput --map-to-output $id $screen\n\nsu $USER -c \"notify-send -i $ICON \\\"TouchScreen\\\"\\\n \\\"Mapping Device $id to your $screen screen\\\"\"\n\nThe last line just pops up a nice message telling you what it did.   When from a terminal, on any user-id, it works great, but won't work from udev!   The script itself works fine - its just the notification that fails from udev.  Yet nother dbus issue I think.   If anyone can fix that - let me know!!\n\nA: Too bad, apparently no-one knows.\nI was lucky, however. A colleague of mine bought the touchscreen laptop a few months ago and didn't mind me playing around with it a bit when he was in the lab. This is what I figured out so far:\nThe touchscreen works flawlessly in Ubuntu 11.10, at least until you connect an external monitor. At that point the touchscreen is aligned to the combined original screen and external monitor, which means you cannot use the touchscreen properly.\nThe good news is that it works just like the Wacom drawing tablets. This means that you can change the monitor area for which the touchscreen operates. By tweaking the Area property of all your devices you can get the touchscreen to work how you want it, for example by executing:\nfor pad in \"Serial Wacom Tablet stylus\" \"Serial Wacom Tablet eraser\" \"Serial Wacom Tablet touch\"\ndo\n    xsetwacom --set \"$pad\" Area 0 0 10000 10000\ndone\n\nwhere the 0 0 10000 10000 values are arbitrary (haven't had the time to figure this out).\nMy hero for today is chh, he figured out and posted how to do this on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1527548. On this link you can also find his scripts to calculate the correct values. The xsetwacom version he used is different from the one I downloaded today, so his scripts didn't do the trick for me. Still, with this link, you should be able to figure it out for yourself.\nLong story short, if you're planning to buy the HP laptop I mentioned earlier, you should be able to get the touchscreen to work properly with an external display attached.\nAnd I should get back to work now.\n\nUpdate! I finally got my laptop this week and did some more in-depth analysis about the dual screen scenario described in this question.\nUsing xsetwacom --list you can get a list of the Wacom-like devices (i.e., your touchscreen). Using the id returned by this command, you can save yourself a lot of typing. In case you want to reproduce what I'm going to explain, it might be useful to know my exact configuration:\ntomas@EliteBook:~$ xsetwacom --list\nSerial Wacom Tablet stylus          id: 16  type: STYLUS    \nSerial Wacom Tablet eraser          id: 18  type: ERASER    \nSerial Wacom Tablet touch           id: 19  type: TOUCH   \n\nUsing id 16 I can get the current area settings (18 and 19 should give the same results here):\ntomas@EliteBook:~$ xsetwacom --get 16 Area\n0 0 26312 16520\n\nWhat this value means I'll leave to the experts. For me, it is important to know that this means 100%. Whether or not the external display is connected, this value remains the same.\nTrial-and-error gave me a decent touchscreen calibration for xsetwacom --set 16 0 0 50000 22000. When you look into it a bit more, you'll see why this makes sense: \nDefine the correct calibration as 0 0 x y and the initial (what I called the 100%) setting as 0 0 x0 y0. \nKnowing my resolution is 1280x800 for the laptop and 1920x1080 for the external monitor and the external monitor is positioned to the right of my laptop, the top part aligned, you'll notice that in the horizontal direction the correct factor is the ratio of my total resolution  (for me, 1280+1920) over my desired touchscreen resolution (1280). This gives a factor I'll define as a = 2.5. In the vertical direction this is 1080 over 800, or b = 1.35.\nYou might want to read the sentence above again. To help you a bit, see this screenshot of arandr.\nTo obtain the perfect value for my horizontal area, x, Simply multiply x0 by factor a. Do the same for your vertical area, y = b*y0, and then repeat for all your touchscreen devices (pen, eraser, touch) and you're all set:\nxsetwacom --set 16 Area 0 0 65780 22302\nxsetwacom --set 18 Area 0 0 65780 22302\nxsetwacom --set 19 Area 0 0 65780 22302\n\nedit: hmm, that's weird, the required area for finger/touch is smaller than the other devices by about a factor 10.\nIf I missed anything or if I'm not clear, send me a message and I'll try to help out.\n", "Q: How to broadcast audio output to iPhone? Is it at all possible to broadcast the usual audio output to an iPhone or similar device? So sort of audio server (Desktop) to client (iPhone).\nmore details: Ubuntu 10.04/11.04 or 11.10, iPhone 3S or 4. It is my understanding that the sound system shipped in Ubuntu can be used as a sound server. The idea would be for the sound system to stream to a remote audio client, for example sitting in a different computer or an iPhone, that computer/iPhone could be connected to a audio amplifier in a different location than the computer where sound/music is played from. The streaming is of course by means of a local (wireless) network. (Although via bluetooth can be a solution also)\n\nA: By running an Icecast server we are able to stream our local sound to any device that is capable of tuning in to an Icecast/Shoutcast internet radio stream. I don't know if an iPhone already comes with this functionality but there likely may be an app to make this possible.\nIf you prefer a graphical frontend rather than a command line solution to start the streaming service you may try out stream2ip.\n", "Q: How to recover from the Dash Home appearing behind other running programs?

Having tried unity, GNOME 3, GNOME-Shell, XFCE, and OpenBox, I would finally like to get back to GNOME 2.x\nNot being a hardcore Linux user, my best bet is to do a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 with GNOME Classic (the real one) which worked very well for me.\nNow how would I prevent the Update Manager to alert me with GNOME updates?

ACTIVE refers to the window that has currently the focus, you can also give the window id which you can obtain via:\nwmctrl -l\n\nPS: The code isn't pretty and the README in there is a bit out of date.\n\nA: If it's just for MPlayer you could use the -noborder argument. \nmplayer -noborder my_video.ogg\n\n\nAs a more general option, if you're using Compiz (default), you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and launch the CompizConfig Settings Manager \n\n*Select the Window Decoration plugin and hit the \"plus\" sign next to \"Decoration Windows\".\n\n*Describe the type of window you do not want title bars on with an \"And\" relationship, and mark \"Invert\". For example:\n\n\n\nClick \"Add\" and enjoy!\n\nA: You can use the -title option:\nmplayer -title ' ' file.avi\n\n\nA: Here's how to remove the title bar, that should work with almost all window managers in X11 :\nxprop -name 'My window name' -format _MOTIF_WM_HINTS 32i -set _MOTIF_WM_HINTS 2\n\nwhere My window name is your window name.\nYou can specify the window id instead, with the -id option.\nIf you omit the -name option, you will have to select the window whose title bar you want removed, by clicking on it.\n", "Q: How to re-compile NM0.9 with enabled wimax? I found that the new Ubuntu comes with the Network Manager 0.9, but without the enabled wimax support. Please, give some advices how to re-compile it with --enable-wimax features. Thank you.\n\nA: I found the solution, quite simple:\nsudo apt-get source network-manager=0.9\nsudo apt-get build-dep network-manager=0.9\n\nAfterwards, we have to extract the archive network-manager_0.9.1.90.orig.tar.bz2 or another one depending on the version.\nCompile with parameters:\n$ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --enable-wimax --with-distro=debian --enable-ppp --enable-polkit --with-udev-dir=/etc/udev --with-dbus-sys-dir=/etc/dbus-1 --with-pppd-plugin-dir=/usr/lib/NetworkManager --with-resolvconf --libexecdir=/usr/lib/NetworkManager --with-systemdsystemunitdir=/etc/systemd --with-dhcpcd=yes\n$ sudo make\n$ sudo make install\n\nOf course, you need to have the wimax service and stack installed, pls, see the linuxwimax.org.\nThat's it.

Recently, ARM single-board systems like the BeagleBoard has been made available on the market. Unlike phones or tablets, these systems can be run as regular PC. But with the varieties of ARM processors around, it's not clear which devices that can run Ubuntu ARM.\nPlease create one answer, per model and make of the device, supported by Ubuntu ARM.\n\nOld Q Are the official ARM images compatible with Raspberry Pi?\nAfter scouring their website, I've gathered that Raspberry Pi is based on Broadcom BCM2835 SoC and ARM11 processor. Does the official ARM images, starting with Oneiric, support those?\n\nA: The little MK802 devices have an ARM-cored Allwinner A10  which runs Ubuntu/Lubuntu absolutely fine.   Google MK802 Lubuntu  to find OS images for it:  google MK802 Mini PC to find the devices (~ $75).    These are more powerful than the Raspberry- approx 1.5GHz CPU and 1GB of RAM.  \n\nA: Looks like the answer is no. Look at this entry in the Raspberry Pi FAQ:\n\nWhat Linux distros will be supported at launch?\n  Debian, Fedora and ArchLinux will be supported from the start. We hope to see support from other distros later. We will be selling SD cards with the distros preloaded. (Sept 4 2011 – originally, this FAQ suggested that Ubuntu would be supported. Because of issues with newer releases of Ubuntu and the ARM processor we are using, Ubuntu can’t commit to support Raspberry Pi at the moment.)\n\nDebian will be supported, though, so it will look familiar :)\n\nA: BeagleBoard\n\nThe BeagleBoard measures approximately 75 by 75 mm and has all the\n  functionality of a basic computer. The OMAP3530 includes an ARM\n  Cortex-A8 CPU, a TMS320C64x+ DSP for accelerated video and audio\n  decoding, and an Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX530 GPU to\n  provide accelerated 2D and 3D rendering that supports OpenGL ES 2.0.\n  Video out is provided through separate S-Video and HDMI connections. A\n  single SD/MMC card slot supporting SDIO, a USB On-The-Go port, an\n  RS-232 serial connection, a JTAG connection, and two stereo 3.5 mm\n  jacks for audio in/out are provided.\nBuilt-in storage and memory are provided through a PoP chip that\n  includes 256 MB of NAND flash memory and 256 MB of RAM (128 MB on\n  earlier models).\nThe board uses up to 2 W of power and can be powered from the USB\n  connector, or a separate 5 V power supply.

Limited support for earlier instruction sets (ARMv5t, ARMv6) was available in early releases of the Ubuntu ARM port (jaunty, karmic).\nRaspberryPI is ARMv6-based. For support on older ARM architectures, I suggest you use Debian.\n\nA: My impression is that most OMAP4 boards should be supported, and at least a few OMAP3-boards. Someone told me the other day that using the PandaBoard was very easy. I haven't tried that myself. \n\nA: I have written a list of ARM based devices which can run Debian or Ubuntu:\nhttp://www.bitkistl.com/p/linux-on-arm-powered-devices.html\nSome of them like the MiQi SBC based on RK3288 ARM SOC offer 2D Desktop acceleration and 3D graphic acceleration, others offer only 3D graphic acceleration or just nothing but slow framebuffer. Only boards based on Nvidia Tegra chips offer full Desktop OpenGL 2D/3D Desktop acceleration, but the support of Nvidia for Linux is a bit limited. \n\n", "Q: Apache 403 Forbidden Error - Can't access webserver Yesterday my apache server decided to don't run anymore and I don't now why.

However there is a way to still achieve this.\nChanging default sink from command line\nFirst we need to determine the index number of the sinks we want to switch. This can be done by calling:\npacmd list-sinks\n\nDepending on our system this will give you a more or less lengthy list of sinks and properties that are at present accessible:\n >>> 2 sink(s) available.\n      * index: 0\n            name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo-extra1>\n            driver: <module-alsa-card.c>\n    :\n    :\n        index: 1\n            name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo>\n            driver: <module-alsa-card.c>\n\nThe index or the name given here is what we need for adressing the sink by command line. The present default sink is marked with an asterix (here 0).\nTo be able to switch the default sinks from command line we may need to disable stream target device restore by editing the corresponing line in /etc/pulse/default.pa to:\nload-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false\n\nTo change the default output sink to sink 1 we then run\npacmd set-default-sink 1\n\nSucess can be visualized by opening the Sound Settings menu.\nMoving a stream to another sink\nChanging the default sink while we have an active input stream playing to a given sink has no effect. This should rather be done by moving this input to another sink.\npacmd list-sink-inputs\n\nwill tell us the index of the input stream\n>>> 1 sink input(s) available.\n    index: 5\n    driver: <protocol-native.c>\n\nWe now know that we want to move the input stream 5 to sink 1 by calling\npacmd move-sink-input 5 1\n\nor back to sink 0 if we like. This will be done immediately without the need of stopping playback.\nChanging default sink while playing\nOf course we can combine those two commands to immediately switch default sinks during playback e.g. with\npacmd set-default-sink 1 & pacmd move-sink-input 5 1\n\nA drawback of this method is that the input stream index changes every time we stop and restart the music player. So we always have to find out the current stream index before we can switch using the commmand line.\n\nA: And here's a script that will toggle between sinks as well:\nhttp://marginalhacks.com/index.0.html#pulse-switch-out\nHere's the script below:\n#!/usr/bin/ruby\n# Filename: pulse-switch-out\n# Author:   David Ljung Madison <DaveSource.com>\n# See License:  http://MarginalHacks.com/License/\n# Description:  Switch pulse audio output (sink) using pacmd\n\nPACMD = %w(pacmd)\n\n##################################################\n# Usage\n##################################################\ndef fatal(*msg)\n    msg.each { |m| $stderr.puts \"[#{$0.sub(/.*\\//,'')}] ERROR: #{m}\" }\n    exit(-1);\nend\n\ndef usage(*msg)\n    msg.each { |m| $stderr.puts \"ERROR: #{m}\" }\n    $stderr.puts <<-USAGE\n\nUsage:  #{$0.sub(/.*\\//,'')} [sink]\n  Switch sound playback device for ALSA/pulseaudio\n\n    [sink]   Specify sink number to use (see 'pacmd list-sinks')\n\n    USAGE\n    exit -1;\nend\n\ndef parseArgs\n    opt = Hash.new\n    loop {\n        if (arg=ARGV.shift)==nil then break\n        elsif arg == '-h' then usage\n        elsif arg == '-?' then usage\n        #elsif arg == '-arg' then opt[:arg] = true\n        elsif arg =~ /^(\\d)$/ then opt[:sink] = arg.to_i\n        else\n            usage(\"Unknown arg [#{arg}]\")\n        end\n    }\n\n    opt\nend\n\n# Unfortunately you can't return or break from the yield without leaving\n# the pipe open, maybe use some sort of ensure and figure out how to close?\ndef pipe(cmd)\n        # This is leaving files open\n    #IO.popen(cmd.join(' ')).each { |l|\n    a = `#{cmd.join(' ')}`\n    ret = $?\n    a.split(\"\\n\").each { |l|\n        yield l\n    }\n    $?\nend\n\ndef getSinks(ins=false)\n    cmd = PACMD.dup\n    cmd.push(ins ?

This works, the only problem is the title bar in my black version stays white unlike the dark color in the screen shots of the theme. This is very distracting as it contrasts to much with the rest of the theme and basically makes it unusable which is a pity as it is a very nice looking theme otherwise.\nAny help / advice will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Have you installed and used Gnome Tweak Tool?\nInstall it by running into the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen run it by pressing the Win/Metakey and typing \"gnome-tweak-tool\". \nSelect the \"Theme\" tab on the left hand side and there should be an option to change the Window Theme via a drop down menu. Select it and then close the program. You may need to log out and log back in to see the effects.\nIf you can't see your Dark Adwaita theme in the drop down, then it may not have been installed properly.\n\nA: I guess this should actually be filed a bug in compiz (if it isn't already).\nThe windowborders are not corresponding to the dark theme-variant, because this functionality is only implemented in Mutter, not in Compiz/Metacity (yet).\n\nA: I had the same problem in 11.10. Here is what I had done to fix this.\nGo the desktop. Right-click -> Select Change Desktop Background -> Change Theme to be used for the UI to Ambiance. ( If it's already selected to Ambiance, then change it to something else, the again select Ambiance ). It worked for me after doing this. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Where did you download Adwaita Dark from? I had some weird issues similar to what you are describing with the download link in a post from OMG! Ubuntu. I had better luck with an updated version of the theme from gnome-look.org\n", "Q: GRUB menu empty When I access GRUB at boot I don't see any entry listed.\nI can see I'm in GRUB because some Debian Grub menu splashdown in the background is displayed. But no entry is listed and nothing happens if I press E.\nIf I press Enter I just boot normally into my Ubuntu installation.\nHow can I get Grub to display the entries? Thanks a lot in advance.\n\nA: I believe from 10.10 onwards you cannot edit boot menu entry from GRUB file in Boot. You can do it following way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and type sudo nano /etc/default/grub.\n\n*After making changes if any, save it with the command Ctrl+O and you'll be asked for the file name to be saved. Just hit Enter which will replace the grub. You can exit the editor by pressing Ctrl+X.\n\n*Update the grub file by running the command sudo update-grub.  \nAs you may know, you must have administrative privileges to use the sudo command.\n\nA: An addition to the answer by Vivek S Panicker: in file /etc/default/grub, there are two lines\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n\nIf they are not commented out, or at least the latter one, that means that the GRUB2 menu will never be shown on boot, unless you press the shift key within the number of seconds defined by GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT. If that value is 0, then you'll never see the GRUB2 menu. Instead, the first item on the menu that would otherwise appear will be booted into.\nSo, you should also check those lines in your /etc/default/grub file, and if they're there, comment them out with the # character, then save the file, command sudo update-grub, and reboot.\n", "Q: How to select and copy content from the terminal (ATL + CTRL + F1) When in the 'lower level terminal' (not sure how this is called), the one opened by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1, how can I copy the content of the command I used there, since there is no mouse and I can not move my cursor out for the command line?\n\nA: You could just redirect the output to a file with > or &>... I was asked to move it from comments to answers, so here it is.  \nBy the way, a couple notes:  \nPutting > in between a command and a filename will overwrite the current contents of the file with standard out.  \nPutting >> appends to a file.\nPutting a & before the redirector will also catch standard error (in Bash > 4).\n\nA: The last used command history is usually stored in your history file (.bash_history). You can open this file with the editor-of-your-choice and copy contents.\nAs for manipulating the command-line of the console window, you can rely on the command line editing functions of the bash shell. They are discussed in the READLINE section of the Bash manual page (man bash). But they will not allow you to paste the copied part into an editor.\nAnother way to work around this is to use the screen utility. There are several introductory tutorials on the web. Screen has a copy and paste function:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press CTRL+A then ESC to get into copy mode.\n\n*By moving around the cursor keys you can position to the first character of your selected region, then press Space. You now have set the first mark.\n\n*Move the cursor to the end of the text you'd like to select and press Space. You have now copied the selected region into the buffer.\n\n*To paste the buffer press CTRL+A and then ].\n\n\nA: To send the output of a command to a file, you can use redirection.\nFor example, you could send your dmesg command to a file with\ndmesg > ~/Documents/output.txt\nThen the output will write to that file instead of the screen. When you come back to the GUI, you can find the file in your Documents folder and access the contents.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install gpm\n\nGPM is just what you need & very useful. While in the console (ctrl+alt+f1), you can copy by dragging the left-hand mouse button, and then paste by clicking the right-hand mouse button. \n\nA: There's several ways to go around this.  The simplest is with xclip and I've saved for the last.\nhbdgaf's answer presents one solution - redirection. Here's two variations on the theme - redirection with named pipe and byobu. First requires no additional software installation, while byobu has to be installed.\nOption 1: named pipe\nWhen you run a command and use pipeline | to redirect its output to another command, that is called an anonymous pipe - it exists for a set moment of time. Named pipe , on the other hand, is a special sort of file, where data goes in, and then goes out. \nHere's the steps to make it work:\n\n\n*\n\n*create the named pipe with mkfifo /tmp/myPipe\n\n*run the command you want and redirect the output to /tmp/myPipe . For instance, sudo apt-get install byobu > /tmp/myPipe. Notice, that the command will wait until you release the output from myPipe. Use & to make it wait in the background, and let you continue using the terminal, like so sudo apt-get install byobu > /tmp/myPipe & . Notice also that stdout will go into the pipe, but stderr will go to the screen. If you want both stderr and stdout in the pipe , use &> instead of >\n\n\n*come back to the GUI, and release the output from that pipe with cat /tmp/myPipe. Now you can copy the output with mouse and keyboard.\n\n\n\nOption 2: shared session in byobu\nAs for byobu, the basic idea is that it creates a shared session. You launch byobu in TTY and GUI terminal, and you see the same output there and there. I'd suggest launching TTY first, because that way it's cleaner. So let's say I launch byobu in TTY2 run df;free , go to GUI, launch gnome-terminal then call byobu, and voila - I see the same output that I saw in TTY !\nOption 3: xclip, the easiest way\nSuppose I wanted to copy output of df command. All I'd have to do with xclip is this:\n$ export DISPLAY=:0 ; df | xclip -sel clip\n\nAnd it will be already in your GUI clipboard !\nThere's a small catch however - xclip is not a native app, and has to be installed via sudo apt-get install xclip\nOf course typing all that in can get repetitive, so you can create a .bashrc function to do the job. Simply copy and paste the function bellow into your .bashrc file, save the file, and now each time you log in , you have a simple command to copy output to clipboard\nfunction toClipboard\n{\n  export DISPLAY=:0\n  \"$@\" | xclip -sel clip\n\n}\n\nAnd you'd run it as $ toClipboard df -h , so notice that you can run command with parameters.\nOption 4: script\nThere exists a command called script which has exactly that purpose - record what you see on command line into a file. You can either run it first, and then type output in it's shell, and then exit; or you can call screen with --command flag, like so script --command \"df -h\"\nHowever, there's a drawback - the output file may contain special characters. Reffer here for info on how to clean the output up\nOption 5: /dev/vcsX\nAs shown by Giles from U&L site, one can actually dump contents of tty onto another terminal's stdout. Suppose we want to dump tty2. The command for that is\n cat /dev/vcs1\n\nDraw back of this method is that if your terminal is set to certain level of scrollback lines, you can get only partial output.\n", "Q: Linking problems after upgrade to 11.10 I have a problem here that I can't quite explain.

I have worked with Ubuntu a bit but is there anything special that can be done with Python code or libraries that can be used that can't in windows?\nI have posted parts of what I have learned and used over time from my Python work in Ubuntu but not sure if I need direction in the sense of best practices etc. If you could review and comment about how I am doing, suggestions for improvement, or experience you could share would be great! My existing code blurbs are at http://www.pythonsnippet.com/snippets\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: It's the computer that decides what can and cannot be done. On the same hardware, anything that's possible in one operating system is possible on the other, unless there are artificial obstacles. In fact, that's what operating systems are there to ensure. As long as you have Python installed on Windows, it can do anything Python can do on GNU+Linux. For almost all applications, you'll use libraries and those libraries can be programmed in other languages, like C, for efficiency. \nThere are two major differences between Windows and Ubuntu: 1) Ubuntu has built-in support for development in many, many languages. Because of this, everything is designed to be accessible using any language. A good example is Unity, in which everything is done over DBus, meaning that you can use any language to control the environment without having special libraries, though that makes it even easier. On Windows, you will have to install all the requirements manually before you can use the application, but then it works just as well. \n2) Ubuntu is free software. This means that nobody has any incentive to say that a library should only be used on Ubuntu. Quite the contrary. The more developers using a library, the more valuable that library becomes. Windows is very different. Not only is it a proprietary operating system, owned by a single entity, but the development tools are also proprietary and sold by that entity. That means they have billions of incentives to make sure the developers write applications using libraries that cannot, or cannot easily, be used on other operating systems. Microsoft has shown som willingness to change, but they still have long ways to go before they can rest on their laurels. \nIn summary, if you develop on Ubuntu, your application will work on any desktop. You'll have to provide an installer if it should be used on Windows, but there are programs to automate that tasks. If your apps rely on direct system interaction, then you might need to adjust your code slightly, but it's no big deal. This will improve with time. For instance, we've already seen indicator services for Windows, which makes your AppIndicator written for Ubuntu, automatically appear as a Windows systray icon with no effort from the developer. We should have a generic solution for this. If your app depends on DBus for inter-process communication, then that will just work as well, since DBus has already been ported to Windows. We'll want a DesktopCouch service, etc. These are not technically difficult things to do, they just needs to be done, and they will be. \nI would actually say that even if, as a developer, your main target is Windows, you should still develop that software on Ubuntu. Not only is it a very comfortable environment with all the tools you need, and a strong community to back you up, but it also ensures that you, as a developer, always have the freedom to expand your audience at any time, with minimal effort. I particularly, and very strongly, recommend using Python with GTK3. \nWow, I'm long winded. :)\n\nA: I haven't seen anything done on the windows side that can't be done on the linux side as far as python is concerned.  There may be some issue with compiled code components and the native C API.  Other than that, in my experience, it's pretty much the same.\n", "Q: Recover Ubuntu OS after windows update/upgrade? MY system had Win 7 Home Basic, after which I created separate partitions for a Linux Ubuntu installation. After doing this I had the option to choose between each OS at startup due to the dual boot.\nRecently I've updated Win 7 Home Basic to Professional Edition.

I am not prompted to login to Ubuntu during startup - I am being directly logged into Windows without being prompted. \nWhy is this so?

Since Linux is worthless without the Internet, I can't even evaluate it until 8111e suport is included.\n\nA: Linux is worthless without internet? At least Ubuntu comes with lots of useful applications by default, unlike some other operating systems you may have heard of. As with Windows, for example, drivers can be provided on a CD that comes with the product. You would then double-click the .deb-file, be provided with a graphical wizard and install the driver, just like in any other operating system. Or you can download the driver yourself and copy it the old fashioned way, just like you would do in Windows if you had lost the driver CD. In other words, this has nothing to do with Linux or Windows, but is about poor customer service. \nDrivers are the hardware manufacturers job, though Linux does provide drivers even for some of the least customer friendly manufacturers. If your hardware manufacturer refuses to provide you with a driver CD, and will not let drivers be built into the operating system, then that's bad customer service and should be remembered the next time you purchase hardware. \n", "Q: How do I disable the app menu at the user level?

I am stuck with a rather irritating problem I ran into after installing 11.10 on my macbook pro 5,5.\nI did a clean install efi booting into the setup using the desktop cd. Upon the first reboot I was presented with the \"invalid arch independent ELF magic\" and grubs rescue console.\nI have read GRUB: \"invalid arch independent ELF magic\" after install on SSD but the solution is no solution for me since installing grub via live cd only means installing the mbr version and I can't seem to find any manual on how to install grub-efi while booted into the live cd.\nSo my question is: How can I either edit the grubx64.efi file in my EFI Partition, reinstall grub-efi with a live CD / DVD or use grub rescue commands to fix this issue?\n\nA: I had the same problem “invalid arch independent ELF magic”.\nI was installing from a USB stick booted from the Bios in UEFI mode.\nAfter a couple a couple unsuccessful reinstallation of 12.04,I tried the same installation with the the USB stick booted without the UEFI mode and it works.\nFor your information my setting on a 120GB SSD\nsda1 /windows 90 GB   windows 7\nsda2 /boot  100 MB\nsda5 swap     1 GB\nsda6 /        18GB   ubuntu 12.04\nsda7 /home     8GB\n\nMy motherboard is P8P67 Pro with Asus EZbios and I had two choice in my boot menu for the USB with 12.04 installation.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: The solution for me was (and probably for anyone having that problem):\nBoot into the live cd and type into the terminal (of course you must edit the mounting operations respecting your own partition table):\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi-amd64\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot \nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nNow grubx64.efi should boot without any problems.\nRunning update-grub while booted into ubuntu restored the more eye friendly looks of the grub boot menu.\n\nA: I used the boot repair option in System Tools (I think) that was there after booting live CD/USB.

Not just normal 1MB or less updates but some like 20MB, 40MB, 50MB.\nJust to add I always activate all the repositories (Universe, Multiverse...) and only add the WineHQ PPA. I have used Ubuntu since 5.04 and started studying how frequently updates come since 9.10. Typically, updates came almost once a week and they were between 100KB to 25MB. Sometimes to get to 30MB it would have to passed 2 weeks at least.\nI have to say Ubuntu 11.10 in less than a month has received more than 200 updates which is a lot in comparison to 11.04, 10.10 or 10.04. At least in my case all bugs I tried to report were either solved the next day or before the end of the week (Sharing Network, Launcher bugs, video bugs, calendar bugs...).\nSo I wonder why is 11.10 being worked on so much faster (and efficient) and why. Does it involve using it as base for 12.04, will this type of development continue with future versions, will something big in the future come to surprise the Ubuntu community?\n\nA: This is a very subjective question and there is no correct answer as such.\nToday I got a huge update as opposed to many small updates which used to arrive. Our rate and update size will differ based on the applications installed. I have noticed that they have fixed more bugs this cycle. Previous cycle was more about Get Unity up and running and make it stable enough to be minimally usable. This cycle was about Get Unity usable and fix big, small bugs. Probably the workload on Desktop team was less, so enough attention was given to other packages too. This might explain the more bug fixing. My statement that more bugs were fixed is just a personal experience.\nAs you asked whether is will be a base for 12.04? Ubuntu does not take the previous release and start working on it. Every time after the release when development is open, there is a package sync period from Debian. Usually sync happens from Debian unstable for regular releases. Since 12.04 is an LTS, it will be based on Debian testing rather than Debian unstable\nIt is true that they carry forward the patchset and all the improvements from previous cycle, but those are a very small percentage of the whole archive changes. Debian moves ahead in 6 months and updating old packages is an enormous task, so they just sync from debian every time.\n", "Q: Hardware MAC address change using live CD? I would like to save a new MAC to the hardware, so I can use the new MAC address on Windows. I am using live CD of the newest Ubuntu. If I try ifconfig it doesn't save it for my Windows system. I don't have admin permissions on Windows. \nI need to change MAC address so the Windows one changes too.\n\nA: What network card? Some NICs store the MAC in EEPROM that can be reprogrammed by software.  If your card is setup like this, and the Linux driver exposes an interface to the EEPROM, ethtool (available in Ubuntu repos) can read/write to it.\nThis article looks like a good overview of the process of rewriting the MAC.  Don't blindly use the examples from there though, since they may not be suited for your card.\n\nA: Run nm-connection-editor then click on the 'Edit...' button.\n\nA: The MAC address is coded to the firmware of the NIC (Network Interface Card). In order to change the MAC on the card itself you would need to change the data in the firmware. The 'nm-connection-editor' doesn't do this. I don't believe there is an application under Ubuntu that does this. Even 'macchanger' is a temporary change that is reflected by the OS, not the card. \nAlso, you may want to check on the legal status of what you are trying to do. Agree or not, I'm fairly sure it's a questionable practice. Especially on a machine that you don't have administrative rights on.\nUpdate: You can see more about MAC address spoofing and it's implications here. This is a Canadian website. The legal implications vary based on your location/jurisdiction. \n", "Q: Why did my fullscreen graphical performance decrease with Unity 3D?

The screen resolution of the initial login screen was off, and once I had logged in it had a very, very small resolution, and the display was all distorted. Much of the menubar was broken and everything in general looked distorted also. It after a few minutes went into a screen that checked my battery and other things, and then turned off.\nNow when I turn on the computer I more often than not get a failed login screen that cannot display many of the components of the login screen.\nI am a newbie to using ubuntu so sorry if this is a stupid question.\nThanks for your help in advance :D\nEDIT:\nThese pictures show some of the login screen errors:\n(Under GDE login option)\n\n\n\nA: OK. Just to make sure I'm understanding correctly. You are able to login, but the resolutions are wrong.\nIf that is the case, let's start with the simple things first. In the upper right hand corner you should see a \"gear\" icon. Click on it, then select 'System Settings' > Display.\nFrom here select 'Detect Monitor'. After that, attempt to adjust your monitor settings.\n(Caveat, I know this seems really simple, but some solutions are.)\nIf that didn't work. Return to the 'System Settings' window and select 'Hardware'.\nFrom here, see what Video drivers are being offered. One of them is probably selected, and has a green bubble beside it. Select another driver, if available. Your best recourse may be to deselect the currently selected driver to see if it will use the Nuveau driver(or other default driver) instead. The Nuveau driver is non proprietary, and works well on most nVidia cards I've dealt with, but it doesn't support 3D rendering on serveral nVidia cards. I'm not as familiar with ATI cards, but a similar process should yield similar results.\nHope this is helpful. Please respond if helps/doesn't help or if I'm not understanding the situation properly.\n\nA: If you have an nvidia video card.\nYou can remove the new driver and revert to the nuveau driver by opening a terminal and entering\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-173\n\nI'm not certain but I beleive you can do a similar thing with ATI drivers as well if needed.\n\nThis link looks similar to what you're asking.

I'm trying to make a custom launcher in 11.10 for the special force quit launcher we had in 11.04 (you could add it from the list of apps, but now it is nowhere to be found, even in alacarte). So I try using info from here\nbut I have no idea what the actual file or command is for force quit nor where it is in the file system.\nThis question is real specific to force quit itself and is not about asking how to create a launcher.\nI will create a file called forcequit.desktop and put it in ~/.local/share/applications folder and will then drag it unto the toolbar like it is told elsewhere.\nThe content of the file will look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open  \n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=sh -c 'notify-send \"Click on an application to force-close it, or press Esc to cancel.\"; xkill'\nName=Force Quit\nComment=Click on the app to quit with your pointer\nIcon=gnome-panel-force-quit\nCategories=System,Accessories;\n\nI suppose it might be a special command that takes an argument, again if you have the info please do tell :)\nI wrote comments in the file about the info I need.\nEdit: ok now it works with showing a special X icon and does force quit properly.\nNow I just need to find out how to get instructions to appear for an end user, just like it does when using from CLI. I'd suppose it displays the launcher's comment on screen somewhere? Any ideas or links ? Or maybe I need to add something to this launcher file ?\nLast edit: well the solution from the above edit has been found, it is the usage of notify send that does the trick. Like it is now reflected in the code.\nEnjoy the solution for your desktop (or for end users you support !)\nLatest edit: all this talk makes me want to go look for notify-send options a little more... and well in a greater scale at all the other commands I can use.....notify-send is part of gnome, is it ? Or is it part of sh? (I doubt it's from sh)\nEdit to the lastest edit :\nnever mind that. I found an answer to that as well. notify-send is part of the libnotify library package... and notify-send is in the tools folder (I had trouble finding it at first…) and no it isn't specifically part of gnome, but rather another library used by many apps :)\n\nA: Instead of writing your own you can try this:\n\nGo here and check it out; http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/10/freezeunfreeze-unity-app-killer/\nor http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/10/force-quit-applet-unity-launcher/\n\nA: I don't know if there is an icon for force quit, but the relevant command is xkill.\n\nA: If you absolutely need the notification, then you can achieve this with notify-send.\nCreate the following file, perhaps as forceclose:\n#!/bin/sh \nnotify-send 'Force close application' 'Select a window to close it.  All data in that window will be lost.  Right click to cancel.' --icon=gtk-cancel\nxkill\n\nThen mark it as a script with chmod +x forceclose\nThen either :\n\n*\n\n*Move it to your /bin directory with sudo mv forceclose /bin/forceclose and change your launcher to call forceclose instead of xkill. (useful for multiple users of the same system, perhaps).\nOr\n\n\n*Change your launcher to point to whichever directory contains your forceclose script.  Note that other users of that system obviously won't be able to use your script.\n\nA: The command, as WarriorIng64 already said, is xkill.\nTo show some instructions for the end user, maybe use \nnotify-send \"Click on an application to force-close it, or right-click to cancel.\"\n\nNow to combine two commands into one launcher, you'll have to wrap them in sh -c '...', so your .desktop file should say\nExec=sh -c 'notify-send \"Click on an application to force-close it, or right-click to cancel.\"; xkill'\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Press Alt+F2.\n\n*Type xkill. then press Enter.\n\n*Click on the window you want to kill (right click to abort).\n\n", "Q: Why are letters overlapping in the terminal?

A while back I installed (a permanent installation, not a Live USB) Ubuntu on my USB thumb drive. Unfortunately, the transfer rates are too slow for a smooth and responsive experience, so I'd like to load more of the OS into RAM when it boots up, kind of like a Live USB. \nThe problem is that while a typical Live USB created from the standard desktop .iso will probably fit in 2 GB of RAM when the OS (/casper/filesystem.squashfs?) is fully uncompressed and loaded, my installation is nearly 5 GB in size, and my computer only has 2GB of RAM. However, much of the installation consists of texlive packages and other files which I definitely use, but use rarely. In reality, the commonly used apps and files are so little that their total size could probably fit in RAM easily.\nIs it possible to modify my already existing (permanent) Ubuntu installation on a USB thumb drive such that I can specify which folders should load to RAM (and which ones can be excluded), as I don't believe I can fit the whole OS into 2GB of RAM. I mainly want my browser, shell, and common shell commands to be fast. /home is not very important when it comes to performance.\nI've partitioned the USB drive as follows, if it helps:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot (/boot)\n\n*root (/)\n\n*home partition (/home)\n\n*swap\n\n\nAlso, I've taken a look at a Boot to RAM page on the Ubuntu website, but the focus there seems to be for customizing a LiveCD image. \n\nA: Check out these instructions. To summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*align the partitions with the SD card erase block size (so the filesystems are aligned when created).  \n\n*Move directories like /tmp and /var/log to RAM by making fstab entries. Also turn off access time tracking for / with the noatime option in fstab.  \n\n*Link other directories like /var/cache/apt/archive and your browser cache to a place in /tmp.  \n\n*Make RAM home based users for quickest access -- you may not explicitly write much in your home directory, but the GUI and browser certainly do.\n\n\nA: While not a direct solution to your question, it may still help: there are a number of linux distributions which run entirely from RAM.\n", "Q: Controlling Phonon via command line?

Next to shell theme, you should see a button the says \"None\" with a folder icon. If you see a triangle with an exclamation point, it means that you have not installed the gnome-shell theme selector extension, which can be installed using the following commands in a terminal window:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions-common\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme\n\nOnce the extension is installed, select the the .zip file for the theme that you want to install (Do NOT unpack it) by clicking on the \"None\" button in the Theme tab of gnome-tweak-tool.

In fact, VirtualBox cannot generally expose all the capabilities of your physical graphics card to guests - guests will always see a virtualbox graphics driver.\nTo get apps like Photoshop working well in guests, you need to install the Guest Additions software in the guest, and you need to enable 3D acceleration and allocate (usually) 64MB or 128MB of video memory in the guest settings. \n", "Q: Compiz and drag behavior after \"snapping\" Big question..\nDoes anybody has problems while dragging a snapped window from the corners (aero-snap-style?)\nI have this very very annoying problem ..and also some comparable problems with dragging in the EXPO view.. at the second click to a window to drag it moves exponentially to the mouse.\n\nA: There is a workaround for this.

I have a tablet PC that I'm running oneric on. One thing I don't like is that the default lock screen requires you to enter a password.

Go to the Language Support menu in the System Settings menu and add the languages you want to support. After that restart LibreOffice and you will see that the spellchecker for example will give you  the option of using the newly installed languages.\n\nA: You need to apply changes system wide in-order to reflect it in LibreOffice, Go to System Settings, Select your language preferences to get the language pack not just for LibreOffice but for your system.  \n\nA: Ensure that the document language is correct, e.g. \"English (USA)\" and not {en}\nOn LibreOffice Write 7.1.4, I received a .docx document for which spellcheck wasn't working, even though everything worked fine when I created a new document from scratch.\nThe solution was to go:\n\n*\n\n*Tools\n\n*Language\n\n*For All Text\n\n*English (USA)\n\nBefore doing this, I could see that the selected language was a bogus {en} under \"For All Text\". After I selected \"English (USA)\", {en} disappeared as  a choice completely, and spellchecking started working.\nSo this indicates that {en} was some bogus value that was not properly imported by LibreOffice. This is likely a bug, I'll report it if I ever manage to produce a minimal .docx example from word that I can share.\n", "Q: .passw hidden files in /etc Rkhunter reported me that it found hidden files in /etc:\nWarning: Hidden file found: /etc/.group.48239632746: ASCII text\nWarning: Hidden file found: /etc/.passwd.13046384800: ASCII text\nWarning: Hidden file found: /etc/.passwd.14350544901: ASCII text\nWarning: Hidden file found: /etc/.passwd.16941124733: ASCII text\nWarning: Hidden file found: /etc/.passwd.22154181091: ASCII text\nWarning: Hidden file found: /etc/.passwd.48239632746: ASCII text\n\nShould I be worried about it? \nIt seems those files are copies of the original passwd file....\nRegards\n\nA: Question answered by OP in comments\n\nIt seems to be the GUI I use.

If you log in to Ubuntu One and sync your\n  files, then log into Ubuntu One as a different user on your ocmputer and\n  perform a sync without clearing out the old metadata you will get errors.\n  To fix this please open a Terminal and run the following commands:\nu1sdtool -q\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/ubuntuone\nu1sdtool -c\nLet Ubuntu One run for a bit as it recreates your metadata.\nThanks,\n  Duane\n\n\nA: Nope, I don't think so. There is no \"administrator\" account on Linux, so to say. Only root, but you should never run X11 (the graphical environment) as root. So ... in short: NOPE. It's a simple application, which keeps your stuff synced. It's like Wuala, or Dropbox.

I'm fairly new to Ubuntu and while messing around with different things and trying out some shells, I've managed to mess my system up.

I had tons of updates installed, downloaded and setup my machine for Android development, and a few other things with a very slow internet connection.\n\nA: Open a terminal and try this command:\nrm -r ~/.config/ ~/.cache/\n\nand relogin. In a perfect world, this would restore a stock environment without any data loss. The world is good enough that it may work for you. However, not all software is standards compliant, so... if your login is still borked, backup everything and run:\nrm -rf ~/.[^.]*\n\nThis will delete configuration for all applications. It will also delete some user information, such as your browser login information, your email credentials, save game files, etc. \n", "Q: What is a realistic date for the kernel power regressions fixes? Linux kernel has cumulated multiple power management regression bugs which make systems affected barely usable. A system that works at 30/30 temperatures on Windows during office work may work on Linux at 70/65 while staring at the desktop without any programs being actively used. The power usage / batery drain of course go along with the temperatures. There are no fixes to the problems yet. Just partial temporary \"solutions\"\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1865820\nCan someone share his knowledge / prediction / estimate on a realistic release date for the fixes? (please say which of these you're posting) This will help me to make a decision on further steps until the real fixes to the kernel arrive:\n\n\n*\n\n*trash Linux and install Windows \n\n*do a kernel downgrade Do kernel    downgrades to fix power\nregressions in newer kernels?\nEdit:\nThe timeline of the past linux kernel releases\nSo judging upon the history of the kernel releases it's safe to say that waiting is not a good choice.\n\nA: There is no actual date or any realistic release. Not even in the staging area for the 3.2 version of the Kernel. you can only wait until the diverse groups that are working on this start showing some progress (if any) on this problem which is one of 3 huge ones I see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Faster Power Consumption\n\n*Multiple Problems Related to Intel's New Architecture (Sandy & Ivy Bridges)\n\n*Increased Temperature \n\n\nThere are other but this 3 are the ones that affect more users.\nI know it has been a long time since this problems appeared (Since the 2.6.38. 2.6.37 was fine), not only for battery drain and temperature but Sandy & Ivy also. The only thing is to wait and know that, since this is an open sourced work, there are thousands of eyeballs looking at the code and trying to help in any way they can to solve the problem.\nFor what I have read in several places, trying to solve one problem creates others for other users and this is something most developers do not want. They want to solve the actual problem without creating new ones and since Linus Torvald is VERY EXPLICIT in this particular way of working, any added merges to the kernel that fix one of this, or any other for that matter BUT create other problems will not be added to the master kernel. I find this to be a better way of working towards a regression free kernel than as it did not too long ago were an added patch created more problems than it solved.\nI will not say that at the end of the 3.2 version or in the 3.3 version, 3.4,...4.0 version this problem will be solved but our only thing right now is to wait or be part of the developers of the kernel and work on that problem.\nThere are many studies at phoronix about this issue (and other specific stuff like Intel) like:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_mobile_uffda&num=1\n\n*http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_31_power_regress&num=1\nSo to answer your questions that is in all of us the short answer is: There is no sure date to when this problem will be fixed but it WILL be fixed.\nUPDATE\nAs mentioned by our very own famous user29347 (who we will now call the mistery man) there are 2 Phoronix links that show progress in regards to the Power regressions and other related news but one in particular where is mentioned that there was a Pull a couple of days ago that finally solved this problem in the 3.3 Kernel. This link is: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTA0MTM\nSo the 3 points mentioned above about power consumption, multiple architecture problems for ivy and sandy bridges, video problems and temperature problems will be solved in the 3.2 and 3.3 kernel versions. Most probably any left over misc bug will be addressed in the 3.4 kernel and finally finish anything left over.\n", "Q: How to install xorg-x11-fonts I need to install xorg-x11-fonts. I was searching in Google how to install them but couldn't really find anything. I need it for Ubuntu 11.04.\n\nA: There is no xorg-x11-fonts package in Ubuntu.  There is a package by that name in Fedora, but rather than packaging up a bunch of fonts into a single package they are split up on Ubuntu in packages such as xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi, xfonts-75dpi, xfonts-cyrillic, etc.\nSome of these font packages are probably already installed on your system, but for the most part scalable outline fonts are preferred to these legacy bitmap fonts.\nIf there is a particular bitmap font you need to install, you can probably find it by searching for packages containing xfonts in their name.\n", "Q: How to write an init script that will execute an existing start script?

And most init scripts seems so complex I'm getting sort of lost.\nAll I really want to do is:\n#!/bin/bash\n/opt/myapp/bin/my_start_script\n\nIf that just happened at startup I'd be very happy.\n\nA: Use Upstart as the System V Init scripts are being deprecated and its simpler. \nSimply place this file my_script.conf into /etc/init\n# Start when pc starts up\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n# Stop when pc shuts down \nstop on runlevel [016]\n\n# Start Script \nexec my_start_script\n# Stop Script \npre-stop my_stop_script\n\nThe pre-stop will script contain code to kill your 3 process and is optional, when the service is stopped sigterm will be sent to the my_start_script process but depending on your script it may already have exited. \nYou can test your new service by running sudo service my_script start and sudo service my_script stop\n\nA: You can add your link to the Startup Applications application in Ubuntu if you want to use the GUI.  The downside of this is that it will only execute when you log in to the GUI (i.e. not for other users, and not if you don't log in to the Ubuntu Desktop environment).\nUsing the command line, you can cause a script to run before the Ubuntu Desktop loads.\nTo do this, make your script executable, copy it to /etc/init.d and create a symbolic link to the script in /etc/rc2.d if you want it executed in the default multi-user runlevel (runlevel 2).  You should rename it with an S followed by the order you want it executed in, respective to the other links in there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make script executable:\nsudo chmod u+x myscript.sh\n\n*Copy it to /etc/init.d:\nsudo cp myscript /etc/init.d\n\n*Create a symlink in rc2.d:\ncd /etc/rc2.d\nsudo ln -s /etc/init.d/myscript.sh\n\n*Rename it according to the naming scheme:\nsudo mv myscript.sh S70myscript.sh\nFor more information, see the README files in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc2.d.\n", "Q: How to turn off digital output on my iMac?

If you're not afraid of command line, you can use that straight away.\nThere are also numerous wrappers around rsync, such as Conduit, GRSync, gtkrsync, unison, luckybackup, mrb and possibly others. They all available in Ubuntu repositories so you can just install them via Software Center and see which one you like most.\nThose applications are not specific for Ubuntu 11.10 and have been available for quite a while.\n\nA: it is possible \ntry apps such as conduit or unison\nor check here \nHow to sync files/data between two PCs on a home network?\n", "Q: How do I install my graphics driver for Dell Latitude D620? I have a Dell Latitude D620 with 11.10 on it, and I am wondering how to install Intel or Intel-Compatible drivers for my integrated video card.\n\nA: you dont need to install the drivers are present in your kernel\n\nA: Unlike Windows, Ubuntu supports most hardware out of the box.\nYou do not really need to install extra drivers.\nIf Unity and other features works as expected, you have the correct hardware configuration.\nIf your graphics card shows up as \"Unknown\" (what usually happens with on-board Intel cards, also happened with my GM45), open terminal, and enter the following command:\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\n\nOr install it from here via the Software Center:\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/mesa-utils/\n", "Q: Where is the accessories folder located? I installed NotifyOSD Config but I can't find the accessories folder in Ubuntu 11.10 where notifyosd should be located.\nDoes anyone know where it is or how to open it?\n\nA: The design of Unity trades ease of accessing any arbitrary application for ease of accessing a small number of \"preferred applications\". This means that browsing to anything but the most commonly used applications now requires a little more work.\nTo get a list of Accessories, you now must click Ubuntu button ▸ More Apps ▸ Filter results ▸ Accessories ▸ Installed: See more results.\n\nIn the case that you know what you're looking for ahead of time, though, it is immensely faster to use Unity's search function. Press Super to open the dash, then just start typing what you want.

When I press Alt Tab and change focus to a different application and then come back to Nautilus to check the status of the task I sometimes can not access the file copy status window. \nThere seems to be no handle on the file copy/move/delete status window so I have to guess using disk space and disk activity when the copy is complete. How can I make this status window persistent. \n\nA: You need to manually minimize all your active windows.  Its actually in the background.\nThe file copy progress has a problem of not showing in the task list when you alt-tab and not showing in the application bar either.\nAlso this would point out that if you minimize your file operation status window, then you will never see it again, up till all the file operations are complete.\nOr\nCtrl+Alt+Tab and select the \"File Operation\" that you will get the copy-past progress window.\n\nA: try right-clicking the \"file operations\" window, and click \"always on top\"\ndo that before you are moving to another program with alt+tab or clicking any application bar.\nit is still invisible in alt+tab operations or \"activities\" tab (for gnome-shell users), but once you choose any program to work with, the \"file operation\" window is still there.\nit's a bit annoying, especially for large file operations.\n...and yes, i think you should do the trick everytime you are copying/moving files. haven't tried it myself though.\n\nA: The same just happened to me on Ubuntu 11.10 & Gnome3. And no, the progress window is neither available through Activities nor by minimizing. I filed a bug report.\n\nA: @afronoia:\nyou can use devilspie (or more easily the gui gdevilspie) to automatically make the window always on top.\nHere is how I have if configured (in german):\n( if \n( begin \n( is ( application_name ) \"nautilus\" )\n( is ( window_name ) \"Dateioperationen\" )\n) \n( begin \n( above )\n( println \"match\" )\n)\n)\n\nHowever you have to adjust the ( is ( window_name ) \"Dateioperationen\" ) line to fit your language.\n", "Q: image viewer: mouse wheel to move back and forward In the gnome image viewer (3.2.0), I would like to change these shortcuts for next/prev image to use the mousewheel.  I would also like to change it in shotwell if possible.  Current the mousewheel is assigned to zoom in/out on the current image, which I almost never need.  \nI've tried setting on desktop/gnome/interface/can_change_accels in gconf-editor but no luck.  \nI have found where I think I should edit, in ~/.config/eog/accels, there are lines like \n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/MenuActionsGallery/GoPrevious\" \"<Alt>Left\")\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/MenuActionsGallery/GoNext\" \"<Alt>Right\")\n\nWhich I guess I should uncomment (remove semicolon) and assign to something else, but what could be the accel for mouse wheel events?\n\n\nA: I dumped eog, instead using gthumb .  The mousewheel has, by default, the sensible behaviour I was trying to get eog/shotwell to use, and as an added bonus it is seemingly much faster at rendering images too.  \n\nA: There is a plugin available to do this:\neog plugin Bad Mouse Wheel\nIts called bad, because the eog-developers love another mouse behaviour....\n\nA: Sadly, this isn't possible without modifying the Eye of GNOME source code.\naccels is an abbreviation of \"keyboard accelerators,\" and there is no way to associate these with mouse button events.\n", "Q: Print Screen key doesn't work if a drop-down menu is active On 11.10, I don't get a screengrab when pressing the Print Screen button on my keyboard if I have activated a drop down menu.  For example, in nautilus, I can click the File menu and press the print screen button, nothing happens.  Deactivating the drop down menu and all other things being equal, it works.  Is that normal?  Often when using this thing I'm actually needing to show some of those menu options.\nCurrently I use the workaround to grab after a delay of a few seconds, but I'm used to the print screen button working no matter what's in focus and would prefer it that way.  \n\nA: and what about shutter it will work without a problem, but you need to rebind the print key to shutter\nRebinding the print key:\n- open compiz\n- go to gnome compatibility\n\n- switch to commands tap and in the Screenshot command line Write shutter -f -d 3\nthis will take a screen-shot after 3 seconds and you can take a screen-shot for you menus or simple ignore the 3 seconds delay and it will also work by this command shutter -f\n\n Now you can take a screen-shot to any menu you want, for more options see this.\n", "Q: How to install NotifyOSD-Config?

After killing X and doing a manual startx, X loads rather well, I can see notifications from notifysend (such as guake and dropbox) and can run some X programs (my autostarted synergy works well).\nI should mention that my upgrade did not go smoothly and did something like give an error that the upgrade did not complete successfully, followed by a message that my upgrade did complete successfully.\n\nA: The /run directory is a tmpfs mount.  This means that the contents of the directory do not persist over reboots.  If files are missing from that directory, it means that the programs that write to the directory are not running (or have not been run).  It isn't a case of those programs failing to run due to files not being found in that directory.\nYou mention that you attempted an upgrade and it did not complete successfully.  Your best bet would be to try and complete that upgrade.  Running the following from the command line will likely get your system into a better state:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: I've \"fixed\" this by re-installing while leaving the home directory untouched.\n", "Q: Gnome 3 and compiz, everything works except Explode and Leaf Spread animations I am using 11.10 with Gnome 3, I have installed Compiz, and have got it functioning almost how I want it.

Running pwd at this point returns (unreachable)/, however echo $HOME returns /home/jon as expected.  If I cd then I get taken to my actual home folder.\nWhat could be the reasons for this?  It doesn't seem to cause any problems, apart from public key authentication with SSH (presumably if it can't see the home folder then it can't get to the .ssh folder inside it).  It seems to be consistent until restart - that is, every new shell will do this, until I restart, when it will either work normally or not.\nThis has been happening for at least the last few release upgrades, so not related to Oneiric.  I selected the installer option to encrypt my home folder.\n\nA: The question and answer for Is it possible to use the 'screen' command to work with files on an encrypted home directory? helped me understand why this might be happening: being logged in via screen with ssh doesn't tell Ubuntu that you're still using the system and so after a while (overnight in my case) the encrypted home directory gets unmounted, so Vim can't save files it had open in screens, and the working directory on the command prompt becomes (unreachable). \nI know that the problem goes away if I have an NX session logged in. NX might be described as screen for GUI; I just start an NX session and disconnect it (letting it run the background), and can continue using ssh/screen indefinitely. Not elegant or ideal but I use NX occasionally so it worked for me.\nThe linked question also suggests deleting the empty file in /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.ecryptfs/auto-umount. This might help if you don't use NX.\n\nA: I have had the same problem having (unreachable) folder found in my remote Ubuntu machine with personal encrypted home folder.\nThe problem involve also any program that is running on the background (in my case were several MATLAB instances which required to save workspaces).\nI permanently solved the problem by deleting\n/home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.ecryptfs/auto-umount\n\nas suggested by Ahmed Fasih and reported in Is it possible to use the 'screen' command to work with files on an encrypted home directory?.\nI suggest to set this problem as solved and be a reference for other users since there are not any other answers/topics on this matter (and required me a lot of searching to understand this issue).\n\nA: \n\"I selected the installer option to encrypt my home folder.\"\n\nI'd say that may be your answer, I may have this slightly incorrect as I don't use ecryptFS on any machines that I'm not using logged in a normal environment.  But I think it may have something to do with your home directory being encrypted, thus its contents aren't available, unless you're either logged in physically on the machine's console, or you've specifically mounted/decrypted the home directory contents.\nIf you go to /home/jon is all your content there, or a README.txt and small .desktop link to help you start the decryption/mounting process?\n", "Q: Customizing GNOME Shell animations How do I change/edit the animations in GNOME Shell?

After changing it I started getting a problem where the screen just went black when loading the lightdm login screen (Where I punt my user and password). The thing is, if I disconnect the VGA cable and connect it again I get to see the lightdm greeter and everything works perfect.\nThe problem is that I have to connect/disconnect every time I reboot the PC.\nI tried installing the 285.xx drivers. Same problem. I removed the Nvidia drivers installed with Jockey, rebooted, same problem. I install the current 280.xx again, same problem.\nAfter all that I installed a fresh install of Ubuntu, selected to install the Nvidia drivers while installing it from the livecd. After booting the same problem appeared.\nDmesg does not say anything wrong about it. Same goes for the log from Jockey.\nWhat else should I check or what to do to solve it.\nJust to clarify, this does not happen BEFORE the lightdm greeter appears. Am guessing before the actual use of the video card with X starts with all the 2D/3D stuff that is used in ligthdm and unity. I can use any tty and even see the Ubuntu logo when starting.\nUPDATE: When I open a game in fullscreen the problem appears again. I have to unplug the monitor cable and plug it back in to see the game. Then when I quit the game I have to do it again to see the desktop.\nUPDATE 2: Today I bought a HDMI cable, connected the video card to the TV am testing it with and it actually did log in correctly without any black screen but it shows the resolution a little over the actual size of the screen. So I see only half of the launcher since the left side of it is hidden outside of the real resolution and the top bar is beyond the resolution. So the black screen is related to the VGA connection.\nUPDATE 3 - After installing 12.04 and updating or installing 12.10, black screen problems are gone.\n\nA: This has since been solved by installing and updating the Nvidia driver to 290.xx or greater.\nTo do this follow this steps:\nThe launchpad https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates has the latest Nvidia Drivers (And Ati, And Intel, And...)\nIn a terminal execute: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nUpdate your repositories either by clicking on the \"Check\" button in the Update Manager or running in a terminal sudo apt-get update\nThe Nvidia driver version 290.xx should appear available. Install it, reboot, done.\nThis solved the black screen problem using a VGA cable with a TV (Might also solve other problems mentioned in the changelog)\nNOTE - This did not solve the problem that some users are having that the resolution is outside of the border of the TV. As Oli mentions in this question HDTV resolution issue the overscan problem is what I am talking here. Although in my case there is no way to configure or tune this with the TV (My case Soneview 32')\nMore information in How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\n\nA: It turned out in my case that the selected Mode (size of screen / refresh rate) was not accepted by my LCD screen.\nSo in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, I added the following line in the Device section which you could also set in the 'Screen' section:\nOption \"metamodes\" \"800x600\"\n\nAfter doing\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nThe display was no longer black and I could use the Nvidia configuration tool.\nAfter trying some options, I was able to use the full resolution by selecting a low refresh rate.\nAfter writing the settings, the following line appeared in xorg.conf:\nOption \"metamodes\" \"1280x1024_60 +0+0\"\n\nin Section Screen (the other option was removed).\nThe new line says to use resolution 1280x1024 with refresh rate 60.\n", "Q: Dash search function does not work in 11.10 after upgrade \nPossible Duplicate:\nDash search function doesn't work \n\nThe search function does not work in dash after upgrading from 11.04 to 11.10.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Could this be a duplicate of Dash search function does not work.

KVM or virtual box for using windows on ubuntu 64 bit?\nI dont know much about KVM and I have used XP on Ubuntu 10.10 32 bit using virtual box,and it is very easy to use and along with guest additions you will have usb support too.\nDoes KVM have any GUI?\nWhat would be recommended configuration of pc,if i would like to run software like matlab, photoshop, etc on the windows virtual machine.\n\nA: At least for the time being, Virtualbox is the best solution to virtualize Windows desktops. It has support for 3D and 2D acceleration which improves the user experience. It also has easy support for USB. I also think the configuration GUI is a little bit more user friendly than virt-manager, though that's a nice GUI as well. \nI've been told that we'll get SPICE in 12.04, and that may change things, but for now, go with Virtualbox. \n\nA: this question will open a debate about what is better than other but anyway.....\nThe answer for your first question is well explain in server fault section\nwell in my opinion VirtualBox is the guy for you.....\nKVM\nwell kvm is more complex....KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although work is underway to get the required changes upstream.\nUsing KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.\nThe kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux, as of 2.6.20.\nKVM is open source software. \nPre-installation checklist\nCheck that your CPU supports hardware virtualization\nTo run KVM, you need a processor that supports hardware virtualization. Intel and AMD both have developed extensions for their processors, deemed respectively Intel VT-x (code name Vanderpool) and AMD-V (code name Pacifica). To see if your processor supports one of these, you can review the output from this command:\negrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo\n\nor\negrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo\n\nIf 0 it means that your CPU doesn't support hardware virtualization.\nIf 1 (or more) it does - but you still need to make sure that virtualization is enabled in the BIOS. \nYes KVM have a GUI :\napt-get install virt-manager \n\n", "Q: 'select file' dialog is always shown at an incorrect position For some reason the 'select file' dialog is always shown at an incorrect position - it is always shifted to the right bottom corner.

I chose to not install the ATI proprietary drivers and simply work with the generic ones.\nAfter my upgrade to 11.10 I noticed that after installing the ATI drivers (not the post-release ones, as apparently people have been having issues with Unity), my graphics card is working well. However, the Unity plugin was unchecked in Compiz. I have rechecked it but nothing has changed. No matter what I check or uncheck in compiz (like wobbly windows), there is no visual effect (these effects all worked with the generic drivers). Even my desktops are in the a straight line format and not in the 2x2 orientation, which gives problems when I press Super+S.\nIs there something I need to do to activate Unity again? Should I reset it? Any other advice will be appreciated.\n\nA: You may be running Unity 2D - I would log out and click on the cog next to your password entry box, ensure you select Ubuntu as your desktop that way when you log in you will use Unity Shell if it has been enabled previously in CCSM.\nIt's a simple way to check before you try to purge then reinstall Unity......\n", "Q: Problem Selecting Partition to Install I am trying to install Ubuntu 11.10 alongside Windows XP.  When I am prompted where I want to install Ubuntu, the three options to select from are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu alongside Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition\n\n*Overwrite Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition with Ubuntu\n\n*Something else\n\n\nWhen I selection option 1, by default Ubuntu Installer selects the 1TB external hard drive that I have connected to the computer.  There appears to be an option to select another hard drive, however, I cannot use it to change to another drive.  In other words, the drop down list does not work.\nWhat I want to be able to do is to install Ubuntu on another (internal) 320GB hard drive that I have purchased for this very reason.  My problem here is that I am not certain how to partition it for Ubuntu using option 3.  I know that I will require a / partition and a /boot partition, however, I am not sure how much to allocate to each.  Furthermore, there appears to be more file systems to select from.  Which one do I use for each partition I create?  Also, the intended target drive is currently formatted with NTFS.  Do I need to manually delete and re-create the partition to ext2 before I am able to install Ubuntu?\nFYI - My current configuration is as follows:\n/dev/sda\n  /dev/sda1   fat16    32MB\n  /dev/sda2   ntfs    160GB\n/dev/sdb\n  /dev/sdb1   ntfs    320GB\n/dev/sdc\n  /dev/sdc5   fat32  1000GB\n\nNote that the /dev/sda1 is the partition reserved for EISA (whatever that is), /dev/sda2 is the partition that contains the Windows XP Home Edition, /dev/sdb1 is the new internal hard drive that I intend to install Ubuntu, and /dev/sdc5 is the external drive which is used as a backup drive only.  For some reason, Windows XP uses this external drive to store temporary/configuration files for software that is installed on /dev/sd2.\nAny help/advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: I found Illustrated Dual Boot guide to Installing Ubuntu in Hard Disk Two quite informative, and it helped me set up a dual boot on two separate drives on my main PC.\nIt references 10.10 but the steps are no different for 11.10.\n\nA: Start Ubuntu from a Live CD/USB. Start gparted, then make sure that you've got one partition set as 'unallocated. That should be the partition /dev/sdb1 in your case. You can easily unallocate it by just removing it. When that is done, you can easily start 'Install Ubuntu 11.10' without restarting your computer. Do that, and there will be an option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nEDIT: You don't need to set the partition types manually, by the way. Ubuntu will do that for you, as well as setting / and /boot/ etcetera.\n", "Q: OpenVPN with IPv6 I have a tun OpenVPN server running in routed mode which was set up on a Ubuntu server and I know that Ubuntu's build of OpenVPN has support for the IPv6 for quite a while now but it didn't get much of my interest to fiddle around with it until my server provider recently provided me with IPv6.\nSo I'd like to know how do you configure OpenVPN server to enable support for IPv6?\n\nA: If you're using OpenVPN 2.1 or 2.2 you can find what you're looking for here.\nBernhardt Schmidt has also put together a package for Ubuntu that includes the IPv6 payload patch integrated with OpenVPN.\nSince this question is old, hope this is still relevant.\n", "Q: dpkg: How to remove a package and all other packages which depend on it? I tried to remove KDE from my system.\nWhen I run dpkg -r kdebase-bin, it says kdebase-data depends on it. So how can I remove all the packages related to KDE?\n\nA: Unlike apt-get, aptitude can recursively remove packages which were installed as dependencies, but which are no longer depended on when the requested removal happens.  You have to have installed those packages with aptitude in order for this to work, though.  \nThere are also tools like deborphan which can identify packages which may no longer be necessary on your system, even if you didn't use aptitude to install them.  However, you have to supply it with a list of packages you do want on your system, but it's usually a quick job (there will be fewer packages it has to ask about than you might imagine).\n\nA: Usually one uses a higher-level utility instead of dpkg. You can use apt-get to remove a package and all its dependencies.\napt-get remove <package>\n\n\nA: dpkg -r --force-depends  $pkg\napt-get install -f\n\n\nA: To remove package and its dependencies, use purge\nCheck all dependencies with following command\n# sudo dpkg --list | grep <package-name>\n\nRemove packages and its dependencies\n# sudo apt purge <package>\n\n", "Q: Any news about a Grooveshark scope for the Music lens? It would be fantastic to have the ability to search for and select music from my Grooveshark account right there within the Dash.  \nI was under the impression this scope would be created during the Ubuntu App Developer Week (Sept. 5th-9th).  It was listed in the agenda --->> http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2011/09/01/ubuntu-11-10-development-update-9/\nHas anyone seen this loose in the wild yet?\n\nA: Yes!  To install the Grooveshark lens in Unity open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:scopes-packagers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-scope-grooveshark\n\nFound on http://www.webupd8.org/2011/11/grooveshark-scope-for-unity-music-lens.html\n\"David Callé has released a Grooveshark scrope for the Unity Music lens which lets you search for music on Grooveshark from Dash. The new scope uses the free Grooveshark API and clicking on a search result opens a new tab in your default browser, playing the selected song.\nAccording to David, there are a few known issues though, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*the results open in different tabs and aren't enqueued\n\n*results in the local collection are not deduplicated\n\n*some searches don't display any results due to some encoding errors\n\n*sometimes cover art isn't displayed the first time you search for something\"\n\n\nThanks to Andrew and David\n", "Q: Gnome Shell close, etc. buttons look I switched to Gnome Shell and edited gconf settings desktop>gnome>shell>windows button_layout=:minimize,maximize,close\nThe buttons are there, but they don't use the Gnome Shell theme anymore, but rather look like the ones in Unity (small round buttons, with close being orange and the other two white).\nHow do I make the buttons look like they should again?\n\nA: You have to restore your windows and gtk theme, install the gnome-tweak-tool and choose for all theme Adwaita. You can also enable the gnome-shell-extensions-user-themes in order to change your themes more easily. You can find a ppa with the extentions and instructions here.\n", "Q: Is there a taskbar applet to show the status of a remote host? At the end of the day I would like to be able to copy files to my home PC just in case I feel inspired to work on them in the evening. But I only want to do this if the PC is on already. (I can remote wake-on-lan the PC but I don't want to always be doing that).\nI would like some taskbar applet that shows the status of the PC and whether I can ssh into it or not. Obviously it would also be interesting to have an idea as to how long it is on for whilst I am at work as that gives a good indication of whether anyone is in or not. However being able to unobtrusively copy files to the remote machine is the main objective.\nPerhaps another approach is to run rsync on cron and if the remote host is not up then I guess it will fail. Is that correct?\nIf anyone else has ideas on how to best sync a work and home PC then please do tell.\n\nA: I think the simplest approach is to forget about taskbar applets or detecting the state of the work machine, and use a third-party syncing service. Ubuntu One is the native client and Dropbox is another fine choice. Configure the same account on the home and work machines and you will have access to the files whenever you like.\nThere are some caveats to this. First, you said you want to 'unobtrusively' copy files. If someone is sitting at the work machine and you save a new file (or version) they may see the Dropbox icon change as it syncs, or an Ubuntu one NotifyOSD message briefly show. These aren't secret or stealthy ways of moving files, if that's important to you.\nThe second issue is security. If you have a requirement to encrypt the files in transit (you mentioned SSH) then you should know that neither service encrypts data by default. That's not too hard to overcome.

The actions in the menu you're referring to are constructed from this list, which does not include a restart item and isn't extensible using configuration files.\nIf you're feeling ambitious and want to patch in a restart menu item for yourself, creating a panel_session_manager_request_restart analog of this function would be the place to start.\n", "Q: Can I disable the alt+window+right click behaviour for editing panels in Gnome Classic? In Gnome Classic 11.10, when you want to make edits to the Gnome Panel, you have to press Alt + Super and then right click. \nI believe in some cases it's just Alt and right click, but because of setting change to get Compiz to run on my machine, it became Alt + Super and right click. I believe this is a known issue.\nIn any case, whether it's Alt + Super and right click, or just Alt and right click, this new key combination thing is totally unneeded as far as I'm concerned. I was perfectly fine with just right clicking to edit the panel, as was the case in Gnome 2.2.\nIs there a way to change this behaviour so I can edit the panel just by right clicking and not having any key combination?\n\nA: Alt+MouseClick is used by Compiz for moving and resizing windows, hence it conflicts with the GNOME Panel that uses Alt+RightClick for bringing up the context menu.\nIt is a conflict that occurs because both wants to use Alt+Mouse. Using Alt+Super+Mouse is a workaround that prevents Compiz from capturing the key-combination and lets GNOME Panel get it.\nYou can remap the key-combination for Compiz to use another key than Alt. I remapped it to use Super instead.\ngconftool-2 --set --type string /apps/metacity/general/mouse_button_modifier '<Super>'\n", "Q: Some keyboard keys not working since upgrade to 11.10 II.04 was working perfectly on my Acer Aspire 3050 laptop, until I upgraded a couple of days ago.  Yesterday, I was unable to type in my password as only about half the keys on kb are working.  I logged in on a guest account, but couldn't do anything or access Internet because I needed to type in my pw to do so.\nDecided to do a fresh install of 11.04. however I can't enter BIOS using the designated key (F2) to make it boot from CD.  Guessing that it's one of the non-functioning keys. :(\nCan anybody help out here?  Thank you in advance.\n\nA: If your keyboard doesn't work while loading the BIOS (that loads before Ubuntu and is OS independent), it's not an Ubuntu problem, not related to any update. I can't think of any way in which a OS can change how the BIOS manages keyboard. Installing another OS (Ubuntu 11.04 or Windows) is not going to solve this.\nThe most likely cause is some hardware related problem. You can try to attach an USB keyboard to the computer and enter the BIOS from it.\nIf you don't fear screwdrivers and the laptop is not under warranty you should check the connection of the keyboard to the main-board. Otherwise is time to get it to a computer repair shop.\n\nA: It's a hardware problem, but likely a very simple one.  Check your Fn key isn't stuck down, which on an Acer Aspire laptop would change the behavior of the letters UIOPJKLM, F1-F12, and the arrow keys.

I am rather new to Unity, I have only started using it after upgrading to 11.10 several days ago, and one thing really worries me. I started to miss incoming messages in Empathy and Skype because sometimes I'm not there when they arrive. And when I'm back, I don't use the launcher because I have a maximized window, so I don't see that there are windows requesting my attention.\nIs there a way to make the launcher remind me of such windows? Or maybe make it stick them out halfway like it does when an event happens and keep them like that until I click on them?\n\nA: You can use Recent Notifications Indicator for catching up missed notifications. It will display a postbox icon in your notification area.\nTo install, use the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:jconti/recent-notifications\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-notifications\n\nTo start the indicator you have to restart Unity. The simplest way to do this is just to log out and log back in.\nOnce you have any incoming notifications, the icon turns from „white” to green and you can use its pull down menu to review the messages.\n\nA: This seems to be a empathy user interface bug as Pidgin does not exhibit the same behaviour.

Some googling led me to believe that I should install:\nxserver-xorg-input-multitouch \nto do that.  This seems to be incorrect and may have messed up my system.\nEver since I installed this, not only does my install still not have multi-touch, but my touch pad occasionally does not work, I have some booting freezes, and am asked to partial upgrade.  (Apparently fiddling with xserver is some kind of partial upgrade, I take it?)\nAnyway, before partial upgrading, I saw that this package would be uninstalled, but no new xserver-xorg-input would be installed to replace it.  (However, 172 other packages will be added, including CUPS, Empathy, and gedit, which all seem to currently work fine.)\nGiven that it may be removing something important in xserver-xorg, and that it may be installing new(?) versions of things that already were upgraded for 11.10 and working fine (and as far as I know, /not/ removed), is it safe to do this partial upgrade or not?\n(Sidenote, I've consulted\nUpgrade manager wants me to do a partial upgrade\nand\nPartial Upgrade\nand I think my case is a little different, because these cases seemed to genuinely start an upgrade and finish part-way through it, whereas I just installed an inappropriate version of something, and want to get back to the right one.)\nThanks!\n\nA: For anyone else's benefit in a similar position: briefly, this was a mess.  I had apparently blindly installed some bleeding edge repositories to update my xorg for the sake of a multitouch screen, so the partial upgrade took me into the future.  And the future was a terrifying place where things didn't work.\nI eventually discovered I needed to roll back xorg and xserver-xorg, by comparing my installation with a brand new ubuntu install thanks to some advice from this post.\nHowever, since then, I still have some issues cropping up, such as an inability to take screenshots, and being unable to connect to wifi at boot without first connecting to eth0 (haven't confirmed, but I suspect it's the same lib).  \nI have traced these errors to xorg and also having a scary future version of libglib2 installed, namely 2.31.0 instead of 2.30.0.  That has not yet been solved, but has been posted as its own question here.\nThe short answer I will say, then, in response to this question is: NO, DO NOT PARTIAL UPGRADE!  And more importantly, if you're seeking multi-touch, watch which repositories you install to get it---don't just follow forums.  There is a known bug with xorg-edgers that pushes you down to unity-2d, and in my experience, that caused major dependency problems I have yet to resolve.\n", "Q: Picasa would not log into my account I have installed Wine on 11.10, but for some reason Picasa does not detect the internet connection, which exist system wide, except for Picasa\nAny suggestions?\nHi, I have reinstalled picasa 3.0 for linux after having replaced ubuntu 11.04 by 11.10.

My family PC has Windows Vista and lately it has became unusable, having strange errors and taking hours to do anything at all, so I'm installing Ubuntu 11.10 alongside it.  I went into GParted to resize the Vista partition but found that it had an exclamation point in a red circle next to it:\n\nI tried to resize it but the Resize/Move button was grayed out.  I thought that this might have to do with the exclamation point so I looked at the information and found a load of errors:\n\nWhat does the exclamation point mean?  How can I resize my partition?\nUPDATE 1\nI booted into Safe Mode with Command Prompt in Vista as suggested by eug and ranchkdsk c: /F /R (/F Fixed errors on the disk, /R Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information) and got:\nChkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process.  Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/)\n\nWhen I reboot it doesn't run chkdsk, I'm selecting Safe Mode with Command Prompt again because I can't boot normally.  How can I stop it being used?\nUPDATE 2\nI tried doing what Luis suggested.  Here is the terminal output:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda3\nMounting volume... OK\nProcessing of $MFT and $MFTMirr completed successfully.\nNTFS volume version is 3.1.\nNTFS partition /dev/sda3 was processed successfully.\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nNote, selecting 'ntfs-3g' instead of 'ntfsprogs'\nntfs-3g is already the newest version.\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\n\nI still cannot resize the partition.  Ntfsfix doesn't look like it did anything and ntfsprogs is already installed.  I can access the hard drive and do backups with the Ubuntu Live CD which I'm using now.  Any other suggestions?\nUPDATE 3\nI attempted to use the ntfsresize command but I got an error:\nERROR: Volume is scheduled for check.\nRun chkdsk /f and please try again, or see option -f.\n\nThis is because I ran chkdsk in Vista Safe Mode with Command Prompt and it couldn't do it because it was in use but offered to do it at the next reboot.  I reboot and I get to the menu to the menu to choose whether to Start Windows Normally, Safe Mode, etc instead of checking the disk.  Is there any way I can unschedule?\nEDIT\nI just found out that I could use the -f option to force it.  It failed and told me to run chkdsk /f in Windows and then reboot twice.  But the chkdsk program is in the partition I am trying to check so it says it is in use.\n\nA: Firs try this from within Ubuntu (In the terminal):\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sda3\nIt will try to fix as much as it can. If it does fix the problems the do the following before the disk dies on you:\nsudo apt-get install ntfsprogs \nwhich should give you support for NTFS filesystem in Gparted.\nThen just open gparted and resize/check the filesystem. This is all assuming that the check with ntfsfix went fine and the check with gparted did also.\nIf both go bad and you still can not boot with the ntfs partition I suggest looking for another PC than you can connect the hard drive, fix the problem there or do a backup.\n\nA: I turned on the PC and didn't realize it didn't have the Ubuntu CD in so it tried to boot into Windows.  When I came back to it I realized it had started running chkdsk, because before I couldn't boot into safe mode I scheduled it to run chkdsk.  After it completed the Vista partition no longer had an exclamation mark next to it and I am able to shrink it.  It's currently shrinking now and its been on the real resize stage for a while but apparently it's normal if it takes a long time. (Extra info: I did cancel it because I didn't think anything was happening but it messed up the partition.  Somehow chkdsk was scheduled again so I was able to resize it again.  I'll be sure not to cancel it this time.)\nSo if anyone else has this problem, run chkdsk /r at Safe Mode with Command Prompt, or the recovery console if you have it (I don't).\n", "Q: Always visible keyboard without other windows above or under it I have a small touch-netbook with Ubuntu 11.10.

I want to install an SSH server on it, so I can reach it from home and even from my Android via ssh. But I haven't got any experience on creating an ssh server. \nThe machine has a dynamic IP. I don't want any other ssh users, installing it only for myself will be enough for me.\nWhere should I start? What tools do I need and how would I configure them?\n\nA: You could get a hostname via a service like http://www.noip.com/ and then setup a ssh server.\nyou would then connect via e.g.\nssh USERNAME@HOSTNAME.no-ip.biz\n\n\nA: To get started with ssh in general, install openssh-server.\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nOn the next restart, this should start up automatically. To connect to the computer remotely, just enter the following in a remote terminal, substituting the ALL-CAPS names for your own:\nssh USERNAME@IPADDRESS\n\nNow, to take care of the dynamic ip forcing you to recheck the IP all the time:\nGet a free account on dyndns.com and choose the name you want to type when you connect.\nOnce that is done, install \"ddclient\" on the server machine. This will automatically update the IP address for you with dyndns.\nsudo apt-get install ddclient\n\nWhen you run it, it will ask you a series of questions, so have your username, password, and the URL you chose earlier ready to type in. It should also automatically add itself to startup. \nThat should be it. Now when you ssh, just use the URL you chose instead of your IPADDRESS since this should automatically update if the IP changes. \nIf you have a router, make sure to forward port 22 to your server! There are lots of guides on this at portforward.com for your specific router.\n\nA: check out this link:\nhttp://www.raspberryanywhere.com/\nPerhaps it can be of some help. I'v been using the service from several weeks and it works great!\nThe link provide a simple software teamviewer like to access your raspberry board anywhere you are. Furthermore, you can use your usual SSH client; they just provide a virtual address to connect to your board via SSH or HTTP . It worths a try for sure!\n\nA: Installing and using ssh is easy. You can install it from here: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/oneiric/openssh-server/. \nOnce it's installed, it'll run and run automatically at boot. All the users on the local machine will be able to use it. You'll still need to fix your network so you can connect to it, but that doesn't really have anything to do with ssh. If it has a public IP, then you can use something like dyndns.org and ddclient to get a dynamic name for it. If it doesn't have a public IP, then you'll also need to configure your network to forward traffic to it. \n\nA: You need dynamic DNS client on your PC (or router) and optionally open port 22 on your router to the Ubuntu machine if PC is behind it. Then you can reach your machine via some custom name instead of IP.\n\nA: you can use SSH by using xmmpp / jabber protocol. so you can take access just by google talk on your desktop or mobile phone e.g android.\nNo need IP Public\nNo need special setting\nJust Install and run as a service.\nI made a script (tested on my raspian OS in Raspberry Pi) so u can easily install robotito. this is the steps\n1.

I don't like very much Gnome-shell but I'm doing my best effort. But one thing that I can't find is how to select a different windows or pick something from the left dock with the keyboard.\nI mean, you hit the Win key, and the Activity panels shows. Then, the most obvious is that with the keyboard I can pick some window, with tab change from Windows to Applications, etc.\nBut NO, seems that I can press a key to show the Activities screen, but then I have the pick the mouse and click in the place that I want to go.\nRecently I went to presentation about accessibility in a Google Developer Day, and the presenter says that if we forget everything that she says, we have just to remember \"you have to unplug your mouse and be able to use your application\".\nGnome 3 says hundred of times that is the \"most accessible desktop\", but how they can miss use the system with just the keyboard?\n\nA: I'm not aware of a way to switch from the Windows screen to the Applications screen, but there are ways to launch applications and switch windows using the keyboard in gnome-shell.\nAlt-Tab\nYour question only mentions the Activites pane, but I'll mention this method for completeness, and because it most closely matches the behaviour of several other environments: To switch between applications, use Alt+Tab. To switch between multiple windows of the same application, use Alt+`. Note for non-US-keyborad users: To switch between multiple windows of the same application, use Alt+key above Tab.\nSearching in the Activities pane\nThe \"type to search\" field in the top right of the Activities pane is one of my favourite parts of gnome-shell. To launch an application without touching the mouse, press the \"Win key\" (here I'll call it Super) and type the first few letters of the application's name. A list of applications matching your text will appear. Use the up and down arrows to highlight the one you want, and press Enter. For example, if I press Super and type \"libr\", the applications in the LibreOffice suite are listed for me, and I can select one.\nThe same method applies to switching windows: if you select an application that's already running, the shell will switch you to that application instead of opening a new instance of it. For example, if I already have Firefox open, and it press Super and type \"firef\" and press Enter, I get one of my existing Firefox windows instead of a new one.\nSo what if you want a new instance of an application that's already running? Select the application you want and press Ctrl+Enter.\nThe Window Navigator extension\nThis is an extension that allows you to select windows in the activities pane using keystrokes instead of mouse clicks.\nThese instructions explain how to enable a PPA with some gnome-shell extensions. The relevant commands are as follows:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions-windows-navigator\n\nAfter installing, restart gnome-shell (Alt+F2, type \"r\" and press Enter). If you use gnome-tweak-tool, you may need to launch it and enable the Window Navigator extension under Shell Extensions.\nOnce the extension is installed and enabled, you can hold Alt in the Activities pane to see a number hover over each window. Press a number key to switch to its corresponding window.\nUpdate\nThere are plenty of other tips and explanations in the Gnome Project's GnomeShell Cheat Sheet.\n\nA: I agree that Gnome Shell has ways to go before it's really accessible. I don't really understand what the question is, but I would like to recommend that you try Unity 2D if you like Unity but feel it's slow. Unity 2D is quite nice and has the features from Unity, but is much faster on some hardware. \n", "Q: Touchpad doesn't work after logging in The touchpad of my laptop fails to work soon after I login to Ubuntu.

Most of the time I can switch between the workspaces without a problem using ctrl+alt+left/right/up/down, but at least once a day, I manage to hit some other combination that causes all of the windows to move to workspace 1 and resize all of the terminal windows.  This is extremely frustrating because I have to stop what I was doing and move everything back where I had it and resize the windows again.\nWhat combination of things is causing this to happen and how can I disable it?\nEdit:   I just had this happen after unlocking my screen as well, so it may not be directly related to switching my workspaces...\nEdit (Jan 11, 2012):   Updates are current as of earlier this week.   .xsession-errors.old has a good amount of information in it, but I don't know what is significant and what is just noise, and it doesn't contain any timestamps, so I have no idea when what happened.\nThe last block of lines from .xsession-errors.old:\n(indicator-multiload:1791): libappindicator-WARNING **: Unable to send signal for NewIcon: The connection is closed\ng_dbus_connection_real_closed: Remote peer vanished with error: Underlying GIOStream returned 0 bytes on an async read (g-io-error-quark, 0).

The underlying X server may be the root cause for this.  This shouldn't happen. This may be best treated as a bug report to Ubuntu, for this I suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/default/apport and set enabled=1\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Log in and start doing stuff\n\n*When the crash happens, you'll get a prompt to file a bug, follow the instructions.\n\n*Afterwards, disable apport (enabled=0) as it consumes extra resources.\n\n\nAs a way to stop this from giving you trouble, I can suggest two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the \"classic\" environment, which doesn't use Unity or stress the graphics hardware so much.\n\n*Upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10, things may be more stable, and if you keep experiencing the same problem, you can switch to Unity 2d, which is much closer to the experience you're used to.\n\n", "Q: Banshee never connects to a radio stream on the first try I have 17 different radio streams. I'd like to be able to use the alarm extension so I could wake up to one of them playing.\nHowever, I can't do this because Banshee (2.2 daily build) never, and I do mean never, connects to any of them on the first try.\nIf I click to play any radio stream, on the first try it says \"Contacting...\", and then it says \"Idle\", and a little X mark appears beside the name of the station.\nHowever, if I click it a second time, it works fine.\nIt always goes like this. Without fail. I can never connect on the first try, and I can almost always connect on the second try.\nI don't know how close together the two tries have to be in order to work.\nWhat I do know, though, is if I use the Alarm extension to start playing a radio stream in the morning, nothing happens in the morning because it attempts to connect and then fails and gives up trying.\nAny advice on how to solve this would be appreciated.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*A thread for this question on the Banshee mailing list\n\n*A bug report with debug output from Banshee\n\nA: I have encountered this problem in Banshee as well. I also use the daily builds (as of this past week or so again) - and in my experience it seems to mainly occur in the daily builds and not in the Stable release.\nMy guess to the cause\nTo my knowledge there is no real \"fix\" that you can apply, because it seems to be both a problem in Banshee and in the radio stations themselves. When I was still on Windows, this also used to happen with some radio stations. It seems to be a server side issue (partially), in that when you first try to connect, it fails and thus the music player marks it as unavailable (hence the x).\nOn the other hand, once the music player is told to try again, it finds the station - apparently after the server allots \"space\" to your player (that's just my guess).\nThe real answer:\nI would suggest you simply wait on a fix from the Banshee developers, which will probably include having the player retry the station a few times. It is very unlikely that there is anything you can do on your end.\nYou could also try the stable build of Banshee, which seems to do better in this situation.\n\nAlternate solution:\nAnother option may be to use another player, such as Clementine (for example), which may be able to play the station even if it reports itself as down at first (I have not tried this). You could use either a cron job or a timer application (there are numerous timer apps available) for the alarm functionality.\n", "Q: How can I observe what the kernel's doing when it tries to boot up a wireless card?

Is there a command to remove all files and subdirectories in a directory without deleting the directory?\nFor example if I have directory dontDeleteMe with subdirectories 1, 2, 3 and each subdirectory has a few pictures in it, how can I remove the subdirectories 1, 2, and 3 and all the files in the them, without removing the parent directory dontDeleteMe?\n\nA: To remove everything in a directory without removing the directory, type in:\nrm -rfv dontDeleteMe/*\n\nPlease note, the /* part is very important. If you put a space before the *, it will delete all your files in your current directory.   \nAlso, be very careful playing with rm, -r and * all in the same command. They can be a disastrous combination.    \nUpdate:  Okay, I realized if you do have hidden/dot files [filenames with dots at the beginning, e.x. .hidden] then this will leave those files intact.  \nSo really, the simplest solution to the original question is: \nrm -rfv dontDeleteMe && mkdir dontDeleteMe\n\nAnother one would be to use find's -exec option or pipe to xargs (below):\nfind dontDeleteMe/* -print0  | xargs -0  rm -rv\n\n\nA: find /dontDeleteMe/ -xdev -depth -mindepth 1 -exec rm -Rf {} \\;\n\nUse xdev option to delete files only within device boundary.\n\nA: Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) ant type this:\nfind somedir -mindepth 1 -delete\n\nThis will match all files and directories within somedir and its (grand-)children including \"hidden\" dot files but excluding somedir itself because of -mindepth 1, then -delete them.\n\nA: To delete (in terminal) all files and subdirectories except for the base directory named \"dontdelete\":\nrm -rf dontdelete/*\n\n\nA: You can use find with the -delete flag:\nfind dontDeleteMe/* -delete\n\nThe /* is important as it tells find to search only INSIDE the folder called \"dontDeleteMe\".\nAlso ensure that the -delete flag is at the end of the find command.\n\nA: The only reason rm -r ./* do not always work is because you can have hidden files and/or folder that are not matched by *.\nTo this end, bash provide an option to make * match everything, even hidden objects:\ncd dont-delete-me\nshopt -s dotglob\nrm -r ./*\n\nIt can be useful to reset dotglob to its default (unset) state, if you keep on using the shell where you executed the above commands:\nshopt -u dotglob \n\n\nA: rm -rf  directory/{.*,/*}\n\nWhat says: \nRemove all files starting with . in \"directory\" and all other files too.\nThough as kindly noted by Neftas this solution is not safe! \nSafer solution is:\n rm -rf directory/!(.|..)\n\n\nA: There is an even simpler answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd dontDeleteMe\n\n*rm -rf *\nBasic system administration lecture time: Be sure to pay attention to where you are when you use sweeping commands like this. \nI can't say that enough.

Since I'm using it on Arch Linux, I don't have any right-click option for that.\nI tried to edit ~/.config/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf and add the line root_dir = ~/new/folder (as suggested in this thread), but the file is automatically reverted to its previous state. Also, the command u1sdtool hangs and does apparently nothing - I have to use Ctrl + C to close it.

I'm having a problem with a couple of programs that have launchers in unity but then create a separate icon after launched.  Is is possible for the launcher to track the windows it spawns to organize better?  Or is this a bug in Unity itself?\n\nIt might not matter but this specific program is a mono program, and the icon spawned is listed as the panel.\n\nA: What's happening\nProblems like this relate to Unity's application matching framework. To simplify the technical details, program windows and applications are two separate things to Ubuntu. Ubuntu needs to 'guess' which application owns a particular window. And sometimes that guess fails, and a question mark appears in the launcher.\nThe failure may be due to:\n\n\n*\n\n*A bug in BAMF (the application matching framework mentioned above).\n\n*A faulty application description (aka '.desktop' file).\n\n*The lack of any application description at all. Executables that launch windows do not inherently have this metadata.\n\n\nThe application shown in the question (KeePass2) suffers from a type 1 problem that has been reported to the appropriate bug tracker.\nExamples of problems\nThe below examples are technical, aimed at programmers who want their own application displaying properly in the Ubuntu launcher.\nProblem 3 – No application description\nIn order for an application to integrate with Unity—that is to say, be searchable in the Dash and placed in the launcher—it needs to have a desktop entry. Such entries are placed in the /usr/share/applications/, /usr/local/share/applications/, and $HOME/.local/share/applications/ (the latter two being for third party software, system-wide and user-only respectively). They end with a .desktop extension and follow this basic format:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=My Application's Name\nIcon=/file/path/of/my/icon\nExec=/file/path/of/my/executable\n\nThis entry starts a program by calling the Exec executable. Whenever that program displays a window or dialog, Unity will notice that its executable \"belongs\" to this application description, and use the given Name and Icon in the launcher.\nThis is a barebones example. The formal specification covers many advanced features.\nProblem 2 – Faulty application description\nLet us assume that my_app.desktop exists in a valid application directory, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*/file/path/of/my/icon does not exist in the filesystem.\n\n*/file/path/of/my/icon is not an image.\n\n*the entry uses some incorrect syntax or invalid tags.\n\n\nIn any of the above case, Ubuntu will be unable to properly list the application window in the launcher.\nProblem 1 – A bug in BAMF\nAs of Ubuntu 11.10, BAMF has a number of bugs that prevents correct application matching. Common (temporary) pitfalls include:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Exec path being a symbolic link rather than a regular file\n\n*The executable being a script that launches the main executable.\n\n\nIn these cases, programmers have no option but to use a workaround, such as removing the symbolic link abstraction, or linking to the executable directly. Neither of these are required by the desktop entry specification itself.\n\nA: The window can only be matched to the application if the WM_CLASS property has been set.\nTo do this in X11 you use:\nXSetClassHint( display, window, &class_hints );\n\nYou need to pass a pointer to a XClassHint structure with field 'res_name' and 'res_class'.\n\nA: I had a few issues with 16.04 including the greyed out icons and sometimes the touchpad would become erratic (Acer V15 nitro) also the software centre (maybe other icons too) would not open from the icon (only from a terminal command) . I found a recommendation somewhere to uninstall and reinstall the gnome software. Since I did this the whole system has been 100% stable no more greyed out icons and works perfectly. It looked scary initially when I rebooted after this change - lots of system messages on reboot- so do it at your own risk.\nsudo apt-get autoremove gnome-software && sudo apt-get install gnome-software\n\n", "Q: How to turn off Compiz's \"drag to maximize\" behaviour?

But when I connect to the same location via samba as \nsmb://serveraddr/sharedfolder\nby providing my credentials, I have the privileges to write without being the root.\nHow can I make it to let me write to the mounted folder?\n\nA: Don't use smbfs, the new protocol's name is cifs and its part of the package cifs-tools (install it if you did not already.\nInstead use this line in your fstab\n//server/share /mnt/mountname cifs username=server_user,password=user_password,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=07‌​77 0 0\n\nWhere\nserver = your server that you are trying to access\nshare = mapped share on that server\n/mnt/mountname = any folder that you created with sudo /mnt/<folder_name>\nusername = the name of the user on that server that can access the mount\npassword = the password for that user\n\nAfter that you can test with sudo mount -a, if you dont get any faults you can safely reboot to find your shares mounted in /mnt/<folder_name>.\nTo use a credentials file instead of the username and password parameters on the fstab you can create a file with those 2 lines so that your username and password are not explicitly shown in the fstab\nsudo nano /etc/cifspwd\nAdd these lines to the file\nusername=<username on server>\npassword=<password for that username>\n\nPress ctrl+x keys and when asked press y to save the file.\nSecure it with\nsudo chmod 600 /etc/cifspwd\nUse this line instead of the previous\n//server/share /mnt/mountname cifs credentials=/etc/cifspwd,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=07‌​77 0 0\n\nAfter this it will be safe to reboot and you mount should be mounted and your details secured.\n", "Q: Why is Firefox on Ubuntu choppier than Firefox on Windows? I have nvidia driver on both OSs. Same FF version. Both with smooth scrolling enabled. Using FF in windows is a big joy! It's so smooth, like a hot knife slicing butter. Ubuntu's FF is somewhat choppier. I realize this may be the driver as sometimes i see tearing in Ubuntu. I use v 11.10.\nAm I the only one with such a problem?\n\nA: I was getting graphic lag as well, but with the Gnome Shell. I read on a forum that changing the driver would solve the problem and it did! Let us see if this can solve your problem as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Additional Drivers application.\n\n*Select the recommended nvidia driver for usage.\n\n*Follow the instructions issued by the application.\n\n\nIf I remember correctly, you will have to restart your computer in order for it to integrate the drivers into the kernel, and the next time you log in your problem might be solved. \n\nA: You may also want to consider disabling IPV6 in Firefox.  I find that this speeds my browsing experience up considerably.  As an experiment, try loading Opera or Chromium to see if your browsing experience improves significantly.  If it does, you way want to check out these directions - \n\nA: Finally FF is smooth. And other graphic intense apps too.

What is the proper way to set DPI value now? gnome-tweak allows to set only scaling factor, which is unsatisfactory and also not all applications take that into account (Chrome for example).\nI would like to pass \"-dpi\" flag to Xorg when it starts, but can't find a way to configure \"lightdm\" to do so. Is it possible? \n\nA: There actually is a way:\nChange this line in /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf\nxft-dpi=96\n\nto whatever fits your computer best.\nCaution: It will break the desktops looks, some effects might not be avaliable. This is a bug in in Unity and will hopefully be fixed soon.\n\nA: In /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf, you can override the xserver-command parameter (which usually defaults to simply \"X\").  Here is mine:\nxserver-command=X -dpi 75\n\nThis has the intended effect of scaling my entire desktop, gnome programs included.  Desktop effects are fine, no odd artifacts.  It also sets the xdpyinfo, but xft.dpi must be set separately:\n$ xdpyinfo|grep dots\n  resolution:    75x75 dots per inch\n$ xrdb -query|grep dpi\nXft.dpi:    96\n\nSee madmuffin's answer for how to set Xft.dpi appropriately.\n", "Q: Sound muted when headphones are connected in hp dv4 I'm using a hp dv4 running Ubuntu 11.10. The sound is fine when the speaker is on and the volume control works fine too. But when I plug in the headphones, the sound gets muted. Even if I change the volume to max, the indicator LED show's that its muted. Is this a bug?\n\nA: I have the same issue (also on hp dv4 running 11.10, worked fine on 11.04). I just tried the following and it worked for me.\nGo to 'sound settings' and click on 'output'. There you will see 'analog headphones' for the connector (at the bottom). Change that to 'analog speakers' and you will get sound on your headphones.\nStrange, but it works.\n\nA: In Kubuntu 12.04 after upgrading to Firefox 15 requiring an Adobe Flash upgrade I noticed several of my sound drivers replaced and removed without my authorization. I could use my speakers but when plugging in the headphones the sound muted.\nI found the answer here after an hour of searching.

It has a couple of ethernet ports and a wireless network for my home network (eth5, eth7, eth10 and wlan1). It is connected with a DSL modem in bridged mode giving it a connection to the internet called ppp0. I currently use tc and a simple rate limit (TBF, IIRC) to shape the outgoing traffic (which works great -- no matter how much is uploading, my connection does not increase latency because of it, which is the goal). \nWhat I would like to do is use tc to limit and prioritize my incoming traffic. I know you can't do this without setting a a fake device, using IMQ or IFB. (I believe IFB is the new, \"right\" way to do it.)\nSo, how do I set up IFB so I can I set up IFB so I can set up a simple TBF limit  for now (and later set up bandwidth allocations, like TCP ack packets get a certain guaranteed amount of bandwidth)?\n\nA: This is a good read.

The problem is that vpnc has a tendency to die on me. Is there some way to respawn the vpnc if it dies? There is a nice wiki about process management, but it seems that I cannot really use inittab for my purpose here, or at least not straight forward.\nWhat would be a non hack way to respawn vpnc if it dies while I am connected to the certain wireless?\n\nA: If you've noticed vpnc dies after around the same amount of time being connected, you may want to try to disable DPD:\n\n   --dpd-idle <0,10-86400>\n          Send DPD packet after not receiving anything for <idle> seconds.  Use 0 to disable DPD completely (both ways).\n          Default: 300\n   conf-variable: DPD idle timeout (our side) <0,10-86400>\n\n\n(taken from the vpnc man page)\nThe parameter above (--dpd-idle 0) will disable dead peer detection and avoid the connection stopping if the packets don't reach you in time. You can otherwise set it in your config file as described above.\nI think I'd also edit your startup script a little to avoid unconditionally stopping vpnc \"if it's still active\". You may be running into different state changes than \"up\" and \"down\" (for instance, you have \"hostname\"); for instance when roaming from access point to access point due to signal level changes or otherwise you might get a new \"up\".

In software properties (sudo software-properties-gtk), on tab Updates, check the last option - Release upgrade. It should be set to Normal releases.\nAlso try running sudo update-manager --check-dist-upgrades and make sure you have all packages up-to-date (especially for Update Manager).\nThere are more upgrade strategies at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OneiricUpgrades\nIf nothing of this helps, try updating package information from console - what's the output of sudo apt-get update command?\nEdit: The Maurizio's problem was caused by outdated mirrors.

Is it possible to run different window managers on different screens?\nExample, I want to run a tiling window manager (such as awesome) on one screen, and then I would like to run a stacking window manager (such as Compiz) on another screen.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible. It requires the cooperation of the window manager. The window manager should have an option on its command line or in its configuration file to tell it which screen(s) to manage. For example, fvwm -s 0 tells Fvwm to manage only screen 0 (by default, Fvwm, like every window manager I know, manages all screens).\nIf your window manager doesn't offer a way not to manage all screens, I don't think there's a way to force it from the outside. You would need to modify the source code. The critical change concerns a line like this:\nXSelectInput(dpy, RootWindow(dpy, screen_num), SubstructureRedirectMask);\n\nYou would need to execute this line only on one screen instead of all of them. Depending on the architecture of the window manager, this may be a trivial change or may involve a lot of extra coding.\nNote that I assume you meant screens in the technical sense of the X Window System. If you want multiple displays that you can switch between with Ctrl+Alt+Fn, that's a whole different kettle of fish. Also, having more than one screen on an X display is pretty rare; I won't discuss why or how to do it in this answer.\n", "Q: How can I get media keys working on my keyboard?

However, I used a different username on installation by mistake, and now I've got two home folders: /home/new_user/ and /home/old_user/.\nThe old_user is not registered as a user (it's not listed in the LightDM login screen), and I really just need one user, with my old data and configuration.\nSo: is there a quick way to fix it? As in, get my old_user to be the only user with all my settings back?\nThank you.\n\nA: The best option would be indeed to turn the new user into the old user.\nHave a look at the /etc/passwd file:\nnew_user:x:1000:1000:New User,,,:/home/new_user:/bin/bash\nEdit this line only as root to:\nold_user:x:1000:1000:Old User,,,:/home/old_user:/bin/bash\nThen reset the old users password: passwd old_user as root.\n\nA: You can change the location of the home directory of a user - perhaps that's what you want.

Thank you.\nNB: After getting my normal Dektop back I uninstall CompizConfig Setting Manager for me not to accidentally repeat the same process. I think there is something with the CCSM that is responsible for that problem though.\n\nA: CCSM is buggy (it's a shame Unity relies on that poor application to offer very limited customizability).

Before, one could configure certain options in Gnome 2.x through the ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file.

They do not exist initially so you have to create the directory and files manually. If you create settings.ini add at least a line containing [Settings] in it, otherwise apps will complain about it missing.\nSee /usr/share/theme/[theme_name]/gtk-3.0/*.css files for hints of what you can change.\nMost likely you will want to use gtk.css to override visual settings from the desktop theme with your own preferences. I usually don't edit gtk.css itself but rather append a line saying @import url(\"gtk-mine.css\"); and put my stuff in gtk-mine.css. This way, in case someone ever overwrites that file, I only lose the @import line, not all my personal rules.\nHere's a short example of how to override some scrollbar attributes:\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk-css:\n@import url(\"gtk-mine.css\");\n\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk-mine.css:\n* {\n  -GtkRange-slider-width: 18;\n  -GtkScrollbar-has-forward-stepper: 0;\n  -GtkScrollbar-has-backward-stepper: 0;\n  -GtkScrollbar-has-secondary-forward-stepper: 0;\n  -GtkScrollbar-has-secondary-backward-stepper: 0;\n  -GtkScrollbar-min-slider-length: 30;\n}\n.scrollbar.slider.vertical,\n.scrollbar.button.vertical {\n  border-radius: 4;\n}\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable the automatic download of updates when the internet connection is through a 3G dongle?

I use xmbc to view my tv shows. Before I began using xmbc, I batch downloaded the first few seasons of \"Bleach\". What can I say, I'm an anime fan ;-). These are named: \"bleachxx.mp4\" where xx is the episode number in respect to the whole series, not to the season. so \"bleach21.mp4\" is the 1st episode of the second season and 21st overall. The files themselves are, however, divided into their own season folders. \nI know you can use the \"rename\" command to batch rename files. After much tinkering with it using this guide: http://tips.webdesign10.com/how-to-bulk-rename-files-in-linux-in-the-terminal I got this command:\nrename -n 's/.*(\\d{2}).*$/Bleach S0XE$1/' *\n\nThe problem is that the command will rename all the files into \"Bleach S0XExx\" but because the files have the overall file numbers, bleach52.mp4 --> 'Bleach S03E52.mp4' when there obviously aren't 52 episodes in season 3.\nI would like to know, then, if there is any way to apply mathematical operations to the file renaming. This would solve the problem as I could subtract The number of episodes in the previous seasons by the overall number and essentially get the season number.\nExample: If there are 20 episodes in season 1, then 25-20=5 so the 25th episode is the 5th of season 2 and renaming would carry out as normal.\nSo, is there anyway to change the values of renaming by applying math operations?\nP.S. I'm sorry for the long explanation but I wasn't sure how to or if my question would be clear without it.\n\nA: If you're dedicated enough to tinker with regular expressions (in the example you're provided) then I suggest just to go one step farther and write a small script - say, in Python. This way you'll be able to perform absolutely any transformations to file names.\nI would estimate the python script would be no longer than 15-20 lines long so it's definitely not a huge task. Using just regexps, as you're trying, is much more limited.\nHere's my take on such script:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport os,re\n\nfiles = os.listdir('.')\n\nSEASONS = (\n (1, 1, 3), # the format is - season number, first episode, last episode\n (2, 50,52),\n (3, 53,55),\n (4, 56,99),\n)\n\nfor f in files:\n    # skip all files which are not .mp4\n    if not f.endswith(\".mp4\"):\n        continue\n\n    # find the first number in the filename\n    matches = re.findall(\"\\d+\", f)\n    if not len(matches):\n       print \"skipping\", f\n    num = int(matches[0])\n\n    for season in SEASONS:\n        if num <= season[2]:\n            season_num = season[0]\n            ep_num = num - season[1] + 1\n            new_file_name = \"BleachS%02dE%02d.mp4\" % (season_num, ep_num)\n            # This is for testing\n            print \"%s ==> %s\" % (f, new_file_name)\n            # Uncomment the following when you're satisfied with the test runs\n            # os.rename(f, new_file_name)\n            break\n\nprint \"Done\"\n\nIt looks like I under-estimated the script size (it's 36 lines atm), though I'm sure if you go to stackoverflow with this code, you'll get many suggestions which are much more elegant\nAnd just because I said it can be done in 15 lines... the following is 20 lines, 5 of which is configuration :P\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport os, re, glob\n\nSEASONS = (\n {'num':1, 'first':1, 'last':3}, # the format is - season number, first episode, last episode\n {'num':2, 'first':50, 'last':52},\n {'num':3, 'first':53, 'last':55},\n {'num':4, 'first':56, 'last':99},\n)\n\nfiles = glob.glob('bleach*.mp4')\nfor f in files:\n    num = int(re.findall(\"\\d+\", f)[0])  # find the first number in the filename\n    for season in SEASONS:\n        if num > season['last']: continue\n        new_file_name = \"BleachS%02dE%02d.mp4\" % (season['num'], num - season['first'] + 1)\n        print \"%s ==> %s\" % (f, new_file_name) # This is for testing\n        # os.rename(f, new_file_name) # Uncomment this when you're satisfied with the test runs\n        break\n\n\nA: There is a file manager called Thunar available in the repository which has a bulk rename option.  \nSee this site for more information:  http://thunar.xfce.org/pwiki/documentation/bulk_renamer\nYou can install thunar in the Software Center or on the command line with:\nsudo apt-get install thunar\n\nThere are other ways of doing this in bash, or by writing some code, but a graphical tool will probably get you what you want faster.\n\nA: I wrote you a python script\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport glob\nimport re\n\ndef rename():\n    episode_counts = (0, 20, 41, 63)\n    episode_pairs = []\n    for index, num in enumerate(episode_counts):\n        if index < len(episode_counts) - 1:\n            episode_pairs.append((num, episode_counts[index+1]))\n\n    episodes = glob.glob(os.path.join(sys.argv[1], '*'))\n\n    for episode in episodes:\n        match = re.search('.*(\\d{2}).*$', os.path.basename(episode))\n        episode_num = match.group(1)\n\n        for season, pair in enumerate(episode_pairs):\n            if int(episode_num) in range(pair[0]+1, pair[1]+1):\n                dirname = os.path.dirname(episode)\n                path = os.path.join(dirname, 'Bleach S{0}E{1}'.format(season+1, episode_num))\n                os.rename(episode, path)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    rename()\n\nI'm really new to python (which is partly why I wrote this, for practice), so it's probably not the best script in the world. But I tried it on a few test files and it seems to work.\nJust edit the line near the top episode_counts = ... to the last episode numbers for a season. I put in the first three from this page.\nSave the code as something like episode_renamer.py and use it with python episode_renamer.py /path/to/episodes/.\n\nA: To continue flogging this horse... if this is a one-time rename I would do something disposable like:\ncd /path/to/stuff\nls bleach*-lq.mp4 >x\npaste x x >y\nsed 's-^-mv -' <y >z\nvim z    # or use your favorite editor\n           # to rename the files manually\nbash -x z\nrm x y z\n\nIf you will be using it more than once, and for more than one kind of episode...  then python is the way to go, and the examples above are just fine.\n\nA: I'm developing a cross-platform desktop application that lets you rename a set of files from a specified pattern to another one.

After suspending and resuming, it appears to have reverted to the Unity notify-osd bubbles. This is annoying, because a bunch of notify-osd bubbles become little windows in the middle of the screen when the computer suspends. They also become queued up in the Gnome Shell notification bar at the bottom of the screen, all with the label \"notify-osd\".\n\nIf I log out and back in, notify-osd is gone and the Gnome 3 indicators are back until I put the machine to sleep. But how can I keep them permanently?\n\nA: notifications are sent via DBUS and after installing notify-osd it redirects all notifications to itself.\nThis would not be particulary troublesome if not so many packages would depend on notify-osd directly (ubuntu-desktop, blueman, guake, update-notifier, network-manager-gnome, rhythmbox to name a few), efffectively breaking the ability to choose the notification system I'd like.\nYou can remove the diversion with the following command:\nsudo dpkg-divert --remove --rename --package notify-osd --divert /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service.notify-osd /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service\n\nBut (I haven't tested this) this might either break updates of notify-osd (and thus your system) in a bad way or it might just reappear on the next update of notify-osd.\n\nA: This question (Oct. 2011) does not ask for the same information as this earlier one:\nIs it possible to replace notify-osd with Gnome 3 Indicators? (June 2011). This other question (June 2011) is more comprehensive than merely asking for a fix but rather asks how to control the environment, which may or may not also apply to this problem (Oct. 2011).\nConsequently, the following AU information is likely relevant to only the earlier (June 2011) question:\nUse notify-osd instead notification-daemon in GNOME-Shell \nThis provides information on how to create the situation that needs remedial attention for the original posted question above. It is not likely that this was how the above problem manifested so undoing and reversing the steps probably will not give resolution. However, it is relevant to the June 2011 post and directly addresses the issues requested there.\nThe system file (pangolin 12.04):  \nfile:///usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service  \n\ncontents are:\n\n    [D-BUS Service]\n    Name=org.freedesktop.Notifications\n    Exec=/bin/sh -c 'if\n         [ ! -x /usr/lib/notification-daemon/notification-daemon ] ||\n         [ \"$GDMSESSION\" = guest-restricted ] ||\n         [ \"$GDMSESSION\" = gnome-classic-guest-restricted ]\n         [ \"$GDMSESSION\" = default -a\n              \"$(basename `readlink /etc/alternatives/x-session-manager`)\" =\n                    gnome-session ] ||\n         [ \"$GDMSESSION\" = ubuntu ] ||\n         [ \"$GDMSESSION\" = ubuntu-2d ];\n      then exec /usr/lib/notify-osd/notify-osd;\n      else exec /usr/lib/notification-daemon/notification-daemon; fi'\n\npresumably, switching the code segments that are bold will do the switch, but whether the change is actually functional is another matter.

With SOOO many things different, it is hard to get used to coming from Gnome 2.x on my Elementary OS machines. But still loving how gorgeous everything is.\nI have been playing around with themes trying to get it looking a little better. I prefer dark themes cause they tend to be easier on the eyes. I followed the tutorials on OMG! Ubuntu about how to install shell themes.\nHow to install all the tools need to make Gnome 3 themable. \nAnd used the top 5 shell themes they featured here. \nOMG! Ubuntu's top 5 Gnome shell themes\nAnd for the System theme I followed the tutorial on how to install Adwaita Dark theme. This thing won't let me post more than 2 links, so if you need to see the tutorial or get the theme file, please search Adwaita Dark on omgubuntu dot co dot uk\nNow to the issue, for some reason the Adwaita Dark GTK part of the theme is not being applied to things like, Firefox 7.0.1, Thunderbird 7.0.1, Keepassx 0.4.3, Pidgin 2.10, and the Ubuntu One client GUI interface that came stock with Ubuntu 11.10. I would say that it is only the applications I've added after installing 11.10, but Gnome Tweak has the right Theme applied to it and Ubuntu One came stock. Could it be just that these apps having been updated to use the GTK version that Adwaita uses?\n\nA: GTK3 themes are only applied to GTK3 applications. For instance, in Ubuntu 11.10, Nautilus, Gedit, etc. use GTK3 but some applications don't use GTK3 yet (like Banshee, Pidgin, Firefox and lots more) so that theme is not used for those applications.\nThe best way around this is to use a theme that comes with both GTK2 and GTK3 versions (here are 4 such GTK2+GTK3 themes as an example). That way, both GTK2 and GTK3 applications look similar (well, not perfect, but very close depending on the theme you use).\n", "Q: What is meant by Easter Egg? I saw something named \"Easter Egg\" while searching. What is it exactly?\nHow to get them?\n\nA: Since you just said you found it while searching, I'll give a generalized definition. Easter eggs are generally hidden things in either games, websites, programs, or even inside the code of websites or anything. I've never known an easter egg to really gain you anything. Occasionally when playing a game and find an easter egg, you might get an achievement of some kind. But most true easter eggs are very deeply hidden and the reward is mainly from the satisfaction of finding it and being able to show your friends\nThe old style eggs were mainly a kind of inside jokes between the programmers of games, and people that first played the game and found them rarely knew what they were, but still thought they were funny. Lately most games either don't have easter eggs, or are relatively easy to find and either don't have any inside joke factor at all, or arn't that hard to get after thinking about it for a bit. They still try to be funny with them, but mainly are there for a neat thing for the gamer to find. Easter eggs on websites and in programming code (as far as I know) aren't nearly as prevalent.\n\nA: \nA virtual Easter egg is an intentional hidden message, in-joke or\n  feature in a work such as a computer program, web page, video game,\n  movie, book or crossword.\n\n(from Wikipedia)\n\nA: Easter Eggs in Ubuntu can come from GUI programs, Terminal programs and from any sort of code that a developer wanted to add for fun. The most famous/weird/funny one is the apt-get and aptitude commands.\nIf you do apt-get moo in the terminal you will see the easter egg.\nIf you do aptitude moo in the terminal you will see the beginning of a longggg easter egg chain of messages. To see the rest of the messages you need to add the Verbose parameter like this:\naptitude -v moo then each time a new message appears add another v like this:\naptitude -vv moo -> aptitude -vvv moo and so on.. until THE EASTER EGG appears.\nAnother one is VIM in the terminal. Type :help 42 and will remember a specific movie.\nGUI Tools that I have seen having an easter egg are VLC which showed me a cone with a Santa hat on December. When on December don't know.\nAnother GUI program is firefox. If you type in the url about:robots or about:mozilla you will see some easter eggs. The robot one is funny.\nEven unity has several which came from gnome. Press ALT+F2 and type one of the followings:\nabout:robots\ngegls from outer space\nIn general this are all created by the programmers just for fun. To add a special \"Am happy or bored so I made this\" feeling.\n\nA: An easter egg is a piece of usually humorous code hidden from casual users.\nMy favorite is:\nGo to the \"run application' dialog and type 'free the fish'\nWatch the fish.\n", "Q: How to install 100 server's less effort?

Also I know as mentioned in other places that glxgears can no be used as a benchmark tool, specially since it varies greatly depending on how big the gear window is and if it has another window on top of it.

Towards other network segments routing should be used.\nprotocol type is the routing protocol identifier of this route. proto kernel means:\n\nThe route was installed by the kernel during autoconfiguration.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*The man page that can be read by typing man ip in a terminal window.\n\n*Several topics on Serverfault. Especially this on scope.\n\n\nA: for proto kernel, it is a route added automatically when you assign an address to an interface which is not /32.\nLets say in your case, you assigned an address 111.211.3.193/26 to wlan0 (or some other in same subnet), kernel automatically adds route to whole subnet via this interface during auto-configuration. The only way to avoid this is assigning a /32 address to the interface.\n", "Q: Updating Chromium requires installation of untrusted packages I can't update my Ubuntu cause it says:\n\nRequires installation of untrusted packages\nThe action would require the installation of packages from not\n  authenticated sources.\nchromium-browser chromium-browser-l10n chromium-codecs-ffmpeg\n\nWhy is that? I never changed anything and it always used to work fine.\n\nA: If you haven't installed any PPA's for Chromium, press the Reload button in the package manager (the command line equivalent is sudo apt-get update). If the problem persists, wait a day before retrying. The mirror is possibly not completely updated yet or a proxy is caching the contents.\n\nA: Try:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chromium-daily/ppa\nThat should authenticate your chromium packages and let you download the updates, etc.\n", "Q: How to debug USB devices to write my own Drivers, such as we can debug network packets tcpdump -i any -x?

Thanks in advance!\n\nA: You need to provide the session properly. Unity is the default shell in Ubuntu, and since it cannot be used with RDP and similar, it will fail to start when you use the default Gnome Session. Therefore you need to add --session=ubuntu-2d to the session preferences. That will tell it to use Unity 2D instead of Unity. \n", "Q: Any package is not installing in my machine after downloading java. Give solution for my Problem I tried to install java.

Writing this answer, I realized I do not know anything about Orchestra. There's no link to any website or documentation on their Launchpad page.\nCan anyone familiar with it explain how it works and how to use it? I read Orchestra is going to be integrated into juju for easily setting up bare metal systems, so I'm assuming Orchestra works in a similar manner.\n\nA: Here is some basic information and a more detailed introduction by Dustin Kirkland.\nBasically, the Ubuntu orchestra server consist of the following components:\n\n\n*\n\n*Provisioning Server -> Cobbler\n\n*Monitoring Server -> Nagios\n\n*Management Server -> Juju\n\n*Logging Server -> Rsyslog\n\n\nCobbler is a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments.\nNagios monitors large deployments to ensure systems, applications, services and business processes are functioning properly.\nJuju was previously codenamed Ensemble. Through the use of charms, which describe services and their dependencies and interfaces, juju provides shareable, re-usable and repeatable expressions of DevOps best practices. Check out this Ubuntu Open Week Session for an intro to Juju.\nRsyslog is an enhanced syslogd supporting, among others, MySQL, PostgreSQL, failover log destinations, syslog/tcp, fine grain output format control, high precision timestamps, queued operations and the ability to filter on any message part.\nQuoting from the Ubuntu Wiki page about Orchestra:\n\nA collection of what we think are the best free software services for\n  provisioning, deploying, hosting, managing, and orchestrating\n  enterprise data center infrastructure services, by, with, and for the\n  Ubuntu Server. Orchestra, enables users to quickly deploy a solution\n  in the datacentre. Instead of manually setting up a complex network\n  installation environment, users can leverage Orchestra to rapidly\n  deploy new servers in production using the best open-source tools. The\n  process is standardised and fully automated, minimising manual\n  intervention and ensuring consistency.\n\nIf you scroll down on the above mentioned Ubuntu Wiki page, you will find two links for a tutorial on setting up an Ubuntu-based Orchestra server in the safe confines of Virtualbox.

A simple right margin fix is\necho 'stuff' | fmt -w 55 | lpr\n\nThis however does not add any margin to the left of the text. \nIs there a simple way to achieve this?\n\nA: There is also a -w option for fmt which sets the maximum width of a line and the -s option to split long lines. The default for -w is 75 characters. My quick solution would be something similar to this:\ncat [stuff] | fmt -sw 50 | awk '{printf \"   \"$0\"\\n\"}' | lpr\n\nHere fmt limits the characters per line (in this example 50) and divides long lines automatically. Then this output is piped to awk which adds as many spaces as there are between the first quotation marks after printf, then puts the line from fmt and eventually makes a line break by \"\\n\".\nI am sure that it can be done with awk solely, however I was so biased by your fmt that I kept it. I will add an EDIT as soon as I have an expression with awk\nonly.\n6chars\n", "Q: Why can I not keep instances of Firefox from two different machines separate anymore? Sorry this is a little long. It's one of those issues that's a little tricky to describe.\nI have two computers connected on a LAN. One is running Mythbuntu 11.10, and one is running Ubuntu 11.10 with (the awesome) Gnome Classic.\nBefore I upgraded to 11.10, I would often sit at Ubuntu machine and use SSH to access programs, such as Firefox, on the Mythbuntu machine. I could do this even if I already had a local instance of Firefox running.\nSo, just to be clear, before I upgraded I could run two separate instances of Firefox on one machine, each originating from a different machine. One local, and one over SSH from the other machine. One machine's Firefox has different bookmarks and settings than the other.\nNow, after upgrading, if I have the local instance of Firefox running, and I try to run another over SSH, I don't get the instance from the other machine. I get a new window of the already running instance.\nIf I want to run a program from the second machine, I have to first close any instances from the first machine that might be already running.\nThis is true regardless of which machine's copy I opened first.\nI don't know why this changed, but I suppose it doesn't matter. I'm just interested in results. How can I make it so that I can simultaneously run the two different machines' version of any one application at the same time? For example, two different Firefoxes originating from each machine?\n\nA: Found this on ubuntu forums. Seems to be a firefox specific thing... BTW, proposed solution is executing firefox with the -no-remote option to force it not looking for an already running instance.

Since upgrading from 11.04 to 11.10 (and therefore dovecot 1.x to 2.x) logwatch is reporting the end of every pop3 and imap session as \"unmatched.\"  I've been searching for a solution and found that logwatch-7.4.0 has at least one patch specifically for dovecot-2.x that is related to the pop3/imap log entries.  Is there a place where we mere users of Ubuntu can check the schedule to see when a package might make it to the repositories and/or request/suggest particular packages (such as the latest logwatch)?\nI could manually install the latest, but in the past I've found that once I go \"manual\" on a package, it is very difficult to get back on track with the repositories later. \nFWIW, I did replace the script for the dovecot service with the newer version and the report cleans up quite nice.  I'm sure other dovecot/logwatch users would appreciate getting logwatch-7.4.0 as much as I would.\n\nA: According to packages.ubuntu.com the next release of ubuntu(12.04) will have 7.4.0 in the repositories.

It can however, be incompatible with your current hardware, OS or other software. I would suggest you return this product, and purchase a comparable device that is compatible. (I'll post a link to the Ubuntu/Linux HAL here shortly.)\n You might also contact their company. I suggest you find their website for contact information. In your correspondence, you should include that you are a Linux user who would like to use their product, but you've had to return it due to the fact that they do not properly support a viable, and widely used Operating System. Also, that you will not purchase any further products until such matters are resolved.\nAside from that, @Javier Rivera make an excellent suggestion to visit http://ubuntuforums.org.\nI've been a member there for some time and I'm sure there is someone there that would be glad to continue a discussion on this topic.\n", "Q: Can I install the current version of Unity in an older version of Ubuntu? Is it possible to install current version of unity of 11.10 in 10.10 as I'm fed up with the power issues of current kernel version and would like to revert back. \nIf I revert back to previous kernel 2.6.38 on 11.10 can I solve the power issues and heating issues? And is it possible to install 2.6.38 on 11.10?\n\nA: \"Is it possible\"? Yes, it's Ubuntu and free software, so it's possible. But it is not practical. \nUbuntu started the transition from Gnome 2 to Gnome 3 with 11.04. Unity relies on some technologies from Gnome 3, like GObject. This could be fixed by replacing GObject from Gnome3 with GObject from Gnome 2, but that would require a little work. Unity also relies heavily on a very new version of Compiz. I know less about that, but I would assume that it is highly dependent on the X server. \nIn other words, you'd have to port many different things and it'd be a lot of work. 10.10 has less than 6 months left to live, so that's certainly not going to happen. If anything, it would be ported to 10.04, but that's highly unlikely. \n", "Q: reinstalling /var/lib/dpkg The hard drive on my server that contains /var crashed yesterday.

If it's lost, there's no way to 'rebuild' this database in a reasonable way. It keeps track of more than just what packages are installed, e.g. configuration choices (debconf). Recovering this from (earlier) backups may lead to other issues too - as the system state may have changed and the backup is invalid in such a case. This will result in conflicts later.\nOnly restore /var/lib/dpkg from backup if you know nothing has been changed concerning the package management in the meantime.\n", "Q: Can't decrease/increase brightness on Samsung NP300V3A more than 1 step I just installed Oneiric on a SAMSUNG NP300V3A (Series 3) laptop. Everything seems to work fine more or less except one thing:\nI can't reduce screen brightness more than 10% or so. Fn+F3 (brightness up) sets brightness to 100% and Fn+F2 (brightness down) sets it to about 90% or so. No matter how many more times I press it, it doesn't fall below that. For a video card I have an integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 chipset, but that's probably unrelated to the issue.\nWhat can I do to solve this?\n\nA: This question was solved by the OP:\nI have found a way to fix it!

What I did was put that script in ~/bin, make it executable, and then add it to Startup Applications.

You just select the software you want from a catalog and click Install to install it. \nYou can install directly from the web as well.

I expected to get a menu on startup to choose which version to start with. It booted straight into 10.10 and I didn't get the option of 11.10 at all. How can I get the menu at startup?\n\nA: Problem solved.  It appears I inadvertently overwrote the MBR in sda when installing the other OS ubuntu 11.10 alongside the existing ubuntu 10.10.  Warning if you are going to dual boot - when asked where to install bootloader put it in your ubuntu partition, NOT in the root of the hard disk otherwise you will overwrite the MBR.\nSolution:  Using \"Try Ubuntu\" from live CD or USB follow the instructions in this link\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair#A2nd_option_:_install_Boot-Repair_in_Ubuntu\ninstall the Boot Repair utility.

I have an ATI radeon mobile 3200/4330 dual GPU and the new compiz and even natty's compiz doesn't like my laptops card. I understand downgrading will loose unity 3d but I will still have 2d.\n\nA: In a nutshell: no. At least not without some issues. (I could be wrong).\nYou probably could purge all compiz packages and then try compile 0.8.6 from source, but I'm not certain it would work seamlessly.\n\nA: not certain I follow the question, but will try to assist you. Going to restate this as understood to determine if the actual problem is clear. Believe the issue is that when trying to run Unity, your current video card, and ATI Radeon Mobile 3200/4330 dual GPU is not playing well with Unity and therefore producing unsatisfactory visual results, is that correct? \nIf that is the case, then at the login prompt, you should see a gear by the password window. If you click on the gear, you can select from either Unity or Unity 2d at that time and then login. Subsequent logins should remember the last chosen session and retain your preference from the last session until you choose a different window manager (or choose to install another).\nThis can also allow you to get to a good known working state to resolve your issue with Unity and Compiz. Would highly recommend running the compiz check script found here:\nCompiz Check Script\nAs it can be valuable in determining if your card is capable with compiz (though it may be a bit dated).\nHTH\n", "Q: terminal emulators like Cathode?

You can uninstall it to shorten the response time.\n\nA: The shell does more than just looking in $PATH. If a command is not found, the bash function command_not_found_handle is executed which in its turn call the python script /usr/lib/command-not-found.

That details the procedure of adding another CPU to Linux guests.\n\nWith Linux guests, the following applies: To prevent ejection while\n  the CPU is still used it has to be ejected from within the guest\n  before. The Linux Guest Additions contain a service which receives\n  hot-remove events and ejects the CPU. Also, after a CPU is added to\n  the VM it is not automatically used by Linux. The Linux Guest\n  Additions service will take care of that if installed. If not a CPU\n  can be started with the following command:\n\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<id>/online\n\nOn the Known Limitations page, some drawbacks of the SMP capabilities of 32bit guests are listed. Mostly performance issues:\n\nPoor performance with 32-bit guests on certain Intel CPU models that\n  do not include virtual APIC hardware optimization support. This\n  affects mainly Windows and Solaris guests, but possibly also some\n  Linux kernel revisions. Partially solved in 3.0.12 for 32 bits Windows\n  NT, 2000, XP and 2003 guests. Requires 3.0.12 or higher Guest\n  Additions to be installed.\n\nIt does not say that multi processing is not possible.\n", "Q: How can I enable the power button on my server? The power button on my headless 11.10 server appears to do nothing unless I hold it in for 5 seconds or so, in which case it switches the machine off instantly.\nWhat I'd like it to do if I press it briefly is a normal shutdown (shutdown -P now). How can I allow this?\nI have seen this question but it is for desktop installations.\n\nA: You just need to install acpid package (sudo apt-get install acpid), its just one package, nothing more and it will handle all powerbutton events (acpi-support contains more additional packages). Tested on ubuntu server 11.10\nhttps://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2011-November/253766.html\n\nA: I believe you might need acpi-support.

When the user connects again, the process starts responding again.\nFor example the process is a database (H2) which stops responding queries when the user that started the process disconnects from the terminal, and starts responding again when the user logs in again.\nIs there any background process permissions that I'm not aware of that precludes the process from running in background?\nWhat could be causing this behaviour?\n\nA: nohup should work for you, what was your exact command?  Maybe you're missing something.  Here's section from wikipedia about it:\nNohupping backgrounded jobs is typically used to avoid terminating them when logging\noff from a remote SSH session. A different issue that often arises in this situation\nis that ssh is refusing to log off (\"hangs\"), since it refuses to lose any data\nfrom/to the background job(s).  This problem can also be overcome by redirecting all\nthree I/O streams:\n\nnohup ./myprogram > foo.out 2> foo.err < /dev/null &\n\nSo you could do something like:\nssh -n -f user@remotebox \"sh -c 'cd /foo/bar; nohup ./myprogram > foo.out 2> foo.err < /dev/null &'\"\n\nOr if that still doesn't work, you can try screen.  It will allow you to run your process in the \"background\", and it will keep running after you logout.\nFirst, ssh over to the remote box, then from there use screen and start your process, and you can give your screen a session name if you want.  You won't really notice anything different, but start your process in that session.  You can than exit out of the screen session by using the command Ctrl-a d.  It will look something like this:\nuser@remotebox:~$ screen -S foobarsession\nuser@remotebox:~$ startmyprocess\n[detached from 4865.foobarsession]\nuser@remotebox:~$\n\nYou can then exit out of your ssh session, and the process will keep running.  To reconnect to the screen session later on, ssh back to the remote box and use screen -r to reconnect.  You can use screen -ls to list the sessions.\nuser@remotebox:~$ screen -ls\nThere is a screen on:\n        4865.foobarsession     (10/05/2012 11:10:57 AM)     (Detached)\n1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-user\nuser@remotebox:~$ screen -r foobarsession\nuser@remotebox:~$ screen -ls\n        4865.foobarsession     (10/05/2012 11:10:57 AM)     (Attached)\n1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-user\nuser@remotebox:~$\n\n\nA: Processes started with nohup ... & are designed to run even after the terminal process exits. I don't think there is a core unix mechanism that suspends such processes. Although the scheduler might change its priority (because it might be considered as not-so-important process).\nI'm pretty sure, that the process continues to run, but something like a pipe is blocking it and prevents from responding.\n", "Q: Disable interactive SSH at user-level I connect to a server I don't control via SSH.\nI use public key access and don't need to be able to connect with a keyboard-interactive password.\nI would like to disable keyboard-interactive access to my user so that there is no way for others to hack in this way.\nSince I don't control the server, is there a way to set up my user's config file to prevent keyboard-interactive access?\n\nA: You just need to edit this line  from file /etc/ssh/sshd_config from yes to no:\n#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\n\nA: If you have absolutely no control over the server, I don't see a way of doing this, as you don't control server settings, which is where this would have to be.\nWhat you'd need to do is add this to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nNow, this would effectively disable password authentication for all users, which may be undesirable. What you could do then, is put this configuration directive in a Match block, so it only applies to your user, in the same config file:\nMatch user yourusername\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nIf you could get the server's admin to do this for you, it might be the way to go.\nOne other way is to set a really long, random and complicated password for your user, that way you're reasonably protected from random brute-force break-in attempts. Most attackers would likely be using some dictionary-based technique so as long as your password is long and random enough, it should be quite safe.\nSee \"man sshd_config\" for more details. Also, the solution I propose was suggested here.\n\nA: [I assume you're using BASH as your login shell.  If not, adjust appropriately...]\nIn ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, prepend a command specification to each line like this:\ncommand=\"ssh_key=XXX /bin/bash -l\" ssh-dss AAAA...K3E= me@mymachine\n\nIn ~/.bash-profile, put the following trap at the top:\nif [ \"${ssh_key}\" != \"XXX\" ]; then\n  echo \"${SSH_CLIENT}\" | mailx -s \"password login attempt!\" me@mailservice\n  exit\nfi\n\nNow you'll just get mail when someone uses a password to enter your account.\n", "Q: How  to make a input method for my conlang using m17n?

Help, please.\n\nA: First, look at the company's policy on VPN connections. What you're trying to do may be disallowed. If you have a VPN to the company, and use the internet to get subverted by a Black Hat, then the Black Hat has a VPN to the company with your identity. If you access the internet through the VPN and whatever else the company requires, if you get subverted, they bear some responsibility.\nTake a look at the route you have when connected and not connected to the VPN, with netstat -rn. Read man route. Be aware - when you fiddle with routes, you can end up with nowhere to send packets, if you're not careful. \n\nA: When you connect to a VPN, by default NM routes all traffic through the VPN. This means, if you try to access the internet it happens through your company's network. If your company does not allow this (or requires some special configuration), Internet access fails.\nIf you check \"Use this connection only for resources on its network\", I believe, NM tries to guess which network can be reached through the VPN and routes everything else to the internet as without the VPN. Now, it seems in your case, this guess is to conservative, giving you only access to a subset of your company's network.\nThere's no way to resolve this without knowing the topology of your company's network. \n", "Q: Music Purchased, but it was never put in my files on Ubuntu's server I purchased the following music on the following date (see cofirmation # below), and it was never added to my files for download.

I had to print a couple of PDFs recently to send to someone, but I wanted to redact (black out) a couple small bits of text.\nA quick google search didn't turn up any tools for this specific purpose, so I fell back to imagemagick & gimp:\n\n\n*\n\n*convert document.pdf document.png\n\n*gimp document-0.png\n\n*(use paintbrush to black out text)\n\n*print redacted page from gimp\n\n*print remaining pages from xpdf\n\n\nThe problem with this strategy is that the conversion process (from PDF to PNG or whatever other format) loses quality. I tried editing the PDF in gimp but it didn't work right away.\nIs there a specific tool that permits redaction in this way? (It doesn't even need to be \"real\" redaction -- I'm not sending a softcopy so \"fake\" redaction will work because the hardcopy can't be hacked to reveal the underlying text.)\nOr, is there a trick to being able to edit PDFs in gimp?\n\nA: I am redact a lot of PDF files everyday, so I spend a lot of time thinking how to do it the best way. \nFor me the best way is split PDF in 1-page PDF file, next to edit with GIMP, next to combine it. I don't use imagemagick on all files (I do not use at all), so I don't loss text-layer on all pages, but only on redacted. Do not load the whole PDF file at once, because it causes memory exhaustion.\nSplit PDF in 1-page files\nEasily split PDF files to 1-page PDF you can by this bash function (put it in ~/.bashrc):\nfunction pdf_split(){\n    for file in \"$@\"; do\n        if [ \"${file##*.}\" != \"pdf\" ]; then\n            echo \"Skip $file because it's not PDF file\";\n            continue\n        fi; \n        pages=$(pdfinfo \"$file\" | grep \"Pages\" | awk '{print $2}') \n        echo \"Detect $pages in $file\";\n        filename=\"${file%.*}\";\n        unset Outfile;\n        for i in $(seq 1 \"$pages\"); do\n            pdftk \"$file\" cat \"$i\" output \"$filename-$i.pdf\";\n            Outfile[$i]=\"$filename-$i.pdf\";\n        done;\n    done;\n};\n\nYou can now enter split_pdf file.pdf to get a lot of PDF files.\nRedact files\nBut, now you need edit all this files. \nYou can do it with gimp original-filename-*.pdf.\nI suggest configure shortcut in GIMP (Main window->Edit-> Shortcut) to replace file (I use CTRL+R), blur filter (eg. CTRL+D), close file (eg. CTRL+W) and exit GIMP (eg.CTRL+Q). Remember to don't load in GIMP to many files at once, but GIMP as you about load after open, so you can use gimp original-filename-*.pdf on thousand files safe.  \nCombine files\nYou can combine files easily with: pdftk originam-filename-*.pdf cat output \"new-file-anon.pdf\"; \nConnect it all together\nThese operations are very repetitive and boring, so I connect it all in 1 script:\nfunction pdf_redact(){\n    for file in \"$@\"; do\n        if [ \"${file##*.}\" != \"pdf\" ]; then\n            echo \"Skip $file because it's not PDF file\";\n            continue\n        fi; \n        pages=$(pdfinfo \"$file\" | grep \"Pages\" | awk '{print $2}') \n        echo \"Detect $pages in $file\";\n        filename=\"${file%.*}\";\n        unset Outfile;\n        for i in $(seq 1 \"$pages\"); do\n            pdftk \"$file\" cat \"$i\" output \"$filename-$i.pdf\";\n            Outfile[$i]=\"$filename-$i.pdf\";\n        done;\n        gimp \"${Outfile[@]}\";\n        pdftk \"${Outfile[@]}\" cat output \"$filename-anon.pdf\";\n        rm \"${Outfile[@]}\";\n\n    read -p \"Do you want open output file? \" -n 1 -r\n    echo    \n    if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]\n    then\n            evince \"$filename-anon.pdf\";\n    fi\n\n    read -p \"Do you want upload output file to Scribd.com? \" -n 1 -r\n    echo \n    if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]\n    then\n        scribd_up \"$filename-anon.pdf\";\n    fi\n    done;\n};\n\nThe newest version of this script is always accessible at: http://dostep.jawne.info.pl/it/bashrc\nRemember to close GIMP (CTRL+Q) after all redaction to continue script.\nIn addiction it as me to open redacted files (I like read to check whether all) and as to upload to Scribd with my other script - scribd_up, so now I can redact a lot of PDF files very efficiently.\n\nA: As a lot of solutions here recommend redacting / blacking out through annotations (which leave the original content in the pdf), I recommend rasterizing the pdf afterwards to truly remove the original content. (Don't be this guy.)\nHere's one way to do that which, at the same time, keeps the quality up and the file size low (at least in my case of a bunch of black/white pages):\n$  convert -quality 100 -density 180 -compress zip notreallyredacted.pdf trulyredacted.pdf\n\nNote: convert needs ImageMagick.\nNote 2: convert does not preserve the contents of forms you might have filled out. In order for it to not get lost you might want to print the document \"to a file\" in something like evince first (or in whatever application you filled out the form) and then rasterize it.\n\nA: You can use Okular.\nsudo apt-get install okular\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the pdf with Okular.\n\n*Press F6.\n\n*Press 8.\n\n*Highlight the text you wish to redact.\n\n*Right click the text, select properties, select the \"Type\" as \"Highlight\", press Ok.\n\n*Print the file to a pdf (check \"Force rasterization\" to make sure the redacted text is removed from the resulting file).\n\n\nA: (originally I recommened Okular but it didn't work as I expected)\n1. Edit the document in a vector editor\nI was able to open a PDF file in Inkscape, draw a rectangle over a piece of text and print it out. Inkscape is a vector editor so no rasterization involved. Some fonts looked wrong though - probably because the document was created on Windows machine with fonts which are absent on mine. \nNote that any method that does not involve rasterization is only acceptable if you're going to print the redacted document on paper and not distribute it electronically, as the text still can be retrieved from under blackouts.\n2. Increase the rasterization resolution when opening in a bitmap editor\nRegarding \"quality loss\" when opening the page in Gimp: you can directly open a PDF file in Gimp. It will be rasterized in the process. The amount of quality loss in the process is a matter of resolution you choose when importing - 300 dpi should give you a very decent quality (the default is 100). \nYou can also get good results with ImageMagick's convert command if you tell it to increase resolution:\nconvert -density 300x300 ...\n\n\nA: Open the PDF with the free tool PDF-Xchange PDF Viewer. Black out the text to be redacted using black rectangles. Print. That will get you easy, high-quality \"fake\" redaction.\n\nA: Use LibreOffice Draw for that quick editing that you are looking for. After you are done you can save it as LibreOffice Draw format or export it again to PDF format (File>Export as PDF)\n\nTo be able to import PDF files in to LibreOffice Draw you must first install the package libreoffice-pdfimport.\nInstall it via the Ubuntu Software Center (libreoffice-pdfimport ) or via a terminal with sudo apt-get install libreoffice-pdfimport.\n\nA: I remember one time me and a colleague had to find a way to edit a couple of pdf, We ended up using Gimp.\nI will comment you the details ... we open the pdf directly with gimp (in a terminal)\ngimp the_file.pdf\n\nOnce you are finished editing, we did not save the changes, instead of that we print in to pdf file ... That seemed to work ok.\n\nA: PDF Studio is a non-opensource and is software that requires purchasing.  \nIn terms of this question, from version 8 onwards it has a manual redaction feature. Users can select a text object and redact it. The content is removed from the PDF and replaced with a black rectangle. \nIn version 9 coming third quarter 2013, redaction annotations and burning will be also available for images and shapes.\n\nA: If you don't want to remember the correct incantation for convert you can use pdf-redact-tools, a shell script automating the process of exploding a PDF into PNG images and merging them back together after redaction (using a tool of your choice e.g. gimp). It's conventiently apt-get installable.\n\nA: Xournalpp is a popular variant of Xournal which has what you need. It is not available via the package manager (on Ubuntu 20.10), but a Github release can be built using CMake.\nThe build instructions here suggest the following dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install cmake libgtk-3-dev libpoppler-glib-dev portaudio19-dev libsndfile-dev libcppunit-dev dvipng texlive libxml2-dev liblua5.3-dev libzip-dev librsvg2-dev gettext lua-lgi\n\nIn Xournalpp you should then select the rectangle icon and, next to the pen colours, the paint bucket icon. You can then create filled rectangles - but they will be transparent. To make them fully opaque, select Tools > Pen Options > Fill Transparency and change the pop-up to 100%. (This is explained on the Github issue here.)\n\nA: Web Tools\nOkay, if your document is really sensitive, you don't want it going anywhere before redaction. Here are some web tools that may have good policy. The thing with these, is they have businesses aimed at corporate clients and offer these services to showcase their SDKs. Make sure to read their terms of service.\nNever leave the browser\nhttps://pdf.online/redact-pdf\nLeave the browser but they get deleted afterwards\nhttps://freepdfredactor.com/\nhttps://avepdf.com/redact-pdf\nOther suggestions\nIf you find better tools out there, feel free to comment. We'd like to have a good list of what's available to us.\n\nA: Basically what you are trying to do is highlight/annotate a PDF, but with some flexibility towards marker opacity and colour (you mentioned you don't need to censor/remove something, merely redact). Have you taken a look at answers here:\nHow can I highlight or annotate PDFs?\nOne of the highest rated answers recommends Xournal, which has not been mentioned here and would be my weapon of choice. It is a tool that allows you to make handwritten notes but has extra features allowing you to annotate a PDF. By default it'll save your annotations as a separate file but also allows you to export the annotated PDF as a new PDF. This should maintain the layout, fonts, etc.\nWith Xournal you'd choose \"Annotate PDF\", then use a solid black marker to mask the parts you want to redact, and \"Export to PDF\". \nThere are some stories on the internet suggesting that Xournal rasterises the text in the exported PDF (thanks for pointing this out, MHC). This does not seem to be true: with simple annotations, the text remains selectable and searchable and the file size does not increase by much (it increased from 205 kb to 220 kb in the example below).\nTo install, run in a terminal: sudo apt-get install xournal or just select it from the Software Centre\n\n\n\nA: You could also try this tool: https://launchpad.net/updf\nHere it is (but anyway, the text is selectable):\n\n\nA: The best way I have found to do this is to use http://www.pdfescape.com. You can annotate, add text and images, draw a \"whiteout\" rectangle around stuff you want to redact, and you can quickly download and save it. It also works really well with multi-page documents, which is something that lots of other solutions don't work well with. For example, if you open a multi-page document in Gimp or Inkscape, you will only be able to open one page at a time. The process is much faster in PDFescape. The whole process for me to redact a 2-page document takes less than a minute.\n\nA: There are multiple editors for editing PDF documents directly, such as pdfedit, or converter it to other vector formats that might be better supported, such as pstoedit. However I wouldn't recommend the use of any of them as the risk of doing something stupid, like just painting over the text with black while leaving the vectors in place is to easy, thus making the redaction trivial to undo.\nGoing the vector to bitmap route is the safest way, preferably the 1bit bitmap route, to avoid any potential issues with alpha channels or color differences that could leave the text readable.\nIf possible you should always redact the original document and just flat out remove the info, not the paint on the PDF, as even the kerning and spacing of text around the redacted text can give it away.\n\nA: I add to the list: Krita. Had no quality loss, because when importing PDF you can define dpi (set it to 300, as @Sergey said). After editing hit \"Export as PDF\". Lastly, I find Krita more intuitive than Gimp, after having been a long time user of Photoshop.\n\nA: If using LibreOffice to create PDF file, open doc in LibreOffice , highlight text to be redacted, right click and select character, select Background and click on black. Export to PDF.\n", "Q: KDE 4.7 - Plasma Netbook - Change the top panel to autohide Does anyone know how to set the top panel in Plasma Netbook not to autohide?\nI am aware this can easily be done with Plasma Desktop (by clicking the \"cashew\" and then \"more settings\").\nHowever it appears the same option is not available under Plasma Netbook.\n\nA: I wasn't able to find a way through the GUI to change this, but editing the ~/.kde4/share/config/plasma-netbookrc file and changing the panelAutoHide value to false, then logging out and back in worked for me.\n", "Q: What is button5? I want to record my Desktop and use zoom function. I changed Zoom in shortcut to <super>button5 and when I click Windows logo and scroll my mouse, it doesn't work. What I am doing wrong?\n\nA: XServer interprets scrollwheel as extra mouse buttons; in Compiz, it's Button4 for Wheel Up and Button5 for Wheel Down - more details in Compiz wiki. This is for Compiz in Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10 may differ (although I doubt it).\nI assume you have set up the shortcut using CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm).\nFirst make sure you have actually enabled the plugin you want to use for zooming.\nAlso, as lgarzo suggests, try setting a different, non-conflict shortcut, possibly without a Super key - this key is a bit overloaded in Unity and sometimes just doesn't work for custom shortcuts.\nEDIT: The problem was that Compiz wasn't actually running (see the comments below). Otherwise there's nothing wrong with Compiz zoom plugin.\n\nA: It's the mouse scroll up direction.\nTry Alt + Button5 instead.\n", "Q: Shutdown/Reboot (occasionally) freezes My computer would occasionally freeze when I shutdown or rebooted the computer for whatever reason.

I'm using the open source Motion CCTV/webcam software to allow me to view my camera live over a network. Internally, I can go to my web browser, type in the URL which is something like http://nameofmyubuntuserver:8081.\nThat will take me to my camera's live feed.\nNow I could port forward that to access it remotely, but there's the potential of someone seeing that address by something like analysing packets.\nIs there any way to secure that address? I'm running Motion on Ubuntu Server 11.04.\nPreferably I'd like to make it go through https as well as prompt for a password. I found this but it seems so complex. Is there an Ubuntu package which can allow me to access that address after authenticating myself and encrypting the connection? It doesn't even have to be Motion-specific. I'm just looking for an easier way to encrypt and authenticate a locally-hosted http site.\nOr even better, an Ubuntu package that creates me a new website with authentication and https (preferably something simple, Apache scares me), which then redirects to my local site in a secure manner?\n\nA: Is using ssh an option? In this case you can just tunnel the HTTP connection through your encrypted and authenticated SSH channel. Run at the remote client:\nssh user@yourUbuntuServer -L 10000:172.16.10.10:8081\n\nThen, point your browser at http://localhost:10000\nIt is also possible to set up a HTTPS server that acts as proxy for your HTTP service, e.g. with Apache. However, this will hardly be less scary than Apache.\n\nA: You need to set up Apache (or other webserver), configure SSL on it and make it to proxy your application running on :8081\nI don't know of a package which will do this for you. If Apache scares you you may try nginx or lighttpd, but there still will be some manual configuration.\nI also think you will get better answers on some other stackexchange site because technically it's not Ubuntu-specific. \n\nA: The following guides might be helpful in setting up your http server to use OpenSSL for encryption:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenSSL\nhttp://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/ssl-certificates\n", "Q: How can I find Application Indicator ID's?

Am not asking to download the DVD/CD or to upgrade from one version to the other until you get to 11.10. I want to know if an older can upgrade from 9.10 directly to 11.10 or something like this.\nAnd of course if yes or no, has this been thought about in any talks like a way to make it so that users have it easier to upgrade to the latest version in cases where it could not be done for a long time (Like moving around the world for 2 years with Ubuntu 9.10 and then coming home and looking at Unity in 11.10).\nINFO - I know this 2 already exist:\nHow to upgrade effortlessly from Ubuntu 10.04 to Ubuntu 11.10 on the same machine\nIs it possible to skip releases during an upgrade?\nIf the answer is still no, maybe more information about if any talks have been made to this kind of work or idea.\n\nA: As far as I know, upgrade only works from one version to the next, i.e. from 11.04 to 11.10 to 12.04. Also, it is possible to upgrade one LTS release to the next (10.04 to 12.04).\nI think there are good reasons why upgrading works this way - the upgrade procedure is developed and tested against a system in a particular state (i.e. fully upgraded 11.04) so migration scripts have some idea what to expect. \nIt may be very tricky have a generic migration procedure which can upgrade from some arbitrary machine state without going through each intermediate step. I'm finding that even upgrading from a not fully upgraded Ubuntu N to Ubuntu N+1 tends not to work.\n\nA: You should be able to upgrade from one version to the next but I would recommend backing up your files and doing a fresh install.

By doesn't work, I mean that when I boot into 3d, I only see a background image, no icons, panels, or anything else.  \nWhat are the most likely suspects for why this would be the case?  I would like to get 3d back to the way it was before I messed up my xorg (or whatever I messed up), and am looking for configuration files I could reset, or packages I could reinstall.\n\nA: I want to point out for the sake of other users that the answer is more likely resetting Unity, as @brunopereira81 mentions below.  So please, try that before tearing your hair out.\nHowever, in my case, the answer was a need to downgrade the version of xorg and xserver-xorg.  Once I did that, I had access to 3d again.  (The answer to this question shows more of the background of how I went from a working installation to a broken one, and half-way back again)  It ultimately stemmed from the xorg-edgers bug reported elsewhere.\nSpecifically, I had to reinstall xorg and xserver-xorg and ubuntu-desktop.  After following a lot of recommendations on resetting compiz, dpkg-conf, etc, I found a couple key items:\n\n\n*\n\n*For me at least, sudo apt-get remove xorg xserver-xorg ubuntu-desktop was insufficient, as this did not remove dependencies, even with autoclean and autoremove run after.\n\n*Rather, I had to use synaptic to do \"complete remove\" for each of these items.  \n\n*After complete removal, it finally also removed all the dependencies, and they were now the correct, rolled-back versions.\n\n*Reinstalling ubuntu-desktop adds them back.  There were about 5 items under xserver-xorg and xorg where it said it refused to install because another dependency was required.  The solution to this was just to write down the name of the thing it would install, and select that before selecting the refusing item, which then allowed itself to be selected.  It seemed strange to me this wasn't happening automatically, but there were only about 5 such cases, so it wasn't bad.\n\n\nThis series of operations fixed my 3d problems.  (However, I am still having issues with libglib2 that will likely require a similar set of tracking down removals and installations.)\n\nA: Compiz is the responsible for all the 3D nice effects in Unity.

When I shutdown my minecraft it never closes all the way, I have looked for a solution but found none. After awhile I gave up and decided that I would manually kill it when I wanted to close it.\nIf I use pgrep then kill in the terminal it seems to have no affect, but when I open the system monitor and right click and kill it, it shuts down nicely.\nWhat are the differences between the System Monitor way and the Terminal way? Does the System Monitor do something else in the background that the kill command does not?\n\nA: There is no difference between the kill command and the System Monitor's 'kill'. The System Monitor just gives some arguments to kill that I assume you don't know.\nWhen you kill <process-number>, it's actually sending a signal to that process to cleanly exit. This is called a SIGTERM. In order to kill a process unconditionally, potentially causing data loss, you need to send a different signal:\nkill -9 <process-number>\n\nThis sends a SIGKILL to the process, which immediately ends its execution. System Monitor uses kill -9 when you ask to 'kill' a process rather than simply 'close' it.\nThis answer on the SuperUser Stack Exchange should be of help.\n\nA: WHen killing an application using the terminal, I guess you ran:\nkill 1234\n\nOn the System Monitor, you selected the process and chose for sending KILL to the process.\nBy default, the signal that's sent to the process when using plain kill $pid is TERM. This allows applications to terminate gracefully. However, when sending KILL, the program is immediately gone without a chance to shut down cleanly (i.e. saving data). To send a KILL signal from the command line, use:\nkill -KILL 1234\n\n(the alternate way to run this command is kill -9 1234, this is just a matter of preference)\n\nA: That is because by default your pgrep kill sends a SIGTERM (terminate). If the application is not in a good state then a SIGTERM won't work. The \"Kill Process\" in System Monitor sends the SIGKILL command which will literally kill it. They are two different signals being sent. If you want to do it with pgrep you would use the kill -9, the -9 option sends the SIGKILL signal and will then be exactly the same as what System Monitor's \"Kill Process\" does. \nFYI, the name of the kill command is a bit misleading. man kill says:\n\nkill - send a signal to a process\n\nThis could be any signal. To see a list of all signals type man --sections=7 signal and scroll down.\nThen says:\n\nThe default signal for kill is TERM.\n\nSee https://askubuntu.com/a/716814/11929 for more info.\n", "Q: How to share my WiFi Internet via WiFi? I am connecting to a WiFi network through my laptop in Ubuntu. Now I need to share my Internet connection with my wife's netbook because her netbook is not able to connect to that WiFi network directly, because of its weak signal.\nHow can I do that in Ubuntu? \n\nA: Option 0: Solve this with hardware!\nI'll start with the alternative: Buy a wireless repeater. This is just a little box that repeats the wireless signal onto the main router. Sounds just what you're after because it means you won't have to be there for things to work.\nThey don't even cost that much.\nOption 1: Ad-Hoc networking\nBut failing that, you will need two wifi cards in your machine for this to work. You can buy an external one if (as I suspect) you only have one wireless card but this is why I suggested a repeater.\nAfter that, you can either use Ad-Hoc networking by using Network Manager to create a new wireless connection. Give it a name, set some security and tell it to share the network connection... And that's about it. Ad-Hoc isn't that robust and isn't supported by all devices (my Nokia N900 used to really hate it).\nOption 2: hostapd\nThen there's hostapd. This should expose the network card as a full access point provided it supports the hardware. If you have to buy hardware specifically for this, you should be able to get something that they support.\nIt's just a bit more fuss to get going.\nOption 3: another router\nIf your laptop also has a ethernet card, you could use Network Manager to share your connection over it and route that into the WAN port of another router. This might be viable if you have a router lying around and you don't mind your laptop being tied to it.\nJust edit the Auto eth0 connection so that under IPv4 Settings, the method is \"Shared to other computers\" and that should be about it. Similarly if both computers can be joined together, you could just use direct network cable with this setting.\n\nA: If you are lucky you can just get some new firmware to throw into an old router like DD-WRT, Tomatoe, Gargoyle or whatever else you think is good.

My problem is that I can't set a higher resolution than 1024x768 (4:3) in my external display. I can only set a lower resolution (800x600 and 4:3). I used it before with Ubuntu and I had no problem with the screen resolution so I think the problem is the VGA switch. Does anybody knows how to fix this problem? Does anybody knows how I can start? \nThis is a screenshot of my screen configuration. The green one is the HP display and the word you can read on it is \"unknown\". Yes, it's in spanish. Thank you very much.\n\nMore information:\nThe graphic adapter of my Dell Mini laptop is Intel945GSE UMA.\n\nA: The same occurs to me. You must add the resolution with:\nxrandr --newmode <ModeLine>\n\nTo know the ModeLine of your resolution, do this:\n$ cvt 1650 900\n\nYou will get some like this:\n# 1656x900 59.93 Hz (CVT) hsync: 55.98 kHz; pclk: 122.25 MHz\nModeline \"1656x900_60.00\"  122.25  1656 1752 1920 2184  900 903 913 934 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen, copy the information after the word “Modeline” into the XRandR command:\n$ xrandr --newmode \"1656x900_60.00\"  122.25  1656 1752 1920 2184  900 903 913 934 -hsync +vsync\n\nAfter the mode is entered, it needs to be added to the output:\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1656x900_60.00\n\nNow you have the new resolution :-)\n\nA: $ cvt 1366 768\n# 1368x768 59.88 Hz (CVT) hsync: 47.79 kHz; pclk: 85.25 MHz\nModeline \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\n\n\n$ xrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\n\nTo find id of monitors\n$ xrandr --listactivemonitors\n\nMonitors: 2\n 0: +*eDP-1 1366/345x768/194+0+0  eDP-1\n 1: +DP-1 1024/271x768/203+1366+0  DP-1\n\n\n$ xrandr --addmode DP-1 1368x768_60.00\n\n\nA: FelGutiCo and milkovsky are right, however I had to use the -r parameter to make it work (otherwise the left 20% of my monitor was blank and the image was fit into the right 80%), so what I did was:\n$ cvt -r 1920 1080\n# 1920x1080 59.93 Hz (CVT 2.07M9-R) hsync: 66.59 kHz; pclk: 138.50 MHz\nModeline \"1920x1080R\"  138.50  1920 1968 2000 2080  1080 1083 1088 1111 +hsync -vsync\n\n$ xrandr --newmode \"1920x1080R\"  138.50  1920 1968 2000 2080  1080 1083 1088 1111 +hsync -vsync\n\n$ xrandr --addmode VGA-1 1920x1080R\n\nPlus one hint, as I had to change \"VGA1\" to \"VGA-1\"; to find out the IDs of my monitors I used: \n$ xrandr --listactivemonitors\n\n\nA: you can do what FelGutiCo said. Furthermore if you have trouble after a restart (ubuntu cannot find the resolution) you need to create an .xprofile file in your home directory with the two xrandr commands from above:\n$ xrandr --newmode \"1656x900_60.00\"  122.25  1656 1752 1920 2184  900 903 913 934 -hsync +vsync\n$ xrandr --addmode VGA1 1656x900_60.00\n\nwhere 1656x900.. --> your desired resolution\n\nA: If you think the problem may be the VGA switch, why don't you try plugging the monitor in directly?\nAlso, there's a known problem with the video chipset on many netbooks, where the combined screensize cannot exceed 2048 pixels in any dimension. So if your laptop's is 1024 pixels wide, you can only add another display of up to 1024 pixels wide.\nTo check for this, open a terminal and use this command:\nlspci\n\nif you see \"Intel Corporation: N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller\" then your system is affected by this problem.\nThis is caused by some driver limitations in Ubuntu, here's the bug report for this:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/830949\nThis is why, if you try to set a higher resolution, you'll get a message saying that you need to fit all monitors within 2048x2048 pixels. Unfortunately there's no real solution to this but I can suggest two workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Arrange the monitors one on top of the other. Thus it's the vertical resolution that's limited, and 600+900=1500 which is lower than 2048, thus you'll be able to use both monitors.\n\n*Use Unity-2d, I think the limitation does not affect it.\n\n\nNote that if you try to set the resolutions via the commandline, you'll bypass the \"protection\" against setting an invalid resolution. This will not work and your system will become unusably slow. If this happens, just reboot it.\n\nA: The following command work for me on my Ubuntu 17.04 ,Lenovo Ideapad Z510 with Nvidia 1GB GPU \nubuntu@home-ideapad: xrandr --listmonitors\n\nA: This answer builds on the previous answers but differs from each in a certain way:\nTo introduce 2560x1440 QuadHD resolution and keep it after every restart on Ubuntu 20.04, I had to put the following in my ~/.profile file (as suggested here)\nxrandr --newmode \"2560x1440R\"  241.50  2560 2608 2640 2720  1440 1443 1448 1481 +hsync -vsync\n# the following device names are obtained with \"xrandr --listmonitors\"\nxrandr --addmode eDP-1 2560x1440R # optional for me\nxrandr --addmode DP-1 2560x1440R  # optional for me\nxrandr --addmode HDMI-1 2560x1440R\nxrandr --addmode HDMI-2 2560x1440R\n\nNote that the argument in the first line is obtained with\n$ cvt -r 2560 1440\n# 2560x1440 59.95 Hz (CVT 3.69M9-R) hsync: 88.79 kHz; pclk: 241.50 MHz\nModeline \"2560x1440R\"  241.50  2560 2608 2640 2720  1440 1443 1448 1481 +hsync -vsync\n\nas mentioned by @zsolt-katona in this answer.\nI tried without -r but it didn't work as expected.\n\nA: In addition to the answer of FelGutiCo, I would suggest the last step for anyone who has been getting :\n\nxrandr: cannot find output \"VGA1\"\n\nBecause you are targeting a different output device, you get that error.\nTo resolve this:\n\n*\n\n*query all available output devices, and check which one is connected other than your primary screen. Using the query option :\n\n\nxrandr -q\n\n\n\n*copy the connected device name, and place it instead of VGA1\n\n\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1656x900_60.00\n\n", "Q: Thunar as default file manager in Lubuntu 11.10 - how? PCmanFM misses the permission column in its detail view and the ability to set viewable columns. Because of this I switched to Thunar.\nNow I want to set it as my default file manger  in LXDE.\nHow to do this?\n\nA: The simple way...\nThe quickest way is to create a pcmanfm shell script in /usr/local/bin.  This shell script will instead execute thunar\nThus:\nnano ~/pcmanfm\n\ncopy and paste the following:\n#!/bin/sh\nthunar $* &\n\nSave\nchmod 755 ~/pcmanfm\nsudo mv ~/pcmanfm /usr/local/bin\n\nThe disadvantage though of this method is that you will lose any desktop shortcuts because on login, pcmanfm is no longer being run on login.\nLXDE/XFCE Hybrid\nA more interesting method would be to have the LXDE shell but with the XFCE desktop rather than the pcmanfm desktop\n\nThe reason for running with the xfdesktop is that it integrates with thunar whereas the pcmanfm desktop cannot be configured to launch folders stored on the desktop with thunar - only pcmanfm.\nThe recipe is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the default file-manager shortcut: edit the file /usr/share/applications/pcmanfm.desktop and change the line Exec=pcmanfm %U to Exec=thunar %U\n\n*Change shortcut keys: using leafpad change all references of pcmanfm to thunar in the file ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml\n\n*Stop pcmanfm desktop being run on login: edit the file /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart and change the line @pcmanfm --desktop --profile lubuntu to !@pcmanfm --desktop --profile lubuntu\n\n*Create a startup-on-login folder: create a folder called ~/.config/autostart\n\n*Start xfdesktop on login: create a file called xfdesktop.desktop in this autostart folder with...\n\n\nthe contents\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nExec=xfdesktop\nIcon=help-contents\nStartupNotify=false\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Utility;X-XFCE;X-Xfce-Toplevel;\nName=xfdesktop\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xfdesktop: sudo apt-get install xfdesktop4\n\n*reboot.\n\n\na third way...\nIf you don't want to run the xfdesktop - then follow the recipe above, but dont disable pcmanfm in /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart and you also dont need to autostart xfdesktop.\nObviously you are still left with the folder on desktop launching pcmanfm issue - but if you can live with this, this is a worthy compromise.\n\nA: For how to change and restore Default File Manager, check the link:\nUbuntu official documentation for Deafult File Manager\n", "Q: After upgrading to IOS 5 ipod is not detected by ubuntu 10.04 anymore I updated my iPod to iOS 5 and now Ubuntu 10.04 does not even mount it anymore, the version of libimobiledevice is 1.0.6-1, and I also tried the unpair/pair routine but it did not fix my problem, can anyone help?\n\nA: The reason why it doesn't show up under 10.04 is because with the iOS5 upgrade, Apple changed the way it talks to computers, and due to the fact that 10.04 is an LTS, it is highly unlikely that it'll get an update to \"fix\" it. \nHowever, it does mount under 11.10 - if using 11.10 is an option, that is the solution. \n", "Q: Photorec not seeing SD memory of camera I am trying to recover pictures form a friends SD memory camera. When I connect the camera and run photorec it is not seeing the camera as a drive for me to recover files from. It only shows my hard drive.\nIs there anyway I can force it to see my camera?\n\nA: I think you need to try mounting the card using something other then your camera - a card reader or maybe another camera.\nSome cameras use PTP so they're not mounted as a normal USB mass-storage device though it may look similar from Nautilus. Because of that, photorec has no direct access to the card's filsystem, so it can't recover anything.\n\nA: First make sure that the system is seeing the SD card of the camera. Photorec will only see what the system sees.\nIf Ubuntu does not see the SD card (which is weird in this times) then maybe trying to connect the SD with another device might help.\nAlso remember to have the SD already mounted before using photorec on it. Photorec does not automount devices ^^ (I wish it did actually).\nSo you got those pointers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Ubuntu see the device.\n\n*Make your the Device is mounted already and you have access to it via Nautilus for example.\n\n*Run photorec as root (which it tells you anyway but just in case) to have privilege for some operations photorec will do on the device.\n\n", "Q: Can I get Unity-style Super+[1-9] keyboard shortcuts for launching apps in Gnome Shell? I'm trying out Gnome Shell instead of Unity to see if I like it better, and the Unity feature that I miss most is the ability to switch to specific applications using Super+ any number from 1 to 9. Is there any way to add this feature to Gnome Shell? \nI could add custom shortcuts using the Gnome Shell System Settings, but those shortcuts would always launch new windows instead of switching to existing ones.\n\nA: Based on Mark Stosberg's \"Option 1\", using wmctrl, I've implemented a small script do this, launching apps using .desktop files. By launching .desktop files it also acts as a replacement for xdg-open, which is buggy in Oneiric (it opens .desktop files in a text editor instead of launching the appropriate application).\n~/bin/desktop-open:\n#!/bin/bash\nNAME=`grep '^Name=' $1 | sed 's/^Name=//' | sed 's/%.//'`\nEXEC=`grep '^Exec=' $1 | sed 's/^Exec=//' | sed 's/%.//'`\nwmctrl -xa $NAME || $EXEC &\n\nI've then used the GNOME keyboard settings to set-up custom keyboard short-cuts, where a short-cut's command is e.g. /home/richardt/bin/desktop-open /usr/share/applications/gvim.desktop.\nWhat I haven't managed to do is use a short-cut that comprises the Super key - GNOME seems to want to reserve this for switching to the Activities Overview, but perhaps that's a bug...\n\nA: Option 1: Gnome Shell extension: AppKeys\nThis extension emulates the Unity behavior in Gnome Shell:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/413/dash-hotkeys/\nDoes exactly what is expected and adds some more key bindings, like opening a new window for the application with Super+Shift+[1-9]. Confirmed working in Ubuntu 14.04.2 and Gnome Shell 3.10.4.\nOption 2: xbindkeys & wmctrl\nWhile It's not as user-friendly to setup and manage, you can get this kind of functionality in many environments, by using wmctrl and xbindkeys.\nXbindkeys can set to start at login. It will monitor a file called .xbindkeysrc, which can contain lines like this:\n#Launch or switch to E-mail\n\"wmctrl -xa Thunderbird || thunderbird\"\n    Alt + 2\n\n#Launch or switch to Konsole\n\"wmctrl -xa Konsole || konsole\"\n    Alt + 3\n\n#Launch or switch to IRC client\n\"wmctrl -xa Xchat || xchat\"\n    Alt + 4\n\nLike Unity, with this recipe you set up a key to switch to an application if it is running, or launch it if is not. I used Alt here, but you could use Mod4 instead, I think. \nOption 3: Use workspace-switching shortcuts\nSomething similar is to assign keyboard shortcuts that switch to specific desktops (or \"Workspace\"). If you run one application per workspace, then the shortcut effectively switches to that application. Look under Keyboard: Shortcuts: Navigation for the place to set the workspace-switching shortcuts. \nOption 4:  gnome-shell-extensions-windows-navigator\nAfter installing this Gnome extension, in overlay mode you can hold the ALT key and see a number assigned to each window. You can then press the number to switch the window. More here, including installation instructions. \n\nA: DockbarX includes the following option in its Preferences pane:\nUse Unity style number shortcuts (Super+number).\nIt is pretty much the sole reason I am using it currently in Linux Mint 14 (\"The DockbarX applet for MATE panel\" as listed by dpkg-query). In Linux Mint, I had to add the standalone \"DockX\" to Startup Applications.\nI have no experience with Unity so I was looking for a similar behaviour as the Windows 7 taskbar. One thing that Unity/Dockbar is missing compared to Windows 7 is that it won't minimize the window when it is already focused. It will only launch the app, or switch the focus to it. I found the minimize behaviour also very handy to quickly remove clutter and focus better on my current task. It looks like I might be able to emulate that by adapting the example scripts shared in the other answers here.\n", "Q: Need help to install Ubuntu on Win7 Alienware M17xR3, installing not working Please I need help to install linux on my computer to start analyzing Next Generation Sequencing (molecular genetics) for my work.\nI've tried to install from all different ways and forms and it gave me different errors.\nFirst I will describe my system:\nAlienware M17x R3\nRaid Drive 596GB (2x 298 GB)\nWindows7 primary partition C:\nThe hardrive is divided in 3 primary partitions (can't do 4 don't know why)\n1st: Fat16 no name capacity 40mbs almost not used (has files like command.com, dellbio.bin, dellrmk.bin and oobedone.flg) I dont know what this is for but is blocked and non system (Status:none).\n2nd: Recovery NTFS 9GB (Status:system) and it seems to have boot files.\n3rd: CD: Windos OS (status:boot).\nAnd I have 2 Logical drivers\nF: data for backup and games :D (300gb)\nG: For trying to install the Linux (Already tried with Fat32, Ext2, ext3 and ext4)\n\nInstalling with Wubi on F: and G:\nInstalation looks good on windows ask to restart\ndos mode appears:\n\ntry (HD0,0) non-ms:skip \n  try (HD0,1) NTFS5: No Wibildr \n  try (HD0,2) NTFS5: Error: \"Prefix\" is not set.\n\n\n\nInstalling with Wubi on C:\nInstallation looks good on windows ask to restart\ndos mode apears:\n\nMount denied becouse NTFS volume is already exclusive opened, the volume may be already mounted or another software may use it which could be identified for example by the help of the  'FUSER' command \n  Mount devdm-4\n  Could not find installation files /ubuntu/install custom-installation\n  Run 'Chkdsk /r' on windows and restart...blablablalba... that should correct.\n\ndone this didn't work.\nTried installing with USB drive and after burning a CD with the Iso file download from the official website:\nI've tried the option to install along windows with a G: drive in FAT32, EXT2,3 and 4, I've tried to leave unallocated data, without the driver G at all...\nappears this everytime:\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/eo2Ie.png \npres ok it ask me to:\n\nNot possible to install the boot loader at the location: specify new location:\n\nI've tried to select all the drivers non is accepted\nIf I ask to continue without installing the boot loader he ask me to install later by myself which I'm trying to figure it out but I'm not really good to understand how ppl get to the programming part like a DOS to write down couse I'm a newb and I've dont work on dos or linux before...\nI've read that the boot loader has to be installed on the primary partition, but I'm not sure what I can delete from those 2 partitions that would let me get 1 extra... and it seems that the one that windows use is protected to write down so the software is not touching it...\nPlease if someone have any idea to help me out...

(from glib 2.31 to 2.30?) EDIT: NEW FORMULATION OF THE QUESTION\nI have the wrong version of libglib2 installed.  I had some experimental repo that broke everything.  From this source,\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eog/+bug/880227\nI have learned that other people have addressed this bug by downgrading the libglib2 package.  However, I don't know how to do this.\nWhen I go to synaptic, and search for libglib2, I am met with many packages, rather than  just one to downgrade, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*libglib2.0-doc \n\n*libglib2.0-dev \n\n*libglib2.0-cil \n\n*libglib2.0-0\n\n*libglib2.0-bin \n\n*libglib2.0-data\n\n\nWhich of these gets downgraded for 2.30?  All of them?  Is one the master?\nSecondly, assuming I do choose libglib2.0-0, I face another problem: when I force version, synaptic warns me that the chosen action will affect other packages, and that 14 packages will be removed.  These include...\nTo be removed:\n\n\n*\n\n*gir1.2-totem-1.0\n\n*libatk1.0-dev\n\n*libcairo2-dev\n\n*libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev\n\n*libglib2.0-bin\n\n*libglib2.0-dev\n\n*libgtk-3-dev\n\n*libpango1.0-dev\n\n*libtotem0\n\n*totem\n\n*totem-mozilla\n\n*totem-pugins\n\n*ubuntu-desktop\n\n*unity\n\n\nI don't know what most of these are, but I'm fairly sure that ubuntu-desktop and unity are very important, and I don't want them removed.  How do I deal with this?  Is it safe to proceed in the downgrade even though ubuntu-desktop will be removed?  Will it safely and intelligently reinstall and update itself?\n\nA: In Synaptic, I elected to downgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*libglib2.0-doc\n\n*libglib2.0-dev\n\n*libglib2.0-cil\n\n*libglib2.0-0\n\n*libglib2.0-bin\n\n*libglib2.0-data\n\n\nIt told me it would automatically uninstall unity, totem, and ubuntu-desktop.  I clicked, \"OK.\"\nThen back at the package management screen, I selected ubuntu-desktop and unity for reinstallation.\nThen I applied the changes.\nThe moral of the story is that yes, these are important things that produce warning messages that it is scary to downgrade and reinstall, but it didn't seem to break.\n\nA: I guess you've installed glib from ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 repository.\nTo remove that repository and downgrade all the packages installed from there, run the following commands:\n# add it back so that ppa-purge can recognize it\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\n\n# ppa-purge will do the trick\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\nAlternatively, you can also use some graphical utilities like Y PPA Manager to do this.\n", "Q: How to make applications pinned in launcher appear for all users?

Can you guys help?\nAlso, if you have any other tips to make the install work better as a VM, please share them\n\nA: If you want something lightweight for VM usage, you may want to use Lubuntu. It basically is the LXDE/Openbox GUI environment but with the Ubuntu backend, so you can do all the stuff you'd normally do in Ubuntu, but without half of the resource sink.\nTo install Lubuntu into your Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nIf you want something a little more prettier, you may wish to try Xubuntu, although that even may a bit too \"heavy\" in terms of memory usage when compared to Lubuntu/LXDE. Also, it comes with a ton of extra packages to replace the default GNOME offerings, so if you want to replace things like image viewers, for example, then Xubuntu is the best offering one can get. If you just need to run scripts into a terminal and a few minor file management things, Lubuntu is the better offering.\nTo install Xubuntu into your Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nAnd of course, if you want to be even more lightweight, consider installing fluxbox or downloading a Fluxbox distro.\nTo install Fluxbox into your Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install fluxbox openbox\n\nRemember, Fluxbox does require a bit of setting up in order to use it. The menu is highly customizable, but by default doesn't come with all the options that the GNOME environment does. Again, if all you need to do is solely run the terminal for whatever commands, Fluxbox is a brilliant alternative.\n\nA: You might consider using a no-frills desktop environment, i.e., XFCE or something more minimal.\nAlso take note of the so-called \"JeOS\" distributions, delivered just enough Operating System for a virtual machine, e.g. Ubuntu JeOS (official site).\nEdit: Apparently, there's a also the \"Unity 2D\"-option but I can't find anything useful on this; not sure if its still supported by Ubuntu.\n\nA: On the logon screen, click the \"gear\" icon next to your name and choose a \"unity 2d\".\n", "Q: Downgrading from ubuntu 11.10 to 10.10, keeping installed programs I recently upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 then 11.10, and I'd like to revert back to 10.10.

This can save you an incredible amount of time, especially when this task must be repeated often. \nFirst, from a computer with all the applications preinstalled, retrieve your installed package list and redirect the output to a file called packages.txt.  Save this package list somewhere so that you can use it for the restore process.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > packages.txt\n\nTo restore all the applications from your list, you must follow a three step process very carefully.\nsudo dpkg --clear-selections\n\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < packages.txt\n\nsudo aptitude install\n\nYou will be prompted to install all the new applications in the list. Another example of what this process allows you to do is create a baseline of all the applications after a clean installation of Ubuntu.  Let’s say you would like to remove any applications installed since the clean install, perform the exact same process, and any package not defined in that list will be removed.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > clean-install-package-list.txt\n\nsudo dpkg --clear-selections\n\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < clean-install-package-list.txt\n\nsudo aptitude install\n\nThe very first command of “–clear-selections” marks all currently installed packages to the state “deinstall”.  When you restore the list of applications using “–set-selections”, only packages ommited from the list will remain in the “deinstall” state.  Aptitude will honor the deinstall state and remove the extra packages, leaving you only with packages from the list.\n", "Q: How can set up a file sharing server to allow remote access over a WAN?

If you prefer to stick with the repositories, you can also try the GADMIN tools (sudo apt-get install gadmin-samba) or perhaps the EBOX tools (sudo apt-get install ebox-samba).\nSamba is a pretty complex topic and perhaps others will post answers that can help, or search this site for more pertinents examples : https://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/samba\n\nA: I searched and found: https://owncloud.com/ \nThis is close to what I wanted to achieve. \n", "Q: Unable to Resume after Screen has Locked I am not able to resume a session after the screen has been locked for a long time.

Similar questions have been posted in the past, two of which are listed below.\nBlack Screen after Screen Lock\nScreens don't work after shutting off\nThis problem has also been reported to Ubuntu, who have provided the following wiki link for guidance.\nDebuggingKernelSuspendHibernateResume\nOne cause of the problem that is noted in DebuggingKernelSuspendHibernateResume is when the swap file is encrypted.  This will automatically happen if one decides to encrypt the /home directory during installation.  As I did not choose this option, I don't believe that my swap file is encrypted, however, I have encrypted the home directories of the Windows XP partition which resides on a separate drive.  Not sure if this is an issue but, how would I be able to determine whether or not the swap space partiion under Ubuntu has been encrypted?\nThe solution noted by @cprofitt in his/her answer to Screens don't work after shutting down mentions modifying xorg.conf, and possibly grub.  Unfortunately, I cannot locate the xorg.conf file on my system.  It is not in the typical locations that one would expect to find it (e.g. /etc/X11).  Also, I am not certain how to modify grub.\nAs a workaround, I have turned off screen locking, however, I would really like to solve this problem.

I know for a fact that this is not a problem since, I am still able to switch to my laptop when the problem occurs.  Furthermore, I have physically connected a keyboard and mouse to the PC where I have installed Ubuntu, and the problem still occurs.\n\nA: If you don't want to change screensavers (not sure why you wouldn't), there's another litle workaround.\nIt's a bit irritating, but I found that you can fanagle the screen lock by switching between terminals (ctrl-alt-F1, ctrl-alt-F7, ctrl-alt-F6, ctrl-alt-F7) until the correct login widgets finally show up.

seems to be the currently most recommendable wine-version for newer Blizzard games. Everything is running nicely.\nThis is on a normal PC though, without Ironhide of course. However, this might help to get the right wine versions to test.\n\nA: Unfortunately StarCraft II is currently unplayable with Wine (even on 1.3.31). It wouldn't change no matter how powerfull your computer was. You would still have to run it on the lowest graphic settings and the fps would be often dropping to 15 frames or even less.\nWineHQ AppDB page for StarCraft II you will find there test results for that game, tips and comments of other people.\n\nA: If you have 32-bit applications like Wine, and run 11.10 Oneiric or later, you will need extra libraries:\nsudo apt-get install virtualgl-libs:i386\n\nIs a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu?\n", "Q: What could cause network lag (after latest update) I got very different timings from script accessing gdata (Google servers) on Windows and Ubuntu on same machine and thought to compare ping google.com results:\n\nx-axis: packets\ny-axis: ms\n\n\nPing statistics for Windows 7:\n      Packets: Sent = 100, Received = 100, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\n  Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\n      Minimum = 54ms, Maximum = 107ms, Average = 57ms\n\n\n\n--- google.com ping statistics Ubuntu 11.04 ---\n  100 packets transmitted, 99 received, +4 duplicates, 1% packet loss, time 107550ms\n  rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 49.688/451.811/2436.608/532.491 ms, pipe 3\n\n\nWhat could couse this lag?\nI suspect that it's latest kernel update which was yesterday (2.6.38-12-generic), as I think everything was fine before last update, but I'm not sure\nAlso, please feel free to ask for data, as I'm relatively new Linux user, and Linux network is foreign to me\n\nedit 1: Here is output from iwconfig\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:\"home\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: 00:1F:9F:71:82:AF   \n          Bit Rate=48 Mb/s   Tx-Power=27 dBm   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n          Link Quality=39/100  Signal level=39/100  \n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:383  Invalid misc:93   Missed beacon:0\n\n\nA: \"Solution\" was trivial: I reset main router (to which I connect with USB adapter) and now everything is back to normal.\nGreat driver :?

I was using Ubuntu 10.4 and windows 7 until I decided to install only Ubuntu 11.10. Installation worked like a charm for me! Everything was ok until I installed additional drivers for Nvidia (I choose recommended)! \nThen the screen turns blank, computer is not responding to any command, but the processor still works. Now when I reboot manually, after I log in it passes around 40 seconds until screen turns blank again. \nI saw that people usually fix problems with this by \"rolling back\" drivers, but I need to know if this problem is fixed so I can use Ubuntu in 3D! I'm not a total beginner, but I would like help \"spelled out\" if you can! Thank you a lot!\n\nA: I had a similar problem some time ago.\nYou may want to rename /etc/X11/xorg.conf and reboot to let Ubuntu create a new xorg.conf file.\n", "Q: Ubuntu as the only office / commercial OS? I was wondering if any people had any experience of using ubuntu (and other office - like software & possibly some wine installs) as their only OS. To clarify, i am asking if anyone has experience with MS free office environments and would like their input on: \n\n\n*\n\n*Training time (not all office workers are tech savvy) \n\n*Migration Issues  \n\n*Support Issues  Compatibility with other MS using offices.\n\n*Other?\n\n\nI know in theory that Ubuntu has all the tools needed, but i havent heard of any experience of people actually doing it.\n\nA: There are some case studies of companies (or more usually goverment agencies) switching to GNU/Linux for workstations. Most notable would be Gendarmerie Nationale (French police) - they've switched to Ubuntu in 2009.\nIf you are looking for company-wide deployment, I'd recommend to contact Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) who can provide you all the information and support you need. There are more commercial-backed distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (by Red Hat) or SUSE (by Novell), and there are many local partners or independent Linux dedicated companies which will provide you with the support.\nEdit: I believe you should take first steps by using cross-platform software with your existing infrastructure - most software available for Ubuntu is available for Windows too. For example, switch from MS Office to LibreOffice (aka OpenOffice.org), and so on. This way you can apply training in small doses and always easily switch back if you run into any problems.\nIf you rely on some Windows-only software without any viable alternative, Wine could be a solution but it's definitely not a silver bullet - check out Wine's AppDB or try CrossOver (a commercial counterpart of Wine by CodeWeavers, which are contributors to Wine).\n\nA: We have used Ubuntu only with OOo (now LibreOffice) on all our computers since 2008, and on one computer since 2006. \nAnd we have used LibreOffice since it was called StarOffice, more than ten years ago. In all these years we have only come across ONE document (Excel) that was not readable in the free office program. (An early version of OpenOffice run on Windows XP.)\nOur website (http://valutronic.se) is 100% made with LibreOffice´s Writer/Web (WYSIWYG editor).\nAdding hardware like printers is a breeze -- Typically, while connected to the Internet, just connect the printer, turn it on and wait a few seconds. A sign pops up telling you the printer is connected and working.\nSoftware installation is best done via a Software center. If the program has dependencies (extra drivers needed) these are installed automatically. A child can do it, you don´t need any previous experience. No need for opening a terminal window any more.\nThe new desktop might look strange at first (I first hated it because it was so \"different from what you are used to\" -- a sign of starting dementia???)... \nbut when you get used to it and find out how intelligent it works, you will probably love it. I do now.\nWe still use Windows XP for an old TV card and our GPS map downloading software at home, but for all our business needs we use 100% Ubuntu. \nSo, my advice is: Install it on one computer, use it for a week and find out yourself. \nIn LibreOffice, you can save your work both natively in OpenDocument formats, or if you want to send them to others who use MS Office, in MS Office formats. \nInstall \"Ubuntu restricted extras\" and VLC media player and your Internet and multimedia experience will also be just fine. If you do advanced image retouching, try GIMP (some learning curve, however) and if you need to automatic colour correction for bad photos, try Pinta. Just install whatever you fancy from the Software center and try out the software. Almost all is free, so there is no reason not to.\nBest regards\nStefan Berge, Valutronic, Sweden\n\nA: We are using ubuntu and centos in our office (with two or three windows machines for for web designers).\nThis is my experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*Training time :- Nil. There is no need to be a tech savvy to use ubuntu.\n\n*Migration Issues  :- No issues.\n\n*Support Issues Compatibility with other MS using offices. :- No issues\n\n*Other? :- The only thing that I found is that coraldraw files are not working. There should be a software supporting cdr files . \n\n\nA: Google has been using a customized version of Ubuntu for many years. We used Google Docs, Sheets and Slides a lot, though, so didn't need LibreOffice really.\n\nA: I love it (being MS free).\noffice fully compatible. \nTraining is an issue but also issue with new msoffice 2007 + 2010.\nI won't go back to buggy, crashing, continual updates with MS junk.\n", "Q: Nautilus renames home folder Home, how to stop this? The Nautilus in Ubuntu 11.10 displays Home as the name of the user's home folder, the folder isn't really called Home, it's probably called /home/username.\nI want to see the REAL name in nautilus, how can I do this?\nI've tried Ubuntu-Tweak, Dconf, Gconf, and Gnome-Settings(advanced Settings), but no luck.\n\nA: Press Alt+F2 and type:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences always-use-location-entry true\n\nTo revert it type:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences always-use-location-entry false\n\n\nA: You're right, it does do that and does it consistently as an entity. I don't think that's configurable. But I do think it's quite appropriate, because that folder is actually called Home. For instance, if you're running commands in your terminal, then you'll refer to it as $HOME or even just ~, which is a shortcut to $HOME. \nThere is no rule that a users home directory is in /home. For instance, in a shared environment, then users might have their homes in /home/business_a/salesdepartment/username/. If such a user was to refer to his home directory, he'd still use $HOME. Or a more practical example is root. If you press alt+f2 and run nautilus, you'll run Nautilus as root. Home would then refer to /root, just as $HOME would refer to /root in a terminal. \nSo, when you're referring to your own home directory, its name is Home. However, if in Nautilus you press ctrl+L to see the location, then it's appropriately displayed as /home/username or wherever your home directory is located because then you're talking about the address of your home. \nIt would be interesting to know why you would want to change this. \n\nA: With the exception of the Desktop it simply shows the Name= from the .desktop of whatever app's .window is which currently in focus\nThe default .desktop for nautilus has a \"Name=Home Folder\". You can change that to whatever you want but it's only going to show whatever it is, not the current location in nautilus\n", "Q: GRUB doesn't give the option to boot into Ubuntu I  managed to download Ubuntu 11.10, burn an iso file on a cd and install it on a dell precision 380 along with windows xp. the problem is that ubuntu option does not appear when the computer is started. It seems my bootloader is not working properly. Any solutions?\n\nA: Here are two references you should look at \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling_GRUB2\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nComments converted to answer Anonymous Oct 28 '11 at 11:14\n\nA: Shahid, when you select the Boot from CD at you Setup and you restart you computer, the first screen that will appear for you is with the \"ISOLINUX...\" text.\nI think that you could verify this CD media in another machine and verify if your Setup is properly configured to boot up your CD driver.\n", "Q: Is there an e-mail client which does not need to download mail? I would like to know if there is a mail client that just \"reads\" and sends emails without having to download them on the hard drive, due to limited disk space. The advantage over using a web mail interface is that the mail functions centralised for all accounts.\n\nA: You can tell Thunderbird to use IMAP and not store attachments bigger than a given size and not keep too many emails on your computer.\n\nI guess you cannot download no emails since they have to be displayed somehow, but this will minimize memory usage.\n", "Q: How can i tell what went wrong on resume from hibernation?

Where are the logs i should be looking in?\nUPDATE:\nThanks Florian!\nI hesitated to read these pages before, as I am no kernel developer. But my problem turned out to be a case of encrypted swap  bug, which is described there. I do not have and encrypted swap anymore, but somehow resume thought I did.

How to diagnose what could be going wrong (which logs, etc)?

However, to confirm my hunches, what log file should I be looking at to even identify why this is happening?  I'm gunning with this question for a list of places that I should look to diagnose this crazy problem, given that there is a behavior that works differently depending on order of connection.\n(One other note, I know this has worked in the recent past, so it's not an issue of the wireless card itself.)\nUPDATE Mobile broadband has the same problem.  Does not work unless I first connect to wired connection and simultaneously connect to broadband before removing wired connection.  Help, please!\nUPDATE 2 Forget diagnosis, can someone fix this please?

Is there a way to quickly check the amount of free / used disk space in Ubuntu?\nI would assume you could right click on 'file system' in the file browser and choose 'properties' or something but there is no such option.\n\nA: Another way! Right click on computer in Nautilus (file explorer) and click properties. It displays how much free and used space is on your hard drive. \n\nA: Open System Monitor from Dash and select the Filesystems tab.\n\nOr alternatively open a Terminal and type:\ndf -h\n\n\nA: I wrote a little hack for this with a command line and gui version.  It's rather hard-coded, so may need some tweaks.  Also, the gui version appears to use a proportional font that messes up the alignment of the displayed output.

I have instructed DejaDup to keep one-week of backup files. Now it is passed more than a month and my backup storage is fed up with old backups. Is there a way to instruct DejaDup to delete old backups without reaching the storage limit? Can I detele them manually?\n\nA: You can use the Dconf app from Ubuntu Store to modify setting at path org.gnome.DejaDup, key name delete-after. It's set to the number of days to keep backup files on backup location.\nOr from terminal. For example, to set it to 60 days from the command line, run:\ngsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup delete-after 60\n\n\nA: The answer of https://askubuntu.com/a/94288/676490 for a local backup:\nduplicity remove-all-but-n-full 1 --force file:///home/username/deja-dup\n\n\nA: Deja-dup does not yet supply a way of removing old backups, you should also not delete some of the files, that will leave probably your backups without a start file and renders them invalid. Remove them all and start over is an option but thats not what you want I think.\nDeja-dup keeps backups for the specified time or until the backup space is full, it will them manage your backups accordingly, a solution for your problem might just be enable quotas for the backup drive and don't let it take all the space available or change the backup frequency, once a week if you edit many files or are always copying / moving files will leave you with a very large backup image.\n\nA: Additionally you can prune the backup yourself. What I did is to use:\nduplicity remove-all-but-n-full 1 --force scp://mylogin@myserver/path_to_backup\n\nfrom command line. Just use the information you used to create your backups from the Ubuntu GUI.\n", "Q: Unable to install boot loader I am able to run Ubuntu from a USB thumb drive, but EVERY time I try to install Ubuntu, all is well until I get the error grub-install/dev/sda    failed.\nIt gives me the option to continue without a boot loader; cancel the installation or install grub somewhere else.\nMy machine is a Dell XPS, with two 500G HD in a RAID 0 array.

Does anyone know if there's an easy way to find a list of packages installed, sorted by date, when using aptitude (or apt-get)?\nI installed a bunch of packages to try something new, but it didn't work out. I'd like to remove all of these packages, to get back some disk space. \nI've tried just looking at the list of .deb files downloaded, but that seems like a rather backwards way of doing it (although it did work).\n\nA: *\n\n*Use the dpkg logs\nlocate dpkg.log | xargs cat {} | grep \" install \"\n\n\n*OR if you don't have locate\nfind /var/log/ -name 'dpkg.log' | xargs cat {} | grep \" install \"\n\n\n*Use sort to ensure proper time based ordering \nlocate dpkg.log | xargs cat {} | grep \" install \" | sort\n\n\n*Use tac (reverse cat)*, head e.g to get latest 4 entries \nlocate dpkg.log | xargs cat {} | grep \" install \" | sort | tac | head -n4\n\ne.g For the last command, I get:\n2014-10-08 18:56:12 install xorg-server-source:all <none> 2:1.16.1-1\n2014-10-08 18:49:34 install libelementary-data:all <none> 0.7.0.55225-1\n2014-10-08 18:46:57 install e17:i386 <none> 0.17.6-1\n2014-10-08 18:46:56 install libedje-bin:i386 <none> 1.8.6-2.1+b1\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, dpkg (the package handler aptitude works on top of) does not specifically save the install date of packages, although there's thoughts of adding it. However, the install date can be found by looking at the date stamp of files written to the directory /var/lib/dpkg/info.\n\nA: You can also track down your previous actions by checking /var/log/apt/term.log, and older files term.log.1.gz etc.). It has timestamps and complete log from messages during install.\n\nA: By default, aptitude writes to a log file /var/log/aptitude.

To configure this (in /etc/apt/apt.conf or in a separate file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/), follow the Configuration file reference in aptitude manual (also available from \"Help > User's Manual\" in the menu):\nOption:Aptitude::Log\n\nDefault:/var/log/aptitude\n\nDescription: If this is set to a nonempty string, aptitude will log the package\ninstallations, removals, and upgrades that it performs. If the value of\nAptitude::Log begins with a pipe character (ie, ``|''), the remainder of its\nvalue is used as the name of a command into which the log will be piped: for\ninstance, |mail -s 'Aptitude install run' root will cause the log to be emailed\nto root. To log to multiple files or commands, you may set this option to a list\nof log targets.\n\n\nA: There is indeed an 'official'  pkginstall.sh script that can do this. Follow the instructions in the official documentation. Briefly, download the script from the above link, make sure it is executable and then run with:\n~/pkginstalls.sh\nThis will create pkginstalls.txt file in your home directory containing all the installed packages sorted by date.\nBTW, this is the content of the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n#pkginstalls.sh\n#creates text file with a list of all packages installed by date\n\n#first append all info from archived logs\n\ni=2\nmycount=$(ls -l /var/log/dpkg.log.*.gz | wc -l)\nnlogs=$(( $mycount + 1 ))\n\nwhile [ $i -le $nlogs ]\ndo\nif [ -e /var/log/dpkg.log.$i.gz ]; then\nzcat /var/log/dpkg.log.$i.gz | grep \"\\ install\\ \" >> $HOME/pkgtmp.txt\nfi\ni=$(( $i+1 ))\n\ndone\n\n#next append all info from unarchived logs\n\ni=1\nnulogs=$(ls -l /var/log/dpkg.log.* | wc -l)\nnulogs=$(( $nulogs - $nlogs + 1 ))\nwhile [ $i -le $nulogs ]\ndo\nif [ -e /var/log/dpkg.log.$i ]; then\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log.$i | grep \"\\ install\\ \" >> $HOME/pkgtmp.txt\nfi\ni=$(( $i+1 ))\n\ndone\n\n#next append current log\n\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep \"\\ install\\ \" >> $HOME/pkgtmp.txt\n\n#sort text file by date\n\nsort -n $HOME/pkgtmp.txt > $HOME/pkginstalls.txt\n\nrm $HOME/pkgtmp.txt\n\nexit 0\n\n\nA: There is a simple way to see all packages installation date.

So I would like to take high quality screenshots. Is there any tool for this?\n[The resolution of the image is the same as that of my screen, but surprisingly, it does not look as good as the original one.]\n\nA: The images are fine, but they look blurry because the default Gnome Image viewer is set to \"Best Fit\" instead of \"Normal view\", which resizes images slightly, making them appear blurry. Unfortunately, there seems to be no preference or setting that allows changing this. Instead just install another image viewing app, and make it the default:\nsudo aptitude install gthumb\nIt can be customized to view images 1:1 by going Edit -> Preferences  -> Viewer -> Set to actual size. Then go View -> unselect \"Thumbnail pane\" (with this on, it seems to interfere with 1:1 viewing). Test it, then if so make it the default app by going ubuntu \"System Settings\" (top right corner of your desktop) -> System info -> Default applications -> Photos -> gThumb.\n\nA: Shutter\nMy suggestion would be to use a screen capture tool such as Shutter.\nsudo apt-get install shutter\n\nIf you look in the preferences - you can define what the compression ratio is together with the graphical format.\n\n\nA: If you don't want to install yet another program give Gimp a try.\nFile->Acquire->Screen Shot...  \n\nA: How are you viewing the resulting image?\nThe default tool gnome-screenshot does take sharp images but if you open them in the default Image Viewer and knock the mouse scrollwheel (or the Best Fit option is in effect) then the quality degrades significantly.  In Image Viewer press Ctrl+0  (zero) to revert to Normal view (100% scale).\n\nA: Flameshot\nsudo apt install flameshot\n\nBe honest, compared with the most popular answer: Shutter, I would more like to use flameshot instead.\nBelow is the main reason;\nShutter is still heavier than Flameshot. Personally speaking, a screenshot is purely a screenshot, all I want is firstly selecting a range, freely adjusting it if I am not satisfied, adding some texts, or drawing important marks, then I can decide whether I want to copy it to clipboard or save it into file, that's it. I do not like extra pop-up a new window to let me do editions. I can do it using other type of tools.\nWhile for some people may like more tools or multi-tabs (Shutter GUI is combined with \"Tabs\" of each screenshot) to dig deeper or at one time, I would not like that, let it be simple and basic.\n\nA: It seems the built-in screenshot utility (by pressing Shift+PrtScr ) overly compresses the snapshot when its width goes beyond some extent or the H/W ratio is too high, causing the captured screen texts blurry. You can decrease the H/W ratio by including more area or reduce its width to see the difference.\n", "Q: Is there a way to create a Windows virtual machine on Ubuntu Server? When I look for documentation about how to create a Windows VM on an Ubuntu host, the only articles I can find are articles about Ubuntu Desktop, not Ubuntu Server.\nIs there a way to create a Windows VM on Ubuntu Server? Can anyone point me to any articles? Bonus points if I don't need to compile anything or do anything super complex.\n\nA: VirtualBox (what you'll have been reading about in the desktop threads) has a few command line tools that allow you to run any virtual machine in a headless state.\nAn example would be:\nVBoxHeadless -startvm vm_name\n\nYou would still need to set up the VM which can be done, I believe, with VBoxManage (VBoxManage --help for options there). It might be easiest to do initial configuration on a desktop and then transfer the config and disk image to the server.\nIf you want it to run on boot, you'd want to write an init or Upstart script for it to load, or just shove the command in /etc/rc.local as a lazy, unmanaged method (you'll probably want & on the end of the command so it doesn't block the system loading).\nBut similarly, you might have to use Upstart so it doesn't load up until networking has come up. Play around with it and let us know what works.\nBut you shouldn't need to compile anything.\nEdit: There are some run-on-boot suggestions in this thread.\nEdit 2: There are some old installation instructions here but what is really useful there are the example VBoxManage statements:\n\nVBoxManage createvm -name \"Ubuntu 8.04 Server\" -register\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"Ubuntu 8.04 Server\" -memory \"256MB\" -acpi on -boot1 dvd -nic1 nat\nVBoxManage createvdi -filename \"Ubuntu_8_04_Server.vdi\" -size 10000 -register\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"Ubuntu 8.04 Server\" -hda \"Ubuntu_8_04_Server.vdi\"\nVBoxManage registerimage dvd /home/ubuntu-8.04.1-server-i386.iso\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"Ubuntu 8.04 Server\" -dvd /home/ubuntu-8.04.1-server-i386.iso\n\n\nYou'll need to customise them for your situation but they should give you a good reference point.\n\nA: You should use KVM, because ... because Ubuntu love Kvm\nwhat is KVM \nKVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). \nUsing KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.\nThe kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux, as of 2.6.20. \nUbuntu uses KVM as the back-end virtualization for non-graphic servers and libvirt as its toolkit/API. Libvirt front ends for managing VMs include virt-manager (GUI).\nLet's go to hack\nThis setup guide is to configure a KVM on Ubuntu Server and management of the VMs is done remotely from another machine running Ubuntu Desktop.\nSERVER SIDE\nSTEP #1: Install lib-virt package.\nsudo apt-get install kvm libvirt-bin  \n\nSTEP #2:allow incoming tcp and udp packet on port 22 (ssh) on server\nsudo ufw allow 22\n\nDESKTOP SIDE\nSTEP #2: Install Virtual Machine Manager (on Ubuntu Desktop machine).\nsudo apt-get install virt-manager  \n\nSTEP #3: Connect to the server: execute virt-manager \ngksudo virt-manager\n\n\n\n*\n\n*FILE.\n\n*ADD Connection.\n\n*\n\n*Connect to remote computer\n\n*Method : SSH\n\n*User : your user server \n\n*machine name : ip address of the server\n\n\n\nNOW YOU ARE READY TO CREATE VIRTUAL MACHINE ON THE SERVER\nSTEP #4: Create the Guest VM image. Virtual Machine Manager provides a GUI to easily create an image. Just right-click on the server and select “New”. You will then be prompted step-by-step on the variables (e.g. # of processors, memory, etc.) needed to be configured for your VM.\nSTEP #5: Install the Guest VM OS.

Can anyone point me to a good tutorial on installing a root certificate on Ubuntu?\nI've been provided with a .crt file. I gather that need to create a directory at /usr/share/ca-certificates/newdomain.org and place the .crt  in that directory. Beyond that I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nA: Given a CA certificate file foo.crt, follow these steps to install it on Ubuntu:\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory for extra CA certificates in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates:\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra\n\n\n\n*Copy the CA .crt file to this directory:\nsudo cp foo.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra/foo.crt\n\n\n\n*Let Ubuntu add the .crt file's path relative to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates to /etc/ca-certificates.conf:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates\n\nTo do this non-interactively, run:\nsudo update-ca-certificates\n\nIn case of a .pem file on Ubuntu, it must first be converted to a .crt file:\nopenssl x509 -in foo.pem -inform PEM -out foo.crt\n\nOr a .cer file can be converted to a .crt file:\nopenssl x509 -inform DER -in foo.cer -out foo.crt\n\n\nA: Other answers didn't work for me with Ubuntu 18.04.\nAppend the certificate cert to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt using the following command:\ncat YOUR_CERT_HERE.crt >> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt \n\n\nA: Have the (root / CA) certificate available on a web server, local to your network if you like. \n\n\n*\n\n*Browse to it with Firefox.\n\n*Open the cert and tell Firefox to add it as an exception.\n\n*Firefox will ask you whether you want to trust this certificate for identifying websites, for e-mail users or for software publishers.\n\n*Enjoy!\n\n\nUpdate: It will be necessary to check if this works on Ubuntu 11. I've realised that I just did this on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: Given a CA certificate file 'foo.crt', follow these steps to install it on Ubuntu:\nFirst, copy your CA to dir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/\nsudo cp foo.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/foo.crt\n\nthen, update CA store\nsudo update-ca-certificates\n\nThat's all.

For example, Apache can provide HTTPS, Dovecot can provide IMAPS and POP3S, etc.\n\nA: To add a Root CA certificate in FireFox is now-a-days very easy. Just open preferences, go to \"Privacy & Security\", scroll down to \"Certificates\" and click \"View Certificates...\". Here you can click \"Import Certificate\".  Point to your root CA (.pem) and OK. That's all folks.\n\nA: Here are the simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install CA certificates to allow SSL-based applications to check for the authenticity of SSL connections:\nsudo apt-get install ca-certificates\n\n\n*Copy certificate file (crt or .cer) into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ folder, e.g.:\nsudo cp file.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/\n\nFor PEM file, see: Convert .pem to .crt and .key.\nOptionally, if using Charles proxy, this command can work:\ncurl -L chls.pro/ssl | sudo tee /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/charles.crt\n\n\n*Update certificates:\nsudo update-ca-certificates\n\nThe command will update /etc/ssl/certs directory to hold SSL certificates and generates ca-certificates.crt file (a concatenated single-file list of certificates).\nNote: Don't add certificates manually (as suggested here), as they are not persistent and going to be removed.\nNote: If you're running as root, you can drop the sudo from the above commands.\n", "Q: how do I get the nautilus navigation buttons and side panel back?

The name of the folder is not related to the user or home folder. It is related to a folder in /var/www. For example:\nIf user cyrex logs in ftp he is redirected to /var/www/gamers or at least shown a gamers folder inside his home folder that redirects to /var/gamers.\nIf user camelot logs in ftp he is redirected to /var/www/food or at least shown a food folder inside his home folder that redirects to /var/food.\n...\nThe thing he should not leave his home folder and can only access folders inside his home folder that are redirected to other parts like the /var/www/FOLDERS.\nUPDATE: In one way of configuration the user should see his home folder and also a folder that redirects him to /var/www/UserFolder. In another way of configuring VSFTPD the user should just be redirected to /var/www/UserFolder without even seeing his home folder, just the var/www specific to him. Can both methods be shown in one answer so I can test both to see which one is better.\nWhat is the easier way to do this.\n\nA: You just have to modify the startup call for vsftpd. The user_config_dir argument will tell the server to look for a configuration in the directory /etc/vsftpd_user_conf/luis if the user luis logs in. Analogously with any other user that logs in. I guess that if no configuration file is found the server will fallback to the default one. \nAnyway, take a quick read at this manual page (which you can access too from  the terminal with man vsftpd) : http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html\nThis other guide can help you with using custom directories for your server: http://gofedora.com/how-to-configure-secure-ftp-server-vsftpd/\n\nA: It is unclear from some sources whether it works with virtual users or normal (local) users as well. It works for local users too. \nIt was also unclear for me what I can set in the user-specific file. \nSo, here is what you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit the config file: sudo vim /etc/vsftpd.conf\n\n*add this line to it: user_config_dir=/etc/vsftpd/user_config_dir/\n\n*exit the editor with saving the changes (ESC and then :wq in case of vim, what we used above)\n\n*edit the user-specific file, for example, if the user is alice then sudo vim /etc/vsftpd/user_config_dir/alice \n\n*add the user-specific settings to the file, for example local_umask=0737\n\n*exit the editor with saving the changes (see above)\n\n*repeat the last three steps for each user for whom you want to specify any user-specific settings.\n\n*restart the ftp server: sudo service vsftpd restart\nNote: The above example enforces the user alice to create files with permission string ----r-----. This is useful if alice is your scanner who only uploads files to the server. The scanner never wants to read, change or execute the uploaded files but other users from the same group are allowed to read these files, like copying them for editing. These users still can delete the uploaded files if the permissions for the directory are set properly.\n", "Q: How do I connect to a VPN in GNOME-Shell?

You can say that CUPS is the one responsible for making almost all printers into a Out of the Box experience. No need for additional drivers, Printer CDs/DVDs or in most cases having to compile and do a lot of work to have it working instantly.\nThe following image is a GUI interface for cups. CUPS also has a web interface.\n\nThe other acronym that stands out as CUPS is HPLIP which is HP Linux Imaging and Printing. This one gives some enhancements over HP printers and all-in-one. If you are the 1% that has problems with detecting your HP printer with CUPS then try HPLIP. It covers that extra 1%. And it shows stuff like ink level and some other specific HP variables.\n\nHow to share a USB Printer with other computers\nTo SHARE A PRINTER in Ubuntu is really easy. Assuming you are using the default Ubuntu which comes with CUPS go to the Cog symbol in the top right part of the screen (Looks like a Gear). Click on it and select from the menu Printers (This is for 12.04 and below). If you are using 13.04 and Above you can click on System Settings since Printers will not be there. Then on the System Settings options click on Printers.\nYou can also open the Dash and type print, printer, printing, prin and so on (Any word that resembles printer) if you are using 12.04 and above. The printers icon will appear.\nOnce inside the Printers Window follow the steps below to share it in a network:\nStep 1\nGo to the Settings Option in the Server Menu in the Main Menu above:\n\nStep 2\nActivate the first 2 options so that the CUPS server knows that you will be sharing a printer in the network and looking for shared printers. This will solve two problems, one problem is when clicking on the sharing option inside the printer's configuration window will message an error saying \"Not Published. See Server Settings\". Since the server is not configured for sharing, this is the reason why it is not published in the network and even if you have it marked as shared, it will not appear on the network. The other problem it will also solve is the problem of other network connected PCs not finding the printer.\n\nStep 3\nRight click the printer in the Printer icon you wish you share and select SHARED. Also remember to ENABLE it in the same context menu. In my case I have it disabled. You can not share a printer if you have it disabled (Obviously ^^).\n\nStep 4\nGo inside the Settings for that Printer and in the Policies verify that Shared is enabled. If you did the Step 2 correctly, this option will not mention any sort of problem.\n\nSo there you have it. You have just shared your printer, have given it access for other network PCs and they can also add it to their PC as a shared printer and print on it. Nice!.\nHow to Share a Wireless Printer in Ubuntu in a LAN with Windows XP\nThe answer is mainly part of a detecting problem Windows XP has with shared printers (With Windows 7 and newer the problem is not there. But if it appears this is the same solution). The solution is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Wireless Printer you wish you share deselect the option SHARED. The CREATE CLASS option should appear in the context menu. Click on it.\n\n\n*On the Class creation window put the name as you want other computers to see the shared printer.\n\n\n\n*Select which printers will be available in this class (You can have several printers assigned to a class so when a printer in that class does not work the class can move the printing queue to another printer).\n\n\n*After the last step you should see the new \"Class Printer\" shared which makes reference to the original Wireless Printer. In the image below the printer EPSONL555 is actually the Class created. Click on this class and select SHARED. That is it. Your new class should be seen by all Windows XP clients.\n\nFor an added bonus you can configure Samba to make it so it shows all printer publicly. To do this, simply open up the terminal and type sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.cfg as seen in the image:\n\nThen go to the part that talks about printers (which are [printers] and [print$]) and change them to what the image shows, specially the part about browseable saying yes.\n\nAfter editing both sections save the file and close it. Then restart the samba service:\n sudo service samba restart\n\nYou should now have browseable shared printers for all Ubuntu and Windows computers on that lan network. This last part can also be seeing in Sharing Printer with CUPS\nNote that Wireless or USB printers work out of the box when shared to other Ubuntu computers. There are some cases where you will need to look for specific drivers. For the following makers you can look in the links provided:\nHP - Driver Package \nEPSON - Driver Search & Download (Remember to Download the correct .DEB packages)  \nOthers - Ubuntu Printer Section\nHow to connect to a Network Printer\nAssuming you are using the default Ubuntu which comes with CUPS go to the Cog symbol in the top right part of the screen (Looks like a Gear). Click on it and select System Settings. Then click on Printers. Now click on the Add button to add the printer. \nNote that since the printer is on the network (Not connected to you directly) the option for Network Printer will appear empty for a couple of seconds. The time depends on the network, how the router handles the queue and any other devices connected on the network. After a while the printer should appear under the Network Printer section and you will be able to select it. CUPS will take care of either installing the drivers if available or downloading one if not found on the system (Eg: Epson L555). In some cases for me it took 45 seconds, in others 5 seconds.\nIn this case, the computer that is sharing the printer should make sure that the printer configuration is correctly configured as mentioned above. If the Printer has wireless access, then make sure the printer is correctly connected to the router and that your PC is also correctly connected to the same wireless router. In the case you are connected via wired cable and the printer via wireless to the same router or same network, you need to also configure the router to make sure all wireless devices see wired ones.\nHow to configure the Printer section in Samba\nVerify you have the printer connected and samba/cups installed (The samba and cups packages should be installed, if not simply install them). This is because CUPS handles the printer while Samba handles the sharing but just in case you don't have them simply:\nsudo apt-get install cups samba\n\nAfter that we start with the configuration of them. If you are on either the desktop or server version of Ubuntu you can quickly configure it with this terminal way (The GUI way is explained above):\nEdit your samba main configuration which is located in /etc/samba/smb.conf. Type:\nsudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nWe want to change the following variables and remove the comment (# or ;) symbols in front of them if they have it. So for example:\nChange the WORKGROUP to the one the network is using, so other devices on the same workgroup will be able to see the printer:\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP_NAME\n\nIf you wish to allow guest to print then look for the ;GUEST = YES and remove the ; in front of it:\nguest = yes\n\nNow look for the security option and change it to share, this will save you several issues later on:\nsecurity = share\n\nNow we go directly to ther samba printer section which would look something like this:\n [printers]\n    comment = All Printers\n    browseable = no\n    path = /var/spool/samba\n    printable = yes\n;   guest ok = no\n;   read only = yes\n    create mask = 0700\n\nwhat we want to do is change browseable to yes and guest ok to yes\nShould look like this after editing:\n [printers]\n    comment = All Printers\n    browseable = yes\n    path = /var/spool/samba\n    printable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n;   read only = yes\n    create mask = 0700\n\nThis is all. Now restart the samba service. you can do it in several ways:\nsudo service smbd restart\n\nNow go to your windows system or Linux system and look for the printer in the network or the server IP. It might take some time because of how the network is configured and devices connected to it, but this should be the basic to configure any printer on the network.\nHow to add, configure and administer Printers with CUPS\nCUPS offers an excellent, web-based, configuration and administration system for all printers. If you have CUPS correctly installed, you can access this web system with the following link:\nhttp://localhost:631/\n\nWhich should show you the following site\n\n\nA: CUPS is an acronym for Common Unix Printing System.\nHere's a good blog post about it: http://www.debianadmin.com/setup-cups-common-unix-printing-system-server-and-client-in-debian.html\nfrom the post:\n\nThe Common UNIX Printing SystemTM, or CUPS, is the software you use to\n  print from applications like the web browser you are using to read\n  this page. It converts the page descriptions produced by your\n  application (put a paragraph here, draw a line there, and so forth)\n  into something your printer can understand and then sends the\n  information to the printer for printing.\n\n\nA: from a web browser go to \n        http://localhost:631/\nlog in with your username password and add the printer that way\n", "Q: Where is \"Applications > System Tools > File Types Editor\" in 10.10?

So I wonder how to do this equivalently in 10.10?\nOr do you have some better way to set up for opening .url files?\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: You can get the File Types Editor in currently supported releases of Ubuntu by installing the package called \"assogiate\".

Yeah, so I have 2 hard drives, on with 2 partitions(backups and windows), and I have another that also has 2 partitions with only one used. I have Ubuntu on hard drive 2:partition one, but I have come to a point when the /home folder can't hold any more files, but the partition is only about 15% filled up. So I did some researching and figured out that you can put it on a separate partition, but most of the guides were vague on what I needed to do.\nCould someone give me step-by-step instructions on what I need to do, or even tell me a, easier or different way to fix this /home folder capacity problem?\n\nA: Take a look at this answer: Change the default Downloads directory \nPosted here for your convenience:\n\nUbuntu Tweak can be useful for you this time, but includes the install of the Ubuntu Tweak software, whose intuitive GUI\n  will guide you on this and some other useful processes.\nWhen installed, simply choose Ubuntu Tweak from within the System\n  Tools sub-menu in the main menu. After which you can go to the\n  \"Personal\" section in the sidebar and look inside \"Default folders\",\n  where you can choose which will be your default folder for Downloads,\n  Documents, Desktop, etc.\n\nI hope this help you.\nGood luck!\n\nUnfortunately I haven't tested what you want to do but I have read that if you put the default home folder and other default folders in a different partitions, you will be in the need to auto-mount that partition in order not to experience a major issue at the boot.\nOnce I tried to do it with 2 different hard disk drives, which resulted in errors at the boot, solved by mounting the hard disk drive partition and closing the session and logging in again.\nI hope you find a better solution but this may give you a clue on where to begin. Please inform how did you manage this issue.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You normally use 2 partitions at least - better 3: One for the system, one for swap, and the third for home, on a single-user desktop system. \nIf you have plenty of RAM, you don't need swap, except for hibernation, which is a nice thing to have. You normally choose 1.5x your physical RAM-size for SWAP, if you don't have reason to do more or less. \nSo if you didn't use your second partition so far, I would use the opportunity to create a swap space, by splitting the free partition. \nA separate partition for home is useful if an major upgrade fails. You can install a new system without touching your home, keeping all data, all settings, all emails and so on in place. \nBut you have to investigate, why you can only use 15% of the current partition. \nFor creating the new partition, I would suggest\nsudo gparted\n\nto repartition the free partition.\nLater you format the one partition, which shall be the new /home with \nmkfs.ext4 \n\nfor an ext4-filesystem. You copy your home-folder content over, preserving attributes and permissions - the easiest way is to use the midnight commander - to preserve date/time as well, so that your files don't get the time/date of copying. \nThen you mount testwise the new partition as /home. This will hide your old /home which makes it a bit tricky to delete it later, but you don't want to delete it, before it works. \nFor deleting the old content, you unmount /home, then you rename /home to /home-old, and create an empty /home folder for remounting the new partition. Then you can safely delete /home-old. \n", "Q: Gnome-shell, how to fix it? \nPossible Duplicate:\nAti incompatible with Gnome-shell? \n\nmy gnome-shell display screen  is tilted/ skewed, how do I fix it? sometimes the screen flashes, how do I fix it?

However, I now receive the following errors related to package 'qt-mt':\n$ make ARCH=arm xconfig\nPackage qt-mt was not found in the pkg-config search path.\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `qt-mt.pc'\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\nNo package 'qt-mt' found\nPackage qt-mt was not found in the pkg-config search path.\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `qt-mt.pc'\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\nNo package 'qt-mt' found\nPackage qt-mt was not found in the pkg-config search path.\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `qt-mt.pc'\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\nNo package 'qt-mt' found\nPackage qt-mt was not found in the pkg-config search path.\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `qt-mt.pc'\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\nNo package 'qt-mt' found\nHOSTCXX scripts/kconfig/qconf.o\nscripts/kconfig/qconf.cc:6:21: fatal error: qglobal.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\nmake[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/qconf.o] Error 1\nmake: *** [xconfig] Error 2\n\nThe xconfig is being run on the host Ubuntu desktop to prepare the kernel options for a cross-compiled kernel image.  Since the xconfig is run on the host, it is not being built with the cross-compiler.  I have no clue what is happening here, but I think it might be related to where the qt libraries are installed on Ubuntu.\nI've found the following thread on the Fedora forum, but I don't know if it applies to my situation on Ubuntu.\nhttp://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=139653\nI've also tried to uninstall and reinstall QT3 and QT4 using the apt tools, but the error given above still persists.  Any suggestions on what I could do to successfully compile xconfig?\n\nA: This question was answered by the OP\n\nWith more experimentation, a\nmake distclean\n\nseemed to fix the problem. I can now build the kernel xconfig successfully.\n\n", "Q: How do I use a DV Camcorder as a Webcam?

A horizontal scroll would be good for this also but for the moment the removal of the wrapping is what I need.\n\nA: It depends on what application you are using.\nIf you are viewing a file or command output using less, passing the -S option (a.k.a. --chop-long-lines) will cause output to be chopped off rather than wrapping to a new line.  You can use the horizontal arrow keys to view the rest of the line.\nFor generic non full screen applications, you can turn off line wrapping by sending an appropriate escape sequence to the terminal:\ntput rmam\n\nThis mode can be cancelled with a similar escape:\ntput smam\n\nDetails on adjusting the behaviour for a few other command line tools can be found here:\nhttp://tomayko.com/writings/StupidShellTricks\n\nA: To disable line wrapping in terminal more generally, you can use:\nsetterm -linewrap off\n\nA: Leaving aside the wrapping thing, you can zoom out/ zoom in in terminal to see all the content you need in one line.\nFor me is :\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Shift++ - to zoom in\n\n*`Ctrl+- - to zoom out\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How to show line numbering in nano when opening a file Is there a way to tell nano to automatically show line numbering each time I open a file?\n\nA: It's 2021. The OP's question is still valid, but many of the answers here are for an older version of nano. I'm not presenting this answer as \"the last word\" - only as an update.\n\nThe default screen of nano consists of five areas.

Line numbers in the edit window are positioned in the left margin. It is possible to display the line number in either or both the edit window and the status bar.\nDisplay line numbers in the edit window:\nThere are several methods (this is not necessarily a complete list):\n\n*\n\n*Before the file is opened:\nEdit/create the file ~/.nanorc with the following line:\nset linenumbers\n\n\n\n*When the file is opened:\nUse the -l option in nano:\n$ nano -l <myfilename>\n\n\n\n*After the file is opened:\nToggle line numbers \"on\" and \"off\" w/ alt-shift-#:\naltshift#\nDisplay line numbers in the status bar\n\n*\n\n*Before the file is opened:\nEdit/create the file ~/.nanorc with the following line:\nset constantshow\n\n\n\n*When the file is opened:\nUse the -c option in nano:\n$ nano -c <myfilename>\n\n\n\n*After the file is opened:\nToggle line number display in the status bar \"on\" and \"off\" w/ alt-shift-C:\naltshiftC\nSummary\nThese all work as of today: Ubuntu 20.04, nano --version = GNU nano, version 4.8, although there are minor discrepancies in the documentation.\n\nA: If you have already opened the file with nano you press \nCtrl+w+t\n\n(not simultaneusly, press control and w, then without letting go control and letting go w, press t)\nThis command will require column and line, you enter them this way:\n10,23 (enter)\n\nand you will end up in line 10 character 23.\nIf you are at the top of the file and you only want to find the line:\nCtrl+w+t and then 10\n\nIf you are at a acertain line and you want to find the column:\nCtrl+w+t and then ,23\n\nIf you haven't opened the file yet, you can do this:\nnano +10,23 file (enter)\n\nand the file will open with cursor in the line 10, chanracter 23, so you can try also:\nnano +10 file (enter)\n\nnano +,23 file (enter) (Note that this will send you to the character 23 of the first line only)\n\nA: The keyboard combination to display the current line number whilst you are using nano is CTRL+C.\nAlternatively, to display the line & column number position you could just use the -c parameter when launching nano i.e:\nnano -c [filename]\n\nTo make this permanent, nano uses a configuration in your home folder ~/.nanorc\nThus to display line numbers always when using nano...\nnano ~/.nanorc\n\n(don't worry if its empty - this file doesn't exist by default)\ntype set constantshow\nN.B. the deprecated syntax set const is shown in the animation\nSave\n\n\n\nSince you are using line numbers remember you can use ALT+G to jump to a specific line number.\n\nA: Compile Nano from source:  \ngit clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/nano.git;cd nano;./autogen.sh;./configure;sudo make install \n\nThen add the following to your .nanorc file:  \nset linenumbers\n\nYou can use Meta+# to turn line numbers on and off from within Nano.\n\nA: If nano -c filename does not work, use nano filename then Ctrl +_. It will ask you for the line number to go to.\n\nA: Accidentally found nice shortcut: Alt+#, which in some keyboard layouts can be done with Alt+Shift+3. \n\n\nA: According to the man page for GNU nano 2.9.3 (also verified on version 4.8) , you have two options for automatically opening with line-numbers shown and one for toggling them on/off once nano is open:\nCommand Line Flags\nYou can use the -l or --linenumbers flags.\n       -l, --linenumbers\n              Display line numbers to the left of the text area.\n\ne.g.\nnano -l foo.txt\nnano --linenumbers foo.txt\nVia the config file(s)\nAlternatively, according to the man page for nanorc, you can add set linenumbers in ~/.nanorc, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nano/nanorc or ~/.config/nano/nanorc.\nINITIALIZATION FILE\n       nano will read two configuration files: first the system's  nanorc  (if\n       it exists), and then the user's nanorc (if it exists), either ~/.nanorc\n       or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nano/nanorc or ~/.config/nano/nanorc, whichever  is\n       encountered  first.  See nanorc(5) for more information on the possible\n       contents of those files.\n\n       set linenumbers\n          Display line numbers to the left of the text area.\n\nSo the contents of my ~/.nanorc file are simply:\n 1 set linenumbers\n 2\n\nVia a key bindings\nNot exactly what the OP was asking for, but for completeness you can also toggle line number on/off via the default keybinding (as of v4.8) of Alt+N.\nAlternatively you can rebind this key via the man file mentioned method:\nREBINDING KEYS\n       Key bindings can be changed via the following three commands:\n\n          bind key function menu\n                 Rebinds the given key to the given function in the given menu (or in all menus where the function exists when all is used).\n\nThe format of key should be one of:\n\n          ^X     where X is a Latin letter, or one of several ASCII characters (@, ], \\, ^, _), or the word \"Space\".  Example: ^C.\n\n          M-X    where X is any ASCII character except [, or the word \"Space\".  Example: M-8.\n\n          Sh-M-X where X is a Latin letter.  Example: Sh-M-U.  By default, each Meta+letter keystroke does the same as the corresponding Shift+Meta+letter.  But when any Shift+Meta bind is made, that  will\n                 no longer be the case, for all letters.\n\n          FN     where N is a numeric value from 1 to 24.  Example: F10.  (Often, F13 to F24 can be typed as F1 to F12 with Shift.)\n\n          Ins or Del.\n\n       Rebinding ^M (Enter) or ^I (Tab) is probably not a good idea.  On some terminals it's not possible to rebind ^H (unless --raw is used) because its keycode is identical to that of the Backspace key.\n\n       Valid function names to be bound are:\n\n...\n\nlinenumbers\n            Toggles the display of line numbers in front of the text.\n\nRegarding alternate config files:\nIn response to comments about alternate config files, from the description of man nanorc:\nDuring startup, nano  will  first\n       read  the system-wide settings, from /etc/nanorc (the exact path might be different on your\n       system), and then the user-specific settings,  either  from  ~/.nanorc  or  from  $XDG_CON‐\n       FIG_HOME/nano/nanorc or from ~/.config/nano/nanorc, whichever is encountered first.\n\nI would not typically advise others to change the system-wide config file, unless you have a good reason to do so, as it will likely be overwritten during any updates, and is not likely to be included in system backups, which typically only include the home directory.\nUsing with sudo\nAs noted by a commenter, this may not work as expected if you have to use sudo with nano, e.g. sudo nano myFile. This is because when you use sudo you are doing whatever comes after sudo as the \"super user\", thus the name (super user do ..). If you edited your non-super user config file (e.g. ~/.nanorc or /home/myUserName/.nanorc) this will not be run when you use sudo as you are not running nano as myUserName any longer. Thus, you have a few options.\n\n*\n\n*The simplest is just to use the -l flag and it will work as is.\n\n*Copy the contents of your ~/.nanorc to /root/.nanorc as this represents the home directory for the super user. Assuming you have your ./nanorc file setup as you like, and you don't already have a /root/.nanorc file then you can just run sudo cp /home/myUserName/.nanorc /root/. Note this will overwrite any existing nanorc file in /root and you must replace myUserName with your actual user name. I didn't test, but I'd guess you can't use the tilde operator, i.e ``sudo cp ~/.nanorc /root/as it would likely interperet this to be/root` rather than your username as again, you're telling it \"super user do cp from home directory\".\n\n", "Q: Canon MP630 M/F printer wont print correctly In Ubuntu 11.10, the MP630 seems to install correctly but when printing, it prints double height characters with blank lines through them, on a very simple text(e.g.  in gedit).

I bought a new hard drive and installed Windows followed by Ubuntu 11.04 on it.  In the screenshot below, Windows System, C:, swap are Primary partitions.  I then put / and /home in an extended partition.  I left about 150GB, which is highlighted, because I wanted to make it a D: later.  \nWindows will not let me format that volume, since I have already have 4 partitions.\nUbuntu Disk Utility is not recognizing it and I cannot create a partition from that allocated space either.  \nIs it possible to take that unallocated space, and put it under the \"Extended partition\" without extending any existing partitions?  My aim is to have a partition formatted in NTFS/FAT32 that both Ubuntu and Windows can use.\nI will reformat and reinstall if required but would like to know if there is a quicker way first.\n\n\nA: You can resize the expended partition so it occupies all the space which is currently unallocated and then create an NTFS partition inside the extended partition. Since only the end of the extended partition need to be moved, the existing partitions inside it can be kept and also the operation will be quite fast.\nI second the suggestion of brunopereira81 to use gparted for that.\n\nA: Use gparted for that (install it with sudo apt-get install gparted or look for gparted at the USC).\nSelect the unallocated disk space, right click on it and select New\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu One only downloads filenames I have installed Ubuntu One on two Android devices and two different laptops (running 10.x and now 11.1).

On Lucid one could create a URL by right clicking the desktop anywhere and a menu would appear that allowed the creation of a launchpad location (a URL) and once created when clicked it would launch the desired web location.  How is this accomplished in Oneiric Ocelot?\n\nA: The old GUI dialog is still available if you still want to use this:\nUsing ALT+F2 type\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop\n\nThis will launch the old GUI Dialog and you can create a shortcut on your Desktop:\n\nPrerequisites\ngnome-desktop-item-edit is installed automatically if you have installed gnome-shell/gnome-fallback.  It is also installed automatically if you have previously installed gnome-tweak-tool.\nAlternatively, you can install the old gnome-panel without much of the bulk:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\n\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I create launchers on my desktop?\n\nA: As I won't remember the command the next time, weeks ahead, I created an icon in the desktop for creating launchers (\"direct access\" in Windows parlance).\nSomehow it replaces the missing contextual menu option.  \nThe file name is ~/Desktop/makeLauncher.desktop`\nThe file content is:  \n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon[en_US]=gnome-panel-launcher\nName[en_US]=make launcher\nExec=/home/<your user>/bin/createLauncher  <== replace here\nComment[en_US]=GUI for creating launchers\nName=make launcher\nComment=GUI for creating launchers\nIcon=gnome-panel-launcher\n\nThe executable is another small file named: /home/<your user>/bin/createLauncher\n#! /bin/sh\n\ngnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\n\nDon't forget to chmod this last file to make it executable.\nThis displays an icon with a foot-print. Double-clicking it opens the launcher creation dialog. \n\nA: You can open the URL in Firefox and then drag and drop the handle at the left side of the location bar to the desktop. Here's a video (attention: loud music): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6RHvH4R2fM\nTo drag and drop, you move the mouse pointer to the handle (at the left side of the location bar, as seen in the video), then click and hold the first mouse button (the one where your index finger is) and move the mouse pointer to your desktop while still holding the same mouse button. Once the pointer has reached a place on your desktop where neither Firefox nor any other program is visible, you can release the mouse button, i.e. lift your index finger a bit. During that whole operation, do not press any key on your keyboard.\nIt works in Oneiric with Unity-2D, Natty with Unity-3D, and probably everywhere else, too.\n\nA: i tried the assorted drag and drop suggestions.  it seemed to work on some web sites but i discovered that i didn't have a link, i had a copy of the web page.  on other sites i would have an icon but it wouldn't work until i had gone thru two dropdowns and selected firefox from a list.\n  the gnome create trick above works with some modification.  you don't change the type to location, leave it as application.  it will have a command box where you type        \"firefox web site name\" (substitute the url of the web page you want complete with the http and : and //). \nfor info i'm running 12.04 ( i don't remember the cutsey name).\nemmett\n", "Q: How to bind custom commands to keyboard shortcuts?

Method to avoid entering password? Unfortunately, my web hosting plan does not allow public key authentication. Apparently, this method is available to VPS and dedicated server customers only.\nI've backed up my Ubuntu 11.10 machine using Deja-Dup and I'm sending the backed up files to my web host using rsync.\nI would like to automate this process using a script, but as I am not able to use public key authentication, I am forced to manually copy and paste my (strong) SSH password each time to start the process.\nIs there a way round this? If so, how?\n\nA: If you need to enter your password, you'll have to do it through expect, because ssh insists on passwords coming from a terminal. Here's an example expect script.\nIt's possible that the host has disabled public key authentication, but that would require that they deliberately turn it off (with PubkeyAuthentication No in /etc/sshd/sshd_config). There's no technical reason why they'd do it, it would be purely for market segmentation.\nI recommend that you first try to make public key authentication work. Follow this procedure to generate and upload a key. Don't hesitate to ask here if something doesn't work; if you tell us what you tried and what error messages you got, we might be able to propose a workaround. If you run into problems, post the sshd configuration (/etc/sshd/sshd_config if the web host is running Ubuntu, maybe another location like /etc/sshd_config if the host is running some other distribution), and the output of ls -ld ~ ~/.ssh; ls -l ~/.ssh.\n", "Q: How to make your College to use Ubuntu? Well I have been using Ubuntu for past one year. Even though I'm not yet experienced with all the commands that Ubuntu provides, I like Ubuntu. In my college they use Windows. In such a situation how do I explain my teachers/HOD/Principal that Ubuntu is as powerful as Windows? I know I have said this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Its a open source.\n\n*No virus.. All softwares can be installed easily\n\n*We can use Wine to run .exe applications.\nApart from these what all strong points can be given to change my college to Windows to Ubuntu?\n\nA: I guess it really depends on what faculty you are in. If you are studying computer science and they are using windows, you better just quit that college and go somewhere else!\nBut seriously, in general you can say these:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is free! FREEEEEE I tells ya! (this should generally be good enough! Unless you are living in a country that doesn't respect copy-right law)\n\n*For this next point, you should be ready: It can do whatever you can do in Windows as good, if not better.\n\n\n*\n\n*Documents, Spread sheets and Slides\n\n*Internet Usage\n\n*Programming Environment\n\n*Scientific programs: This is in fact where you should know the programs and it's easier or harder to convince the faculty[1].\n\n\nWhy do I say this is important? Because they have found luxury in doing their work in Windows. If you don't offer them something that can do all they are used to, they just won't accept it.\n\n*And of course like you said, no viruses.\n\n\nAnd you can do these things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find people good with Linux who volunteer to be Linux admins. This is important because as soon as you get people to work with Linux, you are gonna get a lot of questions about how it works or how to fix it (Do I hear you saying Ubuntu is so easy to use, you can just install and work with it like Windows? Unfortunately not yet. The load of questions in this website shows the opposite).\n\n*Suggest first to have both operating systems so they always feel they have the safety of booting in their Windows when they are fed up with Linux.\n\n*You should then start showing them stuff that exists only in Linux to make them use it often. Things such as a program that does your work easier/faster or an extra tool to create documents etc.\n\n*After a few years that everybody is used to and comfortable with Ubuntu, you can go about telling them to remove Windows and keep only Ubuntu.\n\n\nSomethings to remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*Teachers and principals are older people. Older people don't like change, so don't try to go too fast.\n\n*Teachers and principals are older people. Older people are behind technology, so don't overwhelm them with options.\n\n*Teachers and principals are older people. Older people don't like to spend time searching, so just install a working set of programs (better if they have a familiar feel, so similar to Windows ones) and tell them (and show them how to) work with those. If they get used to it, you can introduce new ones.\n\n*Teachers and principals are older people. Older people get frustrated easily, so make sure you, or any admin, is instantly there as soon as they have problem. Even if they don't ask you, it wouldn't be bad to check up on them to see if everything is fine.\n\n*Teachers and principals are older people. Older people, especially men, don't like a student telling them what to do, so try to be very diplomatic. Try to teach them, or tell them what to do, in a manner that they don't feel stupid.\n\n\n[1] I don't know the softwares much, but imagine a field for which there are a lot of great software under windows, but nothing serious under Linux. In such a case, you probably should first extensively test those software with wine to make sure it actually works (wine is not that perfect yet). Many engineering programs could be quite problematic like SolidWorks or ComSol.\n\nA: Shahbaz has really hit the mark with the going slow and diplomatic route.\nAt my University the biggest problem seem to be switching from MS office to Libreoffice or OpenOffice. If you have not worked on LibreOffice I would recommend that you first become knowledgeable using it so that you can show those people that you want to convince that it really is a good office suite. Just note LibreOffice 3.4.3 has a problem with handling footnotes so I will wait another week for the arrival of version 3.4.4 which has fixed this problem. Also, Ms Office 2010 supports the odt file format so that significantly increases the compatibility between MS Office and LibreOffice.\nAlso, LibreOffice does not have a integrated grammer checker but you can install an add-on called LanguageTool. The pagination add-on is also very useful if you want to insert page numbers.\nProbably the biggest problem, will the IT \"experts\" at your College be able to administer Linux? Thats also a huge problem because if something goes wrong, then someone should be able to fix it. \nLastly, I have found that by first introducing open source programs to people and leaving them to use it for a while makes them more willing to switch to Linux. I have used LibreOffice to convert people to switch to Linux. The biggest hurdle to linux adoption is the users that seem to be afraid using anything other than windows.\n\nA: From my point of veiw, I use Ubuntu (generally Linux) for those reasons:\nPackages support \n\n\n*\n\n*The system is shipped with all applications, ready to use 2 minutes after installation\n\n*Everyone can easily install applications via software center or command line\n\n*If you need, you can choose the version of application you need. Additionally, you can install not-released-yet version from custom PPAs.\n\n\nOpensource & Community\n\n\n*\n\n*Whole system (and most of the applications) are free of charge\n\n*The system is reviewed by many people so many bugs are found and fixed\n\n*If you are in troubles, there are many ways to ask and receive fast answers from community (for example this site)\n\n\nSecurity & Safety\n\n\n*\n\n*Most of the viruses are designed for Microsoft OS so they won't affect your system\n\n*Thanks to clean system design it's difficult to create really dangerous virus for Linux\n\n*There is easy user management and setting up user rights so you are sure your mother won't break the computer by launching the wrong app.\n\n\nProgramming platform\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu (and Linux generally) has outstanding support for programming tools\n\n*You can use almost all IDEs on Ubuntu, simple text editors or terminal editors (vi, emacs)\n\n*There is support for all programming languages\n\n*It's easy to run and test your programs via console\n\n*It's easy to install, configure and use all kinds of servers (apache, database servers, web servers)\n\n\nTerminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Besides the programming itself, you can use terminal to connect to remote servers (ssh, scp, ...) without installing additional software\n\n*Use the power of shell commands and regular expressions when working with your files, processing data or maintaining the system\n\n*If you need to fix/configure something, it's often only about copying several lines from the guide or mail-from-guru and you get the issue fixed.\n\n*You can extend the system functionality with your own scripts launched whenever you need.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n*\n\n*You have the same environment on your servers and on your PC: You can use tools you are used to use when managing the server. You can redirect X server and launch window applications remotely. You can have the exactly same versions of programs on both server and your PC.\n\n*Somebody says Ubuntu GUI is much easier and comfortable than Windows.\n\n\nPossibility of choose\n\n\n*\n\n*In almost all cases, you can choose from several variants of the application. Unlike Mac OS, you aren't forced to use the \"best\" app and only it.\n\n\nAnd after all, it's Linux. You got to love it :)\n\nA: You simply can't. Colleges change very, very, slowly, and the processes, committees, diverse interests involved in every decision make it very hard for any small group of people to accomplish change, even in the faculty or administration.\nAnd while Ubuntu is free, change is costly. How many hours do you think it will take to install Ubuntu on all of the machines? How much time to train IT staff that could do everything they needed to do on Windows but are unfamiliar with linux? How much time with the administration spend in dealing with complaints from students, staff, faculty, and parents who don't understand the motivation for this change?\nOh, and what if some part of a mission-critical management Windows application has a bug that only shows up when run in Wine. How much money would be lost then? That probably won't happen, but how sure would you need to be before authorizing the change?\nThe problem with the question is that you are thinking as an individual, and change is cheap for individuals. For large orgainizations ... well, there is a reason that my employer still uses Windows XP here in November of 2011.\nAddendum: Please keep in mind that as far as we know, here in 2011, there are no colleges on earth that have made the switch to Ubuntu. It isn't necessary that we conclude that it isn't feasible (though I have, for other reasons) but the other answers here either haven't been tried, or have been tried and failed.\n", "Q: No such file or directory for existing executable I just upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10 x64 from Ubuntu 11.04 32bit.

Have a look at a thread over at the ubuntuforum where eranga1988 had a similar problem.\nFurther down in that thread CoBrA2168 seems to give a solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*download both SIP and PyQt4 from the official website\n\n*install qmake, python3.1-dev, gcc-c++ (for the g++ command), and the libqt4-dev.\n\n*then the compilation worked along the following lines \n\npython3.1 configure.py\nmake\nsudo make install\n  \n*note that some had to provide qmake's location to the call to python above: \n\n\npython configure.py -q /usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake\n\nwhere they got the path to qmake from locate qmake\nYou might have to tune this to your version of Python 3.

Got a new laptop and installed 11.10 as a dual boot with the pre-installed Windows 7 (for Skype and Spotify. Kill me.). I didn't like Unity, tried loading Gnome, and somehow things went very very wrong.\nIf I load 11.10 normally it loads with the broken/unusable Gnome interface, but somehow it loads fine through the recovery mode. I'd be happy to 'reset' the installation, install it anew, or simply get back to 10.04.\nAttempting to install 10.04 didn't work (it wouldn't boot for some reason), and loading the 11.10 installer won't solve it (the best it would let me do is wipe Windows 7 and install 11.10 on everything)\nAny solutions?\n\nA: Since you know you like Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and that is still supported, it seems like it would make the most sense for you to just install that.\n(Downgrading is not supported, so to go to 10.04 LTS, you'll have to do a fresh install. Since you have another OS--Windows, in this case--on the same machine, which I presume you want to keep, you should use GParted on the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS live CD--or any Ubuntu live CD, but you'll be using the 10.04 LTS live CD anyway if you're installing that version--to remove the installed Ubuntu 11.10 system's partitions, while keeping the Windows partition(s). That is, of course, assuming that you installing Ubuntu 11.10 alongside Windows, rather than inside it with Wubi. If you installed inside Windows with Wubi, then you should use Add/Remove Programs to remove it.)\nIf the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS install CD did not boot at all, that is likely due to a bad .iso image or a bad disc (or a corrupted USB flash drive, if you're trying to boot from one of those rather than a CD or DVD).\nTo test for a bad .iso image (used to make the disc or flash drive), see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM. To test the disc itself, you want https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Ubuntu_CD_Advanced_Welcome_Page_Options (select \"Check disc for defects\").\nIf the .iso image has a bad MD5 sum, you'll have to redownload it, test the newly downloaded image, and if that checks out, burn a new CD/DVD or write the new image to the USB flash drive. If the .iso image checks out but the disc or flash drive does not, then you'll have to burn a new disc or write the image to the flash drive again. If burning a disc, try burning it as slowly as possible, as that reduces the chance of errors. You should also make sure you are burning it to the CD/DVD or writing it to the USB flash drive using a correct procedure (click \"Show me how\" in Step 2 on the download page).\n", "Q: Wireless Internet Connection so slow after upgrade to 11.10 after upgrading my ubuntu to 11.10, my internet connexion became SO slow or it goes away for a couple of seconds. \nIt is a wireless connection, I have a dell studio 1525 and I have not install any additional driver \nI know that it is a general question, but I really have not any more information.\nThanks\n\nA: Same issue here with network controller: Intel Corporation WiFi Link 5100\nEverything was working perfectly with previous versions of Ubuntu but after updating from Natty 11.04 to Oneiric 11.10 the problems with N-Channel started.\nThe following commands solved the problem.\nsudo rmmod iwlagn\nsudo modprobe iwlagn 11n_disable=1\nTry browsing again and if there is an improvement, make this change permanent by creating an 'options' file:\ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf and add the line\n\noptions iwlagn 11n_disable=1\nHope this will help.\n\nA: *\n\n*First of all you need to check physically you wireless card ; by making connecting to your wireless network, if this succeed then ping to the localhost 127.0.0.1 if there no packet missing, then make ping to default gateway that is usually ends in .1 for example 10.0.0.1 (X.X.X.1 or X.X.X.255) if you test all this meas that your WNIC is  is working well!\n\n*The second think that you should do is test your Internet services provider by entering  to this web page: http://speedtest.net/ if your speed test don't agrees whit your ISP speed then you should call your ISP for technicals assistances \n\n\ntry to test it in Windows if this still happen my only conclusion is that you have a problem whit your ISP\n\nA: I had a similar issue, this link seems to be the fix! http://www.unixmen.com/linux-tutorials/linux-distributions/linux-distributions4-ubuntu/1785-resolve-slow-connexion-when-using-wifi-in-ubuntu-1104-natty-narwhal \n", "Q: How do I keep stored passwords from Ubuntu 10.04?

While it appears that there was a preliminary version of a Script-Fu script for generating small caps posted in 2005, it is no longer available.\n\nA: Extending on Ken Sharp's answer there is a more reliable way of doing the same.\nSince the edit box seems to still be buggy, you can edit the text the same way as in the mentioned answer by opening the non-buggy GIMP Text Editor.\n\nThen in the editor, you proceed as in the previous answer, by writing everything in caps, then highlighting the letters you want to be smaller, and changing their size.\nEdit: I somehow forgot I'm on an outdated PC and hence on outdated version of GIMP. This answer applies to GIMP 2.8.X and it should be probably taken only as a comment to the answer it's extending. \n", "Q: Where does Empathy go when minimized in Gnome3 shell? I'm trying out Gnome-shell instead of Unity and loving it.  Unfortunately I can't figure out where Empathy goes when I click the close button (there is no minimize button.)  I'm still logged in because I still get chat messages from people, but I can find no way to open the list of contacts to chat with.\nThere's no icon in the bottom right pop-up tray for it unless I have a pending message, and I can't use that icon to get the user list.  The only way I've found to get the user list is to launch Empathy from dash again.\nMy user name in the top right of the screen lists me as available for chat, but also has no way to open the list of people I can message.\nI'm wondering if something went wrong in my Gnome 3 setup somehow that has caused this because I can't find any other people complaining of this specific issue.\n\nA: When you click the close button, you've closed the window. So it's gone.  Empathy is still running, but without any open windows. There's info on restoring minimize/maximize buttons here:\nHow can I move Chrome's buttons to the right in Gnome3's Shell\n\nA: It sort of hides, but you can unhide it with Alt+Tab whenever you want. Also mind that when somebody talks to you, you will be able to reply through a small window in the bottom. \n\nA: Open Activites and right click on the empathy icon (in the dock or in the main Applications list) and select \"New Window.\"\nI have to say it isn't the clean, but it should work.\n", "Q: shell script to insert line into /etc/passwd , /etc/shadow ,/etc/group and save it Can anyone help me to add one line to any file from this:\n/etc/passwd , /etc/shadow ,/etc/group\nexp;  username:!!: ….  add to /etc/shadow by shell script without vi program\n\nA: Unless extraordinary circumstances make this unsuitable, it is preferable to make your script use utilities like passwd, usermod, groupmod, useradd, groupadd, adduser, and addgroup. (Check out the manual pages for those utilities, which are available on your Ubuntu system via the man commands and in yelp, and also on the web at http://manpages.ubuntu.com.)\n", "Q: How to maximise a window across two monitors? It's easy to maximise windows on a single monitor (press the maximise button, or drag the window titlebar to the top of the screen).\nHow can I maximise a window so that it takes up two screens?\n\nA: Drag your window until it snaps to one edge of first monitor then resize it all the way to the other end of the secondary monitor. It is not real window maximization, but it displays window content wider or higher if monitors are positioned one above other.\n\nA: You could use xdotool and setup shortcuts/scripts.\nI just did a quick test on a window and in my multi-monitor environment this made a window full screen across both monitors:\nxdotool search --name \"Untitled\"\nxdotool windowmove 96469240 -26 4\nxdotool windowsize 96469240 110% 110%\nI got the -26 4 starting coordinates by putting at top-left and xdotool getwindowgeometry 96469240\nAnd not sure why 100% was not stretching to actually 100% of the monitors...\n\nA: I wanted to elaborate on @codlord's great suggestion:\nMapping xdotool getactivewindow windowsize 110% 110% to a keyboard shortcut did exactly the trick (i.e., under Settings) - this should work regardless of the desktop manager (Gnome, Cinnamon, XFCE, etc.).\n\n*\n\n*You can quickly first test it out on a terminal window by entering the above command into that very terminal.\n\n*Note that on Debian/Ubuntu systems you may first need to install xdotool via: sudo apt install xdotool\n\n*The manpage man xdotool was very helpful and contains a lot of other neat ideas.\n\n\nA: This is possible by manually telling Compiz the screen output size, using the combined resolution of the two monitors. That's where the limitation kicks in: both displays need to have the same (vertical) resolution for this to make sense (else you'd end up with cut off content on the smaller screen or dead space on the bigger one).\nFor example, with two monitors with 1920x1080 resolution, you'd:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the CompizConfig Settings Manager (if you haven't already, install the compizconfig-settings-manager package) and go to the General Options plugin.\n\n*On the Display Settings tab, disable the Detect Outputs checkbox, select the 640x480+0+0 entry and click on Edit,\n\n*Now change this to 3840x1080+0+0 and hit close.\n\n\n\nCompiz should now treat your multi-monitor setup as one big output. \n", "Q: Appearance does not change on switching the theme If I select Radiance or Ambiance in the menu show in the following picture, my whole theme does not change. It only changes the title bar.\nHow can I resolve this problem? Or how can I reset the theme to default?\n\nA: Install dconf-editor if you don't have it, and then go to \n\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings\n\nand check \"active.\" One thing I've also noticed when this happens is that the media keys stop working: enable org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media keys. There also might be some more plugins you should enable. \nProblem cause: when unity-greeter is run (by the lightdm --test-mode command in my case), it disables a lot of settings-daemon plugins that have to be manually reenabled.\nI got all of my info from this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1861476\n\nA: Removing the file ~/.config/dconf/user solves the problem. \nPS: To reconstruct the problem I made the following steps:\nchange in the file /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf the line\nfont-name=Ubuntu 11\n\nto \nfont-name=Ubuntu 10\n\nand after saving run the command\nlightdm --test-mode \n\nThat was all I modified yesterday. Now if you restart your session with CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE and login again, your theme is ugly (like mine on the screen shot in my question). Can anyone verify this?\n\nA: I had the same problem after I ran unity-greeter in the terminal. From that moment on my theme did not load completely anymore. Only the title bar could be changed by selecting another theme. \nDeleting config files, logging out, dconf-editor settings and so on did not work for me.\nWhat solved the problem was to run /usr/bin/gnome-settings-daemon in the terminal. All settings were instantly in place.\nSo, I added it to the 'startup items' and the problem was solved. Everything works fine now.\n\nA: Basically, here's what happened:\nWhen you ran Unity Greeter, it started to really freak out, because its not supposed to be run as a normal user (although it is possible, I'll get into that in a moment).\nTo fix it, you need to go into dconf-editor (install the dconf-tools package), and then head to Org > gnome > settings-daemon > plugins, and then make sure that everything is enabled.\nLog out and back in and you should be good to go!\nTo run Unity Greeter/lightDM in a window so you can take screenshots, run \nunity-greeter --test-mode\n\nor\nlightdm --test-mode\n\n\nA: Have you tried logging out/logging back in? Typically on my install the theme switch does not complete until I do this.\nIt is curious that some of your desktop seems to revert back to the default GNOME theme, though.\nAlso, if this does not work, you may also want to try a reboot.\n\nA: I faced the same problem. After lots of search I came to know that gtk 3.4.2 was the root of the problem. I installed it for my programming purposes. Even the above solutions were not working in my system. So I just uninstalled it and it started working just fine.\n\nA: I ran into a similar problem on Ubuntu 14.04.  I was unable to change my theme after restarting my computer.  I could hack around the issue by logging out and logging back in.  I noticed this problem shortly after installing Ubuntu and installing some programs and drivers.\nResetting unity solved the problem for me.  I used the unity-tweak-tool to do this as unity --reset is no longer allowed:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\nunity-tweak-tool --reset-unity\n\nEdit The problem is back, this did not fix anything.\n\nA: Try running:\n    gksudo gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-settings-daemon.desktop\n\nand then replacing the line:\n    Exec=/usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gnome-settings-daemon\n\nwith:\n    Exec=bash -c \"sleep 5; /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gnome-settings-daemon\"\n\nYou might need to increase the sleep number.\nI got this from webupd8.\n\nA: I had the same issue in Ubuntu 13.04.

Sometimes removing and re-installing the Additions solves this.  Or simply forcing VirtualBox to actually load them, and not just download them.\nUnfortunately, this issue recurs.  I have found that updating VirtualBox (to a newer build) sometimes makes this worse AND sometimes solves this.  This is a recurring issue ..\n\nA: My system is 64bit Windows 7 SP 1 running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32 bit (i386).  I had to do almost everything for it to work.  To summarise:\n\n\n*\n\n*With the virtual machine shutdown, change the 'Settings' of the pertinent virtual machine.\nUnder 'Display' -> 'Video' move the video memory slider to '128mb' and also tick 'Enable 3D Acceleration'.\n\n*Now load up your Ubuntu virtual machine.\nUnder 'Devices' click on 'Insert Guest Additions CD Image'.  Wait for it to do its thing.\n\n*Restart the virtual machine.  You should now be able to achieve the higher resolutions.  If not, it may be because the virtual machine's window isn't large enough.  Drag the corner to make it larger or simply do:\n'View'->'Switch to Fullscreen'\nHope this helps someone.  Thanks to all the other answers for helping me out.\n\nA: I was able to reproduce this issue repeatedly on Windows 7 host with Ubuntu 11.10 guest. Installing ubuntu from an iso image.  \nThis issue happens when the either the Guest Additions are not installed or installed from ubuntu sources.\nTo fix this install guest additions from the virtual machine's Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image option and running the autoprompt.  If you already have the guest additions installed from a different source it will prompt you about removing the existing one and installing new guest additions, just say 'yes'.  This will remove the guest additions if they are already installed from ubuntu sources and build from sources that came with your virtualBox installation.\nThis should fix the issue.\n\nA: Entering the game lately, not sure this answer will help, but having a similar resolution issue (Mac host, Ubuntu as vbox), and after playing with xrandr, xorg.conf etc... I tried the following\n\n\n*\n\n*close Virtual Box\n\n*enter the host terminal command VBoxManage setextradata Linux CustomVideoMode1 1152x680x32 where Linux is the vbox name, CustomVideoMode1 is a name you give with 1 for one new resolution, 1152x680x32 for a 1152 x 680 x 32 bits colors resolution (VBoxManage.exe on Windows)\n\n*start your vbox\n\n*re-install the Guest additions\nworked immediately after a vbox reboot.\nmore info\n\nA: Using VirtualBox 4.3 on Windows 8 and guest Ubuntu 12.04\nI installed virtualbox guest additions from the iso file provided in the virtualbox install directory (used autorun.sh) + restart guest.\nI first thought it didn't work: the resolution was still low and screen parameters didn't show any higher resolution\nThen I realised the guest screen was in \"scale mode\" (host+c), I switched to full screen (host+F) and resolution was fine!\n\nA: I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on VirtualBox 4.1.4, but couldn't get it to work on higher resolution, even after installing and reinstalling the VBOXAdditions. Desperate, I installed the VBOX 4.1.14 and reinstalled many times the VBOXAdditions, but without any success.\nFinally, the solution that solved the problem, was to increase the video memory (in VBOX setting for Ubuntu) from starting 12 MB, to 48 MB (which still did not enable resolution 1366x768), and than to 128 MB. After restarting Ubuntu everything works perfect, 1366x768 is my default resolution.\nI hope this will help in your problems. Cheers!\n\nA: I was troubled with the screen resolution on Virtual Box on Windows 7 x64 as host and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS desktop as guest. I had raised the video memory to 128 MB, installed the VirtualBox Linux Additions, but it was still a no go. When checking the display setting in Ubuntu I could only choose between 800x640 (4:3) and 1024x768 (4:3).\nTicking the checkbox Enable 3D Acceleration in the virtual machine settings made it work. After that, when the guest window was resized, the size was reflected in the Ubuntu display settings. By turning on full screen mode I could use the full 1600x900 resolution in Ubuntu.\nHopes this might save someone's hair. \nUPDATE: After enabling 3D acceleration Ubuntu became extremly sluggish. So I unticked the 3D acceleration and I could still enjoy full screen resolution.\n\nA: Just run ubuntu on virtual machine and install \"VirtualBox Guest Additions\" (Devices -> Install Guest Additions). After the installation reboot your guest system.\nNow resolution will change automaticaly depending on window size.\n*I use Ubuntu 13.04 on VirtualBox 4.2.12 for Mac OS\nGood luck.\n\nA: Had problem with screen not full size after updates.  Running Ubuntu 12.04.  In the VBOXADDITIONS media I simply ran the autorun.sh - this uninstalled and reinstalled guest additions and then I rebooted and everything was back to normal.\n\nA: With Ubuntu 12.04 as host and guest I followed wfudge answer.\nThis requires other packages to be installed: \nsudo apt-get xserver-xorg-core\n\nAfter that, executed this modified line from wfudge hinted by apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-utils virtualbox-ose-guest-x11 virtualbox-ose-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-x11\n\nAfter that Ubuntu guest didn't boot into GUI, so with Ctrl+Alt+F1, logged in a console and executed:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nReboot and done. Now I can get higher resolutions up to 1600x1200. Still not 1920x1080 (host), so it's not full screen, but at least is much better than what I had before. \nI guess is a VirtualBox problem, but when used a Windows host didn't have this problem... \n\nA: For me (Host: Mac El-capitan, Guest: Ubuntu 14.xx LTS, VirtualBox: 5.0.12) the Ubuntu won't reboot (black or the default purple screen frozen) after guest installations via apt-get as described in most posts in this thread.\nFinally I used the official instructions from VirtualBox.

On restart it started changing it's resolution according to window size.\n\nA: I have same problem on my notebook DELL M6600 with Ubuntu 12.10. I had to install quest additions in windows safe mode. After that, desktop screen resolution was done by size of the window with guest OS. \n\nA: Sometimes it is very simple (refering to 12.03/4)  On the virtual machine window, hit the maximize button and it will fill screen, and cause Ubuntu to re-detect the screen resolution from the VM.\nElse, Christian Vielma's answer, doing all three steps one after the other, will enable this option.\n\nA: *\n\n*Close VirtualBox.\n\n*Paste this on Host Terminal:\nsudo VBoxManage setextradata NAME CustomVideoMode1 1152x680x32\n\nwhere NAME can be found in Settings → General → Basic → Name.\n\n*Restart VirtualBox.\n\nA: Using plain X11 without a heavy desktop client, ratpoison in my case, the following package is all that is needed:\nvirtualbox-guest-x11\nI understand other packages might make your kernel aware that it is running in a virtual environment for some benefits, but this package seems to handle the resolution issues.\n\nA: The only solution that worked was downloading the latest VBoxAdditions ISO from the Oracle website since the old ones don't work properly with DKMS.\n", "Q: How to permanently save powertop's suggestions? I run powertop then it suggests that I should disable xy, etc. However, after I exit powertop, reboot the pc, and start it again[powertop], it brings up the same tips again! So how can I permanently save the suggestions of powertop?\n\nA: Quick answer :\nYou just need to save them in /etc/rc.local.\n\nDetailed answer\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal run:\nsudo powertop --html=powertop.html\n\n\n*Step 1 generates a html file in your home directory. Click on that file so that it opens in your internet browser.\n\n*In the browser, go to \"Tuning\" tab. It gives all the tunings you have to tweak (on the left), and the commands that are implementing them (on the right).\n\n*Save these commands in /etc/rc.local.\nTo do that, in a terminal, run:\ngksu gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nWrite the commands before the line that reads exit 0, and save the file.\n\nA: Saving to rc.local as stagelll mentions is probably the simplest way to do it, but it's obviously only good for a local fix.\nAnother way would be to craft a udev rule that applies the setting for the device in question.  udev rules are more complicated to write but are safer to share with others.\nFor example, powertop suggested this:\necho 'on' > '/sys/bus/usb/devices/3-10/power/control';\n\nwhich solved the particular issue I was interested in.  But 3-10 is a bus number that's going to vary from system to system, depending on how the usb devices are attached.  After a bit of research and fiddling, I made a file /etc/udev/rules.d/10-usb-avocent-kvm-pm.rules with this rule, which sets power/control to on for my devices, wherever it might be connected in the USB subsystem:\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0624\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"0013\", ATTR{product}==\"SC Secure KVM\", TEST==\"power/control\", ATTR{power/control}:=\"on\"\n\n\nA: This doesn't exactly save your powertop settings, but it does  come with its own defaults which enable almost every powertop setting. It's called laptop-mode-tools. \nJust run sudo apt-get install laptop-mode-tools and run powertop, see if you like it. This also enables you to edit the settings, which in turn, edit the powertop settings. \nYou can edit the settings by running sudo gedit /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf Maybe someone else knows how to save the settings \"specifically\" from powertop. \nHere is a link for more information http://samwel.tk/laptop_mode/\n", "Q: What program can I use to open .mld (recorded webcam) files?

We were working on writing a paper while logged into an Ubuntu guest account. The paper was saved in the guest account's home directory. The computer froze, so we restarted. Ubuntu purged the files. Is it possible to recover?\n\nA: It is not true that there is no way to recover them. It is true that there is no particularly reliable way to recover them. And with all the time that has passed, it is quite unlikely they could be recovered now; I'm really posting this answer for others who experience similar situations in the future.\nWhen a file is deleted, such as files purged from /tmp, the data is not immediately destroyed, and it can persist for an extended time, and it can sometimes be recovered. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery for information about data recovery in the context of Ubuntu.\nContinuing to use your computer after you have deleted files that you want to recover significantly decreases the chance that recovery will be possible. So please do heed this warning (from DataRecovery):\n\nYou should NOT write to the failed device, as it can worsen a hardware\n  failure, and overwrite existant data in case of lost files.\nShut down the affected machine as soon as possible, and restart it\n  from a LiveCD or LiveUSB. Be certain that the \"live\" cd does not\n  automatically mount any partition or swap space.\n\nIn other words, stop using the Ubuntu system immediately, and only boot into either (1) a different system installed on the computer, or (2) better, a live CD/DVD or live USB flash drive.\n(Thanks to Joseph Kern for pointing out the importance of emphasizing the need to stop using the system if there is to be good chance of recovering deleted files.)\n\nA: The first thing to do is to stop using the filesystem immediately, as every write will reduce the chance of recovering files. \nI would recommend looking at using ExtUndelete as I have heard good things about it. I noticed that is it now packaged for Oneiric so booting a liveCD and installing it should not be an issue. \n\nA: first of all the GUEST account of Ubuntu is NOT like Windows Guest account. Every time you use a guest account the Ubuntu creates a temporary user in the /tmp directory.ALL THE WORK DONE IN THIS ACCOUNT IS DELETED as soon AS THIS Account is LOGGED of.\nYou should visit this link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery for further details \n\nA: Based on the clarification given by andol, since all the files were located in /tmp which was purged, there is no way to recover them.\n", "Q: How do I install OpenGLUT?

Whenever I search for an item using dash it knows the default way of opening it. However if I drag a file into the launcher it can't be added, even if it is executable. For example if you would like minecraft to show up you will have to add a custom launcher, or if you use dash to find a pdf file, you can double click it and it opens evince however you cannot drag it into the launcher.\nThe animation surrounding this behavior suggests that this was done by design. Why is this useful or necessary? Is it a bug?\n\nA: I would say it is by design - the space in the launcher is quite limited, adding there files, as opposed to programs would not make much sense - people have many thousands of different files on their computers, adding the ability to pin a few does not solve the general problem with finding files. Making it easy to find any file using Dash is a much better decision IMO - Unity Dash tries to address that. It also shows your recent files first.\nAlso, consider how the launcher would look if you pin more than one PDF file, for example - the buttons have no text, only icons. That would be highly confusing.\nIn your example with minecraft - it's not exactly an executable, it's a .jar file which is opened with java program - \"java -jar minecraft.jar\" - so, in a sense, it can be seen as a data file which can be \"viewed\" with java, the same as pdfs are viewed with evince.\n", "Q: Gnome 3.2 problems in the shell Does anyone experienced some problems in gnome 3.2 environment, like problems in the shell? \n\nHow can i fix it?\nI have made a test, if there was some problem on graphics, but everything seems fine:\n\n\nA: Install the latest ATI 11.10 drivers, people are reporting that updating their driver solves the problem for them.\nYou will need to remove all the current fglrx packages from your system and download the driver from the ATI site.\nRemove the fglrx drivers if you installed them\nsudo apt-get remove fglrx*\n\nDownload the newest ATI driver (current version is 11.12)\nwget http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-11-12-x86.x86_64.run\n\nIf you have a 64 bit system, then install this before anything\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nOnce downloaded go to the file location and set it to run as executable\ncd /path_of_the_file\nchmod 755 ati-driver-installer-11-12-x86.x86_64.run\n\nCreate the packages and install them on your system\nsh ./ati-driver-installer-11-12-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/oneiric\nsudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb\n\nOnce the driver is installed you need to start up a new xorg.conf file with this command\nsudo aticonfig --initial -f\n\nReboot\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: I had the same problem a few months ago.

I've been trying to find a good screen capturing program, and I've read some great reviews about Kazam, but they've all been with earlier versions of Ubuntu. Is it possible to install Kazam in 11.10? I've tried adding the unstable PPA to Software Sources, then running sudo apt-get Kazam, but no luck.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried the unstable daily build PPA, as that seemed to be the only one that was supporting Oneiric (it had packages for Oneiric, whereas in the stable daily build PPA, the packages were for Lucid and Maverick). http://launchpad.net/~and471/+archive/kazam-daily-builds\n\nA: Kazam is now updated on a more regular basis and more frequent releases can be found in the unstable ppa: https://launchpad.net/~kazam-team/+archive/unstable-series\nI've made only Oneiric and Precise builds. Anything older won't be supported anymore and there will be no backports (at least not by me). The reasons are many, one of them is availability of libvpx or libx264 in Natty.\nRecently I added support for GStreamer, PulseAudio and few more things. If all goes well, Kazam will be included in Ubuntu repo, before Precise is released, so no more PPA trouble.\n\nA: I had problems with Kazam installed in Oneric, it simply doesn't start, but to me it is the best screen recording on Linux and so I searched for the stand-alone portable version of it and it works perfectly. You can find the portable version here.\nJust download it, right click on  properties and set it as executable. Double click it and it's done.\n\nA: Apparently the reason why Kazam Screencaster isn't installing in 11.10 is because 11.10 doesn't come with some of the dependencies that KS requires that came with previous versions of Ubuntu. I did some searching, and found another PPA for KS that a user created. This PPA works in 11.10 because it has the dependencies that KS requires.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~vanhoof/+archive/kazam-scratch\nTo install Kazam Screencaster in 11.10 using the PPA above, just enter the following commands in Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vanhoof/kazam-scratch\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kazam\n\nHere's a second Kazam Screencaster PPA that you can use.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bigwhale/kazam-oneric\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kazam\n\n\nA: As mentioned today in OMGUBUNTU here: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/kazam-screenrecording-app-fixed-for-ubuntu-11-10/\nThe version of Kazam for Ubuntu 11.10  is now available.

(that's done through sshd config file).\nAdditionally if you know IPs of folks who need to access your home server you can tweak iptables to only allow connections from those IPs.\n\nA: Also disable root access via ssh, and enable MaxTries.\nVisit http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/security-tip-disable-root-ssh-login-on-linux/ for more information on it.\n\nA: In addtion to disabling password-based authentication, try this:\nsudo apt-get install denyhosts\n\nIt does wonders.

Would appreciate any insight....\n\nA: Direct answer\nIn order to achieve your goal (of running an X-session dependent user-space script when your machine resumes) you must:\n\n\n*\n\n*run the script as the appropriate user; and \n\n*ensure the DISPLAY variable is set. \n\n\nI would move the line sleep 15 && synclient TapButton2=2 TapButton3=3 to a separate file say /usr/local/sbin/setupTouchpad.sh and replace the line with:\n   export DISPLAY=:0\n   su -c - <yourusername> /usr/local/sbin/setupTouchpad.sh\n\nWhere <yourusername> should be replaced. Note that it is still a good idea to have some sleep time to be sure the system is awake before running the code. Also, be sure to chmod +x that setupTouchpad.sh script.\n\nA better way\nThe problem with the above is that you have to hard-code your username (or use some hackish way to discover which user is logged in and has the active X session). It's better to set system-wide touchpad settings for X.\nThese options may be set in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nFor me, the correct file to edit is 50-synaptics.conf here I've set options, here's a portion of that file:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n        Driver \"synaptics\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n\n        Option          \"TapButton2\"              \"2\"\n        Option          \"TapButton3\"              \"3\"\n\n        # Etc...\nEndSection\n\nAs you may already be aware, to see valid options simply run synclient. \nNote you must restart X for these changes to take effect. To do so in Ubuntu, for example, you can run sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm restart \nTo preview your changes you may try running the following line (or some variant). Remove  | bash from the end to see the commands it's issuing.\ncat /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf | grep Option | grep -v \"^\\#\" | awk '{print \"synclient \" $2 \"=\" $3}' | sed 's/\\\"//g' | bash\n\nIf you Google around for touchpad settings synaptics xorg.conf.d you'll find a few good overviews of options, also.\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10663041\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11642979&postcount=622\n", "Q: Will ASUS PCI-SC200 work with Ubuntu? I have a few piece of hardware from an early Paleozoic period that I am trying to get to work on Ubuntu. Namely a DDS1 tape drive with SCSI1 interface. I need to pick up a SCSI1 or SCSI2 adapter with PCI interface that will work under Ubuntu. Currently considering ASUS PCI-SC200, but can't quite figure out if it will work ok under Ubuntu(10.10). \nIf you have experience hooking up this SCSI2 adapter to a Ubuntu machine would really appreciate an advice if it's a good choice. \n\nA: So the answer to this is yes :) Bought it, tested it. It works perfectly well... which I can't say about my tape drive that chewed the tape :( Oh well...\n", "Q: Could not obtain c# compiler error when using monodevelop I dont know whether this is considered a programming question or not, so correct me if im wrong. How can i get mono develop to compile my c# projects?\nAt present it wont build, and i get an error saying 'could not obtain c# compiler, c# compiler not found for mono / .net 3.5' as i understand it, the c# compiler for mono is dmcs. Calling dmcs from terminal works fine. How can i get mono develop to build correctly? \n\nA: You can work around this by switching your project's runtime to .NET 4.0\n\nA: You also can stay with the previous mono/.net (such as 2.0, 3.0) by installing the respective compiler. Go to the Ubuntu Software Center, and search for \"C# compiler\", you will find the earlier compiler there.\n\nA: you can also install the compiler for the versions\nsudo apt-get install mono-gmcs\n\n", "Q: How to change the timing on the screensaver How can I change the timing of when the screensaver kicks in?\nThe time period set in the screensaver to kick in is too short and I would like to change this timing period to a larger value.\nHow does one do that? \n\nA: If you are running gnome it's done using 'gnome-control-center' and selecting the 'Screen' option. \nA bit hard to know if this is the answer for you with so little information given.\n", "Q: Duplicate icons in GNOME Shell A fellow user came across a problem, and it's the exact same one that I'm having. I'm just reposting here to see if there's a faster response (original Ubuntu Forums post):\n\nSo I have upgraded to oneiric and I was excited to get gnome 3 and so\n  i did and it's great, but in the applications menu many of the icons\n  are showing double, which is strange. One will be clear and the next\n  will be pixely. Also, this only happens when I'm in the \"All\"\n  category, and with the Faenza icon set the pixely one is not in the\n  Faenza style. I'm not quite sure how to fix this problem and I need\n  some help.\n\nA Google search turns up mostly closed Fedora-related bugs, so I'm not sure what I should do to try to fix this.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: In the Activities Menu, search for the \"Main Menu\" app, then uncheck or delete the categories you see selected under Debian. This removed every instance of duplicate low-resolution icons for me.\nEdit: I'd personally delete whole Debian icons tree - this will make sure those items aren't appearing even though you unchecked them, because I found this feature (disabling icons) buggy. Although there was problems which I stated a while ago, this was still solution of my problem.\n\nA: I found the answer in different place, just remove 'menu-xdg' and it will work.\nIt worked on my laptop, i removed it then restarted and every thing is great now !!!\n\nA: Go to - /usr/share/applications/ as root.\nFind .desktop files and delete them. But don't forget to make backup of those files.\n\nA: Removing the 'Debian entries' (by opening 'Main Menu') worked for me. Interestingly, those duplicate icons were also the poor resolution ones. Everything looks much better now.\n\nA: It's a common result of, for instance, entering a single wrong character while\nusing 'A lacarte' to install an icon.\n.............................................................................    \nThe file you we are looking for is...\nx-[app-name].xml\n...and the right folder is /usr/share/mime/application\ncd there as su -, rm and reboot.\n\nNote: Rename will have the same effect. You can delete it later\nanyway.\nmv x-[app-name].xml x-[app-name].xml-backup\n..................................................\nNow check your default icons and workstation.\nDoesn't hurt to run...\napt-get reinstall [app-name]\n...to make sure that the defaults are reset.\n..........................................................\nI remove the application first, the x-[app].xml is my second step. Third, install it again.  \n", "Q: What are kswapd0, kworker/num:num, ksoftirqd/num? Exactly what are these services / programs. Apparently they make my system almost useless.\nAny one of them at point of time uses at least 50% CPU and continuous access to HDD.\nI'm not exactly sure what exactly caused these to start.\nBut here are few things I've done (right before I noticed laptop being unuseful):\nStarting Gwibber services for twitter.\nInstalling mbrola (speech synthesis)\nInstalling gespeaker (downloaded from net its not available in repos).\nAnd I think all these services starts when I start any google page (gmail, google+ etc.) -- maybe related to google talk plugin?\nI'm gonna try not opening one of these pages (not sure for how long though)\nThanks \n\nA: This are kernel processes. kswapd is basically responsible for the swap space management. If it gets busy that's usually a sign that you are low on RAM. Quite likely it causes the HD activity, which in turn keeps kworker and ksoftirqd busy.\nSee Kworker, what is it and why is it hogging so much CPU? and Why is ksoftirqd/0 process using all my cpu? for an explanation about those processes.\n", "Q: Should I install the nvidia drivers for my computer after I've installed bumblebee? I'm running an optimus enabled laptop. I installed bumblebee and everything seems to work great. However I'm confused what i should do next. Should i install the nvidia drivers for my computer or would that screw everything up?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: No, the drivers are already installed as a dependency of Bumblebee, no more drivers should be installed after that.\n"]
