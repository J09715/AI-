["Q: Unable to detect graphics card in 12.04 LTS Hi I just recently installed Ubuntu onto my laptop (Dell Inspiron 15r 5520 64-bit) alongside Windows 8. While Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS seems to be working fine otherwise, in System Settings it is unable to detect my graphics card and shows as \"unknown\".\nI tried the following commands and this is what i get:\n$ lspci -v | grep -i vga\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Thames [Radeon HD 7500M/7600M Series] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n\nI have the ATI one as far as I know, so what's with the Intel VGA being displayed??\nSecondly, in System Settings > Additional Hardware I activated the ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver (post-release updates). The thing downloaded and installed itself and but it shows as \"The Driver is activated but not currently in use\". I don't really know what that means.\nAfter some digging around, I tried the following commands as well but to no avail:\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx*\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nNext I went to the AMD site and downloaded the requisite driver from here I followed the steps in their instruction manual, used the following command again:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\n\nand then went to the folder where I had download the driver and ran the installation file. I went through the setup process, did:\n/usr/bin/aticonfig\n\nand rebooted my laptop. Still I am stuck at square one, however, my Hardware info now shows the ATI VGA driver in addition to an Intel one. Here are the names:\n-PCI Devices-\nVGA compatible controller       : Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\nVGA compatible controller       : Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Thames [Radeon HD 7500M/7600M Series] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n\nAfter I installed the downloaded ATI driver and checked System Settings > Additional Drivers, I see that the Raedon VGAs have been deactivated again, as shown:\n\nHere is a link to the /var/log/Xorg.0.log. Hope all this info helps.\nPlease help me detect my graphics card, I need it for dozens of applications specially Compiz effects, games etc. I am a novice so kindly explain your answers as far as possible so that I can make the best of of them. Thanks in advance :)\n\nA: The display of the graphics card name in System Settings often does not work (just search askubuntu, there are dozens of questions about it and the answer is always the same...). I wouldn't worry about it and only trust other tools to find out which graphics driver is in use.\nYour laptop obviously has a recent Intel CPU, which includes a graphics unit. This is the reason, an Intel graphics card is shown in lspci.\nYour xorg.conf hints that atm you are using fglrx, and it seems to be working. To see, if the driver is really active, simply try to run fglrxinfo. Another tool that you might take a look at is amdcccle, the catalyst control center. It will give you a lot of details (if fglrx is installed).\nSince you installed the driver from the AMD website, \"additional drivers\" will not show any driver in its list as active (since you didn't use official driver packages for Ubuntu, but the download from the AMD website).\nI don't know about your laptop specifically, but you might find this guide useful: Installing Catalyst with Intel/AMD hybrid graphics \nOh, and btw, the preferred way to install the driver downloaded from the AMD website would be to make distribution specific packages and then to install those. By this, you can ensure that it stays working when you get Kernel updates. If you simply install it, it might be, that you have to reinstall it every time, a Kernel update is installed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu .pam_environment for non-login shell I remember in the past, we have two place to set env variables for Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Login shell - ~/.profile\n\n*Non login shell - ~/.bashrc\n\n\nBut now according to the doc [1], they are not recommended anymore. And we should use ~/.pam_environment, but my understanding is this is for login shell, so how about non login shell? \nWhere should I use?\n[1] https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\n\nA: ~/.pam_environment (and /etc/environment) is parsed when you log in (including when you log in graphically). After that, all processes run from a logged in session will inherit the environment variables set in those two files.\nNote though, that ~/.pam_enviornment is not a shell script. It only accepts KEY=VALUE pairs; it won't expand ~ or $VAR or any other such shell syntax, so it's not usable for all cases. If you want to prefix/append ~/bin to PATH for instance, you'll have to do that in ~/.profile. Because PATH=~/bin:$PATH won't be interpreted correctly by pam_env.\n~/.profile is also read when you log in graphically.\n", "Q: Too much disk read/write when launching an application I have Xubuntu 13.04 on an old Dell Inspiron with 1 GB RAM and about 2 GB swap. \nEach time I launch an application (e.g. Thunar or Evince) it takes a pretty long time to be launched and I see a lot of disk reads/writes. \nIf the system was short on memory, this would be understandable as the system would use swap. But that's not the case in my situation (i.e. I have this problem even when the RAM is almost empty). \nI had the same problem with this laptop with an older version of Ubuntu as well. Maybe the problem is with the old ATA drive?\n\nA: Most probably the settings of swappiness would be the key. Ubuntu by default is set to  swap the system resources before (not after) it will need to swap it. Fortunately, this option, as all things in Linux world, is configurable. \nTry to disable swap temporarily, to test, if this will help you, by \nsudo swapoff -a\n\nand later back on with\nsudo swapon -a\n\nIf this will be the solution for you, you can play with swappiness settings. This Q/A should be good guide for you (Is it safe to turn swap off permanently? ).\n... and yes, problem could be the old ATA drive, respectively the drive controller, as the I/O operations take longer than expected and system is waiting for it. Try to monitor system with top command, if this is the case, there will be lot of CPU waits (values more than 15-20%). You have to test it with app, which is not yet loaded into memory.\nIf this is the case, then consider to reduce I/O as much as possible. Play with swappiness (for example zero). It would help to add more RAM then, should have to be possible to increase it to at least 2Gigs. \n", "Q: Cannot delete a tar.bz2 file from pendrive I want to delete a tar.bz2 file from my pendrive.

Any help?\n\nA: you need to mount it in read write mode, since chmod is a write operation it will not work.\nCheck this instructions\nMake Read items RW\n", "Q: Drivers for HP Pavilion dv7-3165dx Hello I am installing ubuntu on my HP Pavilion dv7-3165dx laptop and was curious if there were drivers compatible with my laptop i did some searching and came up with nothing...the biggest things for me are the integrated webcam and wireless adapter drivers, as i am currently deployed in afghanistan and i have a baby on the way back home so i very much need to talk to my lovely wife. I just did the install and my graphics driver seems to be fine the only other problem i am having is with my wireless adapter it doesn't work so i assume ill need some kind of driver for it, after that i should be set to update and download drivers as needed from there. It looks like im running a Qualcomm Atheros AR9285 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter. Sorry if my question was kind of vague, and thanks for any help\nThanks Everyone\nJake \n\nA: Nvidia drivers (graphics) are working for 13.04.\nYou will find what you need here\n", "Q: How can I create a bootable iso from an extracted Ubuntu 13.04 iso? I have an extracted copy of Ubuntu 13.04 iso (live CD), but if I burn it directly it will not boot. Is there any way to create a bootable iso so that I can burn it to a DVD or USB flash drive? \nI tried ISO Master, but it first wanted an iso and allows me to add some more files. Can I use it to create iso only from extracted folders? \n\nA: An ISO if extracted, will loose it's capability to boot. Building ISO from this extracted files need to done in a special manner to set booting flag and other parameter\nYou just point your burning software to ISO (not extracted) , then the dvd/cd will be bootable.\nIf you want to customize ubuntu ISO, please see How to customize the Ubuntu Live CD?\nTo rebuilt from folder content, you can do so using powerISO (if on windows). Here is tutorial that may help you.. This option should be available with all standard burning software. Just check the manual.\n\nA: To make an ISO from files on your hard drive, you can use the mkisofs command.  To use it, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below: \nmkisofs -o /home/user/Desktop/test/Ubuntu.iso /home/user/Desktop/test\n\n(Using the command above, I have a folder called test in the Desktop folder, which will create the ISO in the same test folder, using only the files in the test folder).\nOnce created, then you can burn it to a DVD. \nNote: This will not create a bootable DVD.  To create a bootable DVD you need to get ISOLINUX, and you still can use mkisofs. \n\nA: The best option i can think of is to download Poweriso and extract it straight to the dvd. It should already be bootable after that. Did u delete the original iso and all you have is the extracted version? Sorry the only way i know is to have the iso, im not sure how if it is already extracted.\n\nA: If your system has grub installed, you do not need a DVD/usb to boot.\nPut your iso in the hard disk and modify the grub menu; this also lets you boot from an iso.\nWhy do you need to extract files from the iso?\n\nA: I use (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) - been using it for years to burn iso's to usb. To create an ISO file: \nOpen Terminal. Navigate to the directory you want to create the ISO in. then: \nmkisofs –o thefilename.iso /home/thepath/2/thefolder/ofthe/extractedfiles\n\n\nA: Web-E already gave a very good answer with the PowerISO tutorial.\nAs an alternative solution, I've found an interesting answer there:\nhttps://www.nextofwindows.com/how-to-re-create-a-bootable-iso-from-extracted-windows-installation-files\nIt's for Windows, but as this solution is very easy, it probably worths creating a small Windows booting disk, or use the mini XP Windows included in Hiren's boot live CD. I don't know if it's feasible, it has to be tested to answer this question, but the software used here, imgburn is compatible XP.\nConsidering you didn't touch anything in your files or folders of your extracted ISO, as it's obvious you cannot create bootable ISO from any kind of files or folder (bootable files that will pass important info to the bootloader are needed).\nIn the example, they use ImgBurn (Windows) with \"create image files from files or folders\". Ignore the parts regarding Windows files (like ei.cfg) as we aren't trying to make a bootable Windows.\nThey turned a bunch of .dll files and other formats, to an ISO file, and checked “Make Image Bootable“ in the section called Advanced → Bootable Disc.\nSo, it's exactly what you want to do, turning a bunch of files and folders, with any formats, to an ISO, and giving the ISO the instrinsic \"bootable\" property.\nOnce again, it won't be bootable if the ISO from which you extracted the files wasn't already a bootable OS type.\nThere are other software able to do the same: \nWiniso (their tuto is badly explained, but we see on the image that they used files and folders to construct their bootable ISO),   \nAdditional hints:\nAlternatively, if everything fails, software like AnytoISO to create an ISO from any kind of files, and using another sofware to make the ISO bootable, it can be made from the command line, or from a software.\nOne way to check if your extracted folders are able to boot is to extract the bootable file from it. They use UltraISO for that here,  “Bootable > Extract Boot File from CD/DVD”.\nI didn't test, but I imagine that if there's not boot-file in your folders, it may return an error message.\n\nA: I think the best way is to use Linux Live USB Creator to boot your USB from ubuntu .iso file.\nyou can download the .exe file from here and if you want to use it in ubuntu, I thimk you can run it with wine\n", "Q: Change color of top menubar / statusbar I know there are a million posts on this but not a single one has helped me solve this...\nI'm trying to change the color of the top menubar/status bar of the system. I've managed to set the transparacy of it using some fancy commands in the terminal but trying to change the actual color is a nightmare. It just stays black! I'm trying to set it to white.\n\nI've tried modifying the unity.css file of the theme I'm using by setting the @dark-bg-color and @dark-fg-color values but all that seem to do is change the menu colors of the windows that open up for each program, not the actual status bar of the system.\n\nA: The menubar color and the color for some other things can derive from your desktop wallpaper. Unity color is chameleonic. So you don't need to explicitly change the color of the menubar.\nFirst open CompizConfig Settings Manager, go to Ubuntu Unity Plugin, enable it and set Panel Opacity to 0 as in the following image:\n\nNow, when you will change your wallpaper, the menu bar will take the color of the wallpaper. Some examples:\n\n\n\nIf you want it to be almost white (well, completely white can not get because otherwise would not distinguish the text and the icons from the menu):\n\n\nA: If you're aware of CSS than you would have a greater control over color and style of the top panel. Following is how you can do it with Ambiance theme.\nOpen Nautilus as root, since you'll be backing up and editing files.\ngksu nautilus\n\nFrom here, make sure all file operations that you do are from this instance of nautilus that you opened using command.\nNavigate to /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps directory\nBefore you do anything, make copy of files unity.css and gnome-panel.css in the directory to somewhere in your home folder so that if you mess up anything, you can revert back the changes easily.\nSince you want to change color of top panel in Unity, open unity.css for editing in a text-editor (gedit).\nNow create CSS variable as follows at the topmost of the file\n@define-color dark_bg_color #DCDCDC;\n@define-color dark_fg_color #3f3f3f;\n\nNote that variable dark_bg_color indicates the panel background color you want to have, set its value with the hashcode of the color you want.\nSimilarly, variable dark_fg_color indicates foreground color i.e. font color of the panel items, set it with hashcode the value you want.\nFinally, save the file and exit. Logout, and login again, and changes you made should be visible. You can modify the values as you want, and in case you want to get back default panel color of Ambiance back, just open Nautilus as root and replace file unity.css with the one you backed up earlier.\nWhile above mentioned method can be used to tweak color of Unity top panel, you can make similar changes in gnome-panel in GNOME classic, by making similar changes in file gnome-panel.css.\nHope this helps....\n\nA: Look I know the guy above said otherwise BUT I found this... \nIf you go to the same directory as Radu said there is a setting for background color.\nI know this also changes the taskbar but you are able to change the menu bar to full white!\n", "Q: How do I switch from Ubuntu to Lubuntu? I have an installation disc of Ubuntu 12.04 but now I need to install Lubuntu 13.04. What are the steps to be followed?\n\nA: You can either install Ubuntu from the disk you have and then install the lubuntu-desktop meta-package.\nOr just grab and install from a Lubuntu CD. The bandwidth required will be similar.\n", "Q: How to remove unused application from the menu but not completely uninstall it on 12.04 LTS What I wanna do is not to uninstall certain apps but to completely hide it. For example I'm using VLC I didn't want to uninstall the default Movie Player, but I didn't want to have it run my videos either. \nThe problem with this app was that even if VLC was set as default video player on double click Movie Player started to play videos.\nMy solution for above mentioned problem was right click on video, properties tab, choosing VLC from list of recommended apps and setting it as default choice, however I had to repeat it different times (for each video type)\nAny suggestions how to force system to use my choice of apps.

Please give me more on this.\nAbout the video player issue, I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up your system settings by launching dash and searching for 'system settings'. At the bottom, there is the System section and inside a 'Details' icon. Click on it to view details about your computer. On the left side there is a sidebar, click on the 'Default Applications' menu and you can set your default application for different media including video. VLC should be in the video select and all you have to do is select it. \n\n*If you have installed Ubuntu tweak, you can use it to set default applications for different media types. This is for Ubuntu tweak 0.8.5. Launch up Ubuntu Tweak by searching for it in the dash, go to the admin tab on top, and then select 'File Type Manager'. On the right, there is a sidebar with different media types - Audio, Text, Video, Application and Image.

For easy access, put a symlink to the script anywhere in your PATH\"\nWhere should I put the script to run dropbox like other software which run from the terminal and the Dash?\n\nA: It doesn't really matter where you put that script, as long as you add the directory containing it to your PATH. You can do that by editing your .profile (type gedit ~/.profile in terminal) to add the line PATH=/path/to/script:$PATH (replace path/to/script with the correct path).\nHowever, it might be a bad idea to simply add any directory to PATH, because whatever is in it will be added. You might want to create a folder named bin in your HOME and put the script there; I believe it's fairly standard, and it should already be in your PATH if it exists.\n", "Q: Same keyboard layout, different outputs for different languages \n*\n\n*I have a UK keyboard, so UK-English layout\n\n*Need to type Portuguese and German characters (e.g. á, ã, ä...) \n\n*Don't want to buy a new keyboard\n\n*Don't want to change keyboard layout (standard Ubuntu functionality)\n\n*Why not?

On the apt-get man's page, one can find this: \n\ninstall pkg(s)\n  This option is followed by one or more packages desired\n  for installation. Each package is a package name, not a fully\n  qualified filename (for instance, in a Fedora Core system, glibc would\n  be the argument provided, not glibc-2.4.8.i686.rpm).\nAll packages required by the package(s) specified for installation\n  will also be retrieved and installed.\n  [...]  \nbuild-dep source_pkg\n  Causes apt-get to install/remove packages in an\n  attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a source package.\n\nIt sounds like both of those are trying to satisfy dependencies, but I had different results while installing matplotlib with each of those: apt-get intall didn't work with my subsequent pip install matplotlib in my virtualenv, while apt-get build-dep did*.\n* Yeah, I needed to install matplotlib in a venv, but pip couldn't resolve some of the dependencies, so I lazily used apt in order to solve it\n\nA: The short version.\napt-get install\n\ninstalls a new package, automatically resolving and downloading dependent packages.  If package is installed then try to upgrade to latest version.\napt-get build-dep\n\nCauses apt-get to install/remove packages in an attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a source package. \nThe command sudo apt-get build-dep packagename means to install all dependencies for 'packagename' so that I can build it\". So build-dep is an apt-get command just like install, remove, update, etc.\nThe build-dep command searches the local repositories in the system and install the build dependencies for package. If the package does not exists in the local repository it will return an error code.\nFor installing matplotlib see To Install matplotlib on Ubuntu\nSource:ManPage & Ravi Saive\n\nA: The difference is whether the dependencies are needed at runtime as opposed to at buildtime.\nFor instance, maybe I'm building a binary which uses openssl. At build time I would need the openssl header files, which are in libssl-dev. I would then list this as a Build-Depends. \nHowever, the resulting binary and package don't need the header and other development files, so at install time I don't need libssl-dev. It wouldn't be in Depends, then. But libssl, the runtime library my binary linked against, would need to be in Depends.\nThe man sections you quoted indicate this (it talks about \"satisfy the build dependencies\" of a package), but without prior knowledge of when Build-Depends are used, this can be confusing.\nHave a look at the Debian policy guide for definitions of control file fields:\nhttp://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html\nhere's the section on Build-Depends. Note it's under the \"dependencies for source packages\" header:\nhttp://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-sourcebinarydeps\nAnd this one talks about Depends.

Have no idea what to do \n\nA: How did you change partitions around or did you remove a Windows primary NTFS partition?\nWindows only boots from a primary NTFS partition with the boot flag. Normally all the boot files for additional installs are in that first install and later installs have no boot files. If second install is also a primary partition then it usually can be repaired to add boot files.\nBut if install is in sda5 that is a logical partition and not easy to boot. \nOnly with Windows XP can you do some work arounds and make it work, but better to have it in a primary partition sda1 thru sda4. You can also use tools to modify partition layouts to convert a logical to primary but that often depends on exact layout of existing partitions on drive. All logicals have to be together in one extended partition which counts as one of the primary partitions.

Python is an interpreted language, and you can run the scripts directly, either using:\npython hello.py\n\nOr make your script executable by adding #!/usr/bin/env python to the top of the script, making the file executable with chmod +x hello.py and then running:\n./hello.py\n\nThe fact that Python internally compiles your .py script to bytecode .pyc files for performance reasons is an implementation detail, and unless you have a strong reason to do so, let python itself decide when and if to compile.\n\nA: You may also try compileall:\npython -m compileall ./\n\n\nA: Check out this link Compile in Python\nIn the middle of the page, it talks about the py_compile module that can be imported.\nThe syntax is as follows:\nimport py_compile\n\npy_compile.compile(\"file.py\")\n\nThis method of compiling will not execute the module either like running python file.py.\nThere is also a method that compiles an entire directory tree but I'll let you check out the link to see how that is executed.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: UB 12.04 Desktop - System Update Server Main vs UK and DNS I am very new to Ubuntu :)\nI recently installed Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 - \nMy system detected (correctly) that I am resident of the United Kingdom\nand so it/I set my update server to the United Kingdom server.\nHowever, this was not a good choice for the following reason:\nAccording to the UK update server my system requires some 270 updates.\nHowever, when I try to install them I receive the message that \"these \nupdates would be from unauthenticated sources\" and then refuses to\ninstall any updates.\nI did some reading and found that it is recommended I use the \"Main\"\nserver for updates, so I changed to \"Main\" and ran the update process\nagain, only to find that my system is FULLY up to date and there are\nZERO outstanding updates to apply to my system.\nOK .. so that solved something which really should not be a problem \nin the first place.

Then I did\nsudo kill -TERM <PID>\n\nSo you get  of downloading process and you     kill it.\nNext, I did a\n sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nand waited for the result... after that i did a regular.This configures (--configure) all the packages (-a) which are yet unpacked and unconfigured, using dpkg.)\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nsudo apt-get update synchronizes your list of available packages with the servers in source repositories.\nsudo apt-get upgrade then downloads & installs any newer versions of your installed progs.\n", "Q: Problem in uninstalling ubuntu 12.04 I installed ubuntu 12.04 using wubi. But there is no application named \" uninstall-ubuntu \". Now how can I uninstall it ?\n\nA: Did you completely install ubuntu onto another partition or did you just install it within windows? If you just installed it within windows you should be able to go to \"Programs and Features\" in the control panel, find Ubuntu and uninstall it that way.\n\nA: This is more like a Windows question than Ubuntu. It's like \"How can I remove a Windows application ? \" because wubi is exactly this. A Windows application - helper to install Ubuntu inside Windows.

At this point, I can't even boot into Windows (although I have an installation cd to fix the windows boot issue, that would ultimately screw over ubuntu).\nUpdate 3: After doing a little more browsing around, I found a cool way around this messy grub stuff, using rEFInd.

Still, after experiencing a similar nightmare with my laptop, what finally did it for me was realizing that I can't install grub too far into the drive; You don't say what partitioning scheme you tried, so I figured this might be the issue you're experiencing as well.\nWhat I did was keep the UEFI structure intact (or, rather, allowing the Windows installation disc to create a new one from scratch), but I made sure to have a small (200MB) dedicated partition located relatively close to the beginning of the drive (around 400MB into it) which Windows leaves alone. (I can't stress enough, though, that it should still be Windows that partitions the drive. The way I did it, I completely removed the filesystem, then created a 400MB partition, my dedicated partition after it, then erased the original and let Windows do its thing with what's left. I'm sure you could simplify the process somehow, but I was seeing stars by that stage.)\nThen, after Windows was done making a clean install in the rest of the space allotted to it (and, in the process, creating the necessary UEFI structure before my partition, and a Windows partition immediately after), I simply replaced that partition with an ext4 partition during the Ubuntu installation and mounted it as /boot, installing grub to it.\nEverything worked fine after that (after running boot-repair, that is).\n\nA: I had same problem and i find this program and it fixed dual boot problem. \nI try to do in grub comment line. I have done everything wrote on forums. At the end,i download this program and run at terminal.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: I encountered a similar issue. Windows is installing boot information to a different partition. The solution I found was to boot my installation media and choose repair (to enter the WindowsPE environment.) From there you may access a command prompt with keyboard shortcut shift+f10\nI issued the following commands:\nbcdedit /enum all\n\nThis is listed all the boot information Windows had and where it was located. I determined that Windows had put boot files on another partition \"D\"\nI issued the following command:\nrobocopy d:\\Boot c:\\Boot /mir /xf bcd.*\n\nFrom this point all the information was copied to the correct partition C.\nWe also need to fix up the {bootmgr} device entry:\nbcdedit /store c:\\Boot\\BCD /set {bootmgr} device partition=C:\n\nYou should now be able to boot successfully; reboot and try.

I have a new Asus Zenbook UX32V with:\n\n\n*\n\n*24GB Sandisk SSD\n\n*500Gb Hitatchi\n\n\nIt came with Windows 8 but I've successfully installed Ubuntu 13.04 dual boot and everything works great. Now I've spent some time with it and loving Ubuntu (and hating win 8) I would like to go back and ditch the dual boot and just run Ubuntu. Boot time is sluggish and I really hate and have no need for windows 8.\nLooking at the disks tool on Ubuntu I can see I have the above drives, the SSD seems to be taken up with:\n\n\n*\n\n*IntelRST 6.4Gb (mountable)\n\n*HST 18Gb (Unknown)\n\n\nMeanwhile the 500Gb regular drive is filled with 9 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*system\n\n*recovery\n\n*microsoft reserved\n\n*Win 8 OS\n\n*Data\n\n*Ubuntu file system\n\n*Linux swap file\n\n*restore\n\n\nSo basically I suspect Ubuntu is not using the SSD at all.

This does have a relation to your user since this is about editing multiple files in a project like setup.\n\n\nRegarding the last option: software like Eclipse, Aptana can make a workspace directory but some do not do this in /home/$USER/ by default. Aptana creates it based on an INI file that has \"osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/Aptana 3 Workspace\" in it. Eclipse uses \"osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/some_workspace\".\nWhere you create this is probably a 1 time question when you start that editor the 1st time (and a setting that allows you to have it ask everytime on startup).\nTo me it seems logical you also included some other software (and my bet would be a code editor like Eclipse) and omitted this the 2nd time.\n", "Q: Can't boot windows after installing Ubuntu Okay, so today I installed Ubuntu.

I'm having problems with PCLinux and would like to install Ubuntu over it.  If I do that, will my files be retained?  Is there anything I need to do to ensure that they are not lost?\n\nA: You shouldn't have any loss of data if you install Ubuntu on your hard disk as a dual boot system.  But since you want to install over, I would highly recommend that you backup all that you need before installing Ubuntu, because you will lose your data, since the installation will erase your partition.  \nFor info on how to backup, see Backup Your System.  For more info on how . to install Ubuntu see Install Ubuntu 13.04, and for 12.04.\n\nA: If you are just concerned about your files, just do a backup by copying the files you want to keep, such as your entire home directory, to an external hard drive or usb. To answer your question on whether you files will be retained if you just install over PCLinuxOS, the answer is no they will not.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu over PCLinux will cause the PCLinux partition to be formatted (wiped) - any data on it will be lost. Unless your hard disk has multiple partitions - or your computer has multiple hard disks - to which you can move your files, you will need to back them up onto a memory stick or external hard drive before you install Ubuntu.\nThe following web links may be of use:\nHow to Back Up Your System\nDetails on Installing Ubuntu\n", "Q: How do I set up pretty printing gdb 7.5 I thought gdb 7.0 and higher has pretty printing included in it but I might be wrong?

On command line run sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev to install library named libxml2-dev, and then run make etc.\n\nA: So you are new to linux and work with Ubuntu 10.04? Actual version is 13.04. Your problems might result from missing or outdated packages. When compiling, the program doesn't find that Information.\nUpgrading your system will be the best solution for a lot of problems, you will run in soon. I'm not sure though, if you can do that over the update manager, because 10.04, although Long Term Suppport LTS, isn't supported any longer (since May 2013). Actual LTS is 12.04.\nOpen your update manager, which should be in Applications - Administration or - System. I don' t remember as I work with Unity. Then look if there is an item saying \"Update to new Version\". If it is 10.10, then I would recommend to download actual version and replace the old system. \nIf your Hardware is also outdated, then you should consider installing Lubuntu, which is a lightweight version of Ubuntu.\nhttp://lubuntu.net/\nThen compile and install missing packages, if that's the case.\n", "Q: Mac OS X dual boot with encrypted Ubuntu LVM I'd like to Setup my Mac Book Pro with dual Boot Ubuntu 13.04 & OS X Mountain Lion.\nBecause the machine contains corporate data, I need to encrypt both Operating Systems.\nWith Mac I can use FileVault. For Ubuntu I need an encrypted LVM (am I right?).\nI can't setup Ubuntu with LVM because it wipes my entire disk and can only use the whole disk to init LVM. I need both aside, so this doesn't work for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to encrypt the Ubuntu partition if there is no LVM?\n\n*Can i setup LVM and not use the entire disk?\n\n\nA: I've never done anything like this but I would backup Mac OS X and install Ubuntu with encryption and LVM which is an option on the installer which will also wipe the disk. Then you can resize the encrypted Ubuntu (which you can look up how to do) so you have space to install Mac OS X. Then restart your Mac and hold alt on boot. Then you connect to internet. Then you'll see an internet recovery option, which you click and use restore from backup. Then you should have a dualboot. I think.\n\nA: Why dual boot? Dual booting is rather antiquated, imo. By using a vm you can run both systems at the same time. This is how I have my macbook configured and it works a charm. Just install the mac os encrypted, install vmware fusion, and install ubuntu in a vm. Because the drive is encrypted beneath the vm, you can have access to both systems soon as you log into the mac.\n", "Q: Cleaning up and changing the EFI boot order permanently using eifbootmgr Alright, so after a few days of figuring out how to dual-boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04, I made rEFInd my default bootloader.\nMy problem now lies in my EFI setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu (ST1...don't feel like typing that out lol)\n\n*Windows Boot Manager (ST1...)\n\n*Windows Boot Manager (ST1...) \n\n*EFI Network 0 for IPv4\n\n*EFI Network 0 for IPv6\n\n\nHere is the thing: 1 and 2 do not work, but I don't want to get rid of them for now. 3 is where my rEFInd is, and I want this to be at the top. Every time I turn on the computer, this is the default boot order. I can change it each time I boot up, but I would prefer not to do so.\nI noticed that there was some program eifbootmgr, but I am not exactly sure how to use it. Basically, I want to permanently reorder the list to: 3,4,5,1,2. \nIf I could get a guide as to how to do so, I would appreciate it :)\nUPDATE:\nRod, so I took screenshots of what happened, and I had a weird result in the boot menu...\n\n\n\nA: Type sudo efibootmgr -v to view your current boot entries. After you type your password, you'll see something like this:\nBootCurrent: 0003\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nBootOrder: 0003,0002,0000,0001\nBoot0000* rEFInd Boot Manager   HD(1,28,96000,bc34b60c-6611-492f-99b0-d2c37bd77f48)File(\\EFI\\refind\\shim.efi)\nBoot0001* fedora    HD(1,28,96000,bc34b60c-6611-492f-99b0-d2c37bd77f48)File(\\EFI\\fedora\\grubx64.efi)\nBoot0002* rEFInd (via PreLoader)    HD(1,28,96000,bc34b60c-6611-492f-99b0-d2c37bd77f48)File(\\EFI\\refind\\PreLoader.efi)\nBoot0003* ubuntu    HD(1,28,96000,bc34b60c-6611-492f-99b0-d2c37bd77f48)File(EFI\\Ubuntu\\grubx64.efi)\n\nYour details will be different, of course. You need to identify your entries and figure out the order in which you want them to appear. For instance, suppose you had these entries you wanted to boot rEFInd via shim by default, then rEFInd via PreLoader second, followed by Ubuntu and then finally Fedora if all the others fail. The desired order would then be 0000,0002,0003,0001. You can then specify that order via the -o option to efibootmgr:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0000,0002,0003,0001\n\nThe output will include a less verbose repeat of the original output, with the BootOrder line changed appropriately. Double-check that your changes are correct, then reboot to test that it's working. (Unfortunately, some EFIs are buggy, and there have been bugs introduced by mismatches between efibootmgr and the kernel in recent months.) If you have problems, there are ways to fix it with an EFI shell and its bcfg command, but I'll omit the details unless you report back that efibootmgr doesn't work.\n\nA: Unrealistic you are making this harder than it needs to be go into BIOS boot menu where your options are osmanager, USB, disk, ect. Highlight osmanager press enter it will open a sub menu use f5,f6 to rearrange to your liking use f10 to save your changes and then f10 the save again and exit\n", "Q: How to reboot after resetting password Recently I had a problem with the authentication in ubuntu 12.04.

I want to remove Windows Vista from my PC so I want to transfer all my files to Ubuntu, \nI haven't tried any thing yet, only want to know if there is a quick and easy way of doing it.\n\nA: Normally your Windows partitions are automatically mounted at startup of Ubuntu, and you can easily transfer files between Windows and Ubuntu, but if anything goes wrong, don't panic, you can make through this way:\nFind the disk drivers\nFirst of all, you have to find your windows' partitions, to do so, run this command:\nfdisk -l\n\nit gives you a list of partitions available, windows' partitions are NTFS formatted, find the partition you want to transfer files from, let's say it's /dev/sda3 for example.\nCheck if the partition is mounted\nNow you have see if the partition you want to transfer files from is mounted or not, to do so, run this command and replace /dev/sda3 with the one you found:\nmount | grep /dev/sda3\n\nif any result comes out, it's mounted and you know where it is mounted, for example my result was:\n/dev/sda3 on /media/mahdi/Gamez type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n\nIf the partition wasn't mounted and your mount | grep /dev/sda3 gave no result, mount the drive to a folder, it can be any empty folder you want!\nFor example you can make a folder called \"windows\" and mount the windows partition on it this way:\nmkdir /media/windows\nmount /dev/sda3 /media/windows\n\nTransfer Files\nThe easiest step, uh. Just copy the files from the mounted partition to your Ubuntu partitions and there ya go!\n\nA: You should be able to view and copy all your files while booted into ubuntu since ubuntu can read and write to ntfs partitions.

I was about to replace my hdd and was thinking of doing this. Would it be especially unstable in terms any settings files which might be in conflict?\n\nA: as far as I know HOME folder consists of private information of a user. sometimes Its a good idea to have but not every time regarding a common Home folder partition. \nBecause Different versions of Ubuntu you'd like to use. They will consists of different configuration files and they may conflict with each other If you are supposed to use both of them for different purposes.\nI found something for you , actually its not exactly what you have asked but its worth reading Multiple Users, Single Workstation, 1 home folder (Can this be achieved, if so how?)\n\nA: I would not advice you to do that!\nNewer releases has newer version config files. When you boot back to an older system your applications may start to misbehave since the config files are for a newer version.\nOn my laptop I have Karmic, Lucid and Precise and they all mount the same home folder. My home directory on these systems are different (/home/sylwester-lucid for lucid, ...), but I have a shared directory for the XDG directories. So my Desktop, Documents, and other folders that Ubuntu has as default places are shared.\nYou set the absolute path to those directories from gedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. You may choose to have them in the system you use the most or in a separate one. The latter makes it easier to clean up when you decide to remove a system. \nTo make other directories available you can just add it as a bookmark or hold down CTRLSHIFT while dragging extra folders from the shared space to one of your installations home folder. This will make a symbolic link that justs opens the original folders.\n\nA: It may be OK, but I have another method that works out better for me.\nI have a partition with directories for documents and media files, and I create symbolic links to them; then, I delete the directories in my home directory, and replace them with the links, using the exact same name.  If you use the same name, and do it all without logging out, then the links will get the same icons as the original (it's set in a config file, and be be changed, but it's easiest to just do it this way).\nOne nice thing about this method is that I share these files with any distro I want to test, and I can also share it with Windows if I have it.  Windows (at least recent versions including XP) allow you to change those directories.\nIf I want to change distros, or reinstall, it's pretty easy to do\nAnother way would be to mount the partition into the folders in the home directory, although I haven't tried this - just something I thought about later.\n\nA: I currently do this with my system. I use backbox which is ubuntu 12.04. And Kubuntu 13.04. There is a shared /home partition. This way I can use both sides equally. \nThe thing I found though is you WILL have to use the same user name on both partitions. Also you will have to create this partition on install.\nFor example:\nThe first install would be backbox, you would create a partition of backbox then a /home partition from the drop down menu.\nThe second install would be the ubuntu. After the ubuntu, you would have to make a mount point to the /home for your user home. Then edit your /etc/fstab to make it survive a reboot. \nThis is assuming your system doesn't figure out what's going on at first. Sometimes ubuntu will solve the problem of mounting the partition as your home on it's own, sometimes it will not. I don't know why either.\nOne more note, this can not be down between fedora and ubuntu. Any redhat distros starts the UID at 500 while ubuntu starts at 1000. \nI hope that answers your question. Install the earlier version first create the home during that install and install the newer version second. It should play nice. If not, mount the /home as your home and set it to become permanent in your /etc/fstab. \nAnd one last warning, if there is special configuration files in the /home, they might fight. I personally haven't had this problem. I like kde and gnome. I think two gnomes will fight. \n", "Q: Failed to download repository information. Check your internet connection.

Here are some of my outputs:\nsudo apt-get update\nHit http://repo.steampowered.com precise Release.gpg\nHit http://repo.steampowered.com precise Release                                            \nHit http://repo.steampowered.com precise/steam amd64 Packages                               \nHit http://repo.steampowered.com precise/steam i386 Packages                                \nIgn http://repo.steampowered.com precise/steam TranslationIndex                             \nIgn http://repo.steampowered.com precise/steam Translation-en_CA                            \nIgn http://repo.steampowered.com precise/steam Translation-en                               \nHit http://extras.ubuntu.com precise Release.gpg                                            \nHit http://extras.ubuntu.com precise Release                                                \nHit http://extras.ubuntu.com precise/main amd64 Packages                                    \nHit http://extras.ubuntu.com precise/main i386 Packages                                     \nIgn http://extras.ubuntu.com precise/main TranslationIndex                                  \nIgn http://extras.ubuntu.com precise/main Translation-en_CA                                 \nIgn http://extras.ubuntu.com precise/main Translation-en                                    \nHit http://archive.canonical.com precise Release.gpg                                        \nHit http://archive.canonical.com precise Release                                            \nHit http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner amd64 Packages                             \nHit http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner i386 Packages               \nIgn http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner TranslationIndex            \nIgn http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner Translation-en_CA                          \nIgn http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner Translation-en                             \nGet:1 http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security Release.gpg [198 B]        \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security Release                      \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/main amd64 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/universe amd64 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/multiverse amd64 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/restricted amd64 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/main i386 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/universe i386 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/multiverse i386 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/restricted i386 Packages\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/main TranslationIndex\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/multiverse TranslationIndex\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/restricted TranslationIndex\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/universe TranslationIndex\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/main Translation-en\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/multiverse Translation-en\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/restricted Translation-en\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/universe Translation-en\nErr http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com precise Release.gpg                                        \n  Something wicked happened resolving 'ca.archive.ubuntu.com:http' (-5 -

This can damage your system. You will have to edit this in root with gedit/kate/vi.\nI added a steampunk theme not to long ago, but they did not have a 64bit package and I had these errors because of it.

I have a computer that I am using for work that is running Ubuntu. I need to transfer files constantly between Ubuntu and Windows. What I have been doing is saving the files on a USB stick drive, and then plug that stick drive to the Windows machine many times a day.\nI replaced my router with the one that has USB, and bought an external hard drive so I can transfer files more easily. I set it up in Windows, but have no clue how to do it on Ubuntu. \nWould you be able to do a step by step in how to do this? I got the router IP address already.\n\nA: Your windows and Ubuntu 12.04 should already be able to transfer files between each other over the network using samba/windows shares.\nIn the file browsers search your Browse Network/Network Places and see if you can find each of the computers.

I had Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a secondhand PC I bought sometime back and I have to say it's better than Windows any day. However, I now need both Windows and Ubuntu on my PC. I've already backed up my data and burned a Windows XP SP3 installation CD.\nOne of my biggest problems is that my hard drive, which is about 320 GB SATA, has about 4-5 partitions and 2 unallocated ones of about 5 GB and 7 MB.

Should I go in for a complete format?\n\nA: Sounds like you're on the right track. Installing Windows before Ubuntu works best.\nOne way to format the drive is to use a Linux distro with GParted on it that runs from a CD. This way the drive is not mounted. I don't think you can safely format a mounted root partition.\nWhat you want to do in GParted is delete all partitions then apply. That should be fine. Windows should be able to then format the drive during the Windows installation process. Have Windows only create a partition for itself, leaving space for Ubuntu.\nIf you have issues, you could drop to the Windows console during the installation process and run fixboot and fixmbr. When you install Ubuntu, GRUB will take over the Master Boot Record process.\nYou're on the right track.\n", "Q: How to upload software written in Gambas into a Launchpad PPA?

I then installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 on it. Both OS's are running fine for now but the problem is that I have to manually go into BIOS on startup and switch between Legacy and UEFI mode to boot into Ubuntu and Windows respectively. Is there anyway that I can just get GRUB to ask me on startup which OS I want to boot?\nIn case it is important, here's what I did to install Ubuntu -\n\n\n*\n\n*I shrank the Windows partition and then disabled SecureBoot and switched to Legacy mode.\n\n*While installing Ubuntu from the Live CD, it did not detect that my system already had Windows 8 installed.\n\n*I chose to manually allot partitions to /, /home, swap, /boot during installation.\n\n*It also told me that there needs to be a Reserved BIOS setup partition, so I let it create that.\n\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Try boot-repair to reinstall and configure grub.\nBoot to live cd desktop and open terminal then type\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\nWait for it to finish then type\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nNow you can launch from dash and follow the instructions.\nHeres a link to detaild documentation https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: If the installer asked for a bios_grub partition, you installed in BIOS/Legacy/cSM mode not UEFI. How you boot installer is how it installs. And only if you get grub menu on installer have you booted in UEFI mode.\nBoot-Repair simplifies the BIOS repair. Without it you either have to reinstall or chroot into your install and uninstall grub-pc and install grub-efi and edit fstab. Boot-Repair does all that automatically.\nAlso Boot-Repair will add correct Windows chain load entries that grub2's os-prober does not create. os-prober creates the old BIOS entries that do not work with UEFI. Fix just released, but not in any live installers except maybe 13.10, but I have not checked that, yet.\nMany UEFI have been modified to only boot Windows. This is where a hack or work around is required. Since grub2's shim has the Microsoft signing key, it can become the Windows boot file (that UEFI thinks is the real file) and you actully boot grub. Then from grub menu you chainload to boot the renamed actual Windows file. For some systems that is the only way to boot. But Boot-Repair automatically does that rename and it is not required for some systems.\n\nA: As Mark Kirby says, Boot Repair may fix the problem; however, Boot Repair applies certain hackish \"fixes\" in all cases, and this can sometimes cause subsequent problems. Furthermore, what Boot Repair does sometimes doesn't work at all, which leads to further complications. Personally, I prefer doing this repair using finer-grained tools. One method is:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows, download and install my rEFInd boot manager. The Web page includes Windows installation instructions.\n\n*Install the EFI driver (in the rEFInd package) for whatever filesystem you're using on your Ubuntu /boot partition.\n\n*Reboot into Ubuntu using your legacy boot method.\n\n*In Ubuntu, run the mkrlconf.sh script that comes with rEFInd. (Change to the directory that holds the script and then type sudo bash mkrlconf.sh.)\n\n\nWhen you reboot in EFI mode, rEFInd should appear, and it should enable you to run either Linux or Windows. If rEFInd does not appear when you reboot, then chances are you've got a buggy firmware, and it may be that the type of hackish fixes applied by Boot Repair are necessary. You can either run Boot Repair to make GRUB the default or reboot into Linux (in legacy mode) and use the mvrefind.sh script that comes with rEFInd to make rEFInd the default:\nsudo mkdir -p /boot/efi\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi\nsudo bash /path/to/mvrefind.sh /boot/efi/EFI/refind /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot\n\nChange /dev/sda in the second command to your EFI System Partition (ESP). This partition shows up in parted's output as having its \"boot flag\" set. Also change /path/to to the path to where mvrefind.sh resides.\n", "Q: I am trying to check the mysql bind address int the terminal but keep getting error can someone help? I am trying to check the mysql bind address in the terminal using the command cat/etc/hosts | grep localhosts that I got offline, but I keep getting a bash: cat/etc/hosts: no such file or directory error can someone please help?\n\nA: You need to separate the command and its arguments with whitespace. In this case, cat is the command, and /etc/hosts is its argument. You also have a grep command with localhosts as argument, there you do have the required whitespace. So cat/etc/hosts should be cat /etc/hosts.\nNow, if you want to query the hosts database, I recommend using the getent command instead of grepping /etc/hosts directly.\ngetent hosts localhost\n\n\nA: Why don't you try with:\ncat /etc/hosts | grep localhost\n\n...? Is more efficient as long as bash does not recognize yet commands and arguments written together without spaces.\nSo add a space between cat and /etc/hosts and grep for localhost, not localhosts.\n", "Q: Zombies are taking over my computer I can see several zombie processes in my computer.

You have three choices: Fix the parent process (make it wait); kill the parent; or live with it. Remember that living with it is not so hard because zombies take up little more than one extra line in the output of ps.\n[...]Zombies that exist for more than a short period of time typically indicate a bug in the parent program. As with other leaks, the presence of a few zombies isn't worrisome in itself, but may indicate a problem that would grow serious under heavier loads.\nTo remove zombies from a system, the SIGCHLD signal can be sent to the parent manually, using the kill command. If the parent process still refuses to reap the zombie, the next step would be to remove the parent process. When a process loses its parent, init becomes its new parent. Init periodically executes the wait system call to reap any zombies with init as parent.\n\nSee also this post about how can you get rid of zombie processes.\n\nA: At least for pidgin, this seems to be a bug due to problems with going in and out of hibernation:\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pidgin/+bug/1245666\n\nThe vlc zombies are probably just a coincidence caused by errors in that program.\n\nA: For me each time I open a new video  (from file explorer) a new (or som) process is created and keeps 'alive' in some way (at least an icon appearing on the 'task bar'.\nI saw a recommendation (sorry to don't remember the author) to change the video output for OpenGl, this disn't work.\nAnyway when I changed the video output for XBC it worked.\nThe problem occurs with VLC from snap AND apt.\nMy solution:\n\n*\n\n*Close/kill all 'alive' process (kill -9 vlc)\n\n*rm -r ~/.config/vlc\n\n*run vlc alone ($vlc)\n\n*Tools > Preferences > Video > Output XCB > Save\n\nI changed both outputs ( output and full screen output) to XCB.\n", "Q: How can I get Skype Video working on Ubuntu 12.04 64bit I understand it requires, libv4l1 but I cannot get 32bit version for it, for some reason from apt-get.\nlocate libv4l\n/usr/lib/vlc/plugins/access/libv4l2_plugin.so\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l1.so.0\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l2.so.0\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4lconvert.so.0\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4lconvert0\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l2convert.so\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4lconvert0/ov511-decomp\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4lconvert0/ov518-decomp\n\n... and so on.\n\nA: The correct command is\nsudo apt get install libv4l-0:i386\n\nto get the i386 in a 64bit system.\n", "Q: Sound volume keys sometimes stop working in 13.04 I have a Ubuntu 13.04 installation (with xubuntu-desktop installed if that matters).

I've never used it, but I'm pretty sure that's what it's for.\n\nA: The only way to make use of the two computers in your situation is to have a programm that is intended to run on multiple separate computers, and run that on both computers. \nIt is true that there are general solutions to distribute computing work to multiple computers, but if that would make sense in your situation, you would know it already, I'm sure.\nSo all you need is a network connection between the computers, with ssh access.\nYour Fortran programs etc will not run \"better\", but they can run two times in parallel. If you really want to make use of both computers in some combined way from your programs, you need to add support for that to them. \nIn this case, you would need the technical infrastructure you asked about - but that is not a problem:\nIt's typically just a bunch of libraries and control programs that need to be installed on both computers.\nFor example, you could use MPI.\n", "Q: SQUID Proxy \"The request or reply is too large\" When I am using squid proxy in the server, I get an error message, \"The request or reply is too large\" from any node in the LAN.\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: This error message appears when you try downloading large file using GET or uploading it using POST/PUT.

This was recorded on boot, when just Chrome and calculator were running.\nThanks in advance.             \n\nA: In the UNIX world, developers sometimes use the term to refer to a program process that has died but hasn't yet given its process table entry back to the system.\nWhen a process finishes execution, it will have an exit status to report to its parent process. Because of this last little bit of information, the process will remain in the operating system’s process table as a zombie process, indicating that it is not to be scheduled for further execution, but that it cannot be completely removed (and its process ID cannot be reused) until it has been determined that the exit status is no longer needed.\nWhen a child exits, the parent process will receive a SIGCHLD signal to indicate that one of its children has finished executing; the parent process will typically call the wait() system call at this point. That call will provide the parent with the child’s exit status, and will cause the child to be reaped, or removed from the process table.\nThe idea behind keeping a zombie process is to keep the appropriate data structures about the termination of the process in case the parent ever gets interested via a wait.\nYou cannot kill zombies, as they are already dead. But if you have too many zombies then kill parent process or restart service.\nYou can kill zombie process using PID obtained from any one of the above command. \nkill -9 <PID_Number>\n\nSource:Mel Kham\n", "Q: Ubuntu For Smartphones Is there any way i can install ubuntu on my smartphone.\nMy phone is Samsung wave 3 GT-S8600\nIt is Bada 2.0 OS\nIt's firmware is S8600DDLD1/s8600ODDLD1 (INU)\n\nA: The minimum requirements to install Ubuntu in a phone is it should have Minimum 512 MB RAM and processor should be minimum 1Gz .\nas I have seen your mobile having 1.4 GHz Processor & 512MB of RAM. so it's fine.\nread this for more information https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install\n\nA: The list of currently supported devices can be found here...\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices\nUnfortunately your device isn't supported but this may change in the future.\n", "Q: Brasero stuck at 'Normalizing tracks' I am trying to burn an audio CD using Brasero.

I have searched around, including in askubuntu and all answers I found do not work.\nI have a file named .Xmodmap in my home folder which contains the desired mappings. If I run it manually it works fine, so there is no error there. In order to make it run on startup, I have tried:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Using various .xinitrc containing one of the following commands:   \n\n\n*\n\n*xmodmap .Xmodmap\n\n*xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap  \n\n*/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/NAME/.Xmodmap\n\n*if [ -s ~/.Xmodmap ]; then\nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\nfi\n\n\n*Using .Xresources instead of .xinitrc with the same variations.\n\n*Setting it as a startup application.\nNone of the above works in Ubuntu 13.04 (64-bit).

Apparently, Ubuntu is not able to configure the keyboard right away after logging in, but it is a bit later. So if you add a command\nsleep 4 && xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap &\n\nto ~/.bash_profile then it should work (it does for me).\nEDIT: This seems to work only after logging in, not after starting up. I'll have to investigate this later.\n\nA: Convert Caps Lock into Esc for vim use\nHere is my variant of a key mapping startup script. It converts Caps Lock into Esc on whatever keyboard for use with vi, vim or gvim.\nUnlike the answer of q4w56, this answer does not use any infinite while; do loop. Otherwise, one core of my dual core CPU would hit 42% every 5 seconds, severely reducing my laptop battery charge.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nsleep 4\nxmodmap -e \"clear Lock\"\nxmodmap -e \"keysym Caps_Lock = Escape\"\n\nSave it as a script. Make the file executable with chmod +x.\nAdd the script name and location to Session and Startup → Application Autostart (in Xubuntu).\nThe keyboard behaviour for this user will remain persistent through reboot and logout, but not suspend. Persistence through suspend can be achieved, but unfortunately only at the system level, not readily at the user level.\nEDIT\nI moved away from above solution in favour of this solution which offers, apart from the Esc function on CapsLock, also the arrow keys ←↓↑→ and the keys PgUpHomeEndPgDn through CapsLock+HJKL, respectively CapsLock+UIOP.\nRationale for this keyboard remapping\nIn today's computing world there is very little use left for the Caps Lock key. In general, one should refrain from using ALL CAPS by virtue of both netiquette and the separation of presentation and content. Moreover, accidentally hitting the Caps Lock key whilst editing text with vim is not always immediately noted, but invariably results in rather annoying vim behaviour further on. Disabling the Caps Lock key all together and repurposing it as an easy to reach Esc key results in a double win for vim use.\n\nA: @Daniel's answer pointed me the right way, but I would like to extend on it. \nWorks for me on Linux Mint 17.2 and Ubuntu 16.04.\nI tried all twists I could think of to keep using xmodmap, but they all fail when the system goes into sleep mode. The same even holds for start up-applicication scripts that use setxkbmap in cases where the *settings-daemon (for me it is xfce4) runs later than the script --- and order cannot really be influenced.\nWhat I finally came up with has the following ingredients:\n1) Write a minimal keyboard mapping file for /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols. Lets call the file mylayout It can be as simple as\nxkb_symbols \"basic\" {\n  name[Group1] = \"My Layout\";\n  include \"us\"\n  key <AE03> { [ 3, numbersign, sterling, sterling] };\n  include \"level3(ralt_switch)\"\n}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*basic is just a name, we'll meet it later again. \n\n*The name[Group1] similarly is just a name it seems, but it will play no role later.\n\n*include \"us\" includes the plain us keyboard. Actually us is another file in the same directory. This is the keyboard layout we are adapting. Choose a different one as needed. Note: no semicolon to end this line.\n\n*The key line is one adaptation of the keyboard, more can follow. The <AE03> can be found in the files under /usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes. Use the xev program to figure out that the \"3\"-key has keycode 12 and in the keycodes file Xfree86 it is mapped to <AE03>.\n\n*Finally another include directive to activate another keyboard option, in this case I want to have the right Alt-key to be the level-3 shift key, i.e. the key which gives access to the sterling sign I defined above. level3 is just a file name in the same folder with ralt_switch one section of it. Have a look around and choose what you need to include.\n\n\n2) I did not put the mylayout into the system folder. Rather I made only a soft link from the system folder to a folder of my liking to immediately see that this is not stock software.\n3) Further I did not fix up evdev.xml, again to prevent update hassles. But this would be necessary to find mylayout in the keyboard configuration editor (for xfce4 it is xfce4-keyboard-settings). Instead I used xfce4-settings-editor and changed keyboard-layout->XkbLayout to mylayout (the file name) and XkbVariant to basic (see above). Afterwards, mylayout/basic is displayed in the keyboard settings editor too. An entry in evdev.xml seems to be only necessary to be able to select the layout.\nThis way, the keyboard settings now survive sleep mode and reboot.\nMore background can be found here: http://www.charvolant.org/~doug/xkb/html/node5.html .\nAnother approach to fixing the sleep mode problem (not tried myself), can be found here: https://www.vinc17.net/unix/xkb.en.html .\nUPDATE: worked with Mint 18.3 the same moment I changed the settings in xfce4-settings-editor as described above.\nUPDATE: With 18.04, gdm3 as the display manager and XFCE4 as the window manager, it looks as if ~/.Xmodmap is read again and the settings seem to survive a suspend. (I rarely use suspend and I am never sure which mode the laptop is in then really.)\n\nA: I had the problem too on Ubuntu 16.04 with fcitx, and had the solution on the fcitx wiki, but it need fcitx has 4.2.7 or later\n\n\n*\n\n*touch ~/.Xmodmap\n\n*write the config\n\n*reboot and the fcitx will try to load it automatically\n\n\nThere also have some explanation for the reason.\n\nA: REVISION\nAn update in early 2018 broke persistence -- auto-reload  of the keymap after suspend or hibernate. Since methods using /etc/pm/sleep.d scripts stopped working (deprecated?), that left only the newer way, using /lib/systemd/system-sleep and slightly different scripting (which started working on keymaps!).\nSo this post is updated to the newer method for persistence, and to include normal initial keymap loading, which also started working. The routine for converting an .Xmodmap file to .xkbmap remains unchanged.\nNote this is a per-user solution. For a per-device answer, see how to apply a keymap to a single device. This method could be adapted for use here.\nFirst modify the .Xmodmap file as desired. These are easier to edit directly than .xkbmap files. When it is loaded:\n\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\nthen convert to an .xkb file:\n\nxkbcomp $DISPLAY $HOME/.xkbmap\n\nTo auto-load on startup, open Startup Applications, click Add, and on the Command line enter:\n\nxkbcomp /home/user/.xkbmap \":0\"\n\n(\"user\" is replaced with actual user name.) For Name, perhaps enter Load Keyboard Map. Add comment if desired and hit Save. \nThe keymap will now load every time the system boots, but will not survive a suspend or hibernate. For this, create a new file in /lib/systemd/system-sleep, perhaps named 60_xkbmap, which contains:\n#!/bin/sh\ncase $1/$2 in\n  pre/*)\n    # Place pre-suspend commands here\n    exit 0\n    ;;\n  post/*)\n    # Place post-suspend commands here\n    export DISPLAY=\":0\"\n    export XAUTHORITY=\"/home/user/.Xauthority\"\n    su user -c \"xkbcomp /home/user/.xkb/xkb-map $DISPLAY 2>/dev/null\"\n    ;;\nesac\n\n(Ref.) As above, replace \"user\" with actual user name.\nThe keymap should now auto-load and remain persistent. Note:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applies to current LTS release, 16.04, and likely later ones as well.\n\n*Taken from post 14 of the above-linked bug thread.\n\n*Earlier comments applied to original post.\n\n\nA: For me, the xkb configuration is too complicated if you want to remap 1 or 2 keys in a way not available in the System Settings. Plus, the solution should remain on the user side, without editing '/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/' etc. Force the 'xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap' load using the Startup Applications only works until you suspend, change users or change the keyboard layout. So, as holocronweaver suggests, with code snippets I found, I made a python script to be loaded on session startup, that reloads the '~/.Xmodmap' when needed.\nCheck the bug report #1243642 (comment #6), and download it here. \n\nA: Steps mentioned in the accepted answer(also described here) is a persistent solution, but didn't work for me in case of altering alphabetical keys.\nIf you got frustrated by trying other options or want to save your time, try the steps mentioned in the article - https://medium.com/@saplos123456/persistent-keyboard-mapping-on-ubuntu-using-xmodmap-cd01ad828fcd\n\n*\n\n*Make a new copy of xmodmap.\n\nxmodmap -pke > .Xmodmap\n\n\n\n*Edit the new file using the following command and change keycode(s) as per your requirements.\n\ngedit .Xmodmap\n\n\n\n*Activate those changes. New changes should reflect after this.\n\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\n\n\n*Skippable step - Generate xkb file with new mapping\n\nxkbcomp $DISPLAY $HOME/.xkbmap\n\n\n\n*All above changes are temporary and would be replaced on reboot. Create a start-up program to trigger the following command\n\nxkbcomp /home/user/.xkbmap \":0\"   // if you followed the 4th step\nOR\nxmodmap .Xmodmap    // if you skipped the 4th step\n\n\nA: Ubuntu no longer uses xmodmap, but instead uses xkb (as far as I understand, this facilitates per-window keyboard layouts, among other things).\nThe system-wide map files are in\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/\n\nThe maps appears to be loaded hierarchically, with the pc map as the root, and whatever language (e.g. en) as a child of the root.\nIn my particular case, I physically swapped Page Up with Home and Page Down with End on my keyboard, so I very crudely made changes to the system-wide pc map, as follows:\n key <HOME> {    [  Prior        ]   };\n key <PGUP> {    [  Home         ]   };\n key  <END> {    [  Next         ]   };\n key <PGDN> {    [  End          ]   };\n\nNOTE: To force Xorg to use your new keyboard map, you may have to remove the existing pre-compiled maps (*.xkm) in\n/var/lib/xkb/\n\nand then restart Xorg.\nThere are various resources on xkb, but this one is related to Ubuntu.\n\nA: This made me stumble, too, when I upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 13.04.\nLuckily this setting is now (or perhaps has always been) easily accessible in the Keyboard preferences and can be changed with a few clicks of the mouse.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings > Keyboard Layout > Options...\n\n*In the Keyboard Layout Options, click the arrow to reveal the ▸ Ctrl key position options.\n\n*Put the checkmark in at Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock.\n\n\nThere you go: Left Control and Caps Lock have switched positions.\nDon't forget to delete ~/.Xmodmap once you've made the change.\n\nA: I find adding this script to startup satisfying: \nwhile true;do \n    xmodmap -e \"keycode 87=Prior\"\n    xmodmap -e \"keycode 88=Next\"\n    sleep 5\ndone\n\nI tried using xmodmap ./Xmodmap, but every time it is executed, a noticeable lag will occur.\n\nA: Most of the other solutions load xmodmap on session startup (or earlier), but then your settings get wiped when you plug a new keyboard (or switch your KVM switch).

We all know that SSDs have a limited predetermined life span. \nSo the question for me is how do I check in (Ubuntu) Linux what the current health status of my SSD is? And maybe an estimation how long it will take?\nGraphical tool is preferred, but command line tool would also be fine.\nI'm using Xubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\nA: to check the health of a SSD\nFor Ubuntu, Mint, or Debian based distributions\n# apt-get install smartmontools\n\nThe Media_Wearout_Indicator is what you are looking for. For 100 means your ssd has 100% life, the lower number means less life left.\n# smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep Media_Wearout_Indicator\n\nTo show your sdd information\n# smartctl -a /dev/sda\n\nYou can read the complete article at Nam Huy Linux Blog - How to check SSD life left on linux\n\nA: Wear_Leveling_Count is the right attribute to track.  However, like the other attributes, 100 is the BEST value and 0 is the WORST.  Think of it as \"percent life remaining\".\n\nA: Install Gnome Disk Utility and check SMART Data and Tests for wear-leveling-count or similar. The higher that number (%, from 1 to 100), the more \"used up\" your SSD is, which means you are more likely to have problems. But if you have a recent SSD, you need not worry about it.\nInstalled via\n sudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility\n\nstart it via\neither menu->Settings->Disk utility\nor via command line\nsudo gnome-disks\n\n\nA: If you don't have an Intel-brand SSD: READ THIS.\nWatch out !!    -- I was blithely mislead by 'smartmontools.'  I have a Samsung SSD, and the smartmonitor/'smartctl' tool happily misreported that '233' (hex 'E9') attribute was 'Media_Wearout_Indicator'; in fact -- no, for Samsung (and other manufacturers) it is up to entirely different. This and other forum postings, stack-exchange question/answers, and power-user blogs I found seem to be 'Intel focused,' with only vague hints that 'it may vary.' (Versus any suggestion that you need to watch out for wrong and erroneous labeling of the attribute by smartmontools).\nAs I was preparing to copy my SSD to a new harddrive I'd bought (because of what smartmontools had told me), I booted to windows (I have a dual boot system), to learn something about SSD's from what the windows-only Samsung tool 'Samsung_Magician_v43.exe'  had to tell me about my drive -- it was shockingly uninformative.\nAfter what's been hours of digging - I've finally been able to run the windows only tools: hddgaurdian, and then also CrystalDiskInfo:   Surprise! both tools independently tell me my Samsung SSD is 'just fine'  (hdd guardian says '5 stars' and Crystal Disk \"98% OK\"). By contrast the smartctl tool explicitly labeled the attribute with 'decimal- 233  /  'hex-  E9'  as \"Media Wearout Indicator\"   -- and told me its value was \"1\" or 1% -- an indicator of (the risk of) pending failure. To be as sure as I can, I dug and dug and was finally able to locate at least something from Samsung official: Samsung White Paper 07: Communicating With Your SSD [archive.org]\nThe document indeed implies that the attribute 'hex E9' /'decimal '233' is not used by Samsung the same way.  ( Samsung: I'm very disappointed, please either fix your official software-tool, or at least make it clear that you do not provide wear out indication information!)\nFurther -  if you have neither an Intel SSD nor Samsung SSD - be warned, this info does seem to vary across manufacturers.   ( e.g. see the attribute label chart on https://code.google.com/p/hddguardian/wiki/about_reliability for the only useful indication of the degree of variability that I found. )\nThe so-what: If you don't have an Intel SSD-- do not  be mislead by the false attribute name labels provided by smartmonitor. Perhaps it will improve in the future, but the version installed by default for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (April, 2014) was total fail. Instead of telling you it 'doesn't know' -- smartctl just mislabeled the attribute.  I did not find another tool for linux that made the 'correct' information transparent or clear.\n\nA: The best way to check the health of an SSD is to follow the manufacturers recommendations for doing so. As these vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and may change over time, it's a good idea to check with your drives manufacturer if you have concerns. Based on MTBF ratings (the JEDEC JESD218A standard defines the method) provided by most manufacturers an SSD should last well over a million hours without a problem. \nI have several of these covering several manufacturers. I can guarantee that the SMART attributes vary between manufacturers. For comparison purposes here's an example from OCZ and smart data from a Corsair F40 unit along with a discussion regarding how unreliable this data is.\nWhile SMART data can certainly have value, since all devices fail eventually, the important thing is that you back up your data regularly. This provides peace of mind that your data is safe while you wait (likely for several years) for your SSD to fail. As costs drop and capacities rise, it's more likely that you'll replace an SSD due to space contraints than to failure. (In my experience 10x more likely). I would simply backup regularly and not worry about it. \nSources:\nExperience, http://www.hardcoreware.net/mtbf-ssd-what-does-it-mean-for-you/\n\nA: For (at least some) NVMe drives, you can do\nsmartctl -a /dev/nvme0\n\nYou can then look for a line like:\nPercentage Used:                    5%\n\nHere lower numbers are better and 100% means the drive is \"worn out\".  Manufacturer documentation suggests that it is possible to get numbers above 100% if you keep using the drive beyond this point (example from Seagate, see page 12).\nNote that if you use the namespace or partition devices, like /dev/nvme0n1 or /dev/nvme0n1p1, it won't work and you will instead get a message like Read NVMe SMART/Health Information failed: NVMe Status 0x4002.\n\nA: For Kingston drives on Debian-based computers\nSimilar to this answer execute\n# apt-get install smartmontools\n\nHowever when I execute the command to show the drive info, it looks like SMART was disabled:\n# smartctl -a /dev/sda \nsmartctl 6.2 2013-07-26 r3841 [x86_64-linux-3.13.0-45-generic] (local build)\n[ ... ]\nSMART support is: Available - device has SMART capability.\nSMART support is: Disabled\n\nYou need to enable that by executing the following as root:\n# smartctl -s on -a /dev/sda\n\nYou can then execute a self-test by doing either a short test (which took me about 1 minute):\n# smartctl -t short -a /dev/sda\n\nor a more thorough test (which took me about 1.5 hours):\n# smartctl -t long -a /dev/sda\n\nNote, in most circumstances you do not need to unmount the drive to execute these tests. If you do, see man smartctl.\nNow, when you execute smartctl -a /dev/sda you should then see a self-assessment test result.

Infact I have 2 drives with the same name. Both FAT.\nI would like ideally which ever one is connected when the system boots to be mounted. Is this possible? Or does auto mount work on an identifier beyond the name?\n\nA: You can edit your /etc/fstab and add the following line to do this easily. But you may understand the risks of doing so.\nLABEL=flash /media/where_will_be_mounted vfat defaults 0 0\n\nOk, lets boil down each option:\n\n\n*\n\n*LABEL=flash: tells the system to mount any driver with the label flash\n\n*/media/where_will_be_mounted: Self-explanatory, you should already have the path created before mounting.\n\n*vfat: you said the filesystem will be FAT always, if it's not FAT it will fail.\n\n*defaults: This set up the driver with the default mount options for the filesystem, equivalent to rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async. The important part here is the auto, that tells the system to mount automatically the filesystem when mount -a is issued, like it does at boot.\n\n*0: They are dump and fscheck options, you most likely won't want this.\n\n\nA: My answer is simple - rename one of them.\nRemember that the UUID is very specific to that particular flash drive, so once you make that change in your system it will only work with that exact drive.  \nIf it fails then you would need to go through this whole process again.  \nIt makes a lot more sense for them to have separate names.  Software will have a simple time addressing them without any funny business.\nIf it needs to go to another computer with that name, then simply eject the other one and then rename it back so the other system will recognize it.\nAnd your primary system will always recognize the drive by name, whether natively or if you use pmount.  \nI would never alter my system internally just to support a fragile piece like a flash drive.\nIf you do it this way it will work even on a copy (or a restoration from a backup).\nThe only reason I can imagine for the UUID method is if you are in a highly secure environment where every flash drive is catalogued.\nIt just makes sense to build your processes to be fault-tolerant.  \n\nA: Connect both drives, open a terminal (maximize it) and run\nsudo blkid -olist\n\nTake note of the UUID of your flash drives. Now write a script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nfirst_uuid=<first-drive-uuid>\nsecond_uuid=<second-drive-uuid>\n\nudisks --mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/$first_uuid\nudisks --mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/$second_uuid\n\n(Substitute <first-drive-uuid> and <second-drive-uuid> with the UUID's of the drives.)\nMake the script executable, and add it to Startup Applications or to some initialization script.\n\nA: Create two directories flash1 flash2 wherever you want to mount the drive (e.g. ~/flash1)\nPerform the following steps for each drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert flash drive and determine the device name (e.g. /dev/sdb1)\n\n*run the command sudo blkid /dev/sdb1\n\n*Write down or copy the UUID somewhere.\n\n*sudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n*add the line: UUID=<uuidfordevice> ~/flash1 vfat defaults 0  0\nAnd Repeat with the other drive.\nYou might be able to just use one mount directory (flash) if you only ever have one in at a time, but I would have separate directories for each drive.\n", "Q: Drivers for gaming Nvidia and wine and what happened to wine tricks?

However, instead I get an error, I can't remember what it said but it wouldn't let me boot. \nI had to create another partition and install Ubuntu again, just to get grub back, which was a pain. \nA few days later I create another partition and install windows 7 on it, and during boot, grub was gone again, it would only boot from windows, even though I had Ubuntu installed on another partition. So, once again, I had to create a new partition and install Ubuntu just to get grub back.\nIs there any way to keep grub when creating and removing partitions? \n\nA: You could always mend your grub with Boot Repair. This is a really useful guide for those who need it or for if your grub vanishes due to loading another OS.\n\nA: As SimplySimon says, Boot Repair can sometimes fix things after the fact. To understand what's going on, though, there are two cases:\nBIOS\nOn a traditional BIOS-based computer, the firmware (the BIOS) reads the first sector of the hard disk (aka the Master Boot Record, or MBR) and executes the code it contains. Thus, whatever code is in the MBR controls the boot process of the computer. (Modern computers give limited control by enabling you to specify which hard disk to boot, but this is only useful on multi-disk computers.)\nIn order to make a computer bootable, an OS installer must be able to install a boot loader to the MBR. That said, some installers make this step optional, relying on the user to know when another boot loader is already installed. Microsoft has always made installation of a boot loader to the MBR non-optional, and Linux distributions aimed at less experienced users have been going this same route in recent years.\nThe end result of this is that the last OS you install is the one that will control the boot process, unless that last-installed OS gave expert-level control of boot loader installation. If this isn't what you wanted, boot loader re-installation is the only option. Ubuntu's Boot Repair tool helps to automate this task, but there are other ways to do it, too.\nEFI\nNewer computers use EFI firmware rather than a BIOS. (Confusingly, though, manufacturers and most users continue to use the term \"BIOS\" in reference to the EFI. This usage is technically incorrect, and IMHO it fosters confusing misunderstandings.) These computers store boot loaders as ordinary files on the EFI System Partition (ESP). You can store as many boot loaders as you like on the ESP. They're referred to in NVRAM entries created via Linux's efibootmgr or equivalents in other OSes.\nWhen an OS installs itself, it will typically register its boot loader and make it the default; but you can typically switch to another boot loader by hitting a function key during the boot process. Unfortunately, the key to press to manage the boot process is entirely non-standardized, and some computers are rude enough to not even activate the keyboard during the boot process, so it may be impossible to make such a change -- at least, not without altering some firmware settings.\nIn practice, therefore, the EFI behavior looks very much like the BIOS behavior: The last-installed OS's boot loader takes precedence. The difference is that the recovery method under EFI does not require re-installing the boot loader; it just requires using efibootmgr or some other tool to change the boot order. The Boot Repair utility will do this, but it also does a lot of other things, some of which are usually unnecessary and can be harmful in the long run. Thus, I'm not a big fan of Boot Repair on EFI-based computers. If you're lucky, your firmware will offer a way to permanently  adjust the boot order, but this capability is relatively rare.\n", "Q: SD Card vanished after placement of .nomedia file This is not really a Ubuntu problem but since I moved from Windows to Ubuntu I naturally would like to use Ubuntu to solve this problem. \nI bought a 32gb sandisk micro sd card for my galaxy note 2. Everyrhing worked fine and I started adding files to it. After a couple of files (music, pictures abd docs) were added I realized that many of them appeared in the gallery.  This became annoying because I did not want all of them to appear there. I usually use a .nomedia file placed in the folder I want to exclude to manage the media flood in the gallery.\nSince I put a whole lot of media onto the new sd card I thought it wont hurt if I place the .nomedia file directly in the root of the sd card. And so I did. Seconds later the sd card vanished from android altogether.\nPlugged it into the card reader on my windows laptop. A removable disk appears in the file tree but when I clicked on it it only told me to please add some media into drive.\nUbuntu it doesnt even show at all. If I plug in anothervsd card it pops up fine.\nSo I tried finding it. I plugged it back the card reader on my machine running ubuntu and typed sudo fdisk -l. It listed it once as dev/sdb I tried mounting it into media/sdcard\nBut for whatever reason my laptop hung itself shortly afterwards.\nNow when I type fdisk -l the disk doesn't even appear anymore.\nPLease someone help me out here.\nDon't care about the data on the card but would like to use the card again.

So I tried to use rm -rf XXX and also Shift + Delete to remove but both failed because of the same error.\nI was able to delete the directory by right clicking the directory, choosing Move to Trash and then Empty Trash.\n\nA: If it is an NTFS or FAT file system and you don't have access to Windows just copy the files that you want to keep from the USB drive onto your hard drive. Then format the USB drive again using GPARTED or similar partition manager to NTFS or FAT. Followed by copying all the files back onto the USB drive.

I have been trying to boot straight into windows but to no avail.\nAnyway, I have tried installing ubuntu 12.04lts with the windows installer 3 times and all 3 times my machine would just freeze at the ubuntu log in. When I force shut down and restart it says that grub cannot be found. \nCan someone please help....\n\nA: Use liveCD , 'try ubuntu' mode go and check your GParted ;)\nIf your want just overwrite everything and install fresh version of Ubuntu - just delete everything and use GUI installer - easy \nor\nprintout here 'df -l' ( from terminal )\n", "Q: Screen resolution problems on Samsung monitor I have a monitor Samsung 19' which resolution is 1440x900 (16:10 aspect ratio). When I set it in the recently installed Ubuntu 13.04, the bottom of the screen gets cut out\nTrying to change to another resolution in which I would be able to view all the screen, I found that 1280x960 (4:3) worked. The screen looks stretched and low resolution, though.\nHow do I fix it? Consider in your answer that I'm a noob.\n\nA: (1) Before you use xrandr, use cvt to generate a Modeline with your desired resolution and frequency.  For example...\n$ cvt 1280 1024 60.09\n\nThe result will be something like...\n# 1280x1024 60.03 Hz (CVT) hsync: 63.81 kHz; pclk: 109.25 MHz\nModeline \"1280x1024_60.09\"  109.25  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\n\n(2) Now, this is the new mode you should create using xrandr...\nxrandr --newmode \"1280x1024_60.09\"  109.25  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\n\n(3) Then add your new mode using xrandr...\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1280x1024_60.09\n\n(4) Finally, test it...\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024_60.09\n\n(Make sure the output display device, such as VGA1, is your correct device as shown in Ubuntu Display Settings).\n\nA: Read the post from the link. Before starting using those commands, use the command \"xrandr\" that will show \"DP1\" or \"VGA1\" or \"etc\" connected. Use that \"etc\" instead of that \"DP1\" from this link. See if it works.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2161010&p=12729210#post12729210\nPS: In the begining of this thread is another link that goes to another thread more explicitely.

I do a job in which I need TFTP and DHCP server.\nThe DHCP settings I should adjust is (I have DHCP and DHCP 3, not sure where to set):\n    default-lease-time 21600;\n    max-lease-time 43200;\n    option domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1;\n    option netbios-name-servers 10.0.0.1;\n    option netbios-node-type 8;\n    option www-server 10.0.0.1;\n    authoritative;\n    allow booting;\n    allow bootp;\n\n    subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0\n    {\n    option routers 10.0.0.1;\n    option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\n    option broadcast-address 10.0.0.255;\n    filename \"/tftpboot/newsistemgeminis\";\n    range 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.100;\n    }\n\nI have to copy ''newsistemgeminis'' kernel image to the /tftpboot/.\nFor the TFTP server should edit /etc/inetd.conf and set the server directory to \n/tftpboot/ but this file is empty :/\nI installed the following packages: dhcpd, tftp, tftpd-hpa, isc-dhcp-server\nNow, start TFTP and DHCP, but I have these problems:\nroot@ubuntu:/home/ubuntu# invoke-rc.d dhcp start\n invoke-rc.d: unknown initscript, /etc/init.d/dhcp not found.\n\nI do not understand what happens, for more I seek not solve the problem, could someone please help me? I'll be very grateful, thanks and greetings.\n\nA: You shouldn't need to edit the /etc/inetd.conf file if you're going to use the default /var/lib/tftpboot/ path. TFTP will default to this path already.\nTypically the lines in your dhcpd.conf should be something like\nnext-server (ip address of tftp server); #this is if your tftp sever is separate from your DHCP server\nfilename \"pxelinux.0\";\n\npxelinux.0 will typically point to a boot image in pxelinux.conf for the machine you're trying to boot.\nFor a completely overblown example of how this is put into practice, you can check out something like Foreman, MAAS, or any other orchestration tool.\n", "Q: Wireshark Troubles I'm only able to watch my own data through a network and nothing else. I have no clue what to do anymore after trying a lot of different things. Im running Ubuntu 13.04 on VMWare. \n\nA: Perhaps, allowing promiscuous mode of the virtual LAN adapater and not using NAT (also in the VM settings) could help.\n", "Q: GRUB failed to install during boot-repair I get ^ that error after doing the steps told by Boot-Repair (after installing Ubuntu, I never got the option to boot it - it only let me \"Try Ubuntu\" or \"Install Ubuntu\").\nWhat does this mean?\n\n\nA: There can be several reasons, can review which may apply.\nLocked BIOS or security (may be called Boot sector virus protection)  in BIOS prevents writing to MBR.\nSimilarly for UEFI, some have a defective efi partition that will not write to.\nAlso if you have RAID or Intel SRT, or created partitions with Windows and converted to dynamic partitions which do not work with Linux or you installed Windows in MBR mode to a drive that was previously gpt and you have left over gpt meta-data.\n", "Q: How do I remove an alias? I want to remove gs alias from my PC. When I type gs it will open GhostScript. But I checked everywhere in the home directory .alias .bash_aliases .bashrc\nI also overwrite the gs with my custom alias. \nI can't remove it. And I also type alias in terminal, in the list I couldn't find it. \nPlease I want to remove it... \n\nA: TL;DR: The command to remove a shell alias is unalias. See the unalias manual. Run:\nunalias gs\n\nBut if your gs command is not an alias (most likely), it will not help. The response will be something like:\n\nbash: unalias: gs: not found\n\nTo find the type of the command trouble you're in, use type built-in shell command:\ntype gs\n\nOn my system it says it is an executable:\n\ngs is /usr/bin/gs\n\nCompare that with a common alias ll:\nalias ll='ls -l'\ntype ll\n\n\nll is aliased to `ls -l'\n\nSee help type for detailed description of the type shell built-in command\nYou can also check if it is a symbolic link with:\nls -la /usr/bin/gs\n\nOn my system it isn't:\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 14520 Aug 24 17:03 /usr/bin/gs\n\nOtherwise there would be an arrow like this:\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 14520 Aug 24 17:03 /usr/bin/gs -> /some/other/file\n\nAs pointed out by others, removing the alias from the current shell session is temporary. For permanent removal, you will need to find where it is defined, such as alias gs=xyz, and remove it there, or add unalias gs to your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file.\nIf it is not an alias, you can locate the package that installed the command and uninstall it. On Debian/Ubuntu for instance:\ndpkg -S /usr/bin/gs\n\n\nghostscript: /usr/bin/gs\n\nsudo apt-get remove ghostscript\n\n\nA: The command to remove an alias is unalias so....\n unalias gs\n\nManual:\nNAME \n\nunalias - remove alias definitions\n\nSYNOPSIS\nunalias alias-name...\n\nunalias -a\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe  unalias  utility  shall  remove the definition for each alias name\n         specified. See Alias Substitution . The aliases shall be  removed  from\n         the   current   shell   execution   environment;  see  Shell  Execution\n         Environment .\n-a   Removes All aliases\n\n\nA: If unalias is not working, as is currently the case with fish-shell (refer to this issue #7132 from fish-shell github page for more details), you can use functions with -e (erase functions) to erase the alias.\nfunctions -e [alias name]\n\n", "Q: Where is GParted located in USB installation file? I want to install Ubuntu on my Laptop that already has Windows 7 Home Premium. I have the .ISO image of Ubuntu 12.04.1 which I have burned to USB.  I have successfully booted using USB drive. \nI have gone through some tutorials which tells how to install Ubuntu to new partition. Some of these websites recommend using GParted to shrink partition etc. However, I could not find any icon to GParted on the desktop. I tried \"System Setting\" link but there also I could not find it.\nCould anyone help me understand where is GParted located and how do I run it? Please note that I do not have prior experience in Linux/Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you have a working, installed, Ubuntu you need to install it with\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nIf you have an installation Live DVD and boot from it choose \"install Ubuntu\" and at some point you reach a \"partitioning\" section during the installation. That is gParted.\nWhat you might want is the gParted Live: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php Works the same as the Ubuntu Live: burn the ISO, start system with DVD/CD and it will run gParted. It is a good tool for changing your disc without the need for a working operating system. So always handy.\n\nA: GParted preinstalled on Ubuntu liveCD.  If not, you can install gparted.\nTo do so, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\nA: It is better to shrink Windows with Windows tools and use gparted to create partitions if you want to create in advance. Or you can use installer to create partitions. Reboot Windows after shrink so it can run its chkdsk and repairs to recognize its new size.\nYou may have the 4 primary partition limit and need to backup and delete one partition. Usually the best one to delete is the vendor tools, but do not delete the hidden 100MB boot or main Windows install.\nIf you click on the Ubuntu icon at the top of the Launcher on the left side, you can open dash and type in gparted.\nhttp://castrojo.tumblr.com/post/4795149014/the-power-users-guide-to-unity\n", "Q: authentication password required to download ubuntu application I m using a wifi connection but when i m trying to download Ubuntu app from app store it is asking for some authentication password,i m also unable play downloaded video it asks for plugin\n\nA: The Software Center is asking for your administrative password (the one you use to log into Ubuntu), this for security reasons.\nFor the video you can install VLC, which will (usually) pull the required packages.\n", "Q: extracting install iso to a partion I currently have ubuntu 12.04 installed and I am ready to upgrade. I would like to do a \"clean install\" for various reasons. When I installed 12.04 I had extracted the iso to a 1GB \"installer\" partion on my hard disk and I would like to do the same thing now, but I can no longer find instructions on how to do this. I thought I could use the usb creator tools (either usb-creator-gtk or unetbootin) but it seems neither of these will write the install files to a local partion. I honestly can't remember but I may have used dd to write the image to the partition but given the low-level nature of what's going on I'd like to ask before typing these things in the terminal. I believe I can do it as follows\ndd bs=4096 if=/home/user/downloads/ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sda6 conv=notrunc,noerror\n\nI have verified that sda6 is in fact the partition I wish to extract to by looking at the drive labels in gparted. \nI like having the installer iso on a partition that grub can find so that when I run into problems I always have a \"spare\" system on hand that I can boot into and mess around with config files. However I hate having to burn isos to dvd or dig through my ten cheapo usb sticks to find the one that actually works with a bootloader on it. I also like the fact that update-grub can find that partition and add it to the boot menu, so that if I do something to make my main system unbootable I just down-arrow to the installer menu item from grub and have a nice desktop from which I can fix things, or, in the worst case, just start over with a clean install (/home is a separate partition, so I dont really lose anything this way). \nSo my question, is basically just: is this the right command? \n\nA: If you have grub on your hard drive or on a flash drive, you can directly boot the ISO using grub2's loopmount. Works for Ubuntu desktop and many other Linux but not all ISO. \nI used to copy ISO to flash drive and boot ISO as then I can have more than one (several repair type Linux ISO) on my somewhat larger 4GB flash drives. But I also have the install ISO on my hard drive.\nThis will boot an ISO from a hard drive.\nISO Booting with Grub 2 from Hard drive - drs305\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot\nExamples - you may copy & edit for your path & ISO version\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot/Examples\nIf you have multiple drives or a flash drive, numbering of drive can be an issue. The drive you boot from is always hd0 in grub. Then they may be numbered in port order or how BIOS loads drives. \nI also have nVidia and have to add nomodeset boot parameter to get an ISO to boot. Some versions of Ubuntu use vmlinuz.efi even if not UEFI booting and others just use vmlinuz. I just recently copied my Ubuntu boot stanza to boot Xubuntu and Ubuntu had the .efi and Xubuntu did not and it took me a couple of tries and opening ISO to see what it used to realize the difference.\n", "Q: Can't use Windows after installing Ubuntu I have Windows on my machine and then I installed Ubuntu 12.04 using a CD.

Having been a long time windows user I'm used to being baby sat through things I want to do haha. Anyway on to my question.\nI currently run wine to play a lot of my favourite games, so far I've been lucky and not run into any issues at all. I have a few niggles but nothing I can't fix myself except for this one. I want to play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. The game runs beautifully with the exception of a sound problem. I went to the wine hq page and read through some solutions to the same problem that a lot of people seem to be having. The bug is here: \nhttp://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14896\nSomeone wrote a custom patch to fix this issue. I asked someone how I would go about installing the custom patch that would fix this problem, and I was linked to a page with instructions that just made my head spin!\nI really can't make sense of a lot of it. Because as I stated, I'm still quite new to linux. I'm getting better with linux but there's still a lot I need to learn. If anyone would be willing to either point me to some more simplified instructions on how to accomplish this or write some out for me, I would forever be in your debt!\nIn case it's of any relevance, im running Ubuntu 13.04 64bit\nWine version 1.4.1\n\nA: When applications are written, they are simply a large group of text files called the source code that developers have typed out in whatever programming language they have chosen to write the program in. To actually run the program, these files need to be compiled using a software program called a \"compiler\" into binaries. Binaries are the files that are computer-readable, and when programs are distributed or downloaded through the Software Center they are the compiled and packaged versions of the program.\nSoftware patches are files that describe changes to be made to the source code. patch is the name of the program used to patch source code. To patch software, you download (or create) a patch file and use the patch program on the patch file to patch the source code (confusing!). \nThis takes a long time for big programs like Wine, but it can be done. In your situation, you will need to remove the Wine package you have installed, download and extract the Wine source code (making sure it is roughly the same software version), apply the patch, and then compile and install the patched source code. This will be easily accomplished using the terminal with tools provided by the apt software management suite. You can open the Terminal from the dash or with ctrl - alt - T.\nAfter you open the Terminal, remove the packaged version of Wine that you got from the software center along with all of the other packages it relies on, and all of their configuration files with the command below, which you can copy and paste. This will not remove all of the Wine programs, like GTA, that you have installed.\nsudo apt-get -y purge wine && sudo apt-get -y --purge autoremove\n\nThis and every other command that starts with \"sudo\" will require that you type in your password, which will not appear, and then press [Enter]. It provides programs with administrator/root priveleges. When this finishes and you are at a prompt (denoted with the $ symbol) again, create a new folder and move into it. This will create a folder called \"wine\" in your Downloads folder. I don't know if you want all of this going into your Downloads folder, but you can modify it to taste - just don't delete the folder!\nmkdir ~/Downloads/Wine\ncd ~/Downloads/Wine\n\nNext, download the source code for Wine from the Ubuntu repositories, and cd to the Wine source tree.\nsudo apt-get -y build-dep wine1.4\napt-get source wine\ncd wine1.4-1.4.1/\n\nA long list of packages will be installed and the source code will be downloaded and checked (you can ignore any warnings). When finished, download and apply the patch so that your game will work correctly. The echo command combined with the use of >> will add a newline to the end of the patch file - which Dropbox stripped - so that the patch command will not complain. The apt-get commands install the wget program, which is a command line tool for downloading files from the web.\nsudo apt-get -y install wget\nwget https://www.dropbox.com/s/0c9e1qjurpjxi3m/patchfile1.patch\npatch -p1 < patchfile1.patch\ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b\n\nIt would be advisable to go get a coffee, or two, or three at this point, because it will take a loooooooonnnnnnnnnnngggg time to compile Wine!\nOnce that is all finished and you see the $ again, change one directory up and install the packaged version of the freshly compiled source code.\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nHope it works!\n", "Q: Grub Cannot load Ubuntu My computer refused load Ubuntu and instead gave me grub. When I typed boot, it said you need to load the kernel first. I saw some other stuff on grub so I have tried find /boot/grub/stage1 but it gives me an error (can't find command 'find').\nIf it matters, I believe this error was caused by a startup repair from Windows (which I think affects the disk) so if anyone can help me.\n\nA: Running a Windows Startup Repair is definitely quite risky on Linux systems. You can mess up any number of things including the MBR and boot sector.\nFortunately, there is a tool out there designed to easily recover from this type of issue called Boot-repair. All you need is an Ubuntu Live CD or USB and an internet connection. See the Boot-repair guide in the Ubuntu Community Documentation to see how to install the tool in a live environment, and then just do a Recommended Repair. If you run into further issues, it will create a Boot Info Script link which you can paste back here.\n", "Q: Why do I get LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS when trying to get my Xbox controller working?

However, I have only got this working for one controller so far.\n\nA: The libusb permissions are not set for you, you would have to go into user and group settings to change it or use sudo. But even then depending on what version of chrubuntu you installed you still might be out of luck, because I use 12.4 on the c7 parrot and the kernel module uinput, isn't installed. and is required for xboxdrv.\n\nA: As I see from the output, you have Xbox Elite. Its support was first written in the end of 2015 year by SteamOS devs, and added to Linux kernel 4.7 (not yet released for writing these words) just 28 May 2016. See this for details. So, the easiest way to get the support is to install Linux-4.7 (e.g. from a PPA after it released).\nThe ones to blame are the company released the gamepad. Instead of using the standard for gamepads as everyone does, they decided to reinvent the wheel, and created their own, incompatible with the World, protocol.\nThe Microsoft's — the manufacturer company — support for their own gamepad is, actually, so bad, that there's rumor it isn't even supported on their own OSes, except Windows 10 (I'm saying «rumor» just because I have neither Windows, nor this gamepad to check this out).

Instead you should consider installing Ubuntu GNOME if your computer hardware is compatible with the Ubuntu GNOME system requirements. According to the Ubuntu GNOME wiki:\n\"System Requirements\nIt is recommended to have at least 1 GB of RAM or more (we shall soon do re-assessment for further specific details). If you have an old machine, you may consider other alternatives like Lubuntu.\" \nIf the reason why you want to install gnome-shell in Lubuntu is to have an interface customized for netbooks, you should consider installing the lxlauncher package from the default Ubuntu repositories.

I used it for a few months (with no problems using wired or wireless networking) and then decided to gut the OS and replace it with Ubuntu Desktop 12.04.

All of the sudden, wireless was disabled on my machine, and as such, I couldn't find any of the wireless networks I was used to using.\nLast week, a co-worker recommended trying sudo modprobe wl because he thought it might be my Broadcom wifi drivers; I gave it a try and it works. So now, in order to have wifi, I need to run sudo modprobe wl.\nWhy (specifically)? Are these drivers not supported in the Ubuntu repositories for some reason?\n\nA: The module is present on your OS (seeing as how modprobe loads it), but it appears to not load on boot, could be due to an upgrade or something like that.\nEither way, first check if the specific module is blacklisted in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist, if so, comment out the line containing it (just add a # at the beginning of it).\nIf it's not blacklisted and still fails to load on boot, add the module to /etc/modules\n", "Q: Where do Broadcom wireless drivers log?

You’ll need to download and install and follow the instructions.\nVisit this link for more appropriate tutorial. -> http://teen-geeks.blogspot.in/2013/07/how-to-make-ubuntu-live-thumbdrive.html\n1) Install this software -> http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\n2) Click 'Browse' and open the ISO file you downloaded.\n3) Choose the USB drive and click 'Create'.\nNow connect the created USB drive while you reboot. You may have to configure Boot Device Order from BIOS setup. How to do this ? Follow the below instructions.\n1) While you are booting your PC or Laptop, press del key (depends on different computers. Check for yours) to enter BIOS setup.\n2) Now enter advanced BIOS featured and change boot order.\nHope this helps.... \nRemember to like the blog and post comments.\nSorry I cant post Images as my rep is low. \nFor images go to the first link.\n", "Q: Using a windows based program on Ubuntu called Groupmail 5?

Install Wine from the Softwarecenter. Afterwards right click on your setup.exe file and select \"install with wine\" or something like that.\nFor better performance, if it doesn't work well: In the Wine preferences menu you can select which Windows version you want to simulate. There is also a software called \"winetricks\", with it you can install missing .dll files, fonts etc. \nFor further help you should consult the Wiki.\nhttp://wiki.winehq.org/FrontPage\nThere is also a page where you can browse programs and their functionality under wine. Groupware wasn't listed, which means, that nobody has tested it.\nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/index.php\nIf it doesn't work try virtualbox. Install it from the Softwarecenter, than install your windows inside and install your program inside windows. You can use it as a program window in Ubuntu. Try it, it is surprising.\nWell, and there are some Alternatives. Best one would be, as there isn't a native alternative, to work with Thunderbird Add-Ons. Open Thunderbird - Tools - Addons to search for thousands of addons. Mail merge Addon for example enables thunderbird to send the same mail to thousands of directions. Use it with caution! Other addons improve Address books.\n\nA: Groupware may have problems running under Wine.  See Wine forums.  I would recommend that you run it in a virtual machine, using something like VirtualBox.  Its available in Ubuntu Apps.  \nTo install, just click VirtualBox \n", "Q: Wireless problems on Ubuntu 12.04 x64 I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64 on my laptop.

This hardware should be more than enough to play 1080p videos and therefore problem is most likely with the driver (piece of software that makes it possible to use certain hardware).\nFrom the output for sudo lshw -c video we can see that the driver installed for graphics is the open source driver (i915) that was installed automatically with Ubuntu. As you are experiencing problems with this driver you should try alternative one that you can get directly from Intel:\nhttps://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads \n“Under Linux Graphics Installer” choose either 32 or 64 bit Ubuntu version according to what version of Ubuntu you using. I know it says it is for 13.04 but let's hope it works also on your 12.10. Install the package and it should install the correct driver for your hardware.

Before installating Windows, I had verified booting Ubuntu 13.04 from the new partition. But after installing Windows Vista, the Ubuntu partition is showing as unallocated.

Its only the Ubuntu partition that is showing unallocated/free.\nIs it possible to recover this Ubuntu partition? And if yes, what are the steps?\n\nA: It sounds to me like you told the installation of Windows to use the entire hard drive and it simply deleted all partitions and created new one(s). Recovering a partition is usually a difficult task but it gets more difficult and even impossible if you have overwritten sectors with new data. See here. If you have Windows there are other tools that you can use (->Google). Hiren's Boot CD also has a collection of recovery tools. Don't forget: try to avoid writing data to the hard disk as much as possible. Best way to do that is to use bootable OSs (Ubuntu Live, Hiren's Boot CD etc) because such systems load directly into the memory and do not require writing data to the HDD unless being told to do so.\n", "Q: How to disable and enable keyboard in ubuntu? How to disable and enable keyboard in ubuntu?\nI have a great trouble because I don't have enough space to put both my keyboard and some other things on my desk. And accidentally pressing some key may cause trouble to the system. So I am looking for one way to lock my keyboard temporarily. Of course I don't want to plug out the keyboard from the computer because it is so inconvenient. \nHow can I do with this?\nxinput -list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Optical Mouse                id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ CHICONY HP Basic USB Keyboard             id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HP WMI hotkeys                            id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\n\nA: Run xinput -list and find the id for AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as mentioned in the accepted answer. You may need to install xinput first.\nI created the following script, and I run this via a Launcher I can click on with my mouse. Each time you click it, it toggles on or off the keyboard.

All is well apart from WiFi and the Webcam. I'm using a £12 dongle to solve the WiFi problem, but it would be nice to be able to dispense with this at some stage.\nAs I understand things - not very well - the problem is that the laptop is using a fairly new wireless chip, the RTL8273AE-BT, and the drivers for this chip are not included in the current 12.04 kernel. I'm currently using 3.5.0-36. There are a number of links advising on how to install the drivers, but I haven't managed to get these to work.\nHowever, I also understand that the drivers are included in 3.8 and that this is used by 13.04. I don't want to switch to 13.04 - I like using LTS distributions - can anyone tell me whether:\n1 the RTL8273AE-BT are in 3.8 and\n2 whether 3.8 will eventually be used by 12.04 and, if so\n3 when?\n\nA: The driver rtl8723ae is included in 3.8. You can install 3.8 from here: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.8-raring/\nBe sure to download and install the version, either 32- or 64-bit, appropriate to your architecture.

I'm planning to install both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.04 on my desktop computer. I have two hard disks, one sized 250gb and one 160gb.

The hard disk order set in BIOS does not have any effect on this.\nThanks a lot! ;)\n\nA: What drive was BIOS set to boot from when you installed Windows? Windows installs a 100MB boot partition to the drive that BIOS boots from even if you install Windows to another drive?\nIf Windows is not fully on one drive, it may be best to reinstall, although you can copy the boot files from the boot partition to the install. The main reason for a separate Boot partition with Windows is so you can encrypt the main install as boot files cannot be encrypted. But it also has recovery (repair) files, so you should make the Windows repairCD before doing anything else.\nYou can always disconnect the Windows drive and then just install Ubuntu into the 160GB drive. After reconnecting Windows you can run the sudo update-grub to find Windows and add it to the grub menu.\nIf you have using Something Else or manual partitioning it should give you all the options of either hard drive and which drive to install grub2's boot loader into. You want grub in the MBR of the Ubuntu drive and Windows boot loader in the MBR of the Windows drive.  \nYou can also use gparted from liveCD or separate download of gparted to partition drives. Only use Windows tools to shrink Windows if needed (and always immediately reboot so it can repair itself to new size, but then use gparted to create Linux partitions. The you can use Something Else to specify which partition is / (root), and its format (ext4) and which is swap. If you want separate /home you can also create and mount that.\nBest to have a shared NTFS data partition for any data you may want to share between Windows and Linux. I tend to prefer smaller system partitions for both Windows & Linux & larger data (or /home) partitions. \n", "Q: Boot-repair not recovering, BIOS failing to see HDD I have been advised to post here re: my Phoenix BIOS not recognising (and therefore booting) from the HDD once Ubuntu 13.04 was installed.\nI have pasted the contents of the boot-repair tool below, which seemed like it knew what to fix with the MBR of the HDD, but it still does not show in BIOS and fails to load the OS.\nI have also recognised I am unable to even boot from the 13.04 live CD also, is this linked?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n=====================================\n\n Boot Info Script e7fc706 + Boot-Repair extra info      [Boot-Info 3June2013]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => Grub2 (v1.99) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda and looks at sector 1 of \n    the same hard drive for core.img. core.img is at this location and looks \n    in partition 94 for .\n\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ext4\n    Boot sector type:  Grub2 (v1.99-2.00)\n    Boot sector info:  Grub2 (v1.99) is installed in the boot sector of sda1 \n                       and looks at sector 96990360 of the same hard drive \n                       for core.img. core.img is at this location and looks \n                       in partition 94 for .\n    Operating System:  Ubuntu 13.04 \n    Boot files:        /boot/grub/grub.cfg /etc/fstab \n                       /boot/grub/i386-pc/core.img\n\nsda2: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       swap\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n\n============================ Drive/Partition Info: =============================\n\nDrive: sda _____________________________________________________________________\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 80.1 GB, 80060424192 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9733 cylinders, total 156368016 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n\nPartition  Boot  Start Sector    End Sector  # of Sectors  Id System\n\n/dev/sda1    *          2,048   151,554,047   151,552,000  83 Linux\n/dev/sda2         151,554,048   156,366,847     4,812,800  82 Linux swap / Solaris\n\n\n\"blkid\" output: ________________________________________________________________\n\nDevice           UUID                                   TYPE       LABEL\n\n/dev/loop0                                              squashfs   \n/dev/sda1        a9c996a1-b93b-4ae0-bb25-c74083240520   ext4       \n/dev/sda2        ffc7825d-ed7e-4fda-ae65-ffb0a12c7b09   swap       \n/dev/sr0                                                iso9660    Ubuntu 12.04 LTS i386\n\n================================ Mount points: =================================\n\nDevice           Mount_Point              Type       Options\n\n/dev/loop0       /rofs                    squashfs   (ro,noatime)\n/dev/sr0         /cdrom                   iso9660    (ro,noatime)\n\n\n=========================== sda1/boot/grub/grub.cfg: ===========================\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE\n#\n# It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates\n# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub\n#\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###\nif [ -s $prefix/grubenv ];

It can break hard drives making them not be able to be formatted properly \n\nA: \nFlashing the BIOS\nIn modern PCs the BIOS is stored in rewritable memory, allowing the\ncontents to be replaced or 'rewritten'. This rewriting of the contents\nis sometimes termed flashing. This can be done by a special program,\nusually provided by the system's manufacturer, or at POST, with a BIOS\nimage in a hard drive or USB flash drive. A file containing such\ncontents is sometimes termed 'a BIOS image'. A BIOS might be reflashed\nin order to upgrade to a newer version to fix bugs or provide improved\nperformance or to support newer hardware, or a reflashing operation\nmight be needed to fix a damaged BIOS. — Via Wikipedia\n\nIf I read this correctly you should be able to go to your computers manfac web site and get a bios update saved to a jump drive and flash the bios, unless the system in question is old enough to have EEPROM (doubtful from your description, I am glad dip switches are gone as well)\nAlthough you could try running freedos, install fdisk and see if the partitions got wonky when you tried to write a new OS worked for me when window stalled during a partition split fdisk and freedos allowed me to rewrite my partition have my bios recognize and install Ubuntu saving my system!\n", "Q: Basic Photo Editing tool suggestions Well I'm not a photographer and I'm kind of noob at editing photos. xD\nI need something basic and free.

Its goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful way to draw and manipulate images on Linux, Mac, and Windows.\nFeatures include:\n\n*\n\n*Adjustments (Auto level, Black and White, Sepia, …)\n\n*Effects (Motion blur, Glow, Warp, …)\n\n*Multiple layers\n\n*Unlimited undo/redo\n\n*Drawing tools (Paintbrush, Pencil, Shapes, …)\n\n*Cropping, Cutting and Selection tools\n\nIt's available in the Software Center by clicking Pinta \n\nA: Download and try gimp from the Software Center, a full featured image editor which can do as little or as much as you want.\nWhile a little difficult to use if you are new to it, it does what you want and has so many plug-ins it rivals Photoshop.\nTo install click Gimp \n\nA: By all means try Gimp but if you want a simpler option, take a look at Fotoxx. You can blur sections, fix red eye, cut & crop, resize and quite a bit more. Nowhere near as versatile as Gimp, but much easier to use. It's in the Package Manager.\n", "Q: Mouse and Ethernet not responding I just tried to install Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows 8 and the mouse and ethernet did not work during installation and continued not on to work when it was completed.\nThe keyboard works fine but it seems like I have to connect it to a USB 3 port.\nThe mouse doesn't respond anywhere.\nMy motherboard is  Gigabyte 970A-DS3.\nAlso,I tried to install Ubuntu 12.10 with the same results (I didn't finish the installation, I still have the 13.04 on my system).\nAny suggestions?

I am a lover of open source and I really want to install Ubuntu. But I afraid of something:\nwhen I was looking for the features of Ubuntu I saw that Ubuntu is including some programs like Mozilla and Libreoffice. But I already installed these programs to my windows XP OS. So, İf I install Ubuntu, then, will these programs re-install themselves? Should I uninstall these programs before installing Ubuntu?\nThanks Advance!\n\nA: Well, you shouldn't.\nMozilla and LibreOffice on your Windows XP where compiled for Windows to run on Windows. Applications on Linux(also Ubuntu) where compiled to run on this OS.\n\nA: I guess you're installing ubuntu as a dual boot win/linux system.\nThe windows versions of those programs are different binary executables than the linux versions.  So no, you don't need to uninstall the windows versions and they won't auto install in linux.  Though they may be installed as part of the linux install.\nWhen I first installed ubuntu I actually used many of the same apps because I used mostly programs that were linux ports.  Linux programs tend to be better behaved.  They won't install 3rd party codec packs or otherwise screw up the windows registry.  Which is not much of a problem in linux.\nWhich ubuntu version are you thinking of installing?  If it's an older XP computer I'd recommend avoiding ubuntu with the unity desktop.  I had it on a 4Gb i3 laptop and I yanked it because it was too slow.  If your computer has 1Gb or more I'd try kubuntu or xubuntu.  Less than 1Gb, xubuntu or lubuntu.  512Mb or less, definitely lubuntu.\n\nA: As @Arhimed has pointed out, the softwares running on Windows will not run on Ubuntu even if they are the same softwares (like Mozilla and LibreOffice). When you install Ubuntu, Mozilla and LibreOffice will be installed for Ubuntu (not reinstalled because the programs running on Windows and Ubuntu function independently). You should not uninstall the programs in Windows if you intend to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, because installing them in Ubuntu means they will work only in Ubuntu and not in Windows.\n\nA: Software installed on Ubuntu will only be accessible when logged into Ubuntu, just as software installed in Windows XP will only be available when you boot into windows XP. They are separate operating systems, with their own software installations.\nA simple way to think of dual booting is that each operating system is like a box, each box is filled with it's own stuff, though often stored in the same room.\nIf you want to remove software from Ubuntu because you don't need it in both operating systems you can safely do so using the Ubuntu software center, or using apt-get, provided the software isn't part of the desktop environment package, both Mozilla Firefox and LibreOffice are not part of the desktop environment package, you can safely remove them.\nIn order to remove an application, open the Ubuntu Software Center, search for the application, click Remove and authenticate with your password to remove it...

I have a completely free partition of 19.5 Gb (Windows is installed in another partition.) When I start Wubi, it suggests that I use about 12 Gb for Ubuntu. \nThe question is: Should I go with Wubi's suggestion or should I use the maximum possible that Wubi is allowing me (19 Gb)?\nAlso Wubi isn't letting me set a custom size (like 13.8 Gb for example). Is there a way around it?\n\nA: One of the main advantages of wubi is that you do not have to repartition and then can uninstall it with Windows and recover all the file space. It exists just as a file (root.disk) inside the Windows NTFS partition.\nIf you have a separate partition, it really is better to do a full dual boot install to that partition, even the developer of wubi expects you to do that.\nFrom the developer of wubi:\nhttp://howsoftwareisbuilt.com/2009/03/12/interview-with-agostino-russo-wubi-ubuntu/\nAgostino: Wubi actually wasn’t designed to do long-term installations. The main aim was really to let people try out Ubuntu with confidence. Normally, users that start with Wubi tend to upgrade to a full installation to a dedicated partition at the next release cycle.\nMore info on wubi:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi\n\nA: I was under the impression WUBI was installed in the existing windows partition not in a separate partition on it's own.

It originally had Windows Vista which worked just fine with my KVM.  In fact, the old machine is one of three I have on the KVM.  All work fine.\nAll of the installs listed below were replacement installs... ie... Ubuntu was the only operating system on the machine.\nInitially, I attemped to install 12.04 and kept getting a message that Ubuntu could not successfully detect my monitor, vid card, keyboard mouse.  The install did continue. After the install completed, the same message popped up when starting from the hard drive and desktop did not start... just command line linux.\nOk... I installed 11.04 and during hard drive boot the screen would just go black.  Next I tried 13.04 and got the message again during install.\nSo... I skipped the KVM and connected the monitor directly to the machine... bingo... 13.04 installed fine and a reboot from the hard drive and everything seemed just peachy.\nOk... acid test... the KVM was reconnected and a reboot from the hard drive attempted. The screen goes black, I can hear the Ubuntu drums, and the monitor simply remains black.\nSince the KVM worked just fine with Windows... I have no reason to believe its a hardware problem.\nAny ideas out there?  (and obviously I am a rube with linux and Ubuntu)\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\nA: Unlike Windows, Ubuntu tries to detect the video modes supported by the monitor and automatically choose the best one (for a TFT display, this would be the native resolution).\nI have had similar issues with a KVM which would cause Ubuntu to choose 1024×768 on a 1280×1024 TFT and not let me change the setting. When I hooked up the monitor directly to the PC, I got the correct resolution.\nApparently, there are a bunch of KVMs out there (presumably mostly older ones) which do not correctly pass extra signals which the OS uses to get the supported video modes from the display.\nI don't have a complete solution to offer, as I simply threw out my KVM since I didn't really need it. The best approach would probably be to manually force a particular resolution on the X server.\nTry searching this site for \"force resolution\" or \"force video mode\". My attempts to edit the X config file back then were not successful; some answers here suggest passing an option to GRUB – maybe that helps.\n", "Q: Unity Global Menu Integration missing for some programs First of All I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 and I don't remember this problem has ever been produced by the previous releases.\nUnity Global Menu Integration is missing not for all the applications but some of them.

Looking at https://askubuntu.com/a/207750/23678 how did the author know which dependency was missing? Is there a generic way to look up the list of dependencies of an executables and which ones are missing?\nUPDATE: I just noticed that noticed that https://stackoverflow.com/a/9082947/14731 used \n\nreadelf -l [executable]\n\nIs this the best approach?\n\nA: In the linked AskUbuntu question, the author knew which dependency was missing because he was trying to install a 32-bit application on a 64-bit Ubuntu installation, and, to quote him:\n\nsome 32 bit libraries are absent in Ubuntu 64 bit.\n\nSo he needed to install them.\nHowever, to answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to detect missing dependencies for an executable?\n\n*Is there a generic way to look up the list of dependencies of an executables and which ones are missing?\n\n\nYes, there is a way to detect missing dependencies or to get a list of them.\nDetect missing dependencies:\nThe package management system apt, used in Debian-based Linux distributions, is a clever system, where it will automatically detect if currently installed packages have missing dependencies (even if you have installed them using dpkg, and not apt-get). Let's say that you've installed a package, without its dependencies, then the next time you execute apt-get upgrade, you'll get an error similar to this:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n package1 : Depends: package2 (>= 1.8) but 1.7.5-1ubuntu1 is to be installed\n\nIndicating that package1 depends on package2, and package2 (namely, the newer version in this example) is not installed. Usually, to fix this, you execute the command sudo apt-get install -f, which instructs apt-get to attempt to retrieve and install the missing packages.\nLook up the list of dependencies of an executable:\nThe apt suite, as well as dpkg, provides a neat way to list the dependencies of a package.\n\n\n*\n\n*For apt, the command is:\napt-cache depends <packagename>\n\nThis will check the package in the repositories and list the dependencies, as well as \"suggested\" packages. If you really want to filter out the dependencies alone, you could filter the output by doing this: apt-cache depends <packagename> | grep Depends. Here's an example output:\nalaa@aa-lu:~$ apt-cache depends vlc\nvlc\n  Depends: fonts-freefont-ttf\n  Depends: vlc-nox\n |Depends: libavutil51\n  Depends: libxpm4\n  Depends: zlib1g\n  PreDepends: dpkg\n  Suggests: videolan-doc\n  Recommends: vlc-plugin-notify\n  Recommends: xdg-utils\n  Breaks: vlc-data\n  Breaks: vlc-nox\n  Replaces: vlc-data\n  Replaces: vlc-nox\nOutput is cut down for brevity.\n\n*For dpkg, the command to run it on a local file is:\ndpkg -I file.deb | grep Depends\n\ndpkg -I file.deb returns a lot of information about this .deb file, so we filter it to only look at the dependencies.\nSince apt is actually just a front-end for dpkg, both these commands essentially do the same exact thing, they go look at the .deb file of the application to find out what dependencies it needs, except apt-cache will look in the repositories. These \"dependencies\" are listed inside the .deb file as metadata, that is why even if you have manually downloaded and installed an application (which is usually a .deb file, so you'll be installing it using dpkg and not apt) from a website (for example, Google's Chrome browser from Google's website), apt will still find out that there are missing dependencies, by analyzing the installed packages. \n\nI'm not well versed with all this computer architecture stuff, but in the case of Java in that question, it's really about the 32- and 64-bit architecture. To quote the answer from stackoverflow:\nYou're running on a 64bit system without a 32bit runtime environment.\nThat specific library, that needed to be installed, was not included in the \"Depends\" part of the installation package, because he was installing a 32-bit application on a 64-bit system. So, extra troubleshooting was needed to find the culprit, hence the use of readelf and ldd. However, these are probably more specific to libraries, and remember that \"dependencies\" are not always \"libraries\", but could be other applications. So \"Is this the best approach?\", I doubt it; I think it's only best when extra troubleshooting is needed.\n", "Q: How to solve \"duplicated Calibre icon\" issue?

You need additional programms like Ext2Read to display the content of that partition in Windows. The other way around it is much easier because Linux kernel supports Microsofts NTFS by default.

I was expecting a .deb file but instead I got this: http://whatpulse.org/downloads/50/64bit/\n\nA: What you linked is a standalone binary. According to my file:\nfile whatpulse \nwhatpulse: ELF 64-bit LSB  executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=b6027484908c5a05d8b32e4dd5c342fc12bf6670, not stripped\nJust extract it, mv it to wherever you want (as per *nix standard the /opt/ is for just this scenario), and if you want bash to recognize it ln -s it to /usr/local/bin/.\n\nA: It appears you clicked one of the download links marked Generic. That's understandable, since the site strangely uses the Ubuntu logo to represent the generic download.\nYou'll probably be best served to get the .deb package. These links are marked Debian. Ubuntu is based on Debian; both use .deb packages and most .deb packages for Debian will work reasonably well on Ubuntu. (Not all.) Usually if the only available .deb pakage for a program is for Debian rather than Ubuntu, it's worth trying to install using that.\n\nSo on the WhatPulse download page, under Download for Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*click Debian (7.0+) 32bit if you're running the 32-bit version of Ubuntu.\n\n*click Debian (7.0+) 64bit if you're running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu.\n\n\n(The link you included in your question is a 64-bit download link, so I'm guessing you have the 64-bit version. But if you're not sure if your Ubuntu system is 32-bit or 64-bit, you should check. One way to check is to open a Terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and run the command uname -m. x86_64 means you have a 64-bit PC or Intel Mac. i686 means you have a 32-bit PC or Intel Mac.)\nYou should be able to install the software by double-clicking on the .deb file after downloading it. If not:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the Software Center to install gdebi, and use gdbei to install the package.\n\n*Or you can always do it in the Terminal. To do that, in a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T), type sudo dkpg -i, including a space after -i. Drag the downloaded .deb file into the Terminal--this will paste its full path. Press Enter to run the command. Enter your password when prompted (in the Terminal, it doesn't look like anything is happening when you type a password, but it's receiving it; just type it in and press Enter.)\nIf you are told during installation that some dependencies were unsatisfied, then you can usually fix this by telling Ubuntu's package management system to automatically install them. To do this, open a Terminal window (if you don't have one open already) by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and run these two commands, letting the first finish before running the second:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nYou may be prompted for your password; as above, no placeholder characters (like *) appear as you type it in, but that's no problem, just type it and press Enter.\nBefore following any advice in this answer, please check out the warning at the bottom. I don't put a generic disclaimer on my work; it speaks to the circumstances of this particular question and answer.\nWhy I Recommend Installing the Debian Package\nSome people recommend against \"cross-installation,\" the installation of software intended for one version of Ubuntu on another, or intended for another operating system (like Debian) that uses .deb packages on Ubuntu.\nOf course the best thing to do is to get a package that it made for the version of Ubuntu you are running. If that doesn't exist, the best thing to do is to build the software from source yourself (assuming you don't make mistakes while doing so). Unfortunately that is not an option here; WhatPulse is closed source and the source code is not available (see below for details on that).\nIf you can't install a package meant for your version of Ubuntu and you can't install from source code, there are other options. WhatPulse provides precompiled binaries for manual installation and a system configuration script (see Wolfer's answer, and the Alternate Way section of this answer, below). Alternatively, you can install .deb packages advertised for a system other than yours, on your system; that's cross-installation.\nSome people say it's best to avoid cross-installation even if there is no package built for your Ubuntu release and no source code that you can build yourself. This is a reasonable position, but I disagree. I think cross-installation is most likely your best option, in this particular situation. Here's why:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any package that is intended to work on multiple releases of Debian is likely to work on Ubuntu, too. If it works properly on multiple Debian releases then it probably doesn't have such narrow requirements regarding the toolchain with which its dependencies were built, that it would likely be a problem on Ubuntu.\n\n*To benefit from a package that is really intended for your Ubuntu release, the package has to be built specifically for your release, using the toolchain (compiler, linker, and other tools) for your release. Except software from official Ubuntu repositories and from PPA's (which fortunately covers a lot of software ...but not WhatPulse), it's very rare for any package to be build this way. If it were build this way, they'd be offering multiple Ubuntu packages or stipulating that the package they offer is specifically intended to be run on a particular version of Ubuntu. This is not unheard of, but it is very rare.\nMost of the time, what it means for a third-party-provided, non-PPA .deb package to be an Ubuntu package is that the developer or webmaster happened to include the word \"Ubuntu\" in its description on the website.\n\n*Lots of widely respected, professional-quality software is offered as a single .deb package (or a 32-bit package and a 64-bit package) for all reasonably current Debian and Ubuntu systems. Google Chrome is one example. It was probably tested on both systems, but it is still a \"cross-installation\" for every system except the specific version of whichever of the two OSes it was built on.\n\n*Some objections to cross-installation are based on concerns that installing a .deb package for a different OS could put your Ubuntu system's package manager into a broken state. This is possible, but I'm not aware of any evidence that this is more likely to occur as a result of cross-installation than as a result of any other installation of a non-official, non-PPA package. (PPA packages are built on Launchpad with the proper toolchain so they tend to install and uninstall properly, though not always.) Furthermore, such problems are almost always very easy to fix, and there are lots of Internet resources (including Ask Ubuntu) to help you fix them.\n\n*When you install a .deb package (any .deb package, whether intended for a different OS or Ubuntu release, or not), the package manager runs as root and performs systemwide configuration changes, which can potentially break things other than the system that keeps track of what packages are installed and facilitates the package installation, uninstallation, and upgrading. However, if you download the \"Generic\" distribution of WhatPulse, there is a script you have to run (as root), which makes the same kind of modifications. So that is unlikely to be a disadvantage of cross-installation, in this situation.\nAlternate Way\nI don't recommend you use this way unless installing the Debian package as explained above doesn't work, or for some reason you don't want to do it that way. Furthermore, if the above way doesn't work, it might still be easier, or produce better results, for you to comment and/or edit your question to explain the problem (then you can get further help, specific to whatever problem occurs).\nIf you do want to install from the \"generic\" .tar.gz file you downloaded, first make sure it's for the correct architecture. That is, make sure it's the 32-bit version if you're running the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, or the 64-bit version if you're running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu.\nMost software distributed as a .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or .tar.xz (there are some other variants) is source code that you have to compile. However, WhatPulse is proprietary \"freeware\" (gratis but not free as in freedom), and as is often the case for such software, its source code is not published.\nThe .tar.gz file for WhatPulse contains the actual executable binary, together with a script that installs it and a readme file. This is an archive (sort of like a .zip file on Windows), so you can double-click on it to view its contents, or right-click on it and click Extract Here.\nFirst, read the readme file (README.txt), and take a look at the web page it points to. If the resources there--which are likely to be kept more up to date than this ansswer (though you or anyone may feel free to edit this answer to keep it up to date!)--conflict with the advice here, you should most likely do what it says (but use your judgment).\n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't actually extracted the contents of the .tar.gz file yet, do that.\n\n*Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T). Change directory in the Terminal to the directory where you extracted the .tar.gz file. One way to do this is to type cd (with a space at the end) in the Terminal, then drag the folder from Nautilus (the file browser) into the Terminal, then press Enter.\n\n*Based on the information currently here, I've guessed as to exactly what Ubuntu packages may be needed as dependencies of WhatPulse. I've deliberately guessed broadly; that is, I suspect that perhaps some of the following libraries may not be necessary, but I'm trying to increase the chance that this will work. So, according to my guess, the following commands should install the libraries upon which WhatPulse depends, in order to work on Ubuntu.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libqtcore4 libqtwebkit4 libqt4-sql libqt4-sql-sqlite libssl-dev libqtscript4-core libqtscript4-gui libqtscript4-network libqtscript4-webkit libpcap0.8 libpcapnav0\n\nYou can, of course, copy and paste from your web browser into your Terminal; you don't have to manually type any of this.\n\n*Run the setup script that gives WhatPulse the ability to monitor what you do on your computer:\nsudo sh setup-input-permissions.sh\nMove or copy the WhatPulse executable program (the file called just whatpulse) wherever you want it. There's no need to do this part in the Terminal, though you certainly an if you know how.\nIf you want to be able to launch it by typing whatpulse (in a Terminal, or in the Unity dash), it's best to put it somewhere in your executable search path. I recommend putting it in the bin folder inside your home folder. (If that folder doesn't exist, you can create it). If your bin folder did not exist before, you'll have to log out and back in (or reboot, if you prefer) for files in there to be automatically found when you try to run them\nAfter all that, assuming everything worked, you should be able to run whatpulse from the Terminal or by pressing Alt+F2 (and typing it in, and pressing Enter or clicking on whatpulse if it comes up).\nThere is no need to run whatpulse itself with sudo. You should not do that (and it looks like it might not work if you do; it's not intended to be run that way).\nI'm not sure if WhatPulse will give you the option of making it start up automatically when you run it. But if it doesn't, and if you want it to start automatically, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I start applications automatically on login?\n\nFinally, please note that I have not used WhatPulse, and am only\n  vaguely familiar with it. This means two things.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*It means I cannot be sure this will work--I don't have the ability to try it out myself first.\n  \n*It also means I cannot vouch for the security of WhatPulse, or be sure that it works the way it says it does, and so forth. I am not\n  saying it doesn't, just that I don't know enough about it to say\n  (which is why I don''t have the \"ability\" to try it out myself first).\n\n", "Q: Diagnosing freezing/hanging How can I diagnose random freezing on Ubuntu? I've tried fresh reinstalls several times but the OS still freezes often.\n\nA: The freezing usually can occur due to HDD failing or/and a problem with graphics card driver. \n\n\n*\n\n*So first check the HDD for bad sectors. Open the Disks utility and check the S.M.A.R.T and see if disk is Healthy. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then you can install an additional driver for your graphics card (if any).

I don't know where the problem is. \n\nA: You most likely have one or more non-printing characters at the start of the script, which are invisible when you look at the script in an editor (or via 'cat') but are preventing the correct csh interpreter from being invoked. The remaining errors are probably just because the system is falling back to the default (bash) shell in which syntax like \nif ($1 != \"\") cd $1\n\nis incorrect, and will disappear once you fix the shebang line so that the intended shell is invoked. \nI'm not sure the best way to remove non-printing characters - you could try something like\nsed -i '1 s/^[^#]*//' most_plasim_run\n\nwhich will delete anything up to the first # character in line 1 of the script - or you could open a new empty file and insert a 'clean' shebang line\n#!/bin/csh\n\nand then copy and paste the rest of the script in and re-save it.\n\nA: You get those errors because you don't have csh shell interpreter installed. csh is a shell with C-like syntax. To install it, run next command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge csh\n\nIn rest, the script looks ok.\n", "Q: Where to set up Workspaces & 10.04 Look & Feel?

For example there is a lot of text editors, media players, text editors, mail clients, etc, but only one of each group is selected to be delivered as pre-installed in the next version of Ubuntu. So, I'd like to know how are those applications rated to become a pre-installed application?\nDo it need to be not that great so that applications other developers have written have the chance to be installed by the user? For example, let's say that the application AAA is the best of its group, but if this application is used as default/pre-installed, other applications from the same group will probably not be installed by the users because they will know that AAA is the best.\n\nA: Default applications in Ubuntu (except the phone) are decided by the Ubuntu Desktop Team https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam .\nTheir mission is to produce a desktop that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stable\n\n*Usable\n\n*Accessible\n\n*Attractive\n\n*Consistent\n\n*Discoverable\n\n*Immediately useful\n\n\nTheir goal for the default applications on the install image is to provide a great experience for a wide variety of users, everything from business to gaming to internet surfing to multimedia. They must also keep the image size as small as possible for faster downloading. This means that the install image must be broad but shallow - which generates complaints from some users that the image is too sparse in their preferred specialty uses.\nThey do not like to change applications (which would violate \"Consistent\") without good reasons and plenty of discussion on the mailing list.\n\nA: Ubuntu used to inherit a lot of its default apps from Gnome, which was the default desktop.\nThat gave us Nautilus the file manager, gedit the text editor, gnome-terminmal, Totem the movie player and a lot of other default apps. Earlier on it also gave us e.g. the email client Evolution  and Epiphany for web browsing.\nUbuntu also inherits from Debian, and that gives us defaults like Firefox the webbrowser (Iceweasel in Debian).\nOther apps have simply been selected for being \"best of brand\" and contributing to the best desktop experience, like Brasero for creating CDs and Banshee for playing music (except Banshee is no longer default AFAIK, Rhythmbox is back). I don't think \"best of brand\" are DEslected, I just think the default app for an action must be one of the best available for that purpose, and must fit in seamlessly in the desktop experience.\nI suspect the last reason is why the arguably better VLC is not the default video player - it's not as integrated in Gnome and Unity and drags in more dependencies.\n", "Q: juju bootstrap not working for MAAS I'm following this doc to implement openstack using MAAS and JUJU:\nUbuntu Cloud Infrastructure with MAAS and Juju\nSo to setup JUJU, im following this one: Get Started With Juju\nAny idea about how to fix this one?\nroot@ubuntu:~/.juju# juju status -e maas -v\n2013-07-28 17:31:47 ERROR juju supercommand.go:235 command failed: file 'provider-          state' not found not found\nerror: file 'provider-state' not found not found\n\nroot@ubuntu:~/.juju# juju bootstrap -e maas -v\n2013-07-28 17:36:27 ERROR juju supercommand.go:235 command failed: cannot create     bootstrap state file: gomaasapi: got error back from server: 400 BAD REQUEST\nerror: cannot create bootstrap state file: gomaasapi: got error back from server: 400     BAD REQUEST\n\nmaas section of environments.yaml\n  maas:\ntype: maas\n# Change this to where your MAAS server lives.

Was this a wrong decision? Why diskutility shows it as 2 separate 12gb parts??? Says one is sda1 extended and sda5 logical divided in 2 parts.Please help...\n\nA: What you see is completely normal.\nAn extended partition is a partition that contains another partition-table and acts as the \"physical\" drive to store data on.\nA logical partition is simply a partition which resides on an extended partition.\nThe above described behavior is because a partition table is only capable of using 4 partitions. And if you want to have 5 partitions you have to make a partition extended and have 2 more partitions on it as logical (resulting in 6 partitions).\nThey use only 12GB of physical space and not 24GB.\n", "Q: Google Chrome themes are not transparent I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit and Google Chrome version 28.0.1500.71 (the latest as of this writing).\nThere are a lot of themes with transparency in the Chrome Web Store, but they never work on my system.

I'm using PowerTop v2.1 in Ubuntu 13.04 and I'm getting some pretty strange readings. I've already run powertop --calibrate too. The main screen reads this:\n\nAs you can see, the power estimates do add up to about 12.8W, perhaps a bit more.

If they were caused by a failing hard disk, then you will probably get similar problems with Ubuntu. \nCheck your disk for errors and if bad sectors show up, you need to consider forking out for a new HDD \n\nA: It really depends on the error.\nIf it is an hardware fault then nothing can be done by a change of operating system.\nIt if an operating system problem, then moving to another OS (like Ubuntu) can solve the problem.\n", "Q: uninstall lubuntu 13.04 to not interfere with built in win 7 installer Due to software problems, I need to uninstall lubuntu 13.04 off of my computer. It is a vaio and has a built in function to install windows 7 from scratch without a disk, I usually use this when I need to reinstall windows so it works pretty well.  \nAbout two years ago I had lubuntu installed and had to switch back to windows. When I used the restore function It gave me an error along the lines of \"failed to save grub\" (I dont remember the exact text). Apparently this had to do with lubuntu not being removed properly. luckily i had a win 7 recovery disk lying around and used command prompt to fix the problem.  \nUnfortunately I no longer have a recovery disk, is there a way to properly uninstall lubuntu so that the built in windows install can properly work?\n\nA: I don't know if there is a place where you can download a copy of windows 7 legitimately. What I did was go to the piratebay.se and download myself a copy and of windows 7. I do not condone pirating but by doing this you can burn the CD and have access to the recovery utilities. I personal do not consider this pirating because I am not using the software other than just the recovery tools, and I have paid for windows so I just re install with the computers product key if i have to.\n\nA: You can indeed download Windows 7 iso legally from digitalriver, Microsoft's online distribution parter.   Pick your language: forums.mydigitallife.info\nYou can remove the ei.cfg from the install iso to enable different editions selection.  You can also inject the oem certificate and oem key by following step 6 of the \"Official Windows 7 Repository\" thread on mdl forums.  But using the key from the sticker on the computer is easier.\n", "Q: Can I do something with my partitions so I can install Windows alongside Ubuntu? I had Windows and installed Ubuntu alongside.

Then install windows from the CD to that partition (it will automatically pick that up as the partition to install to). You may need create an Ubuntu liveCD, and use it to reinstall grub, as windows will have replaced grub with its bootloader. (I can provide a link on how to do this if necessary). TL;DR make sure there is an NTFS partition somewhere on the disk.\n", "Q: Windows 8 doesn't appear in the bootloader after installing Ubuntu 13.04 On my windows 8 PC I installed ubuntu 13.04 through USB. After that no option to select Windows 8 was in the bootloader. How can I add Windows 8 to the bootloader?\n\nA: You can download and install GRUB Customizer. Not simple to use, but it may help, and it's better than editing the Bootloader menu by hand :)\nTo download, open Software Center and search for grub customiser.

Here is how I tried to install Ubuntu:\n• Disabled Secure Boot, loaded live USB with 12.10 x64 \n• Created 30.0GB partition in Windows for Ubuntu  \n• Installed Ubuntu  \n• DURING INSTALLATION: The wizard asked me if I wanted to create a swap partition. I was told by a previous guide not to use the wizard partition manager, but I thought creating a swap would be a good idea. So I made a with 500MB swap partition. \nAfter installation, I installed boot repair.\nNow Grub starts up perfectly fine on startup, but when selecting Windows 8, I only come to a HP Boot Repair screen, which is futile. So here are my problems:\n• I cannot access the partition with my Windows 8 files through the HP backup software partition.   \n• I cannot boot into Windows 8. \n• I cannot access the Windows 8 partition through Ubuntu to rescue my files.    \nI believe it is because I created a swap partition, and now I am stuck. Formatting my hard drive is my last resort. I AT LEAST want to backup my files from my Windows 8 partition. \n\nA: When you get to the HP Boot Repair screen. Repair the Windows installation. This should repair the Windows bootloader, you may need to repeat the Grub Repair after this has been done, but it should only be that file that's been corrupted.\n", "Q: Arrow keys, Home, End, tab-complete keys not working in shell I have installed ubuntu minimal(mini.iso) on my vm. I then used recovery mode to login as root and create an account with useradd -m admin and then set a password with passwd admin.\nWhen I login on the new account, instead of the normal prompt I only see a $ sign. If I try to tab-complete a command or file name it prints a normal tab. If I try to use the arrow keys it prints ^[[A, ^[[B, ^[[C or ^[[D. Also, ls no longer adds colors.\nNone of these problems were in recovery mode. How can I fix this?\n\nA: I was unable to use tab completion when connecting via VNC to a headless XFCE4. The answer listed here did not work but this did:\nEdit Keyboard Shortcuts in xml file:\nsudo nano ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml\n\nFind: \n<property name=\"&lt;Super&gt;Tab\" type=\"string\" value=\"switch_window_key\"/>\n\nChange it to:\n<property name=\"&lt;Super&gt;Tab\" type=\"empty\"/>\n\nLogout/reboot and should be good to go\n\nA: That probably means that the new user account was created with /bin/sh as its login shell (which symlinks to the dash shell by default) instead of /bin/bash - you can change a user's login shell with the 'chsh' command\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nor to change another user's login shell (need to be root to do this obviously)\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash <username>\n\n(you will need to start a new login session for the change to take effect). You may also need to copy the default .bashrc from /etc/skel to get things like the color prompt and default LS_COLORS.\nIn future you might want to use the 'adduser' command instead of 'useradd' - it sets up a more complete user environment including things like a default .profile and .bashrc - as well as setting the login shell to 'bash'\n\nA: I just installed Vim and everything was solved. At first, I thought that it was installed on the original version of Ubuntu since I was able to use Vi command, but it was not the case.\nsudo apt-get install vim \n\nsolved the problem.\n\nA: sudo sh -c \"if [ -e $(which bash) ]; then rm $(which sh) && ln -s $(which bash) /bin/sh; fi\"\n\nMy problem was that /bin/sh was symlinked to /bin/dash.\n\nA: In my case it turned out to be a function that I had created in my .bash-aliases file called \"test\". If you are still having these errors, go through your custom aliases in .bashrc, .bash_profile, and .bash_aliases, temporarily removing any suspect additions and try bash auto-complete again.\n\nA: If everything else is working, but just certain filename completion (autocomplete) attempts fail, it might be that you lack permission to search a directory that is a component of the path.\nSuppose you want the listing for some other user's .bash_profile file.  The following ls command will work; because sudo runs the ls command with the required permission.\n$ sudo ls -al /home/someone_else/.bash_profile    \n\nHowever, if you try to use filename completion, the tab completion does nothing.\n$ sudo ls -al /home/someone_else/.bash_pr<tab>   # does not complete\n\nThat is because the bash completion is operating before sudo gets invoked.  The command might as well be:\n$ ls -al /home/someone_else/.bash_pr<tab>   \n\nBecause permission to search that directory is lacking, the command completion does nothing.\nTo temporarily run with greater permissions, you can start a new shell with sudo.\n$ sudo bash\n\nThe ls command can now be run without the sudo predicate, and autocomplete works.  (Note that the prompt switches from $ to #.)\n# ls -al /home/someone_else/.bash_pr<tab>   \n\nJust make sure you kill the shell when your task is completed; a shell with this much power is dangerous.\n# exit\n\n\nA: You can also experience tab-completion failure if you're trying to tab-complete a filename with a wrong (or missing) suffix for the command it's being used with in the tab completion.\nAs an example, tab completion failed on the command+file:\ntotem ~/Videos/SomefilenameWithNoSuffix\nbut worked perfectly after I had renamed the .mkv to ~/Videos/SomefilenameWithNoSuffix.mkv\n\nA: This will solve all: paste and press .

Another option is to create a file /home/(username)/.kde/share/kde4/services/plasma-runner-bookmarks.desktop with contents\nX-KDE-PluginInfo-EnabledByDefault=false\n\nThis has the advantage over modifying the file in /usr/share/kde4/ that it will certainly persist software updates, and even OS reinstall if you have a separate home partition.\n(I have tested this on openSUSE 13.1, where the file path is /home/(username)/.kde4/share/kde4/services/plasma-runner-bookmarks.desktop, but I guess Ubuntu uses .kde instead of .kde4)\n\nA: Doesn't look like there's any way to do it in the UI.\nBut, you can edit the /usr/share/kde4/services/plasma-runner-bookmarks.desktop file.\nkdesudo kate /usr/share/kde4/services/plasma-runner-bookmarks.desktop\n\nFind this line:\nX-KDE-PluginInfo-EnabledByDefault=true\n\nand change it to:\nX-KDE-PluginInfo-EnabledByDefault=false\n\nYou'll have to restart plasma for it to take effect:\nkquitapp plasma-desktop\nplasma-desktop\n\nI'm not sure if this change will persist when KDE is updated, though.  My recommendation would be to instead avoid all this trouble by just using the lancelot application launcher (package name is plasma-widget-lancelot).

If that doesn't work you can change the permissions of a file like so:\nsudo chmod u+w file.txt\n\nThe above will add write permissions for User to file.txt.

Basically, though, repairing GRUB at this point requires a fair amount of expertise.\nA simpler approach might be the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*On another computer, download the USB flash drive or CD-R image of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare the USB flash drive or CD-R with rEFInd.\n\n*Use the USB flash drive or CD-R to boot your troubled computer. (You may need to select a firmware option to boot from the external medium. Unfortunately, these options vary greatly from one computer to another.) With any luck, rEFInd will show options to boot both Windows and Linux. (There may be multiple Linux options.)\n\n*Try both the Windows and Linux options.\n\n*If both Windows and Linux boot, install the rEFInd .deb package in Ubuntu.\n\n\nIf you have problems with rEFInd, then your recovery will require more diagnosis. To that end, you should run the Boot Info Script and post a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it generates. That script's output will provide details of your configuration that should help in getting things working.\n", "Q: Why this .pam_environment setting prevents me from logging in?

So, yesterday I installed Ubuntu on my laptop (1920x1200), which I mainly use docked with a second monitor (ViewSonic VA720, VGA, 1280x1024). At first the second monitor wasn't detected at all, so I installed the Nvidia-313 driver (I am currently running the Nvidia-310 driver, figured I'd see if it made a difference; it did not.) Well, the monitor is now detected, however the native resolution is not an option. It only allows the display to work in 1024x768.\nI've tried creating a new mode in the terminal under 'xrandr', however when I try adding the mode to my monitor (VGA-0) the output is:\nX Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  140 (RANDR)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  18 (RRAddOutputMode)\n  Serial number of failed request:  31\n  Current serial number in output stream:  32\n\nI've tried editing my resolution in 'Nvidia Xserver Settings', however when I set the 'ViewportIn' and 'Panning' to their proper values it won't allow me to change the value of 'ViewportOut'.

Therefore, I formatted the whole system and installed Ubuntu 13.04.\nNow the problem is when I was installing Ubuntu , it didn't ask for disk partitioning and just installed. So now when I installed GParted in Ubuntu, I got this result.\n\nSo now firstly I need to know what this means?? Please answer comparing with Windows because I am new to Ubuntu. \nAnd secondly, can I partition this space into volumes like we have in Windows?\nSorry if I have been not clear....\nWould be thankful for any views...\nThanks a lot in advance.\n\nA: Okay, so here's my mini-guide to disk referencing in Linux. \nThis is a simple partition table, and allows me to work easily explaining what it all means. You have two primary partitions here: /dev/sda1/ and /dev/sda2/.\n/dev is short for 'device'. It is the special filesystem which contains nodes describing devices found and recognized by the system. For example, sda is your hard disk, /dev/sr0 refers to CD-ROM and /dev/psaux to mouse. sda1 and sda2 are both primary partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 is where GRUB files are stored and is the partition that your system boots into.\n\n*sda2 is an extended partition. An extended partition is a type of logical partition that has the ability to split itself up into numerous partitions. You may ask, 'Why would you need this when you create other partitions?'. Well, because the MBR partition table only allows up to four primary partitions, extended partitions allow you more; extended partitions also make it a lot easier to manage dual booting systems. sda2 is an extended partition that may contain multiple partitions within itself, but it must be primary partition.\n\n*sda5 is the Ubuntu OS and all of it's storage. When you click on 'file system' in Ubuntu, you're looking at the data in sda5.\n\n\nTo answer your question about being able to partition this space into volumes: yes you can. For example if you want to create a separate partition for storage, you would remove some space from /dev/sda5, and create a new volume — logical partition under /dev/sda2, your extended partition. Refer to this instruction for more details.\nSummary: /dev/sda is where GRUB is stored, /dev/sda1/ is where GRUB files are stored. /dev/sda2/ is extended partition and /dev/sda5 is where your OS and storage are. Yes, you can partition this space into volumes, not like you can in Windows, but it is possible.\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

I wish I could post images, but my rep on here isn't high enough. Any help is appreciated. \n\nA: Knowing what graphics card you have would be helpful.\nInstall your recommended graphics driver. To do so, go to 'Software & Updates', then go to the 'additional drivers' tab. Select the proprietary driver from your GPU manufacturer; preferably one that's tested if it's available, if not just install the newest one and reboot your machine.\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

If you have the time I would appreciate a reply to my email\nThank You In Advance\nRoger\n\nA: Do you have a live USB or CD for ubuntu? If you do, you can boot into the live version of ubuntu and use the program gparted to reformat your hard drive.\nGparted is a pretty simple program to use but a very powerful application that can cause some serious problems if not used carefully. That said, you really have two options for reformatting your hard drive. You could create a new partition table which would completely wipe your hard drive then you could partition it any way you wanted and then format the partitions with gparted. The other option is to just reformat the partition with ubuntu on it. \nFrom your brief explanation of your problem, you could probably just reformat the partition which I will give some instruction for below along with a supplementary link to some more comprehensive instructions.\nWARNING:\nBoth of these processes will remove any data/files you have on the parition that is to be reformatted or the entire hard drive if you create a new partition table. Needless to say, if you have anything you want to keep from ubuntu make sure to save it on an external thumb drive or hard drive. There are ways to retrieve removed files but its not a very pleasant experience.\nReformat Partition with gparted:\nFirst off you will need to have either a liveusb or livecd of ubuntu or linux mint.\nBoot up into ubuntu or mint and enter the following command into the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nsudo gparted\n\nIf gparted is already installed you can skip the first command but running it won't hurt anything. However, installing gparted does require an internet connection but it should come pre-installed with a newer ubuntu iso.\nYou will then be prompted for a password that should be the same as the password you entered when creating the live media. If successful a screen similar to this one should pop up.\n\nOnce the application has loaded and gparted has scanned your drive, Go to the upper right corner of the screen and select the device you wish to work on (the drive with ubuntu on it), click on the partition you wish to format which should be /dev/sda1 if the ubuntu partition is the only thing on your hard drive.\nAfter selecting the partition you wish to format, go up to the menu-bar and select \"Partition\" then \"Format to\". This will display a list of different formats. What format you end up choosing will depend on what you plan to install after you remove ubuntu. If you are planning on installing windows, you will need to format it to NTFS. Another linux distro will probably require ext3 or ext4 along with some other partitions like a swap partition.\n\nAfter you have selected the proper format, gparted will add the formatting process to pending operations. Once you are ready, click the green check mark that has the label \"apply all operations\". Gparted will format your partition and your done (kinda).\n\nIf you are interested in just creating a new partition table, this article should be helpful. Using GParted to Partition a Hard Disk\nOn a final note, like Marc commented below you will need another installation medium. Whether that is the ubuntu livecd/usb you just used, a linux mint livecd/usb or a windows installation disk, you will need a bootable installation device otherwise you are kinda stuck with a reformatted hard drive with no operating system.\nHope this was of some use and if you have any more questions I or one of the other forum perusers would/should be happy to help.\n", "Q: how do I choose the font/s I want in what programs I want? As recommended by Bobby Phoenix, I had copied the fonts folder from Windows to Ubuntu and put it on my desktop. I installed Fonty Python from the USC and I then made a Pog of the fonts I want to include in Mozilla Thunderbird (to start). How (by what process/es) are the new fonts (within the newly created Pog) placed within the particular program that I want (in this case Thunderbird)?\nP.S. what does Pog stand for?\nP.P.S.Thanks for your help Bobby\n\nA: Fonts are installed in your font folders. All installed fonts should be available in the programs. To install a font just double-click on the font-file (on your desktop, as you said) and install. There are also lots of fonts available from the Fonts-Section in the Softwarecenter! There is a package called ttf-mscorefonts-installer, which installs all default Windows-fonts on your system (Arial, Comic sans, Helvetica etc.).\nIt is not neccesary to use programs like Fonty Python, but it helps to manage huge font collections. What does Fonty Python? It just stores groups of fonts (pogs), to install and uninstall them easily. This can be usefull, if you want to use a set of rare fonts in a design project, which you will never again use. Finishing your project, you can uninstall all those fonts in a pog with one click.\nWhere are your fonts? You can see a list of your fonts in the file /etc/fonts/fonts.conf. In the first part, it should show this:\n-- Font directory list --\n/usr/share/fonts\n/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts\n/usr/local/share/fonts\nMost important directory is /usr/share/fonts. With gnome-font-viewer you can see all installed fonts. For non-professional use, I wouldn't recommend Fonty-Python, but the program font-manager.\n", "Q: Unrar: Resulting files vanishing Ok, so I have a directory which contains a whole load of folders containing RAR files, which I'd like to use a script to recursively unrar.\nThe script I have seems to work (extracting the resulting file to the directory/folder from which it's run from), however once it's finished extracting the file - it vanishes, and moves onto the next one, which vanishes also.\nRegardless, the resulting un-extracted file keeps vanishing - and I have no idea why.

I am an ex-owner of (I think) the same Toshiba notebook and had bad experience years ago. However things have changed and improved (more or less) so drivers will probably not be an issue. Before you install a new OS, it is always a good idea to do some research and see if others had good/bad experience with Ubuntu and your model in particular. Drivers provided by the notebook-manufacturers are in 99% of all cases extremely outdated. They usually provide some drivers once (when the model appears on the market) and that's it. So you will probably get newer (and better) drivers than you have in Windows (unless you install for example customized GPU drivers in Windows like I do).\nI might be going too far but I do believe that if the drivers are the only thing that keeps Vista Home Edition on your hard drive you should format your hard drive (after you make sure that you won't have too many troubles with having just Linux on your notebook) and install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit install with Win 7-64 - no OS found I attempted to install Ubuntu 13.04 with Windows 7 64 bit on an HP DV7t-7000 notebook.

I tried using EasyTAG to do it, but it lacks the feature of letting me embed a poster image on the files.\n\nA: Try Kid3 which is available in Ubuntu Software Center. It has the ability to add album artwork image.\n", "Q: Can't make intel hd 4000 drivers to work After replacing my xserver with\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg \n\nI can't get my Intel HD 4000 card to work in 12.04. Or to be more specific, I can't get the effects that I had with unity working again. Even changing workspaces looks ugly now. \nI've searched this forum and googled everything about intel hd 4000 drivers + ubuntu but no luck. Everything I found was about linux 13.04. Please help me. How to get my good looking system back?\nI've installed mesa-utils but System Details still doesn't recognize my graphics card.\n\n\n\nA: Do you have the following packages installed?\n$ dpkg -l | grep intel | awk '{print $2}'\nintel-gpu-tools\nlibdrm-intel1:amd64\nlibdrm-intel1:i386\nxserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nIt's working fine for me, and with some of the compiz effects.\nI'm using 13.04 but it worked fine in the 12.10 as well. And I actually had some little issue during the migration but not big deal.\n", "Q: Second hard drive not detected I have an old HP Pavilion dv9000 series laptop that I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 on. The laptop is large enough to have two hard drive bays. One has one of the two original Samsung hard drives (it's the primary) and the other has a newer Western Digital Scorpio Blue hard drive. (Both are SATA II by the way.) \nBefore I installed Ubuntu, the Samsung drive had Windows Vista on it and I had formatted the WD drive in NTFS (it's blank right now). So when I first boot Ubuntu, it shows a 250 GB filesystem (the Western Digital drive) in my file browser. But if I click on the link, it gives me an error message saying it had a problem mounting the device. \nThen if I close the file browser and reopen it, the link is gone. I've tried using GParted to find the device, but it doesn't know it's there either. The WD drive doesn't even show up in the list of drives. Is there anything else I can do to get Ubuntu to detect the device?\n\nA: Try the command\ncat /proc/partitions\n\nIt will print a list of physical block devices reported by the kernel like USB memories and attached hard drives. If you can't find your disk there, your disk or secondary controller port is probably broken.\nWith  the command \n dmesg |more\n\nyou might get some more information from the kernel regarding any potential problem.\nIf it does show up there under /proc/partitions, it sounds like it could be some filesystem that bugs out when you try to mount it. Since it's empty, create a filesystem on it:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX\n\nwhere X is the hard drive letter. Make sure to pick the CORRECT disk since this command will erase everything on that drive. \n", "Q: Stuck in broken packages cycle (related to Libreoffice / Openoffice) I have some broken packages after messing up Libreoffice uninstall (I installed Apache Openoffice, but it seems that I didn't fully remove LO first).

LibreOffice - packages. Then \"apply\" this there.\nAfter successfull removing - then close graphical Ubuntu package-manager (synaptic with GUI).\nBetter reboot your Ubuntu-machine.\nBack in terminal you could try to re-extract the downloaded Apache-Office-package.\n\ngunzip Apache_OpenOffice*.tar.gz\n\nthen\n\ntar -xvf Apache_OpenOffice*.tar\n\nThis should work.\nIn case this does not work, then Apache-package could have a bug.\n\nA: I had the EXACT same issue, and after trying all the suggestions to no avail, I created a start-up disk and re-installed Ubuntu (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-ubuntu). Best of all, I didn't lose any of my files, and as far as I know all my settings were restored after I re-installed my programs. So I would go with that if there isn't a better solution. \n", "Q: While running Dwarf Fortress, command line gives me some error about file not found So, I downloaded dwarf fortress linux edition, fired up terminal, decompressed the bz2 (still in the downloads folder), cd ~/Downloads/df_linux, then:\n~/Downloads/df_linux$ ./df\n./df: 6: ./df: ./libs/Dwarf_Fortress: not found\n~/Downloads/df_linux$ cd libs\n~/Downloads/df_linux/libs$ ls -al\ntotal 21408\n-rwx------ 1 ***** ***** 15104448 Jul  29  14:06 Dwarf_Fortress\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ***** *****   466491 Jul  29  14:06 libgcc_s.so.1\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 ***** *****  1451966 Jul  29  14:06 libgraphics.so\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 ***** *****  4852343 Jul  29  14:06 libstdc++.so.6\n~/Downloads/df_linux/libs$\n\nNot found???

Basically, /bin/sh is trying to execute the native binary file libs/Dwarf_Fortress. This is isn't working because the binary file is of the wrong format for your processor (ie, the binary is either in x86 or x64 format and your processor isn't).\nWhat you'll have to do on the Downloads page for DF is click on 'All Versions' and chose the appropriate version for your PC's architecture, or just compile it yourself.\n", "Q: Malware and Backdoor detection Shell Script I'm trying to build a shell script which can automatically detect malware, backdoors and rootkits and I'm trying to research for it.

Can anyone please help me to give a general idea that I can use for the script so that it can do the work of malware, backdoors and rootkits detection. More precisely to say how can one find these malwares, backdoors and rootkits on a ubuntu system. Thanks.\n\nA: You ask about 3 different things...\n\n\n*\n\n*Root kits;\n\n*Backdoors;\n\n*Malware. \n\n\nRoot kits\nMost root kits use the kernel to hide themselves and they are only visible from within the kernel. \nIf you want to know how to find them why not use the power of open source and install rkhunter and see how they do it? You can find the source here.\nBesides that CERT has a thorough explanation on what to look for when dealing with root kits. Highlights from the link:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Examine log files for connections from unusual locations or other unusual activity\n\n*Look for setuid and setgid files (especially setuid root files) everywhere on your system\nfind / -user root -perm -4000 -print\nfind / -group kmem -perm -2000 -print\n\n\n*Check your system binaries to make sure that they haven't been altered.\n\n*Examine all the files that are run by 'cron' and 'at.' \n\n*Check for unauthorized services. \n\n*Examine the /etc/passwd file on the system and check for modifications to that file. \n\n*Check your system and network configuration files for unauthorized entries. \n\n*Look everywhere on the system for unusual or hidden files (files that start with a period and are normally not shown by 'ls').\n\n\nMost of these you can do from command line. \nAlso worth reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/158691/how-to-check-if-a-linux-server-is-clean-from-rootkits-backdoors-botnets-etc\nBackdoors\nThe problem with backdoors is that they generally are flaws in software that get abused. The basic set of rules...\n\n\n*\n\n*immediately install security updates when you're notified;\n\n*do not install antivirus, as you really don't need it in Linux; unless you share files with Windows\n\n*enable the firewall (sudo ufw enable) without further tweaks;\n\n*stick to the official repo's as much as possible, and only deviate from them when strictly necessary and with much caution;\n\n*keep Java (both openJDK and Oracle Java) disabled by default in your browser, and only enable it when needed;\n\n*use Wine with caution;\n\n*and most important of all: use your common sense. The biggest security threat is generally found between keyboard and chair.\n\n\nWorth reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*What to do regarding BackDoor.Wirenet.1\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/171893/how-do-you-search-for-backdoors-from-the-previous-it-person\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9417739/how-to-find-out-backdoor-in-php-source-code\n\n*https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/35944/how-can-i-find-the-malicious-backdoor-codes-without-knowing-the-last-modified-da\n\n*https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/32645/how-can-i-detect-backdoors\nMalware\nScan /etc/hosts for weird IP adresses and host names.

more or less anything on the server side. Judging from your link you use Apache2 as a web server. Check the log files in the /var/log/apache2/ directory, especially the /var/log/apache2/error.log for additional information. \nJust from experience I would say that apache has wrong permissions on the PHPMyAdmin folder. Check that the apache user has reading permission in the /usr/share/phpmyadmin/ folder. \nAlso keep in mind that you need to restart the apache web server after changing its configuration by running service apache2 restart or sudo service apache2 restart.\n\nEdit:\nYou did not change the path to the .htpasswd file in your configuration, which is why this error appears in your log files:\n Could not open password file: /path/to/passwords/.htpasswd\n\nRead through the guide you used again very carefully and change the paths according to your needs.\nI would recommend you move that .htpasswd file into the same directory as the .htaccess. In your terminal type \nsudo mv ~/phpmyadmin_password/.htpasswd /usr/share/phpmyadmin/.htaccess\n\nAfter that update your /usr/share/phpmyadmin/.htaccess file to look like this:\nAuthType Basic\nAuthName \"Restricted Files\"\nAuthUserFile /usr/share/phpmyadmin/.htpasswd\nRequire valid-user\n\nAlso check file ownership and permissions of both files. The apache user should be able to read both these files.\n", "Q: PlayOnLinux error while using Internet Explorer While using Internet Explorer, the browser is getting stuck, and a PlayOnLinux window is appearing with this message: [POL_Wine] Error: Wine seems to have crashed.

I am trying to change a directory to home/developer.\nI used cd home/developer in my shell script.\nAfter executing script it is again coming to original directory,where I executed shell script.\n\nA: When you start your script a new process is created that only inherits your environment. Your current environment stays as it is. You can start your script like this if you want to change the current directory from a script:\n. script.sh\n\nor \nsource script.sh\n\nThe . (source is the long version of .) will evaluate the script in the current environment so it might be altered.\n\nWhen a script is run using source it runs within the existing shell, any variables created or modified by the script will remain available after the script completes. In contrast if the script is run just as script.sh, then a separate subshell (with a completely separate set of variables) would be spawned to run the script.\n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change current directory from a script.\n\n*Source or dot operator.\n\n", "Q: Unable to run bootable drive It won't let me boot up ubuntu on the bootable drives. It just boots from my hdd everytime I select to run from the usb drive.\n\nA: If your BIOS fails to find a bootable drive, typically it will revert to the original boot configuration.  \nWhich boot option are you selecting when selecting your boot device?  USB has three different labels in most BIOS I have used, and you have to use USB-HDD label when selecting a bootable usb. \nIf that doesn't work, try rearranging the boot priority of devices in your BIOS. Add as many devices as possible to the list of bootable devices; and put the HDD with OS installed on it at the bottom of the boot order.  Then when you restart, it will automatically boot from anything other than the HDD if possible.  But you gotta remember to change it back later!\n", "Q: Slow FX/Unity perfomance in a Intel(r)915G/915GV/910GL Graphics, can be improved? Since I upgraded Ubuntu to 13.04, last Friday, FX on Unity is very slow.\nThis is a pretty annoying issue, because everything has an FX: Launcher menu, Appl.

Did you manage to fix it eventually?\n12.10 worked perfectly, but 13.04 uses different driver (Gallium 0.4). Also to avoid black screen, I need to boot with \"nomodeset\" or \"i915.modeset=0\", and I read that Mesa 2.1 and up has problem with that. It needs KMS.\nEDIT:\nSolved it. Turns out it's trivial issue. Yes, the nomodeset thing messes with graphics driver causing 3D acceleration not to work. The only reason I was using nomodeset was to fix the black screen. Turns out completely unnecessarily. I boot normally, get 'black screen' ...and fix that by hitting Fn+F5 (aka. brightness up button). :)\nNow 13.04 is running fast with 3D acceleration.\n", "Q: How do I disable adobe flash \"hardware acceleration\" in terminal I can't uncheck the box for settings to disable hardware acceleration in Flash. Can it be done in terminal or in Firefox somehow?\n\nA: Their are two ways you can disable hardware acceleration for flash, the terminal way is to create a file called /etc/adobe/mms.cfg and add the following line:\nEnableLinuxHWVideoDecode=0\n\nThe 2nd method I would recommend is opening a youtube video and going into full screen, right-clicking Settings and unticking Enable Hardware Acceleration.\nIf by some chance it doesn't let you untick, use the tab key to move between the buttons and press Space to do it for you.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 13.04 w/ Win 7 I just got a new solid state hard drive (Samsung SSD 840 Pro) and am trying to install Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.04. I'm coming across the known issue of Ubuntu not recognizing the Windows partition, and Windows not being able to work with the Ubuntu filesystem.\nHere are some things that I've tried and the associated problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Windows 7 first, and then trying to install Ubuntu. I have exactly the same issue as this person (ie, nautilus sees Windows and I can mount, but gparted thinks the entire drive is unallocated). Unfortunately the accepted solution basically only says \"use gdisk\" - if anyone could give step-by-step directions it would be much appreciated.\n\n*Installing Ubuntu first, making sure to generate an NTFS partition for Windows (and of course a swap and boot partition). In this case Windows does see all of the partitions, but claims that it can't install on the NTFS partition. I don't remember the error off the top of my head (and I currently have Win7 installed, so no way to check) but it was along the lines of the filesystem being wrong. The error was only one sentence and seemed fairly generic.\nLet me know if any terminal output would be helpful.

You need to remove backup gpt data on drive so it is only MBR.\nFixParts is the easiest way to remove the stray GPT data. GPT fdisk (gdisk or sgdisk) can do it, but the procedure's a bit more involved.\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/\nIf system is UEFI and you really want that you have to convert Windows 7 installer to flash and make it UEFI capable.

I am trying to simultaneously run multiple instances of my application from terminal on remote ubuntu server. Single terminal is required for running a single instance of application. I am accessing remote server through putty and ultravnc viewer. \nEvery time there is a network issue in my local machine(which has windows 7 as OS), application running through putty gets abruptly terminated with a message network error which is understandable. It wastes my time as i have to run application again and again from starting.\nBy using ultra vnc viewer, application runs independently of network issue in my local setup. But i can run my application only through single terminal. When i try to execute multiple instances of vnc viewer, it shows same terminal.\nI want to work on multiple terminals via vnc viewer.\n\nA: I think Tmux would be a nice solution to your problem. It is a terminal multiplexer. \n\nWhat is a terminal multiplexer? It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.\n\nScreen is another option. This binary ships with Ubuntu by default. \nI prefer Tmux above Screen. Tmux can split screens, has a statusbar and support Vi like key bindings which, for as far as I know, Screen does not support.\n", "Q: Why I am unable to update Ubuntu anymore using the Update Manager?

For some reason after that, I had to uninstall Ubuntu. Now, I want to install it forever, but I wonder about what is the difference between Wibu and liveCD/USB download? \nI read the instructions and I see that downloading by CD/USB is really hard, there are partitions, for example, which I even don't know what they are (English is not my native language :( )  and it is really easy to download with Wubi.\nI just want to know, which is the best way to install Ubuntu?\nthanks advance.\n\nA: The Windows installer I only used it once. I believe it is designed to run in Windows and let you demo Ubuntu, or install it beside Windows, giving you a dual boot with Windows boot manager in control by default.  I don't think it lets you install Ubuntu overtop of Windows.\nThe live CD/USB install has two versions.  The regular version is a user friendly installer with a graphical interface, kind of like the Windows installer disk.  \nThe alternate CD/USB installer, which ends the name of the file with 'alternate.iso' is a technical installer, with advanced features available.  I recommend you download, and prepare both images on disk, in case the standard, graphical installer ever fails you, or you need the advanced features available only on the alternate version, such as improved partition management, which is the only feature I've ever needed it for.\nIf you want to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu, use the WUBI installer.\nIf you use the Live CD/USB (or alternate installer) you can reformat your hard drive and install Ubuntu alone, or manage your partitions and dual boot.\n", "Q: How can I install Geforce 310M drivers Raring Ringtail?

I know there are other packages that do auto update, but I'm just looking for a simple solution to turn it back on.\n\nA: The unattended-upgrades package can be used to automatically install updated packages, and can be configured to update all packages or just install security updates. First, install the package by entering the following in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades\n\nTo configure unattended-upgrades, edit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades and adjust the following to fit your needs:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {\n        \"Ubuntu precise-security\";\n//      \"Ubuntu precise-updates\";\n};\n\nCertain packages can also be blacklisted and therefore will not be automatically updated. To blacklist a package, add it to the list:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist {\n//      \"vim\";\n//      \"libc6\";\n//      \"libc6-dev\";\n//      \"libc6-i686\";\n};\n\nThe double “//” serve as comments, so whatever follows \"//\" will not be evaluated.\nTo enable automatic updates, edit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic and set the appropriate apt configuration options:\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\";\nAPT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"1\";\nAPT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"7\";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\";\n\nThe above configuration updates the package list, downloads, and installs available upgrades every day. The local download archive is cleaned every week.\nThe results of unattended-upgrades will be logged to /var/log/unattended-upgrades.\nSource - The official Ubuntu Server documentation.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/automatic-updates.html\n", "Q: User: 1000-user#1000 My hard disk (boot sector) is blown but the partition with my data in is good.\nWhen I loasd up Ubuntu 13:05 LiveDisk, and move to my data partition, I notice that I have no access to the files and the permissions say that the files are owned by \nUser: 1000-user#1000\nOK, I found \"Ubuntu Hardware Partitions: How to Set Ownership of Drive or Partition (Internal & External Hard Disks)\" Followed the instructions very carefully but the system would not recognise 1000-user#1000 - it may have been the hash sign it doesn't like?\nCan anyone shed some light on this as I would like to get my data back before dumping the hard drive.\nIf it is any help.

It is not available in Live Environment.\nYou should be able to open the hardrive as root with no problems (except you encrypted your home partition).\nOpen Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), open nautilus as root (sudo nautilus), then open your mounted partition.\nOr if you work with Terminal only change to root with \"su -i\" and to your task, afterwards \"exit\" to exit the root modus.\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: Will Canonical disable Amazon (and similar) lenses by default I'm using 12.04 LTS, partially because it's stable and I need my machine to be stable and reliable. I also don't wont to switch to newer versions of Ubuntu because of shopping lenses. If I decide  to install newer version of Linux I'll go for Linux Mint Debian Edition. I know that this lenses can be disabled or completely removed, but it makes me frustrated. Linux was once famous for speed, stability and security, now Canonical drives Ubuntu off that course. I also understand that these lenses can be useful to someone, but at least ask us (users) about that on first start-up. Or even better disable it by default.\nAlso, even if I want to keep that feature, I don't want them all in one. I mean, if I want to search my local files I don't want to search the internet at the same time. I know this can also be tweaked, but why not make it default?\nI also decided not to support Ubuntu Edge because of this.\nSo, may question is : Will Canonical disable Amazon (and similar) lenses by default in some future releases?\nThis question is also appeal for Canonical, please hear your users!\nPlease make it configurable as possible. Make detailed options for what is searched by default when I press Super (is it local files, apps, amazon, facebook etc or some combination of them).\nThen it would be really great.\n(Sorry for that proposal at the end, I don't know how to address to Canonical other way.)\n\nA: If you ask me, I don't believe, that those features will be disabled in the future. For that reason they are there, and Canonical thinks they are convenient. Most users don't bother, or think they are positive.\nIf you don't think so, you might change distro. There are many good distros with another philosophy and not ALL Linux Distros have to say a loud NO to business. I think that's not fair.\nWell, I uninstall those lenses and do also some other things to protect myself against advertising and data collection.\n", "Q: How to remove Windows and GRUB problem At the moment I have Ubuntu and Windows 7 installed on my hard drive. Since I don't want to split my memory I want to remove Windows, but I have no idea how to do it since I am new to Linux. \nAnother problem I had after installing Ubuntu was that the GRUB bootloader didn't work so I googled for a bit of advice, and now I think I have an older version of GRUB. Is there a way to update it?\nThis is how my drive looks like at the moment:\n\n\nA: The first thing you should do is to back up any files you want to keep from the My Documents Folder.\nYou may need to repair your GRUB which can be done by following these guidelines\nNext, in gparted, the programme you used in your screen shot in your question, Right click on the Windows 7 partition /dev/sda2 and select unmount next right click on the same partition and select delete to remove the partition. This will completely wipe windows ad ALL files on the windows partition\nNow you will have a blank space on your hard disk where Windows used to be. Next you will want to resize the partition with Ubuntu on it to reclaim the unused disk space.\nI have never done this, so you may need to format it first.

I had the following scenarios:\n\n1. I downloaded only wubi.exe and ran it.  \nThe wubi installer started downloading the amd64.iso using torrent. But when there were just about 40 secs left to download, it shows an error 404: File not found.    \n\n2. I downloaded the iso file seperately and put it in the same folder as the wubi.exe. Now there are two cases:  \n\n  a. Offline: wubi says it could not download the metalinks file and hence cannot download the iso.\nSo I download the meta files separately and place them in the same directory. wubi shows the same error again. \n\n  b. Online: wubi works in same way as in case 1. and the same problem occurs as in case 1.  \nIn short wubi doesn't recognize the already downloaded iso in the directory at all.  \n\n3. I burn the iso into a Cd and run it. The same thing occurs as in Case 2.\n\nJust in case that you know, I installed SP3 for win XP just before using wubi. While Windows is running alright, is it possible that its causing conflicts for wubi?\n\nA: I also have 12.04 alongside Ubuntu in my Windows XP, and I've also encountered same errors while trying to use Wubi\nI guess that wubi failed in locating the .iso installation file.

If you have a flash drive in your system, the sdc could be the drive which will slow down your system if it's usb 2.0. You can move your linux OS to one drive and your windows os to another drive. Remember, the swap works best outside of the extended partition. \nAt the least, you can use prelink (sudo apt-get install prelink) to have your system to link all of the mount points before boot up.

I do not know that, but some do use it. It has to compromise grub2's boot loader to work. You have to force grub2 to install into a partition's boot sector (PBR) which means it uses blocklists or hard coded addresses to find the rest of grub in the install. If any of those files are updated then the address may be wrong & you have to reinstall grub. \nBut you have to install Ubuntu's grub2 boot loader to the PBR of Ubuntu and Kubuntu's to the PBR of Kubuntu. (actually only one required as either grub will offer to boot everything.)\nIf you really want EasyBCD:\nhttp://neosmart.net/wiki/display/EBCD/Ubuntu\nWhichever install you install last is the boot loader that goes into the MBR of the hard drive and will be the one used to boot.

I have just installed ubuntu 12.04.2, but can't figure out how mount my sd card reader and flash drives to transfer files. \nI am New to this having used Windows since the beginning of time. I have figured most other problems I have come across but I am stumped with this. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: Most SD card readers, SD cards and flash drives are recognized by Ubuntu as soon as you plug them in. Most SD cards and flash drives are also automatically mounted by Ubuntu as soon as you plug them in. If the device is mounted, then an icon for that device will appear in the Launcher. To browse the folders and files on a device, just click on the device's icon in the Launcher.\nIt is also possible to easily safely remove a portable device if it is mounted similarly to the way you would do it in Windows using an application in the Ubuntu Software Center called ejecter. Ejecter is a simple menu that sits in the system notification area, providing you a quick way to unmount an external peripheral device such as USB flash drive, CD/DVD disk, external hard disk and so on. To safely remove a portable device click on the Ejector icon in the notification area, select the device that you want to safely remove from the Ejecter menu and then you will see a popup notification telling you that you can safely remove the portable device.\nAlternatively if you don't want to install Ejecter you can simply right-click on the device in the default file manager and select \"Safely Remove Drive\" as shown. \nUpdate for Ubuntu 14.04\nYou no longer need to install Ejecter in Ubuntu 14.04. Instead just right-click the portable device's icon in the Launcher and select Safely remove.\n\n\nA: I just got an external card reader for my Ubuntu machine and my stepdad gave me a tip, unplug the card reader from the computer, insert the card, then plug in the card reader and the memory card will mount.

Once they are formatted, it becomes difficult to decide which one belongs to whom.  Is there anything unique about pen drives like firmware kind of thing which can establish their unique identity? If so, how can it be discovered?  Is it possible to update/modify the firmware to give it a unique personal unique identity.\n\nA: Try running\nsudo blkid\n\non the command line while more than one being plugged in. The partition/volume should have a unique identifier.\nAlternatively, you could also use the device serial, if provided by the manufacturer.\nRun lsusb -vvv and identify the device, then look for the iSerial field, e.g.:\nBus 004 Device 005: ID 059f:1049 LaCie, Ltd rikiki Harddrive\nDevice Descriptor:\n  bLength                18\n  [...]\n  iManufacturer           2 LaCie\n  iProduct                3 Rikiki USB 3\n  iSerial                 1 00000000d49425f030b6\n  [...]\n\n\nA: You could give each drive a label. Most filesystems support labelling and you're most likely using FAT32 or EXT3/4 which both do. When a partition has a label, Ubuntu will use that to identify the mount.\nIn both cases you'll want to unmount (not eject) each device before you start and replace /dev/sdxN with the actual partition name and my_label with whatever you want to call it. I would avoid spaces for safety.\nFor FAT32\nsudo mlabel -i /dev/sdxN ::my_label\n\nFor EXT{2..4}\nsudo e2label /dev/sdxN my_label\n\nAnd if you're not a fan of the command-line, install GParted and use that.

This need to be done from either the Ubuntu LiveCD, or Gparted LiveCD, since the drive has to be unmounted.  Once you boot from the CD, and run Gparted, you can re-size /dev/sda1 to what you want, and once done, you will have some unallocated space for you to use.\nRight click on /dev/sda1 unmount first, and then re-size, as shown in the image below.\n\n\nA: GParted won't let you modify partitions that are currently in use -- that's why all of your partitions have key icons next to them, to indicate that they're locked. You need to boot with another disk (a live CD or USB flash drive), such as the Ubuntu installer. Booted in this way, most or all of your partitions will be unused and so will be modifiable.

IE. I can run it 10 times and 5 times I will have keyboard and mouse, and 5 times I will have to unplug and replug the dongle (once or twice).\nThe other thing I tried was, #1 the startup script, and #2 also a cronjob that would run every minute to run those commands, after 10 minutes, I didn't have keyboard or mouse.  However when I rebooted and left the computer on over night, I had keyboard and mouse in the morning.\nDoes anyone know a reliable solution for this?

To run gthumb you need to log in and run additional programs in the background, a graphical front end (X) at a minimum. You can use a minimal graphical front end such as fluxbox.\nTo be honest, IMO the easiest option might be to use the guest account. This has the advantage of being secured by apparmor, although it allows more access then what you want.\nIf that fails you can either use a custom apparmor profile or use a chroot/jail. These options will give you more control, but at the expense of you having to identify all the underlying applications and libraries that you need to allow to run a graphical front end and gthumb.\nSee: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9799756&postcount=5\nOr Simple & easy way to jail users\n", "Q: Lubuntu on Powerbook G4 not booting Trying the alternate install CD for Lubuntu 12.10 for PowerPC on an old Powerbook G4.

If you installed Ubuntu from a live CD there should have been 3 options \"Install alongside Windows\" \"Replace Windows\" or \"Something Else\". If you select \"Replace Windows\" (not verbatim) then the installation will use you entire hardrive, Destroying Windows while doing so.\n", "Q: Install ubuntu on 128GB SSD or 3TB SATA disk? sorry for the silly question; for gaming/heavy programs on Ubuntu (PlayOnLinux, Wine, Steam etc.) and given the amount up updates that come and go plus, I am - at least under the impression that you cannot chose where programs are installed as much as you would be able to on Windows (with wizard installations) am I wrong? So with that in mind where would you suggest I install Ubuntu and why?\nEdit (more background):\nI ask because I have previously had issues with /boot being full from several kernels + initrd (I fixed this) and also because already on this machine my SSD is at 60% use according to df -h and I am not that experienced yet with GNU/Linux so I though I would ask here.\n\nA: I'd put everything except /home, /tmp and /var on the SSD. The other folders are only written to when installing or updating software, yet they keep nearly all the files required to start programs (binaries, libraries, configuration files). Therefore putting them on the SSD will yield greatly improved performance, while the low amount of writes will keep the wear on the SSD low. Also, mount all filesystems on the SSD with the noatime mount option to reduce write access (which would put unnecessary wear on the SSD and is much slower than read, causing worse performance). If you think you don't need a filesystem journal, use a non-journalling filesystem like ext2 on the SSD.\nMy partition layout suggestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot: 2 GB on SSD, ext2\n\n*/: rest of SSD, ext2 should be safe, but if you want faster disk checks, use ext4 or xfs. Corruption is highly unlikely, since only few writes are performed\n\n*/tmp: tmpfs, 16 GB (you'll need swap of at least that size), OR, if you want to burn blu-rays: 200 GB on HDD\n\n*swap: 32 GB on HDD (since /tmp is tmpfs, and you might also want hibernate). If you use a non-ramdrive /tmp, swap can be smaller, but at least the size of the RAM.\n\n*/var: 5 GB on HDD (should never get that big, just to be on the safe side...)\n\n*/home: rest of HDD \n\n\nSince WINE is installing prefixes per default in the home folder, you then have plenty of space for games. Nevertheless, you can of course in addition create a folder on the SSD that is owned by your user (for instance in /opt), to which you can install your games by setting the WINEPREFIX environment variable. It is anyhow good practice to install each game in a different WINEPREFIX.\n\nA: \nsorry for the silly question; for gaming/heavy programs on Ubuntu\n  (PlayOnLinux, Wine, Steam etc.) and given the amount up updates that\n  come and go plus, I am - at least under the impression that you cannot\n  chose where programs are installed as much as you would be able to on\n  Windows (with wizard installations) am I wrong?\n\nYou can certainly choose where to install software.  There are guidelines about where things in the system should go, and for most packages in repository these are adhered to, but since you brought up games and playonlinux, let's use that as an example.  \nPlayonlinux lets you install things in different winedrives by manipulating environment variables, so you can definitely choose where to install things (even moreso than Windows Steam for example).  Binary installer games almost always either a) install to opt or b) install in user-home/.something.  You could install it as any user you want, with any home directory you want.  So again, yes, able to be manipulated.  \nIs it exposed as a next next finish interface?  No.  Why not?  Because you would break things since Linux is all about the shared libraries and Windows is all about monolithic or using their runtimes (how many games ask if you installed directx of the dotnet)\n\nSo with that in mind where would you suggest I install Ubuntu and why?\n\nIt's generally accepted knowledge that a desirable configuration is either starting fresh with bcache for low resource systems or using the SSD for high read/write speed required areas (your /home mountpoint for example).  \n\nA: bcache is a good option for SSD caching, so that the cache takes care of deciding what data will be on the SSD.  See these questions to get started:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and use flashcache/bcache to cache HDD to SSD?\n\n*Is it possible to use BCache on my main Ubuntu disk?\n", "Q: Screen Sharing Behind Firewall I've setup my brother's computer with Ubuntu.

Windows 8, which was pre-installed, worked fine and without issue (aside from, y'know, being Windows 8).\nInitially I found that I was unable to get the LiveCD to load when selecting \"Try Ubuntu\" only a black screen. The backlight was on and the laptop gave signs of life, but nothing. Eventually by adding \"nomodeset\" or \"i915.enable=0\" (presumably this was disabling the load of the i915 driver since there is no such flag) I was able to view the system as it attempted to load and would apparently lock up once x tried to start. Removing \"quiet\" and \"splash\" revealed a bit more data, but nothing conclusive. Most of the time ctrl-alt-del or pressing the power button would register so the system wasn't hard-locked. Unlike other issues I was never seeing \"no monitor found\" or getting a blinking cursor. \nEventually it was found that going into the \"Install Ubuntu\" option with \"i915.enable=0\" worked perfectly. All of the widgets appeared properly and I was able to install normally. Since this is essentially an X environment I thought the problem might be fixable and installed 13.04 reformatting the entire drive in the process.\nUpon booting, however, the previous behavior resumed. The BIOS logo screen and grub would display properly and some text after grub would briefly flash past, but as soon as it attempted to go into graphical mode it just went to a black, backlit screen. After some work graphical Plymouth was removed and replaced with the text version and the system would boot fully. Setting CapsLock or such and then swapping between terminals showed that the switching was occurring properly. Most surprising though it was found that if an external monitor was connected to either the HDMI or VGA ports the both displays would come to life regardless of whether the external monitor was on or off. The HDMI connection initially could be removed and the laptop display would still function, but on the second time testing this it no longer worked. Connecting to VGA would still work and would leave the laptop screen on after it was disconnected. If the external monitor was connected during boot this would not work and if the system was suspended the process would need to be repeated, but would work. Either way aside from the display issue the system appears to be booting properly into X and nothing else has shown any problems.\nI've been pulling my hair out over this issue for about a week with little idea what is causing it or how to fix it. I've been through just about everything else that AskUbuntu or anything else I've found online has suggested as an answer to little avail (or, at least it only got me this far).

I suspect there is something wrong with the drivers because on windows there is no problem. Also I have checked there are no interferences or anything else. Any idea how to troubleshoot this?\nThanks in advance,\nMarios\n\nA: After I installed good firmware From the DD-WRT wiki to drive the Broadcom chip in my Linksys wifi-router, I have had no more issues like the ones you speak of with my rtl8188 using the rtl8192ce driver. I first had to flash this, poor performing, [E2500 Trailed Initial Flash Build][1], before I could upgrade the firmware from the next link ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2012/06-08-12-r19342/broadcom_K26/dd-wrt.v24-19342_NEWD-2_K2.6_big-nv60k.bin. Like you, I've never had an issue using windows 7 on the same hardware. It turns out there's a bug with Broadcom chips using linux sometimes. Remember, there are at least two drivers from two separate cpu's involved in a wifi setup. I didn't even consider that until it was fixed.

I want to make a shortcut/link to my Windows XP hard drive and put in the documents folder under home/*.\n\nA: That's quite easy. Right click on Folder or file and select \"make shortcut\". Afterwards drag and drop it to the location you want to have it.\nThe difficulty is, that after reboot the partition won't be loaded again. All your shortcuts will be messed up. You have to mount the partition permanently. See here:\nHow to mount partition permanently? \n\nA: It is best not to directly read & write into Windows system partitions. Eventually they seem to complain. Most of us suggest a separate NTFS shared data partition. Then you can mount the XP partition as read only in fstab and mount the data partition as read/write. With a permanent mount then you can link the data partition or folders from the data partition into your /home.\nExample read only\nUUID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx /WinC ntfs defaults,noauto,ro,umask=227 0 0\n\nFor ntfs UUID shown is example only see below:\nUUID=XXXXXXXXXXX   /media/WinD ntfs defaults,nls=utf8,umask=000,uid=1000,windows_names 0 0\n\nWindow_names prevents the use of invalid windows characters:\n(which are the nine characters ” * / : < > ? \\ | and those whose code is less than 0×20) \nuid=1000 should fix the trash problems as well:\nsudo blkid -c /dev/null -o list\nsudo mkdir /media/WinD\nsudo mkdir /WinC\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nAnd when you are done editing fstab and saving it run the following command to test for errors and mount the partitions without requiring a reboot. You will know before you reboot if something is amiss. Make sure you have partition unmounted if prevously mounted:\nsudo mount -a\n\nThen from your /home you can link a folder in your WinD mount.\nln -s /media/WinD/SomeFolder\n", "Q: Can't get full resolution with Dell U3011 monitor Can't get full resolution with the Dell U3011 monitor. \nThe machine is a Lenovo M92p which has integrated graphics (HD 4000).\nThe OS is ubuntu 13.10.\nAny idea how to get the full resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels?\nThe choices in the control panel for Displays only get up to 1920 x 1200\n\nA: \nIntel graphics does not support dual-link, therefore 1920x1200 is the\nmaximum for DVI and HDMI, 2560x1440 is only possible with a\ndisplayport port.

I have recently made the switch from windows to Linux, and am still trying to learn my way around this beautiful OS.

Is there something I did wrong configuring my system that would cause this problem?\nThanks in advance for your patience.\n\nA: Maybe you have only main-repository enabled.\nOpen Dash (Windows key), type Preferences, open them, search for Software. On the first tab you can enable Ubuntu software (main repository, universe, multiverse). There are also other repositories, for example playdeb. Playdeb offers some good games, which are not included in the Ubuntu-repositories. \nIf you have all ubuntu repositories enabled, maybe it is just a spelling problem.

I have a non-root solution here which I will try later - How do I mount a drive so that it is readable by me?\n\nA: To run a command as root, use sudo command. (You may want to read this to learn more.)\nSo: sudo mount -t vboxf ...\nCreating the Mount Point for the Share\nIf you mount the share at /media/sharename, that directory must first exist. To create it, run:\nsudo mkdir /media/sharename\n\nYou can mount shares anywhere; they do not have to be mounted in /media. However, these days it's common for filesystems mounted as root, especially if they may be attached and detached, to have subfolders of /media as their mount points.\nThe more traditional place to put mount points is /mnt. Either way--or elsewhere--will work.\nLetting a Normal User Access and Change the Contents of the Share\nIf the host OS doesn't use a Unix-style filesystem--for example, if you have a Windows host running an Ubuntu guest--then you might want to specify what user you intend to give full access to the files in the share. Otherwise modifying the files (and possibly accessing them at all) will require you to act as root. You probably don't want that; you probably want to mount the share as root, but be able to access its contents as a non-rot user.\nTo do that, include uid=1000 in the ,-separated list of options issued after -o:\n\n*\n\n*If that's the only option you're specifying, no comma is required. Otherwise, all options should be separated with commas, and no spaces.\n\n*Replace 1000 with your actual user ID. If you're the first user created on your Ubuntu system (the user created during installation), typically your user ID is 1000. To find out your user ID, run the command id -u in the Ubuntu system.\n\n\nA: When you have the correct permissions use: sudo mount -t vboxsf [-o OPTIONS] sharedFolderName mountPoint.\nFrom the sudo man page:\n\nsudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user\n\n", "Q: Stream Audio on the lan to output on Wifi enabled speakers Seems I can use VLC to put out an audio stream on the Lan. What do I need to look for in a cheap speaker that will receive the audio signal over wifi and transform and output acoustically. Or is it not that simple? Googling leads me to pricey devices or very difficult build your speaker type hacks, and I'd think this would be pretty straightforward and don't want (can't lol) spend a lot of money. Any guidance will be appreciated and I will write up my successes when I come out the other side.\nUpdate:\nSo it seems that it isn't so simple -- sending audio data over the lan to a wifi speaker-- because that's only the half of it..the speaker has to be configured to accept and process the data stream, which means that some protocol needs to determine the format for the data packets for the server to serve and for the speaker node to process and output the acoustic signal. Therein lies the rub and the reason why everywhere you turn the talk is all about proprietary formats and hardware. So I guess my question is what server can I use to send audio data in what format to what type of speaker if I am looking to do this on the cheap.  \n\nA: There are probably a few options. Two big ones I can think of.\n1. DLNA\nFirst the simple option. If the goal is just to play music from the network just setup a DLNA Server (install mediatomb) on your server and buy a player that can stream from a DLNA server. Almost any network media player you can buy from the local hifi shop.\n2. Raspberry PI with PulseAudio\nNow, if you're after something a bit more advanced. A project I've wanted to try is to get a raspberry pi (~$40 inc. case) and setup raspbian with pulse audio install on it. Plug the RPi into your amp or speakers and use pulseaudio's built in network support to stream the audio over the network.\nA walkthrough that someone else has done that I will probably try out:\nhttp://rootprompt.apatsch.net/2013/02/20/raspberry-pi-network-audio-player-pulseaudio-dlna-and-bluetooth-a2dp-part-1-pulseaudio/\nBear in mind the raspberry pi's audio isn't meant to be that good when using the analog output (3.5mm jack) but it's great if you use the HDMI output or usb sound.\n\nA: The audio streaming you can set up very much depends on the capabilities of your sound receiver. Of course we need to send our data using a supported audio protocol.\nDLNA\nIn case your receiver supports DLNA this is quite an easy method to remotely access your audio library from the receiver. This then will be similar to accessing your files on your hard drive. I made best experience with MiniDLNA.\nPulseaudio RTP\nIn case we can run Pulseaudio on the receiver side we can directly stream audio files using the inbuilt RTP streaming protocol. This will lead to quite heavy network loads.\nIcecast2\nTo be able to stream the audio output from our sound card to another device in the network setting up an Icecast radio server is quite a nice solution. Many devices capable of receiving an Internet Radio stream will be able to tune in.\n\nA: I have successfully built ffmpeg on the Raspberry Pi 2 using the support site's instructions for building with Ubuntu.  I successfully used ffmpeg and ffserver to play audio wirelessly with the RPI.  I can store audio files on the RPI and use ssh to play the files from the RPI's audio jack and HDMI through any computer on my network.  I can use either the ethernet port or an external Wifi Dongle. I am still in the process of streaming audio from a laptop soundcard to the RPI for playing audio wirelessly.\n", "Q: Detect if Radiance or Ambiance is the current look To interactively change icon colors, I want my program to be able to detect whether Ambiance or Radiance is the current looks. \nI found this  value to be stored in dconf-editor under org->gnome->desktop->interface->gtk-theme. \nWhere is the file from which my program can read this value?\n\nA: You can read information with the dconf command.

I'm running on pre-installed Windows 8 and even though I'm able to install Ubuntu (13.04) and boot it by setting it as the primary boot option from BIOS, I'm unable to perform a clean dual boot (the Windows dual boot screen doesn't show up, instead it just boots to Windows if boot manager is set as the primary boot option).\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*EasyBCD, no luck with it. I get a screen asking for Windows installation CD with this option.\n\n*Boot-repair. I used ubuntu boot repair from a live session. It corrupted the booting totally; I got booted to grub resque (\"something too small\" (not sure about the exact message) when booting Windows, unknown filesystem when booting the Ubuntu). I had to change the boot to my LiveUSB and uninstall Ubuntu with Os-Uninstall in order to get Win8 operational.\n\n\nHere's the paste that Boot-Repair created:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5926812/\n\nA: Your sda8 looks like a left over encrypted swap from your previous install. You should not need EasyBCD with UEFI as each system installs its boot files into the efi partition as a separate folder and you can boot every install directly from UEFI if necessary. \nIf you run Boot-Repair more than once it renames the Windows boot file. Some systems have (incorrectly) modified UEFI to only boot bootmfgw.efi or only boot Windows. The work around is to back up the Windows file and rename shim to have that name as shim has the Microsoft signing key. But you only need the rename if you can only boot Windows from UEFI menu.\nIf you can (or after other fixes can) boot Ubuntu, you can run unrename the Windows file.\nBoot-Repair - Updated Jan 1, 2013 to not rename first time, but rename if first time Windows does not boot.

It now bypasses Grub and goes straight in to Windows as UEFI default.\nYou do show grub installed and if you boot ubuntu entry from UEFI menu with secure boot off, does it boot? You may get grub menu, but also need boot parameters if you have video issues. If you can only boot with secure boot on, then you need to use Boot-Repair to add the secure boot versions of the kernel which you have not installed.\nGrub2 has a bug in os-prober and does not create correct chain load entries. It creates the old BIOS entries that will not work with UEFI. Boot-Repair normally adds a 25_custom with correct entries, but did not (yet?) create those for you.

As an Ubuntu 13.04 user I had myself as well various problems and incompatibilities with this newest version of Ubuntu. One of these is that the Brightness bar has suddenly disappeared from the 'System Settings --> Brightness & Lock' tab after I installed some packages (which I don't really remember what it was). I found out that a workaround is to use xbacklight.\nAs an exercise for myself, I wrote a short script in order to easily increase and decrease the brightness using xbacklight from terminal. The script is executable (has permission to execute), is an a directory that is included in $PATH in my .bashrc file and is linked to an alias ('blup' to increase and 'bldn' to decrease screen brightness). So, my two aliases (blup/bldn) work perfectly fine from a terminal line. Next, I wanted to link these to some keyboard shortcuts (for instance F2/F3). I did so in \n'System Settings --> Keyboard --> Shortcuts --> Custom Shortcuts', but it did not work.\n\nWhy?\nFurthermore, is there a way to 'discover' where and how other (non-custom) keyboard-shortcut commands are executed? For instance, the volume-up shortcut what terminal line does it execute, what alias is connected to (if any) and what directory are they put at (/usr/bin, something else...)?\nAs a newbie in script-writing I would appreciate any kind of help!\nThanks\nP.S.1 Of course, simply one can paste the command 'xbacklight -inc/-dec 10' to the custom keyboard shortcuts and it will work fine. I just want to seize the opportunity and get to know a bit more about script writing and executing.\nP.S.2 My problem is not the same as this one: How do I launch a bash script using a keyboard shortcut?, ie, I use no '~/' for '/home/user/'.\n\nA: First of all, aliases are not expanded in non-interactive shells. Read the ALIASES section from man bash in this sense. So, you can't use an alias in 'Command' field when you add/edit a custom shortcut.\nSecond, as geirha said in this comment, if you changed PATH in .bashrc file, that change will not be available in non-interactive shells. So, you need to change the PATH in ~/.profile file instead.\nThird, if you still want to use only bldn in 'Command' field when you add/edit a custom shortcut, you can rename your script with this name and add the script path to the PATH in ~/.profile file, as I said above.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 Dark Screen on Live Pendrive I have a 2-3 year old gateway laptop that I wiped the hard drive to.

I have an external hard drive and installed Ubuntu 13.04 on it. I have a Samsung ATIV Book 8 running windows 8. When I go to boot, I get the Grub menu and can boot into both windows or ubuntu. However, If I unplug the Hard Drive, a Grub menu appears asking me to find the media to boot. How can I set it up so without the hard drive it just boots to windows?\n\nA: In your case, GRUB is installed on internal HDD, and it's files are on external. It is BAD. You have to install GRUB on external HDD and Windows MBR on internal. Then set up GRUB entry in Windows. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug external HDD, boot from it into Ubuntu and run command:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\n\nwhere /dev/sdb is your external hard drive.\n\n*Unplug external HDD (for safety), reboot and run Windows installation DVD or Windows Repair CD. You can make one while you have Windows loaded.\n\n*Open command prompt and run:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nOther instructions recommend also run bootrec /fixboot, but in my case it just clears BCD store (so I cannot boot anywhere), so you should run it only if you have problems with booting into Windows.\n\n*Plug external HDD and boot into Windows. From there, run EasyBCD and set up GRUB entry for your external HDD. This should be easy. If not, there is instruction.\n\n\nAfter this, you can boot from both internal and external HDDs. Other way is to move /boot partition onto your internal HDD and use GRUB, but it is a little bit more complicated solution.\n", "Q: Chrome won't start I upgraded Ubuntu to 12.04.\nI can't launch Chrome from the taskbar, even though it's the most recent version. In the taskbar, the icon is grayed out with a question mark.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: There is an issue like this posted here.\nTo sum up the issue, it could be one of three things:\n1.A bug in BAMF (the application matching framework mentioned above).\n2.A faulty application description (aka '.desktop' file).\n3.The lack of any application description at all. Executables that launch windows do not inherently have this metadata.\nThis issue is directly related to Unity's framework.\nI can't sum it up very well, but if you go to the link above it has a thorough explanation of the issue.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu memmory consumption problem Ubuntu Gnome on my laptop boot up using about 310 MB Ram. When running couples of program, the system takes 700 to 900 MB. Then, I close all programs, Ram usage drops but it keeps at 450 ~ 600 MB Ram. Why doesn't it drop to the initial status as booting up. How can I make the system to release Ram automatically when all programs are closed.\n\nA: Linux uses RAM a little differently to some other operating systems by keeping as much in RAM as it can at all times, my 4GB server often reports 3.5GB of RAM used, but no SWAP in use and runs fast. What I would watch for is when the system starts to use swap, this is normally mounted to your physical disk so is much slower than RAM.\n\nA: Actually memory releasing depends on how you are trying to use your Ubuntu. For example If I am using my Ubuntu only for multimedia purpose means I can quickly release the memory after closing the applications.\nIf I am using my Ubuntu as a server with installed applications like Databases,web serves then They will run in the background even you quit them. Some browsers will keep running in background even after you close them to give the fast opening next time when you click at that.\nSo what I am trying to say is first find out what are the applications eating up your RAM. you can use command-line tools and as well as GUI tools to do that.\nthe best are\n\n*\n\n*System-monitor(GUI based)\n\n*top (Command Line)\n\n*htop (command Line)\n\nIn your Unity dash type as system-monitor and you will have an application which can help you to monitor what are the applications eating your memory.\nIf you want command line tools you can use top and htop.Htop not pre installed but you can install it with\nsudo apt-get install htop\n\nSystem-monitor looks like \ntop looks like\n\nhtop looks like \nhope that helps.\n", "Q: not what I expected from shred - help to interpret output I have a windoz xp disk that got infected by a virus, a particularly nasty one that hides in a gazillion places and 'activates' on many actions including plugging in any usb device, file writes, etc.\nI want to completely erase the files, not just mark the file deleted. So,\nusing an ubuntu 12 live CD, I figured I could shred the C directory and eliminate the threat. So, to shred everything, I needed to follow each directory recursively.\nI used the following command: \nfind * -exec shred -f -v -z -u {} \\;\n\nFor 20 gb of data, the shredding lasted about 28 hrs.\nAfter it was completed, I viewed the directory using: ls -l.    I expected to see no files.  What I saw instead was each filename with a green background.  There were a few filename withouth the green background but the text was in green.  So, what the heck does the green background mean, and more importantly, why are the files still there?\n\nA: If you want to get rid of Windows, it would be far easier to just delete the Windows partition. This can be done with the GParted software program which is available from the software center. To delete the partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open GParted and type in your password when prompted to grant it administrative privileges,\n\n*Locate your Windows partition and right click it to make sure it is not mounted (\"Unmount\" selection should be greyed out, click it if it isn't),\n\n*Select the Windows partition and click the Remove button, which is denoted with a red X,\n\n*As long as you are sure you don't want to risk keeping any important Windows files, click \"Apply\" and proceed.\n\n\nTo explain the problem you are having with shred: The -u option Deletes the files, but does not remove them. It is possible for the data of a file to be deleted, but the file's record will still remain in the filesystem.\nWhat you are seeing with the ls command is basically the file system's record of the file, rather than file data. The reason shred was written that way is because the command is often used on a device file for a hard disk or something, such as dev/sda, and you don't want to delete those. To remove files after shredding them, use the --remove option.\n\nA: If you want the file names to be completely removed from the disk after shred just add -u as an option, as shown below\nshred -vzu -n 5 filename.txt\nThe above command shred filename.txt \nv - show progress\nz - add a final overwrite with zeros\nu - truncate and remove file after overwriting\n-n 5  in 5 iterations\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu server with basic VGA only instead of loading graphics card driver I have an Intel DN2800MT motherboard with a graphics card that isn't well supported.  I'm able to completely install Ubuntu server on the machine, but when it boots after install I get a kernel panic, presumably because the graphic driver is tanking.\nHow do I tell the installer (or Grub for that matter) /not/ to load any graphics drivers?  I don't care if I'm stuck with 80x25 basic VGA, the machine is a server and I'll only be accessing it from SSH.\nI've probably installed Ubuntu a hundred times on various machines and am reasonably confident with the command line.\nMany thanks!\n\nA: Turn it off, remove your graphics card, plug the VGA into the Motherboard directly, and turn it back on.  \n", "Q: Tons of Processes Running I have an Ubuntu 13.04 running on a P4 computer with 1 Gb of RAM (I know, I need to get a new one).

They're hogging my RAM! How do I stop them? Let me know if you need more info. \n\nA: 1st, take a look at Linux Ate my RAM to understand how memory management is done by Linux kernel.\n2nd, remove all server packages that you don't need, .e.g. apache2, mysql, sendmail etc...\nPaste your pstree output so that we can help you to figure out what you don't need.\n", "Q: How do I install Grub on what I believe is a RAID setup? I have an older desktop computer with two hard drives that do not have the /dev/sda format so from my research I see, I'm dealing with a fakeraid or RAID setup.\nI have run the Ubuntu 13.04 installation several times and so far nothing has worked. It always stops and gives me a fatal error that: Grub cannot be installed on /dev/sda. I have tried many options to install grub using the livecd, but nothing is working.\n\nA: If you're only intending to use one partition, you can try removing the existing raid setup, and reinitializing it through Ubuntu.  I have a lot of trouble with my \"fake raid\" in Ubuntu as well.  \nDid you set your Raid up through the BIOS?  I would try removing that, and letting the Ubuntu installer set up it's own raid partition.  \nNote:  The installer can set up some good fake raids that automount at boot and all that fun stuff, but from my experience, other OS don't detect the raid, ie. Windows dual boot wouldn't detect the RAID partition, just the two hard drives. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Edge; Ubuntu Touch? I have been looking forward to Ubuntu Touch for quite a bit of time, due to it's desktop like functionality and beautiful display. But now I have heard of the Ubuntu Edge, and I am confused on the difference between the two.\nWhat I am getting at is: will there be a true Ubuntu phone (the Ubuntu Edge) in 2014 while in October or November of this year the Ubuntu Touch OS will be available to use and boot up on Nexus products, OR is the Ubuntu Touch just a first model of the Ubuntu phone while the Ubuntu Edge is a second generation, more advanced model?\nI am mainly worried because the edge is sort of lacking funding at this moment and I would really enjoy being able to have a Ubuntu phone product within the next year.\n\nA: hardware vs. software\nUbuntu Edge is a bespoke, limited edition smartphone device (platform). It will run both Ubuntu Touch and Android.\nSee:\nhttp://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge <-- The offer, and video\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edge <-- basic background\nOr do a Google search ..\n\nUbuntu Touch is Ubuntu (Linux) with a touch-interface. Its current focus is on the 'phablet' form factor.\nSee:\nWhat is Ubuntu Touch (Ubuntu for Phones)\n\nA: Ubuntu Touch is the software while Ubuntu Edge is the 'superphone'.\nUbuntu Touch can be downloaded and installed on a similar spec'd smartphone running Android. It is still in the development stage. If you have a Nexus smartphone, particularly the latest one, you can get the mobile OS and test it.\nUbuntu Edge on the other hand, as being campaigned by Canonical, will use Ubuntu Touch and Android as its operating systems so you have three operating systems in one device - Ubuntu for desktop, Ubuntu Touch and Android. Ubuntu Edge will be available mid next year.\nThe main features of Ubuntu Edge are shown and explained well in this video by Canonical.\n\nA: You are confused with Ubuntu Edge and Ubuntu Touch.\n\nis the Ubuntu Touch just a first model of the Ubuntu phone while the\n  Ubuntu Edge is a second generation, more advanced model?\n\nActually, Ubuntu Touch is an operating system for smartphones. Currently it is under development and is available for testing. On the other hand, Ubuntu Edge is a smartphone from Canonical with a very high specifications (superphone..?). So, Ubuntu Touch is an OS like Android; Ubuntu Touch is a device like Nexus.\n", "Q: Ubuntu BIOS Boot Macbook Air My dad installed Ubuntu 12.04 on his Macbook Air as a clean install, and it worked great at first, but I recently began to work on it (upgrading, updating, installing, and fixing some bugs), and eventually had to restart it.  That is where I encountered some issues:\nWhen booting, I had to hold the \"Option\" key to boot Ubuntu, because he deleted the Macintosh HD, and the EFI was attempting to boot that, but couldn't find it.  Thus, it gave only a white screen.  The problem can be easily solved by holding the \"Option\" key and selecting the drive, like I mentioned before, but that can be tedious when booting. \nNext, there is another problem: sometimes even when booting the BIOS, it gives only a purple screen without allowing to select an OS.  So far, the booting process is a tedious string of holing \"Option,\" selecting the drive, holding \"Delete\" to load the BIOS, and finally selecting Ubuntu.  I don't want my dad to have to go through that every time he boots.\nMy main questions are as follows:\nFirst, is there a way to scrap the EFI and boot directly to BIOS in Ubuntu? Or maybe just set the EFI to automatically boot to BIOS?\nSecond, can I set BIOS to automatically boot to Ubuntu?  If so, could I still be able to load it up by holding Delete when needing to access the recovery disk?\nThank you.\n\nA: You may want to install rEFInd, which is a boot manager for EFI-based computers. Be sure to install it from Windows, not from Linux. Also, install the driver for the filesystem on which your Linux kernel resides (probably ext4fs), but not other filesystem drivers -- some users have reported that installing extra drivers causes some Mac models to hang at boot time.\n\nA: I think the appropriate thing to do is to bless your linux partition using the OS X disk (use e.g. an external CD drive, then launch a terminal and use a command like # bless --folder /efi/grub --file /efi/grub/grub.efi): I did that on my MBA1,1, and there's plenty of guides on the internet recommending to do that for a Linux only install, e.g. the Arch Linux wiki.\nNote that rEFInd is not strictly required in this business.\n", "Q: How to keep my Pytrainer data after a fresh install of Windows and Ubuntu? I am thinking about doing a fresh install and setting up a dual boot Windows and Ubuntu system. I need to keep my data from Pytrainer on the new system. How can I do that?\n\nA: Find the directory Pytrainer uses to save it's information at, and copy it all to another drive for safe keeping while you perform your format and reinstall of the dual OS. \nI've never used the program but that's all I would do.\n", "Q: Installation of 12.04 on an usb stick I already booted in with the Usb stick, but when ever I try and open Ubuntu or even installing it goes to commands and says: invalid argument cannot mount. What does that mean? How do I fix it?\n\nA: It should go into the install automatically once you boot, you shouldn't have to \"try and open Ubuntu\" in any way, it should just.... Go.  \nSometimes Ubuntu USB install doesn't work very well.  Try reformatting the USB and setting it up again, either with the live cd again, or with the alternate installer if that doesn't work. \n", "Q: GRUB2 - recovering Windows Recovery Environment I've got an issue with Windows Recovery Environment after the Ubuntu installation, in particular after the installation of GRUB2. On sda1 I've got a Windows 7 installation thing (bootable, something like previously supplied Windows installation CD but on HDD, the biggest mistake of Microsoft). On sda2 I've installed Windows 7 which now I need to reinstall. \nGRUB2 sits at the first 512 b of sda with the following 4 entries:\n• Linux ...\n• Linux recovery ....\n• Windows 7 ....\n• Windows 7 recovery env...  \nEverything works OK except for the Windows Recovery Environment. The entry for Windows Recovery Env is as follows:\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ntfs\nset root='(hd0, msdos1)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set da1e-3be0\ndrivemap -s (hd0) ${root}\nchainloader +1\n\nAfter choosing Windows 7 recovery env, I get the following error:\nbooting a command list\nerror: no argument specified,\nPress any key to continue...\n\n...and then a black screen with a blinking cursor appears.\nI think I've tried everything that I could only think of. I remember that when I first installed GRUB2 I had to do some manual changes to Windows 7 entry because it wouldn't run either. So I tried in a various ways to modify the entry for Windows recovery, but with no luck. I even did a backup of MBR (first 512 b of my sda) and tried to restore the Windows boot from some other Windows installation CD by running bootrec /fixmbr and then /fixboot... but after this the thing got even worse because then on PC startup instead of loading Windows directly, I only got a black screen with an annoying blinking cursor, so I had to recover my Grub2 from the backup to boot anything at all.\nIs there any way to get to the sda1 and boot the Windows Recovery thing from it? I would be very grateful for any kind of hint!\n\nA: If the data of the recovery software has been damaged, you may have to resort to a new copy of win7 in place of it.  The second repair attempt probably caused a few conflicts if they were different versions.  It has happened to me before.  The corrupt recovery software was the initial issue, if the initial install had overlay software at the beginning of the drive, it may have not have moved it all when grub was installed. This would cause a corruption of the boot segment of the recovery partition.  The manufacturer does not make it easy to repair/modify the recovery software for fear of piracy.  It is in effect the same thing as a broken cd or corrupt iso.  It has to be replaced w manufacturer's disc or be replaced with a install that doesn't have a recovery partition in use.  Grub is having trouble with the location of the start of the recovery.  see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/663137 for referance to a sample grub cfg config.

I thought after executing above mentioned command, it will create usbfile.bin file. But I'm getting error.\n\nA: To simply create the file, use command touch /path/to/file. But you have to be sure that this path exists and you have write permissions into that directory.\nNow, you choose /mnt/cdrom as path to file. This is obsolete path to CD-ROM. Since it was created manually (probably with sudo prefix), it allows writing there only to the root user. Correct path is /media/cdrom. And even if it was mounted, you would have no write permissions into that directory, because it is a CD-Read Only Memory. The only way you can write files directly onto CD filesystem is using DVD+R/DVD+RW disks.\nSo, the right command in your case would be such:\ntouch ~/usbfile.bin\ndd if=/dev/zero of=~/usbfile.bin bs=1024 count=1048576\n\nThen burn this file on DVD.

Look this guy reported a .bug\nThere is a program called  qtchooser but it's unreliable, I could not make it work.\nWhat I did:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand then just remove qt5-default, it's about a few kbs of program, then you can easily switch back to qt5 installing qt5-default. \nEDIT: I found an easier way to switch between qt4 and qt5 using environment variables\nTo switch to qt4\n export QTCHOOSER_RUNTOOL=qtconfig\n export QT_SELECT=4\n\n\nA: I found solution.

I have a bootable live-USB Flash Drive with Ubuntu installed on it, it has a casper-rw for persistence, but unfortunately, the casper-rw is almost full and the remaining space for storing data is running out, I can't delete more data, Can I create another casper-rw on the same USB with a different name (such as: casper-rw 2)  and mount it instead of the original one ?? and  in case of that process is impossble, Can I create another casper-rw file on another USB Flash Drive, or on HDD ??\nAnd how can I unmount the original Casper-rw (that has no additional space) , and mount the new created one?  and in case of I could create two casper files on the same surface of USB Drive, (should they have different names or (it is accepted to have the same name: casper-rw)?  or Should I change the name of each casper-rw file evrytime I would mount it?? (By renaming it : casper-rw and give the unmounted casper another name temporarily?\n\nA: I don't think multiple overlay fs-es are what you want or need, but I think there is a solution to you space problem. \nInstead of having more than one casper-rw you can extend the size of the one you already have. \nRoll down to the part saying Resize an existing casper-rw loop file.\n\nA: It is possible to create a new partition called casper-rw.\nThen transfer your casper-rw file content using dd. Please inform well before doing it.\nAnd move your casper-rw file to another place. It should work fine since it is called the same as your previous (and removed, of course) file...\nYou should also get informed of the better format of that casper-rw partition. But I guess that just using ext3 would work fine.\nNote: When I download a new ubuntu.img I use to burn a dvd with it. Then, if I need to repair the usb pendrive, I boot with the dvd and repair everything.\nNote2: I am working on another way of extending casper-rw, by creating a new partition called home-rw. Then, I should copy all my /home/ubuntu dir from my carper-rw to the new home-rw partition. And ensure that it has the same privileges that the original files. Finally, erase casper-rw's /home/ubuntu. And by doing this, getting a lot of free space for the original casper-rw.\nMy doubts are how to mount casper-rw for writing and transfer the data. It shouldn't be very difficult. I normally, work with mc (Midnight Commander) that makes everything very visually easy to accomplish. \nI hope this helps.\nalberto\n\nA: You can rename a blank casper-rw file to home-rw and use it in combination with a casper-rw file for a total of 8GB.\nIn this case the casper-rw is similar to a \"/\" partition in a Full install and the home-rw file is similar to a \"/home\" partition in a Full install.\nI usually use casper-rw and home-rw partitions in my persistent flash drives.\nRough benchmarking shows no difference in speed from using casper-rw and home-rw files.\nEdit 2017\nFollowing question asks about multiple casper-rw partitions but explains how to use multiple casper-rw files: MultiBoot with Multiple Persistent partitions\n", "Q: Mount a Partition with Documents I am still newbie to ubuntu.\nI have a partition (ext4) with all my Documents and Photos, etc. This partition doesn't have any mount point. I want to use Document folder from this partition as my Document folder in Home directory.\nI see few possibilities, somehow to mount this partition on booting (and not when I click on it in Folder Manager) and create symbol link from my /home/Documents to /media/partition/Documents or just mount all partition as /home/Document.\nIt seems like the first solution is cleaner, however the problem is I don't really understand how to mount partition on booting to constant media folder. \nWhat's is the right way to do so?\n\nA: To have partition with documents automounted during boot, you should have partition entry in your /etc/fstab file. Let me assume that you have / on /dev/sda1, swap on /dev/sda2 and Documents partition on /dev/sda5. Then your /etc/fstab should look like this:\n\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).\n#\n#                \n# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=b632398e-9f06-46f7-8fe9-3e61266354a6 /               ext4 notail          0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sda2 during installation\nUUID=b1585d95-2256-474d-87ba-ed797c7b8845 none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0\n\nTo make Documents partition automount during boot, you have to add such entry there:\n/dev/sda5 /mnt/Stuff  ext4 defaults,uid=1000,gid=46          0       0\n\nIf you have UUID of /dev/sda5, it is preferrable to put UUID= instead of /dev/sda5 on the first position. uid and gid are numeric IDs of your user account (usually 1000) and group plugdev (always 46). You can omit these options since defaults already contains needed permissions.\nNow, when your drive is mounted, you can make symbolic link to your documents:\nmv ~/Documents/* /mnt/Stuff/Documents\nrmdir ~/Documents\nln -sd /mnt/Stuff/Documents ~/Documents\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: First, copy everything you have in your current (Home folder) Documents folder over to that partition.\nSecond, I'm going to assume that there is a folder called \"Documents\" in that partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo umount /dev/sda3\n\n\n*\n\n*This is to unmount the partition if it's already mounted.\n\n\n*sudo mkdir /media/partition\n\n\n*\n\n*This will create our mount point.\n\n\n*sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak\n\n\n*\n\n*This will take a backup copy of the file we're going to edit.\n\n\n*sudo nano /etc/fstab. This will open up the file in a text editor. Navigate to the end of the file, and paste the following two lines (paste by Ctrl+Shift+V):\n#automounting the sda3 partition to use for Documents\n/dev/sda3   /media/partition           ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nWhen done, hit Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save and close.\n\n\n*\n\n*The second line ensures that sda3 is always mounted to /media/partition. The defaults option is the one responsible for auto-mounting, amongst other things. Read more here: Fstab - Community Ubuntu Documentation.\n\n\n\nA more robust method would be to replace /dev/sda3 with UUID=<randomnumbers> in the second line, that's why I asked you for the output of sudo blkid in the comments. \n\n\n*sudo mount -a\n\n\n*\n\n*This will make our changes to fstab take effect. If you get errors here, stop!\n\n\n*cd ~ && rm -r Documents\n\n\n*\n\n*This will delete the Documents directory in your Home folder.\n\n\n*cd ~ && ln -s /media/partition/Documents\n\n\n*\n\n*This will create a symbolic link to that Documents folder in the partition.\n\n\n*At this point, you're done. However, you'll probably notice that your Documents folder has lost it's properties, and looks like this:  and not like this . To fix this, do nano ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs and re-add the path to Documents in its respective line:\n XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\n\nCtrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save and close. Re-open Nautilus (your file manager) and you should be set.\n\n*Test by rebooting your machine.\nSince you've mentioned that you also have Pictures(, etc.) on that partition, you can repeat steps 6, 7 and 8 to create their symbolic links, but remember to backup whatever is in the current folders.\n", "Q: after reinstall ubuntu 12.04 stuck after login screen (not at login screen) showing colourful screen?

To do this I would very much use a signing-checking way.\nI am aware of VerifyIsoHowto. Still I am not very happy with offered. If some agent can manipulate one file download he surely can manipulate all file downloads. So the public key I get from a key-server can just be cheated to make the manipulated ISO file check okay, while indeed it has been injected a rootkit or worse.\nNow I am aware of that there is unfortunatelly no 100% sure way. But starting with the assumption that my current system is safe I have those keys used in the SecureApt mechanism. \nMy Question therefore:\nHow can the keys that I already trust in SecureApt (= the ordinary Ubuntu repository keys) be used to verify a freshly downloaded ISO?\nIndeed it would serve me well also if I could via the Ubuntu Repo (and hence in a deb that is verified implicitly via SecureApt) get those public keys which would be necessary to verify the signature of the iso.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nPS: of course I am aware that if Canonical is immoral and colaborates with NSA (which has money hey) we are all poisend anyhow. Let's just assume something like this could never happen, ok?\n\nA: The following steps allow you to verify the SHA256SUMS file for the downloaded Ubuntu iso:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (CTRL+ALT+T)\n\n*Import the keys from /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg via gpg --import /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg.

It's reflective of a development process that went out the window over a decade ago. This is their active choice. That's the why.\nYou can usually work around simple blocks with User Agent Switcher. I've used it for some banking in the past. Firefox will just \"pretend\" to be IE and this is enough to get past most issues.\nYou might find that some things don't work. They might be coded so single-mindedly for IE that Firefox just refuses to continue... Or they might be doing capability-based testing to work out if you're using IE (which User Agent Switcher won't cover). If that's the case, your only good option is virtualising.\nAnd by that I mean installing VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation, and installing Windows inside that.

I'm deploying a bunch of python scripts to my build, test and soon production server. It can be nodejs or any other thing I want to run under nginx so the location should be generic rather than specific to the type of script.\nThe files deployed are coming from the the build server artifacts and all versions (build, test and maybe also production) should reside on the same server so using a default folder is not an option as the builds would overwrite each other. The intention is to keep a complete installation contained in one folder per build no matter what type of script it is.\nFolder could look something like this:\n/usr\n    /local \n        /build\n            /www\n            /python\n            /nodejs\n        /test\n            /www\n            /python\n            /nodejs\n\nIs there a preferred location on linux where the root of each build installation should reside?\nI have seen /usr/local mentioned but am not sure it is the one to use.\n\nA: In unix and unix-like systems, you spread the files around the system based on what type of file it is. Executables go in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin, libraries go in /usr/lib etc. \nYour project sounds more like the \"Windows\" way; putting all files in one directory. The FHS prefers /opt for such schemes.\nE.g. /opt/yourproject_prod/, /opt/yourproject_test/\n", "Q: Gnome 3 classic on Ubuntu 12.04: how to get application shortcuts Since several weeks I left Unity for what it was, installed Gnome 3, and have been using the classic option. Back in the days of Gnome2 I had a bunch of shortcuts in the top menu bar, for all the apps that I opened daily, like Firefox, the terminal, Eclipse etc. Now I see \"Applications\" and \"Places\", then nothing, then the tray icons for mail, connection, date/time etc. \nAlthough I can open any application with the applications menu, I would like to have those shortcuts back. Is that possible and if so how? \n\nA: Just discovered that it's really easy. Open the applications menu and lookup the app you need. Click and drag it to the top panel and there it is! \nNB: Moving and deleting shortcuts is possible by pressing the Windows + left Alt key and rightclicking the icon. \n", "Q: How to change permission of /root/opt while it is owned by root I want to change the permission of the folder \"opt\" and \"usr\". It is owned by root. I can't change the permissions at this moment because it's showing \"You're not the owner, so you cannot change the permission\".\nI want to change permission of inside folders too. Is there any command for that please? I'm a newbie to Ubuntu and currently having 13.04\n\nA: First thing I will say: Do not change the ownership of /opt or /usr. You will cause masses of problems. For instance, if you change the ownership of /usr from root, then sudo will no longer work properly (in fact, it could render the computer unbootable from what I have heard). Indeed, there's very little that's owned by root by default that I would ever advocate changing the ownership of - once you do something like that recursively it becomes incredibly difficult to undo it. \nIf you need to create a file within one of them, use sudo. So, if you had instructions to install a program under /opt, in a folder called /opt/myprogram that needed to belong to you, you would perform the following commands;  cd /opt; sudo mkdir myprogram; sudo chown $USER myprogram.\nBut as I say, for the sake of your system's stability, ONLY change the ownership on files or folders you yourself have created. If you need to edit something owned by root, use sudo ahead of the command rather than taking ownership.\n\nA: If your user is in the sudoers list (/etc/sudoers) you can use sudo before the command.\n$sudo chmod 777 /root/opt\nSimilarly you can use chown command to change the owner of a file.\nBut it is not recommended to grant access to anything inside /root to users other than root.

After doing so, the out of space errors went away. \nSo in order to add space to the main partition in an Ubuntu virtual machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add space in VMWare tools\n\n*Boot to a live cd of GParted and increase the size of your partition. (This may involve multiple steps if you need to shift partitions around to get to the continuous free space).\n\n*Run the check command in GParted to find any errors in your newly enlarged partition.\n\n*Close the virtual machine (Currently in GParted)\n\n*Open the virtual machine settings and compress the drive (this will take a while).\n\n*Reboot into the normal OS. Everything should be working. Use disk usage analyzer to verify the sizes and space are correct.\n\n\nHopefully, this will be useful to others who run into the same issue.\n", "Q: I can't start a new project on Netbeans The issue:\nWhen I open the \"add new project\" dialog (screenshot below), I can't create a new project.

I couldn't find it, only themes in the AUR and Arch Wiki redirects to GRUB with no mention of BURG in the entire article.

Someone on the mailing list was talking about a netfs module for the EFI platform and the burg-mkimage command looks very similar to grub's which I use in my top uefi answer. Pulling upstream code to create the image and put it on the ESP doesn't appear to be a difficult task, I agree with that. The missing link however is to find the current upstream. A PPA exists from someone who appears to have been a contributor or developer with a lengthy warning in his profile: I DO NOT TAKE REQUESTS on what is put in my Repos. … Looking at the source package, it appears to be just GRUB from 2010 with undocumented changes and the package just comes out of nowhere with no reference to a code repository. Further the typical files like TODO, README and NEWS are from GRUB not BURG. Sure you could try to go back in the GRUB source at that time and do a diff, but I don't use BURG, a user interested in BURG should do that.\nPlease tell me where I'm wrong here or where I may have overlooked something. It's entirely possible that someone else has taken over this project and maintains a Git repository, but from all I can find this project looks like abandonware to me and currently so sloppily documented that nobody should have started to use it in the first place.\nWith that time spend on investigation and until further evidence shows up I'm going to flag all future questions about BURG as primarily opinion based or EOL.\nFinal note, though it should have been obvious: users of AskUbuntu are not responsible to do the communication work that active project members of a particular project should have been doing or keeping disorganized or abandonware projects alive.\n", "Q: kdenlive unable to show corectly or open folders or files with Unicode names (Ex: Arabic) I was working on kdenlive correctly with out any problem in Ubuntu 13.04 x32.\nI use Ubuntu13.04 x64 Unity and installed Kdenlive form software center.

This isn't a huge problem, I'm not really trying to use this laptop for much, but I am a web developer and was hoping this would be more stable than the Win7 that was on it. \nATI/AMD no longer support this particular device, I've already downloaded the proprietary catalyst suite and run it, and got \"your device is not supported.\" Are there any third-party or OS drivers out there that will at the very least support webGL so I can test canvas/css3 in-browser? Here's the output of my chrome://gpu about the driver, btw:\nGL_VERSION  2.1 Mesa 9.1.3\n\n\nA: Bah. I hate answering my own question, but here goes:\nAs it turns out, chromium happens to just disable webGL for my particular hardware configuration. It is supported, it's just forced off.

So for the time being I'll leave this answer here but not select it if someone can come up with a better driver that is not as crash prone... but that might not be a problem at this point.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the open source drivers are probably the best you are going to get for now. I have the same problem with my AMD 4650 card. It got moved to the legacy driver branch and doesn't work really well with recent Ubuntu versions anymore.\nFor me the open source drivers work just fine (but do have some power management issues..) and even Steam games generally run very well.

It was disabled since Ubuntu 9.10 (but you could recompile the kernel to get it -- CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y). In the Linux kernel it was completely removed in 3.5 so it is completely missing since Ubuntu 12.10.\nSo the bad news is that you cannot enable usbfs in Ubuntu 13.04 if you do not replace the kernel for an older or patched one.\nAlternate solution\nIt seems that the similar content as was in /proc/bus/usb/devices is now available in /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices.

I installed a brand new SSD with Ubuntu 12.04, which I later upgraded to 12.10. Everything works fine, except for the fact that the CPU gets very hot. This problem exists under 12.04 and 12.10. It did not exist under Windows Vista.\n-Idle temperature is around 55 degrees Celcius (@ about 2-3% CPU usage)\n-When watching 1080p video (CPU usage around 50%) it can get up to 90 degrees Celcius\nMy only guess is that it might have something to do with the integrated graphics (If I check under system > details, it says \"Graphics: Unknown\").\nOther than that, I don't have a clue. Any ideas?\nSome quick specs:\nIntel® Pentium® dual-core mobile processor T3200 (1 MB L2 cache, 2.0 GHz, 667 MHz FSB, 35 W), supporting Intel® 64 architecture\nMobile Intel® GL40 Express Chipset\nMobile Intel® GL40 Express Chipset with integrated 3D graphics, featuring Intel® Graphics Media Accelerator 4500M (Intel® GMA 4500M) with up to 1759 MB of Intel® Dynamic Video Memory\n\nA: 90° C is high, but is still within range.  According to Intel you processor is rated at 100° C.\n\nNow the fact that you said the you've been running window for 4 years, I'm sure that the unit has accumulated its share from dust.  My suggestion try to clean the CPU fan with some compressed air, I think it will help.\n\nA: I've seen this on a couple of laptops. Depending on how the BIOS is set up, the fans may only \"kick in\" if the temperature gets too high. If \"too high\" was determined by Windows to be lower that the BIOS \"too high\" then when switching to ubuntu you may find the fans don't run as much. I would see if there's any relevant BIOS settings on your machine.\nThere are also a number of ubuntu programs for automatically increasing the fan speed. As another post points out, you're below the maximum temperature but running a CPU at cooler temperatures will decrease your failure rate.\n\nA: Well I removed as much dust as possible (especially from the CPU fan area) and that made the temperature drop about 10 degrees. The temperature range is now about 45-80 degrees Celcius. Still a bit higher than when I was using Windows, but I'm quite happy with the results. I might renew the thermal paste on the CPU as well, just to see if this further decreases the temperature.\nThe fan DOES seem to behave very different under Ubuntu than it did under Windows. I might have to look into that as well.\n\nA: I don't know how you can solve this but I recommend you to take some precautions like:\nYou need to know or be aware when your pc cpu is getting very hot, if I were you I used a program to handle this, because the temperature can kill your cpu, it affects badly on performance and its life.. \nI wrote a script about this I called it CPU Temperature Alarm System.\nYou may wanna see it.

I have a net book with Windows 7 Starter and I downloaded Ubuntu on my usb drive, since I don't have a disk drive. And I want to install it and delete windows all at the same time, because I don't think it will have the processing capacity to to have both at the same time. Anyway to do that?\n\nA: Well, you would just do a normal USB boot and then there is an option when installing ubuntu to either do a dual boot or delete the other OS completely.\n\nA: If for \"processing capacity\" you mean CPU & RAM, then you don't need to wipe Win7. You can install Ubuntu in another(s) partition(s) of the hard disk in what is called a dual-boot system: each time you start your netbook you will have the option to boot one or the other OS, so resources won't be shared (and more limited). That is definitely the best option if you want to try/use Ubuntu but still need Win7 and your CPU&RAM are scarce (an usual alternative is to run one of them as a virtual machine inside the other but then you will be sharing those scarce resources).\nI would not call it \"processing capacity\", but if what you mean is hard disk space, then yes, you will need to share that in a dual-boot scenario (Win7 takes much more minimum disk space, and while Ubuntu can access Win7 filesystem, the other way round is, at least, more difficult). In this case, maybe installing Ubuntu instead of Win7 Starter will make better use of your limiting resources.\nYou will have both options available when you boot from the bootable USB Ubuntu installer (install Ubuntu keeping or replace Win7).\n", "Q: Dualboot windows 8 uefi and ubuntu 13.04 64-bit I am trying to dualboot windows 8 and ubuntu 13.04 64-bit.

I want to surprise my dad for his birthday with a fairly nice graphics card as his old one doesn't work with new versions of Ubuntu. He cannot run Unity at all and he wishes to.\nHe has a Dell XPS 410 Desktop. I'm looking for a card that will run Ubuntu 13 and future versions. He doesn't play any games, he surfs the web constantly. I don't have a lot of money, 300$ is my limit for this card. I've looked through the hardware supported but as I'm not really good at an of this I have no idea what it means. Could someone just suggest a few good cards? Thanks!! \n\nA: Nowadays, it really doesn't matter anymore. I found that both nVidia and AMD have great proprietary drivers. Nvidia might have a bit better drivers I think.\nSo no worries about drivers.. just worry about which card fits your needs and budget best. :)\n\nA: You can check out the Component catalog.  The component catalog contains devices from 242 manufacturers. \nYou could also check out the Ubuntu Certified hardware\n", "Q: How do I make an input method for my conlang I am trying to make an input method for my constructed language, and have no idea where to start. I haven't found any helpful information on any forums. I am trying to make a syllabic language, so I would need it to work similarly to a Japanese input method. Type English letter combination like \"tsu\", get \"つ\".\n\nA: An easy way if using IBus for simple substitution input methods is to use ibus-table. So first:\nsudo apt-get install ibus-table\n\nThis includes a template file in /usr/share/ibus-table/tables/template.txt which you can copy and modify to fit your language. If you copied it to my-lang.txt, you can then build the database with:\nibus-table-createdb -s my-lang.txt -n my-lang.db\n\nThis will create the sqlite database. After that,\nsudo cp my-lang.db /usr/share/ibus-table/tables/\n\nAfter that either restart ibus by going to the indicator menu and selecting Restart (if ibus is not running you can start it with ibus-daemon -d). Then either running ibus-setup or selecting Preferences in the indicator, you can add your new input method on the Input Method tab (should be in Other in the dropdown menu), and select it in the indicator.\nThis is documented a bit here: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/wiki/HowToCreateATableForIBusTable\nAlso for a slightly better example than the default template, I suggest looking at the source for ibus-table-latex (assuming you have the source repositories enabled),\napt-get source ibus-table-latex\n\nthen check out tables/latex.txt in the downloaded ibus-table-other directory.\n", "Q: Cannot Install Wine Windows platform loader both from Terminal and software Center I recently installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my PC.

Then simply sudo apt-get install python-opster in the terminal, provide your user password and get the complement installed.\nNow, if you run the script with no parameters you'll see the options as shown in the next screenshot:\n\nWe'll send the script's command with the \"typing\" option in order to get the individual gif shots as follows:\n\nThis will reproduce your keypresses in the terminal and will get an individual screenshot for each iteration. Which will result in several gif images in the folder, the images will be named \"step???.gif\" as seen in the next screenshot:\n\nNow, we will use the convert command from the Imagemagick package in order to drop the next line in the terminal so that we can get a one-file gif animation made from these step???.gif image files, as follows:\nconvert -delay 50 -loop 0 *.gif terminal.gif\n\nPlease note that I am using *.gif having in mind that there are no other .gif files in the same folder, otherwise they may be merged in the resulting animation.\nHere you can change the -delay and the -loop parameters, the same as the resulting filename.\nYou can also import these step???.gif files in gimp or any other image manipulation program in order to make a better (optimized) gif animation which will result in a smaller file size.\nPlease let us know if you succeed with this workaround or if you are experiencing a different kind of an issue, don't hesitate to let us know also. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: Which partition to select as device for boot loader in an EFI mode install? I'm trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows 8 (to dual boot) on my new laptop. \nSince there is already an EFI partition on the disk, I didn't create another one (as suggested in: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Creating_an_EFI_partition) and I selected /dev/sda3 as the device for boot loader installation.

I restored computer to factory state using recovery and now trying to install ubuntu again. \nWhich partition should I choose for \"Device for boot loader installation\"? Thanks for the answers.\nHarddisk is partitoned like this: \n\n\nA: While with BIOS/MBR systems you install to the MBR and almost never to a partition, with UEFI you always install to the efi partition. It actually should default to install to that partition anyway and you can only have one efi partition (with boot flag) per drive. \nIn your case installing grub to sda3 the efi partition is correct. You should see multiple folders for each system you have installed, in Ubuntu they are mounted at /boot/efi and on the drive you have ubuntu & Microsoft folders with boot files:\n/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi\n/boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\nGrub2's os-prober has a bug and only creates BIOS boot entries which do not work with UEFI. You do not chainload to the Windows install like BIOS, but chain load to the efi partition.

If the images don't work for Nexus 7 (2013), are there any plans to migrate to and support this device?\nThanks for any help and advice.\n\nA: Best answer (for now):\nfrom: https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/msg03337.html\n\nWe'll still just support the old Nexus 7 for now, as we first need to\n  start the port for the latest device. It should work, but the main\n  problem is that the device is based on Android 4.3 by default, so it\n  requires us to make our layer compatible with that as well (at least\n  the 4.3 based binaries).\nDon't have the device, so can't give more details, but don't see why\n  not (we would at least have the same possibility to distribute\n  binaries, so we could also produce such a build once the port is\n  done).\n\n\nUpdate, 27-Feb-2014:\nI have Ubuntu Touch 14.04 beta (build 209) running on my ASUS Nexus 7 (2013), 16GB, WiFi device. (I also updated my LG Nexus 4, 16GB smartphone, to build 209, using same method.) \nI used the new ubuntu-device-flash tool. The code itself is based on the (fairly new) AOSP ('Android Open Source Project') 4.4.2 source code, and is a major improvement over earlier efforts.\nBe patient.\nThe instructions on 'Install' page are partially updated, but do show how to do the install.\nFlashing a phone/tablet with Ubuntu\nOnce I have this repeatable, I will post details (if 'Install' page not updated) ..\n", "Q: Can't see system drive Sda1 I can't see my \"C\" drive any more (excuse the DOS notation) It doesn't show up in my home folder.The drive is partitioned into a 30GB Root and the rest reserved for data None of it shows up in my home folder.

I'd like to just have Ubuntu installed, and run Windows in a virtual machine. What would be the best way to do this without losing any files?\n\nA: A good way to convert your physical Windows 7 install to a virtual machine would be to use VMWare's free converter tool: http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/\nAfter you've done that, you can wipe Windows off your machine. This describes a way to do it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToRemoveWindows\n\nA: My suggestion would be you take a backup of all the files to a external drive from the windows partition OR just copy the data to the Linux/Ubuntu partition.(just for safety).\nFrom here on there are two options.\nOption ONE:\nOne is create a image of the Win7 OS (you can easily find links on Google),\nCreate a boot-able disc or thumb-drive and load that bootable as a VM on your VM program (i prefer \"virtual box\" or VM ware, which ever suits your style).\nFollow instructions accordingly for making images,And you might not lose the installed programs if you make a good image. \nOption TWO:\nJust Wipe your windows.\nExtend the Ubuntu/Linux Partition to the free space.\nInstall fresh copy of windows on VM and install the required softwares.\nThings to consider:\n1.This assuming you have already ample space to run your VM (say 20Gb would be a minimum)\n2.Do you have enough ram ?(I have a 4gb ram on my laptop and VMachines are irritatingly slow)\n3.Would you be using Windows for lot of I/O jobs (like digital cameras, networking,gaming because VMachines are under a certain limit in terms of peripherals)\n\nA: As it may in theory be possible to convert a bare metal installation of Windows into a virtual machine I would not recommend doing so. \nKeep in mind that other than Ubuntu a Windows installation will be very different depending on the hardware (e.g. loading different kernels, licence key depends on hardware, drivers are only loaded when the hardware is present). This hardware will be gone after moving to a VM, and Windows may then not run at all.\nA much better and a stable way to have a lean and functional installation of Windows running as a guest on Ubuntu is to install it there from scratch. As you may not need much of the Windows add-ons because you do most of the tasks on the host you may want to shrink the Windows as much as possible.\nNow these are the steps I would recommend you take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your data to be able to restore then in any case\n\n*Shrink your Windows using tools like nLite (for XP) or RT7lite (for Windows 7)\n\n*Install the optimized Windows in a VM\n\n*Share your data partition with the VM to also be able to access it from Ubuntu\n\n*Exhaustively test your virtual Windows and make a backup before deleting the original installation\n\n", "Q: Inability to install on Acer 4530 with Vista I have tried to make a clean Ubuntu 12.04 installation on an Acer 4530 currently running Win Vista.

I am trying to open a terminal and cd to the folder so I can take ownership so I can run the program. However every time I try the cd command I get the error msg \"user/HOME/computer does not exist\". How do i do this, or is there a better way of accessing this program, I really don't want to have to reboot into windows every day just to burn a few disk. I have seen several forum post where other people were having problems and eventually got it working, and I tried what they did and it did not work for me. \n\nA: Firstly, I'm not sure what you mean by \"user/HOME/computer does not exist\". I figure out what you're calling \"computer\" is the root directory, which under Linux is denoted with a slash character / at the beginning of the pathname. Hence in order to cd there, all you have to type is:\ncd /opt/lightscribe\n\nAnd notice how the pathname begins with a /. Also, if you're going to cd to a folder whose name contains a space, you will need to escape it, either using a backslash before the space, as in...\ncd /opt/lightscribe/simple\\ labeler\n\n... or by quoting the whole pathname:\ncd \"/opt/lightscribe/simple labeler\"\n\nNow secondly, I don't really think you need to take the ownership of a program in order to run it. Almost all programs we install are installed somewhere under the root folder, owned by the root user -- not in normal users' home directories, and not owned by them.\nWhether the program's main binary is under somewhere like /usr/bin or inside /opt doesn't make a difference. You can read and execute files be them here or there (And if this weren't the case, you wouldn't be able to even browse the directory in your GUI file manager). The only thing you can't do is modifying them, which is a good safety measure that you should not bypass unless you absolutely have to.\nThat all being said, since you can browse there, then the problem is just mistyping the path in the terminal. The tips above should suffice to typing it correctly, I think. And keep in mind that pathnames under Linux are case-sensitive. You can't type HOME or Home if the folder is called home.\nFinally, and to make life easier, I think any file manager you might be using should have an \"Open terminal here\" command so that you don't have to separately open a terminal and manually cd all the way to where you are. Usually it's found in the context menu popped up by right-clicking over an empty area (and not a file or directory).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Error messages are usually trying to tell you something. If the folder exists but you don't have permission to view/execute it, the error will say so. So your first problem is to figure out what directory you should be launching from.\nThen, if you have permission to run the script running it from the command line should work fine:\n% /opt/lightscribe/simple\\ labeler/launchbrowser.sh\n\nOr, it will give you a new, different, equally useful error to work from. \n", "Q: Can I shrink gedit's side panel?

I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\nHi I have been working on the following issue for a couple of days and as much as a I look at the many different answers (What is PATH environment variable and how to add it) I cannot make them work. I would be extremely grateful if anyone could detail me the required steps for a basic Ubuntu user:\nI have Eclipse installed in my Dropbox folder and I have some Python .py files on it.\nI have managed to add this folder to the path and now when I execute:\necho $PATH\n\nI can see (among others) my folder with the python codes.\nHowever when I try to run these files from any other folder:\n$ python HelloWorld.py\n\nI get:\npython: can't open file 'HelloWorld.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n\nUPDATE:\nThe solutions described below provide the main steps to make this work:\n1) Add to your python scripts (.py) The \"shebang\" line \n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nThis must be the FIRST line in your code. \n2) Go to the folder where the python script is located and source it: \nchmod +x yourscript.py\nOnce it is done you can run it from any folder (and the auto-complete will work). Incidentally, (this works in eclipse) if you duplicate an executable script within the editor, you can clear it and rename it and it shall remain executable. So you can avoid step two.\n\nA: The command python is expecting a file in the current working directory with the name HelloWorld.py and that is why it's failing (it does not look in PATH for this, and this makes sense).\n\nThe PATH variable is for directories that contain executables (commands). If your Python files have the shebang:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nand are executable, you should be able to run them as:\n$ HelloWorld.py\n\nfor example.\n\nSay you want to add the directory ~/MyExecutables to PATH. You would add the line\nPATH=\"~/MyExecutables:$PATH\"\n\nto your .bashrc file.\nIf ~/MyExecutables has an executable file called myexecutable you would be able to run it as\n$ myexecutable <arguments>\n\nTo make a file myfile (in ~/MyExecutables) executable you'd run:\n$ chmod +x ~/MyExecutables/myfile\n\n\nRemarks. If a file is in a directory contained in PATH, but this file is not executable you won't be able to run it. Also if the file is a non-bash script and does not have the shebang line, it won't run even if it is executable.\n\nA: I believe you would have to add the folder to your python path for that approach to work. Instead, try adding a shebang to the top of your python file which should look something like this\n\"#!/usr/bin/python\"\nThe path after the shebang \"#!\" Should be the path to your python interpreter which might be /bin/python. What this does is tell bash or whatever terminal your using to use python for the script.\nAfter doing this you should be able to execute the file by just typing \"HelloWorld.py\" into the terminal.\nSorry for the quick answer.

Now when i boot my primary OS UBUNTU i am facing a small error that \"Uaaa-ssdds-------\" is missing wait for mounting automatically or S for Skip or M for manually mounting.\nHow to solve this problem I i need to recreate a Linux Swap.\n\nA: If you have 4GB or more RAM, I would say you most likely don't really need a SWAP partition. If you have less, I would recommend to have one.\nIn case you want to add it back:\nJust use gparted, for example, to figure out the UUID and/or your device letter and add back the line in /etc/fstab to mount it.\nIn case you just want to remove your warning:\nYou can simply remove the line of the swap partion from /etc/fstab, and it won't show up again.\n\nA: In general, your computer does need a memory. But swap partition is special (limited) type of memory. It will help when you run out of physical memory - system will move some blocks of memory to swap partition. But will also slow down system, because\n\n\n*\n\n*hard disk operations are much slower(!) then RAM and\n\n*system will have to move blocks from hard drive to physical memory when they are needed again\n\n\nIn my case I don't use swap partition at all, on any of my Linux systems. \nHowever it's good idea to install some RAM indicator (ie System Load Indicator). When you run out of memory and there is no swap partition, process asking for memory will get an error and in most cases will close. If it happens - you might want to add more RAM or create swap partition.\nSo, question should be:\nDo I have issues related to not enough memory?\nIf so - I have to add more of it, so:\nIs it possible to add physical memory?\nIf not - create swap partition.\n", "Q: How can we connect the samba Domain server w/ LDAP backend from Ubuntu client?

As far as I know ubuntu plans to replace xorg with mir in the future. WM's who need xorg will run on an intermediate layer called xmir instead. In which version will ubuntu remove xorg from the repositories completely? (That's interesting for me since I usually do a minimal ubuntu install and then add some exotic WM's I like). \nIf ubuntu will drop the support for xorg, is there any ubuntu based distro (like Mint or Lubuntu) which has official plans not to use xmir and to provide an own package of xorg instead?\n\nA: Regarding the switch to Mir, please read the latest update of the Ubuntu Graphics Stack Roadmap. In short, Mir will be default compositor in 13.10, yet everything will still use x11 through xmir an x.org will be available as fallback. In 14.04 x.org will be completely removed and everything should run through xmir. Starting from 14.10, Mir itself will be used by Unity, and xmir will only be there for backwards compatibility.\nDebian, on which Ubuntu is based, will not switch to Wayland or Mir in the foreseeable future, so I expect x.org to be available in the Ubuntu repositories still for quite some time.\nAccording to a post in the phoronix forums, no other flavour of Ubuntu will use Mir anytime soon and probably none of them ever will. Those that rely on toolkits ported to Wayland will maybe switch to Wayland. \n(Sidenote: If you have time, read also this slightly *cough* biased posting, it lists possible reasons.)\n\nA: Mythbuntu will test Mir during the 13.10 dev cycle. Will decide later what to do for 14.04.\n\nA: From what I've heard on most news sites and podcasts, is that Ubuntu is the only distribution to announce they will be using mir.  Kubuntu announced they will NOT adopt mir.  I don't know anyone else's official stances.\n\nA: Mir is developed by Canonical to be used with Unity. I don't think any distro that does not use Unity will use mir, there's no reason to do so. What you might see is a distro starting to use Unity or a Unity fork and replacing x by mir.\nI don't think there's a way to tell when x will be completly dropped from the repositories for now, nor when it'll be replaced by mir as the official server.\n", "Q: Black Screen on Macbook Pro 6,2 After Installing 12.04LTS - Tried Everything Already I am tri-booting Mac OS 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard), Windows 8, and Ubuntu.

But I can't make any decision before I try the ubuntu at least once. Therefore I am grateful for any help.\n\nA: I've faced this issue several times when I've used my flash drive to install Windows and then make it bootable to install Ubuntu. In this case, all that your flash drive needs is marking it as Active. Follow instructions as below.\nGo to Windows and Open command prompt as Administrator.\nNow, run diskpart command which will open within command prompt.\nView list of drives connected.\nlist disk\n\nYou should see output something like below.\nDisk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt\n--------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---\nDisk 0    Online          465 GB      0 B\nDisk 1    Online         3820 MB      0 B\n\nWhere Disk 1 is your Flash Drive (notice it by size). Now select that disk. BE CAREFUL THAT YOU SELECT YOUR FLASH DRIVE.\nselect disk 1\n\nNow list partitions that the drive has.\nlist partition\n\nOutput should be something like as follows (showing only single partition ideally):\nPartition ###  Type              Size     Offset\n-------------  ----------------  -------  -------\nPartition 1    Primary           3819 MB    64 KB\n\nSelect that partition.\nselect partition 1\n\nNow mark it as active.\nactive\n\nYou're done! run exit and close command prompt.\nNow you can create it bootable again, from Ubuntu ISO and try if it boots to Live Desktop. I'd suggest you to use Universal USB Installer to do that.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Check the iso file\nStart by checking that the iso file was downloaded correctly. See these links,\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes\nChecking the iso file and the boot drive - detailed tips\nIf you can get the iso file via torrent, it is more likely to be downloaded correctly, because checksums are used in the torrent process.\nCloning is a reliable method to create a USB boot drive\nThese kinds of problems need not be encountered, if you clone the iso file to the USB flash drive. There are tools for that purpose in all operating systems.\nAll current Ubuntu family iso files (versions that are currently supported) are hybrid iso files. It means that they can be cloned to a USB flash drive or burned to a DVD disk and a bootable device will be created.\nLinux\n\n\n*\n\n*dd (simple, powerful but dangerous)\n\n*The Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and newer versions (but not in older versions)\n\n*Disks (alias gnome-disks)\n\n*mkusb\nWindows\n\n\n*\n\n*Win32 Disk Imager\nMacOS\n\n\n*\n\n*dd (simple, powerful but dangerous)\n\n\nRecommended extracting tool in Windows\nAccording to the [old] question in this thread, two extracting tools have failed.

And that's all frightfully dynamic these days.\nBut yes, built-in modules will probably use more memory.\nDon't forget that you can create a config based on the modules you're currently using with make localmodconfig.

However through my attempts I have only been able to get these apps to run using the mouse and there doesn't seem to be any gesture support.\nMy Touch Table hardware is producing touch events conforming to the MultiTouch protocol and has been tested and works fine with Kivy's TouchTracer app, used to test various inputs.\nI am not sure why the Ubuntu Touch mobile apps wouldn't work with uTouch, I haven't be able to find any information regarding this and what touch stack Ubuntu Touch is using.\nPut short, why don't Ubuntu Touch apps support the MultiTouch Protocol? And how can I develop apps that make use of the MultiTouch protocol? (the ABS_MT_POSITION_X and ABS_MY_POSITION_Y input events going through evdev).\n\nA: You should never have been able to use the evdev multitouch protocol, at least in production, because the evdev devices are typically readable only by root. X11 apps used the XI 2.x protocol for their multitouch support. \nAs far as I know, Mir (the display server library that Ubuntu Touch uses) forwards all the appropriate touch events on to the clients, but my detailed knowledge of the stack ends there.\nI'm pretty sure Qt5 has multitouch support, and that's presumably how apps are expected to get multitouch events. Are those events not getting through?\n\nA: \nPut short, why don't Ubuntu Touch apps support the MultiTouch Protocol? And how can I develop apps that make use of the MultiTouch protocol?\n\nThis is a planned feature. If it doesn't work quite right is because it's a developer preview, not a finished product. You must expect certain quirks in the development of the device.\nI would give the developers time to iron out bugs and other issues before trying to use not-quite-yet-developed-features.\n", "Q: How can I work out how long I've been an Ubuntu Member for? Like a lot of the users here, I've gone through the steps to become an Ubuntu Member. I won't reiterate the details of what that means but recently it was announced that certificates would be available for Members and I'd like to cash that chip in now.\nThe problem is the form asks when I became a Member... And I'm not sure. I suspect it somewhere in October 2011 because that's the last time I edited my wiki page.\nIs there a public registration of Ubuntu members that includes their registration dates?\n\nA: Launchpad keeps this information. Take a look at https://launchpad.net/~you/+participation. Start from \"Ubuntu Members\". If you are an indirect member (or became a member indirectly), then you may not see a join date, but you will see the groups that cause you to be an indirect member. These should lead \"recursively\" to a series of join dates, and the earliest one is the date when you became a member.\n\nA: For a hacky way, Googling site:irclogs.ubuntu.com  congratulations oli shows links me to the #ubuntu-meeting log where people were congratulating me for becoming a member.\n\nA: If you became an Ubuntu Member through the direct way you can see when, in Launchpad. On memberships page mentions \"Member Since\" \nIf you became an Ubuntu Member through the indirect way (ubuntuforums.org), then you can search for your application in UbuntuForums and check the last message.\nFor example my application is here and the last message from Elfy indicates that I became a member in November 17th 2012. Alternatively, a page exist in Launchpad for Ubuntu Forums Members\n", "Q: Ubuntu application switcher like ElementaryOS I love the way ElementaryOS aplication switcher looks like (alt+tab) and i want the same efect on my Ubuntu 13.04.

A temporary fix would be to use symbolic links pointing to the correct device...\n", "Q: Is it possible to run a command before log in screen? How can I run:\nxbacklight -set 0\n\nbefore login screen?\n\nA: For this you can use the file /etc/rc.local. Insert your command to this file before exit 0 and anytime you start your system the command is executed.

Do I need to downgrade any other packages?\nI'm unable to install a 6b24 package of icedtea6-jre-cacao via apt-get install.\n\nA: Finally found the solution.\nHad to use:\napt-cache policy icedtea-6-jre-cacao\n\nTo find the right version string to perform a downgrade. For some reason apt-cache showpkg and apt-show-versions didn't show it.\nSo the final commands to fix this problem where:\napt-cache showpkg openjdk-6-jre \napt-cache policy icedtea-6-jre-cacao\n\nTo find the right version to downgrade to. And:\napt-get install openjdk-6-jre=6b24-1.11.1-4ubuntu2 openjdk-6-jre-headless=6b24-1.11.1-4ubuntu2 icedtea-6-jre-cacao=6b24-1.11.1-4ubuntu2\n\nTo perform the downgrade.\nAfter downgrading from 6b27 to 6b24 the problems in NetBeans are resolved for me on both PCs.\n", "Q: How to enable bluetooth without restarting OS? I have a problem with bluetooth in Ubuntu 13.04. The bluetooth won't work until I restart my laptop.

All applications not started with bind.so route out as your main routing table specifies.\n\nA: If you can determine the specific IP addresses and/or ports that you want to use with VPN or vice versa, then the ip command will help you do that by allowing/disallowing a route for such and such.\nThe ip command is found in the iproute package:\nsudo apt-get install iproute\nman ip\n\nI've been using it in a very limited fashion so I do not want to give you detailed information, but I'm pretty sure you can figure it out with the documentation. You may also find good example online on how to do such things with the ip command.\n\nA: It is possible to configure a listening socket (i.e. a program that offers a service) to use a specific adapter.  But client programs such as Firefox will usually simply send IP packets to the OS (by binding to 0.0.0.0) and leave it up to the OS as to how those packets reach the internet.\nSome client programs do allow you to configure binding to a specific adapter IP address, but how to do this is down to each applications configuration.\nIt is possible to configure IPTABLES2 to use the PID (process ID) to route IP to a given adapter, but this PID will keep changing so would require the firewall rules to be continuously updated.\nA better solution is to install a simple SOCKS proxy, such as Squid (which is rather complicated), tinyproxy, Dante or SS5.\nBind the proxy server to offer SOCKS5 on the lo adapter and configure it to send all IP via the VPN adapter.\nIf you bind the proxy server to an Ethernet port, other machines in the same network can use the same SOCKS server.\nConfigure each app that needs to use the VPN to use the proxy server.\nThere are tools such as soxify and tsocks that can be used to force programs that don't natively support SOCKS to use it.\n\nA: If you want to use the vpn to route your trafic trough it, and you want for example to use it with firefox for example this is what you do:\nYou enter Firefox, go to Options menu:\n\nGo to Advance -> Network Tab\n\nNow in the Connection Settings dialog:\nSelect Manual configuration \nIn SOCKS Host, enter your loopback ip address (always 127.0.0.1)\nUse the port you chose above (80, or 8080 or whatever if you don’t want to use 80)\nMake sure SOCKS v5 is chosen\nIf you don’t want to proxy some addresses (maybe localhost or something) enter those addresses\\domains in the “No Proxy for:” text box\nClick OK.\n\nAnd you should be good to go. You can check your ip to see if it is working corectly.\nhttp://www.whatismyip.org\nThe procedure should be the same for the rest of the applications.

I had hoped that solaar would help, but it seems to only work for the Logitech wireless devices that use Logitech's proprietary scheme.  I have Bluetooth keyboard (K760).  I know it can be told to use the function keys (rather than the media keys) by default because I can do it on under OS X with software from Logitech.  Just remapping the keys won't work as F1, F2, and F3 are special in that they switch which Bluetooth device I connect to and the keys are not sent to the OS.\n\nA: Hi I have the k760 keyboard an im also trying to find a way to do this. \nThis seems to be a good place to start http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-input/msg24280.html\nHe has managed  to get it working for  k810. if you can get the setpoint codes for the k760 you should be able to modify this code to make it work for  k760 that is asuming that they are similar.\nUpdate: I got it working !!! used the same procedure as describedd in the link.\n#define HID_VENDOR_ID_LOGITECH          (__u32)0x046d\n#define HID_DEVICE_ID_K810              (__s16)0xb316\n\nconst char k810_seq_fkeys_on[]  = {0x10, 0xff, 0x05, 0x14, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};\nconst char k810_seq_fkeys_off[] = {0x10, 0xff, 0x05, 0x14, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00};\n\n\nA: It looks like the changes to the C code from the other answer do work (but off turns on the function keys, I had thought on would do that).

Perhaps Grub supports this kind of temporary boot options. I don't know.\nThe reason I want to be able to quickly jump into Windows (and soon back to Ubuntu again) is because I have Windows programs that I frequently use which can only run under Windows, and running them under Wine or similar is not feasible (e.g., Adobe Lightroom). Annoyingly I am forced to still rely on Windows. Also, I am not the sole user of the computer, so jumping between OS is important to do swiftly. The question is not about finding solutions to whether I can use a VM or similar to emulate my needs of Windows.\n\nA: The short answer is no. Boot loaders don't work that way.\nI am not a big fan of dual booting.  I think it's too much trouble to configure.  When I need both operating systems on a single machine, I choose the one I use the most as the main OS and run the secondary OS in as a virtual machine. This allows you to have both operating systems running on the same machine at the same time.\nIn the beginning, I had a Windows machine with Ubuntu running as a VM because I used Windows more often. Now I have an Ubuntu machine with a Windows VM.\nI don't remember the last time I ran the Windows VM.\n", "Q: Permission for mongodb user problem I am going to install mongodb on Amazon ec2 ubuntu 12.0.4 linux server and change the default location of the mongodb.

It's high time I learned, and lord knows no one else is going to do it for me.  Any info that could help me advance the ball would be most appreciated.\nLike many Linux users, I have experienced very weak signals with my Atheros AR9845 adapter.  After trying many of the fixes I found (to no avail), a helpful participant in the IRC #ubuntu room pointed me to this patch.\nI'd like to apply said patch, but I can't find the appropriate files.  I see the folder where they should be (/lib/modules/3.9.0-030900-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k), but the files mentioned in the patch do not exist.  \nAfter looking through the bug discussion, it appears that the patch should be applied on top of 3.10-rc6 (I think).  Does this mean I have to upgrade from Raring Ringtail 3.9 to Saucy Salamander 3.9 and then update to 3.10-rc6?  \nDo I need to backport wireless drivers into my current kernel version?  If so, a point in the right direction for an example of doing this with later kernel versions would be most appreciated.  I have seen a number of examples for pre-3.7 kernels, but it looks like the method of sharing these backports has changed.  To be honest, I am a bit at a loss for how to proceed with the new site at this point.\nI am currently using an ASUS Q550LF, and I am happy to edit with more info if needed.\n\nA: you just have to install the new driver.\nall the instructions are here : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/971809/comments/63\n", "Q: sshfs is not mounting automatically at boot, despite /etc/fstab configuration Setting up some Ubuntu (13.04) workstation, I am trying to have a remote filesystem mounted (over ssh).\nThe current config\n\n\n*\n\n*I created user someuser and added it to the fuse group\n\n*My fstab entry reads like : \nsshfs#someuser@remote.com:/remote_dir  /media/remote_dir/   fuse    auto,_netdev,port=22,user,allow_other,noatime,follow_symlinks,IdentityFile=/home/someuser/.ssh/id_rsa,reconnect     0       0\n\nfrom my understanding :\n\n\n*\n\n*auto : is explicitly asking for the remote fs to be mounted at boot\n\n*_netdev : wait for interface to be up before attempting to mount\n\n*user : allow any user to ask for this specific remote location to be mounted (useless in the perspective of the root user automatically mounting it at boot)\n\n*allow_other : will allow any user (in the fuse group ?) to access the mounted fs\n\n*IdentityFile : points to the private key paired with the public key added in the /home/someuser/.ssh/authorized_key of the remote machine.\n\n*reconnect : Not sure...

In addition, I've been using the option \"workaround=rename\" already before, since Oneiric times. Not sure whether it is still needed today, but at least it doesn't seem to hurt.\nMy full /etc/fstab line is:\nsshfs#user@host:/remote/dir /local/dir fuse delay_connect,idmap=user,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0,allow_other,_netdev,workaround=rename 0 0\n\nYou obviously would need to adapt user/group IDs to your own environment.\n\nA: Also to complement all previous comments,\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you allow non-root users to specify the allow_other mount option in /etc/fuse.conf\n\n*Make sure you use each sshfs mount at least once manually while root so the host's signature is added to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.\nsshfs [user]@[host]:[remote_path] [local_path] -o allow_other,IdentityFile=[path_to_id_rsa]\n\n\nA: had the same problem, i think you need auto to be noauto. it shouldnt mount on boot, it should mount when the eth is up\n\nA: If you are to mount it from an authoritative DNS server's /etc/fstab and the host name of your remote SFTP server is provided by this DNS server you are certainly not going to be able to connect because the host name can not be resolved yet. Either the DNS server has to be running while attempting to mount or you have to find an alternative method to obtain your remote server's IP address.\nIf this is the case, you can pick any of the following solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the delay_connect option so it will allow the boot sequence to continue and after the boot sequence has started the DNS server it will connect.\n\n*Add your remote SFTP server's host name to your local /etc/hosts file with the appropriate IP address.\n\n*Use your remote SFTP server's IP address in the fstab instead of host name.\n\n", "Q: restore /etc/init.d/rc.local I've mistakenly copied the /etc/rc.local over the /etc/init.d/rc.local and I was wondering how can I retore the init.d/rc.local contents? \nIs it possible to generate the original file or copy it from somewhere?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You can use `dpkg' to find out which package is providing a file. In your case you could have used:\nsudo dpkg -S /etc/init.d/rc.local\n\nThis would have told you that the file is provided by package `initscripts':\n$ sudo dpkg -S /etc/init.d/rc.local\ninitscripts: /etc/init.d/rc.local\n\nThen just reinstall that package:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall initscripts\n\nReferences:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/dpkg.1.html\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man8/apt-get.8.html\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 13.04.

It needs a primary NTFS Partition with the boot flag.\nIf installing and you do not want separate boot partition set boot flag on the primary NTFS partition you install into. Make sure BIOS is set to boot from that drive. Windows primarily has separate Boot partition, so you can encrypt the main install. The boot partition also has the recovery files, so you may need to make the separate repairCD or flash drive to repair Windows easily.\nYou may be able to use testdisk to restore partition table, but the sectors Windows overwrote will be damaged. \nIf you had data you do not have backups, then the only recourse is photorec which is part of testdisk. But that can be a long slow process.\n", "Q: Trouble installing ubuntu wubi 12.04 on windows xp dell dimension 3000 I have previously installed ubuntu wubi 12.04 on my dell dimension 3000 with windows xp home. I succeeded, but I accidently made myself a standard user, not an admin. I uninstalled, then tried to reinstall, but it told me that it could not get the iso files, so i put the iso file in the same folder as wubi.exe.\nWhen I ran the wubi then, it ran perfectly, but when i launched ubuntu it was \"coping files\", then it hung. The first time I installed it, I didn't have any trouble at all. Please help me. \n\nA: It sounds like this computer has issues with recent versions of Ubuntu e.g. here or here.\nNow the first time you installed Wubi, it sounds like it used the diskimage install method (if you run wubi.exe standalone with no ISO). This does not use ubiquity. So if you want to try that, I'd suggest removing any Ubuntu ISOs first (i.e. Ubuntu DVDs, USBs, ISOs in the same folder as wubi.exe as well as ISOs on the root of any drive - because Wubi finds these). \nThen make sure you have the latest 12.04 wubi.exe from here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ (because they get updated from time to time on an LTS release and the old ones won't work). That's the lightweight way to install with Wubi. It will still download the 500MB diskimage (if you're concerned about bandwidth).\nBut if you are okay with partitioning and don't need the Unity desktop, then skipping Wubi and using lubuntu or xubuntu will probably perform better on your hardware. For the longterm this is your best bet, because Wubi is being phased out and seems to get corrupted more easily due to running off a virtual disk.\n", "Q: \"Install alongside Windows 7\" option doesn't appear, \"no root file system\" if I try \"Something Else\" I reinstalled Windows 7 today.

I do not hibernate (boots fast enough for me) but if hibernating then you need swap equal to RAM in GiB not GB. And if dual booting with windows a shared NTFS partition is also recommended. But you usually cannot create that as part of the install, just leave some space.

The fact is that after GRUB disappeared, I left a black screen and the top lines begin to appear as distorted colors (if it's important I can take a picture with the phone and upload it) that does not extend to rest of the screen, there are 1 cm or something like that.\nI don't find the solution nowhere because of everything I found is related to problems with GRUB does not appeared or something.\nI leave the report of a sudo fdisk -l command on a Ubuntu terminal, hoping it can help:\n\nDisco /dev/sda: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n255 cabezas, 63 sectores/pista, 121601 cilindros, 1953525168 sectores en total\nUnidades = sectores de 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nTamaño de sector (lógico / físico): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nTamaño E/S (mínimo/óptimo): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nIdentificador del disco: 0x25233875\n\nDispositivo Inicio Comienzo Fin Bloques Id Sistema\n/dev/sda1 * 2048 206847 102400 7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2 206848 1245448800 622620976+ 7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3 1245450238 1953523711 354036737 5 Extendida\nLa partición 3 no se inició en el limite físico del sector\n/dev/sda5 1245450240 1936783359 345666560 83 Linux\n/dev/sda6 1936785408 1953523711 8369152 82 Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisco /dev/mapper/cryptswap1: 8570 MB, 8570011648 bytes\n255 cabezas, 63 sectores/pista, 1041 cilindros, 16738304 sectores en total\nUnidades = sectores de 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nTamaño de sector (lógico / físico): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nTamaño E/S (mínimo/óptimo): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nIdentificador del disco: 0x9e01f612\n\nEl disco /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 no contiene una tabla de particiones válida\n\n\nI hope you can help me, i would be so grateful.\nGreetings.\nEDIT:\nSorry I didn't know that I could use format.\nI'm having problems with Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7.\nResult for cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n#\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE\n#\n# It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates\n# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub\n#\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###\nif [ -s $prefix/grubenv ];

Using the terminal or a bash file, how can I configure Ubuntu to reboot every day at (say for instance) 3 AM?\nIn other words, I want to schedule an automatic reboot through the terminal.\nI haven't been able to find anything related to this on Google or AskUbuntu, and I'm fairly new to Ubuntu in general (just got my new Raspberry Pi).\n\nA: Edit the crontab entries using crontab -e command (by default this will edit the current logged-in users crontab) and add the following line:\n0 3 * * * echo $PASSWD | sudo -S reboot\n#change $PASSWD with your password\n\nSave the file and check the new crontab entry with crontab -l.\nIf you want to use only:\n0 3 * * * sudo reboot\n\nas crontab, this doesn't work normally and you should check this post to see how can you make it to work.\nOr, simple add the crontab to the root user's crontab file offering the complete path for the reboot command using sudo crontab -e:\n0 3 * * * /sbin/reboot\n\n\nA: Note that putting your clear-text password in a text file is not a good idea, so it's best to have this job run as root from the get-go. Usually, rather than editing root's crontab via the crontab command, which leaves the entries in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, a somewhat cryptic location, I prefer to enter them explicitly in /etc/cron.d. Entries in cron.d are run as system crontab entries, are treated as config files so they should survive system reboots, updates and upgrades, and you can explicitly specify the running user:\necho \"0 3 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h 5 'System will reboot in 5 minutes'\" | sudo tee /etc/cron.d/reboot-at-3-am\n\nIf you don't need a specific time, but rather, just want the system to reboot once daily, add an executable or script in  /etc/cron.daily and it will be automatically run at a predetermined time (6:25 AM system time by default):\necho \"/sbin/shutdown -h 5 'System will reboot in 5 minutes'\" | sudo tee /etc/cron.daily/reboot-me\n\nNotice that rather than just rebooting the system without warning, I'm setting a 5-minute warning, so if anyone is logged in, they have a chance to save their work, or even interrupt the shutdown with sudo shutdown -c, rather than having the system pulled off from under them. You can adjust these accordingly, if you want to give more ample warning (for instance, use shutdown -h 60 and run the command at 2:00 AM and you'll give users a generous 1-hour warning).\nThis is based on my past experience; at some point you will be logged in working when the crontab entry runs, and if it just reboots without warning you'll be a very sad panda.\n\nA: Why do you want - or need to do this? Whilst it's pretty simple to do, there's almost certainly a better solution with Linux which doesn't involve a reboot. Unlike Windows, Linux based OS's don't require reboots for almost anything except kernel upgrades.\nIf you explain what you are trying to achieve we can probably help you better.\n", "Q: Can I change the image of the icons on my taskbar? Am I able to change the images of the currently running programs on my taskbar?

From UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles: \n\nIcon field is the icon that should be used by the launcher and represents the application. All icons that are under the directory /usr/share/pixmaps don't need to have their full path specified, but their filename without the extension.

Yet if i type \"catfish\", up it pops, instantly. I did some googling, did \"sudo apt-get remove catfish --purge\" which removed one file. \nCatfish is still there.\nSince I installed 0.6.4 and previously 0.6.3 from zip files and those files are all in my home folder, I deleted all those files.\nCatfish is still there.\nCan anyone specular as to what's going on?! Thanks.\n\nA: One option would be to go to the folder you installed it from (where the Makefile resides - pretty much where you unzipped it to in the first place, and where you navigated for the initial make install command) and typing sudo make uninstall. Generally speaking this will remove the files that were copied to various places during the installation process (if it's appearing in your Dash then it's unlikely to have only put files into the home folder)\nThe reason the apt-get commands aren't working for you is that you installed from a zip file - apt-get only controls packages downloaded from the repositories, so you can only apt-get remove or apt-get purge packages you apt-get installed in the first place.\n", "Q: how do I correct text sizes on the web?

In both cases, it may have happened when I had to shutdown Bleachbit before it finished executing because it appeared to have frozen (several hours but my drive is not very big). \nIn my case, I had accidentally set it to clean the empty space and, having frozen / killed it during this process, it appears to have left a randomly named folder filled with many many files which, I believe (but don't know for sure), are created as part of the process of wiping the free space on the hard drive. (Nautilus could never actually display the files - it just showed the busy icon while trying to load them so I assume that they were the many files created as a result of the drive cleaning process.)\nAs Mitch said I finally worked out that I could only empty the trash of these files by deleting the hidden directory ~/.local/share/Trash/files.\nCredit to Mitch for answering this question (if he re-posts it as an answer) but I thought my experience would elucidate one possible cause of this problem i.e. if you had to kill Bleachbit, or it crashed, it may have left damaged files behind that could not be normally deleted.\n", "Q: How to permanently set screen brightness level in Ubuntu 12.04 on Dell Vostro 2420 laptop?

It assumes that if you have populated /etc/network/interfaces that you will do the hard work and it will not manage your connections. That is exactly what you see: \"...In the menu bar icon, under Wireless Network, it says 'device not managed'.\" \nIf you wish NM to manage your network connections, remove all the wlan0 entries from /etc/network/interfaces leaving only:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nReboot and NM will take over management.

I have to run my VPN software on my VM Host system and need access to my VPN network from within my Ubuntu VM.\nI can set my VM's network interface to NAT and this takes care of my VPN connectivity issues. I can reach any host inside my work interface via the NAT interface.\nIn addition to my VPN needs, I would like hots on my LAN to connect to my VM. For example, I want to run a NFS server on my VM that another host on my LAN wants to connect to. (Note -- I don't want a remote VPN host to connect to my VM).\nTo allow this, I added a second Bridge network interface to my VM. This works fine and I can reach my VM from any other host on my LAN. \nThe problem with enabling both interfaces is that the NAT interface (VPN) is no longer used, so my VPN hosts becomes unreachable.\nI've tried altering the VMWare settings so that the NAT interface is eth0 and Bridged interface is eth1 and vice-versa without any luck.\nI assume I need to do something with my routing table to tell Ubuntu to route anything to 192.168.99.255 (my LAN) with ethX and everything else through ethY. \nHow do I set these rules up?

I've installed linux kernel v3.4 in Ubuntu 12.04 containing kernel v3.2 using the answer here - Can I install Linux kernel in Ubuntu appart of the default one?\nBut v3.4 is showing strange bugs like inability to move mouse (laptop touchpad), inability to connect to wifi, etc.\nCould you please tell me how to uninstall v3.4 so that the default version in Linux grub becomes v3.2 as before.\n\nA: I'm assuming you used the first option in the answer. To uninstall the 3.4 kernel and keep using the 3.2 kernel:\nYou will have to boot into the 3.2 kernel first, so you are not removing the kernel you are currently using. To do this, you will have to select the appropriate kernel on boot from the Grub menu. If you do not normally see the Grub menu, hold down Shift on boot, and it will appear. Using the arrow keys, scroll to \"Advanced options for Ubuntu [version number]\" and press Enter. Then scroll down to the latest version of the 3.2 kernel, which is 3.2.0-40 if you have that latest version installed. Make sure not to pick Recovery Mode.\nOnce you have booted, open up a terminal and remove all versions of the 3.4 kernel with:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.4.0-* linux-headers-3.4.0-*\n\nThis will not require that you install any additional software such as Synaptic, it will simply remove the kernel. After rebooting, the kernel will be uninstalled.\n\nA: If you used the first option from the answer you indicated, then use synaptic package manager. \nFirst you need to boot from the Original Kernel. If the grub menu does not appear during boot, then hold down Shift key until reveals. From there choose Previous Linux Versions menu (or \"advanced options for Ubuntu\" if you have a newer version than 12.04) and boot from the Original Ubuntu Kernel. \nThen install synaptic package manager. Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+t and issue the following command \nsudo apt-get install -y synaptic\n\nFind and open synaptic (from Dash just write: synaptic) and search for linux-image-3.4.0 and linux-headers-3.4.0. Right click and mark for removal. \n\nHit the apply button to remove the kernel and its headers also. \n", "Q: file permission for website root dirr I have set up a new site on Ubuntu 13.04 with Apache2.

I am wondering what should the permissions on my sites root folder be to provide enough access for day to day needs but still be secure.\n\nA: Maybe the Script to Configure Proper WordPress Permissions will be useful in your case.\nUpdate1: If you looking for more general solution to setup your virtual hosts from template consider control panels like http://www.virtualmin.com/demo \nThe Virtualmin automatically will setup group for domain, virtual host and file permissions on root folder. \nWhen you finish with development stage, you can backup and migrate a domain with ease to production server.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.04 will not respond to keyboard entry of apache ssl passphrase I have a ubuntu machine that will not respond to keyboard entry of a apache ssl passphrase.  It's like the keyboard is not responding at all.  Is there a way I can disable this service from starting during the boot process? How can I use a live cd to disable this pass phrase?\nThanks! \n\nA: I've just come out of such a scenario and what's worse, it took place on a virtual (ESXi 4) client facing server. Here's what I did to get things back up and running for those of you with similar problems.  I didn't find much on the net about this so I hope this helps.  \nFirst, I popped in and booted from a live CD.  From the terminal, I listed all available drives.\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nAfter identifying the correct hard disk - in this case sda1, I mounted it.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/drive1\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/drive1\n\nAt this point, I dug into apache's configs and I figured the quickest/best thing to do would be to turn the SSL engine off temporarily.\nsudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl\n\nYour config may be different.  In the past, I've seen this line in other files such as apache.conf and ports.conf.  Look for the section below, and change 'on' to 'off'.\n#   SSL Engine Switch:\n#   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.\nSSLEngine off\n\nAfter saving, ejecting the disc and restarting, I was able to get back onto the server.  I repeated the above step to turn SSL back on.  \nThis is a confirmed bug that has been resolved.  Solution would be to upgrade apache to at least version 2.2.16-4 according to this bug report.\n", "Q: Appropriate Partition size for dual booting Ubuntu 13.04 with Windows XP MCE I own an old HP Pavilion a1220in PC. The problem is that it came with just 80gb SATA.\nI have Windows XP MCE SP2 pre-installed on it. But I want to dual boot it with Ubuntu 13.04. I checked online for solutions, and I did find the method for it. It doesn't seem much difficult, but the Partition size thingy is confusing me. I have no idea what would be appropriate partition size for both XP and Ubuntu, so that both of them can run whenever I want.\nI have only 23gb's left in my C-Drive. Another Partition already exists, that Windows made itself, about 7gb. There is a Recovery folder with a lock symbol on it. I already have the Recovery Discs, so I don't think that the Partition is necessary.\nThe results for installation of Ubuntu did not tell what would be the appropriate size for Partitions. Will Ubuntu's installation do it itself or is it necessary for me to set it manually? And will this installation affect my Windows installation?\n\nA: XP does not have any internal tools for partitioning, so use gparted from liveCD to shrink it, but reboot XP immediately to let it run chkdsk.\nXP supposedly will work in 10 to 15GB, but you need to have about 30% free space in the NTFS partition for Windows to work well. At 10% free it just about stops working and defrag may take forever.\nHow much space is used in your XP isntall? And can you houseclean some data?\nUbuntu can install in 10GB, some have installed in 5 or 6GB but have to continuously houseclean. If installing Lubuntu or Xubuntu less space is needed and if an older computer Lubuntu may be a better choice. You also need swap equal to RAM if you have 2GB or less of RAM. If you only have 512GB or RAM then you need swap to be 2X RAM and cannot really run full Ubuntu and have to use Lubuntu.\n", "Q: Javascript for ie8 I need to use internet explorer 8 with javascript for a program I need for work.

During reboot, however, when monit tries to start, it checks dns resolution for things in its configuration file (monitrc) but fails.  I had to add a pre-start stanza to get it to loop and keep trying to resolve a dns name before it goes and tries to start monit. It just seems kind of clunky though.  I am guessing this is related to network stuff not starting until a script in /etc/init.d for networking runs and that my monit stuff starts before that unless I use this loop check. I tried:\nstart on (net-device-up IFACE=eth0 and runlevel [2345]), thinking that this would make sure that the interface was up and that we were in a runlevel where networking should at least be running, but that did not help.  Is there some other key word I can put in start on that checks if resolution is available?  Please note my server is not running dns server.\n\nA: You might try starting when networking is up and running.\nstart on started networking\n\nHowever your job is depending on external condition (DNS resolution) therefore loop you created might be inevitable. \nYou should also re-check your monit configuration: The upstart script provided on Monit web site looks straight forward. No mention of problems you are facing.\nCase you haven't done it already check the content of /var/log/upstart/monit.log and debug your script.

While viewing the reports of htop, I would like to know what the orange/brown 'cached memory' bars actually indicate. Really I'm looking for a more practical explanation of what I'm looking at, rather that pure CS terms. Though I'd like to have both. \nWhen I see a large amount of memory being (having already been?) cached, will that have any effect on system performance? What would normally cause the cached memory to increase so much while the used memory (green) stays pretty low? \nHere is a screen capture of an example htop report. \n\n\nA: cached memory is used so that the HDD doesn't have to be read each time you open a file or a folder. So when you cache something it saves a disk read, that saves time and that's why Ubuntu caches as much as possible. \nHaving free memory isn't really good since it's not used, having cached memory will make access times shorter and improves performance. so the cached memory can be viewed as free memory since it's not actually used by any program it's just there to be as a backup of what could be used. \nCached memory + free memory is the same as the available memory, since the cached memory will be cleared if a program needs the space. So having lots of RAM will increase the performance of Ubuntu in general, especially if you are using programs with heavy RAM usage. \n", "Q: \"locate\" process in Ubuntu 12.04 Frequently I have seen in the System Monitor a process called \"locate\", running once a day or more. It consumes a lot a CPU and I do not understand if it is useful or not. Can I configure it to run less times per week? Where could I find more information about it?\nThanks\n\nA: The process 'locate' is a find utility to help you locate certain commands, files, documents, etc. It is useful wherein someone needs to locate a particular file or command on the system. Is this a multi-user system? If so, someone is probably using it to locate what they need.\nThe updatedb command performs the locate update, so using \"locate\" just means that it is in use on the system. you could try to restrict access to the command if it is a real bother.

Any ideas?\n\nA: Since you've enabled the Universe repository, and it still does not work, that suggests that APT has not been updated to use the new configuration. (This can cause the problem you're experiencing even if it has been updated to use the new configuration, but has not been updated since other changes were made.)\nI noticed you didn't mention running sudo apt-get update. It's a good idea to run that before installing software on the command line. If you haven't run that very recently, try that, and then see if you can install the software.\nIf that does not work, then the problem is usually caused by a misconfiguration of your software sources. You could have only parts of the necessary sources enabled, or you could be configured to use software sources that are broken on the server (some mirrors might malfunction or go down), or software sources for the wrong Ubuntu release or for some other operating system altogether.\nSo, if running sudo apt-get update doesn't fix the problem, take a look at the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list. One way to view the contents of that file is to run:\ncat /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIf that doesn't clarify the cause of the problem, or you want help interpreting its contents or checking if they are correct, then please edit your question to include the ful output of that command (and also of lsb_release -a).\n\nA: According to their documentation you need to this:\nsudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose\n\nLink for more information: http://www.scipy.org/install.html\n", "Q: How are kernel modules in /etc/modules determined (because one of mine fails to load)?

I know what dot files or folders are, but there is a specific dot named folder (the name is just a dot) in every directories. What are they used for?\nFor example here is a part of my \"bin\" folder.

It is called the current directory.\n.. means the directory's parent directory, that is, the directory that contains it.\nThere is one directory that is not contained by any other directory: /. So / is special--like all other directories, it contains a .. entry, but its .. entry is itself. So for /, and only for /, .. and . are equivalent.\nThese directory entries are handy for a variety of purposes. For example, you can change directory to the parent of the directory you're currently in with the command cd ...\nYou may have seen . in the context of running programs or scripts. In a Unix-style shell, when you run a command by name, the shell doesn't automatically try to run a program by the name in the current directory. (This is surprising to some users coming from Windows, where traditionally that would happen.) The main reason for this is security--if someone creates a program in their directory that has the same name as some system administration tool, and you run that tool while in their directory, they could have just tricked you into running their program.\nSo, to run a program that is not in your PATH, you must call it by some name that has a / in it. To run a program in the current directory, you can use ./program. (You cannot use /program, because that is an absolute path and means \"the file called program in the root directory, /.\")\n\nA: . means the current directory.\n.. means the parent directory. \nSo when you type cd ..   , you will move one level up. \nWhen you type cp /etc/resolv.conf . , you will copy file /etc/resolv.conf in the current directory.\n\nA: The single dot represents the current directory. The double dot represents the parent directory. Typing \"cd ..\" will take you to the parent directory.

Vertical orientation is available through the dropdown at the right end of the toolbar (Orientation/Vertical).\nYou can of course add furigana using the same method, by shrinking the text and aligning it appropriately. It can be a bit tedious for a bunch of text though, so another idea I had was to use the formatting available in latex, build a pdf and then import that into Inkscape.

It is incorrect to list package names after autoremove; they will be ignored (and all eligible packages will be removed), which is probably not what you intend.\n\n*--purge causes systemwide configuration files associated with packages being removed to be removed as well. It must be accompanied by a command, such as remove or autoremove. The --purge flag modifies the action of a command; it does not act on its own.\n\n*purge means the same thing as --purge remove (which is the same as remove --purge). It is incorrect to say purge twice; the second purge is interpreted as the name of a package to be purged, which is probably not what you intend.\n\nFull Answer\nTo understand what those commands do and how they are different, it helps (and is probably even essential) to understand two concepts:\n\n*\n\n*the distinction between manually installed and automatically installed packages\n\n*the distinction between a package's package files and its configuration files\nManually Installed vs. Automatically Installed\nAn installed package is either manually or automatically installed.\nWhen you specify a package for installation, and it is installed, it is manually installed.\nBut other packages may also be installed. Most packages have dependencies--other packages that must be installed, for those package to work as intended. When you install a package, its dependencies (i.e., the other packages that it depends on) are installed, except for the ones that were installed before.\nWhen a package is not specified by you to be installed, but instead is installed as a dependency of a package you specified to install, the it is automatically installed.\nPlease note that when you have two packages installed and one of them is a dependency of another, that does not mean the dependency is automatically installed. It's also possible that the dependency was manually installed (i.e., specified by you, for example, installed before or at the same time as the package that depends on it).\nFinally:\n\n*\n\n*If you try to manually install a package that is already installed, it remains installed. But if it was automatically installed, a change is made--trying to manually install it will mark it as manually installed.\n\n*You can mark any package as manually or automatically installed (with the apt-mark command), no matter how or under what circumstances they were actually installed.\n\n*Packages that come preinstalled with your Ubuntu system are not all automatically installed; some of them come marked automatically installed and others come marked manually installed. This is to satisfy the logic behind distinguishing between manually and automatically installed packages--the idea that some packages are only needed in service of others.\n\nTypically, for every automatically installed package you will have at least one manually installed package that depends on it (and which caused it to be automatically installed). However, if you then remove all the manually installed packages that depend on an automatically installed package, the automatically installed package will no longer be necessary, but will still be installed.\napt-get autoremove removes automatically installed packages that no longer have any manually installed packages depending on them.\nPackage Files and Configuration Files\nA package provides files that are intended to be, and to remain, the same on every system where that version of that package is installed. Such files provide executables, resources, documentation, and other \"assets\" for installed programs. We usually just called these \"the files\" that a package provides.\nBut a package provides other files, too, which are intended to (possibly) be changed. These are called global (or systemwide) configuration files. They are almost always installed in the /etc directory, and they can be automatically and manually modified to change the behavior of installed programs. For example, sudo has a configuration file /etc/sudoers, and a directory for more configuration files /etc/sudoers.d. That file, and any files added to that directory, specify who is allowed to use sudo in what ways.\nTypically it is desired that uninstalling a package and then installing it back should not change the way it behaves (unless its package files were corrupt and that's why you reinstalled it, of course). Therefore, typically when a package is uninstalled, its package files are deleted but its systemwide configuration files are left untouched.\nWhen you uninstall a package without specifying that its systemwide configuration files are also supposed to be deleted, that is called \"removing\" the package.\nIf you also want to delete a package's systemwide configuration files when you uninstall the package, that is called \"purging\" the package.\napt-get remove will remove a package; that is, it will uninstall the package but leave its systemwide configuration files.\napt-get purge will purge a package; that is, it will uninstall the package and also make sure to delete its systemwide configuration files.\nAnother way to purge packages is to use the --purge flag. That doesn't tell apt-get what to do; instead, it modifies what terms (or \"commands\") like remove tell it to do. The --purge flag causes any package uninstallations to be accompanied by the deletion of systemwide configuration files for the package(s) being uninstalled. In other words, the --purge flag turns removals into purges.\nWhy do we have the --purge flag when we have the purge command? After all, isn't sudo apt-get --purge  remove packagename equivalent to sudo apt-get purge packagename. They are equivalent. Where --purge comes in handy is when you want to modify the behavior of commands other than remove.\nFor example, suppose you want to uninstall automatically installed packages that are no longer needed (because there are no longer any manually installed packages depending on them), but you don't just want to remove these automatically installed packages, you also want to delete their systemwide configuration files. Then you could run:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove\n\nLet's consider one more use of --purge. There is a flag called --reinstall, which turns installations into reinstallations. This is to say that, normally, when you try to install a package that is already installed, either nothing will happen, or (if the package is marked automatically installed) the package will be marked manually installed. But with the --reinstall flag, installing a package that is already installed causes it to be removed and then installed back:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install packagename\n\nBut suppose you want to delete the systemwide configuration files of the package you're reinstalling. This is somewhat common; when a package is not working and you don't know why, you might try reinstalling it, and also deleting its configuration files so that its configuration is reset to the default. To achieve this, you can run:\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install packagename\n\nThe --reinstall turns installation into reinstallation (i.e., removal followed by installation), and the --purge turns the removal part of reinstallation into purging.\nThe Behavior of Your Examples\nNow it should be clear exactly what each of your example apt-get commands do:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove --purge packagenames\nThis purges automatically installed packages that no longer have any manually installed packages that depend on them. That is, it uninstalls those packages (which entails deleting their package files), and it deletes their systemwide configuration files too.\nHere, packagenames does nothing. In particular, if you intended to just remove packages whose names are listed there, then this will not behave as you intend.\n\n\n*sudo apt-get remove --purge packagenames\nThis purges packagenames; assuming packagenames is a whitespace-separated list of package names, it will purge all of them. That is, it will uninstall them (which entails deleting their package files), and will also delete their systemwide configuration files.\nIf any of the packages listed in packagenames is not installed, its presence in the list will have no effect (except that you will be informed it was not installed). If you list package names that are not the name of any actual package, the command will fail with an unable to locate packagename error.\n\n\n*sudo apt-get purge purge packagenmaes\nIf you removed one of the occurrences of purge in that command, it would be equivalent to the previous one. As it stands, it tries to purge a package called purge, and also to purge the packages listed in packagenames. Since purge is not the name of any package, it will fail with an error message.\n\n\n*sudo apt-get remove packagenames\nThis removes the packages listed in packagenames, which entails deleting their package files. This does not delete their systemwide configuration files (because it is merely a removal, not a purge).\n\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove\nThis uninstalls automatically installed packages that no longer have any manually installed packages that depend on them. This entails deleting their package files, but not their systemwide configuration files (that is, it is a removal but not a purge).\nFor more information about how to use apt-get, I recommend its manual page.

It said I have to first uninstall previous LibreOffice but I don't know how to do uninstall it.\n\nA: If you want to install a package on top of another one, system package management tools should take care of it, so you could locate your package, say its called libreoffice.deb, and just run\nsudo dpkg -i libreoffice.deb\n\nIf the package is indeed the same application but another version than the one installed, you will read in the terminal that the package you are installing will be unpacked as a replacement.\nIf you still need to remove the previous package, or you just want to know how to remove a package, the following command is what you're looking for:\nsudo apt-get remove libreoffice*\n\n(The asterisk will make match all packages whose name start with libreoffice, like libreoffice-3.0 for example.

See https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2182302 for discussions on this.\nTo workaround this bug you will need to take a few extra steps.\nWorkaround\n\n*\n\n*When you boot from the LiveUSB in UEFI mode, use the Try Ubuntu\nwithout Installing option.\n\n*Open the Gparted application when the Ubuntu desktop starts.\n\n*Select the Windows (first) drive within Gparted at the top right\ncorner(1):\n\n\nThe NVME drive in this picture does not have Windows. However, it has an EFI System Partition (ESP).\n\n\n*Highlight the ESP in the bottom list of partitions as shown above (2). Right click on the highlighted partition and select Manage Flags from the context menu. You will see:\n\n\nYou should see two flags, boot and esp checked. Uncheck those two flags. Click Close button to exit the Manage Flag window. Click the green \"Apply\" ✅ button if it is clickable.\nYou will need to restore those check marks once Ubuntu is installed using the same above process so that Windows can boot from the first drive.\nClose Gparted.\nThis is the end of the workaround.\nOriginal Answer\nSee How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator)\nEven though it is for USB key, the same principle applies for the USB Hard drive. Pay extra attention to the second answer. The relevant parts are noted below:\nDuring install choose \"Something Else\"\n\nPartition and format the USB drive\nAfter having chosen Something else the graphical partition manager GParted will guide us through the partitioning process:\n\n\n*\n\n*At this point take extra care that the boot loader Grub indeed will\nbe installed to the USB drive (/sda in the picture, but yours will be different) and not to anywhere else\nSee the bottom of the image above, and make your selection where it says: Device for bootloader installation. The bootloader is another name for the GRUB. It should be installed in the MBR of the external USB hard drive and not in one of its partition.\nYou will need at least one ext4 partition with a mount point root (/). In the example above an additional /home (also ext4) partition was created. If in the future you need to reinstall Ubuntu, by unticking Format box you can keep the data in /home partition. You will also want a small swap partition of 4GB size (not shown in the picture) with no mount point, in its own Linux/Swap format to be used as virtual memory.\nhope this helps\n\nA: Simply install grub to the external usb device instead of to your internal hard disk.  Leave the boot order with the internal hard disk before the usb, and you should have the setup you described.\n  Other answers have indicated that the \"Device for Bootloader Installation\" is the place to enter for grub.  HOWEVER, if you have an UEFI machine, the world has changed, and the installer will just ignore any device entered there -- I head you need to enter the (EFI) partition as the location, instead of the device (e.g. /dev/sdc2 instead of /dev/sdc)  \n\nA: You don't need to have grub on the external device, just have the external device be bootable.\nThis can be done from within Windows using the Universal USB Installer, available here: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/.

I recently upgraded to UBUNTU 13.04. Prior to the upgrade I was effectively using xrdp to access my unity 2d (gnome-fallback-session) desktop from my windows 7 client. With the upgrade my understanding is that the gnome-fallback-session is no longer available under 13.04, and further the xrdp server could not handle the unity desktop over a remote session. \nAs an alternative I am using a tunneled xvnc connection to establish a remote desktop connection between my windows 7 machine and ubuntu 13.04 workstation. Briefly, (i) connect via ssh to the server (ii) startup xvnc server via sudo x11vnc -display :1 -auth guess -q and (iii) use realVNC vncviewer application to access the remote desktop. With this approach I can manage some work, but the connection is awfully slow with bad geometry. Firstly, the refresh rate severely hinders delivery of the remote desktop to the client viewer, although I've already disabled some of the effects & animations in unity. Second, I have very limited control over the geometry of the desktop, thus even scaled down to fit the geometry of the client display the result is a very condensed and disproportional remote desktop view.\nI would appreciate any suggestions to either (a) improving the xvnc experience or (b) alternative (but straightforward) solutions for remote desktop access.\nThanks in advance\nKam\n\nA: Unity is only running smooth with hardware 3D acceleration. Since VNC is running its own X11 server without conventional graphics output, you cannot expect to get decent performance. If I understand the xrdp website correctly, xrdp suffers from the same issue (since it uses xvnc to manage the x11 session).\nI only see one possible solution: avoid running a 3D desktop environment through your remote connection:\nYou could, instead of running a full remote desktop, just forward X11 on a per window basis. For this, you'll need an X11 server for Windows (for instance Xming, or the one from the Cygwin repos, or MobaXterm,...). If you are running an ssh client from a command line, you can enable X11 forwarding with the \"-X\" argument (or \"-Y\" for trusted X11 forwarding, meaning that you trust the server computer you are connecting to) In putty you can enable X11 forwarding by clicking a checkbox:\n\nIf this is enabled, you should be able to start all X11 programs from command line in putty and get their output on your local screen.\nIf you insist on using a full remote desktop,  I'd suggest to install a 2D window manager. If you want a full desktop environment, you can try lxde, xfce, kde (with desktop effects disabled!). If you just need just a lightweight window manager, try sawfish, openbox, blackbox, fluxbox, mwm, twm,...

I do not think this can be done with Linux tools alone, correct me if I'm wrong... You can run from CLI or via GUI from the right click context menu (just right click volume C then look for tools.)\nThe process is non destructive to your data. I assume if you had RAID, you'd know. If after running CHKDSK, problem persists, suspect hardware failure (let's hope not.)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHKDSK\n", "Q: Copying multiple specific files from one folder to another I have a large folder of pictures (thousands), and I have a long list of files, by exact file name, that I need to copy to another folder. I want to know if there is a way I can select several specific files from this folder, by name, and copy them to another folder, using the terminal, without copying them individually?\n\nA: Here's a pure bash solution. It will read file names from an input file (one per line) and copy each of them, renaming duplicates. \n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n## The destination folder where your files will\n## be copied to.\ndest=\"bar\";\n\n## For each file path in your input file\nwhile read path; do \n    ## $target is the name of the file, removing the path. \n    ## For example, given /foo/bar.txt, the $target will be bar.txt.\n    target=$(basename \"$path\"); \n    ## Counter for duplicate files\n    c=\"\"; \n    ## Since $c is empty, this will check if the\n    ## file exists in target.\n    while [[ -e \"$dest\"/\"$target\"$c ]]; do\n        echo \"$target exists\"; \n        ## If the target exists, add 1 to the value of $c\n        ## and check if a file called $target$c (for example, bar.txt1)\n        ## exists. This loop will continue until $c has a value\n        ## such that there is no file called $target$c in the directory.\n        let c++; \n        target=\"$target\"$c; \n    done; \n    ## We now have everything we need, so lets copy.\n    cp \"$path\" \"$dest\"/\"$target\"; \ndone\n\nSave this script in a folder in your $PATH and call it with the list of paths as input:\nauto_copy.sh < file_paths.txt\n\nYou can also run the entire thing as a command from the terminal:\nwhile read path; do \n   target=$(basename \"$path\"); \n   c=\"\"; \n   while [[ -e bar/\"$target\"$c ]]; do \n    echo \"$target exists\"; \n    let c++; \n    target=\"$target\"$c; \n   done; \n   cp \"$file\" bar/\"$target\"; \ndone < file_names;\n\n\nA: Simply copy multiple files at once from command line\nThere are several ways you could achieve this. The easiest I have seen is to use the following.\ncp /home/usr/dir/{file1,file2,file3,file4} /home/usr/destination/\n\nThe syntax uses the cp command followed by the path to the directory the desired files are located in with all the files you wish to copy wrapped in brackets and separated by commas.\nMake sure to note that there are no spaces between the files. The last part of the command, /home/usr/destination/, is the directory you wish to copy the files into.\nor if the all the files have the same prefix but different endings you could do something like this:\ncp /home/usr/dir/file{1..4} ./\n\nWhere file1,file2,file3 and file4 would be copied.\nFrom how you worded the question I believe this is what you're looking for but it also sounds like you might be looking for a command to read from a list of files and copy all of them to a certain directory. If that is the case let me know and i'll edit my answer.\nDealing with duplicates with python\nSo I wrote a little python script that I believe should get the job done. However, I am not sure how well versed you are in python (if versed at all) so I will try explaining how to use this script the best I can and please ask as many questions about it as you need.\nimport os,sys,shutil\n### copies a list of files from source. handles duplicates.\ndef rename(file_name, dst, num=1):\n    #splits file name to add number distinction\n    (file_prefix, exstension) = os.path.splitext(file_name)\n    renamed = \"%s(%d)%s\" % (file_prefix,num,exstension)\n\n    #checks if renamed file exists. Renames file if it does exist.\n    if os.path.exists(dst + renamed):\n        return rename(file_name, dst, num + 1)\n    else:\n        return renamed\n\ndef copy_files(src,dst,file_list):\n    for files in file_list:\n        src_file_path = src + files\n        dst_file_path = dst + files\n        if os.path.exists(dst_file_path):\n            new_file_name =  rename(files, dst)\n            dst_file_path = dst + new_file_name\n            \n        print \"Copying: \" + dst_file_path\n        try:\n            shutil.copyfile(src_file_path,dst_file_path)\n        except IOError:\n            print src_file_path + \" does not exist\"\n            raw_input(\"Please, press enter to continue.\")\n\ndef read_file(file_name):\n    f = open(file_name)\n    #reads each line of file (f), strips out extra whitespace and \n    #returns list with each line of the file being an element of the list\n    content = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]\n    f.close()\n    return content\n\nsrc = sys.argv[1]\ndst = sys.argv[2]\nfile_with_list = sys.argv[3]\n\ncopy_files(src,dst,read_file(file_with_list))\n\nThis script should be relatively simple to use. First off, copy the above code into the program gedit (should be pre-installed in Ubuntu) or any other text editor.\nAfter that is complete, save the file as move.py in your home directory (it can be any directory but for ease of instruction lets just use the home directory) or add the directory the file is contained in to your PATH. Then cd to your home directory (or whatever directory you saved move.py in) from the terminal and type the following command:\npython move.py /path/to/src/ /path/to/dst/ file.txt\n\nThis should copy all of the files that are listed from the source directory to the destination directory with duplicates taking the format pic(1).jpg, pic(2).jpg and so on.\nfile.txt should be a file that lists all the pictures you would like to copy with each entry on its own separate line.\nIn no way should this script effect the source directory, however just make sure to enter the correct paths to the source and destination directory and the worst that could happen is you copy the files to the wrong directory.\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*This script assumes that all of the original pictures are in the same\ndirectory. If you want it to check sub directories as well the script\nwill need to be modified.\n\n*If you accidentally mistype a file name, the script will spit out the error\n\"file does not exist\" and prompt you to \"press enter\" to continue and the script will continue copying the rest of the list.\n\n*Don't forget the trailing / on both the path to the source\ndirectory and path to the destination directory. Otherwise the script\nwill spit an error back at you.\n\n\nA: As per description of the question, my understanding is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*there is a list of files, presumably a text file input.txt\n\n*the list contains filenames only\n\n*there is a particular directory where these filenames are located.\n\n\nThus, one can make use the following command:\nxargs -I % --arg-file=input.txt cp  /path/to/origin_dir/%  /path/to/destination\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*-I % specifies symbol for currently processed file to be used within command \n\n*--arg-file=input.txt specifies to take arguments to command from input.txt\n\n*cp /path/to/origin_dir/% /path/to/destination/ will perform cp command with /path/to/origin_dir/% being replaced with /path/to/origin_dir/ and name of currently processed file.\n\n\nPractical example:\n$ cat input.txt\nfile2.txt\nfile1.txt\nfile3.txt\n$ ls ./docs\nfile1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt\n$ xargs -I % --arg-file=input.txt cp ./docs/% ./docs_destination/\n$ ls ./docs_destination/\nfile1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt\n\n\nA: From cp --help:\ncp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY\n\nThe SOURCE... with three commas means multiple params i.e. you can just make\ncd your_source_dir\ncp file1 file2 dest_dir\n\n\nA: Perhaps I'm missing a detail of your question, but the answers given seem excessive. If you want a command line solution and not a script, why not:\ncd /path/to/src/\ncp -t /path/to/dst/ file1 file2 file3 ...\n\nThe nice thing about doing it this way is that you can tab complete the file names\n\nA: Having hit this a few times, my solution is a small script to cp everything into a folder so it looks exactly like I want the archive (folders and all), then cd <folder_to_be_zipped> and zip -r ../<zip_file_name>.zip . and I will end up with a .zip where I want it, having exactly the structure I want.\nAnother way is to use multiple zip commands such as:\ncd <parent_of_directory> && zip -r /path/to/archive.zip directory/* && \\\ncd <folder_with_files> && zip /path/to/archive.zip addfile1 addfile2 addfile2;\n\nSamples courtesy of: https://wpguru.co.uk/2018/12/how-to-add-files-to-an-existing-zip-archive-on-macos-and-linux/\n\nA: Here the command for not specific file but you can copy or move all files from one directory to another directory.\nRun below command\nfind path/to/origin/dir -type f -print0 | xargs -0 cp -t path/to/destination/dir\nfor move all the files, replace cp to mv in the above command\n", "Q: gnome-terminal does not allow changing the title I've selected \"Replace initial title\" setting in gnome-terminal's preferences, but it just shows the default title \"Terminal\".

You said, \"it started to show user@hostname: ~/currentdir in its title, changing it whenever I cd to another directory\", but the image attached said something else. I am almost sure that if you've selected \"Replace initial title\" setting in gnome-terminal's preferences and if you use this ~/.bashrc file as you said, your terminal should look like in the following image:\n\nSecond, you're totally wrong with: \"vim, for example, sets current filename as a title\".

It works with other operating systems too, at least when there is a filesystem-type support in Ubuntu (or another Live CD distro for that matter), so you may for example copy data from crashed Windows too.\nJust boot the Live CD, mount the disks, plug in a USB key or an external USB hard drive, and copy the data.\nThis being the preferred way for many people, you may do just the same thing without GUI, so that you don't have to use a Live CD, just the OS you have installed - USB keys or drives usually pop up at /media/ and you may use Midnight Commander (sudo apt-get install mc) or just cp the data to the external drive.\n", "Q: Apt-get dist-upgrade wants to destroy my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS This morning I have issued a command I use fairly often:\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nUsually it finds little to do, some times it will replace the kernel and headers.\nWith my great surprise today it responded this way:\nroot@xxxxx:~# apt-get dist-upgrade\nReading package lists...

Also, it says it's removing grub?\nSince I had a very fresh backup I tried going ahead and guess what, it indeed destroyed my server and it could not boot any more.\nWhat's the deal with this?\nAlso, why does udev say that it wants sysv-rc version 2.88dsf-24 when all I have installed is 2.88dsf-13.10ubuntu11.1? It looks like some repository is doing something nuts. All I have installed of \"odd\" are repos for PHP FPM 5.4+, mysql, nginx and varnish. They were added more than 1 month ago as well and never gave an issue with dist-upgrade.\n\nA: The problem with udev/sysv-rc came from the fact that udev is now built from systemd sources and my PPA (ppa:ondrej/systemd) was not updated with newer sysvinit (that provides sysv-rc).\nThat has been fixed as of today, but I still would advice to test the upgrade in non-production environment first before deploying it on the server you care about.\n", "Q: Unable to install asterisk on Ubuntu 12.10 I am working on a openbts project.\nI tried to install asterisk on 12.10 by watching a video.\nBut it is showing that it is not able to unlock a 'lock' file. in \n    var/lib/dpkg/lock\nSo i wanted some help on how to go about the installation of asterisk on ubuntu 12.10?\n\nA: Try this command:    \nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\nThen this:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nAfter this, retry the installation \n", "Q: Script for initiating ssh connection for port forwarding, and then execute vnc viewer on client's computer I would like to write a script that gets as an argument a local computer ip (on the network of the ssh server), and forwards port 5900 on the client's computer to that ip:5900 on the server network. \nRight after the connection is established I would like to execute vnc viewer and connect to that remote host, using the port forwarded.\nThe script I came up with is as followed:\n#/bin/bash\nssh -L 5900:${1}:5900 user@server-ip\nvncviewer 127.0.0.1:5900\n\nAnd it should be used like that: \nSay we have on the server's network a computer with ip 10.0.0.10, so executing the command:\nvnc-ssh-script 10.0.0.10\n\non my home (client) computer is supposed to open up the vnc viewer and allow me to control the local network computer 10.0.0.10 (which runs vnc server ofcourse).\nOnly problem is that after the first line of the script is executed (ssh -L 5900:${1}:5900 user@server-ip), the connection is established and the next command (vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5900) won't be executed until the ssh session is closed...\nMy question is how can I establish the task I want?\nI already tried appending '&' after the ssh command, but then when I execute the script I get the message:  \"Psedo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.\"  and it seems like that ssh is automatically closed (and even if it did work, I would have an indication that it succeeded before executing the vncviewer command).\n\nA: You have to stick the SSH connection in the background. The ampersand at the end of the command does that and I'm passing in the N flag too to stop a shell running on the remote end (saves a handful of resources and stops SSH getting stroppy about having a console connected):\n#/bin/bash\nssh -NL 5900:${1}:5900 user@${1} &\nsleep 1\nvncviewer 127.0.0.1:5900\n\nI used to do something similar but run x11vnc on the remote computer, on demand.

On my Android phone (4.1.2), I go to Settings, Wireless and Networks then mobile network sharing. Then I can enable the portable wifi hotspot.\nYou can probably get a more detailed answer here: https://android.stackexchange.com/\n\nA: Typically, there are options under Settings/more settings on Samsung Touchwiz software. There should be the option of wifi hotspot, and probably tethering through USB/bluetooth. Note that typically with Linux, no extra drivers or installation is necessary for the built in USB tethering.\nSome carriers block this unless you pay an extra fee, however. In that case, if rooted, you have the option of custom ROMs or extra apps that can give you that functionality, be it through wifi or USB. You can also use adb port forwarding through the client PC's command line.

The reason being that I have a terrible habit of opening many terminal windows at once and it's a hassle to go through each of them and quit all of them individually. Simply typing exeunt (because let's face it, there's no better name for a command to \"exit all\") and having them all quit would be far better for me. However, I don't want to accidentally close any programs that are still running from within a terminal - I still want to see any \"There is still a process running in this terminal\" prompts, so the command killall gnome-terminal would be out of the question.\nThe ideal I suppose would be a command-line / bash equivalent of rightclicking on the Dash icon and pressing \"quit\". Possibly a slightly unorthodox request, but I'd be interested to know if it's somehow possible.\n\nA: Despite it's name, killall (and kill) sends SIGTERM signal to all the process with the same name, also you can personalize the signal sent with the -s switch. So, instead using killall gnome-terminal you can use killall -s {signal} gnome-terminal.\nI haven't find out what signal can be interpreted as click at the close button, but my guess is, that it's a GUI hook that trigger such behavior. In gnome2 there was a \"Close all\" option in the task list, but in gnome3 seems such option it's lost.\nAfter a lengthy discussion over U&L\nWith the help of slm who gave me the idea, you can simulate the alt + F4 key combination on several instances of gnome-terminal using xdotool search --name terminal key --window %@ alt+F4. You must be sure you have installed xdotool using:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nBut, lets me explain in detail:\nsearch do a search of all window with a determinated characteristics. --name switch will look for windows with the content on the title bar. key tells xdotool that we are going to use keyboard commands. --window tells to use a determinated ID for the key command, if not set it will use %1 from the stack. %@ means to use all the stack of ID's. alt+F4 tells the key combination to send.\nMore information:\nwww.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/xdotool.xhtml\n", "Q: How can I remap \"special\" keys in xkb?

Short version\nI know this question is very similar to others and I did really search the Internet for answers, but it seems that no approach is working or the solutions seem to be \"to complicated to be best practice\" (I'll try to explain). I'm looking for a safe way on how to disable DHCP from command line (to use in scripts).\nBackground\nI'm trying to create a \"Live-Cd\" with Ubuntu Server 12.04 and remastersys (works well). The system is, by default, configured to get the IP with DHCP while booting. \nThat's ok - the important thing is that a script (which runs after booting) is able (in some specific cases) to set a static IP using ifconfig (not /etc/network/interfaces ): \nifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1\n\nActually this is also working, but the IP only persists until the DHCP lease time of the previously obtained lease is over. A new IP will be assigned to eth0, which (in short) breaks the system.\nI thought \"no big deal, there will be surely something like: \"\n\nifconfig eth0 dhcpdisabled\n\nBut I ended up recognizing, it doesn't work that easy. Editing the /etc/network/interfaces is a bit tricky, because it is generated by remastersys (actually the 23networking script of casper). \nI could rewrite it and restart networking, but what will happen to active dhclient.leases? Will be DHClient still be running in the background (it shouldn't but some posts suggest it will be my tests showed it is restarted “randomly“, if dhclient is killed), do I have to remove or empty dhclient.leases files, what about resolv.conf?\nDespair\nTo sum it up - In my opinion it's not really that \"straightforward\" and somewhat doesn't \"feel stable\". This question (156183)  suggested to remove the dhclient package, but: Will this solve the problem? Will this break other stuff? \nIs there really no command for this? I hope I just overlooked it.\n\nA: I'll try to give you a brief example of what you can do, but it's not complete example because the exact setup, needs etc can differ quite a lot.\nFirst, lets make some assumptions to make this case more simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're not using network-manager \n\n*You're not using resolvconf, but static /etc/resolv.conf file\n\n*Your interfaces file does not contain allow-hotplug lines to reconfigure if cable is unplugged/plugged.\n\n\nLet's setup our helper variable DEV\n## your device is eth0\n# stop /etc/interface control of the eth0 device, should also stop/kill dhcp for that device\nifdown eth0\n## stop dhclient to be sure, don't worry about leases files etc\npkill dhclient\n## ubuntu precise calls dhclient with dhclient3\npkill dhclient3\n# set ip manually: (NETMASK is quite often 24 == 255.255.255.0) \nifconfig eth0 up 192.168.0.1/NETMASK\n# do you need default gw? (for this example it's 192.168.0.254)\nroute add default gw  192.168.0.254\n\n## if your /etc/resolv.conf is incorrect add correct nameserver like this:\n### 8.8.8.8 = goole open dns\necho 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' > /etc/resolv.conf\n\nNow if assumption 1) is false do (stop network-manager):\nstop network-manager\n\nFor assumption 2) either remove resolvconf or remove /etc/resolv.conf if it's a symlink and replace it with static file\n[ -h /etc/resolv.conf ] && rm /etc/resolv.conf\n\nAnd for assumption 3): This should comment out hotplug lines.. and I hope it's enough\nperl -i -pe 's/^(\\s*allow-hotplug)/# $1/g' /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\nA: You can use \"systemctl\" if available for your distro. It is available for my openSUSE distribution, and I use it to disable the services in the follwoing way.\nsystemctl disable wickedd-dhcp4.service\n\nwhere wickedd-dhcp4 is name of the service handling DHCP client configuration on my system. There is also a service for IPv6 dhcp configuration, you migh wan't to disable that too.\nsystemctl disable wickedd-dhcp6.service\n\n\nA: The easiest standard way to fix this is simple: just tell your DHCP server which IPs should be given to certain MAC addresses. Every router I've ever touched has had this feature and if you're using dhcp3-server, it's just as simple.\n\nA: What about simply stopping the dhcp-client with pkill dhclient?\n\nA: I use the following command to disable DHCP on my server.\nsudo update-rc.d -f dhcp3-server remove\n\nWhat it does is remove any system startup links for /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server.\nSo that on next reboot DHCP does not kick in.\nThat's it , simple clean, easy and safe.\n", "Q: Mount.cifs vs. SMBClient I am using Ubuntu 13.04 to connect to a Windows 2008 Server:\nIf I use\nmount.cifs //server/share /mnt/mountpoint -o username=domain/credentials\n\nI successfully connect, but if I try to cp a file, I get access is denied.\nIf I use\nsmbclient //server/share -o domain/credentials\n\nI can successfully 'put' the file on the server.\nWhy does mount.cifs fail but SMBClient work?\n\nA: It will work if you add write permissions for your user on /mnt/mountpoint. One way would be chown username /mnt/mountpoint\n\nA: In case that normally the mount on console is done for more than on user, you should prefer to set the write permissions and not the ownership of the mount point.\nchmod 775 /path/to/mountpoint\nHave a look that the user has to be also in group, otherwise (net preferred) you have to set 777 as global rights.\nIf you just want to use mounts on a per user base, you can use FUSE filesystem and mount via gvfs (if using gnome) via your desktop. Look for fusemount, so mounting is also possible on a per user basis.\n\nA: Sounds like a permissions problem, be sure your samba user can write to the directory. Did you mount using sudo?\nTry to cp with sudo.\n", "Q: upload freeware program to ubuntu software center I am trying to upload a freeware program in ubuntu software center but it says that only paid programms can be uploaded. Why? How do i upload a freeware program.\n\nA: You can't just upload to Software Center, you need to have your app evaluated, and then once approved, it will be published. \nSee Ubuntu Developer\n", "Q: single line group of commands as individual? I made one small alias and got a question as , how to execute a single line group of commands as command by command with out breaking it ?  \necho \" alias get='sudo apt-get install'\" >> .bashrc & bash\n\nhere we have commands as echo & bash. even placing them all in a single line i want to execute them command by command.\nUpdate: for example if there is a group command line as \ncommand1 ; command 2; command 3; command 4; commmand5\nThen I want to execute this group command not in a single step. 1st 3 commands at a time and then next 2 commands . But condition is I have to write all those commands in a single line.\n\nA: You should be able to do what you have in mind by using command grouping, which allows you to execute commands together, in this case, whether they succeed or not, i.e. in the form { cmd; cmd; }. More information on command grouping and the use of && and || logical operators is available at the Bash wiki and in the Bash reference manual.\nI thought initially the form your command-line could take would be: \n{ cmd1; cmd2; cmd3; }; sleep 1; { cmd4; cmd5;}\n\nThe sleep command just gives a pause and can be removed.\nHowever, you say you want an extra return, or confirmation for the last two commands, and so to achieve that you need to interrupt the command flow in the example above- sleep merely pauses, but regardless the last two commands always execute.\nTo really halt the command chain, you could use read -p..... which requires user intervention to continue. Here is what you could do:\n1) Execute the first three commands, then give the user the opportunity or not to execute the last ones. You could see if the oneliner I have written below is suitable:\nNote: Please substitute the id command for your own commands.\nid; id; id; read -p \"Execute final two commands? (Y/N) \" ans; if [[ $ans =~ Y|y ]]; then id; id; else echo \"Finished\"; fi\n\nNow the first three commands execute and then you need to press y and return for the last two to execute, but all the commands are on the same line. This is about as much as I can contrive really, as I am not quite sure what you want.\n\nA: & runs the left hand side command in the background. If you want to run the second command only if the previous one ran successfully, use\n command1 && command2\n\nIf you want to run the second command even if the previous one is not successful, use\ncommand1 ; command2\n\n\nA: echo \" alias get='sudo apt-get install'\" >> .bashrc && bash\nJust put 2 ampersands and it works.\n\nA: If you want to run them in sequence, the best way would be to use the double ampersand &&. This is often used, for example, when running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade.\nThe && requires that the first command runs successfully before starting the second. So in the example I gave, it updates the package list, and then upgrades packages but only if the updating was successful.\nThe single ampersand is useful if you want to orphan a program from its terminal, so that the program stays open even if the active terminal is closed, by using e.g. nautilus & disown.\n", "Q: GTK+ compiling problem When I try to compile GTimer 2.00\n I get the following error:\n$ ./configure\n\nchecking for GTK+ - version >= 2.4.0... no\n*** Could not run GTK+ test program, checking why...\n*** The test program failed to compile or link.

I automatically installed my Epson Stylus NX420 using the \"add printer\" feature. It was super easy and I was thrilled to prove that Ubuntu defied the typical stereotype of printer support issues, or so I thought. I tried to print something and the printer went absolutely crazy.

This happens in all software, Shotwell, Gimp, Darktable etc.\nThe problem has happened after I did a clean reinstall of Xubuntu. I did not have this problem before reinstalling.\nAnyone got an idea?\nExample\n\n\nA: This is due to LibRaw, the library Shotwell relies upon for RAW processing.  LibRaw is based on dcraw.\nWe've seen this problem pop up on various cameras over the years.  The problem is usually solved in dcraw at some point, at which point the code migrates to LibRaw, where it's eventually available to Shotwell.  It may be that dcraw / LibRaw still doesn't process your camera's images correctly; it just depends when the authors fix these problems.\nWhat to do?  First, I recommend upgrading to the newest version of Shotwell and LibRaw if possible.  I don't know what version of Xubuntu you're using, so I don't know if that requires upgrading your operating system.  You can find the latest version of Shotwell at Yorba's PPA: https://launchpad.net/~yorba/+archive/ppa  Even if your version of Xubuntu has an old copy, you may be able to upgrade to the latest (0.14.1) through our PPA.\nSecond, if that doesn't work or you can't upgrade easily, you should try changing the RAW Developer to Camera in Shotwell.  This is available by selecting the photo and choosing Photos -> Developer -> Camera.  If you see this problem with all your RAW photos, I suggest changing the default RAW Developer to Camera in Edit -> Preferences.\nThe Camera Developer uses the RAW file's built-in JPEG file (or paired RAW+JPEG if that's the case).  This JPEG is created by the camera itself and shouldn't have discoloration issues.  You can probably try the second step right now and see if you get the right results; either way, I recommend upgrading if at all possible.\nNOTE: I didn't notice until I posted the above that you're using the Shotwell Photo Viewer (i.e. you're double-clicking on the RAW file in Nautilus).  The Camera Developer is only available in Shotwell's library mode, that is, you run Shotwell and import the photos into your library.\n", "Q: What alternatives to MS Access exist for database management on the Ubuntu platform (LibreOffice Base isn't cutting it) I have a web-based MySQL database, which is very important. I have used the MySQL Connector to allow me to use an MS Access database to query, and clean up my database, through an ODBC connection. \nHaving moved my work computer to Ubuntu Linux (finally) I was trying to avoid using a VirtualBox VM to host a Windows installation to continue using MS Access, since there are so many tools available for the Linux Platform.\nYesterday, I installed the MySQL Connector for LibreOffice from the Ubuntu Software Center, and planned to move forward with LibreOffice, just like I did with MS Access - but LibreOffice Base doesn't have any ability to do update queries (unless you are writing our SQL query by hand) - and it's still kinda clunky... IMHO.\nWhat other database management tools exist for a Ubuntu desktop, so I can query, update, and report my web-based MySQL database, (and can completely avoid Windows and MS Access, going forward)?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: I used MS Access a lot when working. Since retiring I looked for something like Access but did not find anything. Just for info what I have done.\nSo I decided to learn python. But the learning curve seems pretty steep, maybe oldfred is not so young anymore. But it did not become just learning python, but learning a python editor - geany, learning first gtk and its editor and then I switched to qt4 and its editor-qt4 designer and a separate sql editor -sqliteman to create or test sql code. I am using sqlite, but the connector code is just a little different.\nSo MS Access is an integrated enviroment and works together. Just about everything else is not. You have to choose a language, a database, a gui, and a sql editor. And there is no report writer, but you can manually create pdf or HTML code for reports. I just export csv files and import to a spreadsheet as that is an easier way to create sub-totals and grand totals.\nIf a hobby like I am you can experiment, but if this is a business I cannot really recommend trying to roll your own MS Access. \nThe navicat suggestion looks interesting, but have not tried that. If I was still working I might spend the money to try it. Maybe someone has more info?\n\nA: The following link is a company to that provides a cross platform database management tool.\nIt is not free but you can try it free for 30 days with no restrictions.\nAll info such as prices etc are listed on the site.\nhttp://www.navicat.com/products/navicat-for-mysql\nPS: I have no connection to this company and have never even used their software; just trying to provide some info.\nBest of luck.\n", "Q: DHCP server installation error Ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to install DHCP server using command \"sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server\".

I have read several tutorials out there and once dabbled with Linux distributions years ago before there really was any tutorials, guides, etc. to help me.\nSo anyway, I have a machine with two hard disk drives. Both are 698 GB drives. The first one has Windows 7 on it and the partitions on it for recovery, HP tools, etc. It has four partitions on it already, but I wanted to install Ubuntu on the second hard disk drive anyway. The second hard drive has nothing at all on it. I never kept any data or anything on it. So when I run the Ubuntu installation off of my USB drive and select to set up my partitions for the installation myself (rather than letting it overwrite or install side by side) it only shows sdc which is the drive I wanted to install on.\nI did not expect to see the other drive because it has four primary partitions on it already anyhow. The problem (or may not be I'm just concerned) is that it says sdc has 750 GB. However, that drive is only 698 GB maximum. It did say that sdc has 14 GB already used which is what Windows and GParted show me too. It did say it would unmount it during installation. So I'm pretty sure it's the correct drive, but I'm confused about the 750 GB.\nI do not want the installation to accidentally start messing with my Windows 7 installation and files on the other hard drive. Another source of confusion is when I'm looking with GParted. I expected the first hard drive with the Windows 7 installation to show sda1, sda2, etc. for the installation, data, HP tools, recovery, etc. like tutorials on-line show me it should do.

For an example of what I mean see this post: http://gparted-forum.surf4.info/viewtopic.php?pid=25907#p25907\nEDIT: I've now discovered the following information:\n\n\n*\n\n*The exact sector at which the copy operation was interrupted is no. 2,529,216,511.\n\n*According to the disk's MBR the partition's first sector is 202,390 MiB from the start of the disk and has a length of 1,705,337 MiB - which is what I was supposed to end up with.\n\n*The extended BPB in the NTFS partition claims the size of the partition is 1,293,319 MiB. This is wrong and presumably should have been updated when the copying completed.\n\n\nA: OK, so I finally fixed this!\nThis solution should also work for other filesystems if GParted does the same 'direct copy'. Obviously you'll need to use something other than chkdsk at the end.\nAnyway, here's the procedure for solving the problem for the benefit of anyone who's as unlucky/stupid* as me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before you start, relax - go get yourself some coffee or a mug of hot chocolate!\nYour data is still on the disk, you just need to look for it. Spending time calmly checking things over won't harm you. Rushing and being impulsive might.\n\n*Read this through thoroughly and make sure you understand each step. If you then decide to follow these instructions it's probably a good idea to make a backup on a separate disk using dd. It's easy to make mistakes and a backup would give you a safety net.\n\n*Make sure you make a note of any information about the last thing GParted was doing. You'll want to know how far the copy operation got (as precise as possible) and how far backwards/forwards it was copying things.\n\n*Work out the exact location where the copy finished. I've written two Python scripts to help with this but they've only been tested on ubuntu (definitely won't work in Windows) and need modification for your specific case.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly use this to find a single matching sector on the disk: findDuplicateSector.py\n\n*Then use this to find the last matching sector (i.e. where the operation was interrupted): findCopyInterruptLocation.py\n\n*Read the code and make sure you understand it. I've tested it briefly but there may be bugs. All numbers given are absolute offsets from the start of the partition/file, i.e. offset 0 is the first sector in the partition and offset n is the n+1th sector.\n\n\n*Use dd or something similar to complete the copy operation, taking care not to get the input and output offsets confused. Here's the syntax for dd:\nsudo dd bs=512 skip=<input_offset> if=<partition> seek=<output_offset> of=<partition> count=<num_sectors_to_copy>\n\nThis step will take a long time (it took me 8 hours). If you want to see how its progressing, run this in a separate terminal and dd will give you an update on its progress in its own terminal window:\nsudo kill -s USR1 <PID_of_dd>\n\n\n*Check the following and correct if necessary:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Master Boot Record (MBR)'s partition table entries should match what you told GParted to do (see the wikipedia article, it's very informative). Specifically check the value for the LBA of the first sector of the partition and its total number of sectors.\n\n*The Partition Boot Record of the partition you're modifying should match MBR (in my case it didn't). For NTFS the total partition size in sectors should be at offset 40 from the start of the partition. I don't think NTFS records what the offset of the partition relative to the start of the disk is though.\n\n\n*Run chkdsk in read-only mode, i.e. with no command line arguments other than the drive name to check that it can find all the files in the partition. If it fails to verify the file indexes then DO NOT continue. Don't worry if it complains about the $Bitmap file containing errors.\n\n*If, and only if step 5 succeeded, run chkdsk /f to fix for example the $Bitmap file. If you run this while file indexes are still wrong it may end up deleting them, making things much more difficult for you.\n\n*You might want to run chkdsk in read-only mode again to make sure it worked, just for peace of mind.\n*Actually I'm too arrogant - we're not stupid. But seriously - make backups!\n\nA: After a GParted Forum user reported the same issue of a GParted failed\nresize/move, I wrote find-overlap.py.

[update and update II: see my awkward and proper solutions at the end of the question, based on one of the answers]\nI have an extremely slow DNS lookup when my resolv.conf file includes the 127.0.0.1 IP address, actually, many names do not get resolved at all as it (most certainly) times out.\nI found one question with what looks like a valid answer here:\nExtremely slow DNS lookup\nexcept that I can see the the dnsmasq tool is running for the IP range 192.168.122.2 to 192.168.122.254. This looks like the IPs used by VirtualBox and qemu, so I would imagine that if I turn off dnsmasq, accessing the Internet from a virtual system will fail!\nWould there be another reason for the slowness and/or timeout? (note that the problem is more prominent with specific systems such as the user pictures on all stackoverflow websites, including askubuntu, when the problem occurs.)\nAt this point I remove the IP from the resolv.conf file and that bypasses the issue while I'm browsing, but I don't think that's the best solution (and of course that IP is reinstalled there on each reboot!) I'd like a more permanent solution to this problem that still allows me to run the virtual systems as expected.\nP.S.

The bug referenced by the resolvconf author below, found here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bind9/+bug/933723\nclearly states that if you want to use bind9, you WILL get the namespace 127.0.0.1 in your resolv.conf file. No choice. (RESOLVCONF=no does not seem to do anything, although I may have a surprise after a reboot which I will do very soon!)\nAs a side note: If I point the /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail softlink to /dev/null (as mentioned below) then I get a resolv.conf that looks like this:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\nIn other words, I still get the 127.0.0.1 which is the culprit at this point. But also I completely lose the other two nameservers, even though they are clearly specified in my eth1 interface. This being said, looking in the /run/resolvconf/interface/ directory, I see an eth1.net and lo.named files. The lo.named is copied to the resolv.conf, but not the eth1.net. I have no clue how those files get created and then copied to resolv.conf but that is the dynamism used by resolvconf...\nAnyway, there are two solutions mentioned in the bug:\n(1) Delete the /etc/resolv.conf soft link and replace it with a plain file with exactly what you want. This may work for you, but I thought that keeping the default dynamic file would be best.\n(2) Change your bind9 settings so BIND can respond to those local DNS requests. The interesting thing with that is that names will now be cached on your computer. So it is not all bad. This being said, I was not too interested in opening my nameserver to all domain names... But this works and I do not have to destroy the dynamic resolv.conf.\nJust in case, here is an example setup for the bind to make that work:\noptions {\n    [...]\n    forwarders {\n          // Google DNSes\n          8.8.8.8;\n          8.8.4.4;\n    };\n    [...]\n};\n\n\nUpdate II:\nOkay! The reboot got rid of the lo.named file in the /run/resolvconf/interface directory. That must be because bind knows to create it if RESOLVCONF=yes, but it does not delete it if RESOLVCONF=no. However, a reboot takes care of that because the /run directory is a RAM disk.\nWithout that file in the way, the /etc/resolv.conf is setup with exactly what I'd expect which is the list of nameservers as defined in my eth1 definition found in /etc/network/interface as shown earlier.\nSo... it's a big mess because there are many factors and in some cases a reboot is required!\n\nA: 1: Add dns-nameservers and dns-search options to /etc/network/interfaces.\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n    address 162.226.130.121\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 162.226.130.126\n    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 162.226.130.126\n    dns-search m2osw.com\n\n2: Remove all dns- options from files in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/. That resolv.conf includes nameserver options after nameserver 127.0.0.1 indicates that such cruft is present. If /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail is a symbolic link, make it a symbolic link to /dev/null.\n3: Downup eth1.\nsudo ifdown eth1\nsudo ifup eth1\n\n4: Look in /etc/resolv.conf. Is nameserver 127.0.0.1 still there and are replies to DNS queries still delayed?  If so then figure out where the nameserver 127.0.0.1 line is coming from. Something is registering the listen address 127.0.0.1 without starting a local nameserver at 127.0.0.1. (i) One possibility is the bind9 package. If you aren't running a local BIND nameserver then purge the bind9 package (sudo apt-get purge bind9). If you are running a BIND nameserver that doesn't provide general Internet name service then edit /etc/default/bind9 and set RESOLVCONF=no, then restart the nameserver. See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bind9/+bug/933723 (ii) Another possibility is that you have remnants of dnsmasq or similar package on the system. Purge that package. Also purge network-manager since you aren't using it. \n5: Reboot and see if things have improved, then report back here.\n\nA: Using a dns server with a loopback address (e.g. 127.0.0.1) causes problems: \nAll other dns server with a lower priority are ignored by resolvconf. \nThe priority of dns servers is defined by the network interfaces with which the dns-server is defined. \nSee /etc/resolvconf/interface-order and man 5 interface-order. \nLuckily there is an environment variable to change this behaviour: \nTRUNCATE_NAMESERVER_LIST_AFTER_LOOPBACK_ADDRESS\n\nSee man 8 resolvconf\nIf put \nTRUNCATE_NAMESERVER_LIST_AFTER_LOOPBACK_ADDRESS=no\n\nin /etc/default/resolvconf and restart the resolvconf service all other dns server will show up in /etc/resolv.conf. \n\nA: If you polulate /etc/network/interfaces with a static IP declaration, you then are also responsible for declaring DNS nameserver addresses. I suggest:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 162.226.130.121\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 162.226.130.126 #Isn't the gateway actually xx.1??\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 162.226.130.126 #or any others you prefer.\n\nI think you can then leave resolv.conf alone to be rewritten by the system as needed.\n", "Q: Can't boot Ubuntu after installation I just installed Ubuntu on my laptop which currently has Windows 7 installed on it as well.

You wouldn't even be able to inspect  the dependencies by extracting the deb, because they are downloaded and installed at install time. It's an approach that completely bypass the repositories system. No concerned user would be happy with a package that, behind the scenes (and as root, remember!), downloads additional untrusted software from untrusted sources. Yes, that would require fiddling with DEBIAN/postinst (or preinst) and issuing a wget (or, in your case, pip install), and that is the approach taken by Flash, Oracle Java, Steam and others. But that is proprietary, closed source software, so their security is none anyway.\nSolution #1.5:\nYou didn't mention it, but you could integrate the dependencies only at build time, ie, in the source package (the .orig.tar.gz, .debian.tar.gz, .dsc triad), by downloading from PyPi when creating the \"binary\" package (the .deb). The instructions for the pip install would go into debian/rules (notice the lowercase debian, as opposed to the binary package), and would be executed when you issue debuild or dpkg-buildpackage.\nThis is a middle-ground between #1 and #3. It mitigates (but not solve!) some of the issues of #3: at least you can inspect the final product, and the .deb would not require internet access at install time. All the risks and burdens are transferred from final user to the package maintainer. But, has the same problems as #1, as it bypasses most of the packaging system infrastructure. Afterall, handling dependencies (versions, updates, requirements, conflicts) is why dpkg/aptwas created in the first place! :)\nSolution #2:\nThe One True Right Way™. You create debian packages for your dependencies, list them as requirements in your package, and ship all the .debs or source packages.\nFrom there, you have a number of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Submit the source packages, both your software and its dependencies, for inclusion to Debian. If accepted, they would be automatically available to all Debian users, including all derivatives like Ubuntu.\n\n*Upload the source packages to Launchpad, thus creating a PPA that any Ubuntu user (and its derivatives like Linux Mint) could easily add and install\n\n*Host your own debian repository in your website, that users from any Debian-based system could add to their /etc/apt/sources.list.d and use the apt infrastructure to download, install and keep updated, (like the above!)\n\n*Host the .deb files for direct download and install. No apt or automatic updates involved thought.\nAs for how to package your PyPi dependencies (and your python software too!), there are a number of tools and references that make the process easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*stdeb, as you mentioned. Oldie and goodie.\n\n*Pybuild, a new, amazing tool from Debian that supersedes stdeb.\nAnd many useful references:\n\n\n*\n\n*Style Guide for Packaging Python Libraries\n\n*Debian Python Policy \nNeed help? Check those out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian Mentors FAQ\n\n*Python Packaging Team\n\nA: I think you just need to add the relevant command line code to the postinst script in the .deb package.

I'm still a newbie, but I wrote a program in Visual Studio Express 2012 on Windows with references to an API through a .dll and .NET framework 4.0. If I try it on Ubuntu, I get messages like \"Could Not Load File Or Assembly\". Is there a way to run this on Ubuntu? If so, how do I get it to work?\n\nA: Ok I figured it out. You can't simply compile your .net code under Windows and then expect it to run under linux like this:\nmono myprog.exe\nYou have to compile it under Linux first - so first download the vb compiler\napt-get install mono-vbnc\nthen copy your source code over and compile like this\nvbnc myprog.vb\nthen run like this:\nmono myprog.exe\nHope this helps someone!\n\nA: Some VB.net applications will run on ubuntu using mono. In general support for them is not as good as for c#.\nYou can run your application from the commandline as follows:\nmono YourAssembly.exe\n\n\nA: Yes you can do that simply installing mono on your ubuntu as follows\nsudo apt-get install mono-complete\n\nAfter installation of mono \nmono test.exe\n\nIf you want to browse more about mono visit: http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page\n", "Q: Eclipse only starts with sudo command from terminal I have to start by saying that I have just switched to Ubuntu from Windows and I am new to Linux in general. Coming from Windows, I really am not familiar with how exactly the permissions work, the Linux file system, where I am able to create folders that I can use without the sudo command etc.\nI use eclipse on a daily basis for android development and other simple java swing projects. I was able to download and extract the latest available version of eclipse (kepler) to this path: /opt/eclipse. Inside this directory is the eclipse executable and other eclipse related files. \nI also installed the JDK and verified with the java -version command. It says:\njava version \"1.7.0_25\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_25-b15)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.25-b01, mixed mode)\n\nI am running on a 64 bit CPU architecture so both programs are the 64 bit version.\nNow, my problem is that if I open eclipse from the Unity dash or from the file explorer, it give me this error: \n\nHowever if I run sudo eclipse in the terminal, everything runs just fine as long as I do it as the super user. I have a hunch that the JDK is installed in a folder that is restricted to normal users and only works if I run the sudo command but this is just a hunch. As I said, I am new to Linux and I am not really sure what I am doing wrong here, I am learning as I go. I need a good explanation as to how to make it start from the Unity dock without the sudo command. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Well after running the which java cmd, I noticed that the path to the JDK from the eclipse.ini file was not pointing to the correct location. I fixed the path and now it works. I don't know how the sudo  cmd overrides the eclipse.ini path to JDK but well, it works\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu 12.04 as windows application I am  currently trying to use Ubuntu without leaving windows. I have downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. \nI ran wubi to install it as a windows application but it required the installation of an image of the operating system from the internet and displayed an error message \"couldn't retrieve system image\" or something like that. \nMy question is why it need to connect to the internet. I used ubuntu 11.10 and did the same with no problem.\nWhy it needs to download files from the internet although the file size 695 MB, and contain the windows installer file wubi.exe.\n\nA: Copy both wubi.exe and the dexktop.iso to the same folder on your windows system and launch wubi from there\nSource: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_do_I_install_Wubi_on_a_machine_with_no_Internet_connection.3F\n", "Q: Springseed won't run? Installed Springseed here (http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/07/springseed-note-taking-app-for-ubuntu) : Note taking app on Ubuntu 12.04 lts i386, just wont work. it pretty much installed correctly, downloaded the .deb from the website here (http://getspringseed.com/) and installed it via software center. The thing just won't start ? On clicking the icon post- installation, blah, NO GUI, nothing shows up et all !? Is it with me only ? Uninstalled the app, downloaded again and ran it, No success. Care to comment ? ! Thanks. \n\nA: To start the program, you can just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\n/opt/springseed/springseed-bin\n\nOr you can create a shortcut on the desktop to start the application from.

So I checked my /var directory and it wasn't there. I saw evidence that it could be in a different folder so I used locate /*/www but the output was bashie@tinylinbook:/srv$ locate /*/www\nbashie@tinylinbook:/srv$ ; nothing. Do I need this directory or will SFTP sort itself out? I would really appreciate help.\n\nA: /var/www/ has nothing to do with shhd, it's for web servers.\nYou can install Apache or nginx if you want a httpd, but as I say, it's completely unnecessary for ssh and sftp.\nThe guide you're following is geared at giving each user their own website and limiting them to it.\n\nA: If you want to give access to user's web directory you need a web root directory. Do you have apache or another web server install on your system? If so, check is configuration and change /var/www in your sftp configuration for the web root server path.

So I have my music collection living on my 12.04.2 server. This Collection has traveled with me over the years from a Windows machine to a MacBook Pro, and then finally to where it is today on the server.\nI have noticed that for some reason all of my 'folder.jpg' (cover photos) are highlighted green on the terminal (signaling that they are executable). if I run chmod -x folder.jpg the terminal will then show them in a light purple (signaling some form of media file). Now i'm not worried about the color, per se, but I have two questions. a) Why are my .jpgs being given the executable bit? (Probably from Windows screwing with them, i'm sure), and b) how can I recursively run chmod -x *.jpg from the top of my music hierarchy? \nWhen I try chmod -R -x *.jpg from the top level, I get:\nmediausr@MediaSRV:/space/music$ chmod -R -x *.jpg\nchmod: cannot access `*.jpg': No such file or directory\n\nBonus Question: All of the folders are colored for 'other writable', while new folders I create are colored correctly for 'directory'. I'm not super worried about this at all, as it does not involve things being executable, but you know, if someone could enlighten me on a recursive way of making the system see them as straight up directories, that would be awesome. :0)\nThanks for all of your input.\n\nA: There is no (good) reason ever for pictures to be executable.\nJust run this command to fix them:\nfind /space/music -name \"*.jpg\" -exec chmod -x {} +\n\nBonus:\nfind /space/music -type d -exec chmod o-w {} +\n\nExplanation:\nMost of the command line is self-explanatory. The only part that need some insight is the ending. {} is replaced by the name of the files (resp directory) found that match the filter. Usually, the find command is ended with a protected semicolon \\;.\nHowever, this isn't efficient as the command is run once for each file/directory.\nThere is a well known workaround that pipes find output to xargs which concatenates the file names up to the maximum command line allowed but then there is an issue when the path contains spaces, which is more and more common even in the Unix/Linux world.\nAgain a workaround based on GNU specific extensions allows to properly handle these case. I choose a simpler approach using a POSIX (read portable) way to have find building itself the long command lines, i.e. {} is replaced by a suite of file names up to the maximum number allowed.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu with SSD and HDD So I have an Acer laptop that has both an HDD and SSD. I have been having trouble dual booting Ubuntu with Windows. For some reason Ubuntu does not recognize Windows and I do not want to wipe out windows hard drive...

I was wondering if it was okay to keep windows on my hdd and just install ubuntu on my ssd(20 GB)?\nOr in anyone has an alternate solution I am all ears..

Just make sure to install the grub to the 1st disk in the boot order.\n\n\nA: Since both the operating systems are on different hard drives, I think the BIOS will always check 1 disk before the other. And whichever OS it sees on that disk, it will boot into. One option to pick the OS at boot-up is to switch the boot-order when you boot. There is usually a small time-frame during boot-up in which you can press a key,for example, F11, but may be different, to enter boot options This should be displayed when you boot your machine.\nboot...\n", "Q: Will the Ubuntu Edge work with 800MHz CDMA networks in India I am based in india using Reliance, CDMA\nFor CDMA in India, the frequencies are: \n824 - 844 MHz for the uplink (handset to base station) \n869 - 889 MHz for the downlink (base station to handset) \n20 MHz band for uplink & downlink.\ncarrier freq. is 1.25MHz\nsince i am interested in purchasing the phone, and the phone does not come cheap , can you guys confirm that it will work in india.\nThanks\nNitin\n\nA: No. It's a GSM/3G/LTE-based device.\n", "Q: cannot access copied folder in htdocs of lampp in ubuntu?

That would simplify booting into Ubuntu, as you can select the Grub2 option when you \n(re)boot. Please note, EasyBCD will give you multiple Grub options to choose from. You want Grub2, not any other Grub option EasyBCD will offer.\nIf you don't mind using BOOTMGR (the Windows Vista/Seven/Eight boot screen) to select which OS you load, that's all you need to do.\nHowever, if you prefer to start with Grub, you could mount the Windows partition into Ubuntu, run sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda, and finally sudo update-grub. You should probably replace the /dev/sda part of the command line with whatever drive Ubuntu is installed on. Please note that there is no number (1,2,3,4,5...) in sda. This is intentional, as (I believe) it's telling the system which hard drive to install Grub ontu, not the partition.\nFrom there, you can reboot into Windows and remove the Grub2 option from the Windows screen, if you so desire.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 on two drives I'm trying to boot Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 8 on my aspire S7.

How does Super+D work to show the desktop?\nDoes it minimize all windows?\nOr does it set the desktop as \"on top\"?\nOr does it make all windows invisible?  \nCan I exclude certain windows/applications from \"show desktop\"?\n\nA: Where do you see a \"show desktop\" option?\nThere is no invisible windows unless an application creates such. It will minimize the windows. It may be possible to avoid that action if your window does not allow for minimization.\nAlso the desktop cannot be \"on top\" because it is the parent window of all the windows created by applications. In other words, those windows are inside the desktop window anyway. Actually, some X11 desktop implementations show large icons in the desktop window when a (child) window is minimized.\n", "Q: How to emulate XInput device with DirectInput gamepad? I'm trying to get a Logitech Dual Action controller to work with Bastion, on Ubuntu 13.04. From what I've gathered, Bastion is only compatible with XInput devices, and my controller only supports DirectInput. In fact, the game will recognize most of the buttons except for button 7 (left trigger) and button 10 (the 'start' button on a console gamepad).\nIs it possible to somehow emulate an XInput device, like the xbox 360 controller?\n\nA: Answered here by Reddit user theliphantGen:\n\nAs I spent quite some time to figure it out I just wanted to note this somewhere.\nLong story short - I couldn't make Brutal Legend or Shank to recognize any of my gamepads. Today I found out that xboxdrv can work on top of ANY joystick/gamepad using evdev. So with this simple mapping I have xboxdrv create another gamepad which mimics xbox360 controller using xpad driver and works out-of-the-box in both Shank and Brutal Legend (and should with others too):\nxboxdrv --evdev /dev/input/event15 --evdev-absmap ABS_X=x1,ABS_Y=y1,ABS_RZ=x2,ABS_Z=y2,ABS_HAT0X=dpad_x,ABS_HAT0Y=dpad_y --axismap -Y1=Y1,-Y2=Y2 --evdev-keymap BTN_TOP=x,BTN_TRIGGER=y,BTN_THUMB2=a,BTN_THUMB=b,BTN_BASE3=back,BTN_BASE4=start,BTN_BASE=lb,BTN_BASE2=rb,BTN_TOP2=lt,BTN_PINKIE=rt,BTN_BASE5=tl,BTN_BASE6=tr --mimic-xpad --silent\n\n/dev/input/event15 should point to correct event device of your gamepad. This is the mapping for PS2 controller adapter. You can adjust it by removing --silent and adding --evdev-debug to output evdev codes for pressed buttons/axes\n\n", "Q: Unable to find hadoop-env.sh in hadoop folder I am trying to install hadoop on Ubuntu 12.04.

Now my PC simply boots into Windows 8.\nIf I press 'Esc' at start of BIOS, and then F9,the GRUB shows up and Ubuntu is listed at the top of the several options to boot from.\nI did run Boot-Repair once I logged into Ubuntu explicitly from GRUB as mentioned above. I did all said by Stormvirux in this link, but was still unsuccessful.\nThe debug info is listed here.\nSomething which confuses me is the message which Boot-Repair stated after it did its job.\n\nYou can now reboot your computer.\n  Please do not forget to make your BIOS boot on sda (8004MB) disk!\n  The boot files of [The OS now in use - Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS] are far from the start of the disk.

Your system did promote the flash drive to sda and made your 1TB drive sdb, but it still should boot ok.\nYou must be booting Boot-Repair in BIOS mode if a grub reinstall is asking for a bios_grub partition.

But you really want to boot in UEFI mode.\nI have not seen boot issue on any UEFI based system with grub or kernel files far into hard drive. But some BIOS based systems would not boot if kernel or grub were beyond 100GB on drive. Those needed a separate /boot nearer start of drive. \nFrom UEFI menu, can you boot Ubuntu with secure boot on or with it off?

I don't know if the driver was updated while installing Ubuntu or if it can. All advice are greatly appreciated.\nGuna   \n\nA: According to the Ubuntu Documentation Radeon Driver wiki, you are already using the correct graphics driver for your system, that is the free, open source driver for many ATI graphics cards that comes preinstalled with the Ubuntu default installation. Your graphics card is on the Ubuntu Documentation Radeon Driver wiki's list of Radeon graphics cards that have good 3D acceleration support.\nSo before you consider trying to install a graphics driver that is not recommended for your system, you should check to see if it is possible for you to change your screen resolution using an application called Resolution Switcher from the Ubuntu Software Center.

I have an asus laptop, windows 8 is the current OS. I am trying to install ubuntu as a dual boot, so far I have tried downloading it from the ubuntu website however a message error showed when I tried to reboot and now can't replicate this message, it said the file contained some sort of error. Next I tried to boot from USB, I don't have a cd drive so CD isn't an option. No luck with the USB it didn't recognize the files. Is there a possibility that my laptop isn't compatible with Ubuntu?\nThanks.\n\nA: The best thing to do is to visit Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI the answer is one which will take you through what you need to do to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.\n\nA: Did you download an ISO image of Ubuntu? You need to write it as a bootable image to the USB drive (you can't just copy the iso file onto the USB). Something like unetbootin will do it.\nYou may also need to change boot settings to boot from the USB drive (as @M.Tarun suggested). During boot, press Delete (or sometimes F2, sometimes other keys) to get into the BIOS. You should be able to select the USB drive as the boot device.\nYou may also need to turn off SecureBoot in the BIOS -- I'm not sure what the current status is of that, although I've heard Ubuntu were looking at getting their installers signed so it could be installed with SecureBoot turned on.\n", "Q: Any 3D CAD programs for Ubuntu? I need a good CAD program for mechanical engineering.\nAre there any good 3D CAD programs available for Ubuntu like Autocad?  \n\nA: OpenSCAD\n\nOpenSCAD is a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. It is free\n  software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. Unlike\n  most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does\n  not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the\n  CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when\n  you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure\n  is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in\n  creating computer-animated movies.\n\nTo install OpenSCAD, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:openscad/releases\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install openscad\n\nFor more CAD apps see 8 Best CAD Apps for Linux\n\nA: For 3D use Blender. I think it is the only real alternative. BUT you will have to do a lot of work, because it is focused on animation. Blender is extremely wide, you will have to find what you need, what is not always easy for beginners. For example, there are plugin tools to improve exact 3D modelling, you might customize views etc.\nFor 2D use DraftSight (not free software). It is a clon of AutoCAD, which means that you don't have to get familiar with new commands, workflow etc. For individuals it is free, Information about your behavior will be send regularly to DraftSight. Go to their Homepage and get the actual .deb file. DraftSight's disadvantage is, that there is no 3D.\n\nA: BRL-CAD\nMaybe BRL-CAD would suit:\n\nBRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform Open Source combinatorial Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling system that includes interactive 3D solid geometry editing, high-performance ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis, network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing tools, path-tracing and photon mapping support for realistic image synthesis, a system performance analysis benchmark suite, an embedded scripting interface, and libraries for robust high-performance geometric representation and analysis.\n\n\nA: FreeCAD\nIf you haven't tried FreeCAD, you're missing out.  It's a fully parametric 3-D modelling package that can be extended with Python. The interface is reasonably user-friendly, and feels like a \"younger\" version of Solidworks.\nInstallation: Just install freecad package , or newer version using PPA. Also you have an AppImage.\n\nA: There is no free 3D solid modelling CAD software worth using.\nFreeCAD is the only one coming close, but \"close\" in a relative sense... It does not do fillets well, boolean operators do not work, you can't even create sketch planes!\nSo unless you want trivially simple, blocky models for free then you are out of luck.\n\nA: Sometimes you have to pay for real software. Varicad is a very good linux compatible system and the price is very decent indeed. I have tested it against Solidworks and it performs just fine. It does not have built in FEA but there are many such programs for Linux. Try the free trial and see.\n\nA: EQUINOX-3D has advanced freeform and numeric CAD, photorealistic / physically based rendering, animation, and tons of other features.\nWe use it heavily and exclusively for advanced CAD modeling / 3D printing very complex, organic shapes, like robot parts.\nHere's the list of the latest features, movies, etc.\nAll images and movies on the Web site were a 100% created with EQUINOX-3D\n\nA: Try Nanocad with the Wine emulator. Nanocad is the most similar software to Autocad I have found; I haven't tried it with Ubuntu but you can take a look at Wine's page for more information on how to run the Windows version on Linux.\n\nA: You must be looking for something like M4 suite (proprietary software). I don't know how good it is, never used it, but it's the only specialized CAD I found in Linux.\n\nA: use SIEMENS PLM NX. Although its not free and there is no ubuntu inbuilt support but u can use it via adding some libraries and applying some modifications to your os as it is supported in redhat and suse linux\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working properly on ubuntu When I turn on my bluetooth in ubuntu 12.04 it does not show any options for discovering devices or any bluetooth functions.\nWhat should I do to show these options?\nAs you can see even though bluetooth is turn on(in status bar) no options are shown.\n\nA: Run the Following command in the terminal..\nsudo hciconfig hci0 reset\n\nIt should than turn ON the bluetooth.\nIf you are using laptop than try to turn it OFF and ON,using hardware switch.

I looked around on Google to find out a solution and found Cadoc's thread How do I resolve a GRUB: “invalid arch independent ELF magic” error? and followed the solution up to the line\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nWhen I typed that command, I got\n/usr/sbin/grub-bios-setup: Not found.\n\nand I couldn't find any solution for that after some searching on Google. So what do I have to do to fix that and get thing going fine?\n\nA: If `grub-bios-setup' is not found, you probably have a EFI mode installation of Ubuntu.\n[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo \"Installed in EFI mode\" || echo \"Installed in Legacy mode\" \n\nIf this is not the case, something went really bad during installation. You can try using boot-repair to fix your problem.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n\nA: Looks like a bad grub install.

After compressing this file using gzip, the file size was around 110MB.\nRunning the df -h command, the root partition's disk usage is still at 100%. I'm assuming a reboot will correct this, but since it's a production server, I was wondering if there was a way to convince this server that it actually has much more free space than it thinks.\nThanks in advance for the help and advice.\nEDIT: Lesson learned: lsof is your friend!\nAfter running lsof and grepping for auth.log, I was able to determine that another process was using auth.log. After restarting that process, the free space was recognized by the server.\n\nA: To figure this out, I ran sudo lsof | grep auth.log. This gave me a list of services that were using the auth.log file.\nRsyslog was one that I had already figured would have auth.log open, so I had already restarted it. What I forgot to take into account was the fact that we use OSSEC, and it had auth.log open as well. Restarting OSSEC solved the problem; the free space was then recognized by the server.\n", "Q: text document shows random characters I had a text document notepad file in my windows7 with some text written in it then I wrote some more text in ubuntu in that file but now it seems that I have lost all the texts since it shows random characters mostly like /00/00/00/ do you have any idea how I can recover my information again?tnx\n\nA: You see random characters when trying to read the text document back in Microsoft's Notepad, right?\nDid you trying reading it back from Ubuntu? (if this works, then it's probably Notepad's fault) If you can't check from Ubuntu, try installing Notepad++ in Windows, and reading your text document with it.\nAs a general rule, I would recommend avoiding Microsoft's Notepad in Windows, and using a more serious alternative, Notepad2 or Notepad++ for instance. (Notepad2 is easier to get into, but replaces Microsoft's Notepad in Windows' menus) It will save you from a lot of pain when being in non Windows-only environments.\n", "Q: How do I install Windows 8 alongside Ubuntu 12.04 I have seen a many questions about installing Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 8.

Every time I see how to install both, it is assumed windows 8 is installed first.\nThank You\n\nA: The best way to go about this is to go to the following page Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI and see the comprehensive answer given there.\n\nA: Use gparted (or other) to make room for Windows. Install Windows 8 onto the new partition.  \nThen boot from a live copy of ubuntu,\nonce in ubuntu from terminal run \nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThis should restore your grub boot loader.\n\nA: Is your system UEFI (and BIOS) or just BIOS. You have to be sure to install both systems in the same boot mode and how you partition also makes a difference.\nIf you only have BIOS or just want BIOS you must use MBR(msdos) partitioning not gpt. Ubuntu can use either gpt partitioning with UEFI or BIOS, but Windows only boots from gpt partitioned drives with UEFI.\nThen you can just leave space or create a sda1, formatted NTFS with the boot flag for your install of Windows later. You may want to also have another NTFS partition for shared data which can be a logical partition. Windows only boots from primary partitions with BIOS and MBR(msdos) partitioning.\nIf you have and want UEFI Windows has additional partition requirements which you really should create in advance.\nWindows Recommended UEFI-Based Disk-Partition Configurations\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744301%28WS.10%29.aspx\nBoth Windows & Ubuntu will use the same efi partition which should be the first partition on the drive.\n", "Q: Getting a deb with wget problem I'm trying to get Anki like this:\nwget https://anki.googlecode.com/files/anki-2.0.12.deb\n\n(That's the latest version) gives me:\nzsh: no such file or directory: wget https://anki.googlecode.com/files/anki-2.0.12.deb\n\nI'm writing an install script for my system, the same worked with Skype and GoogleChrome, not sure what's the problem?\n\nA: There is no problem with the script or the command.

I partitioned the HDD as follows (it's a 1TB drive):\n/home  -  (the rest)- ext2, \n/     -   20GB   -    ext2, \n/boot  -  100MB   -   ext2, \n/swap  -  8GB\n/EFIboot - 40MB\n\nThe only difference when I tried this method was that I got THIS message:\n\"Failed to create Swap space\n\nThe creation of swap space in partition #2 of SCSI5 (0,0,0)(sda) failed.\"\n\nBasically, the only difference was that there was now a '2' instead of a '3'. If I may ask, what exactly am I doing wrong? I've tried looking around the internet (that's basically all I've done for the last two days), but no one seems to have the same problem that I have, and I've tried most of the solutions for similar problems (DBAN, formatting partitions in ext2 format, etc).\nThe only thing I haven't tried is using the terminal to manually partition the HDD...and I actually DID try to do this, but I wasn't able to get past 'su' 's password demand, so I wasn't able to use the terminal.\nThank you for your help in advance.\n~Welsh\nUPDATE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAlrighty, I just went and did a little more testing, and here's what I found (thanks to your advice, Cuban...and user, I made the appropriate modifications to my data portions):\nWhen I tried using the manual installer again, this time I only created /boot, /(root), and /home partitions. When the EFI window popped up, I continued, and when the \"You don't have swap\" window popped up, I continued. Just like before, after about two seconds a window popped up, but it had a different error this time:\n\"Failed to create a file system\n\nThe ext4 file system creation in partition #1 of SCSI5 (0,0,0)(sda) failed.\"\n\nAt this point, I'm pretty sure the installer is just not going to work. Partition #1, in this case, was the /boot partition.\nAfter I did that, I went and learned how to use fdisk, and succeeded in creating an 8GB Linux swap/Solaris partition in slot #1 (was that the correct way to create swap? It was Hexcode 82). At any rate, do you know what the file types are for /home, /(root), and /boot? If so, I can probably just completely format the HD before running the installer, since it's not doing so well at the partitioning part. Once I get it formatted manually, would I just go into the 'Manual Installation' part of the installer and 'Continue' without creating any partitions?\nEDIT: Actually, I just went back into sudo fdisk /dev/sda, and then typed 'p'...and I saw a blank table of partitions, with no sign of the partition I had just created. Is that supposed to happen?\nThanks again for your help. Thanks to you I'm finally starting to enjoy Linux (even though I haven't even actually installed it yet).\n~Welsh\nUPDATE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI looked through a few other tutorials, and tried running and using GParted to partition my HDD. Well, when I went under 'Device' and 'Created a new Table', I got an error in the console: /dev/sda: unrecognised disk label. Maybe my HDD just can't be partitioned?\n\nA: I would change the disk label, or create one if you don't have one. I think that is your root problem. You are either using a label that is reserved, or have some crazy random characters in it, or have none at all. Put something like 'Your-name-home' or 'your-name-laptop'. Be mindful of max character limit.\n\nA: I had this same error, but I found my problem... I was using a bootable usb to install ubuntu 18, but instead of partitioning the hard-drive, it was partitioning itself. \nIn conclusion, check to make sure the space you are trying to partition is your hard-drive and not the usb. Sometimes you need to configure the BIOS to allow the hard-drive to be re-partitioned. \n", "Q: deploying openstack on 6 servers I'm new to openstack and i'm still learning. In 2 month i'll get 6 servers like: \n\n\n*\n\n*4 servers with dual xeon e5-2630 , 96gb ram, 2 1gb ethernet and 2 500gb hdd in raid\n\n*1 DAS with 40tb of storage (10x4tb HDD) \n\n*1 server with single xeon e5-2630 with 16-32 gb of ram.\n\n\nI has a few questions for this setup and with openstack in general:\n\n\n*\n\n*i practically has 3 dedicated compute nodes, 1 compute+storage node(1 server+DAS) and 1      node/network controller. As i read the best practice for networking server is to have this service run on all nodes for redundancy as opposed to running on a single controller where is it fails then all the ecosystem fails too.What is your oppinion? Another thing is the colocation of services as i don't have the necessary number of hardware to deploy every service on it's private hardware. I was thinking that the controller should run the controlling part service of nova, the object storage server and block storage server and the compute+storage server should run nova+object storage+block storage. What do you think of this setup?\n\n*for the DAS should i use raid or not because i read somewhere that swift and opesntack in general doesn't get along very well with raid?\n\n*should i use openstack-networking or the newer quantum?\n\n*i'll use this servers for hosting, storage like dropbox and virtualization. Except the latter, the first 2 will run in VMs . The thing is that i don't understand how openstack works with available resources. Does it make a pool of the available ram, cpu, storage etc? The DAS will be connected to only 1 server. Reading and writing to disk uses ram memory for cache etc;my question is : will openstack fill the ram proportionaly on all nodes when reading or writing or will it use only the ram from where DAS is attached to?This is an important problem for me. Also, only having one machine with actual storage capability will it help adding 2 more 1gb ethernet to cope with intense requests on the storage server? Or should i distribute the HDD's to all servers and install the storage services on them?\n\n*i didn't find a good tutorial on how to deploy openstack using maas and juju, because it seems to be an easier setup then manual install.\n\n*how does openstack get along with amd opteron 6300 series? I'm asking this because there is a possibility that i could change from intel to amd, the latter being much cheaper so i can get for the same ammount of money twice and something the number of cores (e5-2630 being a 6 core with ht, and from what i understand i should disable ht)\nTo be continued when i will be confronted by other problems.\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: DISCLAMIER: I AM NOT AN OPENSTACK EXPERT. THE FOLLOWING IS MERELY AN OPINION AND MAY BE OUTDATED OR COMPLETELY INCORRECT. IN NO WAY CAN I BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSEQUENCES IN USING THE CONTENT BELOW.\nMulti-Hosting\nHaving networking services running on every node will have its advantages and disadvantages.\nMany different networking redundancy possibilities are possible including multi-hosting.\nMulti-Hosting requires adding an IP on the VM network to each host in the system, and you'll probably get a slight performance decrease on the compute host. \nIt's also possible to combine this with a hardware gateway to remove the need for your compute hosts to gateway, and they'd only need to DHCP and NAT for VMs.\nAnother noted disadvantage of Multi-Hosting is the additional uses of IP's in a subnet.\nTake a look at this document for more info.\nIn my opinion, it's probably a good idea to multi-host.\nRAID\nThe Openstack documentation recommends you do not use RAID, the reason being that Swift is very write-heavy and performs very poorly with most parity-based RAID (e.g. RAID 5 or the more complicated RAID 26).\nDon't forget to backup your data, of course!\nOpenstack-Networking vs. Quantum/Neutron\n\n\n*\n\n*Openstack-Networking seems to be a more mature stack in terms of time in the field and resources for learning.\n\n*Quantum/Neutron seems to be designed to be more extensible and easier to manage.\n\n*Quantum/Neutron does not support multi-hosting and will not in the future.\n\n*I really can't give an honest opinion, as I have personally worked with neither and cannot easily find a good discussion on the two. I'd say go with the one your team is comfortable with and provides the options you need.\n\n\nDistribution of Resources\nI really can't help as much as I would want here. I'd give this article a read, and ping the IRC Channel.\nInstalling with MAAS and Juju\nUbuntu provides a tutorial for Ubuntu Cloud Infrastructure installation with MAAS and Juju.\nCPU: Intel vs. AMD\nI cannot find any good information whether AMD or Intel is better for Openstack. Based on the absence of information on the subject, I would think there's very little disadvantage. The Openstack Documentation refers to both AMD and Intel chips in a similar fashion.\nThe page only states that AMD-V is required, and the Opteron 6300 specifications page states it does.\nOn the topic of hyper-threading, it will double the logical cores, and that may be good. It's recommended you stress-test both configurations to see which is faster. \nMore Help\nAsk Ubuntu may not have been the best location to ask these kinds of questions. \nTry these places if you have questions or want a professional opinion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Openstack IRC Channel\n\n*Openstack Q&A\n\n*Openstack Mailing Lists\n\n*Openstack User Groups\n\n*Server Fault\n", "Q: Comcast Xfinity TV videos will not launch just installed ubuntu 12.04 lts on my old XP desktop.

You have Intel SRT which (somehow) uses RAID to access the SSD.

Should I really consider removing Ubuntu, since I am worried I am going to lose my Win 7 again ?\n\nA: Is this a newer computer with UEFI (and BIOS)? \nMany then have Windows in BIOS mode, but when booting Ubuntu the UEFI/BIOS may boot in either UEFI or BIOS mode and install in that mode.\nOr a few Windows 7 systems were installed in UEFI mode and you installed Ubuntu in BIOS mode.\nEither way, to dual boot from grub menu both systems have to be either UEFI or both BIOS.\nBest to see details and Boot-Repair can convert a BIOS install of Ubuntu to UEFI or vice-versa. You cannot easily convert Windows from its current install.\nPost the link to the BootInfo report that this creates.

Every time I start my browser I have to login to my yahoo email.  Also sometimes I have to login into gmail, or facebook or linkedin.  \nWhen I used windows I did not have to keep logging into my accounts except maybe every two weeks or so.\nWhat do I need to do to stay logged in?\n\nA: Usually websites will have a \"Remember Me\" or \"Remember Password\" option. Make sure that is checked if you want to avoid typing in your password.\nIf you use Firefox, it would be advisable to set up Sync (Tools > Set Up Sync). This will help Firefox remember your passwords, which will be stored in a database. Sync will allow you to keep your history, Bookmarks, Passwords, Settings, and Addons consistent across multiple installations of Firefox on multiple devices.\n\nA: Chromium saves all my passwords and automatically logs in when I open the browser.\n\nA: As mentioned by searchfgold6789 you want to check the \"Remember Me\" or similar option so \"the password\" is saved.\nActually, the way this feature works on any website is by using a cookie. If you have checked those options and it still logs you out, that means Firefox is not saving the cookies between sessions. By default, Firefox is setup to not delete the cookies. However, you may have changed those settings and that means you lose \"the password\" each time you close Firefox and restart it.\nLook at your Firefox settings you may find that the cookies get deleted. This is in the about:config page. Click on the button that appears and in the filter enter cookie to see what you get there. For example:\n network.cookie.lifetime.days  default  integer  90\n\nIf that number is 1, then it would \"forget\" the cookie within 1 day.\nAnother reason why you may lose your session: if you use the same account from several computers, the website you are accessing may log you out of the older sessions. However, if that's the case you should see the same effect in all browsers and all OSes (i.e. log under Windows IE, then in Firefox, then back in IE you would be logged out.)\n", "Q: Wireshark HTTP request methods for GET and POST on wlan0 I can't seem to get the right information using Wireshark. \nI'm capturing on my wireless network, and I want to be able to inspect packets coming from users on my network. \nAfter capturing, I apply this filter:\nhttp.request.method == \"GET\" || http.request.method == \"POST\"\nThe packets that come from my machine have my IP address as source, and the destination in plain text, such as \"askubuntu.com\".

I can't even ping those addresses (host unreachable).\n\nA: \nWhen I try to use a DNS lookup on the addresses given by other machines on the network, they don't turn up anything.\n\nWell, Wireshark's using DNS to translate IP addresses to names, so there's your answer.  If there were DNS entries for them, they'd get resolved.  Perhaps some other address-to-name resolution mechanism allows the IP address for your host to be resolved on that host.\n(And, no, this has nothing whatsoever to do with the false claim that \"|| behaves like && and && behaves like ||\".)\n", "Q: Efficient way to clear selections and select new item in KDE Dolphin in one step? I prefer KDE's default single click behavior in all cases except the following:\nStarting situation: \n\n\n*\n\n*I have one or more files (or folders) selected already (from some previous action)\n\n*I want to perform a different action (such as deleting) on a new file\n\n\nThree steps are required:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have to first manually clear the existing selection (such as using escape)\n\n*Then I have to select the new file \n\n*Then I have to perform the action on the file\n\n\nIf I instead used double-click as the default, it would eliminate at least one of those steps. But I want to keep using single click behavior. \nMy question is how can I most efficiently clear an existing selection and make a new selection (either files or folders) in one action?\nThe suggested method should not rely on right clicking (because the action I want to perform may not be in the context menu). And the method should not mix mouse and keyboard actions -- it should use one or the other for efficiency & simplicity.\nIdeally, I want something as simple as the way it would work if I used double-click actions. In that case, a single left mouse click on a new item would clear prior selections and select the new item.

I'm looking to deploy my Django application using juju. Quickly looking over the charm store, I noticed there are two different charms to do this. One simply named python-django and another called django-rainbow.\nThe python-django charm is described like:\n\nThis charm will install Django. It can also install your Django\n  project and his dependencies from either a template or from a version\n  control system. It can also link your project to a database and sync\n  the schemas. This charm also come with a Fabric fabfile to interact\n  with the deployement in a cloud aware manner.\n\nAnd django-rainbow like so:\n\nDjango-rainbow is a full-fledged Django web project deployment charm.\n  One can deploy many projects onto a single instance by maintaining\n  individual config files pertaining to the project. Django-rainbow is a\n  safe and convenient platform for development or production web server\n  management. Web sites are updated instantly using mercurial based\n  versioning. Your django-rainbow project file can be stored for future\n  use, allowing anyone using juju a fail safe method to  develop and\n  deploy your project without creating conflicting structure.\n  Django-rainbow is a \"Set it and forget it\" platform leaving\n  development issues with the developers :)\n\nWhat are the differences and why would I choose one over the other?\n\nA: \nWhat are the differences and why would I choose one over the other?\n\nBoth charms are similar in term of functionality but differ in there completeness.\nDatabase support:\ndjango-rainbow support only mysql and not as a relation but installed in the\nsame unit that the django project is installed.\npython-django support only postgresql for now. But mongodb and mysql are on the way (see https://code.launchpad.net/~patrick-hetu/+junk/python-django-mysql-support)\nWSGI:\ndjango-rainbow support apache2 and you need to configure your vhost manually in the charm's configuration file.\npython-django works with a wsgi relation for now only a Gunicorn subordinate implement the interface.\nOnly in the django-rainbow charm:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can configure the domain name of your django.contrib.sites app.\n\n\nOnly in the python-django charm:\n\n\n*\n\n*a website relation (for load balancing for example)\n\n*a Memcached relation\n\n*an upgrade hook (upgrades packages, requirements.txt, pip, etc)\n\n*a Juju compatible fabfile to interact with your Django deployment\n\n*it can be extended via application subordinate charms (see the section in the README)\n\n\nLow level:\n\n\n*\n\n*the django-rainbow charm is written in bash while the python-django charm is written in python.\n\n", "Q: UFW python documentation I'm trying to access ufw with python, but on line 53 of backend.py, they raise a weird error  that makes no sense:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"mymodule.py\", line 1467, in <module>\n      print backend.UFWBackend('notused', False).get_rules()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ufw/backend.py\", line 53, in __init__\n      self._read_rules()\nAttributeError: UFWBackend instance has no attribute '_read_rules'\n\nHere's the code that raises this error:\nbackend.UFWBackend('notused', False).get_rules()\n\nThere are minimal comments and doc strings throughout all of the code, and there unused and undeclared attributes and methods every where, so it's been complicated to navigate.\n\nA: So, I found it.

I decided to dual boot with WinXP, so I created a small partition and installed the OS. There was a little incompatibility with the processors that I fixed, but in the middle of using the OS, the desktop stalled so I hard reset the desktop by holding the power button for 3 seconds. I power back up, and I'm sent to grub rescue.\nI'm familiar with grub rescue's extremely limited command line. I check the \"set\" and the root and prefix is correct. So I try to load the normal.mod so that I could use the regular grub command line and boot manually from there.

Thank you!\n\nA: Actually apt-cache does not show you which packages or even versions of packages you have got installed on your system.\nIt just shows you detailed information of all available packages (and their versions) for your system. So do not worry about it.\nIf you want to clean up your system from old packages, dependencies and cached files (you may get a lot of free space after doing this):\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nIt's that easy.\n\nA: To answer your question about uninstalling, the command is:\napt-get remove <package name>\n\nif you intend to re-install the package later and:\napt-get purge <package name>\n\nif you don't want that package ever again.\nTo know what's installed, I suggest you use dpkg directly:\ndpkg --list | less\n\nThe pipe and less command is so you can easily scroll and search the results of the command. Note that all packages listed are not all installed. The first 2 or 3 letters to the left tell you the current status of the package. For detailed info, check out the man page:\nman dpkg-query\n\nIt explains each flag.\nOtherwise, as Юнгвирт Тони mentioned, the apt-cache show command shows the cache, not what you have installed. Not only that, on Ubuntu, if you installed X-Windows, you have a graphical installer. I don't use it and removed the icon, but you should be able to find something named \"Software Manager\" or alike in your menus or icons...\n\nA: To only remove earlier versions but keep the current version in the cache, use\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nDo not use apt-get clean.

Another problem that could occur may be that the user and group ids are varying between both systems but in most cases with only one user this shouldn't be a problem, in case there are problems, I think they can be fixed by special mount options in /etc/fstab but I'm not totally sure about that.\nI'd recommend using the home folder for ubuntu as it is and making symbolic links for data and configuration files you want to share between both systems.

But as the new node also changes the relation, it will result in all the other nodes running this again to pull the updated list of keys... very hackish to depend on a side effect but it was very concise..\ngood luck.\n", "Q: Ubuntu For Android! Pl. tell me how to install Ubuntu on Android Tablet or Phone.   Another thing is i'm not using Ubuntu Desktop and I'm using Windows. So tell me what to do to install Ubuntu on Android.\nThanks...\n\nA: I have found a link to ubuntu's wiki for the touch version with the instructions for a linux machine. Unfortunately I believe some steps require Linux to install ubuntu to a tablet.\nHere is the link for the Install based on a Trasnformer tablet but it must be rooted and I don't know your device but good luck!\nFor Windows, You must make sure that the Android Developer Bridge is installed as well.\nI found these instructions [http://]androidforums.com/lg-spirit-4g/692656-install-adb-windows-ubuntu-12-04-12-10-a.html (Not 10 rep so I cannot post two links.) for making that possible.

Having spent nearly 20 hours over the last two days trying to install two different distros of Linux (settling my attentions on Ubuntu) on two seperate Western Digital WD Blue WD10EZEX (1TB) Hard Drives, I've started to wonder whether or not certain Hard Drives are compatible with installations of Linux.\nAnd, if certain Hard Drives are incompatible, how would you go about telling whether or not they were? Would it be 'labelled on the box', so to speak?\n\nA: While I don't believe this is a question with a viable answer, here goes nothing:\nSome drives in my experience have failed because they were bad out of the box, others because of age. I usually recommend WD for disc drives because I haven't had many issues. If you were to ask for help installing Ubuntu can gave the errors you were having maybe someone could better assist.\nThat said, I have only ever seen the Tux-Approved logo ONCE and that was on a Toshiba drive in 2008. Once again I believe this question would be better placed in Meta AskUbuntu\n\nA: No; a drive is a drive.  You may want to instead ask a question about your specific issues to get help solving them.\n\nA: For the most part drives are compatible because they just require a standard driver, however there are some drives out there that require special drivers (eg gigabyte i-ram). I would not expect yours to be one as it's a standard sata drive. It's far more likely that your storage controller/raid card isn't supported. If it is your drive rather than controller then in your bios or UEFI you may be able to set your storage controller to act in legacy IDE mode, this can sometimes alleviate driver related issues, but it does come at the price of performance (minor loss), and lack of hot swapping. \n\nA: Not so, Debian jessie and the Seagate portable Extension hd is not compatible with automounting at bootup. It lterally takes hours to boot it and access is dead-snail slow. There are a number of blogs and os support support sites which are discussing this. I tried to use with Jessie and can personally confirm this. I have found no solutions but a work arond is to manually unmount and mount/remount after booting. I have found no contribution to the discussions from Seagate.\n", "Q: How to successfully install osu! using wine1.6? How can I completely and successfully install osu! using wine1.6?

Is there a secret key I need to push on boot-up for the option to boot from a usb drive?\nThanks, S\n\nA: \nIs there a secret key I need to push on boot-up for the option to boot from a usb drive?\n\nI don't know much about your particular computer, but if I had to guess, I'd say probably. Realistically, it depends on your computer's make and model.\nYou should pay close attention to your BIOS splash screen when you start the computer up, and look for something like Press (button) to select boot device. If this cannot be found, look for a button to to enter into your BIOS settings, and change the order of boot devices, prioritizing your flash drive.\nPlease note that some computer (especially older ones) cannot boot from USB. However, if you go to your manufacture's website, you may find a BIOS update that adds this function. If a newer BIOS cannot be found, assuming you can get your BIOS to boot from a \"smart\" boot manager, such as PLOP, you may be able to force your computer to boot from USB anyway, even though you BIOS doesn't support it.\nI should note if you push the pause button on your keyboard (usually located above the number pad on the right), your BIOS will freeze it self until you press a button on your keyboard (any button). This will probably make it easier to read what's on your screen.\nPS: your computer's manual is your friend! It can probably give a much more specific example as to how you boot from different devices than anyone here can.\n\nA: You will need to either set your computer to boot from usb first in your bios options, or you can use your boot list to boot to usb first just this time. The key to enter these varies by system. For me F2 enters bios settings, or I can use F11 to enter boot menu for a 1 time usb boot. I would suggest you try pressing F11 first, as it's a commonly used one for bios boot menus.\n", "Q: Wireless not working after update After installing a bunch of updates to Ubuntu 12.04, my wireless connection stopped working.

mail server which I can then use with email clients? I'm trying to set up a mail server on my Ubuntu 12.04 box from Linode. The box currently runs Apache, MySQL and PHP and runs a few of my websites, and I want to set up an email account like myname@mydomain.com. In the interest of learning, I'd like to go through the painful task of setting up my own mail server.\nI've seen lots of suggestions on how to do so, most involve using Postfix and Dovecot, but I'm really struggling to understand:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference is between both?\n\n*How to set them up properly to work together?\n\n\nI just want a mail server running IMAP which I can use a mail client like Thunderbird with.\n\nA: Postfix will handle smtp. That is: postfix is a server that handles receiving and sending emails. When I (frobenius@otherserver.com) what to send email to you (you@yourserver.com) that will cause otherserver.com to talk to postfix on yourserver.com . Same thing the other way. If you want to send email to me, that will cause postfix on yourserver.com to talk to otherserver.com\nNow IMAP is just a convenience. It will allow you to access your emails on other computers (than yourserver.com). You can think of emails as files in yourserver.com, and thunderbird just reading a remote directory (that is in yourserver.com)\nMy advice: Install postfix first, without dovecot. Test it (read and send email via the command line of yourserver.com). Then worry about IMAP.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 not booting after clean installation I have just installed Ubuntu 13.04 but it doesnt boot (I'm using \"try ubuntu\" option).\nI downloaded the iso that corresponds to my computer (amd x64) and I made a USB device bootable using the Universal USB Installer as http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows suggests.

Set up your firmware (BIOS) to boot the disk in UEFI mode.\nIn your BIOS, disable QuickBoot/FastBoot and Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT). If you have Windows8, also disable FastStartup.\nBoot your PC using the LiveDVD or LiveUSB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\". If you get a Secure boot or signature error, you may wish to disable SecureBoot as described here, then retry to boot the disk.\nIf the other systems (Windows Vista/7/8, GNU/Linux...) of your computer are installed in EFI mode, then you must install Ubuntu in EFI mode too.\nIf the other systems (Windows, GNU/Linux...) of your computer are installed in Legacy (not-EFI) mode, then you must install Ubuntu in Legacy mode too. Eg if your computer is old (<2010), is 32bits, or was sold with a pre-installed Windows XP.\nPartitioning:\nMount point: /boot/efi (remark: no need to set this mount point when using the manual partitioning, the Ubuntu installer will detect it automatically)\nSize: minimum 100Mib. 200MiB recommended.\nType: FAT32\nOther: needs a \"boot\" flag.\nSource:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting\n", "Q: Black screen after 13.04. How do I get the display back through the command line This is a common problem with Ubuntu. If I open the command line, something pops up really fast that says the BIOS disabled something. It let me login on the command line. I tried a bunch of commands that I thought would have opened or updated my bios. Nothing worked. Is there a way I can get my display working again through the command line?\n\nA: Have you considered looking into your BIOS settings? There is usually an \"Intel VT\" or \"Virtualization\" option that isn't enabled by default. This is being modified.\nIf you are unable to modify it in the Bios Try the following\nFirst of all, you might want to see if KVM is loaded in the kernel. To do this, run something like this:\nlsmod | grep kvm\nIf you do get any answer from that, you may want to stop kvm from running. To do that, this will help:\nmodprobe -r kvm\nRemember to follow for any other kvm module. In my case, there is also a kvm_intel module, so I also have to run modprobe -r kvm_inteland modprobe -r kvm_amd. \nTo stop kvm from being enabled at boot time you have to find the file located at /etc/modules and modify it so that KVM doesn't launch at boot time. After you modify your /etc/modules file restart your computer and see if the problem persists.\nI would recommend checking out the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernal modules Blocking using /etc/modprob.d\n\n*Keranal module blockin using kernal command Line(Try this if you have difficulty in booting)\n\n\nIf you do not use VMware you can run the following(It breaks VMWare)\nsudo apt-get purge kvm\n\nIf you want to still continue using quemu with KVM\nlook for a more recent BIOS on the vendor's web site.\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*On some hardware (e-g HP nx6320), you need to power-off/power-on the\nmachine after enabling virtualization in the BIOS.\n\n*Enabling some BIOS features may break VT support on some hardware\n(e-g Enabling Intel AMT on a Thinkpad T500 will prevent kvm-intel\nfrom loading with \"disabled by bios\")\n\n*On some Dell hardware, you also need to disable \"Trusted Execution\",\notherwise VT will not be enabled.\n\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu 32 bit in a 64 bit machine?

I bought a new hard disk and wanted to copy all files in a ntfs partition to another ntfs partition. These files are pdf files and bak files used both by win7 and ubuntu.\nCan Rsync be used to sync files in a ntfs partition to another ntfs partition?\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, you can use rsync to copy data between ntfs partitions. Use the -r (or --recursive) option to have rsync go through the entire folder structure below the source folder and recreate the folder structure and files on the destination.\nFor volumes that support linux permissions, we would typically use the -a (--archive) option to create an identical \"mirror\" copy. The -aoption preserves the time stamp and all other attributes of the source files.\nOn ntfs volumes, that do not support linux permissions, you still can use the -t (--times) option to preserve the time stamp of the files.\nFor using rsync on file systems with less accurate or different date stamps, you can decrease the accuracy by which rsync compares time stamps in order to decide whether a file has changed or not. This is done with the option -@ or --modify-window, e.g. -@=2 would consider files where the time stamps differ less than 2 seconds as the same.\n\nA: rsync is originally unix utility to sync source and destination. Now rsync is even ported to windows as well. You may need cygwin or mingw on windows machine for the same.\nOnly condition is that both operating system should see each other's filesystem and ssh should be enabled both side.\n\n\nrsync -avz -e ssh /cygwin/c/song.mp3 root@192.168.56.101:/data\n\n\n\nA: You can install rsync in cygwin on Windows and do the data copy. Just like you are in a *NIX terminal session.\nThe path naming is a bit different.\nFor example, if you want to copy all data from partition E: to F: => rsync -av --progress --stats /cygdrive/e /cygdrive/f\nBTW: Not sure if rsync for cygwin is capable of keeping all the NTFS properties/attributes. Most likely yes. But it loese attributes, permissions when copying from NTFS -> *NIX file systems.\n", "Q: Service modules-init-tools not found While setting up lm-sensors and fanconrtol packages on Ubuntu 13.04, I arrived at a stage were I had to restart the service modules-init-tools to apply changes to the /etc/modules file then alas!

But I want to know where the service is or if it has been replaced how do I restart it from terminal without doing a reboot.\n\nA: \"modules-init-tools\" is not a service, it is a package that provides commmands to manage kernel modules.\nThe commands inside this package are lsmod, modprobe, rmmod, etc.\nPut that, what makes sense is if you need to restart a module, and not a service with \"modules-init-tools\".\nJust for information, \"modules-init-tools\" was replaced by \"kmod\" recently in 13.10, and I am not sure if for 13.04, but kept compatibility with previous commands and you can use, if it is the case in 13.04, 'rmmod' and 'modprobe' as before. No changes to the syntaxe!\n\nA: Although module-init-tools is a package, it also provides a service, such that you could automatically load modules configured in /etc/modules by running\nservice module-init-tools start\n\nAs @vitorafsr explained, module-init-tools has been replaced with kmod.

I'm running windows 8. On my Desktop. Its a little old actually. The CPU is Pentium D with 1.5GB RAM. But I don't think that's a problem for Ubuntu 13.04. \nI used Ubuntu 12.04 besides Win7. But this time I'm unable to install Ubuntu. Actually there is no error. I've tried. Install ubuntu,  try ubuntu without installing and the installation helper. But the same thing happens each time.

We all have Windows, except for the server of course.\nPlease help. Also i'd be great to make a noob friendly guide, i'm not very good with Linux.\n\nA: Yes, there are (at least) two possible ways. \nThe easiest is to simply share your printer via CUPS.

When you install a virtual box drive, it creates a compressed file containing the entire OS that you installed (Ubuntu in this case), as well as some Virtual Box software dependencies to make it all run.  It will not be detected by any partitioning software.  \nWith this in mind, it might be easier to think of the Virtual Box Drive as a large, 125GB application or file, rather than a partition.\nIf you have allocated too much space to the Virtual Box drive, you have to open the Virtual Box Manager, and delete the entire drive and start over.\nVirtual Box Drives only get bigger, not smaller.  All that 125GB of data is being used, mostly by trash data, with only ~8GB or whatever space you have there allocated for Ubuntu. \nThink of the trash data as the blank white space on a picture.  It's not empty, it's white (but in this case, many bytes of data).  With that in mind, remember that that file, 125GB will always have that white space, and repartitioning from WITHIN the virtual Ubuntu OS will only create a smaller partition, with junk blank partition space, which will still belong to the 125GB file.\nTL;DR\nYou have to delete the virtual drive altogether, from the Virtual Box Manager, and restart from scratch with a more desirable setup.\n", "Q: random lines with delay in between I am using the following package to pull random lines from file(s) where line delimiter is %\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/rl.1.html\nrl -c 10 -d % myfile.txt\n\n-c 10 gives 10 lines as output.\nHow can I force it to sleep for some specified amount of time after each line it prints?\n\nA: From reading the man page, it seems that there is no such option built into rl, so you will have to use something else to achieve that. For example, you can do it with for:\nfor i in `seq 10`; do rl -c 1 -d % myfile.txt; sleep 5; done\n\nThat will make it \"sleep\" for 5 seconds between each execution. Note that -c option is now 1. This way, there is the risk that the same line might be selected twice within the 10 repetitions. Another way to do the same thing without that risk is:\nrl -c 10 -d % myfile.txt | while read line; do echo $line; sleep 5; done\n\nI hope this is helpful.\n", "Q: Creating a custom keyboard layout isn't working I want to replace my alt keys with my control keys and then place the alt keys on the two menus keys besides the control key.

You need to install the package build-essential for making the package and checkinstall for putting it into your package manager. These can be found on the install CD or in the repositories, searching in Synaptic Package Manager or the command-line apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall\n\nAnd since you may want to get code from some projects with no released version, you should install appropriate version management software.\nsudo apt-get install cvs subversion git-core mercurial\n\nYou should then build a common directory for yourself where you'll be building these packages. We recommend creating /usr/local/src, but really you can put it anywhere you want. Make sure this directory is writable by your primary user account, by running \nsudo chown $USER /usr/local/src\n\nand, just to be safe \nsudo chmod u+rwx /usr/local/src\n\nAfter you've done this, you're set up to start getting the programs you need.\nStep 2: Getting the software you want\nMost of the software you'll generally want comes from released tarballs. These are just compressed archives with extensions like .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 — they are just like .zip files on Windows or .sit on MacOS X, if that analogy helps you. If the program you want to install comes in this form, you should move it into the /usr/local/src directory we made in Step 1 and extract it by right-clicking on the file and selecting Extract Here, or by using the command line: If your tarball is a .gz, extract the files with the command:\ntar -xzvf tarballname.tar.gz\n\nand for bz2 the similar command:\ntar -xjvf tarballname.tar.bz2\n\nIn the rare case of getting a program from a cvs or subversion repository, the developers will generally provide instructions on how to do this on their website. If you already installed the packages listed on Step 1, you just need to change to your /usr/local/src directory (cd /usr/local/src) and run the commands that are listed. The procedure will vary from program to program, so I can't help you here, but with the given packages the instructions they provide should work smoothly.\nNote: If you downloaded from source such as Git, SVN, or any other source repository then it is likely that the ./configure files have not yet been generated. You may be able to run the command\nautogen.sh \n\nfrom within the downloaded files top directory. This command relies on automake and autoconf programs and will automatically build the configuration files and run the  ./configure  command. After this step you can resume the later directions by running the command \nmake \n\nStep 3: Resolving Dependencies.\nOne nice thing about modern Linux distributions is they take care of dependencies for the user. That is to say, if you want to install a program, the apt program will make sure it installs all needed libraries and other dependent programs so installing a program is never more difficult than just specifying what you need and it does the rest. Unfortunately with tarballs this is not the case, and you'll have to do it manually. It's this stage that trips up even some fairly experienced users who often give up in frustration for not being able to figure out what they need to get.\nYou probably want to read about the possibilities and limitations of auto-apt first, which will attempt to take care of dependency issues automatically. The following instructions are for fulfilling dependencies manually:\nTo prepare, install the package apt-file, and then run sudo apt-file update. This will download a list of all the available packages and all of the files those packages contain, which as you might expect can be a very large list. It will not provide any feedback while it loads, so just wait.\nThe apt-file program has some interesting functions, the two most useful are apt-file search which searches for a particular file name, and apt-file list which lists all the files in a given package. (Two explanations: 1 2)\nTo check the dependencies of your program, change into the directory you created in step two (cd /usr/local/src). Extracting the tarball or downloading from cvs/subversion will have made a sub-directory under /usr/local/src that contains the source code. This newly-created directory will contain a file called \"configure\", which is a script to make sure that the program can be compiled on your computer. To run it, run the command ./configure This command will check to see if you've got all the programs needed to install the program — in most cases you will not, and it will error out with a message about needing a program.\nIf you run ./configure without any options, you will use the default settings for the program. Most programs have a range of settings that you can enable or disable, if you are interested in this check the README and INSTALL files found in the directory after decompressing the tar file. You can check the developer documentation and in many cases ./configure --help will list some of the key configurations you can do. A very common options is to use ./configure --prefix=/usr which will install your application into /usr instead of /usr/local as my instructions do.\nIf this happens, the last line of output will be something like \nconfigure: error: Library requirements (gobbletygook) not met, blah blah blah stuff we don't care about\nBut right above that it will list a filename that it cannot find (often a filename ending in \".pc\", for instance). What you need to do then is to run \napt-file search missingfilename.pc\n\nwhich will tell you which Ubuntu package the missing file is in. You can then simply install the package using \nsudo apt-get install requiredpackage\n\nThen try running ./configure again, and see if it works. If you get to a bunch of text that finishes with config.status: creating Makefile followed by no obvious error messages, you're ready for the next steps.\nStep 4: Build and install.\nIf you got this far, you've done the hardest part already. Now all you need to do is run the command \nmake\n\nwhich does the actual building (compiling) of the program. \nIf it's a large program or if you've got a very slow computer, go and get a cup of coffee or something. If you have a multi-core processor you can also set the variable CONCURRENCY_LEVEL to the number of processors/cores you have to speed things up a little.\nWhen its done, install the program by typing\nmake install.\nYou probably want to use\nsudo checkinstall\n\nwhich puts the program in the package manager for clean, easy removal later. This replaces the old sudo make install command. See the complete documentation at CheckInstall. \nNote: If checkinstall fails you may need to run the command like \nsudo checkinstall --fstrans=0\n\nWhich should allow the install to complete successfully\nHere is the information on compiling and installing on ubuntu :  \nCOMPILING AND INSTALLING ON UBUNTU\n", "Q: How to monitor my data limit on a mobile broadband connection?

Is there any chance do anything in Hardware without changing the CPU?\nNote: the built-in CPU-limiter in vBox doesn't work.\n\nA: I COULD be wrong, but it could be a hardware issue.  You need to provide more details.  Full system specs, CPU, GPU, PSU, HDD, and RAM.  As much information about these as you can.  So don't do anything drastic like buy a new PSU or CPU based on this advice!\nIt's possible a power fluctuation is causing the trouble. If your processor is overclocked, it could easily be causing this. It's common for overclocked processors to run fine under normal conditions and then cause your computer to randomly crash.  This is caused by power fluctuations, and THOSE are caused by electrical noise of a variety of sorts.  Your PSU doesn't provide a perfect stream of power, and under certain conditions, it fluctuates more, sometimes too much, and the CPU shut down when an incorrect voltage is received. \nSimilar problems can arise with any component in your computer, the two most common I find, being the RAM and the CPU.  My RAM has to be manually revolted to 1.65V, because that is it's specified range, but my Mobo automatically sets it to 1.5V for whatever reason.  Cleaning up glitches like that will stabilize your system.\nIf you have extra components, or another PC, try swapping parts (PSU, RAM, GPU) as well and see if any of that stops your random crashing.  It could be a voltage glitch, or your PSU may need to be replaced for all we know.  \n\nA: This could be at least two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Many BIOS have a setting to halt the CPU (to prevent damage to the CPU) once it reaches a certain temp.\n\n*There's issue which plagued me for months with an HP P7-1240 (AMD A10-5700) where the default 'ondemand' CPU governor can result in a hang. I switched to use 'conservative' instead and the problem has not reoccurred.\nYou need to either build a kernel which does this by default or change it ASAP once you login.\nOne problem I am seeing is that even if I build the kernel that at some point soon after I login it will be changed back to 'ondemand'. I don't know what is changing it. Changing it back to 'conservative' seems to 'stick'. [1]\nFrom the documentation for CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_CONSERVATIVE (emphasis added):\n\n'conservative' - this driver is rather similar to the 'ondemand'\n  governor both in its source code and its purpose, the difference is\n  its optimisation for better suitability in a battery powered\n  environment.  The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased\n  rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.\nIf you have a desktop machine then you should really be considering\n  the 'ondemand' governor instead, however if you are using a laptop,\n  PDA or even an AMD64 based computer (due to the unacceptable\n  step-by-step latency issues between the minimum and maximum frequency\n  transitions in the CPU) you will probably want to use this governor.\n\nEDIT: [1] Found it.

(This disables the Amazon shopping lens and any lenses that are part of the Smart Scopes feature present in 13.10 when you upgrade.)\n\nAs a point of clarification: the portion you're talking about with the Record Activity settings is actually only a local feature. There is a program called Zeitgeist which keeps track of your most recently opened files and applications (Zeitgeist is also used by the GNOME desktop environment, actually). This is only used to prioritize results in the Dash; none of that information is ever transmitted to Canonical or even leaves the computer.\nIf that is still a privacy concern for you, by all means, still turn it off, but if you're only worried about the information that is leaving your computer, you just need to turn off the setting for including online results in the dash.\nPersonally, I find Zeitgeist to be helpful, so I leave it on.\n\nA: *\n\n*Search for System Settings in the Dash\n\n*Go to Privacy\n\n*At the bottom of the window you will see \"Record Activity\"\n\n*Set this setting to \"OFF\"\n\n\nYou can also turn Include online search results off from this same screen.\n", "Q: Graphic Error When Install Ubuntu 12.04 Guest on VMWare Player I'm using windows Vista 32 bit, and I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 by using vmware player.\nBut after I install it, the Ubuntu desktop looks like this :\n\nCan someone help me please, is this a compatibility issue?\nThank you.\nEDIT :\nI tried using VirtualBox, but the I can not enter the desktop at all, I got stuck in tty, and if I pressed F7, this screen came out :\n\n\nA: It's probably Unity or some other dependency of it.

Edit the wireless connection Becks as here: \nMark it to connect automatically and fill in Becks BSSID (MAC address) to tell Network Manager that you wish to connect to only Becks and only the MAC address you specified.\n\nA: When your computer tries to associate with the AP or access point that has the mac address BSSID 00:18:84:23:50:4a, this is where your problem begins because your BSSID for Becks is listed as 1C:C6:3C:35:FC:44. Also, 00:18:84:23:50:4a appears to be using WEP and your netowrk uses WPA authentication.\nFirst, use a terminal to navigate to '/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections' with sudo. Gnome and the Ubuntu desktop use nautilus, Kde uses dolphin, and XFCE uses thunar but here I will show nautilus for the purpose of explaining this.\nsudo -i nautilus '/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections'\n\nCheck to see if this folder contains any profiles saved for networks you do not use. You must have some configuration for the network your computer was trying to connect to. Deleting any unneeded profile will prevent future attempts to automatically connect to these networks. You should only have profiles here for the networks you want to keep.\nNow to the internet. If your computer shows a connection to the router but you can't get a connection to the internet, you may be having some kind of a subsequent issue. The loss of connectivity may have resulted in the loss of an external DHCP lease and you may need to reset your modem.\nSome routers use a single external DHCP lease from the modem for the main wired connection to the internet, generating an individual internal DHCP lease for each of your devices to use on the local network automatically. This allows devices to connect without having to obtain a new lease. Other times, each individual device on the network is assigned an external lease depending on the type of router and settings you use.\n\nA: The message Limiting TX power to is generated by mac8021 module/subsystem.\nIt's the implementation of Transmit Power Control/Management (TPC) from IEEE 802.11h-2003 for 5GHz.

I want to create a shortcut for a command in terminal. Like for a command\n \"ssh user@123.45.7.123\",\nI just want a command \"user\" and the above command will run.\nIs this possible, and if so how can it be done?\nThank you!\n\nA: Aliases can take parameters. For example:\n$ alias 777='sudo chmod -R 777 '\n$ 777 MyFolder\n\nwill perform chmod recursively on MyFolder\n\nA: The shortcuts for commands are known as aliases.\nThe syntax to create an alias is:  \nalias custom_command='original_command'  \n\nExample:\nFor creating an alias for update and upgrade we should type the following in terminal,  \nalias update='sudo apt-get update'    \n\nalias upgrade='sudo apt-get upgrade'  \n\nSo to create an alias for your command open the termianl and type:  \nalias user='ssh user@123.45.7.123'\n\n\nA: Generally the answer is to alias your command, as mentioned by M.Tarun. For your example with ssh you might want to add it to your .ssh/config:\nHost someName\n     HostName 123.45.7.123\n     User user\n\nThen call ssh with the name:\n$ ssh someName\n\nYour shell probably also has tab-completion for ssh. So you can just type ssh s and then hit Tab.\nThis also has the advantage that it works with other commands like scp:\n$ scp some-file someName:a/path/\n\nWhereas the alias approach would not work with this.\n\nA: If you want to not load the alias every time, to permanently store a alias command, do this.\nGo to your home directory and press Ctrl+H to view hidden files, one of these files would be .bashrc. Open it.\nNow write the following command anywhere in the mainspace:\nalias custom_command='original_command' \n\nYour shortcut command will be stored permanently.\n", "Q: Gradle in Ubuntu for Launchpad It appears that Ubuntu doesn't have new versions of Gradle in their repositories for some reason.

Gradle ships with its own Groovy library, therefore no\n  Groovy needs to be installed. Any existing Groovy installation is\n  ignored by Gradle.\nGradle uses whichever JDK it finds in your path (to check, use java\n  -version).

I've had a similar problem as you, but when I repaired from the Live CD, it actually fixed my problem.\nRecovering your data shouldn't be too difficult. The general process is as follows:\n 1. Boot into Live CD\n 2. Find your storage device\n 3. Mount your storage device\n 4. Mount your recovery storage device\n 5. Copy necessary files across  \n1. Boot into Live CD \nI won't bore you with the steps for doing 1 (since you've already done it).\n2. Find your storage device \nDepending on how your hard drive is partitioned, it might be a bit tricky to determine which partition is the one you need. My personal preference is to run:\nsudo blkid -c /dev/null\n\nThat should give you an output that has a number of entries that look like:\n/dev/sdxX: LABEL=\"LABEL_NAME\" UUID=\"UUID_HERE\" TYPE=\"FILETYPE\"\nYou're interested in finding the correct drive from information like the filetype and label name. Once you've correctly identified the correct drive/partition, then you want to take a note of x and X (from /dev/sdxX). You'll need that bit to mount your drive.\n3. Mount your storage device\nBefore you mount the drive, you need to create a folder to actually mount to. I suggest you create one in your home folder, such as (~/my_original_drive).\nOnce you've created that, you will want to run a command that is similar to the following:\nsudo mount /dev/sdxX ~/my_original_drive\n\nReplacing x and X from the letter and number derived from the previous section. \nFrom here, you should be able to access your data from the 'my_orignal_drive' folder. Have a look around in there and make sure everything is there as you expected.\n4. Mount your recovery storage device\nTo be honest, you shouldn't need to do much here if you're plugging in a USB stick (the newer versions of Ubuntu Live CD should mount these automagically). If it doesn't, follow the same steps above, but for your back-up device. It'll have a different /dev/sdxX and you'll need to create another folder to mount to.\nIf the backup drive does mount automagically, it'll be located somewhere under /media/\n5. Copy necessary files across\nOnce you've correctly mounted both your backup and source drives, it should just be a matter of copying and pasting!\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Unable to connect Nexus 4 with 12.10 Yesterday, when I'd connected my Nexus 4 on my laptop it still managed to read it and gave me the option for MTP or PTP.

I need to assign a password to the vnc server for the user, which is normally done using the vncserver command. However, it prompts for the user to enter and re-enter their password, neither of which the script is capable of doing. So, how can I set up the VNC password without an interactive prompt? \nThanks.\n\nA: As far as I know, the vncserver command only prompts for a password if the password file (by default, $HOME/.vnc/passwd) is absent - typically the first time it's run for a particular user. You could either script that initial vncserver interaction using 'expect', or pre-create the user's password file by calling the vncpasswd utility via expect before you run vncserver for the first time; e.g. [CAUTION: this is absolutely minimal, you should add some sanity checks if this is used in a serious environment]\n#!/bin/sh\n\nprog=/usr/bin/vncpasswd\nmypass=\"newpass\"\n\n/usr/bin/expect <<EOF\nspawn \"$prog\"\nexpect \"Password:\"\nsend \"$mypass\\r\"\nexpect \"Verify:\"\nsend \"$mypass\\r\"\nexpect eof\nexit\nEOF\n\nIf you don't want to (or can't) use 'expect', then there are various hacks available on the web - VNC passwords apparently use a form of DES encryption so searching with the terms 'VNC' 'DES' 'password' should get you what you need (I'm not going to link here since I cannot vouch for any particular one).\nFor completeness, note that the default Ubuntu 'Desktop Sharing' uses vino, and the password for that appears to be simply base64 encoded, so it is possible to set it directly e.g.\ngsettings set org.gnome.Vino vnc-password \"$(echo -n \"newpass\" | base64)\"\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: By slightly modifying steeldriver's version I was able to automate my usage of vncpasswd. Allows passing both the password and filename for vncpasswd to create.\nUsage: $ ./scriptname <filename> <password>\n#!/bin/sh    \n\nmyuser=\"$1\"\nmypass=\"$2\"\n\n/usr/bin/expect <<EOF\nspawn /usr/bin/vncpasswd $myuser\nexpect \"Password:\"\nsend \"$mypass\\r\"\nexpect \"Verify:\"\nsend \"$mypass\\r\"\nexpect eof\nexit\nEOF\n\n\nA: Was able to do it this way today (from a dockerfile at least):\nRUN printf \"password\\npassword\\n\\n\" | vncpasswd\n\n\nA: I found another way of doing this in a script (as root):\n#!/bin/sh    \n\nmyuser=\"asimov\"\nmypasswd=\"mysecret\"\n\nmkdir /home/$myuser/.vnc\necho $mypasswd | vncpasswd -f > /home/$myuser/.vnc/passwd\nchown -R $myuser:$myuser /home/$myuser/.vnc\nchmod 0600 /home/$myuser/.vnc/passwd\n\nCheers!\n\nA: In Ansible (requires pexpect to be installed on target):\n    - name: Set vnc password for tigervnc\n      expect:\n        command: vncpasswd /home/{{ UserName }}/.vnc/passwd\n        responses:\n          (?i)password: \"max8char\"\n          (?i)verify: \"max8char\"\n          (?i)\\(y/n\\): \"n\"\n\n", "Q: Partition installing ubuntu 13.04 I am installing Ubuntu on 250GB space. Entire 250GB for ubuntu, I would like to know what would be recommended partition sizes, also couple of terms like logical and primary partition is also what I would like to know. The intended use is for a home desktop (4GB RAM) with an towards programming and development.\nAny insights would be really appreciated.\n(This may be a repeat question, although I did search the forum, would be really helpful if I could be pointed to the right reference)\n\nA: A good partition setup for this purpose:\n\n\n*\n\n*swap: 8 GB. This is very safe amount of swap space for your amount of RAM. It will enable the Suspend to Disk option, if your graphics driver supports it.\n\n*/: 75 GB.

This is very optional - in fact, unless you plan on installing a whole other Linux distro besides Ubuntu, it will be less complicated to simply include this with /.\n\n*/boot: On modern hardware it is not necessarily helpful to have a separate /boot partition.\nThat said, to be perfectly honest, it is probably best to simply leave this up to the installer unless you have a specific reason for wanting to set up different partitions.

I'm running Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 using BURG as my bootloader. On my old drive grub/burg would load up instantly. However, now that I've replaced my old one with the new one, the computer just sits at the BIOS screen for about 30 seconds, and then \"grub loading\" comes up and I'm good. Googling \"grub takes 30 seconds to load\" brought up a bunch of other threads, but their problem was slightly different. In their problems they said that the computer sat at \"grub loading\" for 30 seconds. However, mine doesn't even show \"grub loading\" until the end of the 30 seconds. I'm not sure if this is a problem with grub or a problem with my bios/new drive. Furthermore, if I press f12 to go into the boot menu, and choose my hard drive manually there, grub loads up immediately. This is strange cause grub always loaded up immediately on my old drive.\n\nA: If the delay occurs before grub screen (or burg, doesn't make any difference) it's not a grub problem. Check your bios configuration, maybe your system is trying to boot from the old hardrive but since you added a new one, it spends 30 seconds looking for a media to boot that is not there anymore. Try to change the boot up sequence in the bios (can't help you about how to because that depends on the motherboard problem, but usually you can acces to the bios setup trough F2, F8, F10 or the DEL key before grub jumps in. Set the new hardrive as primary boot media.\nGood luck!\n\nA: 1) Reduce the default grub load time:\nyou can simply use the following command to open grub configuration:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub &\n\nAnd change GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 to GRUB_TIMEOUT=2. This will change the boot time to 2 seconds. Prefer not to put 0 here as you will lost the privilege to change between OS and recovery options.

What do you suppose I am leaving undone?\n\nA: Instead of trying to learn how to install packages that you downloaded from the internet and possibly may even require compiling, you should install your applications from the default Ubuntu repositories whenever possible. Just because you can't find an application to do a specific job in the default Ubuntu repositories doesn't mean that a suitable application is not there. In fact it usually is there. You just have to know how to search for it. The technical phrase that is used to describe this is \"software recommendation\".\nRegarding Apache OpenOffice, you should stick to the default LibreOffice that comes with the default Ubuntu install. It is very nearly 100% compatible with OpenOffice in every way, and receives its updates in the usual way through Software Updates.\nFinally, if you have to install a file that you downloaded that has a .deb extension, just double-click on it to install it using the Ubuntu Software Center. If the file that you downloaded has a .tar.gz extension, you will have to open it with Archive Manager and look for a README file in the archive where the instructions for installing the package are usually found.\n\nA: User,\nKarel is basically right on all counts. That is, your default LibreOffice should be able to open any document/spreadsheet/presentation, etc. that Apache OpenOffice can, and pretty much operates the way you are used to with what is now called Apache OpenOffice (AOO). The new OpenOffice maintainers just released v4.0, so I understand why you might want to try it out. \nI will guess that you selected the Linux Intel DEB (for 32-bit computers) or the Linux x86-64 DEB package from the table listed here: http://www.openoffice.org/download/other.html. Note: If your computer was made before 2009, use the \"Intel DEB\" version; if it's newer, use the \"x86-64 DEB.\" If you're not sure, use the \"Intel DEB,\" because newer machines can run the 32-bit, but 32-bit machines can't run 64-bit.\nThe Apache folks have complicated the download and install package process, by wrapping the DEB package in a tar.gz archive. So, as karel suggests, you first have to open the file with Archive Manager first, extract the DEB from the archive, then (finally) double-click the DEB. Ubuntu Software Center should then be able to install AOO safely.\nWhenever possible, use the Ubuntu Software Center to get interesting new programs. It will save you a ton of time and heartache. \n", "Q: Unable to mount Read-only file system Just bought a brand new external to back up my windows from ubuntu... since my windows isnt' accessible anymore...

Just spent a couple of days overcoming all sorts of minor problems and performing tweaks and downloading apps etc.. Having installing 12.04 (32 bit) onto an old Xp machine leaving windows in a separate partition for optional booting.\nBasically very impressed with everything. However have just hit a brick wall, ther does not sem to be a simple way of other users accessing each others files. Even the music files only seem to be available to the user that downloaded them. Surely Ubuntu does not require that each user has a complete duplicate copy of the music library. And how do two users have access to a commonly used file that they mutually update.\nWhat am I missing....?\n\nA: To answer part of your question, one thing that you could do is use the Ubuntu One cloud service and upload/sync files between multiple computers/users with that. I currently use it to sync my music library and documents between my desktop and laptop. I suppose it would work well enough for your purposes. \nIf you were desperate and wanted to just have a place where all users can put files to share with each other on one computer, you could use the Ubuntu installation disc to boot and create a new partition with g-parted, which would show up in Ubuntu as a completely different hard disc.\n", "Q: How can I turn down the sensitivity of my brightness slider? How can I make the brightness change in smaller increments?\nI red this before (How to increase the screen brightness control sensitivity?), but I didn't find the solution to help in my case.  \nMy laptop brightness is controlled by vendor specified hotkey (Fn+← & Fn+→), so there is no interface for OS (Ubuntu 12.10) to adjust brightness.\nWhen I try to adjust, the slider moves by steps of 40% (0-40-80-100 & 100-60-20-0). Is there a way to set the steps by 20%?\n\nA: I did it by setting acpi_osi= instead of acpi_osi=\"!Windows2012\"\nNow it works.\n", "Q: How to use iPhone 4S connection for Internet in Ubuntu 13.04 Is it possible to use a iPhone 4S's cell connection for Internet in Ubuntu 13.04 via the charger cable without jailbreaking? My Internet sometimes gets frustratingly slow and it would be handy to have a second way to get Internet. \nThanks in advance, ~Roy.\n\nA: It is possible. However it depends on your service provider whether it's free or not. You'll have to set a wifi hotspot using your device, this feature is in your settings on your device. Using the hotspot you can tether a connection that Ubuntu will automatically connect to when you plug your device in, or you can connect via wireless if your computer has wireless capabilities.\nI know on Verizon and AT&T both you have to pay to activate the hotspot feature on your device, that's the only catch, but otherwise it's as simple as enabling the hotspot and plugging your device in via usb.\n", "Q: Brightness can't be fixed I have problem with brightness on Ubuntu 12.04.

I have Kazam as screen recorder, but it does not have real-time zoom functionality. On youtube, I saw some videos recorded under ubuntu and they are zooming in-out while recording. Do you have any suggestions?\n\nA: On KDE, you can use the Meta (Windows) key and \"+/-\" to zoom in and out to the desktop. As long as you have a screen recorder such as recordmydesktop or SimpleScreenRecorder, you should be able to capture it just fine.\nI'm not aware yet of a screen recorder that zooms with its own software, but with SimpleScreenRecorder you have a lot of options such as a rectangle, window or screen to record and 'follow the cursor'.\n\nA: Try GTK record My Desktop.   \n\nGTK record My Desktop is a desktop session recorder for GNU/linux that\n  attemps to be easy to use, yet also effective at it's primary task.\n\nTo install, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

With older versions of Ubuntu (8.x at least) the bootloader was never installed on the same hard drive as Windows, if I chose to install Ubuntu to a separate hard drive. I normally have Windows on one hard drive and Linux on another. Note: Not different partitions, but different hard drives! And whenever I needed to boot into Linux I would just press F12 on POST and choose the hard drive with Linux on. That's it! But now, with latest Ubuntu versions it seems to overwrite the existing Windows bootloader, even if Ubuntu is installed on another hard drive? Why is that? And can this be changed when you install Ubuntu?\nThe hard drive with Ubuntu on is failing, and it is pretty much paper weight as of now. Sometimes it is not identified properly during POST and I get to the Grub rescue prompt. I get the \"no such device\" error because it awaits the failed hard drive. Because of this I was unable to boot into Windows. You can see the issue here.\n\nA: By default grub is installed on the first hard drive found.  If you choose manual partitioning when you install, you can select which drive to install grub to.\n", "Q: \"/var/run/utmp: No such file or directory\" when using do-release-upgrade Linux newbie here.

So here I have the basic \"hello world\" script for Objective-C, I have Ubuntu on my laptop and want to use Ubuntu to start compiling basic ideas, extra classes, or anything worth coding for any of my current projects on the go, so that way I can code a little bit wherever I am and not always have to be on my iMac.\n\nNow my only question is how do I build and run this code in terminal? Obviously it's not that important since I'm coding for iOS and OSX so the only code that will display is anything that doesn't call on the SDK's or Cocoa scripts, so basically it should only display basic text commands such as \"NSLog\" or whatever, you get the just of what I'm trying to do, which is what I want. That way I can check for small errors at the very least. \nI've looked around and I've found several helps for default shell scripts and such that call on the gcc directory or something of the sort from my understanding. I have created my own folder for Objective-C projects located in my documents and I had no idea if that is effecting my ability to run the file using the terminal commands that I've tried or not, but in case it is I store the projects in:\nHome>Documents>Objective-C>helloworld.m\nAlso when running the command line:\ngcc -o helloworld.m\n\nor this\ngcc -I/home/caseyerdmann/Documents/Objective-C/helloworld.m\n\nor any version of that command line I receive this error:\ngcc: fatal error: no input files\ncompilation terminated.\n\nI believe I have all the compiler files installed but I am not opposed to a full tutorial, whatever gets this running.

I just would love to get this running.\nI did some research and noticed the answers on this already are providing me with help to run the hello.m script that comes inside the GNUstep libraries, this is not what I am trying to do. However because I'm having trouble getting the default script to run I think I may have another problem as well, I'm going to continue researching to see if I can get that script to run, in the mean time any help is appreciated!\nUPDATE:\nI have tried a new command and yielded a new result, though it was also unsuccessful in compiling I think it may help answer others to answer this. This is what I tried:\ngcc -o helloworld.m -lobjc\n\nand this was the result:\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/crt1.o: In function `_start':\n(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, go ahead and install GNU objective-c compiler:\nsudo apt-get install gobjc  \n\nVerify the version:\ngcc --version\n\nmust say something like:\ngcc (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 4.8.2\n....\n\nInstall GNUStep development libraries (equivalent to Cocoa on macosx):\nsudo apt-get install gnustep-devel\n\nIt should work and compile with:\ngcc HelloWorld.m `gnustep-config --objc-flags` `gnustep-config --base-libs` -o HelloWorld\n\nYou should run with:\n./HelloWorld\n\n\nA: You're missing the name for executable file. So, the command should be like:\ngcc -o hello helloworld.m\n\nAfter compilation, type\n./hello\n\n-o hello specifies the name of the output file you wish to create once the source is compiled. (In this case the output file name is hello.) This will create an executable file (named hello) which you, then, can run directly from the terminal. If you don't use -o option while compiling, the name of the executable file will be a.out by default. Now to execute that program, you need to type\n./hello\n\nThe above commands assume you are already in the location of the source files, but both the source file and target output file may also be specified as a directory. For example:\ngcc -o ~/Projects/hello ~/Desktop/hello.c\n\nwill compile a C source file located on your desktop and place the executable binary in a Projects\nfolder in your home directory. To run this executable, type;\n./Projects/hello\n\nOr you can also first go to the directory where the source file is located and run above commands. You do not need specify pathnames if you're in the same directory where your source file is.\nI'm wondering why your file extension is .m instead of .c.\n\nA: I did a little research and found a solution that works for now. I'll probably post a new question to see if there is a way to shorten this. But this successfully compiles my code.

Perhaps BOOTMGR (the Windows Vista/Seven/Eight bootloader) has become damaged.\nIf you have a repair disk, I would try using the automatic repair utility to fix the bootloader.\nIf you don't have a repair disk, I would try booting from Hiren's Boot CD, running BootICE, and overwriting your Windows drives' PBR (partiton boot record) with BOOTMG. You can do this by selecting your hard drive from the dropdown list, and clicking Process PBR on the bottom of the Window. Unfortunately, I you can download Hiren's Boot CD from HERE.\nPlease note, you may have to disable UEFI to boot Hiren's. Also, If you have SATA, you may have to enter you BIOS/UEFI settings, and set your SATA controller to emulate an IDE controller. Otherwise, you might not be able to access your hard drives from the CD at all. After you are finished with he CD be sure to set your BIOS/UEFI settings back to whate they were before, or else Windows/Ubuntu might get confused by the changes, and fail to boot.\n\nA: If you are still trying to use the system as a dual boot system, you can go to http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/ and download that program and you will be able to edit you master boot record.\n", "Q: Starting from hibernate switches off the computer Since a batch of upates installed a few weeks ago, when the system starts from hibernation, after reading the saved hibernation state, on reaching the point that it switches to graphical mode, the computer powers off.

When it is started again the system boots normally (i.e. hibernation state lost/ignored.)\nI'm at a loss diagnosing this problem. I've looked into system.log, pm-suspend.log, dmesg... without seeing a trace of what happened on the de-hibernation process. I came here looking for advice on how to investigate this. If there is a more appropriate forum, please tell me.\nThe main suspects on the list of upgraded packages are libdrm, libkms and libc.

In theory, when this script detects the presence of environments that handle the power button press by themselves, it bails out. AFAIK, for KDE it tests for the presence of kpowersave, but it is missing on this system, so the script goes on and switchess off the computer. This happens just after the systems resumes from hibernation, because the script execution was freezed when the machine entered hibernation.\nI put an `exit' at the beginning of the script and now everything works fine.\n", "Q: /bin/sh is a symbolic link that doesn't point to /bin/bash I was installing the software environment of Armadeus experiment board APF27DEV, and when I tried the make command, it gave me the following error message:\nOn your system /bin/sh is a symbolic link that doesn't point to /bin/bash --> please correct that !\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 2013-08-03 20:57 /bin/sh -> dash\n\nTo resolve this error, I've tried to change all the shebangs from #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash, and I've also tried the following command:\nln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh\n\nBut, all that I've done didn't resolve the problem.

If I choose the \"Install\" option it says something along the lines of \"no root file system is defined\".\nMy computer is a gateway NE56R31U with windows 8 installed.\n\nA: Sounds like your have a machine with UEFI bootloader. That is a intel/microsoft protection plan from hackers. \nSounds like you booted into legacy from the bootloader and are trying to install from the live cd. Since the live CD would not work with UEFI in secure mode. \nBefore doing anything, watch the following series on youtube. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAnlhkbMang\nThe link is to the first one. They are three. They are high quality and put out by INTEL. It takes out a lot of the scare of the UEFI.  \nThey aren't that long, but explains a heck of a lot. They are a step by step of installing Windows8 and Ubuntu on a newly homebuilt machine, but you can pick up with the instructions after they install windows 8. Its the same as pre-installed. \nIt will take you through the process of unlocking the bootloader, adding a shim, and installing ubuntu on the same machine and partitioning the hard drive. Its the whole solution that I found. \nIf you install right now from where your at, you will have one operating system in Legacy mode and one in Secure UEFI mode. Not the easiest setup. \nAs for the machine not booting in Ubuntu after install, which is mentioned down below in the comments. The following page describes what I am explaining to you. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI.\n", "Q: How to increase power of wifi adapter How can I increase the tx power of my wifi adapter?\nI want to increase it more than the limit (15)\n\nA: You can increase power with this commandsudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower 20 but please do it in small increments if you set it to high you could destroy your device. Some devices will not accept higher power settings. You can set it to auto with sudo iwconfig wlan0 rate auto replace wlan0 with your connections name in iwconfig it is most like wlan0 or eth1.\n\nA: consider of installing a repeater or external router with good or directed antena. Increasing power is not recommended and not welcome by other users of other hotspots in your area as you will increase the wifi noise.

When I click a torrent link, it asks what I want to use, but I'm not sure where the application is actually located. Before it would just load Transmission by default. Any ideas about what to do?\n\nA: The Transmission binary (or link to the binary) is probably located in /usr/bin with the name transmission-gtk.\n\nA: By default, applications which start at session login time, can be managed by the following menu entry : Menu > Preferences > Startup Applications.  (Menu >  Preference > Application au démarrage in french).\nSo, you may want to put back the bittorent client into this list.  You only have to know that the command for launching the Transmission Bitorrent client minimised is \"transmission-gtk -m\" (without the quotes and with the space).  The two other fields \"name\" and \"comment\" will not change the behavior of Ubuntu but certainly help you.\nThe command for launching application may be found in the \"edit menu\" program.  It edits the desktops files, which is have a bit of complexity but this is an other story.\nSo, as a conclusion, type in your ubuntu program seach text box \"Startup Applications\", run the program and let you be guided by the graphical interface. \n", "Q: Chrome / Flash problems I just installed 12.04 LTS on my mother's Dell Inspiron 660s (all standard hardware straight from the factory except some extra RAM).

I uninstalled then reinstalled flash, I got the restricted repositories or whatever, and have done just about everything I could to try to get flash to work. How do I get flash to work?\n\nA: Netflix uses Microsoft's Silverlight plugin for their browser, not Flash...  As for Amazon, what doesn't work ? their movie service ? or the site in general ?\nWhat you could try is to run Firefox/Chrome under Wine which means you are running a Windows version of the software and it will be able to use the Silverlight plugin that should let you play netflix/amazon movies with their quirky DRM...\nhttp://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu\n", "Q: Permission Denied for driver-select Currently I'm new to Linux.

The title says it all: is AFP or Samba more secure for external access?\n\nA: Generally speaking AFP, CIFS/SMB (i.e. SAMBA) and NFS are not secure protocols, as they are designed to work inside a local 'trusted' network. \nYou may have some form of authentication but e.g. the traffic is not encrypted.\nIf you need secure access you should tunneling the traffic via SSH or even use a VPN.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"external access.\" Neither should typically be used except on a local network or VPN-secured WAN, as Mitch says. In addition to the traffic not being encrypted, these protocols are not designed to be exposed to the entire Internet; a vulnerability that would be considered critical for a service like SSH would often be considered only moderately severe for an SMB/CIFS or AFP implementation. The Windows implementation of SMB/CIFS has had many vulnerabilities, and while Samba on Ubuntu might possibly be more secure, I don't know of any studies that would indicate this.\nThere's another consideration, though.\nWindows hardly supports AFP. AFP is supported on OS X, but OS X also supports SMB/CIFS. Provided that you have arranged things for adequate security (for example, if people are accessing it over the Internet, this should only be through an appropriate VPN), you should probably use SMB/CIFS unless you know you won't have any native Windows clients (which seems unlikely, even for an Ubuntu or OS X shop).\nBut this might be a false dilemma.\nMultiple services can be enabled to afford access to the same files. You can even configure them with the same restrictions. SMB/CIFS (through Samba on Ubuntu), AFP, NFS, and a variety of other services can run simultaneously.\nOf course you shouldn't run additional services without reason--every additional service requires you (or some network administrator working for your organization) to learn how it works, make sure to configure it securely, and provide support, and each additional service somewhat increases your total attack surface as well.\nBut it's usually better to run more services than to do something with a service that it's not intended for.\nIn particular, if you need to facilitate access to files over the Internet without a VPN, then even if you already have SMB/CIFS, AFP, and/or NFS set up, you should still use those only on the LAN, and set up an additional, appropriate service for access to files over an unsecured network. SSH, with SFTP, is typically a good service for this.\n", "Q: Not able to connect to internet on Ubuntu I have a dual boot on my PC.\nI can access Internet through Windows but cannot do it through Ubuntu.\nI was able to connect to Internet on both OSses till some days ago, when my brother reset my router(or modem,I don't know) to factory settings and internet stopped working on both OSses.

Problems with FBReader I try to install FBReader via Ununtu Software Center, but it stalls for a long time and even after the process is supposedly complete, Ubuntu doesn't display epub and mobi files when I click them. It says \"There is no application installed for “Mobipocket e-book” files. Do you want to search for an application to open this file?\" and this process doesn't finish. What should I do?\nAlternatively, I need something to display epub/mobi files.\nMy internet connection is ok; e.g. I am able to install system via ubuntu netinstall without a problem.\n\nA: calibre \n\nOverview\nCalibre is a free and open source e-book library management application developed by users of e-books for users of e-books.\nCalibre is primarily a ebook cataloging program. It manages your ebook collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book, i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to ebooks in several formats. It also supports conversion from a dozen different ebook formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the \"Convert E-books\" button.\nSupported input formats are: MOBI, AZW, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS.\n\nStarting calibre's ebook viewer as a standalone application\nIn certain cases you will not want to add an EPUB or MOBI file to calibre's library before reading it. Luckily calibre's ebook viewer can be started independently via ebook-viewer. This makes it possible to create a standalone launcher:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=calibre\nExec=ebook-viewer %f\nName=Ebook Viewer\nComment=Display .epub files and other e-reader formats\nStartupWMClass=ebook-viewer\nMimeType=application/x-mobipocket-ebook;application/epub+zip;\n\nSee here for more information on adding launchers to your system.\n\nTo click an ebook and open in ebook-viewer, make this application (usr/bin/ebook-viewer) the default for that type of file.\n\nA: Try this. If you use Firefox browser, you can install EPUB Reader from its Add-On manager.\n", "Q: How can I make Ubuntu only boot from SSD?

After i installed TeamViewer 8 on Ubuntu 12.10, i noticed a running process under the name of 'teamviewerd', more specifically:\n/opt/teamviewer8/tv_bin/teamviewerd -f\n/opt/teamviewer8/tv_bin/wine/bin/wineserver\n\nand it auto-reopens whenever i try to kill it and i wonder why this happens.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Because that is the nature of teamviewer: it is build to respawn.\n/opt/teamviewer8/tv_bin/script/teamviewerd.sysv\nis probably responsible for it.\nTo stop teamviewer use:\nsudo teamviewer --daemon stop \n\nIt will show ...\ninitctl stop teamviewerd\nteamviewerd stop/waiting\n\nand it is gone ...\nrinzwind@discworld:/opt/teamviewer8/tv_bin/script$ ps -ef|grep teamviewer\nrinzwind 12712 12428  0 18:11 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto teamviewer\n\nCommands to manipulate the daemon:\nteamviewer --daemon status        show current status of the TeamViewer daemon\nteamviewer --daemon start         start TeamViewer daemon\nteamviewer --daemon stop          stop  TeamViewer daemon\nteamviewer --daemon restart       stop/start TeamViewer daemon\nteamviewer --daemon disable       disable TeamViewer daemon - don't start daemon on system startup\nteamviewer --daemon enable        enable TeamViewer daemon - start daemon on system startup (default)\n\n\nRegarding comment:\nFrom teamviewer 9 help:\n$teamviewer --help\n\n TeamViewer                      9.0.32150 \n\n teamviewer                      start TeamViewer user interface (if not running) \n\n teamviewer --help               print this help screen \n teamviewer --version            print version information \n teamviewer --info               print version, status, id \n teamviewer --ziplog             create a zip containing all teamviewer logs (useful when contacting support) \n\n teamviewer --passwd [PASSWD]    set a password (useful when installing remote (ssh) \n\n teamviewer --daemon status      show current status of the TeamViewer daemon \n teamviewer --daemon start       start      TeamViewer daemon \n teamviewer --daemon stop        stop       TeamViewer daemon \n teamviewer --daemon restart     stop/start TeamViewer daemon \n teamviewer --daemon disable     disable    TeamViewer daemon - don't start daemon on system startup \n teamviewer --daemon enable      enable     TeamViewer daemon - start daemon on system startup (default) \n\nOptions are still there in TV9.\n\nA: systemctl stop teamviewerd.service\nsystemctl disable teamviewerd.service\n\n\nA: If you install Teamviewer 10 from the .deb file, --daemon stop as recommended above won't work in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (and others?).  Don't know why.\nThe daemon is an 'upstart' job, so it gets controlled from /etc/init/teamviewerd.conf not /etc/init.d.  \nUnfortunately, for me, both initctl stop teamviewerd and service teamviewerd stop result in:\ninitctl: Unknown instance: \n\nteamviewerd.sysv gets installed in /opt.  So, to stop it, you need to do:\n$ sudo /opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/script/teamviewerd.sysv stop\n\n\nA: Here is the script \"teamviewer.bash\" I am using and that works in 14.04:\n#!/bin/bash\n# to be copied to /opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/script\n# modify /usr/share/applications/teamviewer-teamviewer11.desktop :\n# Exec=bash /opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/script/teamviewer.bash\n# sudo visudo\n# add:\n# user ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:/opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/script/teamviewer\n# sudo service sudo restart\necho 'teamviewer --daemon enable' | sudo sh && \\\n/opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/script/teamviewer && \\\necho 'teamviewer --daemon disable' | sudo sh\n\n\nA: teamviewer is using upstart to fire up the daemon at boot. The upstart does have a respawn set to keep a process running. As a 12.04 user mentioned, respawn stanzas in the upstart script are probably what you want to comment out.\nThe teamviewer process is/will run as root if fired up upstart. Since the respawn is in the upstart script you could have issues killing it permanently whether you do an implicit kill or 'sudo stop teamviwer' (the upstart way) or 'sudo teamviewer --daemon status'. Your best bet is probably just to comment out respawn lines in the upstart script, then start and stop as the service as needed.\n\nA: To stop the running procceses:\nsudo teamviewer daemon stop\n\nAnd to prevent it from booting again:\nsudo teamviewer daemon disable\n\nNote: Keep in mind, this most likely stop TeamViewer from working correctly (or not at all), you may need to enable the daemon manually once you actually want to use TeamViewer.\nOr remove the teamviewer package all together if you are not planning to use it.\n\nA: To stop Teamview daemon service\nsudo systemctl stop teamviewerd.service\n\nTo remove it from startup\nsudo systemctl disable teamviewerd.service\n\n\nA: I use Ubuntu 12.04, but I do not think the process will be different using other versions of Ubuntu.\nTeam Viewer screen sharing is my choice to replace the now \"TOO BLURRED TO READ\" Skype screen share. The window sizes are about the same on my screen, but I can now read the print whereas the Skype blur makes reading impossible.\nPlease note that although Team Viewer runs under Wine, there are many native scripts that also run.\nThere has been some notice of the \"TeamViewer remote control daemon\" (teamviewerd) remaining active after the user is finished using and terminated teamviewer. Respawning is also used to make sure it stays active. The easiest solution is to reboot or logout after making sure the 'start with system' check box is cleared. When you log in, team viewer should not start and the daemon should not appear.\nIf you want a solution that does not require logging out, you must delete the respawn commands from the configuration file.\nIn the terminal, enter:\ngksudo gedit -s /etc/init/teamviewerd.conf\nDelete the two lines:\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 5 60\nSave the file. Do not worry about the teamviewerd.conf.bak file.\nNow that respawn is disabled, ending the daemon will end it. I did not notice anything unusual in the way teamviewer functions with the modified script.\nNote: the changes will not initially take effect until teamviewer reads the script. Reboot, log-out, or terminate and restart teamviewer are options. I only tried log-out and it worked for me. I did not try the other options as I modified the script only once.\n\nA: I am using Ubuntu 14.04. I have no idea what the 'teamviewerd' process does, but I found that it is required to use TeamViewer. I use the 'gnome-system-monitor' to stop the 'teamviewerd' process when I reboot and when I am finished using TeamViewer. I 'continue' the process before I start using TeamViewer.The version I am currently using of the 'gnome-system-monitor' will ask for the authorization password when the 'stop' or 'continue' request is made. If your version of the 'gnome-system-monitor' does not ask for the authorization password and denies your request, you will need to start the 'gnome-system-monitor' in the terminal:   gksudo gnome-system-monitorIf you are not familiar with the usage of the gnome-system-monitor, follow these suggested steps:   select the 'Processes' tab   select the 'teamviewerd' process   right click and select 'Stop Process' or 'Continue Process'\n", "Q: Nemo file manager: How can I change font color of folder names in toolbar button?

I've been reading through some posts on how to install Python 2.5.4 in Ubuntu but I can not manage to find a solution to my problem. The version of Ubuntu I have is the 11.10 and the one of Python I intend to install is 2.5.4. It must be that one and not any of the updates since I am following a course which  uses specifically 2.5.4. I have already tried executing in the terminal commands proposed in other posts but I always get a mistake. \nI'd be really thankful I some could explain detailed and concisely how I can do it.\nAs said, thank you in advance,\nDionisio. \n\nA: open your terminal and do these steps one by one.\nwget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.4/Python-2.5.4.tar.bz2\ntar -zxvf Python-2.5.4.tgz\n cd Python-2.5.4\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nthat will install Python 2.5.4 in your Ubuntu.\nhope that helps.\n", "Q: Are there any tools for drawing on the desktop (drawing over apps)? I am wondering if there is anything similar to ink over apps for linux. i.e. , a program that allows me to draw over any other program given Xs architecture, it should be possible, but I looked for it and could not find it.\n\nEDIT: I have two good suggestions by Roman Raguet: one in his answer, and one in the comments.\nI'd like more suggestions, and, if possible, one that does not require a composite window manager\n\nA: EDIT:\nOption 1  (compiz composite manager)\nAs far as I read about the ink over apps application... you can try with the \"Annotate\" plugin in compiz.\n1) Intall the compizconfig-settings-manager, compiz-plugins and the compiz-plugins-extra packages running code below.\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins compiz-plugins-extra\n\n2) Open the compizconfig-settings-manager application.\n\n3) Go to the \"Extras\" category and enable the \"Annotate\" plugin.\n\n4) Click in the plugin to view and set the configuration.\n\n\n\n*configure the plugin according to your needs.. here you have an example.\n\n\nYou can launch whatever application, draw in it and use the shorcuts for the gnome-screenshot app like Alt + Print to take the screenshot of the windows you drew.\nOption 2  (with any composite manager eg: xfce, compiz, xcompmgr etc)\nAnother software to draw over the desktop is Ardesia.\n\nArdesia is the free digital sketchpad software that help you to make\ncoloured free-hand annotations with digital ink everywhere, record\nthem and share on the network. It is easy to use and impressively fast\nand reactive. You can draw upon the desktop or import an image and\nannotate it and redistribute your work to the world. Let's create\nquick sketch and artwork.\n\n1) To install Ardesia, open a Terminal and type:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install ardesia\n2) To open the app eg: Xubuntu.\nGo to Menu > Accessories > Ardesia Desktop Sketchpad\n\n3) You can draw over and app or your desktop and you can take screenshots with the Ardesia toolbar.\n\nOption 2.5\nIf you have a slow computer, you might want to try option 2 using lxde and xcompmgr (a lightweight composite manager)\nTo run lxde and xcompmgr,\n1) Install both programs\nsudo apt-get install lxde xcompmgr\n\n2) follow the instructions at How to start applications such as xcompmgr at start up? to get xcompmgr to start in lxde\nThis option works rather well, even on slow computers.\nOption 3  (without composite manager)\nAnother application to draw but without a composite manager is Pylote.\n\nPylote is a software making it possible to draw on the screen of the\ncomputer, like handling various instruments of geometry. It is a\nsoftware multiplateforme, free (license GNU GPL), made in Python\n(computer programming language) and PyQt4 (or PySide) for the\ngraphical interface.\n\nTo run Pylote you need first python (greater than or equal to 2.6) installed by default in Ubuntu, and python-qt4.\n1) Open a Terminal window and type:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install python-qt4\n2) Download the pylote.tar.gz file. (Pylote install GNU / Linux)\n3) uncompress the tar.gz file\n\n*\n\n*tar xvzf /path/to/pylote.tar.gz\n4) Enter in the pylote folder and make sure the file pylote.pyw has execute perms.\n\n*\n\n*cd /path/to/folder/pylote\n\n\n*chmod 755 pylote.pyw\n5) Run the pylote app with double click in the pylote.pyw file\n\n\n6) Take an screenshot after drawing over an app or your desktop. eg: scrot\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install scrot\nThen you can hit Alt+F2 and type\n\n*\n\n*scrot -s /path/to/your/screenshot.jpg\nwith the -s option you can select the area to take the screenshot and save at .jpg.\nHope this will helpful.\n\nA: You can use gromit-mpx. It allows screen annotating with line and textmarker tools of configurable color, varying them in thickness based on pressure (if you have a Wacom pen or similar). As requested, it does not require a compositing desktop manager, but will benefit if you have one.\nUsage under Debian / Ubuntu\n\n*\n\n*Install it:\nsudo apt-get install gromit-mpx\n\n\n*Start it with gromit-mpx.\n\n\n*Press the Pause key (or F9 key) and start painting on the screen. This is Debian/Ubuntu specific, as per man gromit-mpx.\n\n\n*Press Pause again to stop painting on the desktop, using it again \"like normal\".\nAlternatively, you can control the software from the command line (gromit-mpx --toggle to start/stop painting) or from a taskbar icon. The \"Toggle Painting\" menu item in the taskbar was the only one to not work for me, though.\nMore details on how to use this software. Also, see this video.\nUser experience without compositing\ngromit-mpx works work with both compositing and non-compositing window managers, but in the latter case it can be slow / sluggish [source].\nI used it without compositing. Using and scrolling the original windows below the annotations was always fast for me. Painting with gromit-mpx itself was initially fast but then became very sluggish (= painting low-polygon lines). After clearing the screen (gromit-mpx --clear) or erasing enough pixels, painting became fast again. The issue seems connected to the amount of painted pixels (not the amount of line segments). If you only need it for circling some 4-5 things on the screen and adding a word or two, no problem, but after that you want to use it with a compositing window manager. (xcompmgr is a lightweight one. See \"Option 2.5\" in @Roman Raguet's answer on how to set it up.)\n\nA: You can use GNOME Shell extensions Draw On You Screen:\n\nStart drawing with Super+Alt+D.\nThen save your beautiful work by taking a screenshot.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n*\n\n*Basic shapes (rectangle, circle, ellipse, line, curve, polygon, polyline, text, image, free)\n\n*Basic transformations (move, rotate, resize, stretch, mirror, inverse)\n\n*Smooth stroke\n\n*Draw over applications\n\n*Keep drawings on desktop background with persistence (notes, children's art ...)\n\n*Multi-monitor support\n\n*Export to SVG\n\nInstall\nInstall as any other GNOME Shell extension.

On a computer with Windows 8 pre-installed, activating legacy support in the firmware makes it possible to go down paths that will create new problems, and in fact that's precisely what you've done. (That said, sometimes it really is necessary to activate this support, but it's more likely to cause problems than to solve them.)\nSecond, the \"boot files... are far from the start of the disk\" message is almost certainly a red herring. This can be a factor with certain disk sizes and certain BIOSes, but you've got an EFI implementation, not a BIOS. An EFI should be able to boot from kernels located anywhere on any disk currently available. Certainly your 1TB disk should pose no problems. Thus, everything you did from that point on was unnecessary at best and problem-producing at worst.\nDespite your activation of legacy support in the firmware, it's conceivable that your system would have booted Windows after you ran Boot Repair. You don't say whether you tried to do so at that point, though, so it's unclear if it would have worked or if you just tried to fix the \"far from the start of the disk\" non-problem without testing it.\nSomewhere along the line you seem to have installed the BIOS (legacy) version of GRUB, which may be what you're booting by default (to get the grub rescue> prompt). It's conceivable that disabling legacy support in your firmware will cause the system to boot straight to Windows or straight to GRUB's EFI-mode installation. If it boots to Windows, you should still be able to get to GRUB by hitting F12. If it boots to GRUB, then you should be able to boot Linux, and possibly Windows. (I recommend trying the first two Windows options. The final three Windows options are unlikely to do anything useful.)\nIf you try this and get GRUB working as the default, you can try using GRUB Customizer to clean up the GRUB menu a bit. I'm not very familiar with this software, though, so I can't be more specific about how to use it.\nAnother thing you could try is to install my rEFInd boot manager. If you install the Debian package and if everything works perfectly, this will give you a menu with options for Windows, for Ubuntu via GRUB, and for Ubuntu directly. You can then remove extra boot entries by deleting unnecessary .efi files in the /boot/efi/EFI directory tree or by editing /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf and uncommenting and adjusting the dont_scan_files or dont_scan_dirs options.\nYou may also want to review your partitions. Your Boot Repair output indicates that you've got four NTFS partitions, and I suspect at least one of those is unwanted/unnecessary, but I can't really be sure of that. You also shouldn't need /dev/sda6 or /dev/sda11 once you've fixed everything.\n\nA: Rod Smith covered most of the issues.\nThe far from start of disk is a red herring. I have yet to see an UEFI system not boot. That was just a check for some BIOS systems that had grub boot issues.\nYou added a boot flag to your new grub partition so it tries to see it as an efi partition. (From Rod Smith I learned you can only have one efi partition per gpt partitioned drive.) Grub does not use boot flags anyway. And only on BIOS with MBR partitioning did you set boot flag on Windows NTFS partition.\nGrub2's os-prober does have a bug and still creates BIOS type boot entries that will not work.\ngrub2's os-prober creates wrong style (BIOS) chain boot entry\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1024383\ntype of entry from Boot-Repair that should work.\nmenuentry \"Windows UEFI bootmgfw.efi\" {\nmenuentry \"Windows Boot UEFI loader\" {\nType of entry that does not work:\n'Windows ...)

The output on the server looked like this:\niperf -s\n------------------------------------------------------------\nServer listening on TCP port 5001\nTCP window size: 85.3 KByte (default)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[  4] local 192.168.1.95 port 5001 connected with 192.168.1.82 port 1309\n[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth\n[  4]  0.0-10.0 sec   416 MBytes   349 Mbits/sec\n------------------------------------------------------------\nClient connecting to 192.168.1.82, TCP port 5001\nTCP window size: 46.1 KByte (default)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[  4] local 192.168.1.95 port 59704 connected with 192.168.1.82 port 5001\n[  4]  0.0-12.2 sec  1.50 MBytes  1.03 Mbits/sec\n\nThe client (My Win 7 PC) produced this output for the same run:\niperf.exe -c 192.168.1.95 -r\n------------------------------------------------------------\nServer listening on TCP port 5001\nTCP window size: 64.0 KByte (default)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nClient connecting to 192.168.1.95, TCP port 5001\nTCP window size: 64.0 KByte (default)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[  4] local 192.168.1.82 port 1309 connected with 192.168.1.95 port 5001\n[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth\n[  4]  0.0-10.0 sec   416 MBytes   349 Mbits/sec\n[  4] local 192.168.1.82 port 5001 connected with 192.168.1.95 port 59704\n[  4]  0.0-12.2 sec  1.50 MBytes  1.03 Mbits/sec\n\nSimilar results are observed from other clients. The computers are all connected to the same Gigabit wired switch.

The spec for Gigabit ethernet requires both sides to use autonegotiate, so make sure that the NIC's on the server and clients are set to auto negotiate, and the same for your switch ports. Setting it to 1000/Full explicitly won't do it.\nI see from one of your outputs:\n\nnegotiated 1000baseT-HD flow-control, link ok\n\nThat looks like half-duplex. What happens when both sides aren't set to auto is that the autonegotiate phase between the two connections correctly detects the 1000mbps speed, but can't discover the duplex mode so it uses the default which is half duplex. So you have 2 devices trying to comunicate, one in full duplex and the other in half duplex. The net result is that the traffic from one side causes a lot of packet errors forcing the packets to be resent and killing the transfer rate in that direction.\nI fixed a problem between a server and a NAS box this way, one card has been set to auto and the other explicitly to 1000/Full.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem on my machine. Download to the machine was a 2MB/s while upload from the machine was only 55kB/s.

So I need several environment to run KVM. And I found my guest machine was not able to run KVM.\nI was using virtualbox 4.2.  \n\nA: KVM requires VT-X/AMD-V, but VirtualBox does not pass VT-X/AMD-V to the guest operating system.\nTherefore, KVM can't run in VirtualBox (yet). Please track bug ticket #4032.\nVT-X and AMD-V (so-called virtualization extensions) run the guest operating system natively in the CPU. Without them, the virtualization software must interpret the operating system opcodes in software, which is very slow.\nFor now, you can either\n\n\n*\n\n*run KVM inside a hypervisor which passes virtualization extensions to the guest (e.g. KVM inside VMware Workstation 8), or\n\n*run another hypervisor inside VirtualBox (e.g. VirtualBox inside VirtualBox).\nThis option will be very slow, because the guest will miss VT-X/AMD-V.\n\n\nA: Enable nested virtualization in KVM in UBUNTU\nBefore enabling nested VT feature, power off all running VMs.\nNext, unload KVM modules.\nTo unload KVM module on INTEL systems, run:\n$ sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel\n\nOn AMD systems:\n$ sudo modprobe -r kvm_amd\n\nReload the KVM module with the nested feature enabled on INTEL CPUs with command:\n$ sudo modprobe kvm_intel nested=1\n\nReload the KVM module with the nested feature enabled on AMD CPUs using command:\n$ sudo modprobe kvm_amd nested=1\n\nEnable nested virtualization permanently\naccording with:\n\n*\n\n*How To Enable Nested Virtualization In KVM In Linux\n\nA: Virtualbox just released (12/18/2018) version 6 in which is expected to have nested virtualization.

I'm about to buy a Dell Precision m6700 that I plan on dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 (or 12.10, feel free to comment) and I'm wondering if I should get the touch screen monitor designed for Windows 8. I'll be working on a plane a lot so the touch screen might be a nice alternative to the track pad when I don't have room for a mouse. I found some people having trouble with it but I'm not sure if it works for most people. Also if you have it working it would be great to know if you find it useful.\nThanks,\nMike\n\nA: Basically, no, in my experience (I have a 2013 XPS 15 w/ touch screen).  There's multiple minor problems that make it unreliable.  First, if you have multiple monitors plugged in, the touches on the screen will go to your \"main\" monitor, even if that isn't your laptop screen (obviously not a problem when you don't have external monitors plugged in).  Even when the touches are on the right screen, they rarely do what you want them to do.  For example, dragging your finger on a webpage selects text on the page, it doesn't scroll the page.\nThis could all be improved in newer versions of the kernel and/or ubuntu updates... but I wouldn't rely on it working.\n\nA: It won't be perfect out of the box, but with some effort you can make it work the way you want.\nTo address the points in Nate Finchs answer, for external non-touch monitors you can use the steps provided here to create two calibrations, one for single and one for dual monitor use.\nInitially you touching the screen will always be interpreted as a click which explains the text being selected. But you can change the behavior greatly by using for example Easystroke.\nyou can find more information on how to configure multitouch gestures here.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Duplicate events in Shotwell I've imported an existing collection of photographs into Shotwell, and it organizes them into different events by date in the UI, and stores them by Year/Month in the filesystem.\nThis is great, just what I want. However, there is a problem. Although the filesystem layout is correct, and without duplicates, there are duplicate events for the same date in the UI:\n\nThis is probably a bug, and as such should be reported somewhere. However, is there someway to easily merge all the duplicate events, either using the Shotwell UI or with a shell script?\n\nA: Shotwell creates new Events with each import, regardless if the photos you are importing could fit into an existing Event.  The thinking is that if you're importing photos from separate cameras (or another source), they may not be of the same \"event\" (i.e. one from a birthday party, another at the zoo or something).  This isn't perfect for everyone, and there is some thought to changing this behavior.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to automatically merge the duplicate Events.  You can, however, manually merge Events by selecting all the photos in one Event and dragging them to a different Event in the sidebar.  If the photos are not taken on the same day, the Event will be renamed to represent that (i.e. \"Thu, Feb 19 - 20, 2011\").\nAlso note that you can Edit -> Undo this operation, which is useful if you make a mistake.  (You lose Undo when you close Shotwell, however.)\n\nA: A better way is to go to the month overview of events, and select 2 events (or more) - there is a 'merge' button at the bottom, so you can combine several events in one go &  the actual merge is faster as well, and the event list doesn't irritatingly scroll up either.\n", "Q: gvfsd-gphoto2 memory leak in Ubuntu 13.04 I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 x64 on my laptop and often (maybe once an hour) it gets so slow and laggy that I can barely move the mouse.

If anyone can give me a hand it would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: You need to first follow this guide How to install and configure Wine? to the letter. Please make sure that after finishing the guide you end up with a 32-Bit WinePrefix. This should leave you with Wine 1.6 which is the most recent one and with a list of components already installed. The winetricks list-installed command in the terminal should look similar to this list:\ncyrex@cyrex:~$ winetricks list-installed\namstream\nd3dcompiler_43\nd3dx10\nd3dx11_42\nd3dx11_43\nd3dx9_26\nd3dx9_28\nd3dx9_31\nd3dx9_35\nd3dx9_36\nd3dx9_39\nd3dx9_42\nd3dx9_43\nd3dx9\ndevenum\ndirac\ndirectmusic\ndirectplay\ndirectx9\ndmsynth\ndotnet20\ndotnet40\ndsound\nffdshow\nicodecs\nl3codecx\nmfc42\nmspatcha\nmsscript\nmsvcirt\nphysx\nquartz\nvcrun2008\nvcrun2010\nvcrun6sp6\nvcrun6\nwinhttp\nwininet\nwsh56vb\nwsh57\nxact_jun2010\nxact\nxinput\nxna40\n\nOf this list, to have Dishonored working, even with all DLC installed, you need to have at least the following components from the list above:\nd3dx11_43\nd3dx9_26\nd3dx9_28\nd3dx9_31\nd3dx9_35\nd3dx9_36\nd3dx9_39\nd3dx9_42\nd3dx9_43\nd3dx9\ndirectmusic\ndirectplay\ndirectx9\ndotnet40\ndsound\nmfc42\nmspatcha\nmsscript\nmsvcirt\nphysx\nquartz\nvcrun2008\nvcrun2010\nvcrun6sp6\nvcrun6\nwinhttp\nwininet\nwsh56vb\nwsh57\nxact_jun2010\nxact\nxinput\nxna40\n\nNow simply run the installer and you should see the following:\n\nStart the installer and when it finishes it is important to check the options that matter:\n\nAfter which you should be able to simply play the game.

The end result should be like this:\n\nHere is a video showing how Dishonored will look: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5u-cxCGG9Y\n\nA: .wine/drive_c is a Linux directory, not a windows directory, hence the error message.  You have to run the installer with wine and point it to a directory within wine, using Windows based filesystem (looks like C:\\ ).\nI don't know much about wine but I have a really advanced setup where I have a \"wine version\" of steam that accesses the steamapps folder in my windows partition, even though steam itself is installed and running on the Linux partition.\nI used playonlinux to get my games running.  It has tons of user friendly features and sets up all the wine dependencies and packages for you when you install a game from their list of known working applications.  You can also install non-listed apps and games manually through playonlinux.\nInstall playonlinux from the Software Centre, and when installing your first game it will take you through a set up wizard that let's you choose what version of wine to use, and some settings to choose regarding the wine directory it makes.  The wine directories for playonlinux are in different locations than with just Wine, so you might as well uninstall old wine to save space.\nI find the most success with running windows games using the 1.5.2 stable release of Wine.  Steam will run on most of the wine versions though, and Steam is a listed application for playonlinux, so it should install perfectly first try.

After a certain point of resizing the player, the video just disappears (though it's still playing audio and will come back if I resize to the small window again).\nI realize my hardware is antiquated, but I am able to play movies in full screen on XBMC (although occasionally my computer freezes and crashes.)  I do disable unity when using XBMC though, perhaps this is the issue I'm facing. \n\nA: There's a few things you can do to optimize your system that might solve this bizarre issue.  \nFirst, check that you have correct drivers for your GPU, if you even have one.  If you're just running integrated graphics, move on to the next step...\nIf your system is legacy you can try running a more lightweight desktop environment.  Unity is not a good GUI for old hardware.  I suggest the lubuntu, xubuntu, or kubuntu desktops.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis will uninstall unity and x. --purge line will remove the old files, to avoid conflict and optimize hard disk usage.  Next, pick which desktop environment to replace it with.\nxubuntu - This is probably what you should try first.  Another lightweight Gnome desktop, but with significantly more features than lubuntu.  Works well on old hardware.\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nlubuntu - Extremely lightweight desktop environment running Gnome.  Works best on PC's with less than 1gb of ram.\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nkubuntu - This is an alternate suggestion because it's a very unique flavor of Ubuntu.  This desktop environment is based off of the Plasma GUI, a powerful feature rich GUI thats light on appearance and similar to Windows in style.  \nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nKubuntu desktop environment really shines when you use the Koffice office suite with it.  Features like drag and drop to bring spreadsheets and graphs and images into word documents that are unavailable on any other desktop environment make it very unique.  Koffice is slightly less compatible with MSOffice formats than libre office though.\nHope this helps.  I can't think of anything else to help you, your problem definitely sounds like a lack of VRAM is causing it.  Also, XBMC runs pretty choppy even on my computer, and I have a next gen system, so you should avoid that software if possible.\n", "Q: How to open shared folder within xp?

Korpela\" for directing me to this site.\nSo if you want to raise your dongers properly on Ubuntu, make sure you have fonts-tibetan-machine installed.\n\nA: The boxes contain the hexadecimal Unicode numbers, and they are a common (and recommended) way of indicating that there is a character that cannot be rendered, because it is not present in the font(s) being used. So this is a font problem.\nIn situations like this, it is often useful to check font information at Fileformat.info. In this case, font support to U+0F3C (one of the characters of the case) appears to be rather limited. In closer look, using other sources to check for additional fonts, the situation appears to be that the following fonts contain it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Arial Unicode MS, a proprietary product shipped with Microsoft Office, also purchaseable separately.\n\n*GNU Unifont, free, but a coarse bitmap font.\n\n*Jomolhari, a free font for Tibetan.\n\n*Windows Himalaya, proprietary, shipped with Windows Vista and newer.\n\n*SunExt-A, a large font of Chinese origin, mentioned to be free.\n\n\nTo see the characters in an editor, you would need to install one of the fonts containing it and instruct the editor to use it, via the editor’s font settings or otherwise.\nTo use them on a web page, you could declare a font-family list that mentions all of those fonts, in preference order. But this would only work for users that have at least one of them installed.

I know that this [closed] question is similar, so I'd like to be more specific:\nUsing Ubuntu Phone, what data will be stored \"in the cloud\"? Namely\n\n\n*\n\n*Contacts\n\n*Calendar\n\n*Call history\n\n*Email?\n\n\nWill I need to get an Ubuntu One account to be able to use Ubuntu Phone (as I need a Google account for Android)?\nCan Ubuntu Phone be configured such that it's sync behaviour is like for the old Windows Mobile series, i.e. sync between laptop/phone only via USB, avoiding the cloud completely and working even without an internet connection?\nIt seems like even an open source OS like Android are quite hard to set up such that your personal data doesn't \"rush off\" to Google accidentally, so I am wondering where Ubuntu mobile OS stands with regards to control over your data. I noticed that the Ubuntu Tablet site states the following:\n\nUbuntu One already has millions of users on Ubuntu, Android, Windows\n  and Mac. Deeply integrated on Ubuntu devices, it provides free\n  storage, paid-for music streaming services and a foundation for\n  cloud-based services from operators and device makers.\n\n...which doesn't clearly define what can or has to be shared and how easy it is to turn it off. I couldn't find anything about Ubuntu Phone on that matter.\nI also just found this question on Reddit about the Ubuntu Edge phone, and the following answer:\n\nWe're entering a really interesting phase where in a sense our very own\n  tools spy on us.\nWe will certainly have an easier time providing transparency on the\n  origin of the code in the platform than, say, your average android\n  device, where it's all a big hacky mush. The core OS which will be\n  updated regularly on the Ubuntu phones is all traceable directly back\n  to standard Ubuntu source and binary packages.\nThere will be a core piece on each phone which handles the hardware,\n  consisting of kernel and drivers and firmware and interfaces to things\n  like the radio. That's where unhealthy things could creep in from\n  manufacturers and carriers. We can offer... constructive guidance\n  there.\n\nUnfortunately again no details about the control over your data, unless it will be totally app-specific what data will be shared... but I guess there will be a stock set of contacts, phone, email and appointments apps, right?\n\nA: I was under the impression it didn't store any of that automatically in the cloud, because those cloud services are all optional based on the use of either an Ubuntu One account, Gmail, MSexchange, etc.\nAll those things must be manually set up using applications such as thunderbird, or evolution mail, and if you don't set them up using cloud software, then they won't end up in the cloud.  Simple right?\nYour call history won't be shared by Ubuntu, but it will be by your cell phone carrier.  There's no way out of that one I think....\nAndroid may be linux based, but it is built by Google, the information giant.  Don't compare it's privacy policies to the rest of the linux distributions.  Canonical is not interested in collecting \"big data\".\nUbuntu One is a software application installed by default on Ubuntu OS.  It is an optional software that offers very good integration with Ubuntu.  Google \"Ubuntu One privacy policy\" for more information about their privacy policies.  \nCanonical preaches about convergence of the OS.  You are running the same OS on your phone, as you do on PC; with the only difference being the processor that the OS is aimed towards, and a few extra software packages focused on the GUI and user experience.\nAt this time, the only information Ubuntu applications that are installed by default, which share information, is Unity.  It sends search terms from the Dash to amazon (and a few others like Facebook I believe) so you can pull search results for amazon store products and facebook images with matching filenames.  This option is enabled by default and can be disabled easily, after you do a quick google search for \"privacy settings in Unity desktop\".\n\"can you set up syncing via usb only and avoid cloud / internet?\"  Canonical announced that the device will sync up via mass storage mode with any computer.  It doesn't \"sync\" like MTP devices do, and instead offers only the classic drag n' drop file management support.  I am sure there will be other applications down the road to enable MTP and other sync methods with Ubuntu OS.\nAll of the former statements are in regards to Ubuntu OS for phones.  If you're planning on purchasing an Ubuntu Edge device, keep in mind that the Ubuntu Edge dual boots android, with FULL integration with your Ubuntu information.  Pictures, contacts, emails, calendar, etc... are all shared with both OS.  You will have to wrestle with android again to get your privacy settings the way you like, or it'll share all your Ubuntu info anyways.\n", "Q: Use NotifyOSD with i3wm window manager I use i3wm as window manager, but something seems to be broken.

Fish around in the advanced and power settings and look for items with \"AC\" in the title. Here's a Tom's Hardware Article on the power settings which includes such an option, called \"AC Power Loss Restart\" here... But the exact name does vary.\nIf you can't find or don't have a setting like that your alternative is better but more expensive: a UPS. Essentially a big 12V battery that you plug your computer in to. It'll handle surges and should keep the computer running for a period of time (determined by the size of the battery). Getting the battery size correct is important (too much load on a small battery can fry the UPS) but 1000VA is a good start for the average destkop.\nI don't think there's a pure-software solution to this. My next alternative involved a Lego Mindstorm robot that presses your power (and then Escape) button on a schedule... But now we're getting weird.\n", "Q: VPN Autoconnect Im using Ubuntu 13.04 with Gnome and I recently set up a (open)VPN. Is there any way to enable it by default? Each time I boot or even lost my connection, I have to enable the VPN manually. Is there an option I am missing?\n\nA: Take a look at vpnautoconnect.\n\nvpnautoconnect is a daemon that allow you to reconnect automatically\n  (at startup too) a vpn create with network manager.It can reconnect\n  very quickly and monitor the bandwith, It works with pptp and openvpn\n  connection.\n\nFor more info, and to download visit the Website.\nTry This as well:\nuse the AUTOSTART feature in /etc/default/openvpn\nOr\nFigure out the UUID of your VPN connection. \nnmcli con list | grep -i vpn\n\nThe UUID is the second column with the letters, numbers and dashes. \nStart the connection in a terminal. Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nnmcli con up uuid <put you UUID here>\n\nSet this to run at start-up. \nGo to Dash, type and choose Startup Applications, click Add, and add the nmcli command above (with the UUID). Click \"Add\".  In the name type what ever name you want to use, and in Command put the whole nmcli line above. Click \"Add\" again. Now, reboot and try it. \nSource:SourceForge\n\nA: Through the Network Manager indicator nm-applet (the GNOME or Unity network tray applet installed by default), you can configure NetworkManager to automatically connect to a VPN when a network is connected.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the network tray applet and click \"Edit connections...\", or run nm-connection-editor.\n\n*Select a network connection and click \"Edit...\"\n\n*Check \"Automatically connect to VPN when using this connection\" and select the desired VPN in the drop-down list.\n\n*Save.\n\n\n\n\nWhen this is enabled, there is a bug in NetworkManager that can break the \"automatically connect to this network\" function. (Edit: this bug has now been marked as \"fix released\" in Ubuntu 16.04). If NetworkManager tries to automatically connect and fails, you will see a line like the following in /var/log/syslog:\n<error> [1401130450.367538] [nm-vpn-connection.c:1374] get_secrets_cb(): Failed to request VPN secrets #2: (6) No agents were available for this request.\n\nIt seems that NetworkManager fails to obtain the user's VPN password from gnome-keyring-daemon. One workaround is to let NetworkManager store the password in plaintext in the configuration file in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal.\n\n*sudoedit /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<VPN>, where <VPN> is the configuration file for your VPN (the filename is usually the name you assigned to your VPN).\n\n*Change the line password-flags=1 to password-flags=0\n\n*Save and exit.\n\n\nNetworkManager will now store the VPN password itself (see man nm-settings for details), and the network autoconnect will work once again.\n\nA: I would recommend checking out the script in this article:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# YourVPN here is the name of desired vpn connection to monitor\n# edit this line:\n##################\nVPNNAME=YourVPNUUID\n# enter desired time between checks here (in seconds)\nSLEEPTIME=15\n##################\n\nnice=0\n\nfor (( ; ; )); do\n\n# creating infinite loop\n\ntested=$(nmcli con status uuid $VPNNAME | grep -c UUID)\n#possible results:\n# 0 - no connection - need to start\n# 1 - working connection, continue.\n\ncase $tested in\n\"0\")\necho \"Not connected - starting\"\n\n#increase nice counter\nnice=$[nice+1]\n\n#if \"nice start\" fails for 3 times\nif [ $nice -ge 3 ];\nthen\n#TRY to knock hard way, resetting the network-manager (sometimes it happens in my kubuntu 12.04).\n      echo \"HARD RESTART!\"\n      nmcli nm enable false\n      nmcli nm enable true\n      sleep 5\n      nmcli con up uuid $VPNNAME\n      nice=0\nelse\n#not yet 3 falures - try starting normal way\n      echo \"trying to enable.\"\n      nmcli con up uuid $VPNNAME\nfi\n\n;;\n\n\"1\")\necho \"VPN seems to work\" \n\n;;\nesac\n\nsleep $SLEEPTIME\n\ndone\n\nTo find out the value of YourVPNUUID for $VPNNAME simply run the following;\nnmcli con list | grep -i vpn\n\n\nA: vpnautoconnect did not work for me in 12.04 LTS, and I dont seem to be the only one.\nI researched it a bit and combined some existing code to make my first bash script.

(You may have to store the file somewhere else and/or alter the read/write/execture permissions as well if your computer has multiple users.)\n\n*Copy the code from above to the file you created. Replace the values of the following three variables:\nconnection=\"Auto Ethernet\"\nvpn_connection=\"My VPN connection\"\nrun_interval=\"60\"\nThey can be found by opening the network manager. In my case connection=\"Auto Ethernet\" is my active wired connection (haven't tested with wireless) and vpn_connection=\"My VPN connection\" is the name of my VPN connection. run_interval=\"60\" is the time interval in seconds for when to repeat the script.\n\n*Open Applications->System Tools->Preferences->Startup Applications. Add a suitable name, e.g. \"VPN Auto Connector\", and for the command choose the .sh file you saved earlier. Now the bash script will run at startup and will keep checking if the VPN connection is active.

If there are any options please tell. Thanks\n\nA: One option is to move your /home to another drive.  Just make sure that you enough room on the new drive, and then check out Partitioning/Home/Moving.\nNote: when dealing with partitions, and drives, make sure that you have a current backup just in case.\n\nA: I recommend you use GParted to resize your partitions. \nWith Gparted you can shrink your Windows partition, Move your Ubuntu Partition to the left, and then resize it to make it fill in the extra space on the right.\nI don't know of any other partition manager that can do this.  \nI also highly suggest you burn Gparted to a bootable disc, or bootable USB.  Gparted only works in a linux environment; and since you'll be moving the information on every hard drive stripe when you move your Ubuntu partition to the left, it would be safest not to run Gparted from that partition.\n", "Q: How to replace win 7 and keep files without backing them up completely new to ubuntu, just learned about it a day ago and needed a free OS so decided to check it out.\nI previously had windows 7 installed on my hdd with two partitions. Windows and essentials for C (30gb) and games/music/movies for D (900gb).\nMy windows stopped working (FAILED TO LOAD FROM BOOT DISK) so I decided to switch over.\nI loaded up 13.04 unto a USB and installed it while formatting C and win7 loader to ext3. Didn't unmount everything because I can't back up 900gb of files.\nNow when I load my hdd from the boot menu, all I get is a 'Missing Operating System' message.\nIs there ANY way to delete windows 7 completely to use ubuntu exclusively, and keep my files without buying another hdd???\n\nA: Answer: \nYes\nExplanation: \nUbuntu is capable of accessing files in the NTFS file system (windows file system).  Anything you have stored on the D:\\ drive is accessible from Ubuntu.  \nTo remove windows and install Ubuntu, simply insert the live cd installer, and when given the option to select which hard drive to install to, click the little button that says something like \"manually manage partitions\".  From there you can delete your partition on your old C:\\ and select the empty space for your Ubuntu installation.\nYour only restriction will be that you cannot install Ubuntu software on the second, NTFS partition (D:\\ in windows, but will not be named the same in Ubuntu.  See the bonus note below).  This can be worked around by using an application called Gparted.  It's a partition manager application that can run from a bootable cd or usb in a custom linux environment designed only to run Gparted.  That's the safest way to use the app.  Since it does a lot of powerful things, and you can break things if you do something wrong, you should research the program a bit before using it.  Gparted is the best partitioning software as far as utility goes.  I won't go into detail about that here though.\nBONUS NOTE:  A little information about Ubuntu file system, since you're a new user:\nLinux in general uses a more powerful filesystem than Windows.  Files are written to the HDD differently too.  Files are written to fill up every HDD stripe before moving on to the next, to optimize space, and they start from the beginning of the stripe.  Windows starts anywhere between the beginning and the middle, and only writes one encoding on each stripe, it won't start the next coding in stripe X and finish it in stripe Y.  \nLinux also doesn't use drive letters to define partitions.  Each partition has a descriptive name, an arbitrary title, and is mounted in one grand filesystem defined simply \"/\" meaning the root.  Notice the use of forward slash in linux, vs C:\\ backslash in Windows.  \nLinux also stores the files differently.  When you move a file from one folder to another in Windows, it literally takes the data, and moves it somewhere else on the hard drive.  Linux maps every file to their respective locations, so when you move files from one folder to another (on the same HDD) the transfer is almost instantaneous since it only changes the digital location, not the file's physical location.\n", "Q: how to receive email notification for linux server memory utilization I have a critical webserevr running on Ubuntu. I need to receive email notification whenever server CPU utilization and memory utilization goes above a threshold.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Take a pick:\n\n*\n\n*Nagios\n\nThis is one of the most popular web based Linux monitoring systems nowadays, actually it’s industry standard for IT infrastructure monitoring. Licensed under GPL Nagios is available for everybody free of charge and allows to monitor availability and response time of network services, usage of system resources like CPU load, RAM allocation etc., number of logged in users and many-many more. It doesn’t makes sense to list here everything that can be monitored by Nagios but its nature implies that main Nagios instance (server) collects information from either local system or Nagios clients (agents). It means you can install client software on number of Linux, BSD, Windows hosts or Cisco devices, point them to Nagios server and see states of their services or processes in one place: Nagios web based monitoring tool (see the screenshot below).\nIn case of any outage detected by Nagios server or any anomaly you will get an alert from Nagios. It’s important that Nagios suports wide range of alerts including e-mail, sms, chat messages and phone call notifications. Large number of official and third party plugins can extend Nagios’ functionality dramatically.\n\n\n*\n\n*Zabbbix\n\nZabbix is enterprise class Linux monitoring system with impressive list of capabilities available out of the box. It is licensed under GPL and is written in PHP. In brief Zabbix can do the same tasks as Nagios and Cacti by default: Zabbix easily graphs monitored data and sends alerts to user in case of any problem. Using Zabbix you can create maps of the hosts, group hosts by various categories and so on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Cacti. For mail it requires thold.\n\n\nCacti is another web based monitoring system written in PHP and licensed under GPL. Unlike Nagios describe above Cacti was designed mainly fo the graphs — in brief, Cacti polls various services and then graphs resulting data. It uses RRDTool to build graphs so if you can some graphs in .rrd files you can easily attach them to Cacti and have everything in one place.\nSo you can see CPU load graphs, RAM usage, round trip time stats, bandwidth utilization and much more information collected from various hosts. As well as Nagios Cacti supports SNMP that makes it possible to monitor almost any device in your network: Linux hosts, *BSD hosts, Windows hosts, Cisco devices, Juniper equipment, voip phones, routers, switches whatever.\nMeantime by default Cacti doesn’t provides alerts so you should install third party plugin (thold or others) for that or use more flexible solutions supporting alerts (like Nagios or Zabbix).\n\nSource.\n", "Q: Glade, quickly and changing an image with code I have created the default ubuntu-application template using quickly and I'm trying to work out how to change the displayed image through code.\nThe default image shows an ubuntu logo with the path \".../media/background.png\" within glade.\nIf I open the projects window python file (testWindow.py as the projects name is test) and add the following lines at the base of the finish_initializing function  (changing nothing else within the default files created),\nself.PNG = self.builder.get_object(\"image1\")\nself.PNG.set_from_file(\"../media/background.png\")\n\nThe program runs but instead of the ubuntu logo, the small missing file icon displays. However no error message displays in the terminal and changing the png file to another png, or moving it to the same directory as the python file (changing the second lines file to \"background.png\") gives the same issue.\nI can use the clear() function to remove the image successfully but I'm clearly doing something wrong and I can't seem to make any headway into the documentation for the image widget.\nIn case it helps to know what I'm aiming to do, I'm trying to create a simple flashcard program, displaying a Japanese character and requiring the user to input the correct pronunciation and displaying another image of a new character if the user is successful.\nThank you for any help you can give!\n\nA: The path you're giving set_from_file is relative to the glade file but not the python file. It's better to use full paths anyways as using relative paths often ends up having issues when you run the installed application. Quickly provides a nice helper function to give you the full path for a file found in the data/ folder. Try:\nfrom test_lib.testconfig import get_data_file\n\n[....]   \n\n    self.image = self.builder.get_object(\"image1\")\n    self.background = get_data_file(\"media/background.png\")\n    self.image.set_from_file(self.background)\n\n", "Q: Distributing your software professionally in Ubuntu? I have made a .deb package which I have hosted on an Apache server. People can do apt-get install from my repository.\nWhen people do \"apt-get install mypackage\". They get an unauthorized warning.\nTo solve the warning I signed the package with gpg and generated the public key. My client then add the public key from an url after which they don't get the warning.\nNow what I want is that my client should not get warning without going into trouble of downloading public key and then adding it to apt-keys. Like any other famous software packages.\n\nA: If you're doing this for one-off packages for one-off clients, doing it the way you're doing sounds about right. They'll need to add the key, add the repo, update and then install. Bit of a long route but it can be boiled into a few commands. You could also distribute a script does the above for the user but even then you need to instruct them to chmod/run it.\nIf you're intending this for mass distribution (same package for lots of people) and want it to go on general sale, talk to Canonical. They have partner repos and private repos for software on sale. They'll want a cut though. You can read more about it on the developer FAQ and then just sign into the developer site to get started.\n", "Q: Focus or open window in gnome on keyboard shortcut As described here (askubuntu.com/questions/234206/shortcut-to-switch-to-app/328842) the wmctrl gives you access to your windows. So you can switch via keyboard. But I like to have one shortcut to open and focus if it is yet open.\nIs there a tool for that?\n\nA: Yet another solution.   \nMake sure you have wmctrl installed: sudo apt install wmctrl \nMake a shortcut with the command: bash -c \"wmctrl -a chrome ; [ \"$?\" == \"1\" ] && google-chrome\" \nExplanation: first we try to focus on chrome (wmctrl -vxa chrome), next we verify if we are successful \"$?\" == \"0\" or not \"$?\" == \"1\" and if not we then launch google chrome ([ \"$?\" == \"1\" ] && google-chrome\").\nYou also could make the shortcut bash -c \"wmctrl -a chrome || google-chrome\" \n|| means that if the first command fails, execute the second. \n\nA: I have the following directly as a keyboard shortcut:\n#                Focus Chrome if it's running,           start it otherwise.\nsh -c \"if test $(wmctrl -vxa chrome 2>&1 | wc -l) -eq 1; then google-chrome; fi\"\n\n\nA: Try these instructions (tested):\n\n\n*\n\n*First get WM_CLASS name of app xprop | grep WM_CLASS\n\n*Then make shortcut bash -c \"wmctrl -xa <WM_CLASS> || <WM_CLASS>\"\n\n*For example: bash -c \"wmctrl -xa google-chrome || google-chrome\n\nA: *\n\n*make sure wmctrl is installed:\n\nsudo apt install wmctrl\n\n\n*open the gnome Settings, then Keyboard Shortcuts. add this command:\n\nbash -c \"wmctrl -a firefox || firefox\"\nExplanation:\nwmctrl tries to open the window if it was open already. In this case the next command won't execute. But if the window was not already open the next command would execute and run the program/script you want (e.g. firefox).\nPS:\nThis is the definition of || operator.\n\nA: Got it almost.\nCreated /usr/local/bin/go (sudo vim /usr/local/bin/go) with these lines:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif wmctrl -l | grep -i --quiet \"${1}\"; then\n    wmctrl -a ${1}\nelse\n    ${1}\nfi\n\nMade it executable: sudo chmod ugo+x /usr/local/bin/go\nAnd added some shortcuts to the system:\nName: Firefox\nCommand: go firefox\nvia Super+F\nBut firefox doesn't show up. Via console it act like it should.\n\nA: I used OlivierBlanvillain's approach but modified for a specific outcome:\nI wanted F12 to toggle between Chrome or my Terminal, depending on what was focused.

Just spent a couple of days overcoming all sorts of minor problems and performing tweaks and downloading apps etc.. Having installing 12.04 (32 bit) onto an old Xp machine leaving windows in a separate partition for optional booting. Basically very impressed with everything. However have just hit a brick wall, there does not seem to be a simple way of enabling other users of the same computer accessing each others' files. \nEven the music files only seem to be available to the user that downloaded them. \nSurely Ubuntu does not require that each user has a complete duplicate copy of the music library. And how do two users have access to a commonly used file that they mutually update. \nWhat am I missing....?\n\nA: To just access the files of another user, you should find them in /home/\"username\".\nNavigate there with a terminal using cd /home/\"username\" and type ls -l. You should get a list of all the folders and files. There you can see all the permissions for owners and users (lookup ls in ubuntuusers). Here you can see if permissions are the problems. You can change the permissions with chmod (lookup chmod in ubuntuusers). \nIf you also want cross-platform access (from XP to Ubuntu and vice versa) and I think it is not a bad idea to keep data, you want to use from several accounts, not in /home/\"user\"/.., I would make a separate NTFS- Partition (only if windows access is necessary otherwise you can use ext).

I am going to install Ubuntu 13.04-x64 on my PC. Currently, I have two hard disk partitions as \"C\" on which I have my windows 8 installed and \"D\" which contain all my personal files. I having no problem formating or erasing \"C\" since I am not going to switch back to Windows.\nThe weired thing happened after I installed Ubuntu on \"C\" that I can not see the other partition \"D\" in Ubuntu system. Thanks god that I forced to switch back to windows to check the other partition and still not touched as I was aware that it might be removed during installation of Ubuntu.\nI need a tip to install Ubuntu and exploring both Partitions inside like as it in windows. Any help guys ?\nFor note that I am going to install Ubuntu from a DVD ;)\n\nA: open terminal\nCtrl+Alt+T\nUse the command below to launch fdisk (as root user), a partition mount managing utility installed in Ubuntu by default.  This application can also be found in the Ubuntu Dash, I believe it's just called \"Disks\" or something like that.\nsudo fdisk\nSelect the associated HDD, then the associated partition (which is not labelled \"D\" in Linux, because Linux doesn't use that naming convention).  Right click it for a list of options, including the ability to set automount parameters either automatically, or manually.  You can control the name of the partition in Linux, reformat/delete partitions, the mount location, mount options, etc.\nGoogle search \"How the Linux filesystem works\" to find more information about the Linux file system.  I highly suggest it.\nHow the Linux File System Works; breif summary\nThere are layers of software that mount filesystems.  Partitions are just digitally divided filesystems, allowing a computer to detect it as more than one device, but Linux can do all that and it can do it with any file system that can ever be created.  You can mount any partition in any format, and it will always successfully read the data.  Then it mounts it inside another filesystem.  One giant filesystem starting with / is the mapping strategy that Linux uses for all digital data, and it flawlessly mounts any hard drive format to it.  \nExceptions, more like technicalities, would only include certain communication formats such as MTP, which I don't know much about, but it makes some very weird changes to filesystem management, and a second communication program has to be designed for it.\nTLDR;\nYour D:\\ partition should be detectable by Linux automatically.  If it is not you should find out why, and use partition managing software and find the partition.  Use an application called disks if you search the unity dash for it, or fdisk if you run it from the terminal.  If this application shows an NTFS filesystem of the same size as your D:\\ used to be, then just right click it, change the properties so that it automounts on boot.  It's really easy software, I can't write a guide for using it for you thats too much haha.  Go google it, if you still need help, there are many articles and videos out there about running powerful partition managers like fdisk on Ubuntu.  There is also existing support articles written about what to do if Linux isn't detecting a partition, and you should read some. \n", "Q: Why doesn't my system use hardware rendering?

So no problems there too. The problem is that I don't see the USB in the BOOT menu, but I see the same USB in the boot menu of my WinXP. So there is some problem in my BIOS which is not able to detect my USB as a bootable device. Here I am at loss as what could be the problem?\n\nA: Try these:\nChange UEFI to legacy boot support in the BIOS setup\ninstall ubuntu in USB drive using a software instead of manually from CMD or terminal. \n\nA: If your new computer came pre-installed with Windows 8, there are a few BIOS level settings that prevent you from booting off your USB device or any other media (CD/DVD) other then your Windows 8 install, all by default.\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure Boot: [Enabled] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Secure_boot)\n\n*OS Mode Selection: [UEFI OS] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Compatibility_Support_Module)\n\n\nI Disabled Secure Boot and for (2) look for \"CSM\" or \"Legacy\" Boot support.\n\nA: Check that your firmware has not reloaded defaults. Making sure usb is selected as bootable device in boot device order/priority settings. Never flash your firmware if there is no obvious reason to. If windows boots and works as expected (try mounting usb drive in windows to make sure system can see it) then you probably have no need to flash firmware. It is safer to flash firmware out with Windows or how manufacturer describes at their website. \nMethodically go through all firmware settings to make sure all hardware settings are appropriately configured.\nIt may be that Grub can not use the efi image that is on your usb due to how your hardware implements UEFI specification. Which means if you do get usb to boot the legacy/bios installer will run. Which would then mean you have to run boot-repair in order to install grub-efi and possibly make other changes to the legacy install to make it use uefi to boot. \nCan you remember seeing a black background with grub options to install or try Ubuntu when you did get usb to boot? \nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Identifying_if_the_computer_boots_the_Ubuntu_DVD_in_EFI_mode to see an easy way to identify if Ubuntu usb has booted using uefi or legacy mode from installation media.\nSome firmwares only recognise DVD media with efi files.  Try burning and booting a DVD using UEFI settings.\nThe usb flash drive you are using could be being detected by firmware as a hard drive.

It was not a really fresh install: I keep my /home in a separate partition, so /root and /swap are the fresh ones. The only fresh install was Lubuntu 11.10 sometime ago.\nThe file .gtk-bookmarks at my /home folder seems to be updated correctly from what I checked. So every bookmark changed on PCManFM is changed on that file.\nMore info: If I open Leafpad (it could be any other application except PCManFM), menu File>Open> and from that window I bookmark another folder, that folder won't be available  on Bookmarks at PCManFM but it will be available as a bookmarked folder on the other applications (Leafpad, Chromium and so on). Finally, when modifying PCManFM bookmarks from this window, the file .gtk-bookmarks at my /home folder will not be updated as expected, confirming the modification is not acknowledged by PCManFM but acknowledged by the other applications.\nMore info 2: besides the file .gtk-bookmarks at my /home folder, I noticed there's a file called bookmarks at /home/username/.config/gtk-3.0.

I can't imagine that would be the case, but would it disturb the look up time on disk for the files in that directory?\nI am a beginner so I'm sorry if this question doesn't really make sense. \n\nA: cp copies files.  If you specify a directory (I've never tested this) it would probably copy the contents of this directory, and place them all (including the original folder) into the destination directory.  Yes, it will create two copies of the target file(s) and yes, it will probably disturb a number of things like that.\nYou can drag and drop files easily in Nautilus to move them naturally, without the negative effects on hard drive optimization.  The mv command in terminal will do the same thing.  It's similar in usability to the cp command:  \nmv </oldlocation/target> </newlocation/destination/>\n\nWhere the target is a file, or a directory, and the destination is a directory.\nNOTE:  If you use mv </location/filenameA> <location/filenameB> it will rename the file.\nFor example, \nmv /etc/x11/xorg.conf /etc/x11/xorg.conf.backup\n\nwill rename the xorg.conf text file to xorg.conf.backup.  Try doing a google search of useful linux command line tools.\nAnother neat trick in command line is using the 'man' option.  For example\nmv man\n\nor\nsudo man\n\nThe 'man' stands for manual.  Every terminal application has a manual detailing the nature of the application, all of it's options, and definitions for everything.  You can run the man option with any terminal command you install.\n\nA: The move command in linux is mv, see mv --help for more info\nthis moves the directory and all sub dirs\nmv -f dir1 /destinationDir\n\nThis move files from dir1 to dir2\nmv -f dir1/* dir2\n\n\nA: Adding an answer because this was my first search result in Google and there wasn't many thorough answers on the mv command, and what linking means at any level of detail.\ncp - copies. It will make an identical copy by default, taking up identical space, although you can tell cp to make hard links (pointers to each file) using the -l option.\nIf you want to create a copy of a folder, do this:\ncp -a source dest\n\nWhere -a means an \"archive\" or identical copy, including folders and links.  You could exchange it for -r if you want to copy folders but not links.\nIf you want to create a copy with links to the original files (changing the original changes the copy as well, and takes up much less space), do this:\ncp -l source dest\n\nln - links. It will make only a link, you can have it point to your destination, and it will only take up the space it takes to point to it.\nIf you want to create a single link to a folder, just do this:\nln -s source dest\n\nNOTE:  -s means \"symbolic\" link. Because ln can create hard or soft (most people call this \"symbolic\") links.  Hard links can only point to files and have other restrictions, while symbolic links can point to anything, including folders.  For a complete article on differences between hard and soft links see this great article here.\nmv - moves files or folders.\nTo move folders (or files) just do this:\nmv source dest\n\n", "Q: Install ubuntu 12.04 on macbook air 6.2: refit resync partitions I'm trying to set up a MacBook Air 6,2 to dual boot OSX and Ubuntu 12.04.\nI've been following these instructions:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation\nI'm using refit instead of refind because I saw some reports that refind wasn't working properly with MacBook Airs (and that refit worked fine).\nI've gotten to the point of needing to resync the partition tables in refit. When I run the partition tool I see this:\nhttp://i44.tinypic.com/2crq4vo.jpg\nIs this what it's supposed to look like?\nI'm concerned that in my current GPT table the partition I formatted as EXT4 and set to mount at / is showing up as \"basic data\" and that in the \"Proposed new MBR partition table\" there is no linux. If this is not as it should be what might be the problem and how might I fix it?\nThanks!\n\nA: \"Syncing\" partition tables is creating a hybrid MBR. Unfortunately, hybrid MBRs are ugly and dangerous. In your installation, they're also probably unnecessary -- if you boot Linux in EFI mode rather than in BIOS mode. Unfortunately, the last time I checked, Ubuntu favored BIOS-mode installations on Macs, but you can reconfigure the computer to boot Linux in EFI mode. Thus, I recommend you consider this option rather than use a BIOS-mode installation.\nIf you go ahead with a BIOS-mode installation, you may want to create a BIOS Boot Partition on the disk and then use either gdisk or the version of gptsync that comes with rEFInd to prepare your hybrid MBR. gdisk gives much better control than either version of gptsync over hybrid MBR creation, and rEFInd's gptsync is smarter about what partitions get included than is rEFIt's gptsync.\nAs to rEFInd and MacBook Airs, I'm rEFInd's maintainer, and I've received reports both ways on this score. (Unfortunately, I don't have one of the affected computers, which makes it very hard for me to fix the problem.) You might try preparing a USB flash drive image with rEFInd and test with it. If rEFInd works fine that way, then you should be fine with a regular hard disk installation. If it fails, try removing unnecessary drivers (from the EFI/BOOT/drivers_x64 directory on the flash drive) and try again.\n", "Q: Are wireless card interchangeable? can I mount a BCM4313 on a notebook that originally mounted a rt3290?

Xubuntu 12.04 is a Long Term Support release (LTS) that is supported by updates until April, 2015 (Update: the latest LTS release is 14.04). Lubuntu is also an option, but it does not yet have Long Term Support. However Lubuntu 14.04 will be an LTS release which will be supported by updates for three years until April, 2017.\n\nA: Yes, it is, but I would recommend you to choose lightweight window managers like lxde, openbox, xfce instead of gnome/kde/unity.\n\nA: Looking at your specs you may not experience performance issues as in Ubuntu's official site states that; A good \"rule of thumb\" is that machines that could run XP, Vista, Windows 7 or x86 OS X will almost always be a lot faster with Ubuntu even if they are lower-spec than described in Recommended Minimum System Requirements. \nSimply try Ubuntu CD as a LiveCD first to check the hardware works. In such case, I would recommend you to have a look at Ubuntu's official documentation about various distribution and its useful information.\n\nA: As my personal experience Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is heavier than windows XP. If you are having extremely slow conditions under XP then Ubuntu 12.04 would not be a good choice given that your computer configuration is also not quite sufficient for Ubuntu 12.04 specially the RAM;\nAs others said go for light versions like Lubuntu or Xubuntu;\n\nA: 12.04 may run well in 2D mode (you can choose it at log in).  I found that Ubuntu in 2D mode takes about the same amount of resources than Xubuntu, so try 2D first.  If that doesn't run fast enough then Lubuntu is a good choice for the amount of RAM you have installed.\nI expect your WinXP installation is running slow due to fragmentation issues, or various mal-ware finding it's way on your system.

(Or, to install using the command line, simply type sudo apt-get install gnome-media in a terminal window).  This program will let you record sound snippets and play them back.  After installing, search for \"Sound Recorder\" in the Unity Dash to launch it.\nTo control or set your audio inputs and outputs, you can install \"PulseAudio Volume Control\" from the Ubuntu Software Center.  (Or, to install using the command line, simply type sudo apt-get install pavucontrol in a terminal window).  This program will let you configure or select Playback, Recording, Output Devices, or Input Devices.  After installing, search for \"PulseAudio Volume Control\" in the Unity Dash to launch it.\nIn \"PulseAudio Volume Control,\" if you navigate to the Input Devices tab, you can tap on your microphone and see the volume meeter jump.  If the volume meter does not jump, set the correct microphone from the Port drop-down on this tab.\nFinally you can also run \"PulseAudio Volume Meter (Capture)\" from the Unity Dash as you record something (or use your microphone) to see a simple microphone volume meter as you speak.  Note that two programs, \"PulseAudio Volume Meter (Capture)\" and \"PulseAudio Volume Meter (Playback)\" are also installed automatically along with \"PulseAudio Volume Control.\"\n", "Q: What are some Ubuntu projects to contribute?

I tried various ways of installed Tkinter/Tk, but they didn't work, so I thought I should uninstall it and reinstall it. In the terminal, this was my command: sudo apt-get remove python2.7.

I think I understand the risks of a weak but memorable password and am willing to take the associated risks. Why does Ubuntu want me to use 4Kl0Ijm7NNtvD4502Kq for a password? Then will not allow me to control and use my machine as I see fit? \nThis is why I want to use Linux- so I can use it my way. I have to reinstall Ubuntu because I wanted to change my password and use a simple easy to remember password. \nI am really inconvenienced.\n\nA: An installation of Ubuntu requires a minimum password length of 8 characters.  (This was changed a few years ago, but I think they kept the installer with a shorter password length to make it easier to setup a user during installation).\nNevertheless, it is very easy to change the default password length...\nWith superuser or root privileges, you need to edit a file called /etc/pam.d/common-password.\nGUI Method\nIn the Unity dash, search for and launch \"Terminal.\"  In the terminal, type sudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-password.  Enter your password, and a text editor will appear.  Find the line that says \"pam_unix.so obscure sha512\", add a single space at the end of this line, and type \"min=6\" (without the quotes).  Then save your file and exit the text editor.  (This will allow you to use passwords that are 6 characters long.  Of course, you could use a different password length number for \"min=\", if you like).\nSimple Command Line Method\nTo make this easy, you can do all of this automatically by typing the following two lines into your terminal.  In the Unity dash, search for and launch \"Terminal.\"  In the terminal, type (and enter your password when prompted):\nsudo cp -v /etc/pam.d/common-password /etc/pam.d/common-password.original\n\nsudo sed -i \"s|pam_unix.so obscure sha512|pam_unix.so min=6 sha512|g\" /etc/pam.d/common-password\n\n(Note that the first line above simply makes a copy of your original common-password file, so you can revert to it if you need to).\nA bit off topic, but regarding your other point about convenience, I find there are many, many conveniences with Linux, but there are always some things that do no come pre-configured \"your way\" out-of-the-box.  For example, someone running a business with secure data may appreciate the longer password length restriction.\nI also find that if something is not convenient for you out-of-the-box, then it can be easily changed to your liking.

(I will test this myself when I get a Galaxy Nexus using CDMA code named toro)\nSecond: updates from terminal\nI have found that currently there is a way to updating without reflashing. On the wikipedia page for Ubuntu Touch, there is a field labeled Update method which reads \"Click Update Manager, Image Based Updates\" and I have found that others say command line works just as well.\nThird: sdcard\nYou must understand that the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4 are two different devices. Neither of which have an SD card slot.\nFourth: python3\nThe Ubuntu Touch operating system is a full operating system with a codebase similar to Ubuntu which means the Debian APT system is implemented, yet it is not identical as it does not use Xorg and runs on an ARM processor. These facts as well as the launchpad page for python3 show that it is available on the mobile operating system.\nFifth: mako\nThe Nexus 4 code named mako only shipped with GSM compatibility. The Galaxy Nexus is sold for both GSM and CDMA. The Galaxy Nexus for CDMA was code named toro for Verizon and toroplus for Sprint. Yet Ubuntu Touch is said to be released in April of 2014, this year. This fact gives me hope that CDMA support may be developed in the coming months.\nConclusion:\nThis question was answered for the purpose of those researching Ubuntu Touch OS and Serves not for helping you chose what to buy seeing as its been so ling since you posted this, but as a reference.\nSources:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_4\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Phone\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/+RicardoSalveti/posts/3o1tjYo9Ghx\nHow to update my already installed Ubuntu Touch image?\n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu on MSI GT60 So I recently bought a MSI GT60  laptop with W8 preinstalled and I want to dual boot with Ubuntu.\nI've been trying to make a live USB for 13.04 and I have not yet been able to boot into live or install.\nI've used different methods to create the bootable USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried with UNetbootin (from W7)\n\n*Tried with YUMI (from W7)\n\n*Tried with Startup Disk Creator (from Ubuntu)\n\n\nAll three methods were able to boot on my work laptop (Dell precision m4600) but none worked on the MSI. \nThe MSI laptop boots from USB and shows the EFI boot menu it doesn't matter which option I choose, the screen will go black and nothing will happen after that. \nIf I boot with the same USB on my work laptop, after booting from USB it goes right to a Ubuntu-like environment and shows me two options, to install or to try Ubuntu and works as it should.\nHas anyone been on the same situation? Any advice?\nAs far as I can tell I think of some bios/configuration (EFI?) incompatibility. \nSata configuration is set as AHCI. I have W8 installed, a second HDD and no other partitions.\n\nA: I had the same issue on my GT 60 20C and was able to get it to work after a little bit of work.\nFirst, I created a bootable USB disk with the 13.1 installation. I was experiencing the black screen issue after the first purple screen from the bootable USB disk. To avoid that issue, press CTRL right when the screen first shows up. You should see the language selection screen and right after, mode options. Before installing, press F6 and select \nnomodeset\n\nThis step is very important, the installation will not continue unless that step is executed. After the installation is complete, boot up again with with the USB disk. Select the \"nomodeset\" option again but this time boot up the live installation (Try Ubuntu...)\nDownload boot-repair utility. I was not able to follow the steps from the Ubuntu webpage (something broken about apt). I installed all the debian packages manually from the sourceforge website.\nThere, make sure that GRUB is on your Ubuntu partition and as an advanced option set as a kernel parameter \"nomodeset\"\nReboot your computer and now you should be good to go.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a Live USB created using UNebootin or Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator.  I would get a list of options to boot into, but after selecting one, I kept getting a message like, \"insert a boot device.\"\nThen I created a live CD using Startup Disk Creator for KDE (usb-creator-kde) and this worked fine.\nAlso, someone mentioned that plugging the Live USB stick into a USB 2.0 port instead of a USB 3.0 port was helpful to them.  (I'm not so sure about this because USB 3.0 is supposed to be backward compatible, but you might give it a shot).\n\nA: Ok, here is another way...\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename /EFI/BOOT folder to /EFI/Ubuntu in the USB.\n\n*Download refind bootloader (0.7.7.1..) and extract the refind folder which contains the refind_x64.efi, icons, drivers etc.  to /EFI folder.\n\n*Rename /EFI/refind to /EFI/BOOT\n\n*Rename /EFI/BOOT/refind_x64.efi  to /EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.efi\n\n*Copy /EFI/BOOT/refind.conf-sample to /EFI/BOOT/refind.conf\n\n*Edit refind.conf file, comment all boot entries and add the following in the last...\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu\" {  \n        loader  /casper/vmlinuz.efi  \n        icon    EFI/refind/icons/os_linux.icns  \n        initrd  /casper/initrd.lz  \n        options \"root=PARTUUID=xxxx-xxxx rw rootfstype=vfat file=/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper add_efi_memmap\"  \n} \n\nReplace xxxx-xxxx with UID of USB drive.\nHappy booting!\n\nA: In your BIOS (indeed you have an UEFI firmware), please disable SecureBoot, and if possible also the FastBoot and IntelSRT options. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI for more info.\nThen reboot on your Ubuntu key.\n\nA: There are lots of reports of the Bios needing to be updated before you can successfully \ndual boot. The original uefi bioses that were distributed on laptops, etc \nare generally not working with dual booting properly.\nAlso here is a link to a lengthy but excellent description of how to \nsuccessfully install ubuntu under a dual boot environment.\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tired-of-windows-8-how-to-dual-boot-windows-ubuntu/\nPS Thats a nice laptop you have! :)\n\nA: It seems like many MSI laptops have problems dual-booting Ubuntu, including my own. Here is where I posted about my problem; I have a GE72 model. \nThis guide looks quite promising for installing Ubuntu on MSI laptops. I don't have an SSD either, but given that step 4 involves enabling UEFI with CSM, I am quite certain that this will work (CSM refers to legacy BIOS, which should allow compatibility with Ubuntu). Once I try it myself, I will give an update.\nThis link has a description of someone else who got Ubuntu working on their GT60 2OC.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I have an MSI GT60-2PE Dominator Pro laptop. From my experience, I have failed to install Ubuntu 12.04, however everything works with Ubuntu 14.04 :)\nThe main issue was for me the Nvidia Optimus video card (and also the SSD RAID 0). I have used Startup Disk Creator to create a USB key. If you want to use GNOME you need to use at least gnome-shell 3.12 (the default is 3.10 with ubuntu 14.04, otherwise => black screen). \nFor the nvidia driver you need this ppa: \nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net/graphics-drivers/ppa/ubuntu\nFor GNOME 3.12 you need these PPAs: \nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome3-team/gnome3/ubuntu and http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome3-team/gnome3-staging/ubuntu .  \nI highly recommend to use Macrium Reflect to create a backup of your Windows 8 partition before you try to modify this one.\nI have just reduced the size of the window partition because when I try to move this partition my windows is broken.\n\nA: I had the same problem (black screen, MSI GT60) , but for me the solution was easy.\nI had to turn ON SecureBoot, and it worked directly (i tried everything else without success before that). Can't explain why ...\n\nA: Archlinux is working flawless in uefi mode on my GT60-2OD. from archlinux grub menu I can boot Ubuntu ISO as loopback in uefi mode successfully without any kernel option.\nto try..\n\n\n*\n\n*install archlinux in uefi mode  \n\n*copy the Ubuntu ISO (ver 13.10) to the /boot/iso folder (iso folder to be created)  \n\n*add the following menu in /boot/grub/grub.conf...  \nmenuentry \"ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.iso\" --class iso   \n{  \ninsmod loopback  \ninsmod iso9660  \n#insmod fat        # If ISO is located on fat16 or fat32 formatted partition.  \nset isofile=\"/iso/ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.iso\"  \nloopback loop (hd1,gpt1)$isofile  \nlinux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz.efi boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile noeject noprompt --  \ninitrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz  \n}  \n\nNote: (hd1,gpt1) to be changed, by checking the isofile location in grub command prompt.  \nit is working for me.\nedit: Jack's answer is also working...Turn on Secure boot and boot from USB.\n", "Q: Where did SDK7 go? I installed from Oracle SDK 7 but it did not say the path of the SDK.How can i find that where did the SDK go?I must set JAVA_HOME.\n\nA: You could do an exhaustive search for \"java\"...\n$ cd /; find . -name 'java' 2>/dev/null\n\n\nA: Apart from P J Singh's solution(in which you may have to parse through a long list of files), if you have installed java, and can run using javac and java commands, you should be able to fetch the location of the binary using which javac and which java. This will give you the location of the binary file. If, by JAVA_HOME, you mean the location of the jre, it is /usr/.\n", "Q: How to remove Windows after install WUBI? I installed Ubuntu using the Windows installer and I was wondering how to get rid of the old windows install, deleting it and everything with it. \nI tried to just install it from my external hard drive but that didn't work.\n\nA: I was in the same situation two weeks ago.\nI found out that the best thing is to do a clean installation of Ubuntu.\nIt seems to be more stable apparently.\nEdit: Check this How to remove Windows 7 from alongside with 12.04\n", "Q: Ubuntu core on new Nexus 7?

Thank you in advance.\n\nA: You also have the 4 primary partition issue.\nMy laptop already has 4 primary partitions: how can I install Ubuntu?\nBe sure to create recovery DVD(s) first as well as a Windows repair CD.\nHP Tools Partition discussion\nIf you shrink Windows using Windows disk tools and backup HP tools. You can then use gparted to create one large extended partition and have many logical partitions. You can restore HP tools in one if you want. You can make a shared NTFS data partition if you want and you can install Ubuntu in / (root), swap and /home again if you want that as a separate partition.\nUpdate:\nIf system was an Ultrabook it has Intel SRT which somehow uses RAID. You need to turn off the SRT and then remove the meta-data on both drives. If still booting Windows you can turn SRT back on and it should work.\nsudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda\nsudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sdb\n\nSome other issues can be dynamic or LDM partitions if you used Windows to create extra partitions, or left over gpt backup partition table where drive was gpt and you use Windows install in MBR mode.\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1970636\nIf you read this thread, the moderators answer to the OP suggests that if you run gparted from a live cd / usb and partition your drives yourself beforehand, it will solve this glitch, and also speed up the install process, since it can now use the swap partition to speed up the process.\nGoogle how to make a gparted live usb/cd, whichever you prefer, and format your partitions with however much space you want for the root system, a separate /home if you like, and a swap formatted partition equal to the amount of ram you have, measured in GiB (according to the moderator in the linked forum thread).\n", "Q: DVD -playback function Can I put a DVD in my DVD-drive and check it or should I download some other programme together with Ubuntu?

I'm slowly getting used to it, but I've just tried to copy files on to an empty USB 4gb flash drive (well I've actually tried two different ones) and it says there's no room to copy.  I've looked at the properties of the drive - 0 free space, 0 used space.  Where's my storage gone?!\nI've tried emptying the trash, unmounting, remounting etc, nothings working :(\nI'm not technical so if you know how to fix it please explain like I'm a dummy!\n\nA: If you have nothing important on the drive that you are trying to recover, just reformat the drive. Since you said you are not very technical I'll give you some easy to follow instructions on how to do so.\nFirst off, open up a terminal (ctrl + alt + t) and type the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nsudo gparted\nThis will install and open a program called gparted which is a very simple to use yet very powerful piece of software that will allow you to reformat you USB. The sudo command will prompt you for a password which should be the same as you login password.\nOnce gparted is open, select your USB in the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nThe USB will need to be unmounted for you to perform any actions on it so keep that in mind. Be absolutely sure that the device you select is your USB! I have learned from personal experience that lack of attention during this step can be disastrous (accidentally wiped my entire hard drive :/).\nAfter selecting you have selected the USB device, click on one of the colored rectangles that represent the different partitions on your USB. Your USB should only have one.\nThen click on the Partition option on the menu at the top of the screen and followed by a click on the Format to option within that menu. There are several formats that will be made available to you but most USBs come pre-formatted as FAT32 so I would suggest just sticking with the default.\n\nNow that you have selected FAT32 as the format, click on the green check mark just below the Partition menu option and gparted will do the rest!\n\nUnless something is wrong with the hardware of the USB, this should fix your problem. I actually had this same issue just a couple days ago. Hope this helps and welcome to Ubuntu!\n\nA: When using Linux and you delete a file from your USB you have to remember to empty the trash on your desktop or all the deleted files go into a folder \".trash-1000\".\nIf this doesn't recover the space simply reformat. \n\nA: I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. When you delete files on a flash drive using the GUI, Ubuntu instead moves the deleted files to a hidden directory on the flash drive. The hidden directory will typically be called something like .Trash. You need to delete this hidden directory to free up the space.\n1) Navigate to the flash drive's directory:\n    cd /media/userName/flashDrive\n\n2) Show all directories, including the hidden ones:\n    ls -al\n\n3) There should be a hidden directory there. On my computer it was .Trash-1000/. Now delete that file:\n    sudo rm -r .Trash-1000/\n\nNow the space should be free.\n\nA: It might have gone raw ? Try formatting your hard drive. That may help your case or else, run a scan for bad sectors (http://linuxpoison.blogspot.in/2008/01/howto-check-disk-drive-for-errors-and.html). Hope that helps.\n\nA: The deleted files are probably now in a hidden Trash folder.  Select \"Show Hidden Files\" and then delete them again.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu without loss of data I have Windows 7 installed. I want to switch to Ubuntu 12.04 without losing any of my data.\nIn other words, I want to have all my files accessible from Ubuntu.\n\nA: First make a backup of all the files that you want to keep\nThis should be made in every case. A computer or a hard drive can always fail, so everyone who has important files should make backups from time to time. You'll especially need to do this in both of this cases.\n\"I want to use Ubuntu and Windows side by side (dual boot)\"\nDo this if you want to decide when you turn on your machine whether you want to use windows or Ubuntu. When you install Ubuntu, it will offer you to install it besides your Windows installation. You can access the files on your Windows system easily, since it will appear as a hard drive in the file browser of Ubuntu.\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*(you may do a backup of your most important files (recommended), just to be on the safe way)\n\n*download disc image and create a bootable usb device or CD/DVD\n\n*boot from the device you created\n\n*follow the instructions to install Ubuntu besides Windows\n\n*to access your files just go to the file manager and search for the windows hdd partition.\n\n\n\"I want to use Ubuntu only and delete Windows (and therefore all it's files)\"\nThe easiest will be to backup all the files you need (for example on an external HDD or other USB device) and install Ubuntu from scratch. It's exactly the same as above, but while installation choose to delete windows and use ubuntu only. All files will be deleted, so make sure your backup is complete.\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a backup of all the files you want to keep.\n\n*download disc image and create a bootable usb device or CD/DVD\n\n*boot from the device you created\n\n*follow the instructions to install Ubuntu, and choose to delete Windows during installation.\n\n*copy the backup on your Ubuntu installation.\n\n\nA: If you are dual booting then they should be accessible from the file manager in Ubuntu. If you are replacing Windows with Ubuntu then you would need to back everything up and transfer after you finish installing.\n\nA: First of all, do a backup of all your personal data. I'm not saying that you will surely loss all your information, just in the rare cases somethings happens it's better to be prepared. The way you backup your data is all up to you.\nNow, you didn't specify if you want Dual Boot (both Ubuntu and Windows installed in their own partition and you can select what to use at boot) or wipe out your system and use only Ubuntu (in this case the backup is mandatory, since there isn't a simple way to migrate your data, that I'm aware of).\n", "Q: Can't Use Radeon 8790M on Latitude E6540 with Kubuntu 13.04 Trying to use the Radeon 8790M on my Dell Latitude E6540 running Kubuntu 13.04 (Raring).

All I get now is the grub rescue prompt. I have a Live USB from Ubuntu but I cannot do anything with it. I changed the boot device priority from BIOS but it still won't boot from anything. I have read other similar posts but on most of them, booting from a live usb/cd is suggested. \nHowever, that doesn't work in my case, as described. The ls command first shows something like \n(hd0), (hd0,msdos2) , (hd0,msdos3), (hd1), (hd1, msdos1) \n\nand when I try ls on each of them it says unknown file system.\n\nA: The way to go depends of how you did installed your system:\nIf you installed /home in a separated partition\nIf this is the case you are lucky, just download the latest stable versions of Ubuntu (could be either 12.04 LTS or 13.04), create your LiveCD/USB (in the downloads page it offers enough information about how to create those), then boot with it. Now stop! From here on you should be very aware of what you are doing.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you start the Live system, check if your data it's still in the partition that was your /home. If it's still there, verify it's filesystem name using fdisk -l in a terminal.

You should be able to boot just Ubuntu from UEFI menu in CSM or BIOS mode. That would have UEFI off and with UEFI off, there is no secure boot option.\nSome systems only boot Windows with secure boot on. Others boot with it off, but Windows is installed in UEFI mode. Since UEFI & BIOS write hardware info to system differently you cannot dual boot from grub menu but only by going into UEFI and turning it on for Windows or off for the BIOS install.\nBetter to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode and then you should be able to dual boot from grub menu. But some systems will only boot Windows with secure boot on and you have to boot the Boot-Repair program in secure boot mode to get to install the Ubuntu signed kernels that will work with secure boot.\nIt looks like Boot-Repair already converted your BIOS install to UEFI, but you do not have signed kernel so Ubuntu will only boot with secure boot off. A few system do not allow that or only allow the Windows efi file to boot.

In particular, it's generally best to keep all installed OSes booting in the same mode (BIOS or EFI). You do seem to have EFI-mode GRUB files, but your Boot Repair seems to have been run in BIOS mode, so there's no information on the EFI's boot order, and it's unclear if GRUB would come up when you reboot in EFI mode. Thus, you might need to re-run Boot Repair in EFI mode or deal with the boot order issue in some other way. For instance, in Windows you could open an Administrator Command Prompt window and type:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nThe issues with buggy Samsung firmware that cause the computer to brick itself have been worked around, although you should be careful to use a recent kernel. (Upgrade to the latest available from the Ubuntu 13.04 repositories and you should be fine.)\nI disagree with oldfred when it comes to some of the Secure Boot issues. Most notably, I have yet to hear a credible report of Windows failing to boot because Secure Boot is disabled. To be sure, I have heard reports of Windows failing to boot when Secure Boot is disabled, but such reports have always been vague and/or some other variable has been at play, giving rise to alternative interpretations of the phenomenon. I have, however, seen several credible reports of people who disable Secure Boot and have no problems booting Windows thereafter. Thus, I recommend simply leaving Secure Boot disabled, at least at first. If you want to enable it later, you certainly may (and there are at least potential security benefits to using Secure Boot), but I recommend taking it one step at a time, with Secure Boot re-enablement being one of the last (and optional) steps.\n", "Q: Decrypt home folder without passphrase I just reinstalled Ubuntu after my system crashed.

I.e., when I log in, I select \"Xsession\" in lightdm, and I have an .xsession file in my home directory which executes gnome-session --session=xmonad, where /usr/gnome-session/sessions/xmonad.session contains a modified gnome session which selects xmonad as the window manager.

I've googled my way around and only found quite complicated solutions like find . -depth -not \\( -name 'one' -o -name 'two' \\\n-o -name 'three' \\) -exec rm {} \\; as stated here.\nIs there a possibility to do this in an easier way - without that detour to find?\nE.g. rm -rf --exclude='one' --exclude='two' --exclude='three' * like in rsync or just rm -rf -e 'one','two','three' *?\nMaybe even a general possibility to exclude things from * (so other commands like cp, mv, ... don't have to implement their own)? Something like *{'one','two','three'} or so?\n\nA: I've built except exactly for that (sry that I wasn't able to add documentation yet).\nI you have a folder like the following:\n$ ls\na b c d\n\nTyping except b d will give you a and c\n$ except b d\nac\n\nNow you can pipe that to rm.\nexcept b d | xargs -0 rm\n\nThis may be hard to remember, so why not just build a script on top of except, called\nrm-except:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nexcept \"$@\" | xargs -0 rm\n\nSimilarly easy is ls-except:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nexcept \"$@\" | xargs -0 ls\n\n\nA: For Bash there is a shell option called extglob that is deactivated by default to keep compatibility with standard shell syntax. Extglob complements the syntax by additional operators like !(), ?(), @() and some more.\nTo switch extglob on, type shopt -s extglob. To keep it switched on for the current user type echo 'shopt -s extglob' >> ~/.bashrc.\nFor the rm example: With extglob you can use\nrm -rf !(one|two|three)\n\n\nA: As an alternative to extglob (though that is a very good answer and everyone should have shopt -s extglob globstar in their .bashrc), you can use the $GLOBIGNORE global variable. Let's say you want to get every file except 'foo.txt' and 'bar baz.txt':\nGLOBIGNORE=foo.txt:'bar baz.txt'\n\n...however, this will turn the shell option dotglob on, which means that * will match files beginning with a dot (which are normally hidden). So you actually need two commands:\nGLOBIGNORE=foo.txt:'bar baz.txt'\nshopt -u dotglob\n\nSince this is a global variable, it will affect every glob you use until $GLOBSTAR is unset either by logging out or with\nGLOBIGNORE=\n\nIt will also only work on the literal strings passed to the variable. You can see what I mean by setting $GLOBIGNORE and looking at the difference between these commands:\nprintf '%s\\n' *\nprintf '%s\\n' ./*\n\n", "Q: How to add DNS suffix in Ubuntu 12.04?

When this happens, if mouse cursor is on any window titles, The Unity Launcher and Panel, the cursor becomes busy. After a while, the problem simply goes.\nI can't send a screenshot because it doesn't show up in the screenshot.\nI face this problem when try to run some applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu one\n\n*gksudo nautilus\n\n\nHardware Specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Seagate Barracude 3.5\" 7200RPM HDD\n\n*MSI Z77A-G43\n\n*Kingston HyperX 1600MHz DDR3 RAM 4GB\n\n*Core i5-2500k\n\n*My computer uses the Intel HD 3000 that is on i5-2500k\n\n\nI don't use any other driver than the one that comes with Ubuntu 13.04\nHere is a video that you can see the problem produced: https://www.dropbox.com/s/61rzeutdogog821/out-2.ogv\nI can say that there is not considerable change regarding the consumption of system resources while the cursor is spinning.\n\nA: This is definitely a problem I've noticed as well. I have a very fast computer with an SSD and no CPU was being used by the process giving the cursor. An empty gedit window would show the dang thing.\nIn fact this problem drove me so crazy, I decided to go with the \"hackish\" solution - get rid of the \"thinking\" cursor.  I never needed it anyways.\nThe way to get rid of the \"thinking\" cursor without breaking anything is to simply replace it with the normal cursor image.\nIf you're using the default cursor theme DMZ-White, simply open a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) and run these commands:\ncd /usr/share/icons/DMZ-White/cursors\nsudo mv watch watch.old\nsudo ln -s left_ptr watch\nnohup unity --replace &\nexit\n\nRestart if the problem still occurs.\nNow, this doesn't technically fix the problem, but it definitely hides it out of annoyance.\n\nA: That's a very difficult question to answer. Excluding hardware malfunctions (especially hard drives) the following is what I experienced in these years of Ubuntu.\nAt each release Ubuntu tends to be slightly more demanding HW-wise. It happens that a video card driver or xorg update make the OS snappier but in the long run you always need a more powerful rig.\nThis is normal because hardware keeps evolving and so does Ubuntu. You can't release today an OS that works equally well on modern and 10yo PCs.\nSo if you are low spec'ed especially in RAM and CPU power, you might want not to update to the latest bleeding edge version, or you may want to switch to a less demanding distribution  like lubuntu.\nIf you have less than 2GB of ram, that would be the first thing to upgrade. I noticed that for a standard office use you barely notice any difference between 4gb or 8gb, but if you have less than 2GB you risk to use too much disk swap (which may cause the infamous spinning wheel).\nUnfortunately I noticed that Ubuntu and Gnome in general are not as snappy as they used to be even on super powered PCs. I had a latest model i7 with 16gb and nvidia card, but sometimes the system was lagging anyway (even on barebone distros like Arch).\nThe only solution I could find (without switching to a different windows manager) was to install an SSD. That's the best update you can do to your PC. Even a very small SSD just for the / partition (while data might be stored on regular HDD) makes a big (big) difference.\nAlso switching to a different file browser might help you out in some situations where the culprit is Nautilus, but the best is to switch to SSD.\nYou may try to sooth the symptoms by removing background processes, for example you can try to remove zeitgeist, but at the end the less painful solution seems to be an SSD.\n\nA: have what I think is a similar issue: Seems Canonical waits a full 15 to 20 minutes after the system is booted and a browser has been opened, and then they do something which takes control of the HD and keeps it perpetually Busy., So much so that I can't actually access any functioning of the OS. It must be a nice OS.. Too bad they occupy it to such an extent that it cannot be used when they are .\n", "Q: A script for moving files from subdirs to parent dir I am looking for a script for moving files from  subdirs to the parent directory\nMy folder structure looks like this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Inside of a folder A I have a lot of folders named 1,2,3,4,5... \n\n*All these folders contain 2 more folders named B and C. \n\n*B and C contain files that I want to move one level up, then delete folders B and C. \n\n\nThank you in advance for any help you can give me with this script\n\nA: You can use:\nfind test/*/* -type d | xargs -n1  sh -c 'echo mv -b ${0}/* \"$( dirname ${0})\" \";\" rm -rvf ${0} '\n\nIt will just print Output on screen as below :\nmv -b test/1/B/file1 test/1/B/file2 test/1/B/file3 test/1 ; rm -rvf test/1/B\nmv -b test/1/C/file1 test/1/C/file2 test/1/C/file3 test/1 ; rm -rvf test/1/C\nmv -b test/2/B/file1 test/2/B/file2 test/2/B/file3 test/2 ; rm -rvf test/2/B\nmv -b test/2/C/file1 test/2/C/file2 test/2/C/file3 test/2 ; rm -rvf test/2/C\nmv -b test/3/B/file1 test/3/B/file2 test/3/B/file3 test/3 ; rm -rvf test/3/B\nmv -b test/3/C/file1 test/3/C/file2 test/3/C/file3 test/3 ; rm -rvf test/3/C\nmv -b test/4/B/file1 test/4/B/file2 test/4/B/file3 test/4 ; rm -rvf test/4/B\nmv -b test/4/C/file1 test/4/C/file2 test/4/C/file3 test/4 ; rm -rvf test/4/C\nmv -b test/5/B/file1 test/5/B/file2 test/5/B/file3 test/5 ; rm -rvf test/5/B\nmv -b test/5/C/file1 test/5/C/file2 test/5/C/file3 test/5 ; rm -rvf test/5/C\n\nIf output looks OK then you can simply append  | sh at the end of that command, then it will run command which is shows in output. \n\nA: The following commands will do the job:\ncd /path/to/A\nfind -mindepth 3 -type f -execdir mv {} .. \\;\nfind -mindepth 2 -type d -exec rm -d {} \\;\n\nSee also man find for differences between -exec and -execdir actions.\n\nA: Given your directory structure, you don't need find for this -- the shell will suffice:\n# the trailing slash below restricts results to directories\nfor dir in /path/to/A/*/; do\n    mv \"$dir\"/[BC]/* $dir && rmdir \"$dir\"/[BC]\ndone\n\n\nA: The second set of for loops in the script below should do what you're looking for.

You should use these releases if you want the newest versions of software and are prepared to upgrade regularly. 13.10 is still considered a pre-release alpha version and should only be used if you like getting your hands dirty.\nIf you do not want to upgrade regularly, use the Long Term Support release, currently 12.04. This is supported for 5 years after release. (The upcoming 14.04 will also presumably be an LTS release).\nAn out-of-support release receives no updates, so security problems found and patched in later versions are not fixed. That is not to say that it instantly becomes unsafe to use, since there are relatively few threats targetting desktop linux of any flavour, but it would be unwise to use an obsolete version for either running servers or browsing the web, since these are the most likely attack vectors.\n(Note that short term releases before 13.04 received 18 months support instead of 9).\n", "Q: rEFInd showing multiple ubuntu after update I use rEFInd to boot ubuntu from a Macbook Pro.  Ubuntu asked me to update (not upgrade), and I did.  When I restarted, rEFInd was showing two entries for ubuntu (Boot boot\\vmlinuz-0.2.7 vs. 0.1.9 for example).\nIs this problematic?  Is there any way to remove the extra boot entry?  Is there any way to prevent this from happening after future updates?\n\nA: This happened because a new kernel was installed, triggering that rEFInd created a new entry. vmlinuz is the name of the Linux kernel executable. When 2 or more kernels are installed, you can use either of them and select them at boot.\n\nIs this problematic?\n\nNo. It's just a new entry, you can select either and you should boot on Ubuntu. Please, be aware that the newer kernel is normally better than the old one.\n\nIs there any way to remove the extra boot entry?\n\nThere is no \"extra\". Just a new one, that includes the latest updates and fixes. When upgrading the packages again, the package management will delete the oldest kernel automatically. If you feel the newer kernel works fine, you can also uninstall the older kernel.\n\nIs there any way to prevent this from happening after future updates?\n\nYou should not prevent this behavior, is totally expected and the best way to go. You also shouldn't prevent the kernel updates, since it leaves you with possible bugs and unsupported new hardware, or without latest optimizations.\nOne easy way to set your latest Ubuntu kernel as rEFInd default would be to use file manager to confirm location of refind.conf; if you are not sure already.  A default rEFInd install would be /boot/efi/EFI/rEFInd/refind.conf but yours could be different.\nOnce the location is confirmed open gedit with superpowers gksu gedit /boot/efi/rEFInd/refind.conf making sure your refind location is used.\nUse Ctrl + F and type \"default_selection\" in the text box that opens to find the location of setting that is needed to change. Change the numerical value to 2 or 3 according to where the icon is displayed by rEFInd at boot time. (numbers ascend left to right with no zero i.e.the first on left is 1).  \nRemember to uncomment the #default_selection line (the one we just edited) to make it applicable. Save the document and close gedit.  \nAfter making sure everything is behaving as expected after editing refind.conf; you could repeat the gedit procedure in order to change refind.conf file but this time adjusting the timeout 20 to a lower value. Setting it to 2 gives just about enough time to catch refind if needed (if paying attention) but will improve boot time left unattended.\n", "Q: Switching from Ubuntu Desktop to Ubuntu Tablet I have been considering buying a Lenovo Yoga 11S (I am aware that I will have to recompile the kernel due to the wireless driver).

That's convergence.  So to answer your question about whether Ubuntu will run on your Lenovo Yoga 11S, that answer is yes.\n\n*While it does not ship this way out of the box, there is a package that surfaces the position sensor (as well as the 9DOF and ambient light sensors) into userspace, and that can be scripted to hook into other functionality such as rotating the display, disabling the physical keyboard, and enabling the on-screen keyboard.  I have a Yoga, I have done this.\n\n*You may want to experiment with the Unity 8 shell, since most applications built for X11 and the Unity 7 shell work poorly with a touch-only device.\n\n*Work is ongoing in Ubuntu to make convertible devices work smoothly out of the box, but don't expect it delivered in 16.10.  Maybe (no promises) 17.04, so keep on top of the current -dev version if you're willing to experiment.\n\nA: My understanding is that Unity 8, in it's current incarnation, is the tablet UI that we have seen.

I have just changed my HDD on my pc to 500gb one. Since my motherboard has only one SATA port, i had to remove the older one. Therefore, i installed Windows XP on it first. Then, i rebooted and then booted from my USB containing Ubuntu 13.04. I selected install Ubuntu. I went through the first step (the neccessary requirements one) and then it took me to a step showing me 3 partitions. Actually, one of them referred to the whole HDD, whereas the other two were partitions. One of them was Windows XP NTFS partition. The pther was Windows recovery partition.\nI don't know why, it did not show me the step to select \"Install alongside Windows\". It took me to a step where i had option to select to either wipe the whole hdd, or \"Something Else\".\nI counted the steps, it was 1, 2 and then suddenly 4! Whats up with this thing? Corrupted pen drive?\nAlthough i can do one thing, which i think should work. I can use some partition tool on windows to create another partition, and then select that partition for ubuntu. But before doing that i want to know whether this problem can be solved without it or not. Because i know that GParted is a powerful tool, and that would be a better option.\n\nA: If you have no unallocated space and/or do not have another primary partition to use as the extended partition the only options are to totally replace whatever you have or manually change partitions around.\nYou need to shrink the XP partition. Best to do that with gparted on live installer and then boot XP so it can run chkdsk and make its repairs. Then you will have unallocated and if you have not used all 4 primary partitions you can do the auto install or manually create partitions. \nYou can also create partitions while in gparted, but still have to use manual install to chose which is / (root) what format (ext4) and then if you want /home and its format.

This is the error:\nRestarting web server apache2 \nAH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message\n\nI need some help.\nThank you\n\nA: First of all, I believe the newer versions of Apache do not use httpd.conf or any of that so I'm not going to discuss \"httpd\" anything.\nI believe the right way to make this warning go away is to NOT TOUCH apache2.conf.\nI've read that this file is updated any time apache2 is updated and if you're like me, you don't want things you've already done to get undone.  So use a .conf file under /etc/apache2/available-sites/\nMy installation had a default file... like 000-default.conf.  If yours doesn't you should probably google a2enconf and learn about creating the .conf files and using a2enconf to make the symlinks.\nFirst thing I did was uncomment ServerName and set it to localhost expecting the warning to go away.  Alas, the warning was still there.\nMy warning had the word 'global'.  So I realized the line I changed was inside a <VirtualHost> tag and supposed that wasn't global.  I added \"ServerName localhost\" on the outside of the vhost tag but still in the 000-default.conf file and voila.  Problem solved.  And I didn't need to touch apache2.conf so I will never have to bugger with this again even when I update and Apache overwrites apache2.conf.  I Hope this clarifies some things about the warning.  I hate warnings as much as errors.  I like everything to function perfectly but also quietly.\n\nA: A hostname is called fully qualified when a domain name is appended to it.\nservername is not fully qualified, servername.domainname.org is.\nWhen the command hostname is used to return the hostname of a system, hostname -f is used to return the fully qualified hostname.\nIf you run this command on your system and it return nothing, then you may expect this warning in Apache and in some other programs too.\nIn this case, if you really want to cure to problem, you will have to define /etc/hosts accordingly :\n<your ip> servername.domainname servername\n\nExample, if my IP is 10.1.1.1, my domain example.com and my hostname host1, a minimal /etc/hosts file would be :\n127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain localhost\n10.1.1.1    host1.example.com host1\n\nAfter this, the command hostname will return host1 and hostname -f returns host1.example.com.\nBy doing so, no need to tell your Apache that your hostname is localhost. No need to modify the main Apache configuration file, so the next time Apache will be updated, you won't loose your setting or have the new config file not merged into the existing one.\n\nA: To fix that problem, you need to edit the httpd.conf file.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nBy default httpd.conf file is blank, just add the following:\nServerName localhost\n\nOnce you're done, save the file, and restart the server.\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nOR\nTo solve this problem just set ServerName.\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/conf.d/name\n\nFor example set the name as localhost or any other name that you want:\nServerName localhost\n\nThe just restart Apache 2\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\n", "Q: Chromium: \"Running without the SUID sandbox!\" error I've downloaded and unpacked a fresh copy of Chromium (Linux_x64), and when I try to run the chrome binary, this happens:\n[23986:23986:0806/143027:FATAL:browser_main_loop.cc(148)] Running without the SUID sandbox!

Needless to say that this downloaded package wasn't installed with setuid root :p (nor would I suggest to change it to 4755, because that doesn't sound very secure to do).\n\nA: On an Ubuntu 13.04 computer, the executable chromium-browser-sandbox has the file permission 4755 and is owned by root\nroot@ubuntu:~# ls -l /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser-sandbox\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 13904 Jul 18 16:11 /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser-sandbox\n\nI guess you need to use the command chown root.root /path/to/chrome_sandbox to make root the owner of the executable.\n\nA: For the problem Running without the SUID sandbox!

This file gets overwritten when apache gets upgraded from apt.  For Apache configuration that you don't want to get overwritten, you should create a new file.

If any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block inode to prevent them from being allocated to a file or directory. If this option is specified twice, then the bad block scan will be done using a non-destructive read-write test\n\nSource: \"errno 5 - input/output error\" when trying to install\n\nA: Don't open the ISO with WinRar.

My problem seems to be the reverse of most!!\nFully functional Win8/64-bit laptop, performed dual-boot install of v13.04 per instructions on LinuxBSDos.com forums.  \nI expected the machine to boot to Windows to complete last step (tweak of boot loader), but instead I can only get into the Ubuntu install!  \nNo bootloader screen, no selection, just right into Ubuntu!  \nAll existing Win8 partitions are still intact when finished installing 13.04, so just looking for some help on where to go from here.  \nIt has been years since I worked with Linux much, so not familiar with the tools in the curernt release!\n\nA: I too was not able to boot into Win after installing U13.04 (but for a different reason). \nTry installing grub customizer. It helped me to rectify my problem. Its a GUI editor for grub. Once installed it can be accessed through the launcher. Check if Win8 loader option exist. Be careful. Don't edit anything. Just check for Win8 boot-loader option. \nI would also recommend running Boot Repair\n", "Q: Cant find 7Zip after installation Mythbuntu I installed 7Zip through web but cant find it in the menue nor anywhere else.\nWhat goes wrong?\nGreets \nTom\n\nA: I found that I had to also install xarchiver:\nsudo apt-get install p7zip xarchiver\nThen run xarchiver (should be in the Accessories menu) and 7zip will be a format available.\n", "Q: Switch from Ubuntu 13.04 64bit to 32bit Actually after reading my problem, most of you will laugh at me. I myself am, for such a stupid mistake.\nWhat exactly happened was, I was downloading 32-bit version of Ubuntu 13.04 for my old PC. After downloading, one of my friend also wanted Ubuntu 13.04, although his PC had a 64-bit hardware. So I thought of downloading 64-bit version too. But mistakenly, instead of writing the ia64 version onto his USB drive, I wrote the 64-bit OS, replacing my 32-bit one.\nAnd I gave him a blank pen drive.\nWhile installing Ubuntu, I certainly felt something was different. Different in the sense, that it was taking to much time to load. And then while using Gnome Tweak Tool, I found out it actually was 64 bit.\nAnd I have also changed my HDD, so I don't have the ISO files any more. So any way to go to 32-bit without losing data or anything?\n\nA: I'm not sure that there is a good way to downgrade to 32bit. You can however install ia32-libs-multiarch to add 32bit support to the 64bit OS: \nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch\n\nsource\n", "Q: Making xinput change permenant I don't like the default functionality of the mouse's scroll wheel click doing a \"paste\".  I can change that by doing the follwing:\n$ xinput set-button-map 12 1 0 3 4 5 6 7\n\nThis works fine, but if I reboot, I have to remember to do it again.\nMy question is how can I make this happen automatically if I need to reboot, etc?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: You can either run the command at every login or you can put it in the X.org configuration (/etc/X11/xorg.conf) like this:\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier     \"Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse\"\n    Driver         \"evdev\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/input/by-id/usb-Logitech_USB-PS_2_Optical_Mouse-event-mouse\"\n    Option         \"ButtonMapping\" \"12 1 0 3 4 5 6 7\"\nEndSection\n\nI don't know the identifiers and driver options of your device, but you get those with xinput and by sniffing around in /dev/input.\n\nA: You have to add that line in your .xsessionrc file.

Boot the Boot-Repair in BIOS mode and run the auto fix to install grub2's boot loader for sda5 into sda.\nWas there an error message during install that grub did not get installed. A few BIOS have security on MBR to prevent writing. If you still get an error check BIOS.\nYou can manually install grub2's boot loader to MBR also.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling GRUB 2\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreUbuntu/XP/Vista/7Bootloader\n\nA: Your issue probably comes from a limitation of your BIOS.\nHere is how to workaround it.\n\n\n*\n\n*backup your documents on an external disk (DVDs or USB)\n\n*boot into Windows. Via the Windows partitioning tools, shrink your C:/ Windows partition from 210GB to 60GB.\n\n*boot on an Ubuntu disk, choose Try Ubuntu, run the Gparted utility, delete the sda4, sda5 and sda6 partitions.\n\n*Via the Gparted tool, create a new 150GB extended partition just between your sda2 (60GB) partition and your sda3 (240GB) partition. \n\n*Inside this new partition, create a 20GB EXT4 partition. This one will contain your Ubuntu root partition. Just behing, create a small (eg 4GB) SWAP partition.\n\n*Run the Ubuntu installer. At the Installation type step, choose SomethingElse. Use the previous two partitions as your root and SWAP partitions. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiskSpace for more info.\n\n*Reboot. You should now be able to access both Windows and Ubuntu.

No error is displayed. I am using the Minecraft laucher jar file. Are there any packages I need to download in order to play Minecraft?\n\nA: A black screen can sometimes be caused by the LWJGL files being out of date, however if you can play your minecraft online this solution will not help you.\nUpdate your LWJGL Files:\nsudo apt-get install liblwjgl-java\n\nOr you can take a look at this link if the above does not work. \nYou could also consider installing OpenJDK 7\nPlease note that you have to run minecraft online at least once for it to run offline.\n\nA: This is because you installed a mod. You also deleted the META-INF folder. Rename/remove your .minecraft folder and re-try, it WILL work if the META-INF folder is present. The lwjgl files have been updated in mc1.6, so that is not the problem.\n", "Q: What to do about 6 year old laptop I have a Dell XPS M1210 with a Nvidia 7400GO and 3GB of RAM. I would like to run Ubuntu again but I have found it to be sluggish and slow with Unity, Even the Gnome Fallback seems sluggish. I don't know if it is simple as a drive problem or if it is 13.04. I remember that everything seemed fine with 12.04.\nShould I go back to the LTS of Ubuntu or should I stick it out? Can anyone recommend a less resource intensive desktop environment?\n\nA: Xubuntu uses the XFCE desktop, which is much less resource intensive. Everything else about the distro is pretty straightforward Ubuntu; packages are part of the regular Ubuntu release, so nearly every howto applies\nIf you want a more minimalistic desktop and still stay within the Ubuntu distros, try Lubuntu which uses LXDE.

Just search for Synaptic in the Dash, and click on the Synaptic icon. You will be asked to authenticate with your user password in order to open Synaptic.\nYou don't need to use sudo or gksudo to open Gedit. It is a bad idea anyway as it can cause data corruption. Instead use sudo nano from the terminal. Nano is terminal program, so it runs from the terminal instead of from a graphical user interface.

If I take a look at the ui-file generated by Glade, it says <property name=\"skip_taskbar_hint\">True</property>. In gtk code this hint is  window.set_property('skip-taskbar-hint', True). However I believe that this option is not exclusively Gtk-specific, and want to apply this one on my PyQt4-app. The Ubuntu window manager must be able to receive that hint, otherwise I would see the window of a gtk-application i use (stickynotes-indicator).

However, when I rebooted the PC, after the completion of the Ubuntu installer, with the usb pen plugged-in, the firmware boot menu detected the pen as an UEFI device but then proceeded to boot Windows 7 -- no Ubuntu or grub menu.\nI've tried Google'ing for solutions, and whilst there are many sites that give details on how to dual boot Windows and Linux on UEFI systems, they all assume that you will be able to modify the UEFI firmware settings or replace the Windows 7 bootloader (neither option is available to me, as I don't own the PC).\nTherefore, could anyone give me a detailed, step-by-step method of installing grub2 to a usb pen so that I can boot into the Ubuntu partition in UEFI mode, without changing any of the system firmware settings or modifying/replacing the existing Windows 7 bootloader?\nThe system board is an ASUS Z87-K (bios rev 0412), the SSD is an 120gb OCZ-Vertex3 (firmware rev 2.15)\nAn update: It turns out that my UEFI firmware DOES have secure boot enabled (because Windows 7 (and other OSes in 'live mode') booted fine, I assumed it was turned off). My apologies if I've been leading people up the wrong path! Since I don't own this PC, I can't turn secure boot off, so I will have to abandon the attempt at an Ubuntu installation for now. Although, according to the Canonical documentation, Ubuntu 12.04.2 and later should be able to boot on a PC with secure boot enabled? Since I can't disable secure boot to narrow-down the problem which is preventing me from successfully booting Ubuntu, I'll leave this question open, but any future installations I attempt will be done on my own hardware so I have the freedom to experiment in greater depth.\nThanks, once again, to all who responded!\n\nA: You cannot set two /boot partitions with boot-flag ! There is only one boot-flag necessary for grub2 in /boot partition - so simply deactivate boot-flag in your partition /dev/sda1\nAfter this activate boot-flag in /boot partition of /dev/sdi - sure ? this is correct ? You have a /boot partition in /dev/sdi ? So there you need to activate boot-flag ( simply with gparted ).\nAs you say ... grub2 is already installed in /dev/sdi ? If not now follows (necessary because you modified boot-flags) :\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdi\nsudo update-grub2\n\nBefore this all your machine was booting into Windows 7 of /dev/sda3 via /dev/sda1 - but now boot-flag is deactivated and set to /boot partition of /dev/sdi - and your machine should now boot to installation of your usb-drive.\nOnly in case that in UEFI-mode your machine is not able to boot into usb-drive - then you should disable UEFI-mode in BIOS-settings and enable there EFI-mode instead.\n\nA: You're almost there.  Removable media like usb will boot from a boot able EFI partition (and that's one bootable EFI partition PER DEVICE, not total), using the bootloacer /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi (for x64 architectures).  Simply copy your /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi  to /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi, and have a copy of grub.cfg in /EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg and it should boot.  Of course, the grub.cfg must be set up to boot the hard disk like you want.  Simply copying the grub.cfg off the hard disk's installation will work, but then you will need to recopy every time you update kernels, so you can make the /EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg a few lines which import the maintained /boot/grub/grub.cfg (like 13.04 does I think).\n* For Secure boot, use shim.efi for the /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi and have a copy of the SIGNED grubx64.efi in /EFI/Boot also.  grub.cfg is in the same place, /EFI/ubuntu.  Your live media uses this mechanism to boot, so if it works, this method will work.\n\nA: There is no such thing as a \"/boot flag.\" GParted and parted do have a \"boot flag\" (no leading slash), but this terminology is confusing at best. The GParted/parted \"boot flag\" is really a way to set the type code on a partition to identify it as an EFI System Partition (ESP), from which the firmware reads boot loaders. Contrary to what dschinn1001 seems to be saying, you should not set the type code for your Linux /boot partition to the ESP code. It's legal to have multiple ESPs on a single disk, although Windows is allergic to such setups, so I recommend against it. The ESP must have a FAT filesystem (technically FAT32, although FAT16 often works in practice), so unless your Linux /boot partition uses FAT, you should not set the GParted/parted \"boot flag\" on the /boot partition.\nInstalling GRUB on a USB flash drive is technically possible, but it's a bit limiting. The problem is GRUB's hard-coded configuration, which gives you two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can build GRUB in such a way that it looks for grub.cfg in the same directory as the grubx64.efi binary (that is, on the USB flash drive). This will normally work on just one computer, though, since grub.cfg contains all sorts of system-specific details.\n\n*You can build GRUB in such a way that it looks for grub.cfg on your hard disk. This may work on more computers, but it will require that each computer have a working grub.cfg file on it, and in the same location on every system. Thus, it won't work on all computers, just those that are configured in a similar way.\n\n\nUbuntu builds its grubx64.efi binary to work in the second way. Note that ubfan1's procedure assumes the first method of building GRUB, so it will work only with a custom-built GRUB binary (or a GRUB binary taken from Fedora or some other distribution that works in this way). OTOH, ubfan1's procedure might work in the second way if the systems are properly configured -- but then copying grub.cfg to the USB flash drive will be pointless.\nIf you're looking for a general-purpose emergency boot disk, GRUB isn't really the best solution -- at least, not unless Super GRUB 2 Disk comes out with EFI support or somebody else builds something similar. At the moment, the best option for an emergency EFI boot disk is my rEFInd boot manager. This program builds a list of other EFI boot programs on a computer, enabling you to boot any of them. The result is that you'll be able to boot from any boot loader (GRUB, ELILO, the Windows boot loader, etc.) that's installed on the hard disk, even if you've lost your EFI NVRAM entries. The boot loader must be properly configured, though.\nBecause Linux kernels since version 3.3.0 include built-in EFI boot loaders, rEFInd can launch them directly, too. The catch is that rEFInd needs to figure out what options to pass to the kernel -- most importantly, what your Linux root filesystem is. rEFInd can figure this out if the kernel is in the root filesystem (that is, if there's no separate /boot partition) or if a rEFInd-specific configuration file (refind_linux.conf) exists in the same directory as the kernel. Ubuntu normally doesn't use a separate /boot partition, so rEFInd on a USB flash drive or CD-R can usually launch Ubuntu directly, and should be more flexible and easier to set up than GRUB for emergency use. (The rEFInd page includes download links for CD-R and USB flash drive images.) If you've got a more complex setup and you happen to remember the name of your root filesystem (or any other kernel options you need to boot), you can edit or add them by hitting F2 or Insert twice, which opens a line editor so that you can modify the kernel's options.\n", "Q: How to kill KDE screensaver from command line Sometimes lock-screen just can't be unlocked in KDE, so I have to kill it from TTY.\nUpdate: in 4.13 plasma-overlay always respawns.

Sometimes there appear files with the .conflict extension on the folders synchronized with Ubuntu One. Why does that happen and what should I do with the conflicts?\n\nA: The conflicts occur when you start with a version X of a file on more than one computer, lets call them machine a and machine b. Then machine a edits the file making it X+a (the original version of the file plus the changes made on machine a). It takes some time for machine a to send the version X+a to the server, and some time for the server to send version X+a to machine b. So there's a window of time when machine b still has the version X (the original without the changes made on machine a). If machine b edits the file on that precise moment, it will send to the server a version X+b instead of X+a+b. In this case, the server has no way to tell which is the right version, as it is subjective depending on what the user is doing, so it will keep both versions adding a \".conflict\" extension to one of them.\nThe Ubuntu One FAQ has information about how to resolve the conflicts here.\nIf your transfer rate to and from the server is slower than your edit rate on some files synchronized with U1 on more than one machine, then U1 files doesn't sound like the right tool for you. You should look for tools with conflict handling, like u1db, bzr or git.\nIf that's not the case but you are still getting a lot of conflicts, then you might be hitting a bug and you should report it on launchpad.\nThe size of that window of time when a conflict can arise depends on many things, like your bandwidth, the load of the server, and the load of the links between your internet provider and the server.\n", "Q: How do I delete my Ubuntu One account?

But mine is both AMD and 32 bit, so im a bit confused on which one to use.) Thanks!\n\nA: Since your processor is a 32bit CPU you can only run a 32bit system.

I have mounted the volumes on my NAS to my Ubuntu Server 12.04 VM which runs as production for me for several internal and external sites.\nMy own Documents, Pictures, etc... I moved to the NAS some time ago to a folder on my own name.\nDropbox\nI have since installed Dropbox and made it into a daemon by following another article and this resulted in my user's home folder having a new folder called Dropbox inside which replicates without issue.\nMy problems comes from that inside that folder I created a soft link called Documents to the folder named after me on my NAS through the mount.  i.e.\n/home/user/Dropbox/Documents -> /mnt/nas1/vol1/Files/user\nProblem\nNow whenever I reboot it seems to me like the NAS is not mounting before Dropbox kicks in because rebooting the Ubuntu Server causes Dropbox to wipe all my files.  Then if I SSH in and run their python script to restart Dropbox then it finds everything (almost everything) again and starts to upload it.  This back and forth is causing me issues and to loose some of my files.\nCurrent status\nI have for now disabled the Dropbox daomon on my Ubuntu Server and I am currently working with Dropbox to try to restore all of my files.\nOnce I have done this, I need to come up with a better method.\nOriginal Idea\nMy original idea was that Dropbox would simply replicate all of my Documents and allow not only everything to be synced between smart phones, tables, laptops, and desktops, but for me to also keep a synced copy on my NAS for backup purposes.\nClearly at this point I cannot do this if I cannot fix the above issue so I am reaching out for some help and I would welcome ideas.\n\nA: I've gotten an answer back from Dropbox about this article by sending their support team the link and here is the main part of their answer back.\n\"Unfortunately, Dropbox does not work completely when used with a network filesystem. Dropbox is reporting this error because the Dropbox application is unable to fully access this location.\nThe problem is that network filesystems do not send messages when files change. When Dropbox first starts it will do a deep file scan and will detect changes and sync them. However, during normal operation, Dropbox waits for \"file update events\" and only physically connected drives send these events.\"\nSo I have configured my Dropbox on my Ubuntu Server 12.04 to run to the user's own folder for now and I am using rsync in a cron job to replicate over to my NAS hourly.\n\nA: Some NAS operating systems provide their own Dropbox applications, which is basically the only \"clean\", as in \"supported\" way to keep a synced copy of your Dropbox folder on a NAS or any network location for that matter. Some of these apps don't work like actual desktop clients, as they don't sync/lack an upload channel etc. \nI have read that a possible hack (reportedly works without issues for some people) is to place a symlink to a network folder on your local drive and point your Dropbox client to that symlink. Haven't tried it and can't remember the source, sorry!\nHave tried the same thing you are doing, with a lot of agony...\nI'm not sure Dropbox support is telling you the whole truth there, as there must be a way to make some of the many available network protocols send file update events.

I'm also prompted to confirm the rm type of commands, which I think is great even though a little annnoying sometimes... anyway, when I don't want to be bothered I just add a -f and all is well.\nHere is an example with cp:\nfoo@bar: /tmp$ cp hello.txt world.txt\n`hello.txt` -> `world.txt`\n\nSame goes with mv. I'm fairly sure I didn't configure it myself, so I think it's a default behavior. I'd like to do the same on other machines, and why not even control the whole thing manually and decide which commands get an echo or not if possible. I suspect this has something to do with the ~/.bashrc file, but that's about as far as I can get on my own.\nHow can I make some commands echo some feedback (like ln, cp, mv) and other prompt for confirmation (like rm and rmdir) in the console?\n\nA: For ln, cp, mv and rmdir commands, you should use -v or --verbose option. From man cp and man mv:\n\n  -v, --verbose\n          explain what is being done\n\n\nFrom man ln:\n\n   -v, --verbose\n          print name of each linked file\n\n\nFrom man rmdir:\n\n  -v, --verbose\n          output a diagnostic for every directory processed\n\n\nNote that you don't have any option to be prompted for confirmation when using rmdir, since rmdir remove empty directories. You can use rm -d instead with -i option (see below).\nFor rm command, you should use -i option. From man rm:\n\n   -i    prompt before every removal\n\n\nNow, if you want that these commands to be executed with these options all the time in terminal, you can use aliases. So, add the following lines at the end of ~/.bashrc file or in ~/.bash_aliases file:\nalias cp='cp -v'\nalias mv='mv -v'\nalias ln='ln -v'\nalias rmdir='rmdir -v' #or, better for what you asked: alias rmdir='rm -id'\nalias rm='rm -i'\n\n", "Q: How to make a script which always activates on the startup? So I'd like to add always a folder to the Path. I'm not a huge linux wizard but I think I would need to always write the \"export PATH=$PATH:(directory)\" line when I log in. But I need this to be on when I'm starting up, and I don't want to bother with Terminal everytime.\nSo looking into it a little, I found that i should add that to .bash_profile even though I'm not sure what it is or where it's located. In the home directory there's only a .bashrc file.\nHope you can help me, thanks\n\nA: Have a look under System > Preferences > Startup Applications.\nBe sure you mention the path correctly, provide a name and description for the script.\nThat should do it.\n\nA: Add path to variable $PATH\nAs your comment says... you are running Lubuntu. Then to add a new Path to your $PATH you can try this:\n1) Open a Terminal and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*gksudo leafpad /etc/environment\n(The /etc/environment file contains variables specifying the basic environment for all processes)\n\n2) In my case I added the path :/home/user/bin after /usr/local/games\n\nSo the content of my PATH is:\n\n\n*\n\n*PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/home/user/bin\"\n3) Then just logout and login to see the changes.\nAdd script to startup\n1) Open a Terminal and type.\n\n\n*\n\n*gksudo leafpad /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart\nThen you can add a command. \nMy case is \"test\" script: @bash /home/virtual/Desktop/test\n\n2) Then just logout and login to see the changes.\n", "Q: Is there any canonical chat messenger working both in android and ubuntu?

I am seeing pidgin for android.. but it's not free.\n\nA: You don't have to share the same client, just the same protocol. You can use the XMPP protocol (AKA Jabber). There are many free providers, you can see some here. Google used to use this protocol back when the messaging application was called Talk, but now it doesn't; so mind that. (You can revert to old protocol in Google AFAIK, but you should confirm that.)\n\nA: Skype has a chat/instant message  feature.

But anyways I like the way wubi works so I was kind of mad that 13.04 didn't have it. But I was playing around, and I downloaded the Ubuntu 13.04 iso file and I extracted it to a folder, and surely enough after I extracted it, I went to that folder and in that folder I found awubi.exe so I double clicked it and it worked! Now I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 off of a wubi install and it works perfectly fine for me. This shocked me because I thought they had gotten rid of wubi installs after 12.04 but I guess it's still possible. I thought I would just share this with everybody.\n\nA: From what I understand, Canonical stopped offering wubi because it does not work with UEFI-based PC's. If you upgraded to Windows 8 (it didn't come pre-installed), you probably have BIOS firmware, which wubi does work with. In any case, you don't really have a specific question you're asking here.

I noticed that I couldn't use my brightness control buttons (F11 F12). I saw the little bar like it is changing its brightness, but actually it did nothing. Then I found a command line:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nAnd there I edited this line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nAfter it just worked perfectly, but sadly my wifi went wonky and I couldn't use it actually on Ubuntu so I decided to get Lubuntu.

The shortcuts do appear in the form of an underlined letter when I hold Alt down.\nHow can I make the shortcut letter always underlined, so that the shortcuts are discoverable? Same question for menu items, by the way.\nWhat I see normally:\n\nWhat I see with Alt held down, and I want to see all the time:\n\nI found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10103922/gnome-3-always-show-altx-keyboard-shortcuts, which suggests adding gtk-auto-mnemonic = 0 to ~/.gtkrc-2.0 for Gnome 2 and dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/interface/automatic-mnemonics false for Gnome 3. Neither seems to have any effect in my session though.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04, in my sessionafter setting automatic-mnemonics to false, shortcut letters still don't appear unless I hold Alt down (I tried in pavucontrol, evince and gnome-control-center). I start my session from Lightdm and I am not running a Gnome session. My window manager is Sawfish. I do have a D-Bus daemon, and other dconf settings take effect immediately (e.g. /org/gnome/desktop/background/draw-background). If I start another session with startx on the same machine, the change of automatic-mnemonics is not reflected. However, if I run a default (Unity or Gnome) session in a different account, automatic-mnemonics takes effect immediately.\n\nA: The dconf method works for me on 12.04. What you may try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you modifying the dconf entry for the same user as with you launch the applications. (e.g. don't use sudo) The dconf settings are per-user.\n\n*Is your ~/.config/dconf/user file writeable by your user?\n\n*Maybe that file is corrupted.

What is the solution?\n\nA: First of all, I am assuming that you have your current Apache Installation pointing to the /var/www folder on your server. Which can be reached in a browser via localhost and it shows the \"It works!\" message. If so, I think your best chance will be to point to the Public folder of your Dropbox, in which you can \"host\" html webpages (Won't work for PHP).\nThe process is easy, first of all, let's include everything inside a Folder in the Public Folder of your Dropbox. See the next screenshot in which I have made an html folder in which I have dropped several html files and their respective resource folders (images, fonts, javascript, etc.)\n\nNow, let's choose an html file in which we'll right click, choose \"Dropbox\" then \"Copy Public Link\".

In the left side of the screen there are icons: Software Center, Ubuntu One, etc. System icons can be seen but icons of the programs that I have installed can not be seen. Rather there is a \"?\" for the icons. How can I solve this problem?\n\nA: I had that problem and I fixed it (I use eclipse neon)\n1) sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop\n2) add the following text to the file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eclipse \nType=Application\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= <path_to_eclipse>/eclipse\nTerminal=false\nIcon=<path_to_eclipse>/icon.xpm\nComment=Integrated Development Environment\nNoDisplay=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nName[en]=eclipse.desktop\n\n3) sudo desktop-file-install /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop\n4) cd /usr/local/bin/\n5) sudo ln -s <path_to_eclipse>/eclipse\n6) sudo cp <path_to_eclipse>/icon.xpm /usr/share/pixmaps/eclipse.xpm\nIT WORKS! I have no more Question mark!\n\nA: .desktop files control the behavior of launcher shortcuts in Linux.  To check the icon in use, you will need to open the appropriate .desktop file that is located in either /usr/share/applications or in ~/.local/share/applications by typing the following command:  (I'm assuming you installed Eclipse from the software center, so the more likely option is in use:\nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop\n\nIf this file is empty, you will need to exit without saving, and substitute the path in the command.  Go down to the line marked Icon= and if there are any comments in it (designated by #), remove this comment, as i have heard of a bug that causes the icon to display, however i don't know if it has been fixed as yet.\nIf there is no Icon= line, find an appropriate icon in .png format and put the full path in this line including the Icon=.\nEdit:\nFrom the comments, you have said that you are running this from a link on the desktop.  The proper way to do this would be to create a desktop launcher and asscociate the icon from it.  To do this, open a terminal and type:\ngedit ~/Desktop/eclipse.desktop\n\nthis will open a blank document.  To make it a launcher add this to the file, substituting the correct paths for both the Exec= and the Icon= lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Eclipse\nComment=Eclipse\nExec=<path_to_eclipse>/eclipse\nIcon=<path_to_eclipse>/icon.xpm\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=GNOME;Application;Development;\n\nSave and close, then make the file executable by typing chmod +x ~/Desktop/eclipse.desktop\nNow, when you open this shortcut, the icon set will appear in the launcher.\n\nA: You could try installing Unity Tweak and making sure your applications have an icon theme selected.  If that doesn't work try installing a different icon theme and see if it updates your icons.  If that doesn't work report back because you probably have a different issue all together.\n\nA: This should work absolutely fine :\nsudo cp /snap/gitkraken/current/usr/share/gitkraken/gitkraken.png /usr/share/icons/hicolor/512x512/apps/\n\nUpdate the icon cache\nsudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor/\n\nReload the desktop\nnautilus -q\n\n\nA: If you have an open project, to get to the launcher you have to go to File -> Close Project first, then Configure -> Create Desktop Entry\n\nA: I had the same problem when I open PhpStorm from the JatBrains Toolbox.\nThe jetbrains-phpstorm.desktop file was ok in ~/.local/share/applications folder but the app opened with question mark. The problem was that there was a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications that was created when I had an older version of PhpStorm and the icon from that file pointed to a file that did not exist.\nI removed the .desktop file from /usr/share/applications and this resolved the problem.\nNow I have the correct icon and I guess that the .desktop file used is the one from ~/.local/share/applications folder.\nI hope this helps other with this problem.\n\nA: In my case, when I pin GitKraken to show in Task Manager (Arch Linux/openSUSE 15) and then close the GitKraken application, I see only a question mark instead of the correct icon.\nThis is due to a missing file, gitkraken.svg, in /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps.\nI solved this by copying this icon to /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps.\nI hope this will help others having this issue. \n", "Q: Where is the share button in firefox 23?

If no critical problems occur \"live2\" becomes \"live1\", \"live1\" becomes \"live2\" (we do that when there is a low amount of people active on the system; so around 17:00, 18:00).\nAfter that we update the new \"live2\" server and reconnect it as the fail safe. And the data is then synched.  \nAnd then we wait for the next update cycle.\n\nIf you need the servers up and running 5 days a week you could update/upgrade on a Friday evening, Saturday or Sunday without any client noticing and with plenty room if all failed and you need to restore from a backup. If so, then our method is serious overkill but our software is used world wide so we strive for a 100% up-time. \n", "Q: about ubuntu desktop12 ssh In Ubuntu, ssh server is ok.\nAt ps -e | grep ssh has hdserver.\nBut can't connect ssh from Windows.

After I put my Windows 7 to hibernate and then when I press the power button, instead of loading the BOOT OPTIONS or GRUB screen it directly boots Windows 7. I've read in some forum that pressing ESC after you press the power button, but even it couldn't help me as the laptop started making a loud noise. \nPlease help me on how should I boot OS while hibernate W7 and again RESUME W7 after shutting down Ubuntu.\nThanks in anticipation.\n\nA: First, it's important to understand the technical reasons why what you are are hoping to achieve is likely infeasible. When you hibernate Windows the computer writes everything in memory to the harddrive and powers off the computer. When hibernating, any changes to the disk could corrupt the install and render your computer unusable. Therefore, hibernation is specifically designed NOT to allow you switch between OSes while one is hibernating.\nThat being said, see  https://superuser.com/questions/46299/is-it-possible-to-enable-hibernation-when-dual-booting-windows\nDepending on your setup you should be able to use your BIOS boot menu to switch between OSes when hibernating.\nThis relies on you having installed each OS on different physical drives.\n\nA: Answer:\nBecause you have Ubuntu installed using Wubi, unfortunately, you won't be able to choose which OS you want to boot if Windows is hibernated.\nExplanation:\nFrom the comments, it seems that you have Ubuntu installed using Wubi, which means that you installed Ubuntu inside Windows. This is because in the comments, you said \"Ubuntu is installed on partition H:\", which probably means that you can access this H: partition from your Windows OS and see a folder called \"Ubuntu\" inside it, correct? If yes, read on:\nWhen you restart your computer, it boots BOOTMGR by default, which is the Windows bootloader, and gives you the OS choice (Windows or Ubuntu). If you select Ubuntu, you go into GRUB. All good so far. However, the first thing BOOTMGR does (before giving you the OS choice) is it first checks if there is a hibernated OS. When it finds that Windows is hibernated, it directly boots into it, without giving you the options. This is what is happening on your machine. GRUB, on the other hand, does not do this.\nHow would you overcome this? By making GRUB the default bootloader (with Ubuntu and Windows as OS choices), not BOOTMGR. This, however, is in the case if Ubuntu is installed on a separate partition (a partition formatted in another format, ext4, that is not accessible through Windows). But because your Ubuntu is installed through Wubi, meaning that it's on the H: partition, meaning that it's on a Windows partition, this partition is part of the hibernated Windows! Get it =)? So we can't install GRUB as the default bootloader and ask it to boot Ubuntu from the hibernated partition, because then it will (I think) attempt to destroy the \"hibernated data\" and basically shutdown your Windows (and you lose all your unsaved data when you hibernated), then attempt to boot into Ubuntu. Get it now?\nSo in the end, unfortunately, I don't think it's feasible. Your solution would be to uninstall Ubuntu/Wubi, and install Ubuntu from scratch on a separate partition. This solution will uninstall Ubuntu/Wubi and will delete everything in your Ubuntu, so make sure you backup the files you need.\nAnother possible solution is to convert (migrate) your Wubi Ubuntu into a full, normal Ubuntu installation (put in on a separate partition). This way, it will copy over all your content, and you should find all your files the way they were (**although it is always advisable to backup your files whenever playing around with OSs). The steps to do this solution are detailed here: How to convert Wubi install into regular install? Here is a brief description of what you'll be doing:\n\n*\n\n*Boot into your Wubi Ubuntu.\n\n*Using gparted, create an empty partition big enough to house your Wubi Ubuntu (just make a partition as big as your H: partition, or as big as the \"Ubuntu\" folder). Choose ext4 as the filesystem type for the new partition.\n\n*Download the script from that question, and run sudo bash wubi-move.sh /dev/sdaX, where sdaX is your new partition you created in step 1 (\"X\" is a number, e.g. sda6. You can see the number of that new partition in gparted next to the partition).\n\nAgain, this is a brief description. Visit the question I linked and read the whole thing.\nHaving said all of this, my advised solution would be to:\n\n*\n\n*Backup everything you want from your Ubuntu.\n\n*Completely remove Ubuntu Wubi (How do I uninstall Wubi)\n\n*Install Ubuntu from scratch.\n\nIf your H partition was only meant for Ubuntu, then you can use that whole partition to install the new Ubuntu.\n\nA: I am answering the part of the question that deals with the issue \"I can't even resume Windows\". I was also having this problem... in a system with dual-boot installation of Windows 7 and Ubuntu (actually Linux Mint 17 64-bit!), I have a modern system (Gigabyte motherboard with UEFI bios) and can selectively boot the Windows boot manager, the GRUB loader, etc.\nWhen I hibernate my W7 session, no matter what I do, I cannot resume it. I always get\n\"Your computer cannot come out of hibernation\"\n\nand the error shown is code 0xC000009a. It doesn't matter if I choose the Windows boot loader from the BIOS boot menu, or use GRUB and select the Windows boot option; the end result is the same: I am forced to destroy the information from the suspended (hibernated) W7 session and boot \"fresh\" into Windows.\nResearching this a bit, especially by searching for that error message and the specific code, I found this solution, credit where it is due: http://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/307622-serious-error-0xc000009a.html and http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-boot-manager-your-computer-cant-come-out/a3170a6f-2962-45ac-8005-bde7abb35831\nApparently, the error code indicates an error relating to registry information in Windows. But, it appears there also may be some problem with the hiberfil.sys file that Windows uses to store the hibernated information. \nSO, the fixes suggested by both of these websites is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find your Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt item on the menu, right click it, and select Run As Administrator. Then, type the following command:\npowercfg -h off\n\n*Reboot your system (do NOT hibernate)... \n\n*when you are back in Windows again, repeat the running of Command Prompt with Administrator privilege as above (kinda like \"sudo\"), then type:\npowercfg -h on\n\n*test your fix by hibernating W7, then waking the machine up and (if you enter the GRUB loader due to your setup) choose to boot Windows 7. It should say \"Resuming Windows\"\nThis sequence of steps apparently clears up any corrupted hiberfil.sys AND any Registry \"misapprehensions\" about how your hibernation is set up. I don't have more technical detail as to why it works, but it does! I can now hibernate freely, and boot back into Windows 7 after hibernating, even using GRUB as the boot manager (but of course, selecting Windows boot).\nI changed my GRUB default to boot Windows after the timeout, so that restoring my hibernated sessions of W7 would be the most convenient for me. I use W7 more than Linux, but with the dual boot setup, I have the best of both worlds!\nThanks to every person out there who has brought us this wonderful free software called GNU/Linux!\n", "Q: Bind command lines to keys Is there a way to make this command line to activate every time i press a certain button?\nxdotool key XF86MonBrightnessDown\n\nI mean how can I bind it to a key?

The purpose of this is to prevent all users on the importing system from accessing those files (unless they have \"other\" permissions), as none of them (except root) can be/become nobody.\nTherefore it is a very bad idea to use nobody for any other purpose, because its purpose is to be a user name/user id for files that must not be accessible to anybody.\nThe Wiki entry is very wrong too.\nThe UNIX/Linux practice is to create a new account for each \"application\" or application area that needs a separate access control domain, and to never reuse nobody outside NFS.\n\nA: nobody is a special user and group account. Because it is an actual username (and groupname) and can be used by processes and even users, it is not literally nobody. For example, some Apache configurations have nobody as the user/group that owns the website files and directories. The problem comes when multiple processes might use the nobody user, such as NFS directories and the webserver. \n\nA: \nIn many Unix variants, \"nobody\" is the conventional name of a user\n  account which owns no files, is in no privileged groups, and has no\n  abilities except those which every other user has.\nIt is common to run daemons as nobody, especially servers, in order to\n  limit the damage that could be done by a malicious user who gained\n  control of them.

It's usually reserved for vulnerable services (httpd, etc) so that if they get hacked, they'll have minimal damage on the rest of the system.\nContrast this with running something as a real user, if that service were compromised (web servers are occasionally exploited to run arbitrary code), it would run as that user and have access to everything that user had.

This relates to learning RubyOnRails which I believe is often installed on or with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Necessary? Certainly not. You can replace your laptop's operating system with Ubuntu and that works well for a lot of people.\nBut if you're happy with your existing operating system and just want Ubuntu for testing a Rails stack, virtualisation offers a quick, easy and non-permanent method for getting going.\nThere are even pre-built \"virtual appliance\" images for testing Ruby which might be the quickest way to get developing but I would strongly advise against pushing these to production.\n", "Q: Count FTP/User logins I managed to assign multiple FTP accouts to the same folder on the server over web interface, but I also want to track them.

Alt+Tab`ing between windows is smooth and multitasking is awesome.\nBut then I run Ubuntu and get none of this. Alt+tab takes a second to appear on the screen, programs launch a bit slow for the first time, faster afterwards though. Switching between open programs feels slow. Not too slow, but not fast either, while I have enough specs to have it fast. I have read a bunch of guides on how to improve the overall performance (like switching to old Unity 2D and using \"preload\" tool), tried some of it but never achieved similar multitasking performance comparing to Windows.\nAm I doing something wrong? Or is it just how Ubuntu is?

Was interested to know why, with space/bandwidth at such a premium, is full compression not used during squash.\nFor example, calling mksquashfs with the -comp xz -b 1M options at compression time creates an archive which weighs in at about 80% of the original filesystem.squashfs; yet appears to retain full integrity as both an installation and live image.\nDoes anybody have some intel here?\n\nA: Presumably because xz (LZMA) compression requires disproportionately more CPU time for both compression and decompression, something that does make a difference when loading the system from a live USB stick, for instance. See a wider discussion of xz vs gzip on Stack Overflow.\nIn a similar vein, there is an open blueprint for using xz to compress packages in the Ubuntu archive.

Everything going fine. Gave me options how to install. \n\n*Chose \"Other\" as I have multiple drives. Gave me the option which drive to use.\n\n*Screen came up with all my drives and the partitions on each. (PS It would be REALLY useful if drive letters were included in the list!)\n\n*Highlighted the drive/partition I wanted to use: /dev/sdc2\n\n*Screen showed \"Device for boot loader installation: /dev/sdc2 (So far, so good - I think)\n\n*Clicked on \"Install Now\" and get the message \"No root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu\". BUT, doesn't tell me where the partitioning menu is! I double clicked on the drive/partition I want to use, and a small \"Edit Partition\" window opens. I assume this IS the partitioning menu.\n\n*Allows me to change the size of the partition (it should already be big enough).\n\"Use as\" I had set up as NTFS (There were 10 choices to pick from. From some of the comments on here it sounds like I should be using ext4. Is that right?\nNext line is a checkbox with \"Format the partition\". Didn't do that. It's a new partition. \n\n*Next line \"Mount Point\" I put /dos. Again from other comments on here it looks like I should be using / - right?\n\n\nIf I change the above to ext4 and / will it continue to install? Don't know what else to expect after this?\n\nA: In Short\nchoose ext4 as file system (it's modern and ubuntu's default) and select the hard drive you want and set it up for \"/\". Be aware that you should back up all your data on this disk first, since it will be deleted (formatted).\nExplanation\next 4 is modern, stable and ubuntu's default so this is a clear recommendation. Ths Sign \"/\" is called \"root\". It's basically a folder, like c:\\ in Windows. As you maybe know, paths of files in linux look like this:\n/home/user/Desktop/example.txt or\n/bin/bash\nand this is why / (only the first sign) is called root. Because every file path begins with it. It's like the main folder that kind of has no name (obviously: \"/\"), so it's just called root.\nChoosing \"/\" for this hard drive means that this hard drive will contain every folder of your file system, except the ones you want to have on other hard drives. You could for example choose another hard drive and say \"be my /home/ folder\". This way you can split up and customize your Ubuntu to work with many hard drives or SSDs to speed up your computer for example.\nWell, and to show where the \"c:\\\" equivalent \"/\" should be, you have to assign it to a disk. To show where to install linux, kind of.\n\nA: There are two issues here: partitioning and boot device\nPartitioning\nUbuntu needs a minimum of two partitions to work well: a root partition (labelled /) and a swap partition.\nThe way to change partitions in your case depends a lot on what you already have.\nYou can have only four primary partitions but you can have many logical partitions.\nSo, if you do not have four partitions on your disk, after choosing \"something else\" during installation, reduce the size of you largest partition to create free space. Then create two new partitions: a big one (10 Gb is a rough practical minimum) for your root partition. So choose / as mount point and a small swap partition (2-4 Gb).\nP.S. Drive letters is something Windows arbitrarily assigns to partitions so the installation cannot guess them. Furthermore Linux doesn't use drive letters. Your first hard disk will probably be /dev/sda the second drive /dev/sdb, etc.\nBoot device\nThe boot device you should choose is /dev/sda (your primary hard disk) and not /dev/sdaX.\n", "Q: Help I broke terminal I tried the below \"tip\" trying to learn different things I could do with terminal and it does not work.

The error was \n\nbash: cd: sda5: Not a directory\n\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: You need to make it mounted in somewhere. The device is there but you have no access to it to achieve this you must use the mount command. First create a mounting point as:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/shared\n\nThen you can mount the sda5 to it:\nsudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda5 /mnt/shared\n\nNow, your files should be in /mnt/shared:\ncd /mnt/shared\n\nI don't encourage you to do so cause it can harm files having different end line encodings in windows / linux. What I suggest you is to create another partition and move the files you want to use on both systems there. Then stick with a multi OS IDE.\n\nA: You need to mount the partition.\nCreate a directory where you want to mount it. mkdir ~/programCode\nThen mount the partition there sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda5 ~/programCode\ncd ~/programCode and you files should be there\n", "Q: I want to format the hard drive and create partitions myself I have fubuntu installed on a laptop and want to replace it with the newest ubuntu.\nI want to be able to create my own partitions during the install.

It will shrink a dynamically allocated image, reduce the physical size of the VDI.\nYou need to use the --resize option to change the capacity of an existing VDI image. However, this works with dynamically allocated disk ONLY, and it is capable to expand ONLY, not shrink.\nSee => VBoxManage modifyhd\n\nA: If you want to change the displayed size inside Ubuntu, you have no option except copying the partition to a smaller virtual disk.

My browser updated yesterday and today I've noticed that the option to turn off JavaScript is no longer there. Did they relocate it somewhere?

As the bug report linked by edwin notes, this was a controversial change.\nYou can blanket disable javascript by going to page about:config and setting the key javascript.enabled to false.\nHowever, if you want to block javascript an extension like NoScript which gives you fine grained control over which scripts run is a better choice.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.10 updates fail This is what I get. should I uninstall/reinstall Ubuntu?
