Having said that, you can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using dpkg to remove older kernels and install the new one after. For example: \n$ sudo dpkg -r linux-headers-3.5.0-28-generic\n\n\n*If it still does not work, you can try to move temporarily some older kernel files to a different location (root partition, some pen drive, etc...), install the new kernel and then remove older kernels, while moving the kernel files to their default location;\n\n*You can try to \"move\" your /boot mount point temporarily (supposing you have sufficient space on /). This will take the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount your /boot mount point: sudo umount /boot;\n\n*Mount it anywhere else: sudo mount /dev/**your boot partition** /mnt;\n\n*Move your files from /mnt to /boot: you can use gksu nautilus or sudo mv to do that\n\n*Perform the changes you want (installing the new kernel, removing the old ones);\n\n*Copy the files from /mnt back to /boot;\n\n\n\nAlso note that if you are using LVM, resizing a partition is a lot easier (you dont even need to stop anything/reboot/use live cd's). So if this is the case just use lvextend to increase the space on /boot partition.\n\nA: I'm sure that if you do a df -h you will notice your /boot partition full.\n\nbraiam@bt:~$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda7        14G  9.8G  3.3G  76% /\n/dev/sda5       922M   40M  819M   5% /boot\n\nThis happens because you made it too small, or you smashed there several kernels that you don't need, or you just filled it with unicorns background for the Grub... either way, it has 2 simple solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall obsolete kernels.\nsudo apt-get -y autoremove\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\n*Make your /boot partition bigger.\nThis requires that you boot into a Live OS then resize the partition.\n", "Q: No network device available OUTPUT - sudo lshw -C network\n\n*-network               \n\n\ndescription: Network controller\n\nproduct: BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN\n\nvendor: Broadcom Corporation\n\nphysical id: 0\n\nbus info: pci@0000:0b:00.0\n\nversion: 01\n\nwidth: 32 bits\n\nclock: 33MHz\n\ncapabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list\n\nconfiguration: driver=wl latency=0\n\nresources: irq:16 memory:efcfc000-efcfffff\n\n\n*-network UNCLAIMED\n\n\ndescription: Ethernet controller\n\nproduct: BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX\n\nvendor: Broadcom Corporation\n\nphysical id: 0\n\nbus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n\nversion: 02\n\nwidth: 32 bits\n\nclock: 33MHz\n\ncapabilities: pm bus_master cap_list\n\nconfiguration: latency=64\n\nresources: memory:ef9fe000-ef9fffff\n\n\nOUTPUT - ifconfig -a\n\n\nlo        \nLink encap:Local Loopback  \n\ninet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n\ninet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n\nUP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n\nRX packets:259 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n\nTX packets:259 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n\ncollisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:33926 (33.9 KB)  \nTX bytes:33926 (33.9 KB)\n\nContent of path - etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\n\n# PCI device 0x14e4:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:03:00.0/ssb1:0 (b44)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"00:19:b9:5a:f6:eb\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\nOUTPUT - sudo ifconfig eth0\n\n    eth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device\n\nOUTPUT - sudo ifup eth0\n\n    Ignoring unknown interface eth0=eth0.\n\n\n\nA: Please open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nHook up the ethernet temporarily and do:\nsudo modprobe b44\n\nNow your ethernet should be working and able to connect.

I'm running on OS X so, if I download and install Ubuntu and I start using Ubuntu, but for some reason I want to use OSX for a while to see something, can I change to OSX and then go back to Ubuntu?? \n\nA: Replacing one operating system with another\nYES, there is no reason why you can't install over your Ubuntu with OS X and visa versa as many times as you like.\nUsing more than one operating system on the same computer\nInstalling 2 operating systems on the same computer is called \"dual-booting\" (or \"multi-booting\"). It depends on how you do the installation (it's a slightly different process with OSX and Ubuntu than it is with Windows and Ubuntu), but here again, the answer is YES.\n", "Q: Where to find and how to use Ubuntu's version of Windows's Run dialog? I'm switching over from Windows to Ubuntu, and I want to know how to get the functionality of Windows Run dialog in Ubuntu. \nIn Windows, I just go to the Start button, and enter in the search field run, and the Run dialog pops up. I mainly use this program to connect to servers in my network by typing \\\\ + the name of the server.\n\nHow do I replicate this functionality in Ubuntu? Do I use the command line? I've read elsewhere about an old GNOME program called \"Run\" that I can get by installing the Compizconfig Settings Manager, but I don't know if this is what I want.\n\nA: You can check this website out for a starter,\n\n1) Terminal\n2) Command Line\n  Resources\n3) Useful commands in\n  Ubuntu\n\nThank you @ignis @almel\n\nA: I believe that the equivalent of windows \"Run\" dialog is Alt+F2.\nIn most Linux systems this will popup a dialog waiting for a command.\nIn the latest versions of Ubuntu, the Dash will open asking you for a command to run.\nOf course, you can use a terminal for commands as well. You can open one using Ctrl+Alt+T.\nI believe that things like the run dialog in Windows and Alt+F2 in Linux exist as GUI replacements of the terminal, for simple commands that do not have their own desktop launcher in Windows or desktop file in Linux.\n\nA: At the risk of hijacking this thread, and since I am not yet allowed to comment on the above answer, I will expand on this question here.\nIMHO, Dash does not replicate the function of the Windows Run dialog.   In particular, if I don't know which application to use with a particular file type, I can enter a file specification in the Windows Run dialog, and windows will (usually) open the file in the appropriate application.   Also, if I enter a directory path in the Windows Run dialog, Windows will display that directory in Explorer.  How can I best accomplish such tasks in Linux (Ubuntu)?\nP.S.  Since this is billed as an answer, I can at least add one answer which I have found for the first task mentioned above (thanks to this thread).\n It isn't quite as convenient as the Windows Run dialog, however:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window (e.g. by typing Ctrl-Alt-T)\n\n*At the command prompt, type:\nxdg-open <filespec>\n\n\n*The file specified in <filespec> should open in the appropriate application.\n\n", "Q: no wireless on aspire one d257 ubuntu 12.04 I´m lost in wireless Connection.\nAfter Installation of ubuntu, there is no wireless driver availalble (\"wireless\" not appearing in the menue).

The Workspace and raid volumes were setup using LVM and MDADM under Webmin and formatted with EXT4.\nI reinstalled Ubuntu 13.04 onto the same system, deleting the root and swap partitions first. Now when I attempt to mount the volumes under Webmin it fails with the error:\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mapper/ubuntux64--vg-Workspace,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\nLooking at dmesg it shows the error:\nEXT2-fs (dm-0) error couldn't mount because of supported optional features\n\nThe volume is formatted as EXT4 so not sure why it is defaulting to EXT2.

I recommend you look at your /etc/fstab file. There may be an entry in there that misidentifies the filesystem type; or if there's no /etc/fstab entry for the problem volume, you can create one that explicitly identifies it as ext4fs.\n", "Q: ubuntu installation replacing of windows 7 without partitioning I have already 5 drives in my PC.

How can i change from mongodb user to mydesiredusername?\n\nA: If you're running mongodb as a service, you would need to edit the upstart configuration file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/init/mongodb.conf.\n\n*Change the argument --chuid mongodb to --chuid mydesiredusername. If you need to specify a group, use --chuid mydesiredusername:mydesiredgroup.\n\n*Restart by running sudo restart mongodb.\n\n\nYou might also need to change the ownership of your database files (in /var/lib/mongodb unless you have changed that as well) and the /var/log/mongodb directory and its contents so that mongodb can still read and write to its files.\nYou don't explain why you want to make this change, so maybe you have a good reason. But I would suggest keeping to the default user and finding an alternative solution to the problem you are trying to solve. Services run as their own user for good reasons, not least for security. Changing something like this can cause unexpected problems in the future, make upgrades harder, and is also confusing if other people need to administer your server at a later date.\n", "Q: No sound via headphones with Ubuntu 13.04 HI have looked through some similar questions, but none of the answers I've tried have helped me.

I expect a fresh install will trim it down, but they do grow, with added applications and updates etc.  So which bits of the system need to be on the SSD, and which can I move to the HD to leave some free space for the future?  Which of the various directories does the system need fast access to, and which could be slow without noticeably slowing down the system?\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: You could probably save a significant amount of space in the long by moving/symlinking /var/cache/apt to your hard drive; that folder can grow quite large if you don't sudo apt-get clean it periodically. \nOtherwise, I wouldn't offload anything else from the SSD. Most of the growth I've seen (aside from newly-installed programs) is from cached package files. \n", "Q: Synchronise clocks on ubuntu running in EC2? I've got three servers running on AWS EC2 using official Ubuntu AMIs using paravirtualisation. I have noticed their clocks are out of sync by about a minute.\nNTP is not installed by default in the official AMIs. Apparently NTP will not function correctly on VMs. Apparently you don't need to syncronise clocks, because the VM should use the same clock as DOM0, i.e. the host machine. Presumably AWS run NTP on their host machines.\nOn the other hand there are plenty of blogs telling you to run NTP and disable host clock syncronisation by running echo 1 > /proc/sys/xen/independent_wallclock. However in the official AMIs there is not /proc/sys/xen - there is /proc/xen, but it is empty.\nDoes anyone know how to synchronise clocks on ubuntu running in EC2?\n\nA: I contacted Amazon about this, they said that it's safe to install NTP and that you shouldn't have to disable the xen wallclock. They said that NTP is a good solution for EC2 instances. \nAmazon have dedicated NTP servers which should be added to /etc/ntp.conf:\nserver 0.amazon.pool.ntp.org\nserver 1.amazon.pool.ntp.org\nserver 2.amazon.pool.ntp.org\nserver 3.amazon.pool.ntp.org\n\nSo it's probably best to install NTP as described in the docs:\nsudo apt-get install ntp\n\n", "Q: How do you login into /bin/bash automatically? Im on 12.04 LTS and am doing to Ruby on Rails development. When I start up my terminal and type in ruby -v it will list my Ruby as 1.8.7.

Problem is that I have to type in /bin/bash --login everytime I start up my terminal. Is there a way that I can log into /bin/bash automatically when I open up my terminal?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the terminal\n\n*From menu-bar, select Edit > Profiles\n\n*In opened prompt Edit > Default\n\n*In Tab \"Title & Commands\" -> check \"Run Command as Login Shell\"\n\n*Restart Terminal\n\n\nNow you need not to run /bin/bash --login again .\n\nA: Technically, RVM is loaded into your shell session as a function. If you're using Bash as your shell, this integration is done by the config file .bash_profile. As you might know, there are different \"types\" of shell sessions, namely login shells, interactive shells and non-interactive shells. Depending on which of that your bash session is, different config files get involved. The .bash_profile config file, that handles the integration of RVM, is included with login shell sessions, but not with \"merely\" interactive or non-interactive shell sessions. For more details, you can read up in the RVM docs.\nSo you need to make sure that when you start up your terminal, the shell session is started as a login shell session. There probably is a setting with your terminal emulator for this. With the command /bin/bash --login that you used so far, you do nothing other than start another shell session inside your shell session, but this one as a login shell.\nYou probably have installed Ruby by the package manager (apt-get) in addition to installing it via RVM. So when RVM isn't integrated to your shell session, you're left with the \"system Ruby\". That's why you kind of \"fall back\" to Ruby 1.8.7.\n\nA: Solution which works for me is to add following line to your .bashrc file:\n[[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 doesn't automount razr d1 mtp My Ubuntu 13.04 is not auto-mounting my Motorola Razr D1.

Not sure what to do with that but I am open to other ideas and other software. Any ideas on what to do next? Would Unetbootin work?\n\nA: First make sure that you have Gparted, and Ntfs-3g installed, and P7zip.  \nIf not, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-full\n\nOnce the installation is done, download and install UNetbootin for Linux.  For all the steps, follow the images below. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou run UNetbootin, by double clicking on it, but before you run it, right click on the file, and follow steps outlined by the images below.\n\n\nMake sure that you have the Windows ISO available, and follow the steps outlined in the image below.\n\nOnce done, make sure that your system is set to boot from USB, insert the USB to boot from it, and reboot your machine.\n\nA: I figured out how to fix the freezing part. It now is officially extracted to the USB using UNetbootin. When I restart the computer and startup with the USB it shows a title saying UNetbootin and a box for choices of startup. I then choose Default because that's the only choice. It also says: Automatic boot in 10 seconds... and counts down. I click Enter on Default and it restarts the timer. When the timer gets to 0 it restarts. Any idea? Also the USB doesn't mount itself. I have to manually mount it every time it's unplugged or I restart my PC.\n\nA: If you have a blank USB drive (this will wipe out anything that may be on it) you can simply do:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/windows_install.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M; sync\n\nWhere you need to replace the X /dev/sdX with the identifier of your USB stick, this will be a letter such as a, b, c, d, etc. It will not have a number on it, if you have an identifier such as /dev/sdc1, that means there is a partition (possibly with data on it) on that device that will be destroyed with the above command.\n", "Q: brand new L75D-A7280 battery reports 95% max when plugged in, 93% immediately after unplugged Whenever my brand new laptop's plugged in, it reports 95% max.

It still has not moved on past /var/lib.\nThe main errors in testdisk.log look like these:\nCan't create file /media/ubuntu/Recovery/var/lib/dpkg/info/libtasn1-3:i386.shlibs/urandom/X11/pt/man5/netcat.1.gz/ncurses-bin/.Greek-TerminusBold20x10.psf.gz.Ct4hLl/Greek-Terminus22x11.psf.gz/PT154.so/lib/Blk/Suppleme.pl.dpkg-new/mmu.h.dpkg-new: Not a directory\nCan't create file /media/ubuntu/Recovery/var/lib/dpkg/info/libtasn1-3:i386.shlibs/urandom/X11/pt/man5/netcat.1.gz/ncurses-bin/.Greek-TerminusBold20x10.psf.gz.Ct4hLl/Greek-Terminus22x11.psf.gz/PT154.so/lib/Blk/Suppleme.pl.dpkg-new/dma-mapping.h.dpkg-new: Not a directory\n\n...\nCan't create file /media/ubuntu/Recovery/var/lib/dpkg/info/libtasn1-3:i386.shlibs/urandom/X11/ja/tzdata.postrm/powerpc/include/asm.dpkg-new/scatterlist.h.dpkg-new/home/richie/.icedtea/cache/2/http/arcanists14.jagex.com/74/Microsoft.NET/50/partial-i386/usr/share/zoneinfo/right/America/Tortola: Is a directory\n\nOr these:\next2fs_read_inode(ino=825254982) failed with error 2133571369.\next2fs_read_inode(ino=825254969) failed with error 2133571369.\next2fs_read_inode(ino=825254982) failed with error 2133571369.\next2fs_read_inode(ino=825254982) failed with error 2133571369.\next2fs_read_inode(ino=825254982) failed with error 2133571369.\next2fs_read_inode(ino=825254969) failed with error 2133571369.\n\nMy question, though, boils down to this: Is it normal to be seeing as many as 22 million files in the filesystem as a normal Linux user?\n\nA: Certainly not; my current system has under half a million.  I'd say testdisk is wasting your time.\n", "Q: Moving Shotwell from 12.04 LTS to 13.04 I was using Shotwell on an old computer running 12.04 LTS.  Not sure what the Shotwell version was [I've looked since, and it's 0.12.3], but it would have been up-to-date for that OS version.  Got a new computer running 13.04 and Shotwell 0.14.1; copied Pictures folder to new computer; copied ~/.shotwell to ~/.local/share/shotwell.  It kept all the tags and the images are there but the images don't match the tags (or vice versa) and the images are mostly all distorted like Shotwell is retaining the orientation and/or resolution for the wrong photo.\nSo, the question is:  Is there a way to get the right tags matched back up with the right photos, etc., so that everything is back like it was?  Or do I just have to delete the photo.db, let Shotwell re-index everything and start over retagging everything? (sigh)\nShotwell did give me an import log, which pointed out a number of duplicate directories that I'll be able to easily clean up.  Nice.\n\nA: Jim Nelson responded to my post on yorba which resolved this. My guess is that my not deleting the cache after the first attempt is why I couldn't get any further.\n\nA: \ncopied  ~/.shotwell to ~/.local/share/shotwell.\n\nI would have thought that you should copy ~/.shotwell to ~/.shotwell.  If shotwell has an upgrade mechanism, finding its data in the \"old\" directory and not the new might trigger its upgrade mechanism and do any necessary conversion.\nIt's worth a try, at least.  I must admit to not knowing much about shotwell.\n", "Q: Send transactional emails from ubuntu server 12.04 LTS in intranet I have a CakePHP web app running on a ubuntu  12.04 LTS server. The server is hosted on a machine within a intranet of a corporation.\nThe web app needs to send out transactional emails a few times a day. \nAccording to SendGrid, emails are largely divided into 2 types: marketing and transactional.\nTransactional emails are those that notify you something has happened/ is about to happen. \nRecipients of this email are usually advised not to reply back.\nBecause this web app I am doing is mainly for internal usage and therefore the emails sent to internal corporate users, I do not envisage the need to set up SPF for emails and so on.\nHowever, I am not sure how to install an email server in ubuntu 12.04 that will work with my CakePHP web app.\nI do know that my web app works with GMAIL SMTP settings.\nAll I need to do is to use the following in my CakePHP email settings:\npublic $gmail = array(\n        'host' => 'ssl://smtp.gmail.com',\n        'port' => 465,\n        'username' => 'some_user@gmail.com',\n        'password' => 'secret_password',\n        'transport' => 'Smtp'\n    );\n\nI believe I can use postfix, but I have never installed it before. Need advice on exactly what steps I need to undertake to achieve the above.\nOff the top of my head I think I at least need to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*how to install email server\n\n*configuration for the email server\n\n*how to create an account on the email server (e.g. noreply@IP_ADDRESS?? )\n\n*SMTP configuration for my web app to send out the email \n\n\nBoth the web app and the email server are on the same machine. \nAnother key point to add is that the machine has no direct access to the internet. It is purely on the corporate intranet.\n\nA: I would install sendmail, if you need just the basic functionality.\nBut if you don't need MTA, why would install one? Production server bloating with vulnerable software is really hitting your own leg at the end.\nBut if you like, just install sendmail and voilá, your mail is delivered with php mail function. You don't need to create user for it, just use address you want.\n", "Q: When I install Ubuntu it takes long in the preparing to download, what can I do? I tried to install Ubuntu, and it takes a long time in the preparing to install the screen, and I don't know what to do, please help? The reason I'm installing it is because my computer fails to start to windows 7 and the only way I can use it is with Ubuntu, so now I'm stuck with using it on the try Ubuntu. I need to install it, but it takes long as I said before I press continue and it takes a long time to go to the next part so I don't know what to do. what can I do? I'm using Ubuntu (try) right now.\n\nA: Normally, whenever you download updates it takes a very looong time. Because you are downloading several megabytes of updates (some of them seems stuck, but it's doing it work). If you don't have a fast internet, either wait or don't use Update at install option. Is reported that if you unplug/disconnect every network the installation will continue without problems.\n", "Q: How do I change the keyboard shortcuts for the Window Manager in Xubuntu 13.04? I'd like to change my Alternate Desktop shortcut in Xubuntu. How do I do that? I don't see the option under Keyboard's Application Shortcuts?\n\nA: Xubuntu 13.04 has two different sets of keyboard shortcuts,\n\n\n*\n\n*Application Shortcuts\n\n*Window Manager → Keyboard (shortcuts)\n\n\nYou're simply in the wrong screen. Close out of Application Shortcuts, that's for starting an application with a keyboard shortcut. What you want is to go under Settings → Window Manager → Keyboard. Then you should be able to set new keyboard shortcuts.\n", "Q: Deleting Ubuntu I have tried to format the hard drive but I can't!\nI have tried to use the Disk Management option that says format, but it won't let me as it says it's busy. I can't install Windows as the hard drive is in the wrong format.\nHelp, please.\n\nA: Try booting computer with Windows disc and format the drive in setup.\n", "Q: Android local and remote file access I have 4 nexus 10 Tablets, and 3 Android phones. I would like to be able to back them up (locally for speed), and pull files from the back up from anywhere (over cellular data connection). What type of server/s would I use and how would I go about setting it up. I did a bunch of looking around and have no idea what direction to go.\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: Simply speaking, you can setup a SFTP/SSH server in a Ubuntu machine. Then, you need to open a port(default port 22 for ssh service, can be changed to other port) on the router so that it can direct all external calls to your server. Record the public IP granted by the router.\nOn your SFTP server, you need to create an special account which will be used for login by remote machines(the mobile devices). Apply some constraints on this account so that people using this can only access the folders and files kept by it but not other things.\nOn the clients side (your mobile devices), you may install a file manager such as ES File Explorer which can act as a sftp client. Use the IP and the sftp account created previously to access your server.\n\nA: You might want to have a look at git-annex which are used for syncronize files between different machines, servers and cloud storages.\nIt works with Android, MS Windows and Linux/Unix machines. There are no client for iOS devices. \nNotice that it isn't a backup solution, it's a synchronisation tool. Look at pub for a backup tool based on git.\n", "Q: Wine will not use my GPU I have an AMD A8 CPU/APU running with an ATI 6670 (or something like that). I have turned off the integrated graphics card and I am just running with the 6670. The thing is I have installed Steam via Wine so I can play my games that aren't supported by the Linux version. I downloaded Counter Strike Global Offensive to play and I get an error message saying:\nYour graphics hardware does not support all features (CSM) needed to run this game.\n\nThe part that gets me is that the \"driver name\" is my ATI Radeon HD 3200 which is my APU. I do not know how to get around this.\nI am currently installing legacy drivers to see if that helps.\n\nA: Try installing bumblebee\nPost that, start the bumblebee server.\nLaunch the application using optirun\n\"optirun wine app.exe\"\nWorked for me.

For security reasons, files in the DocumentRoot hierarchy aren't ever processed (ie executed) - and files in the ScriptAlias directory are never served statically.\nYou need to separate out your executable content (perl, php, sh) from your statically served content (html files, images, css, js) - so that the webserver knows that files in 'this' directory and below don't need to be processed (such as images), and files in that directory do.\nTo this end:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an index.html file with meta headers that redirect to /cgi-bin/index.pl, and put the index.html in the DocumentRoot\n\n*Move your index.pl to a directory pointed to by ScriptAlias (with a corresponding Directory section - which has +ExecCGI flag). Ensure the index.pl is executable, and ensure that its shebang line points to a resolvable perl. \n\n\nThe html output of your index.pl can still reference images etc from the root (e.g. put an images folder in your document root folder and reference images from html as /images/logo.png) , and scripts can be linked to (via form submission or href) from your html content from the script folder (e.g. as /cgi-bin/processform.pl)\n", "Q: Turn old boot disk into secondary drive without losing data I have a 2TB drive with XBMCBuntu 12.04.3 installed on it and also about 1.5TB of data.I have a new, small HDD (40GB) and want to install the OS on it.\nI would like to keep the data on the HDD but just turn it into a data drive.

I want to run a couple of Windows and Linux guests so did some research and it looked like KVM was the way to go.\nKVM is a bit confusing, documentation refers to KVM and QEMU often interchangeably. I had been using Webmin and came across the Cloudmin management tools to control KVM and they seemed pretty good. They also had an install script which seemed to simplify things so I went that way.\nRan the script, it installed KVM and Cloudmin and attempted to setup bridging but made a bit of a mess of the interfaces file which I easily sorted out.

It a cross-platform video editor translated in many languages whose developpment is led by Dan Dennedy former developper for Kdenlive. It's really simple to use with a drag n drop concept, filters (text, video, audio) and you get great results very quickly. one thing that stands out is, that there's no need to \"import\" clips into a project just like you do with Kdenlive and Openshot.

How can I do\nsu goofy\nssh goofy.com \n\nin one line?\n\nA: Because su  goofy opens a new session, but the && ssh goofy.com will go to the original. So the && ssh goofy.com command is executed under the original, not su-ed user.  \nTry in one line like this: sudo -u goofy -H sh -c \"ssh goofy.com\" \n\nA: A few reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you just mean to ssh as another user remotely, specify a username:\nssh goofy@server\n# or \nssh -u goofy server\n\n\n*If you need to change user locally and then run ssh as that user, use su correctly. su forks out into its own session so commands you tail it with will run after it ends. You could translate your command to:\n\nTurn into goofy and after I'm done there (and assuming it worked), run ssh.\n\nLook at the -c/--command argument of su (run man su for the manual) or look at the sudo command which has a more logical syntax in my opinion.

Hello I am a Windows 7 user and I am planning to replace it by Ubuntu. I have three drives and windows 7 is installed in drive C. I just want to know that weather all my drives will be formatted while replacing it with Ubuntu or only C drive (where my Windows 7 is currently installed)?\n\nA: Yes, if you choose the Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu option, all of your hard disk (all of your partitions) will be completely formatted and deleted, and new partitions will be created for Ubuntu.\nIf you wish to delete only the C drive (where Windows is installed), and install Ubuntu there, you'll need to choose the Something Else option, and give the C drive a mount point of /.\nFor more information on the Something Else option, see this question: \"Install alongside\" option missing. How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using \"Something Else\"?\n\nA: To replace Windows with Ubuntu, once you get to the Installation Type screen, you would choose Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu, or Something else\n\nChoosing Something else, will give you the option to choose the partition that you want to use.  Keep in mind that Ubuntu lists drives different than windows.  So C drive would be Sda would be the first physical drive, Sda1 would be the first partition on the first physical drive, Sda2 would be the second partition on the first physical drive, ans so on.  Sdb would be the second physical drive, Sdc would be the third physical drive, and so on.  So in your case C drive (providing that you have one partition on it) would be Sda, now if you only have one physical drive with multiple partitions, then your C drive would be Sda1.  Once you determine the right drive, you would delete the partition, and create 2 Ubuntu partitions.  A partition mounted as /, and a Swap partition.\n\n\n\nA: Its actually depends upon where you are installing and how are you installing.\nfor example \nIn the above image if you choose 1st option it will install the Ubuntu and windows 7 with out any modifications to your system by choosing a safe automatic partition process with 100% success rate.\nIf you choose the 2nd option then your windows partition will be formatted and Ubuntu will use that partition for the installation.I mean your windows will lost.\nIf you choose the 3rd option then there you can specify the partition manually. so you can give a specific drive for Ubuntu installation.\nusually 90% of the users will give the 3rd choice. \nnow choice is up to you.\n", "Q: Using if an AWK command I have a file which contains many

I have an epson cx3650 and open office but this only saves in .odg which is not recognised in such things a facebook and other programmes.\n\nA: well you can do that with an application named as xsane. To install that open your terminal and type as\nsudo apt-get install xsane\n\nThen open that from unity dash. there you can do.\none more thing is after you save the images in your default format of scanner , you can re-save them into desired format by using Gimp which is also can be installable from your terminal with\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nhope that helps.\n\nA: You can use 'convert' as part of 'imagemagick'\nconvert file.odg file.jpg\n\nSee here for more details.\nUPDATE: Actually imagemagick fails for me, so I would recommend opening the image in OpenOffice Draw, then exporting as a PDF. Then use imagemagick to convert from PDF to JPG.\nconvert file.pdf file.jpg\n\n\nA: Open the .odg file in Open Office and then click File->Export.  \n\n\n*\n\n*On the Export dialog box that opens, provide your desired filename, \n\n*then find the \"Save as type:\" selection,\n\n*Select the file type: JPEG (.jpg ...), and then click Save.  \n\n*On the small dialoge box that opens, specify your desired quality setting (100 is \"best\").\n\n*Click OK to complete the Export operation.\n\n\nThe original .odg file will still be open in Open Office. You can close Open Office, and then view/edit/use your newly created .jpg file in other programs and applications, and on web sites like Facebook.\nDepending on the content that is being scanned (photo, drawing, text, etc...), it might be a better choice to save the file in another standard format like .png. The process would be similar to exporting to .jpg (.png will have a \"Compression\" setting [0=none/minimum to 9=maximum compression] instead of a \"Quality\" setting).\n\nA: there is one more application named as simplescan. you can install it from terminal with \n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:robert-ancell/simple-scan\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install simple-scan\n\n", "Q: The state of partitioning tools? What is the state of partitioning tools in Linux? Which tools are recommend and which should I stay away from? Namely I am interested in fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk and the fdisk and cfdisk variants that come in the gnu-fdisk package. The \"go to\" solution these days would be parted I assume?\nI am asking this because I used to use cfdisk years ago, but now I am sitting here with a new 3TB disk and cfdisk is displaying completely wrong information, it's displaying a partition as 375GB in size and free space available even so there is a single partition of 3TB and no free space. If I switch over to cfdisk from the gnu-fdisk package, it will display correct information, but now fdisk.gnu-fdisk won't display anything. Meanwhile the regular fdisk that comes by default with Ubuntu would display things correctly. sfdisk seems to work, but is lacking support for the newer GPT partition tables.\nEssentially half of those tools don't seem to work properly. So should I just forget them and do everything with parted from now on? Are the gdisk tools ready for prime time or are there any drawbacks to using GPT? Are there other tools I should be aware of? \n\nA: For working with GPT disks, you need either something based on libparted (parted, GParted, etc.) or my GPT fdisk (gdisk, sgdisk, and cgdisk) tools. The latter come in the Ubuntu gdisk package, IIRC. Since you say you're familiar with cfdisk, I recommend you check out cgdisk, since the latter is modeled after the former, but for GPT disks.\nPersonally, I'd avoid the GNU fdisk package; it's an attempt to slap an fdisk-like user interface atop libparted, but the result is something that omits the functionality that makes fdisk worthwhile to begin with.\nEdit (March, 2017):\nThe older fdisk and related tools (sfdisk and cfdisk) now support GPT, too. IIRC, Ubuntu 14.10 or 15.04 was the first version of Ubuntu to ship with the updated tools, so you should have those unless you're running an older distribution. The last I checked, my GPT fdisk provided more comprehensive support for GPT-specific features, but fdisk and its brethren should be fine for most day-to-day operations.\n\nA: Factory state / blank reset\nIf having trouble with HDD partitioning, one thing I found helpful was to create a bootable disk of:\n\n*\n\n*http://killdisk.com/bootdisk.htm\n(there's a free version at that website)\n\n*\n\n*there is some other functionality on the bootable ISO, but I didn't need them\n\n\n*this helped me reset the HDD to an utterly blank factory state & begin from scratch\n\n\n*particularly helpful when it has been the bootable disk for a windows machine before then being used for Linux, or where for some other reason the disk wasn't being properly recognized by an operating system installation CD.\nHowever in one case (not sure why) I had to then deal with removing a GPT partition table, but that was a comparatively easier task (explained in the link below):\n\n*\n\n*How to remove GPT from HDD?\nNot sure if this is what you're after ... but perhaps it helps\nSEE COMMENTS BELOW ON WARNING REGARDING REMOVAL OF GPT ON LARGE DRIVES\n\n*\n\n*thanks Rod ! :-)\n\n", "Q: grub rescue when trying to fix dualboot with Windows 8, what can I do?

http://opensourcehacker.com/2013/03/25/using-nullmailer-and-mandrill-for-your-ubuntu-linux-server-outboud-mail/\n\n\n  \n*Install Nullmailer\n  \n  \n  You want to have your email traffic to be SSL encrypted. Nullmailer\n  supports this since version 1.10. Ubuntu 12.04 ships with Nullmailer\n  1.05-1. To get the latest Nullmailer for Ubuntu do from my Ubuntu PPA (see prior blog post about how I backported Nullmailer to Ubuntu\n  12.04)\nNote: This will remove existing mail solutions on the server.\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:mikko-red-innovation/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nullmailer=1:1.11-2~precise1~ppa1\n\n\n\nA: There are many tutorials on the net suggesting the use of --starttls. The nullmailer package for raring (12.04) does not seem to support it. It seems like it was not compiled in.\nTroubleshooting nullmailer is pretty hard, in this case only \"Unspecified temporary error\" was actually logged. A helpful page with troubleshooting tips is Nullmailer Landmine Map, which helped me find the source of this problem.\nTo reach the above conclusion I killed the nullmailer daemon (service nullmailer stop is a nicer way) and started it manually. It outputs unknown option string: '--starttls' (and the same when trying --tls). Nullmailer uses the executable /usr/lib/nullmailer/smtp to send mail and the version in the Ubuntu 12.04 package only accepts these options:\nroot# /usr/lib/nullmailer/smtp -h\nusage: smtp [flags] remote-address < mail-file\nSend an email message via SMTP\n  -p, --port=INT    Set the port number on the remote host to connect to\n      --user=VALUE  Set the user name for authentication\n      --pass=VALUE  Set the password for authentication\n  -d, --daemon      use syslog exclusively\n  -s, --syslog      use syslog additionally\n      --auth-login  Use AUTH LOGIN instead of AUTH PLAIN in SMTP\n\n  -h, --help        Display this help and exit\n\nWhich in contrast to the possible options seem to sparse to me.\nThe conclusion is that the Nullmailer package can not be used with Google's SMTP server due to lack of including the necessary options when compiling the binares. Another conclusion is that Nullmailers documentation is lacking as well as its error reporting.\n\nA: If nullmailer is failing with smtp.gmail.com try using IPv4 address directly: 74.125.206.109\nmy /etc/nullmailer/remotes looks like this:\n74.125.206.108 smtp --port=465 --auth-login --ssl --user=USER@gmail.com --pass=PASS --insecure\n\n", "Q: Bash history for root?

Today in Ubuntu 12.10 when you connect an external NTFS HDD/usb memory stick, the disk remains READABLE to Windows.

(the cursor is in the textbox)\n\n*How can I make it so the numpad of the smartphone/tablet automatically opens when the page opens?\n\n\nA: It is quite simple to do the above. To set automatic focus to the TextField component, you can call forceActiveFocus() from within your TextField component as shown below,\nComponent.onCompleted: {\n    forceActiveFocus()\n}\n\nThis sets the focus to the textfield immediately after it is loaded.\nAs for showing the numpad, you can do so by setting the input hint to numbers only,\ninputMethodHints: Qt.ImhDigitsOnly\n\nYour TextField should look like,\nTextField {\n    id: inputQuestion\n\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        forceActiveFocus()\n    }\n\n    width: units.gu(5)\n    height: units.gu(2)\n\n    errorHighlight: true\n    validator: IntValidator { }\n    text: '?'\n    inputMethodHints: Qt.ImhDigitsOnly\n}\n\nNote: Do not set the width and height in pixels.

Or any other way without deleting the recovery partition ?\nThanks!\n\nA: What you've got is this:\nextended partition holding one logical partition\nprimary partition\nprimary partition\nprimary partition where you want to install Linux\n\nThis is a rather awkward configuration. The problem is that you've maxed out your primary partition table, so you can't create another primary (or extended) partition; and to create additional logical partitions, you'd need to move and/or resize all three of your primary partitions.\nThis can be worked around in various ways. Here's what I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up all your important data. (You should have such a backup already.)\n\n*Using a Windows partitioning tool, Shrink /dev/sdb4 so that there's free space at the end of the partition sufficient to install Linux.\n\n*Download my FixParts program. You can use the Windows version or use a Linux emergency disc that contains it. IIRC, Parted Magic comes with FixParts.\n\n*Using FixParts, use the r option to convert /dev/sdb5 into a primary partition.\n\n*Use the l option to convert /dev/sdb4 into a logical partition.\n\n*Type s to sort the partitions. This will ensure that they're in on-disk order, which will be less confusing than if they're not.\n\n*Type p to view the partition table and verify that they're all present. (Note that FixParts doesn't display extended partitions, though, so don't be concerned when you don't see one.)\n\n*If all is well, type w to save your changes.\n\n*If necessary, reboot into Linux.\n\n*Launch GParted and use it to expand the extended partition, which should now be at the end of the disk, covering what was originally /dev/sdb4 (and will now be /dev/sdb5), to cover the free space at the end of the disk.\n\n*Install Ubuntu. It should create new logical partition(s) at the end of the disk.\n\n\nA: You can't just install on a partition that has data on it ... what I would be inclined to do is use a windows resizing tool for the partition (such as Paragon HDD Manager), which can resize that partition so that it has just enough space for what is on it that you want to save, and then convert the rest into free space ... and then you could attempt a Linux install into that free space (using the partition tools on the install disk - manually partition it).\n... so short answer is No ... not without preliminary work to resize that partition & create a new space for Linux to go ... hopefully you will have no problems turning that space into a 4th primary or 2nd extended partition \nIf there is nothing particularly important on the following FAT32 partition ... perhaps delete it also, and turn all the free space after resizing the preceding drive into a Volume Group, and then you can create multiple logical volumes inside that ... using them for the Linux install, and as share partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*could you clarify which is the recovery partition?\n\n", "Q: LTS Enablement Stacks - Should I use quantal, raring or saucy? I installed Kubuntu 12.04 from a beta ISO and I have been updating it ever since then. However, I want to opt into the hardware enablement stack for Precise now.\nI have two questions:\nFirst, how do I decide between versions? For example, betwen quantal, raring or saucy would I simply pick the latest? (And is saucy available for this purpose yet?)\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-raring xserver-xorg-lts-raring \n\nor \nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-saucy xserver-xorg-lts-saucy\n\nSecond, if I opt into the hardware enablement stack using the raring release, will there be any difficulties or challenges moving to the saucy or subsequent releases later? And what would I have to do at that time?\n\nA: The choice between quantal, raring and saucy is really up to you but these stacks are named after the release they feature in. As such, the saucy stack is currently unreleased and should be considered unsuitable for production.\nMoving between stacks is possible. They're just packages, after all.\nThe only real bad scenario is starting on 12.04, installing 13.04's HWE and then upgrading the distribution to 12.10. Your X stack would be newer than the rest of the system in an untested configuration. I would recommend removing the HWE stack packages before upgrading.\nStandard LTS upgrading (eg to 14.04) is fine though you may need to manually upgrade the HWE. I should also point out that come 14.04, the only two stacks supported for 12.04 are the original stack and 14.04's (which will continue to be supported for the remaining 3 years of 12.04's lifespan).\n", "Q: Wubi took up all of my disk space on Win 7 I tried to create a live 13.04 USB using a 1TB external hard drive and it wouldn't boot on my machine. After that, I booted into windows and tried to run Wubi from the hard drive and I selected the \"help me boot from CD\" option. When it was at the stage of copying the files and it copied way more than it should have and now I only have about 200MB left on windows. Can anyone please tell me if this is reversible? All help appreciated, thanks in advance.\n\nA: When you write an ISO to a USB drive, the ISO \"size\" is the size of the USB partition. When you then install Wubi from that USB, it will copy the entire partition as if it were the ISO.\ne.g. a USB key that is 4 GB, then the C:\\ubuntu\\install\\installation.iso file will be 4 GB. If you happened to have a 32 GB USB, then it will attempt to copy 32 GB.\nNote that this will fail anyway, because Wubi checks the ISO size later. But the fact is it was originally written expecting CDs or DVDs and it doesn't handle USBs in a logical way.\nSo, go find and delete the C:\\ubuntu\\install\\installation.iso file (if you can't boot Windows) or uninstall Ubuntu from the Control panel and it will free up that space.\n", "Q: What does the takeover of Nokia mean for the Ubuntu SDK? Well, the title says it all: \nWhat does the takeover of Nokia by Microsoft mean for the Ubuntu SDK, as the Ubuntu SDK relies on Qt which is (was?) a Nokia project?\n\nA: Microsoft appears not to own the business assets (such as copyrights) associated with Qt, because Nokia sold them (i.e., \"sold Qt\") to Digia before its merger with Microsoft.\nSee also the Wikipedia articles on Qt and Digia, and the references therein.\nTherefore, the takeover should have no impact at all on the Ubuntu SDK.\nFurthermore, even if Microsoft did have any Qt copyrights or other assets--which does not appear to be the case--all released Qt code would still be licensed under the LGPL, and the rights conferred by the LGPL are not revocable by the copyright holder. So we could still use it, though it's possible they might choose a different license for future versions. Again, even this is probably not a concern as Microsoft doesn't own those copyrights.\n", "Q: DNS Server or NameServer Edit connection  Mobile Broadband : select network name :  Edit IP4 settings: Under Methods : Automatic PPP and Automatic PPP address only\nChanged  DNS Server to: 198.153.192.40  and Search Domains To: 198.153.194.40 \nYet the output of $ cat /etc/resolv.conf:  Is\nDynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nsearch 198.153.194.40\n\nIt is the same output on wireless network also. \nIs this normal for nameserver?  \nOut put of Cat /etc/issue :\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS\nRelease:    12.04\nCodename:   precise\nUbuntu 12.04.3 LTS \\n \\l\n\nAm having many intrusions to my PC and wonder if that is a contribute factor. \nAlthough, DNS test like (www.dnsleaktest.com) does show what was implemented at \"Edit Connections\"  That is the IP address' of the public DNS added. \nUbuntu Network Tools (3.2.0) shows:\nDevices:\nNetwork Devices: Loopback interface (lo)\nProtocol:   IPv6  IP address:  ::1  Netmask: 128  Scope: Host\nProtocol: IPv4    IP address:    127.0.0.1    Netmask: 255.0.0.0         Scope:  \n\nA: Yes, that is normal.

Logging in results in the same procedure( black screen -> wait -> login -> ...)\nI somewhere read that the nouveau driver is causing this so I tried to install the nvidia driver (304) on my ubuntu system(13.04) from console because it wasn't listed in the additional drivers tab. The driver causes the monitor to be shut off (black and no backlight) after the kernel started up(logging in and shutting down from terminal works). \nAfter 'apt-get purge nvidia-*'  everything is back to normal( monitor works, suspend doesn't)\nBtw: I have an Nvidia gt330m with a hi-res 1680*1050 display\nIs there anything I can do about it to get suspend to work and even better the nvidia driver?\n\nA: I just ran into the same black screen issue, and it is highly frustrating. Log into your grub menu by holding shift while booting up your mbp, edit the kernel arguments with e, and right before silent splash you should add - nomodeset so it should look like what this guy here has done - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132. If this solves the problem for you, continue with the rest of the instructions for setting it permanently.\n\nok, I've done some looking into this, since I am also currently working on getting my nvidia 740m to work. By the way, your graphics card uses nvidia optimus, so as a side note, you may want to look into bumblebee. But which nvidia drivers are you using? The 319 is the stable release, but not available in the repository However, the 325 beta drivers are available, and It noted some fixes to screen flickering in relation to scaling windows such as ours, so I believe this may be as useful to you as me. I am assuming you are referring to 319 however, but just incase you are not I will provide some links. And for your xconf not working, you could try this:\nsudo /sbin/lsmod | grep nvidia\n\nTo make sure that it is loaded, if not you will have to load it manually like so:\nsudo depmod -a\nsudo modprobe nvidia_current\n\nIf you have issues with that, I would also recommend checking out additional drivers. If you do not have any listed, try this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand check again, there should be some there. Then purge your current proprietary driver and use those and reboot, and enter this:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig --sli=On\n\nSince your card is an optimus, it is best practice to not install nvidia drivers that have optimus though, as there are many issues. So you should install bumblebee to run your graphics intensive programs, and just use the additional drivers or the nvidia-current. If you happen to run into that screen resolution error again, you can use optirun to load your nividia setings directly as well.\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/Bumblebee#Installation \nAlso if you are interested, your graphics card also has support for CUDA, and since this is linux, the drivers don't support this by default just yet, you can install CUDA. There is some better explanations of that here as well. \nHow can I get nVidia CUDA or OpenCL working on a laptop with nVidia discrete card/Intel Integrated Graphics?  And you can get the toolkit from here: \nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads \nHere are the links if you still wish to try those proprietary drivers:\nhttp://linuxg.net/install-new-nvidia-drivers-nvidia-319-17-on-ubuntu-13-04-raring-ringtail/ \nhttp://linuxg.net/how-to-install-nvidia-325-08-beta-drivers-on-ubuntu-linux-mint-debian-fedora-and-opensuse/ \nAnd here is the link referring to the brokn unity window:\nAfter upgrading to 13.04 Unity interface is not showing.\nHopefully this has helped some, if not, let me know and I ill look into it.\n\nA: On the Mac Book Pro 6,2 it is impossible to install a proprietary Nvidia Driver while booting in EFI-mode. Bumblebee can also only be used with the nouveau driver. \nTo solve the problem I followed the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI:\n\"\"\"\nConverting Ubuntu into Legacy mode\nIf Ubuntu is installed on a GPT disk (you can check it via the 'sudo parted -l' command), use Gparted to create a BIOS-Boot partition (1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag) at the start of its disk.\nStart Boot-Repair, click on \"Advanced options\", go to the \"GRUB location\" tab.\nUntick the \"Separate /boot/efi partition\" option\nClick the \"Apply\" button.\nSet up your BIOS so that it boots the HDD in Legacy mode (see the \"\"Set up the BIOS in EFI or Legacy mode\" paragraph above).\n\"\"\"\nAfter that I had to bless the newly installed Bootloader in OSX to make it bootable:\n\"sudo bless --device /dev/disk0s1 --setBoot --legacy\"\nReplace /dev/disk0s1 with the partion you installed grub on earlier. \nAfter a reboot I was now able to install the newest nvidia driver from the additional drivers tab. This fixes the suspend/resume bug and increases battery life. \nThe only drawbacks are that grub resolution can't be set higher than 1200x800x32, the boot sequence is displayed in black and white with 640x480 and so are all the TTY's. \n", "Q: Processor temperature when just browsing the web is 55-60 C I'm running ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop. It has an Intel® Core™ i7-3537U CPU @ 2.00GHz × 4, 8 GB ram, and an AMD Radeon HD 8730M It also has a Intel HD 4000 but i'm using AMD\nI have nothing else open than Chromium, A terminal, and konversation and CPU temp is 55-60 C or even more sometimes. When I run a 3D game it goes up to 80-85 and again sometimes even more. In Windows 8 tho... temp is at 54 C most of the time. Is this normal? If not, is there something I can do about it or  this is strictly hardware related problem? (if it's a problem). Help?\n\nA: Well, I've got a laptop with a similar config (an nvidia discrete gpu instead of amd), and used to face the same cooling issues as you until I started using TLP- which is a command line power management tool for linux. Here are the steps to isntall it : http://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/improve-power-usage-battery-life-in.html\nI also use bumblebee which helped reduce my idle temps. by around 5-7 degrees, though its only for nvidia optimus laptops. I'm pretty sure there's a similar tool for amd switchable graphics. \n\nA: This temperature is absolutely normal. You should start to worry if the temperature reaches  70-80 when 'just browsing the web'. \nAlso keep in mind that flash applications can eat your CPU. See Hardware acceleration of Chrome's Flash plugin for info on reducing CPU usage (thus temperature height) when using flash applications.\n", "Q: GParted cannot identify swap partition on Ubuntu 13.04 I had a major system crash, after which I reinstalled Ubuntu 13.04. The problem was that I wasn't sure about creating a partition for swap using GParted because from what the online tutorials seemed to indicate, creation of a new partition would leave the original drive marked as \"unallocated\" with the remainder of free space (I might be wrong though, but I was hesitant). \nAnyway, I couldn't boot either Windows or Ubuntu after I created a separate 4GB partition from my C drive on Windows. I ran a boot repair and fixed my Windows. Now the problem is that my system can detect swap at start up unlike here : Safe to create a swap partition using GParted? , but GParted shows it to be an \"unknown\" partition. \n\nIs there a way this can be fixed? Would it be okay to just right click and set it as swap, or are there some other changes to be made?\n\nA: It's safe to set it as swap. You should even be able to select it in Gparted, tell it to be swap and enable swap (Swapon) and go, no reboot etc needed.\n", "Q: Can I make profitable app for Ubuntu Touch? I would like to ask you guys, if there would be some sort of app policy regarding the Ubuntu touch. Just as in Android, and iOS, the developers could earn a reasonable amount of money, by making their applications paid for, or by placing adds in the app. Will this kind of things available in the Ubuntu Touch, or the app ecosystem will be only allowing free open source applications?\n(I am not talking about the big paid for projects made by the big guns, just the one men projects)\n\nA: Currently Ubuntu Touch is in development and many of these details are not yet worked out.\n\nWill the app ecosystem only allow free open source applications? \n\n\n*\n\n*You can publish your app under any number of licenses including Proprietary \n\n\nCan you make your app a paid app? \n\n\n*\n\n*At http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/ #4 states:\n\nChoose your price\nNot all software is free in the Software Centre.

However payments are not yet in place.\n\nCan you place ads in the app?\nThis question is probably the hardest to answer at the moment, because at the moment it seems there is no \"ad system\". This would be important for many reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It would be similar to spyware if a individual application would access and deliver information for placing ads, as well as resource consuming if many apps were doing it at once.\n\n*Need of approved ads, ones that would not hack/crash/do any buffer-overflow/automatically install programs/ect. or  mislead to \"Download Here\" when a real download link is elsewhere.\n\n*Acceptable ad area, so we don't encourage targeting accidental clicks or guerrilla tactics that only frustrate users (are they really going to buy/download a product they were practically forced to click on). Possible area for banner format ads when you look at the design of many of the current apps: \n \nNote: Just a mock-up and not actual ad placement or views of developers, nor am I saying there should be ads in the clock app.\nThere are many discussions about how it should be, but I think many free apps that are currently are for Android show how it shouldn't be: Requiring every kind of permission (and they say that is only to serve ads), pop up videos, slide in graphics, Begging for ratings, you name it - Will Ubuntu Touch be the same \"anything goes\" in this aspect?\nOr will there be no ads allowed altogether - In favor of trial (of which can be added to the software center) and paid versions, or altogether free.\nPossibly a framework for ads could made as hbdgaf suggested in chat :\n\nSo it was said it isn't ad driven. It should be. Not putting ads in\n  lenses, but a way to get something google-esque with an ad framework\n  integrated in to the app framework. Say I want to make a cool app for\n  u-touch and not get paid for it. Ad funding should be an option. Maybe\n  it still is, but ad is a hot-word so they left it alone and said it's\n  not a thing. Just saying... A framework should be in place. It isn't.\n  This is a way to get there from here.\n\nFor now it seems in the developer preview they are focusing on the \"Core\" apps and experience, and we have not yet seen how the paid/ad system will look.\n", "Q: How to recover files from a partition that was previosuly NTFS under Wndows but after Ubuntu installation had been converted to ext4?

Just like typing \"firefox\" and firefox starts...\n\nA: *\n\n*Put it in the path or alter the path. You can run echo $PATH to see your path. If this is just for one user, ~/bin/ is a suitable location. Otherwise, move the file to /usr/local/bin/. You'll need to do that as root.\n\n*In order for it to be directly executable (without asking Python to run it explicitly):\n\n\n*\n\n*It needs to be executable: chmod +x filename\n\n*It needs a shebang at the beginning of a file: #!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n*You should probably rename it so it doesn't have .py on the end\n\n\n\nThe alternative for this is you just create a launcher shell script that runs python /path/to/script.py. This would save you having to move your file somewhere special but the same rules apply. It needs would need to be set executable, be in your path and start with a #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash shebang.\n\nA: You need to either place the script within your $PATH or add the path where the script is located to your $PATH (I'd recommend the first). To avoid having to manually choose the interpreter to invoke, you should include a shebang line at the top of your script like #!/usr/bin/env python3 and make the script executable with chmod a+x name_of_script.

From what I understand is if a file has a mask of 0755 the mode of the file would be 7022 correct? It is basically inverted numbers? \n\nA: Files have modes, on creation time the mask will determine the mode, based on the requested mode. A mask works like a stencil and can best be illustrated using the binary representation.\nAn umask of 0002 (common octal integer format) is represented as\n000 000 000 010\n\nin binary form, or\n--- --- --- -w-\n\nin symbolic form.\nLet's say a file is to be created by the user, the mode is 0777 by default (for executables), but the mask will be \"substracted\" in a manner of speaking. This results in the w bit to be removed.\n--- rwx rwx rwx  (mode)\n--- --- --- -w-  (mask)\n_______________ -\n--- rwx rwx r-x  ==  000 111 111 101  ==  0775\n\nFor regular files (non-executables), the requested mode is without the x (executable) bit, i.e. 0666, so the mask will then result in:\n--- rw- rw- rw-  (mode)\n--- --- --- -w-  (mask)\n_______________ -\n--- rw- rw- r--  ==  000 110 110 100  ==  0664\n\nThe latter one is common in directory listings (in which the first octet with SUID/SGID bits isn't shown), e.g.:\n-rw-rw-r--   2 gert gert      228 Mar 20  2012 .vimrc\n\nOf course, you can always change these modes with for example the chmod command, for which the umask will not be considered in editing.\n", "Q: How to rotate desktop background?

I'd like to install Ubuntu server on my machine, is there a step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish that or a guide that will just go through the basic steps of installing Ubuntu Server from beginning to end.\nInstructions originally for 13.04.\n\nA: First, you will need to download the current version of Ubuntu Server. A 64 bit version is recommended, but you can also download a 32bit version from http://releases.ubuntu.com/.  Once downloaded you need to create a bootable CD/DVD or USB flash.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to burn a DVD on Windows\n\n*How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows \n\n*How to burn a DVD on Ubuntu\n\n*How to create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu \nOnce done, put the disc in your drive, or insert the USB flash, and reboot your machine. Make sure that you set your BIOS to boot either from the CD/DVD or USB flash depending on which installation method you choose.\nOnce booted, just follow the steps shown in the images below.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*On the first screen you can choose you language of install.\n\n\n*Select Install Ubuntu Server.\n\n\n*Select the language used for the installation process.\n\n\n*Select your geographical location.\n\n\n*Configure your keyboard.  I choose no to manually choose the keyboard.\n\n\n*I choose the English (US) for country origin.\n\n\n*I choose the English (US) keyboard layout.\n\n\n*At this point the system will detect the hardware to find a CD-ROM drive.\n\n\n*At this step, the installation will detect and load any additional component.\n\n\n*At this step, the installation will detect the network hardware.\n\n\n*Type in the host name you want to configure your server as.\n\n\n*Type in the user's name.\n\n\n*Type in a password for the username.\n\n\n*Choose whether to encrypt your home directory or not.  I recommend selecting No I recommend selecting No because it makes it easier to do recovery if needed in case a corruption of data happens.\n\n\n*Configure clock, and time zone.\n\n\n*At this point, the installation is detecting disks, and other hardware.\n\n\n*At this stage is were you partition your disk(s).  Select Guided as it is the default method. \n\n\n*Select the partition of your choice, is this installation its the SCSI1.\n\n\n*Select Yes to start writing the changes to disks, and configure LVM.\n\n\n*Answer Yes to actually write the changes to disk.\n\n\n*The installation is copying data at this stage.\n\n\n*At this stage the installation is configuring Apt Sources.List.\n\n\n*This is were you can configure a Proxy.  I select Continue since I'm not using a proxy.\n\n\n*The installation is selecting the software being installed.\n\n\n*This is where you configure how to install updates.  I choose the automatic method.\n\n\n*You can choose one these option at the time of install or later.  if you select continue, you can manually choose what you want to install later.\n\n\n*Cleaning up is being done.\n\n\n*Starting the installation of Grub\n\n\n*Select Yes to install grub to the Master Boot Record.\n\n\n*Finishing the installation.  Select continue and remove the disk or USB.\n\nYou're done.  Reboot your machine, and type in your username you created earlier, and your password to login.  That is it, you are now logged in to your new Ubuntu server!\n\nA: Some more details about the other options in the first Step.\nFirst, this menu also offers you an option to Check disc for defects. Although I'm sure you've done well in creating your media, all it takes is for a small\ncorruption in the download or with the dd command and you would end up\nwith invalid media. This is extremely rare—but it does happen from time to\ntime. If you have the extra time, it may make sense to verify your media.\nThis menu gives you the option to Test memory. This is an option\nI've found myself using far more often than I'd like to admit. Defective\nRAM on computers and servers is surprisingly common and can cause all\nkinds of strange things to happen. For one, defective RAM may cause your\ninstallation to fail. Worse, your installation could also succeed—and I say\nthat's worse due to the fact you'd find out about problems later rather than\nright away. While doing a memory test can add considerable time to the\ninstallation process, I definitely recommend it, especially if the hardware is\nnew and hasn't ever been tested at all. In fact, I make it a process to test the\nRAM of all my servers once or twice a year, so this media can be used as a\nmemory tester any time you need one. \nThe Rescue a broken systemThe Rescue a broken system option is\nalso useful to recover systems that, for some reason, are unable to boot at all.\nSource - Mastering Ubuntu Server(book)\n", "Q: Networking problem with Ubuntu as guest in VMware workstation on Windows 7 64bit I've the following configuration:\nA.

Why does Ubuntu wait weeks and sometimes months to release new Nvidia driver updates?  It doesn't seem to make any sense at all.  Is this common practice to serve up old drivers and not official Nvidia recommended drivers?\nBackground: coming from Windows 7 and XP I'm used to my Nvidia drivers being in sync with the official Nvidia release cycle and always having extremely fresh drivers available. However with Ubuntu it seems that new upstream Nvidia releases are delayed for way too long before being released to the main repositories. Nvidia Ubuntu drivers should always be at the most recent version officially endorsed by Nvidia themselves as STABLE. This affects the quality of the experience I have with Nvidia on Ubuntu because newer drivers mean greater performance/stability, new features and added support for new Nvidia cards. Ubuntu needs to embrace a rapid-release cycle where new drivers are quickly put into production and release it to the main repository where all Ubuntu can update to it especially for LTS users.\nJust filed Launchpad Bug #1219908 about my frustration with the slow-release cycle of the Nvidia drivers in the main Ubuntu repositories and it got upgraded to Wishlist. If this problem affects you too you can log into www.launchpad.net and click the “this affects me too” button the bug report and let the package maintainers know that you would like a faster release cycle so you can have access to fresh drivers in sync with official Nvidia releases.\nNvidia Official Linux Drivers List\n\nA: \"Why does Ubuntu wait weeks and sometimes months to release new Nvidia driver updates?\"\n\n*\n\n*Other things get in the way - Usually, a specific person or group of people will be in charge of packaging the driver and putting it up, unless the process is automated. Usually, these people also have several other projects and responsibilities and as a result need to prioritize. Believe it or not, the open source world is rather... understaffed, as it were. So there is not really much that can be done about that situation. (Though you, I, and all the thousands of others surely appreciate the hard work of the team of people who work on this.)\n\n\n*The drivers need to be tested - Like all other software, the nVidia drivers not only need to be packaged, but also tested before being put forward to the repositories.\nNow, to provide a solution for you:\nYou can use the nVidia proprietary \"blob\" from their download server, rather than the version from Ubuntu's repositories. It comes with a feature that automatically detects and installs the latest and greatest driver version:\n./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-319.49.run -a --update -X --no-runlevel-check -q\n\nOr, if you just want to check for the latest version:\n./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-319.49.run -l\n\nPerhaps a script could be created from this, for example \"every day, check to see if there is a new version available, and if there is, tell the user to run the utility\"...\nOr, you could just check the server every week or so, if this is really that important to you.\n", "Q: Unlock login screen using command line Is it possible to unlock the 13.04 Gnome shell login screen\nfrom a command line? A user is logged in to Gnome shell, I can log in to a console as this user. I also have root access.\nThis is for accessing an active X11 display through VNC, without having to enter the password.\nExecuting\ngnome-screensaver-command -d\n\nas suggested in a blog post didn't help.\n\n\nA: The following worked for me:\nsudo killall gnome-screensaver\n\nEspecially helpful when you're logged in via SSH with another user.\n\nA: I'm assuming you have a recent linux system with systemd (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 or newer).\nIf you need to unlock your own session, just run loginctl unlock-session (no root required because it's your own session). If you have multiple sessions and want to select just one, run loginctl list-sessions to identify session and then run e.g. loginctl unlock-session c187.\nIf you need to unlock all sessions, just run sudo loginctl unlock-sessions. Note that this will immediately unlock ALL sessions no matter which user is running the screen saver.\n\nIf you need more information to identify the correct session, you can try something like this:\nloginctl list-sessions --no-legend | while read id rest; do echo; loginctl show-session $id; done\n\n\nA: I had a problem with gnome 3's screen lock (screensaver) being stuck at a blank screen. I managed to work around it by replacing the gnome-shell window manager.\nCtrl+Alt+F1 and log in on a virtual console, then:\npkill -QUIT gnome-shell\nDISPLAY=:0.0 gnome-shell -r &\n\n(& Backgrounds the new gnome-shell so you can log out of the virtual console and keep it running. Alternatively use Ctrl+Z to suspend the gnome-shell process, and bg to background it.)\nIt might not be elegant, but it finally allowed me to get back to my desktop apps without having gnome force me to logout.\n\nA: The problem with executing commands like gnome-screensaver-command from an SSH session is usually that they don't automatically connect to the appropriate session bus for the active desktop session - usually, setting the DISPLAY variable will fix that, for example these work for me (logged in via SSH as the same user who owns the locked X session, which is on DISPLAY :0):\n$ DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screensaver-command -d\n\nto unlock, and\n$ DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screensaver-command -l\n\nto lock.\nAlternatively, you can toggle the active state using dbus-send - for example\n$ export DISPLAY=:0\n$ dbus-send --session \\\n          --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver \\\n          --type=method_call \\\n          --print-reply \\\n          --reply-timeout=20000 \\\n          /org/gnome/ScreenSaver \\\n          org.gnome.ScreenSaver.SetActive \\\n          boolean:false\n\nSource: https://people.gnome.org/~mccann/gnome-screensaver/docs/gnome-screensaver.html#gs-examples\n\nA: I had a similar problem where the unlock screen wouldn't accept keyboard input sometimes.  The way I finally solved it was to kill the several gnome-screensaver processes that were running, as well as one gnome-screensaver-dialog process.  I'm guessing that whatever process was spawning 2 gnome-screensaver sessions was messing up my unlock screen.  I'm actually supposed to be using xscreensaver instead, so maybe that messed with it.\nAnyways, Ctrl+Alt+F1, look for screensaver processes running ps -aux | grep screen and kill them all.  The gnome and xscreensaver commands listed in the other answers didn't work for me.\n", "Q: What is wrong with my rc.local file? I try to run some commands at boot. I learned that one should add them in the /etc/rc.local file (on ubuntu 12.04 LTS).\nHere my file:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\n/usr/bin/touch /tmp/test.rc.local\n\nexit 0\n\nBut after reboot no file was created in /tmp/ which indicates to me that rc.local was never executed.\nNote: rc.local as (in my opinion) the right permission:\n> ls -l rc.local \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 446 Sep  3 15:55 rc.local\n\n\nA: As for you original idea\n/usr/bin/xautolock -locker 'gnome-screensaver-command -a' -time 10\n\nThis seems strange for me. Both xautolock and gnome-screensaver-command are X-applications and init runs them in a console. Eg. they will fail because you don't have DISPLAY. You should add it as a startup application instead either global or just in your user. Search Startupapplications in the dash to see and add for your user only.\nI would have added full  path to the gnome-screensaver-command and remember to disable the original screeensaver.\n", "Q: Black Screen on Login 12.04.3 I've recently installed a fresh version of Ubuntu 12.04.3 Desktop.

(this was freshly burnt @ 4x from the ubuntu website).\nI thought I found the issue and that was because I did not delete the 4GB windows boot partition, so I deleted it, I'm thinking I might have made a mistake I read i cant update my bios without it but I don't know the validity of that statement and can not find a reference.\nI then proceeded with an an exact install as noted above (remember i deleted my windows boot partition this time). And I received and error that said:\nNo File Found\n\nGRUB recovery:\n\nOr something very close, booted into the UEFI/BIOS and made sure I have CSM enabled, Secure Boot disabled and PXE disabled also(just checking..!)

I found this problem and it was related to the /boot partition not being at the beginning of the drive, i shall try that and report back.\n\nA: The bios_grub partition is for booting BIOS based machines, not UEFI.  For that you need to create an EFI system partition instead.  Also you don't need a separate /boot partition.\nThe grub install path should be /dev/sda, with no partition number ( or sdb if that's where you put the EFI system partition ).  Set the EFI system partition to be mounted in /boot/grub/efi.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use `musique` to sync with an iPod? I was reading online about a program called musique, so I installed it. It's quite a lot better than rhythmbox in my opinion. The only thing is I can't find a way to sync it with my iPod, make playlists, smart or normal, which is annoying because smart playlists and the ability to rate songs are key features I need to be able to manage my iPod.\nIf you haven't got a solution could you direct me to a different opensource program to manage my iPod that can rate songs, and create smart playlists (and sync with my iPod of course) that IS NOT Clementine, Banshee, amarok, songbird, or rhythmbox\n\nA: In my experience synchronizing iPods in Linux specially the touch ones can result into some troubles, you'll have serious trouble if you'll sync again with iTunes (wich is something every iPod user does from time to time). My suggestion is to keep synching it with iTunes (using wine or in another OS) and buy a different portable music player, an android based one could be a better choice in the future if you'd prefer using Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Failed loading skin error message with Spotify I just started having this problem.

When I go to startup disk creator and click other the ubuntu iso file has no bytes so I cannot create a file to install ubuntu why?\n\nA: If you just want to create a Live USB for Ubuntu, use unetbootin instead. Easy to use, either download from internet and create, or create from a local ISO file.\nOtherwise, you can use dd to do the same thing. For example sudo dd if=/path/to/Ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M.\n\nA: First plug-in the usb device and run the following command\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis will give you list of all the partitions you have. Check the partitions carefully.

I normally just use sharing, but I believe you would do it this way if using fstab:\n/dev/sdb1 /media/NEWHD ext4\n/media/NEWHD/shareddocs /home/foc\n\nOr, if you don't want to edit fstab, you can use mount without --bind\nsudo mount /newhd/shareddocs /home/foc\nEDIT2\nPersonally, I have no experience with the bind option - I normally just use symbolic links, which work fine for what I have needed.  Not there are good reasons for using bind, and it is a good way to mirror a directory structure without creating a special file that may not work in all situations.\nSo, there are a couple of tricks that might help, although I think the solution is simply to add \"bind\" as an option in /etc/fstab.\nThere is another file similar to fstab in the same directory, named /etc/mtab; this file shows all the current mounts, whether done via the mount command or via the fstab file.  So, you can look at this file (cat /etc/mtab, or use gedit), and copy the line that is working into /etc/fstab.  I believe you will find that the line is /media/NEWHD/SharedDOCS /home/foc none rw,bind 0 0.\nThe other trick is useful whenever you are making changes to /etc/fstab. After you make a change, save the changed file but don't close it yet.  Then, go to the terminal and enter sudo mount -a - This will mount everything in fstab, and if there are any errors, it will tell you about them now, rather than possibly finding out at boot time.  Depending on circumstances, you may need to unmount first if there was an error, then remount using this command.\n\nA: I think you have to run this command:\nmount --bind /media/NEWHD /home/foc\n\nMaybe this will fix the problem.\n", "Q: Why does Grub report two items for Windows 7? I did a clean install of Windows 7 on the same hard drive. I followed the instructions at:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/\nI followed the terminal instructions to restore grub bootloader.\nWhenever I reboot. I see two entries of Windows 7 on Grub. I don't recall seeing this the last time. I am aware that Windows creates a 'System Reserved' partition (which is currently on sda1).\nWhen I select either of the two boot options, Windows 7 boots fine (so it seems).\nThis is what update-grub returns:\n$ sudo update-grub | tee ~/update-grub.txt\n[sudo] password for christian:\nGenerating grub.cfg ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-29-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-29-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-27-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-27-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-19-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-19-generic\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda2\ndone\n\nWill booting from the System Reserved cause any issues on Windows?\nWhy are there two entries of Windows 7 instead of 1? Should I have installed Windows 7 without creating a system reserved partition? Is that even an option?\nI am on Ubuntu 13.04. My other Ubuntu machines only list down 1 entry for Windows 7. Ideally, if it had to list down 2 entries. It would be better if it displayed as:\nFound Windows 7 (System Reserved) on /dev/sda1\nFound Windows 7 on /dev/sda2\n\nCan this changes be made via a Grub configuration file somewhere?\n\nA: This 2nd entry has been added by Boot-Repair as a security: from now, if you accidentally delete the sda1 partition, you will still be able to boot Windows via the 2nd entry.\nIf you want to hide or rename one one these entries, you can use GRUB-Customizer, that you can install via its PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n\nA: That's normal, though not often behavior. For Windows, GRUB detects loaders, not systems. In your case, there are loaders on system reserved partition and on Windows partition. You may want to delete one of those loaders, but I do not recommend to do this, because it can harm your system. Keeping both loaders is the safest decision.\nYou can even create more loaders, and all of them will be recognized! It is convenient to use them if you want to load different versions of Windows straight from GRUB. Just experiment with this command:\nbcdboot C:\\Windows /s D:\n\nAs it is typed, it will create loader on D: drive, which will load Windows from default location. Replacing C: and D: you can adjust which version to load and from where.\nIf you want to delete some loaders not using GRUB-Customizer (which sometimes gets out of development), look for Boot folder on Windows 7+ systems and ntloader file on XP and earlier systems.\nModern way is to delete corresponding files from EFI partitions or to disable them with efibootmgr.\n\nA: yes you can do it by type \"sudo gedit\" if your style gedit or \"sudo nano\" if your style is nano\nso it will be sudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg just find menu entry for your windows on /sda1 and rename that as you want\n\nex: \n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\nmenuentry 'Windows 10 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)'\n\nto \n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\nmenuentry 'Windows 10 (System Reserved) (on /dev/sda1)'\n\n", "Q: Is Java installed by default? I'm asking this because Libre Office was pre-installed and some of it's features require Java. I don't want Java because of a malicious remote administration tool (RAT) called jRAT and there are also others. But with this even a script kiddie can take control of my computer.\n\nA: Simple answer, Java is not installed by default in any Ubuntu system (in fact this goes against the Java distribution policy, that's why is being included in the non-free repository).\nYou can check the packages manifest of any version of Ubuntu, and you will notice that it does not include either JDK nor Java.\nPrecise Pangolin package manifest:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/precise/ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-i386.manifest\nRaring Ringtail package manifest:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/raring/ubuntu-13.04-desktop-i386.manifest\nYou can search the list up and down, and you will find no reference to Java (please don't confuse with JavaScript, that is different).\n(Links are thanks to our friend Oli)\n\n\n*\n\n*How does LibreOffice run, then?\nlibreoffice suggest the package java-runtime for some specifics functions but isn't necessary the complete Java Virtual Machine. It also includes their very own packages with Java classes, scripts, and config snippets called libreoffice-java-common, but not all the suite require the packages (only writer and base). Hence, you can use most of LO without even installing Oracle's Java or openJDK.\n\n*Do you just mean Oracle Java is not installed? Is OpenJDK also not present?\nThis was answered above:\n\nYou can check the packages manifest of any version of Ubuntu, and you will notice that it does not include either JDK nor Java.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the differences between Oracle Java and OpenJDK from a security perspective are pretty small?\nAccording to Thomas Pornin from Security.SE, yes, the differences are none. Both share lots of code, which made them both vulnerable. There was even a case where Ubuntu was affected by one vulnerability which right now is fixed. (non citatory)\nYou can read his full answer (along others) here.\nHope this address all inquiries.\n", "Q: Is it bad if the Update Manager doesn't show any new updates for a whole week? I've used the 12.04 live cd to get here but installed it awhile ago. I assume until a week ago I was current but now I'm not so sure.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid?  \n\nA: Let me explain the way how package updating & upgrading works. Also, I'd like to cover distinguishes between them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Updating is the procedure of fetching and comparing package lists. It can be initiated by this command:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe APT application will get package lists, which contain information about packages available on download servers, their version and dependency information, and will determine which packages should be upgraded.\n\n*Upgrading is the procedure of actual changing installed packages. It can update, remove or install new packages. By default, for safety reasons, upgrade does only update:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nbut you can force it to make (un)installations:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nJust glance of these commands' output: the first will say that some packages will not be processed, and the second will make all the changes that should be made. For example, it will install new kernel image if it is available.\nSo, returning to your question, the 'updated x hours ago' message means that your package lists are updated, and there are not updates for installed packages. This is typical for LTS releases which are not frequently updated releases. They [almost] rarely receive security and stability updates.  And for accomplishing the same thing that the GUI update manager does you should run in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu JeOS work with Xen? Can I install Ubuntu as Minimal Virtual Install (formarly called Ubuntu JeOS1) on Xen hypervisor or not?\nDoes it only support KVM and VMware?\n1. Ubuntu JeOS a version of Ubuntu that can be installed with the Server CD selecting \"Minimal virtual machine\" at the install screen.\n\nA: The Ubuntu minimal virtual install differs from the standard server install in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*lesser packages are installed;\n\n*a different kernel is installed.\n\n\nBefore Oneiric, the kernel was the one provided by the linux-image-*-virtual packages. Nowadays, the kernel used by the minimal install is linux-image-*-generic. Instead, standard server and desktop installs use both linux-image-*-generic and linux-image-extra-*-generic.\nAll of this to say that if the minimal install does not work, it's because it lacks some drivers and modules that are shipped with the extra package.\nSo, the question is: are the drivers sufficient to run Ubuntu on Xen? I don't know and I can't try at the moment. If vmbuilder does not let you use Ubuntu Minimal with Xen, it's a different matter.\nWhat I can say is that Launchpad PPA builders and Amazon EC2 run on Xen, and I am pretty sure that neither of them are using the extra kernel package.\n", "Q: Why do I need a strong password for my Ubuntu user account? Assuming that no one else has physical access to my computer, assuming that I don't run any unusual services, do I still need a strong password for my Ubuntu user account (it has admin privileges)? \nI've heard that any Ubuntu system connected to the Internet needs a strong password because it may somehow affect not only this particular system, but even other machines with Internet access as well (for example, it would be easier to install spambots on a machine with a weak password). Is this true? How exactly does this happen? Do I also need strong passwords on my VirtualBox test systems?\nThank you\n\nA: The reasons to have a strong password are multiple. You can use Google in this sense. I will only note that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choosing a good password will help to keep your computer safe. If your password is easy to guess, someone may figure it out and gain access to your personal information.\n\n*People could even use computers to systematically try to guess your password, so even one that would be difficult for a human to guess might be extremely easy for a computer program to crack. \n\n\nEven so, Ubuntu does not force you to use a strong password. By default, Ubuntu requires a minimum password length of 6 characters, but, assuming that no one else has physical access to your computer and assuming that you don't run any unusual services, you can turn off all the password prompts or you can enable auto-login or you can set a short password on Ubuntu.\nRegarding the second question, I can say that I find it aberrant. So no, you didn't heard well.\n", "Q: file command reports text/plain for .css file I'm trying to get xdg-open to open css files with correct editor, but can't get file to report correct mimetype for a file.css file. There is an entry both in /etc/mime.types and a file already exist as /usr/share/mime/text/css.xml but this always happens:\n➜  ~  echo \". {}\" > file.css\n➜  ~  file --mime-type file.css\nfile.css: text/plain\n➜  ~  \n\nWhen I trace the code, I see that it uses magic instead of /usr/share/mime/text mime db. How can I get file to report this as text/css instead of text/plain?\n\nA: AFAIK you can't use file -i or file --mime-type to test the functionality of the system-wide MIME database. file uses magic and its config by default, so to change the behavior of file, you would have to change the magic config.\nTo check and modify the xdg-open behavior instead, you should use the XDG-Utilities. For example, you can check the current settings how to handle files with text/plain MIME type:\n~ $ xdg-mime query default text/plain\n\nOn my Mint laptop, it returns\ngedit.desktop\n\nFor text/css, there's usually no default application set (you can check this using xdg-mime query default text/css). To change this and set GEdit as default CSS editor, you could use the following command:\n~ $ xdg-mime default gedit.desktop text/css\n\nThis will insert a line in /home/<Username>/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list with text/css=gedit.desktop. Instead of using xdg-mime, you could modify the mimeapps.list directly.\nNow, xdg-mime query returns the application i've chosen ...\n~ $ xdg-mime query default text/css\ngedit.desktop\n\n... and xdg-open /tmp/file.css will start GEdit and load the CSS fiile.\nSee also this page on xdg-open from the Arch Linux Wiki.\n", "Q: How to fix \"Power calibration error\" when trying to burn DVD? Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is not being able to burn any file to a DVD.\nEvery time I try to burn anything, it shows an error window and gives this error while burning:\nscsi error on write(786,16):[3 73 03] Power calibration error\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: your drive dislikes the medium. You will have to use\na different media product or a different drive.\nRegrettably the brand name on the box tells few\nabout the real manufacturerer and the product inside.\nYou will have to guess.\nA bold and significant change should be a switch\nfrom DVD-R[W] to DVD+R[W], resp. vice versa.\n\nThe error message text stems from libburn.\nThe code [3 73 03] was reported to it by the DVD drive.\nThe problem is not specific to the operating system.\nUbuntu's Linux kernel was only the messenger between\nlibburn and drive.\n\"Power calibration error\" is the human readable text that\nis registered in the MMC specification for that code.\nMMC-5 has about power calibration:\n\"3.1.53 Optimum Power Calibration [...]\nOPC is a procedure performed by an optical storage device\nto calibrate laser power. Values from this calibration\nare used for subsequent write operations.\"\nI.e. the burner did a few test writes on the medium\nand was not satisfied with the results.\nHave a nice day :)\nThomas\n\nA: Before burning, most burner software will do a tiny test-burn to try and  establish an maximum optimum speed. If you are using inexpensive media and perhaps have an old drive this might happen more often than you like. The easiest \"fix\" is to burn at a preset slower speed, like 4x. This will stop the software from trying a test burn at a much higher (and more prone to failure) speed.\n", "Q: What happens if I manually change the USER environment variable After running env in the terminal to check if some of my other variables were persistant across settings I noticed the USER=xxx environment variable.\nI've had to reinstall Ubuntu before after fooling around with some system files so this time I'm nervous to simply experiment with things myself.\nWhat would happen if I ran sudo export USER=NewUser?\n\nA: Nothing dangerous! It will only change the value for $USER variable until you close current shell session. But, until to close the current shell session, the new value will be used and because of this it is possible that some applications or scripts where this variable is used to not run as expected.\n\nA: Long story short: nothing\nThe environment variables are only valid during the actual session (e.g. as long as you don't close the Terminal). But because you open a new session for root with sudo which exit emidiately after changing the environment this command will not even touch your session.\nIf you want to permanentaly change environment variables you can use either /etc/profiles or ~\\.bashrc\n", "Q: Corrupted super block Ok, so this is driving me nuts.

Most of the time I use Ubuntu, I use Windows to play games only.\n\n\nActually my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which size should I mention while creating torrents?\n\n*Is there any tool or software or formula to calculate the file size in Ubuntu equivalent to file size in Windows?\n\n\nI have already tried following links but could not find my actual answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Windows File System files show different size after being copied\n\n*Why would ISO file sizes be different in different OS?\n\nA: Windows assumes that there are 1024 Bytes in a Kilobyte unit, and 1024 Kilobytes in a Megabyte unit.  While Ubuntu assumes, a 1000 bytes constitute a Kilobyte (KB) unit, 1000 Kilobytes for a Megabyte (MB) and so on.\nWindows is using the ‘binary prefix’, and  Ubuntu or GNU/Linux, is using it in its ‘proper’ foam.\n\nThe IEC and NIST standardized, and changed the symbols into …\nIn usage, products and concepts typically described using powers of\n  1024 would continue to be, but with the new IEC prefixes.\nFor example, a memory module of 536870912 bytes (512×1048576) would be\n  referred to as 512 MiB or 512 mebibytes instead of 512 MB or 512\n  megabytes. Conversely, since hard drives have historically been\n  marketed using the SI convention that “giga” means 1000000000, a “500\n  GB” hard drive would still be labeled as such.\nAccording to these recommendations, operating systems and other\n  software would also use binary and SI prefixes in the same way, so the\n  purchaser of a “500 GB” hard drive would find the operating system\n  reporting either “500 GB” or “466 GiB“, while 536870912 bytes of RAM\n  would be displayed as “512 MiB”.wikipedia\n\nSo to answer your first question, use the size that's based on the fact that a MB is 1024KB.  As far as the second question, I'm not aware of such a tool.\n", "Q: unoconv is not working in python I've an issue while using unoconv to convert docs to html from a Python script.\nIt works perfectly when I run the script or the unoconv commands as root, but it fails when I do the same from other user.

Is this only for signature?\n\n*What's the difference between bzr builddeb and sbuild?\n\n*I found the build scripts which jenkins used is located here: ~openstack-ubuntu-testing/openstack-ubuntu-testing, but when I try to run any commands under bin, I always get:\nroot@demo:~/openstack-ubuntu-testing/bin# ./build-package\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./build-package\", line 14, in <module>\n    from openstack_ubuntu_testing.build.component_build import ComponentBuild\n  File \"/home/sysadmin/openstack-ubuntu-testing/bin/openstack_ubuntu_testing/build/component_build.py\", line 11, in <module>\n    from schroot.executor import SchrootExecutor\nImportError: No module named schroot.executor\n\nI tried to use pip to install schroot, but it seems they don't have a executor in it.\nPlease help.\n\nA: sbuild builds a package in an isolated environment using schroot. In this environment, only the build dependencies declared by the source package are installed, and nothing else. This helps ensure that the build isn't influenced by the developer or CI environment it is run from. For example, without sbuild, the presence of a package in the CI environment might make it appear that the build succeeds when in fact it was an undeclared build dependency and so fails everywhere else. For reproducibility and stability reasons, it is better to use sbuild.\n", "Q: Jack does not have a \"connect\" option, how do I fix this? I have been trying to configure jack on my laptop. I think I found part of the problem, and then ran into a new one. On jack, there is no \"Connect\" option. \"Start\" is missing as well. There are three menu options on the main screen; quit, setup, and about. Hopefully after I fix this issue I will be all set. Thank you all in advance. \n\nA: I figured out the problem for this.

dependencies.\nYou can give a try to following methods to fix the packages with unmet dependencies:\n\n\n*\n\n*First uninstall the packages completely which have unmet dependencies such as wine and vlc and gstreamer itself. Open terminal(CTRL+ALT+T) and execute following commands in series:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get --purge remove vlc && sudo apt-get autoremove vlc\nsudo apt-get --purge remove *gstreamer* && sudo apt-get autoremove *gstreamer*\nsudo apt-get --purge remove wine && sudo apt-get autoremove wine\n\nIt should remove all the packages with unmet dependencies.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once all the packages will be removed execute following commands to update/upgrade and install your packages:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get -f install vlc\n\nyou can replace vlc by wine also if vlc installed successfully or what every gstreamer packages you want to install.\nHope it will work for you without any problem.\n\nHere is the best solution for you\nI always use Synaptic Package Manager to fix such issues. Using it you can forcefully install other version of packages.        \n\n\n*\n\n*Fist install synaptic package manager if you don't have already installed:\n$ sudo apt-get install synaptic\n\n\n*Then open synaptic package manager -> click Custom Filters down-left -> click Broken top-left, it will list all broken packages(if you have, other wise it will show nothing) try to fix all broken packages. Also if any residual packages are there on more option you will get as residual packages.\n\n*Search for packages you want to downgrade/upgrade, highlight it by simply clicking on it do not mark(tick), chose Package from the menu -> Force Version and chose some other versions from the list. Then click Apply to downgrade/upgrade it. (You may also get that the selected package depends some other package, then search for that package and repeat this step till you fix all)\n\n*now try to install your actually packages, it would install without any problem.\n\n*You can get more help about How to use Synaptic Package Manager\nHope it works for you.\n", "Q: Installing 13.04 with Windows 8 - Secure Boot Failed I have a Sony laptop with UEFI, SecureBoot and Windows 8. I read Ubuntu UEFI recommendations, then freed some 35 gb on system hdd and installed Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit in EFI mode, keeping Windows 8. \nAfter succesfull install, system booted into Windows 8 only, and I used Boot-Repair as recommended. Boot-Repair said that all is ok and here is his log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6061646\nBut now system can not boot totally. Only thing I see is \"Secure Boot Failed/Operating System is Invalid\"\nWhat can I do next to repair Ubuntu and Windows boot?\n\nA: The easiest solution is likely to be to disable Secure Boot. Unfortunately, details of how to do this vary from one computer to another, but all x86-64-based PCs that ship with Windows 8 should give you some means to do that.\nIf you want to keep Secure Boot active, my advice is to upgrade your Secure Boot software; the last I checked, Ubuntu was still using shim version 0.1, whereas the latest available in signed form is version 0.4 (AFAIK, available only as a Fedora package). Even version 0.2 (available from Fedora, OpenSUSE, and Matthew Garrett) is better than version 0.1. See here for a fuller description of how to install shim \"from scratch.\" (Unfortunately, the process is rather involved.) There's also the possibility of switching to PreLoader, which is easier to install and configure than shim, but more limiting in various ways.\n", "Q: Expand RAID array I'm pretty new to RAID, so please forgive my silly question.\nI have an Ubuntu Server 12.04 x64 installed on a pc having 4 hdds.\nDuring RAID setup I selected RAID10 and (my ignorance) choose 2 active hdds and 2 spare hdds.

For a while, Ctrl+\\ worked like a charm. Now, it does not kill the process. In fact it does nothing.\nAn example how it does NOT work:\nadi@ebi:~ $ sleep 10\n^C\n\n[exited with 130]\nadi@ebi:~ $ sleep 10\n^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\ \nadi@ebi:~ $\n\nCtrl+C stops sleep as usual, but Ctrl+\\ does not, but it should, right?\n\nA: What Ctrl + \\ does is send SIGQUIT to the foreground process. Some developers want to use SIG* events in a way that the user might not expect or is accustomed to. You didn't mention the program, but lets see my case with Ctrl + \\ and mplayer:\nAO: [pulse] 44100Hz 2ch floatle (4 bytes per sample)\nVideo: no video\nStarting playback...\nA:   1.7 (01.7) of 0.0 (unknown)  0.4% \n// here I press Ctrl + \\\n\nMPlayer interrupted by signal 3 in module: play_audio\nA:   1.0 (00.9) of 0.0 (unknown)  0.4% \n\nExiting... (Quit)\n\nAs you see, mplayer catch the signal, but don't exit immediately. If I had used Ctrl + C it would say \"MPlayer interrupted by signal 2 in module: play_audio\". What I'm trying to explain is that each program can interpret the signals the way they like, without caring for what it is supposed to do. You must review the documentation. Also, remember that SIGKILL or 9 should be resorted as last resource. You must check that the keystrokes are also sent to the process, the keymap is correct and your keyboard is connected.\n\nA: You can list your terminal settings by executing\nstty -a\n\nIt will print out your hotkeys, where \"^\" stands fro Ctrl, e.g mine is:\nintr = ^C; quit = ^\\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>; eol2 = <undef>;\nswtch = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R;\nwerase = ^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O;\n\nCheck man stty to see which special character does what e.g:\nquit CHAR\n          CHAR will send a quit signal\n\nSo \"quit = ^\\\" in my output means that if I press Ctrl+\\ it will send a quit signal (SIGQUIT) to the process. If your stty -a output is different, then you can set it with \nstty quit ^\\\n\nor if you want e.g. Ctrl+K for the SIGQUIT signal use\nstty quit ^k\n\nBut note that every signal except the SIGKILL can be caught by the receiving process so the process can ignore it if it's developer decided to do so. And also I think that using Ctrl+C (SIGINT) is better then using Ctrl+\\ (SIGQUIT), because the default action for both signal is to end the process but in case of SIGQUIT a coredump should also be made, which I think is usually not wanted. \n", "Q: Project to have virtual box guest support by default How do I package ubuntu for virtual box in a ready-to-eat format so I can foist it on every person who owns a laptop? (that way they have NO barrier to use it: neither in the install or the required rebooting for dual boot)\nUbuntu has very poor out-of-the-box performance as a guest in virtual box due to the high dependence on hardware acceleration for it's all important eyecandy/perfectly-purple-pixels. For a usable system the virtualbox VM needs to be configured to allow 3D acceleration and Ubuntu needs specific drivers to benefit from this. How can I go about packaging the whole shebang so noobs get a ready to eat package?\nTarget Group: Noobs who show the slightest curiosity; acquaintances and distant family susceptible to cajoling, coercion and emotional blackmail; anyone with a new machine. More technical users can configure VBox machines themselves, setup dualboots or just ditch windows like I did.\nI posted a question on launchpad a while ago but that is gathering dust.. (https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/232004)\nIdeally I would like the Ubuntu iso to contain the drivers to support virtual box, since it too is an important \"platform\". My questions are :\n\n\n*\n\n*The drivers and extensions are under some GPL incompatible opensource license (CDL I think) Is there any technical/legal problem in including them on the iso? (there are ready to use debs on the official ubuntu repo already that use DKMS+source code)\n\n*How can I file a request to include them on the iso? I had no luck on launchpad, either on my own or with my request for guidance.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nThe question has no reduced to \"how do I ask for the virtualbox-guest-additions package to be included by default in the ubuntu 13.10 iso?\"\n\nA: I don't know where you get that idea, but the guest additions, since version 4.0.0, are released under the GPL2 license.\nYou can check it in the source code if your are still in doubt. See this file for an example. Feel free to check others.\nSo don't worry about redistributing them with the rest of VirtualBox.\nAnother complete different matter is the Extension Pack, that contains things like usb2 support. This is not open source software and can't be distributed.\n\nA: To show off Ubuntu a virtual machine is the least alternative I would have thought of. It will leave users with the tragically wrong impression that Ubuntu is a sluggish, slow running, and hence unusuable OS. \nIn addition, other than the guest OS we will also have to configure the host to be able to run a VM fairly well.\nSo your project - as nice as it looks at first glance - will not lead to the desired effect. I would not recommend it, and the effort you will have to put in is not worth it.\nHaving said that, here are some nice guides for alternatives (but you can also get ideas for your project from these guides):\n\n\n*\n\n*How to customize the Ubuntu Live CD?\n\n*How can I make a live CD/DVD from my harddisk installation?\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key?

But what you're limiting is the actual file transfer. I'd guess that Transmission would still update the trackers at a regular interval. That shouldn't be too much data, but if you have many active torrents, it'll grow. Perhaps it keeps updating the list of peers as well. \n", "Q: How to open files and directories using a single click in Lubuntu? Is it possible to configure Lubuntu so that I can open folders or run applications with a single click instead of a double-click? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Yes, you should be able to do so. Open PCManFM which is the default file manager. Click on Edit, Preferences, and then tick \"Open Files with Single Click\". That's all. \n\n\nA: If you prefer to do it through command line (like I had to, due to a small resolution touchscreen and the need to script it for creating additional devices), you can modify the /home/pi/.config/libfm.conf file.\nChange line 5 of this file from single_click=0 to single_click=1.\nYou will be required to restart your machine for this to take affect, so I gave it a sudo reboot after saving the change.\n", "Q: How to enable the menu bar and the status bar in Ubuntu 13.04?

Choose install ubuntu. when it comes to partitioning, don't hesitate to manually partition your hdd, since you don't have to loose any data. Now you create the first Partition. leave the configs alone, just adjust the size and set the mount point to /, so it will be your system partition. \nCreate Partition 2. (again, no config changes, just the size.) If you want to store your data in /home AND /home should be on the second (data) partition, you can set the mount point of partition 2 to /home. If you do so, everything saved in /home/ like your personal settings and files will be on the second partition.\nduring install there's no NTFS-support. At this point that really isn't needed. If you really want to have a NTFS partition, create it later and leave the rest of the HDD-space empty. You can create the partition later during Windows-installation or by installing the NTFS-Tools and a partition manager like gparted . *It is highly recommended to install Windows before ubuntu. Windows DOES NOT create any settings for ubuntu. It will be like you dont have it installed. Ubuntu in the other hand KNOWS all configs for windows and will create a boot manager to choose the booted system automatically on ubuntu install. *\nHope this helped.\n", "Q: Installing on USB stick I have the live system running from USB stick.

Used to be always one too high (e.g. sdc instead of sdb, hd2 instead of hd1) but since 12.04, that seems not to be the  case as consistently.  At the first grub screen when booting the newly created USB, type e to edit the commands, and see what disks are being used -- the uuid will be OK, but any actual device is suspect -- change as necessary.  AT first successful boot, run \nsudo update-grub\n\nto fix things.\n\nFor UEFI machines, you 1)need to make an EFI partition (FAT32, 300M, boot flag) on the USB, and when installing, identify that PARTITION as the boot loader device.  Otherwise, the hard disk's EFI partition will be used (even when giving the target DEVICE as the grub device).\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to gnome-terminal?

There's a somewhat of learning curve for splitting windows, but that is not too bad. Ctrl+a, then :, then type split -h or  split -v. There's also ability to have new tabs/windows with F2 key\n\nBut since it isn't really terminal emulator (as discussed in the comments bellow ), I suggest sakura.

This article covers lot of its features: http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2013/07/hidden-gems-of-xterm.html\n\nA: Starting from GNOME 42, a new terminal, called Console, is available. It is an alternative to Ubuntu’s default GNOME Terminal. It is not a 1:1 replacement, it is designed to be a simple terminal emulator for the average user to carry out simple CLI tasks and aims to be a ‘core’ app for GNOME.\nAccording to a dedicated news from OMG! Ubuntu!, probably GNOME team preferred to create a new terminal for the switch to GTK4 than adapting the GNOME terminal codebase.\nConsole is not automatically installed in Ubuntu 22.04, in fact it is not intended for GNOME Terminal/Tilix replacement: according to the GitLab page \"Console aims to serve the casual linux user who rarely needs a terminal.\"\nConsole is available in the jammy universe repo and may be installed by running the command:\nsudo apt install gnome-console\nPicture from OMG!

I am loath to follow their instructions as I have had problems manually configuring the graphics driver of other Linux machines. Is there a graphical tool like Additional Drivers which could be used instead?\n\nA: I solved my problem however, the solution was that there was an unusual error in the openGL code I was running. It failed because it could not find the required fonts not because of graphical issues. Because of the way the c-based OGL and font calls were embedded into python code, this was difficult to track down.\nIn the process of discovering this I tried several things including upgrading to the proprietary graphics drivers. I would Not recommend this for anyone running an ATI HD graphics card which is not supported by the 13.04+ release of fglrx. You need to downgrade your Xserver and this makes unity run poorly. The proprietary drivers do not add much i could see to the system graphics, though many reported that they have advantages for laptops in terms of power consumption. \nFinally, the GLSL_paralax test from globs failed for non driver-related reasons. \nOverall, all graphics work on my system with the open source drivers. \n", "Q: For Loop Copy Command I have a file, FileToCopy.pbs, that I would like to copy into multiple directories while changing a line called xxx in the file to the pwd location of the directory in which the file is to be copied. \nWhat kind of for loop can I use to make this command?\nAlso, some of my directories include a * at the end of the directory path name. \nMore specifically I have a directory structure:\n/home/path1/dir1\n/home/path1/dir2\n/home/path1/dir3*\n/home/path1/dir4*\n.\n.\netc\n\nand would like to copy FileToCopy.pbs into all directories so that I have:\n/home/path1/dir1/FileToCopy.pbs\n/home/path1/dir2/FileToCopy.pbs\n/home/path1/dir3*/FileToCopy.pbs\n/home/path1/dir4*/FileToCopy.pbs\n\nwhile changing a line xxx in each copied file of FileToCopy.pbs to the directory in which it is in.

Please Help I want to create an external Ubuntu HardDrive but I want to know that is there any way to install it without adding changes to the Boot option menu. I currently have Windows 7 installed on my PC but i don't want a choosing menu (Win7/Ubuntu) each time my PC starts, I want it to be like a plug and play device. Is it possible please reply in steps!\n\nA: The quick answer: If you install Ubuntu on a external USB you will not be prompted to choose your OS everytime you boot your PC. \nThe scenario you are thinking of is when Ubuntu and Windows are both installed on the same harddrive and the GRUB boot menu asks which partition to boot from.\nThis is different when booting form an external drive and is actually handled by the BIOS.\nThis is very system specific so I can't give detailed instruction but here are the steps you want to take. Lets pretend you already have your Ubuntu liveUSB made.\nPower down your computer and connect the external harddrive.\nBoot the computer into the BIOS Boot options menu (this is system specific and is usually done by pressing either the ESC or a F* key during bootup). \nIn this menu there should be an option to boot from USB Drive. Select that and you will boot from the external harddrive.\nTo achieve a plug and play like experience you can do some more messing around in the BIOS. If you go into the BIOS Menu you should have an option to change the boot order. Your internal harddrive should be first (CD might be first). Change this so USB is the first in the boot order. \nNow anytime you boot the PC with the USB plugged in it will automatically boot from the external harddrive, if it finds a bootable device.\nNote: Much of this deals with your BIOS and is system specific and not really Ubuntu related. \n\nA: There might a setting in the BIOS to allow booting from external drives - press F2 or whatever it is on your computer to enter the setup. \nIf you want to boot to multiple Operating Systems, you may need something like Grub or Grub2 installed to allow a the selection of which System to boot.\nI am not experienced in this area - try searching for 'dual booting' on Wikipedia or Google, or on the forum.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu Touch support multiple users? Why can't Ubuntu mobile os support multiple users just like the desktop edition, capability of creating multiple user accounts. What is it that Ubuntu desktop OS support multiple accounts and not in Ubuntu mobile OS? I know the one is meant for a mobile devices and the other desktop pc? So in general whats the difference between two? Thanks very much. \n\nA: I'm pretty sure that the reason multiple users is not available in Ubuntu Touch is that it is an operating system mainly for phones and tablets and those are usually just used by one person.  Ubuntu Desktop does support multiple accounts because sometimes families just own computer and all the people in the family use just that one with separate accounts  But I see your point.  It would be good to have multiple users, especially on tablets.\n", "Q: Can I make a 'Virtualbox' Guest OS see and use directories and files from the Host OS?

I have installed few software in Ubuntu. Some of these software are quite big and needs more than 400MB of space during installation. In Windows, when we install a software, it is saved in program files, where we can see all the files.\nWhat is the path of the equivalent location for Ubuntu? I mean, in which path, I can see that, there is a folder for that particular application and entering that, I can see all 400MB+ data.\n\nA: Linux programs are commonly using shared libraries, so the program install size is dependant of what libraries it would need. So there is not a way to see all installed stuff in one directory. But you can query files that are owned by package with:\ndpkg -L <package_name>\n\nfor example you installed samba, you could query it's files by:\ndpkg -L samba\n\nHope that helps?

In it, either map all system accounts that don't have a real inbox to another:\n/^\\(root\\|postmaster\\|postfix|etc\\)@domain\\.example$/ person@domain.example\n\nor map all accounts that aren't known real inboxes (do not indent the if):\nif /@domain\\.example$/\n!/^\\(person\\|anotherperson\\|peeps\\)@/ person@domain.example\nendif\n\nThis is a lot easier if your myorigin setting in /etc/postfix/main.cf is different to your real inbox domains (e.g. a subdomain of mail.domain.example) as then you can match everything like so:\n/@mail\\.domain\\.example$/ person@domain.example\n\nAs others said, do not run postmap on this file, and delete /etc/postfix/virtual-regexp.db if it exists.\nUse the new mapping by adding\nlocal_recipient_maps =\nvirtual_alias_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/virtual-regexp\n\nto /etc/postfix/main.cf.\n\nI also added\nroot: person@domain.example\n\nto /etc/aliases and ran the newaliases command, but I think Postfix's virtual alias configuration overrides it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Dell Studio 1537 I have been trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 64bit onto my dell studio 1537.\n I downloaded the Iso, and burned it to a disk, and then I inserted the disk into the dell studio.

I have been doing small bits of research and have found out that the dell studio 1537 should be able to run 64bit versions of OS's/ distributions.\n  Any thoughts on what I could be doing wrong? Should I just try and boot the 32bit version instead? Idk? If anyone could help it would be much appreciated. I am a windows user and I want to get into using Linux so I am starting out with the desktop version until I can learn a little more. \n\nA: Is your computer capable of booting from DVD/CD drive? Most like it can. Is it configured to do so? Sometimes by default it does not. You may have to enable it.\nDo a complete shutdown power off. Boot from no power. Some codes will show up listing memory and devices in ugly big text before you get into anything with graphics like the Windoos logo. Options will be usually listed on the bottom like < F2 > for System Rom or < F10 > Boot Manager or something similar. Be aware, some systems like Dell/Gateway/BigCompany install several boot up ROM utilities.\nSounds like you have some problems creating bootable media. If it was a 32/64bit problem, you would still be able to see a bootup from the installation media, and mostly likely a error message to that effect.

There's a small chance this will work, otherwise you'll have to re-install Ubuntu. \nIf the data on there is important, I would strongly suggest giving this job to a data recovery professional.

Archive Manager does usually place temporary files in beginning with .fr or fr (fr for file-roller probably). File roller also leaves these temporary folders in other places (usually when it is interrupted).\nAlso, for clearing disk space in general you can use baobab to scan for what files and folders are taking up space, or bleachbit to clear the cache, temporary files etc made by other programs.\nThis seems to be a common issue, so I would suggest filing a bug against the file-roller package here or 'upstream' here (there is a existing similar bug here - however it may be a issue related to Totem and/or using File Roller with Totem).\n", "Q: Error when phablet-flash -b I follow the instruction here http://blog.desdelinux.net/como-instalar-ubuntu-touch/.\nBut when I try phablet-flash -b throw the follow error:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/phablet-flash\", line 22, in <module>\n    from phabletutils import arguments\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/phabletutils/arguments.py\", line 23, in <module>\n    from phabletutils import cdimage\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/phabletutils/cdimage.py\", line 25, in <module>\n    from phabletutils import fileutils\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/phabletutils/fileutils.py\", line 20, in <module>\n    import lzma\nImportError: No module named lzma\n\n\nA: It's a known issue we just noticed, for the time being do:\n\nsudo apt-get install python-lzma\n\nThat'll install the missing python module.\n", "Q: Comparing two DVDs How to compare two DVDs?

However, when I switched to wifi, I cannot print even the test page though I can connect to the printer(ping is OK). By the way, it does work when I print on Windows 7, no matter I use wired or wireless network. \nSo did anyone experience this situation before? Is it caused by mis-configuration or just a bug of Ubuntu? Thanks for your help!\n\nA: I haven't experienced this before, but here are some possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your router is filtering the port required for printer communication. Less likely because of the test case with your Windows test case, but still possibly worth a try. Perhaps look on Google for similar cases with communication issues pertaining to your particular router, but not necessarily to do with that printer or OS.\n\n*A firewall on your Ubuntu machine is blocking communication on the wireless network. Especially in the case of Windows, security is usually increased over wireless communication versus wired, for obvious reasons.\n\n*The authentication method pertaining to your printer setup isn't compatible with Ubuntu's wireless management system. Another unlikely possibility, but still one that could be considered. This could also be a driver-related problem for the printer and/or the computer's wireless chipset.\n\n\nSome possible fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Print a configuration details page using your printer's physical panel. This will give you an idea of how it's configured, and possibly point out any mis-configured or conflicting settings.\n\n*Run nmap <printer-ip>. This should give you an idea of the ports used by the printer, and will give you a listing of the protocols used by the printer. Note that if you run this on your wired network, and then compare it to the results when run on your wireless network, you might get a good idea of which ports cannot be accessed wirelessly. (Note that you'll usually have to run sudo apt-get install nmap on a stock system.\n\n*Run /usr/lib/cups/backend/snmp and sudo /usr/lib/cups/backend/dnssd. These will tell you whether your printer has been discovered by CUPS or system-config-printer, and other details.\n\n\nIf the suggestions above haven't helped you solve the problem, or you'd like more details (source of info): DebuggingPrinterProblems\n", "Q: How to add virtual ram on Ubuntu I was just trying to play some games on Ubuntu with a 2 GB RAM and it does not run very well. Is there any way I could add virtual RAM from a flash drive?\n\nA: I'm guessing you're drawing this idea from Microsoft's ReadyBoost implementation in the Windows line.\n\nReadyBoost works in conjunction with SuperFetch. SuperFetch, also introduced in Windows Vista, monitors the programs you use on your computer and automatically loads their application files and libraries into your computer’s memory (RAM) ahead of time. When you launch the application, it will start faster — your computer reads its files from memory, which is faster, instead of from disk, which is slower. Empty RAM doesn’t do any good, so using it as a cache for frequently accessed applications can increase your computer’s responsiveness.\nSuperFetch normally uses your computer’s memory – it caches these files in your RAM. However, SuperFetch can also work with a USB stick – that’s ReadyBoost in action. When you connect a USB drive to your computer and enable ReadyBoost, Windows will store SuperFetch data on your USB drive, freeing up system memory. It’s faster to read various small files from your USB stick than it is to read them from your hard drive, so this can theoretically improve your system’s performance.\n\nHTG Explains: Is ReadyBoost Worth Using?\nIf you were to treat your flash drive as RAM, your computer would be depending on it as though it had the same access speeds as RAM. This introduces the possibility of your computer actually waiting for data to be read/written to/from this \"RAM\" before moving on and performing the next task. As you should be able to tell, this may actually end up slowing your computer down rather than speeding it up.\nWhile it would be a very interesting experiment, it's probably not what you're looking for. You'd be better off adding more RAM, but only if the RAM is the culprit of the problem. Perhaps perform some testing before going out and spending money on it.\n\nA: To enable 4Gb swap file additionally to your Random Access Memory(RAM) do this:\n# dd if=/dev/zero of=/usb/virtualram bs=1GB count=4\n4+0 records in\n4+0 records out\n4000000000 bytes (4.0 GB) copied, 22.7394 s, 176 MB/s\n\n# mkswap /usb/virtualram \nSetting up swapspace version 1, size = 3906244 KiB\nno label, UUID=0a601c3f-6a37-46d9-92f0-8a43303f687b\n\n# swapon -f /usb/virtualram\n\n# swapon -s\nFilename                                Type            Size    Used    Priority\n/usb/virtualram                     file            3906244 0       0\n\n# free\n\n", "Q: Remove output from add-apt-repository I'm trying to write a shell script that will automatically set-up a LAMP stack for me.

Will I be able to have putty use port 443 at school (outgoing connection) and then connect to port 22 on my home router?\n\nA: I think it could be as simple as forwarding your router port 443 to your computer port 22.... Then you configure PuTTy to connect to your IP / your server name over port 443.... unless I am missing something else.\n\nA: Do port forwarding on your home router, for example map router (public IP curl ifconfig.me to get it) port 2222 (as long as it is NOT blocked) to your server LAN IP's port 22.\n\nNOTE: Similar to VirtualBox NAT Port Forwarding Rules if you have played with VirtualBox before.\n\nThen at school you can use ssh -p 2222 user@ROUTER_PUBLIC_IP or putty (specific 2222 instead of 22) and ssh to you home server.\n\nNOTE: avoid using common ports like 8080, 443 as it may already be in use by the router.\n\n\nA: An Nmap scan doesn't necessarily give you a 100% accurate picutre of what ports are blocked on a firewall.  You can't simply scan the network interface of the firewall to discern the rules.  You need to pass traffic through the firewall to do that.  So you could use Nmap with a host on the Internet and then scan the IP of that hose, which would in turn send traffic through the firewall and exercise any port blocking rules.  But you'd need something on the other end like wireshark to validate for sure whether the packets made it there because simply getting a SYN/ACK back doesn't prove things 100%.\nThe easiest way to test for blocked outbound ports is with IsMyPortBlocked.\nYou can manual tests that will cause traffic to be send from the IsMyPortBlocked Java applet (which downloads to your PC) out to the server, over each specified port.\n", "Q: How to Fix Error ata1.00: failed to enable AA (0x1 = error_mask I have a lenovo z 480 and half of the time ubuntu will not boot, only displays this error message\nError ata1.00: failed to enable AA (error_mask = 0x1\n\nand sometimes the screen goes black with blinking cursor.

I'm currently running Ubuntu 13.04, and I've got a Windows 8 VirtualBox VM installed.  I put the VM's folder in a shared folder (/home/sharedHome/) that has read and write permissions assigned to the vboxusers group.  This allows me to launch the VM from my account and my wife can launch it from hers.\nThe only problem is that when you launch the VM from either account, the permissions get changed so that only that user has read and write privileges on the .vbox file.  After this happens, the other account can't launch the VM unless I go in and change the permissions again.\nDoes anyone know how to prevent VirtualBox from changing the permissions?  Is there a better way to share a VM between users?\nThanks!\n\nA: Here's some conjecture based on the VirtualBox Special Image Write Modes documentation and particularly the warning for sharable hard disk images:\n\nWarning This is an expert feature, and misuse can lead to data loss -- regular filesystems are not prepared to handle simultaneous changes by several parties.\n\nI'm guessing the mode changing is done to make accidental sharing of an image less likely. It should be obvious that chaos would reign if you were to both run the VM at the same time, and changing permissions seems like a cheap-and-easy way to make that less likely to happen my accident.\nThis does make me wonder what benefit of sharing a VM you are hoping to realize. Why would cloning the base image and using host (not guest) storage for user data files not satisfy? Yes, I know that a Windows installation is absurdly large for compared to an equivalent Ubuntu installation, but you might be trying to out-clever yourself on this one.\nIs this even an answer? You decide.\n\nA: I had the same requirements (VM shared between two users) and the same problem (.vbox file with rw permission only to the last user of the VM).\nTo workaround this issue I created a vbox file for each user in the same folder (lets call them, for instance, xp_user1.vbox and xp_user2.vbox).\nThis would be the procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*(user1) Create the VM. The VM, its snapshots and the .vbox file have to be stored in a directory that can be accessed by both users (File|Preferences, Machine|Configuration).\n\n*(user2) Create the .vbox copy:\ncp xp_user1.vbox xp_user2.vbox\n\n*(user2) Create the shared VM\nSelect the Machine|Add... menu item, navigate to the xp_user2.vbox location, and select that file.\nIn File|Preferences, set the default machine path to the .vbox location\nConsiderations:\n\n\n*\n\n*If a snapshot is taken, the .vbox copy has to be updated\n\n*If one user restores a snapshot, the previous active one looses rw permissions for the other user. Assuming both users belong to the same group:\nchmod 0660 snapshot\n\n\n*I tried to store the .vbox files at different directories but it did not work (location issues).\n", "Q: Need library libgthread-2.0 / found lib, now getting 'wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64' Trying to run a teamspeak client, getting:\n./ts3client_linux_x86: error while loading shared libraries: libgthread-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nlibgthread doesn't seem to be included in glibc anymore, I can't change versions of the package - too much depends on it, anywhere I can get my mitts on this file/build this file?\n\nA: Recomended method, from the repositories\nYou don't need for anything TeamSpeak from the download pages.

As I need the DE layout only for Umlaute, I found the solution with modifying the keys in ~/.Xmodmap. The command xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap changes my US layout in the desired way. But it has a side effect, it also changes my BG layout - the Euro sign is the default sigh for the key e. How can I apply the command only for the US layout?\n\nA: I had a similar problem but where I needed to map a certain key to \"n\" in my English layout and \"ν\" (the Greek letter for \"n\") in my Greek layout.  I was using xmodmap -e \"keycode 24 = n\" to remap the English key, but then the \"q\" key (key code 24) did nothing in my Greek layout rather than printing \"ν\" as desired.\nEventually, I found out that you can map the same key code to multiple keysym values like this: xmodmap -e \"keycode 24 = n N Greek_nu Greek_NU\".  The first one is the the default value, the second is when \"shift\" is applied, the third is the default for my secondary layout, and the fourth is for when \"shift\" is applies to my secondary layout.\nIn order to find the correct order and keysym name, you can enter xmodmap -pk in the terminal to print a table with your present key map.  The names for each key code will be in parenthesis and in the order that they will need to appear in your xmodmap -e command.  For example, my table for the original \"n\" key (which is broken) is\n57       0x006e (n)  0x004e (N)  0x07ed (Greek_nu)   0x07cd (Greek_NU)\nwhich is how I knew to have \"n N Greek_nu Greek_NU\" in that order.\nFor your case, I'd imagine that all you'd have to do is set the first two values to be what you want for your English layout, and then the next four (since you have three layouts) to be their original values.\n", "Q: How can I run owncloud?

But not all are available there. Also if available you have to enable it. You can always add any available libraries to your list: Wine Configuration -> Libraries -> New Override for libraries -> Add -> Edit -> Builtin(wine)\nBut adding each and every libraries is somewhat a tedious task.\nI am providing following link which will help you to use all available libraries and also install DirectX so that you can use missed libraries:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install DirectX in Wine and use all available libraries\nSince it is a very long process, it is fairly not possible for me to describe each steps here. So should go to the above link and follow the steps. \nHope it works for you..\n\nA: Wine contains its own implementation of the DirectX libraries, with Direct3D 9 compatibility. Nevertheless, this implementation is not yet complete and causes issues with some games. Therefore, the answer to your question depends on the game you want to play. \nI'd start without installing DirectX (relying on wines DirectX) and if the game does not run, use winetricks to install certain Microsoft d3dx9*.dll files (or the full DirectX, but that often causes more troubles than it resolves). \nA good starting point to find out if a particular game requires DirectX libraries is the wine application database. Usually other users describe which dlls they needed to install to get the game running.\nAnother important thing: Since it depends on the game, whether or not certain DLL files are needed, it's good practise to install all games in separate WINEPREFIXes (see man wine) or use a tool that does this for you, like playonlinux or crossover. Another option would be to install to the same wineprefix but set up DLL overrides for each game executable, but this can be cumbersome in certain cases (think of a game consisting of more than one executable file).\n", "Q: How to run mysql command from terminal?

[Yeah! Congratulations!]\nYou have enough swap, but it's not turned 'on' (or mounted). Please post the result of blkid\nIf you have a swap partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*Add the line at the end: \nUUID=[the-uuid-of-swap-from-blkid]   none    swap    sw  0   0\n\n*Also follow these instructions:\nSwapFAQ\nIf you have a swapfile, go to: Use swapfile instead of partition and hibernate\nUPDATE-1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Gparted.\n\n*Right-click on /dev/sda5 and click on 'swapoff' or 'delete'.\n\n*Click on the 'tick' above the Disk-image.\n\n*Now, right-click, and click 'new'. Create a 'swap' partition. Repeat #3.\n\n*Click on 'information' on /dev/sda5.\n\n*Note the UUID. Replace the UUID in your fstab (4th line from bottom, the one after 'swap was...'.\n\n*Run sudo -b gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Find the line \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=...\"\nand add to it \"resume=UUID=\" (leave the old text as it was)\n\n*sudo update-grub\n\n*sudo update-initramfs -u\nFor blkid issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart\n\n*sudo update-grub\n", "Q: vi /etc/network/interfaces no such file or directory When I install initial configuration in Ubuntu 12.04 Server, I type this command to change the network interface card (NIC) from using DHCP to a static IP:\nvi /etc/network/interfaces\n\nout put  is :\nvi /etc/network/interfaces  no such file or directory \n\nShould I create this directory or what ? \n\nA: You must leave a space between vi and the file so it should be \nvi /etc/network/interfaces\nAlso , in order for you to change that file, you need to be root so i would suggest you put  it as sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces.

So \nrename -nv 's/^\\d+_-_//;s/_/ /g' *.avi\n\nThe -n makes it run in test (dry run) mode - test it in your directory and if you are happy that it's doing the right thing, run it without the n\n\nA: You can use the following command:\nrename 's/[0-9]+_-_//; s/_/\\ /g' *\n\n", "Q: Internet not working on Ubuntu 13.04 Suddenly internet stopped working on my ubuntu 13.04 system.

It is safe so no need to worry.\nFollow these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*First take a backup of /etc/network/interfaces\nsudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.back\n\n\n*Open /etc/network/interfaces by sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces and replace the contents with this:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\n\n\n*Save and close geditand execute following command:\nsudo ifup eth1\n\n\n*Try to connect again, also try to restart you system once.\n\n*If it doesn't work then I am sorry! this would not be your solution. Replace your new /etc/network/interfaces file with old one: /etc/network/interfaces.back:\nsudo mv /etc/network/interfaces.back /etc/network/interfaces\n\nReply what happens.\n", "Q: How to fix sudo after “chmod -R 777 /var”? I executed chmod 777  /var and now Ubuntu won't start, can anyone tell me what I did wrong? And if there is a way of going back?\n\nA: This is a security issue: inside /var are files that never are accepted when set to executable for \"the whole world\" (the 3rd 7 in your command). \nIf you did -not- use -R with that command this should fix it:\nsudo chmod 755 /var\n\nFor future reference please read this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why shouldn't /var/www have chmod 777\n", "Q: Difference between phablet-flash cdimage-touch and phablet-flash ubuntu-system? I always used the method: phablet-flash cdimage-touch for updating to the newest version.\nBut there is also the possibility to use: phablet-flash ubuntu-system.\nSo my question is: Where is the difference between \"cdimage\" and \"ubuntu-system\"?\nAre there any pros or cons?\n\nA: *\n\n*cdimage-touch\n\nProvisions the device with a CDimage build of Ubuntu Touch.\n\n*\n\n*cdimage-legacy\n\nProvisions the device with legacy unflipped images. These images really shouldn't be used anymore, but it's a good time machine.\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-system\n\nProvisions the device with an Ubuntu Image Based Upgrade image. If you still don't know what this is, refer to Stephane's blog post or the wiki describing it.\nFrom the link:\n\nSome of you may be aware that I along with Barry Warsaw and Ondrej Kubik have been working on image based upgrades for Ubuntu Touch. This is going to be the official method to update any Ubuntu Touch devices. When using this system, the system will effectively be read-only with updates being downloaded over the air from a central server and applied in a consistent way across all devices. Design details may be found at: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/ImageBasedUpgrades\nAfter several months of careful design and implementation, we are now ready to get more testers. We are producing daily images for our 4 usual devices, Galaxy Nexus (maguro), Nexus 4 (mako), Nexus 7 (grouper) and Nexus 10 (manta). At this point, only those devices are supported. We’ll soon be working with the various ports to see how to get them running on the new system.\n\n\n*\n\n*community\n\nProvisions the device with a community supported build. Community based images as described by Daniel on his blog. In a nutshell, each porter provides a manifest of where their ports are located and the are provisioned to the target devices, this currently only works with recovery images that support extendedcommands. Support for openrecoverscript is one of the close targets.\n\nubuntu-system will be the official one. So this is better support, regular updates and easier setup.\n", "Q: After installing Ubuntu Boot screen NO CABLE CONNECTION!

Does the system boot up if you leave the USB drive plugged in after install and reboot?\nIf so, try installing with the default partitioning (you can always repartition later) or make sure to choose the correct device for boot loader when creating the partitioning.\n", "Q: removing SpiderOak SpiderOak removing FAQ says that i need to delete the ~/.SpiderOak folder. I have uninstalled the application but I don't want to go deleting things and mess something up. Can someone please give a set by step guide on how to do this?\n\nA: if you delete the ~/.SpiderOak folder mentioned in SpiderOak's website, you will merely remove a particular user from SpiderOak but you won't affect its performance. Please notice that, as for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and SpiderOak 5.1.3, the old ~/.SpiderOak folder  is now located at ~/.config/SpiderOak\nAs for the procedure, you need to open Terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and execute this command:\nrm -r ~/.SpiderOak\n\nThat will delete the ~/.SpiderOak folder and all its contents. Conversely, if you are using a more recent version, you need to delete the ~/.config/SpiderOak folder instead:\nrm -r ~/.config/SpiderOak\n\n", "Q: Can i backup Ubuntu Windows Installation? I have Ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso and wanted to install  it within Windows. I found out the Ubuntu recognized my wireless device without even installing any drivers, which i didn't see in Linux Mint 15, so i plan to install this Ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386 within Windows and update it quickly and make a backup of this Ubuntu.\nIs it possible to do so? since this will be installed within Windows.\nAny suggestions are welcome.\n\nA: The Ubuntu installation is stored on a virtual disk on the windows file system. From the windows point of view the virtual disk containing the Linux install is just another file. So the easiest way is probably to make a backup from the windows side. Locate the file and copy it to a external medium. It probably resides in the folder C:\\Ubuntu\\disks. \nYou might want to have a look at this URL: \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\n", "Q: Does file /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-clone exist and if so, what is the difference to /etc/apt/sources.list? I know that /etc/apt/sources.list is used to tell the apt ubuntu/debian package system about the packages it should use. This is quite clear already.\nBut I have seen that there is a file /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-clone and I was wondering what it is? Is this file only present on my system (which is 12.04 precise)?\nIt seems indeed to be a copy of the file /etc/apt/sources.list.\nIn case the file exists in all 12.04 versions, what purpose does it serve?\n\nA: This file was created by apt-clone:\n\napt-clone is the command-line tool for handling packages, and  may  be\n         considered  the  user's \"front-end\" to the apt-get(8). It manages GRUB\n         menu and ZFS 'syspool' filesystems. Two upgrade methods supported:  1)\n         safe  upgrades via cloning a currently active filesystem and later ch-\n         rooting into it to  perform  actual  upgrade  operation;  2)  in-place\n         (live)  upgrades  by checkpointing a currently active filesystem prior\n         to any upgrade modifications done by apt-get utility.\n\nIn one moment you used, or your OEM used apt-clone for cloning your current packages, and that file was left behind. If you don't use apt-clone anymore you can delete it without problems.\n", "Q: how to extract tar.7z files from command line? Is there a way to extract files of tar.7z format using command line tools in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes - the package p7zip / p7zip-full provides a command-line application to zip/unzip 7z files. The command is simply 7z.\nYou can combine a 7z / tar call using a pipe:\n7z x -so yourfile.tar.7z | tar xf - -C target_dir\n\nwhere target_dir is a already-existing directory. \n\nA: *\n\n*Install p7zip-full if not already installed:\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-full\n\n\n*execute this command to extract .tar.7z file(go to directory where is your file, if myfile.tar.7z is your file name):\n7za x myfile.tar.7z\ntar -xvf myfile.tar\n\n\n*That's it. Actually first command extracts in .tar file then next command extracts it completely.\n\nA: Make sure that 7zip is installed, if not, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install p7zip\n\nTo install the command line utility do:\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-full\n\nOnce done you can do the following to extract:\n7z e <file_name>.tar.7z\n\nTo extract with full paths:\n7z x <file_name>.tar.7z\n\nTo specify a path to extract to:\n7z x <file_name>.tar.7z -opath\n\n7z does not allow spaces between -o and path.\n", "Q: is it true that Chromium uses more cpu than firefox? Hi I was a firefox user but I switched to Chromium a while ago and I feel like Chrome uses uses more cpu browsing the web than firefox...\nI have this psensor app installed on my ubuntu 12.10 which I constantly check and I can tell I feel like FF is better for the sake of my laptop because I spend a lot of time browsing the web. even though I disabled loading flash and plugins while browsing the web but I still feel like chromium is overusing the cpu...`\nfor the record I don't have any heavy plugins so it's not the plugins which wastes cpu...\nI heard that chromium is not officially supported that's why it may have a poor performance compared to firefox although I get every available chromium update...\nshould I switch back to FF? I'm hooked with chromeuim deeply ,that won't be near anything easy...\n\nA: Chromium will use more memory then Firefox as the amount of tabs goes up (this is by design).\nWhile running Chromium press Shift+ESC to bring up the chromium task manager. Click the 'Stats for Nerds' button and see which process in Chrome is using the most memory. You can use this to check what memory is used.\nA few graphs from Tom's hardware \"Web Browser Grand Prix 9: Chrome 17, Firefox 10, And Ubuntu\"\n\nWe use the Internet's Top 40 Web sites (according to Quantcast) for our memory and page load reliability testing. Unlike our startup and page load times, this test uses live sites; the test sites are not hosted on our local Web server.\nChrome's memory usage is measured through its about:memory flag, while the other browsers are measured with the Windows Task Manager/Ubuntu System Monitor. Each browser is opened with the Google homepage as the only tab. Memory usage is recorded, and then the additional 39 tabs are loaded. Once all tabs report as loaded, we inspect each page for broken elements and reload any pages that have not opened properly before recording the 40-tab memory usage.\nNext we close all tabs except the original one containing Google's homepage and re-record the memory totals. Finally, we wait two minutes and record the final memory usage figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis test is from 2012 but the numbers still seem to stand. The only thing this does not cover is the usage of HTML5.\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Internet Explorer and Chrome are the winners during periods of light usage. They also seem to manage memory best. Safari and Firefox shine more prominently during heavy loads. Chrome and IE9, however, are hogs when it comes to heavy use, and Opera for Linux demonstrates poor management.\n\nMy opinion:\nStick with the browser you -like- and works for your.\n\nA: Can't compare a running browser and memory management of a browser. Those are two different things. Considering the fact PC's today are so fast the entire argument of memory management is just mute. I would argue it is more about stability of these browsers than speed.\n", "Q: Why is my Hard drive recognised as removable? I have 2 samsung 840s in my computer, one boot and the other expanded storage but Ubuntu recognizes the second as a removable drive but I want them both to be recognised as internal drives, how do I get it to mount as an internal drive?\n\nA: You have to enter your 2nd hard disk information to /etc/fstab file. Then your 2nd hard disk will be treated by internal hard drive.\nJust go for following step:\n\n\n*\n\n*First take back up of /etc/fstab and unmount all 2nd HDD partitions\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup\nsudo umount /dev/sdb*\n\n\n*Execute following command to get your 2nd HDD UUID information that will help you to configure /etc/fstab file.\nsudo blkid\n\nSearch for your 2nd hard disk UUID of all partitions. Your 2nd HDD partitions shouls be displayed like: /dev/sdb1: LABEL=\"Backup\" UUID=\"00A0CE7EA0CE7A24\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" and so on. It is just an example but format will be same.\n\n*Now copy the UUID of the partitions of 2nd HDD which you want to insert in /etc/fstab file.\n\n*Now open /etc/fstab file and insert entry for your HDD partitions on the last line of /etc/fstab file. Take help from previous entry, for format etc:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nWhen opened your entry would be like this:\nUUID=<your_UUID_for_2nd HDD partitions> /media/<location_where_you_want_to_mount>             ntfs    errors=remount-ro 0\n\nJust an example:\nUUID=00A0CE7EA0CE7A24 /media/Backup               ntfs    errors=remount-ro 0\n\n*Now create location where to mount your 2nd HDD partitions.

It installed the Apache nicely and it is running successfully but there is one problem which is a huge one. I do not have permissions to Write to /var/www folder although I am Administrator. The current owner of that www folder is root. I have installed Ubuntu today so I don't know much about it. I have used chown command but it throws error : Operation not permitted.\nCan anybody tell me so that I can have Read & Write permissions?\n\nA: It is not advisable to change the ownership of the /var/www folder, leave it as root. If you need to create new files or folders inside /var/www leave them also under root ownership; or owned by you user if you prefer. For Apache to serve these assets all you need to do is provide read permissions to the www-data user:\nsudo chmod a+r /var/www/my.asset\n\nAlso, consider using instead the /srv folder to store assets that must be served by applications such as Apache. \n\nA: open your terminal and type as\nchmod 744 -R /var/www/\n\nI have faced the issue too and resolved by the above command. hope that helps.\nOnly root user have complete permissions. Normal user and others are only able to read and can not able to write or execute.\nNext with \nchmod 754 -R /var/www/\n\nroot can do everything.

I just want to know if i can write GUI apps for Ubuntu using C--again, not C++. It's just that I hate having to learn a new language entirely (I know that they are similar in some ways but still). Just want to know thanks in advance.\n\nA: You can develop apps for Ubuntu with just about any language. If there are particular libraries you need your app to use, then as mdpc says that's the only thing that would likely impose any restrictions. Some libraries can only be used from certain languages.\nBut Ubuntu apps can be developed in C, and a lot of Ubuntu software is written in C, including many programs and libraries installed by default in almost every Ubuntu system.\nPrograms that are installed by default in Ubuntu or otherwise very popular, and are written in C, include: bash, Brasero, dash, Disks, most of the Document Viewer, Empathy, Evolution, the Eye of GNOME image viewer (src), the File Roller archive manager, GCalctool, GIMP, GNOME Terminal, LightDM, the Nautilus file browser, Pidgin (except some plugins), Rhythmbox, Seahorse (src), Totem, Upstart, and X.org.\nSo yes, you can definitely develop for Ubuntu in C. Many people do.\nWith that said, the Ubuntu SDK uses Qt. Qt has bindings for many languages but not C. So you probably cannot create programs with the Ubuntu SDK, by coding solely in C. (You could still often code most of your software in C.)\nThat may make it difficult to write mobile apps (for Ubuntu Touch) in just C. But there's no need to use the Ubuntu SDK for desktop apps. Many desktop apps (all but 4 apps listed above are desktop apps in the usual sense) that are packaged for and run well in Ubuntu don't use the Ubuntu SDK.\nFurthermore, using the Ubuntu SDK may not be the best way to create portable apps that run well on other desktop operating systems besides Ubuntu. The Ubuntu SDK is good for many purposes, but even if it did support writing apps in C, you'd still likely not use it under a variety of circumstances.\nOne popular way to write GUI applications in C is to use Gtk+. There are other alternatives for GUI toolkits with C bindings, including WxWidgets (via WxC), IUP, and possibly Clutter (GObject is accessible from C but sometimes writing for its object model--or any object model--is difficult in C).\n", "Q: I want to execute a terminal command using php? I have tried exec, shell_exec, system, but they didn't work for me. The command I want to execute is as follows:\n./toolkits/collaborative_filtering/svdpp --training=/home/zubair/graphchi_v0.2.6/graphchi/smallnetflix_mm.train.txt --validation=/home/zubair/graphchi_v0.2.6/graphchi/smallnetflix_mm.validate.txt --binary_relevance_thresh=4 --sgd_gamma=1e-6 --max_iter=30 --quiet=1 --sgd_step_dec=0.9999 --sgd_lambda=1e-6 --D=3 --minival=1 --maxval=10`\n\n\nA: Since php is not a compiled language, you can't execute it directly.  You must tell the system how to open it, just like a shell script.\nWith a shell script, you can run it using sh filename, or bash filename.    Another way is to write the script with a special comment line at the top, called a \"sha-bang\", or \"crash-bang\"; for a bash script, it's like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nYou can then make the file executable, and execute it like a normal program.\nYou can do the same for php.  Either run it under php, if you have it (php xxx.php), or add the sha-bang, but make it say /bin/php rather than /bin/bash\n", "Q: Gedit select text and just highlight it plugin Does anyone know how to highlight some text or change its color in Gedit 3.4.1?\nI have a list of features or modules to include in my project and I just want to mark each as solved when am done with it.

So, I'm using ubuntu 13.04. My webcam is an integrated ASUS.\nAnd I don't really know what I'm doing. If there is some software that would allow me to, like flip my video (Like many cam for ubuntu) or some command that I could use that would just intercept the data from my webcam and flip it then I'd love you.\n\nA: The real problem is that webcam often is mounted upside down.  It is a driver job to reverse the image, so if you have this kind of problem it means there is something from with the webcam driver.

Note that user must be an existing user. I have done this myself on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and it works:\nsudo usermod -a -G netdev <user>\n\nafter this command, check whether user got added by doing:\nid <user>\n\nif not added, try restarting/logging out and do above command (id) again\nWARNING: do NOT omit '-a' in first command. Be careful\n\nA: You can permit a user to run specific tool with root privilege by editing /etc/sudoers file. For example you can permit a non-root non-sudoer user to run only ifconfig command, so he/she can't access root privileged things like viewing /etc/shadow. \nSo, create a normal user (MYUSER in my example). Don't add it to root or sudo groups. Edit /etc/sudoers with your favorite editor like vim. Add this line under # User privilege specification:\nMYUSER    ALL=(root) NOPASSWD :/sbin/ifconfig *\n\nThen access ifconfig using sudo when logged in as MYUSER. For example:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 down \n\nReplace ifconfig in this answer with any tool you want like tcpdump, tshark, etc. \nReference is here.\n\nA: Add user to the \"netdev\" group:\nuseradd -G netdev dedunud\n\n\nA: In Wireshark, there is a group which users can be added to in order to capture packets, for example. This had to be implemented. (Unless I misremembered)\nMaybe you could combine the IDS with tshark / wireshark.\nOtherwise, it could be a bit harder (maybe see how they did that?)\n", "Q: Intel Haswell strange graphics and boot issue I build a new system with a Core i5-4570S CPU and I use the internal graphics card.\nI can Install Ubuntu 13.04 without problem and everything seems to work fine, but during boot and when I turn the PC off I see some really strange colors on the screen, kind of blue and the colors seem to be moving.\nDo I have to worry about this?

I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 on a Lenovo X220.\nMy computer locks up half a dozen times a week. \nMusic still plays from the speakers (Rhythmbox)\nCTRL+ALT+F1 does nothing.\nUnplugging the second monitor does nothing. Unpluging peripherals does nothing. \nI am forced to hard reboot using the power button.\nI want to report this as a crash, or at least as a severe problem.  \nHow can I do this in a way that is useful to somebody?\n\nA: I recommend reporting this as a bug. (This question also has some good information about bug reporting.) Reporting this sort of problem as a bug has the potential to help the Ubuntu project significantly.\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? may help, but whether or not it does, reporting this as a bug is probably your best bet--even if it's not fixed, the troubleshooting that can take place in a bug report may lead to a workaround.\nAs you'll read (in the first two linked resources), effective bug reporting for Ubuntu requires identification of a package that you believe contains the affected (buggy) software.\nMost of the time, when Ctrl+Alt+F1 has no effect, it is a kernel bug--sometimes a kernel panic (which is when the kernel \"crashes\" and has to stop, so the whole system stops working), sometimes other kernel or driver problems. I believe it is also possible for some graphical interface problems (with the X Server, xserver-org) to cause this, though usually a GUI problem won't prevent Ctrl+Alt+F1 from working.\nSo, I recommend reporting this as a kernel bug. To do that, after reading at least that guide, run this command in the system where the problem occurs:\nubuntu-bug linux\n\nThat will automatically send a large amount of potentially useful technical information to Launchpad, and will automatically open up a new browser window/tab where you can write your bug report, describing the problem in as much detail as possible (this is explained more fully in that guide).\nIn particular, I recommend including in your bug report:\n\n\n*\n\n*As precise an estimate as possible of when the freeze last occurred (so developers--and  before that, triagers, if they wish--can easily find the most relevant lines in automatically attached log files).\n\n*Whether or not Alt + SysRq + R E I S U B reboots the computer when the freeze occurs (and if not, what if anything does happen when you use that) -- you can always add that information to the bug report later, so there's no need to wait to report the bug until next time the freeze happens.\n\n\nThat won't be the only information you write in your bug report, of course.\n", "Q: Which application binds a keyboard shortcut I just found a wonderful keyboard shortcut.

My Ubuntu works as host. The sound is stuttering ugly. I tried to change that by changing the Audio-Controller to  ICH AC97 and install the driver downloaded from CHIP. Result: After a restart nothing has changed, Sound stutters like before.\nIs there a way to get a proper sound?\nThe Guest additions are installed and are working fine.\nThis is the Ubuntu HOST:\n\nThese are the settings of the virtualbox-machine:\nWin7, 64bit\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Having experienced the same Windows guest stutter under an Ubuntu host (12.04) - except in Win 8.1 - I found a solution that mostly conforms with Takkat's answer. My stutter occurred with the Windows guest being allocated 4 out of 4 cores, but the execution capped at 75%, with 4GB RAM, and 256 MG graphics RAM. Switching to 2 out of 4 cores - but removing the execution cap - running at 100%, eliminated 90% of the stuttering. But not all of it.\nThe final 10% - and the total elimination of stuttering - came when I switched from the default PulseAudio driver in VirtualBox Manager's settings, to the ALSA Audio Driver. Please note, prior to the aforementioned reallocation of CPU's and execution caps, I had also tried this driver change, and it did not remotely eliminate the stutter. The two changes in combination was required.\n\nA: Stuttering audio almost always indicates an insufficient performance of hardware, or memory. This also depends much on the audio source, and the software used.\nIn case you have no sound issues on your host Ubuntu different Pulse Audio settings will not do much about sound issues arising from running a quite demanding guest OS like Windows 7.\nTo minimize effects coming from limitations of a virtual machine we therefore have to make sure to assign as much hardware ressources to the guest OS as possible, but make sure the host OS is still able to perform well (including Pulse Audio in your case!).\nFrom what we can see from your settings it seems that the requirements to get a smooth audio experience are met. There are few things only we may try to see whether there is an improvement:\n\n\n*\n\n*assign 2 of 3 CPU cores without an execution cap (or 3 of 3 but then with an execution cap)\n\n*give the guest OS more RAM (e.g. 3 GB of 4 GB)\n\n*assign 256 MB of graphics RAM.\n\n\nIn case we then have a better sound output we may reduce the ressources step by step to find the optimum setting for the software we run on our guest.\nIf we still cant get sound output smoothly we may have to try using a software with less demanding sound processing like e.g. WinAmp or Foobar2000 to further track the issue down. \nIt may however be that your hardware capabilities - even though quite good - still are inssufficient for running Windows 7 and your additional software to play sound (and video?) at the same time.\n\nA: in Virtual Machine Settings/Audio\nI changed Host Audio Driver\nfrom ALSA Audio Driver ->\nto PulseAudio\nand sound became fine.\nNo other changes to configuration\n(VirtualBox Guest Additions 4.3.12\n(CentOS 6.5), by the way)\n\nA: This happened to meet too, for some reason the CPUs were on 4 of 8. I use a Macbook Pro running OS X 10 and Windows 7 using VBox. When I put the CPUs down to 1 it started working much better. check it out.\n\nA: I have windows 7 guest, Debian host, and had no sound.  \nMSI board, AMD CPU, Xonar sound card, onboard sound turned off in BIOS\nDebian host showed OXYGEN chipset, which is what Xonar uses.\nNo audio device showed in guest. \nHere is what I did to get sound:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Added the RealTek AC97 audio driver from their website for windows 7 64-bit, paying attention to where it downloaded to. \n\n*Go to device manager > Audio > Driver, manually change the driver, point it to the folder and tell it to include subfolders.  \n\n*should install fine except for the windows warning - ignore it, Realtek is legitimate.  \n\n*Then I had audio from the Xonar, but it still stuttered.  So, went to machine audio settings for the guest, changed it from AC97 to Intel HD Audio.  \n\n\nNOW it works and sounds excellent.  \nNOTE:  Key to this fix is the RealTek driver.  Some people had to switch to Alsa from Pulse Audio.  Mine works fine WITH pulse audio.  This probably has to do with how the HOST machine is set up.  \nI got NO sound unless I used the 537 realtek driver.  others have used the 536 I did not try the 536. \n\nA: I have Linux Mint 17.2 host and Win 7 Guest and also had problems with sound.

I suggest Google, searching for the device ID and 'site:askubuntu.com.' Be aware that the method may vary for earlier Ubuntu versions, 10.04, for example, than from the newer versions, 12.04 or 13.04. You will have better results if you include your Ubuntu version.

As well, if you are not copying to /var/www/wp-admin remember to use the correct path instead.\n\nA: I got into this topic because I ran into the same problem.\nWhen I tried to copy files to the server in the /var/www/html/ Filezilla answered me that permission denied.

So, your browser tries to find www.example.loc the usual way, which is by asking the name server(s) you have configured. But of course no nameserver knows anything about this domain. Your local Apache never gets into action this way ;)\nAs an additional remark, adding names to /etc/hosts this way might bring problems in another regard as well. The line 127.0.0.1 example.loc will probably override the line 127.0.0.1 localhost, so you might get problems resolving localhost. You can assign several names to an ip in one line, so the proper way would be\n127.0.0.1 localhost example.loc www.example.loc\n\n", "Q: Can I install items on Ubuntu, without using the command line?

Some model of drives will spin\ndown, and when the RAID tries to access the disk it will flag it as\nan ATA error if the drives does not respond in time. (This can be a\nfalse negative which there is not much you can do.)\n\n*If there is a bad disk, you may need to test the disk in another\ncomputer with the drive manufacture's tools. This would make sure it\nis not the connection and a deeper test of the drive.\n\n\nIf you had a cable to switch out, it may help rule that issues out.\nInterestingly enough, I have seen this issue on WDC.

Tried to install from iso DVD, but the installation program could not detect any existing operating system.\n\n*Downloaded Parted Magic (per Ubuntu web site recommendation) and booted it to run the following: gdisk /dev/sdb (WD1001FALS), p (indicated everything was OK), x (expert command), n (to generate new protective MBR), w (to save changes).  This procedure had no effect on the Ubuntu 13.04 install process, which could still not detect Windows 7.\n\n*Per another Ubuntu web site recommendation, I created a 200 MB EFI system partition on the second hard drive (WD10EZEX, intended location for all Linux software). After I booted up the Ubuntu 13.04 installation CD and selected Ubuntu installation from the command line menu, the monitor screen went blank - no graphic display, no display of any kind. I turned off the computer manually by holding down the on-off button. The computer could reboot into Windows 7. I tried booting into Parted Magic and again got a blank screen. I used diskpart under the Windows 7 command line to perform a clean command on WD10EZEX and eliminate its EFI partition.  I could again boot into Parted Magic and into the 13.04 installation disk and get displays.\n\n*Per a Rod Smith web article on \"Legacy BIOS Issues with GPT\", I executed the following: gdisk /dev/sdb/, x, h (to recompute CHS values in the protective MBR), w(to save changes and exit).\n\n*I again tried to install Ubuntu 13.04 and got the same message at the Installation type window:\n\nThis computer currently has no detected operating systems.  What would you like to do?\n\nIf I select \"something else\" I get a window showing that sda (WD10EZEX) has no partitions and sdb (WD1001FALS) has an sdb1 efi partition, an sdb2 unknown (I assume this is the MSR partition), and an sdb3 ntfs partition.\nQuestion:\nCan I create /, /swap, and /home partitions onto sda, go ahead with the installation, and be able to boot into either Windows 7 or Ubuntu 13.04?

This program is capable of resize any ext2/3/4 filesystem. Cool! Now how I do it? Simple:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sdf1 8039M\n\n(Remember that the size is the current size + the size you want to add)\nHere you could use M for Megabytes, G for Gigabytes. You should also verify for errors:\nsudo e2fsck -f -p /dev/sdf1\n\nDone.\n\nA: gparted is a graphical application for managing partitions.\nThe error you see above is because gparted is trying to open a graphical console, but since this is Ubuntu server there is no graphical display.\nSome options:\nYou can use command line partitioning tools such as fdisk or sfdisk. These are harder to drive, so read the manual carefully.\nAlternately, if you have another machine running ubuntu desktop, you can use ssh -X from that machine to the server to log in with X11 forwarding. In that shell you can run gparted and it should display on the desktop machine - although you will probably have to tweak the ssh configs a bit and install some X11 programs on the server to get it all working.\n\nA: As David pointed out, gparted is a gui application, so you won't be able to use it on a server without a gui.  You will need to use parted to manipulate partitions on the command line.  It can not directly resize partitions however.  Instead you will have to delete the existing partition and recreate it with the exact same start position, but a longer length, and then run another tool to resize the filesystem inside the partition.\nFirst you need to put it into sector mode with the unit s command and print the existing table.  Use rm 1 to remove the partition, then mkpart to create a new one.  Specify the same starting sector it had before, then specify the end.  You can do that in a form like \"+2500G\" for 2,500 GB from the start rather than having to specify the exact sector.  quit when done, then run sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1.  This is assuming the partition is number 1 on the first disk in the system.\nIf the partition is mounted at the time, then in 12.04 you will get an error trying to change it with parted and will have to reboot for the change to take effect before using resize2fs.\n\nA: Is simple, put this commands in console:\nsudo touch .Xauthority  \nsudo xauth merge ~name_of_user/.Xauthority  \nexport DISPLAY=:0.0  \nsudo gparted\n\n*change name_of_user to your login user\n\nA: I was having same trouble. The error message said I was in trouble because of some 'MIT-Magic-Cookie-1'. None of the above advice helped, but I figured out it was all about root, server and desktop complications, because I had an upgrade from zesty to artful before. Some packages were removed of course.\nHere is what solved my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create user root.  \n\n*Login as user root, ...this worked out for me pressing the keyboard combination Ctrl+Alt+F2  \n\n*From the terminal simply: startx  \n\n*Super key and look for GParted.  \n\n\nI believe this is an ideal solution to switch between the X-server and wayland/mir. If you want to return back to your previous account, logout from X Window and terminal, press Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\nA: Running GParted as a normal user instead of root would prevent the following:\nUnit tmp.mount does not exist, proceeding anyway.\n(gpartedbin:3232): Gtk-WARNING **: 21:46:48.189: cannot open display:\n\n", "Q: Why cant I create a directory in /sys I'm learning Ubuntu and experimenting with things.\nI noticed I couldnt create a directory within /sys\nIs this a special directory or something? Are there other types of directories?\n(I did a sudo -i and a chmod a+w /sys)\n\nA: Yes, /sys is a \"special\" directory. From Wikipedia:\n\nModern Linux distributions include a /sys directory as a virtual\n  filesystem (sysfs, comparable to /proc, which is a procfs), which\n  stores and allows modification of the devices connected to the system,\n  whereas many traditional UNIX and Unix-like operating systems use /sys\n  as a symbolic link to the kernel source tree.\n\nThe \"Stores and allows modification of the devices connected to the system\" is pretty important. The fact that /sys is used as a virtual filesystem, mounted specially, is why you (and root) can't write to it. I would avoid messing with /sys. With Linux, which is very open and transparent, things are usually not changeable for a good reason; either for security purposes, or, in this case, because there is another way to achieve your goal that is a lot less risky.\n\nA: First, you should change /sys's permissions back (sudo chmod a-r /sys will do it, since the default permissions are dr-xr-xr-x). /sys should not be world-writeable!\nIn general, to create files and directories in parts of the system outside your home folder, external media, and the /tmp folder, you should do it as root with sudo, rather than by changing permissions or ownership to give yourself access. Making directories world-writeable is particularly not recommended.\nFor information on the recommended way, see:\n\n*\n\n*RootSudo (in the Ubuntu documentation wiki)\n\n*How can I rename items in places I don't own, like / , and why shouldn't I?\n(about renaming, but related, and details some of the important concepts)\n\nYou can even use gksudo nautilus (or sudo -H nautilus if you don't have gksudo) to open a root-owned file browser window. Be careful with this, though--it can do just about anything, and most of those things are things you probably don't want done. Also, note that if you launch a program from a root-owned file browser window, that program will run as root too.\nThat's generally what you should do, to edit or create new contents of directories owned by root. However...\n/sys is different; even root can't directly create stuff there\nLike /proc and /dev, in Ubuntu and other OSes using the Linux kernel, /sys is a virtual filesystem, what it represents is not real files on your disk (or anywhere).\nIn short, /sys is a way the kernel provides information about (physical and virtual) devices.\nSome entries in the /sys filesystem are also meaningfully writable and writing to them is a way to dynamically set configuration for devices. (This should not be confused with the /dev filesystem; writing to entries in /dev is a way of sending data to devices.)\nBut this still must be done as root. Rather than changing permission on /sys or any part of it, you should just perform those action as root with sudo as explained above.\nThis answer on Unix.SE explains how to do that, and even how to allow some non-administrators (who cannot perform most actions as root) to change some /sys settings.\nFor more information about how /sys works, see:\n\n*\n\n*sysfs (Wikipedia)\n\n*kernel.org docs on sys (as linked to from here)\n\nEntries in /sys are created by the kernel and by drivers; you cannot just create them from the command-line. (As stated above, you can edit some as root, but you cannot generally make new ones from userspace except by loading kernel modules or otherwise installing drivers or modifying the kernel.)\nIf you happen to be interested in writing drivers, see:\n\n*\n\n*man 2 sysfs\n\n*How to Create a `sysfs File Correctly\n", "Q: How to configure a second monitor using DisplayLink on Ubuntu 13.04 After following the advice in this question, the second monitor is detected, and the mirroring option works (although not that smoothly). However, I'm not able to activate the second monitor in the display settings.\nI got an error that says Failed to apply configuration: %s. I have no idea how to debug this. Any points or work around to fix this?\n\n\nA: I was able to resolve this issue by switching the display off and back on using xrandr like so:\n$ xrandr --output DVI-0 --off\n$ xrandr --output DVI-0 --auto\n\nI went through this just recently and summed it up on my blog.

Everything seemed fine until it tried to start up after the Installation was done and the dvd was ejected. It showed a Lubuntu screen , bu then just a small blinking white line, like an underscore, and blank screen. This just repeats over and over . Can anyone help? Btw, I don't know much about computers so basic is better.\n\nA: Are you sure you were not trying to boot from the cd/dvd again with no disk. You should change the boot order by going back into bios which stays the same when you first boot the computer up. It can be f2 of other f keys on your computer but varies by manufacturer. \nIf you get into bios try and select the hard disk you installed it on and boot from that should probably be labeled as a hard drive.\nIf you cannot find an external usb drive in bios then try this even though it is unlikely to be the way you were trying to install.\nOne other possibility is if you installed it onto an external hard drive connected through usb your computer might not be able to boot from that natively. http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagers.html Plop fits on a cd so you will want your bios set to boot to plop in the cd drive then it will come to a menu and select usb if that is what you are trying to boot from.\n", "Q: Transmission stopped working I was impatient with a torrent download and then I opened Transmission's Preferences and went changing everything I could to as close as possible to infinite, closed and OK.\nAfter seeing that the speed was still the same I went over the Preferences dialog again and set the values of “Queue” section under “Downloading” tab to “999999999999”, although it doesn't allow such values and reset to the maximum permitted. Obviously that changing that wouldn't increase the speed, although I was veeery impatient, and after changing “Downloads sharing data in the last N minutes are active”, which also didn't accepted the astronomic number and reset my entry to “28410”, Transmission froze, I tried to force it to close and open it again but it lags to start and when it do start, already starts frozen.\nNow not even removing or purging or manually deleting it's files and then installing again transmission-gtk and transmission-common will do the job.\nI suspect that some configuration file is being kept after purging transmission, because when I install it again, all my torrents are still there (and I only use magnet links) and they show the correct progress bars. After starting Transmission it will work for 3 seconds and freeze after that, in these 3 seconds I managed to open Preferences dialog and I saw that the value of “Downloads sharing data in the last N minutes are active” is still “28410”.\nIf at least I knew where the file that stores these values is, I could manually reset them all. And when I start a Guest session and open Transmission it will work normally, reinforcing that the problem is in the value of “Downloads sharing data in the last N minutes are active” that I changed up to the maximum.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: You can try to edit the following file \"settings.json\".\nNOTE: Make sure that transmission is not running. you can kill it with: pkill transmission\n1) Open a terminal and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit ~/.config/transmission/settings.json\n2) Searh for the lines 19 and 47 (\"download-queue-size\" &  \"queue-stalled-minutes\") and edit them.\n\n\nBy default the \"download-queue-size\" key is set to 5 and the\n  \"queue-stalled-minutes\" is set to 30.\n\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Problem in jenkins installation on Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS $ sudo apt-get install jenkins\n    Reading package lists...

If so, they are probably moved to the Rubbish Bin rather than deleted.\nOpen Files, right click on the Rubbish Bin and choose Empty Rubbish Bin.\n\nA: On removable media, Ubuntu creates a folder called .trashes which works like the trash bin does on the rest of the computer.

It worked at first, and then I got some error messages involving libgpod-common, and now the iPod doesn't even mount.  It doesn't show up in my file system, but I can see it in the disk utility, mounted at /tmp/ipodiA0gIP. When I try to safely remove it from the disk utility, it says that it's busy and can't be removed, but it works if I unmount it and then remove it from the disk utility.  How can I get it to pop up in Rhythmbox?\n\nA: I figured it out eventually. I got it to pop up in Rhythmbox by unmounting and remounting from the disk utility, but when I clicked on it Rhythmbox crashed. I tried to copy all the data from it before messing around any more, and found out that my album art files were damaged. I tried to delete them, but it was mounted read only.

I have tried the Help button from the Main Menu, but I only got a message \n\nDocument Not Found\nThe URI ‘ghelp:user-guide?menu-editor#menu-editor' does not point\nto a valid page.\n.

Only now I have realized that the Main Menu dialog with the \"Command\" text box has a title 'Launcher Properties'.\nAfter the change in the Main Menu \"Command\" text box for gedit according to the mentioned answer, it is sufficient to click the gedit icon yet locked in the Launcher or click the name of the *.txt file in Krusader for gedit to open files with my desired coding Windows-1250.

Why is this?\n\nA: Piggyback on Eliah's solution along with the bug reports on ubuntu (1310058), I was able to workaround the issue where encrypted swap gets lost when rebooting ubuntu 14.04.\nCredit help goes to\nhttp://punygeek.blogspot.com/2012/10/ubuntu-1204-how-to-solve-disk-drive-for.html\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecryptfs-utils/+bug/1310058 (comments #3, #17, and #22)\nsudo swapoff -a\n\ncomment out swap config in /etc/crypttab\n#cryptswap1 UUID={your uuid} /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\ncomment out swap config in /etc/fstab\n#/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nReboot your computer, so you can reformat the swap partition using gparted afterwards.

Your installed system might or might not have the same problem once created--if it does, the problem can be addressed in the installed system.\nIf this is happening on a system that is installed on your hard disk, then your system might still run okay, but it's a good idea to fix it--if you have a swap partition (or swap file), you may as well use it.\nMost Ubuntu systems with swap have a swap partition. Assuming that is the case, the technique described in this blog post may help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 - How to solve \"The disk drive for /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present\" error at boot\nHere's a summary, with some additional information that may be helpful for novices, and in my own words. I suggest taking a look at that post as well though (assuming it remains accessible), as it contains some examples and other information that I've left out for brevity.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) or a virtual console and run: sudo swapoff -a\n\n*Open /etc/crypttab (e.g., sudo nano -w /etc/crypttab or sudo -H gedit /etc/cryptab for a GUI editor) and put a # at the beginning of the line that starts with cryptswap1. Save the file.\n\n*Do the same thing with the line that starts with /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 in /etc/fstab.\n\n*Install gparted . Run it and format your swap partition as linux-swap. Make sure to get the right partition; if you get the wrong one, you'll lose possibly important data! The line you commented out in crypttab should give the correct partition name (it comes right after /dev/).\n\n*Run sudo mkswap /dev/..., repacing ... with that same device name. Part of that command's output should be text that says UUID=..... where ..... is a string of letters and numbers.\n\n*In the file /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume, find the line that says RESUME=UUID= followed by letters and numbers like (but not identical to) ..... from the last step. Replace them with ..... (i.e., with the letters and numbers mkswap gave after UUID=.\n\n*Run sudo swapon /dev/... (with the same /dev/... as you had in steps 4 and 5 above).\n\n*Run sudo ecryptfs-setup-swap.\n\n\nswapon -s will check to see if swap is successfully enabled. See that blog post for more information, and example output, for checking this.\nSource: http://punygeek.blogspot.com/2012/10/ubuntu-1204-how-to-solve-disk-drive-for.html (on http://punygeek.blogspot.com/) by Litmus / Puny Geek. Some commands are copied; prose is not copied, but often expresses the same ideas.\nFinally, note that this might be a bug. (I believe multiple factors could cause this problem, only some of which are bugs.) In particular, it resembles Launchpad Bug #1153661. If you believe that's your situation, you might want to subscribe to that, mark yourself affected (with the green \"This bug affects...\" link at the top of the page), and if you have any additional information to provide, comment with it.\n", "Q: Running a program as another user without typing a password I'm trying to mark my browser internet traffic with a DSCP by selecting the packages with a certain owner. In order to do that I have to start my browser with a dummy user. \nI start my browser by binding a terminal command to a keyboard shortcut. So for now that has always been  chromium-browser. \nThe steps I have taken so far:\nCreate a new user: \n sudo useradd <dummy user>\n sudo passwd <dummy user>\n sudo mkdir /home/<dummy user>\n sudo chown <dummy user> /home/<dummy user>\n sudo chgrp <dummy user> /home/<dummy user>\n\nAllow the new user to acces X\nxhost +\nRun the command as the new user\nI start a terminal as the original user (non-root) and run the following command:\nsu <dummy user> -c chromium-browser\n\nafter typing the dummy user password I can run the chromium-browser as the dummy user. Chromium will be all new and won't have any of my old settings since it uses the newly created dummy user home dir.\nNow I don't want to have to enter a password at any stage so I looked into how to work with the sudoers file. \nApperently it is possible to run a command as another user without being prompt for the password by changing the sudoers file. I have not yet figured out exactly how but I think it relies on sudo -u. Which also allows you to run a command as someone else. Before I started to adapt the sudoers file I wanted to test this structure. So I ran:\nsudo -u <dummy user> chromium-browser\n\nAnd I got the following error:\n[0906/012127:ERROR:nss_util.cc(90)] Failed to create /home/<user>/.pki/nssdb directory.\n[0906/012127:ERROR:nss_util.cc(90)] Failed to create /home/<user>/.pki/nssdb directory.\nHome directory /home/<user> not ours.\n\nwhere <user> is my username. So it tries to acces my home users home dir. \nI'm hoping someone can help me figure this out. I have the feeling I'm sort of in the right direction but I need someone let me see what I'm doing wrong. Also any help on how to change the sudoers file would be appreciated.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: According to sudo manual:\n    By default, sudo does not modify HOME\n\nIt means that when your run sudo -u <dummy user> <command>, HOME is unchanged and point to the invoking user home directory. More precisely, the entire environment remains unchanged, and the command is executed, therefore, in the environment of the user who invoked sudo. Only uid is changed and when command try to write in $HOME it has not right permission.\nIn order to run command as <dummy user> without being prompt for the password and have the right environment, you should create a simple file:\n    sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/myOverrides \n\nwith this directive:\n    <user> ALL= NOPASSWD:/bin/su\n\nThat allow <user> to run su command as root without being prompt for password (<user> password) and running su as root doesn't require to enter the target user's password (<dummy user> in this case).\n   sudo su - <dummy user> -c /path/to/chromium-browser\n\nAnother better approach, change /etc/sudoers.d/myOverrides with:\n   <user> ALL= (<dummy user>) NOPASSWD:/path/to/chromium-browser\n\nthis allow <user> to run /path/to/chromium-browser as <dummy user> without being prompt for password.\n   sudo -u <dummy user> -i /path/to/chromium-browser\n\nwhere -i option, according to sudo manual:\n\nThe -i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell specified in the\n  passwd(5) entry of the target user as a login shell.  This means that\n  login-specific resource files such as .profile or .login will be read\n  by the shell.  If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell\n  for execution.  Otherwise, an interactive shell is executed. sudo\n  attempts to change to that user’s home directory before running the\n  shell.  It also initializes the environment, leaving DISPLAY and TERM\n  unchanged, setting HOME, SHELL, USER, LOGNAME, and PATH, as well as\n  the contents of /etc/environment on Linux and AIX systems.  All other\n  environment variables are removed.\n\n", "Q: Easy way to create movie DVDs? DVDStyler QDVDAuthor DeVeDe No Go I've been trying to create a movie DVD with some authoring tools after having split out my vid/aud/sub through avconv.\n\n\n*\n\n*After reading through the many man pages and website tips, editing xml files for DVDAuthor looks to be too much a pain.\n\n*QDVDAuthor seems to have collected development/support dust and require libavcodec-extras-52 which I can't get installed. \n\n*DVD Styler seems to go nowhere with an enigmatic Error Menu Creation before rudely crashing. Anyone have a better suggestion?\n\n*DeVeDe complains it seems a bug in mencoder at any attempt to create something.\n\n\nA: Here are a couple other alternatives you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bombono DVD - It seems that some users report that it cannot be run from the Unity dash, however the terminal command bombono-dvd will open it once installed.\n\n*KDE's KMediaFactory - This installs and runs fine for me, and like all other KDE software, it seems to be quite complete in design and runs fine. You will have to install all the KDE base libraries, but if you're not concerned about disk space that will not be a problem.\n\n*Mistelix - This seems to be more targeted towards users desiring to create homemade slideshow-type projects, but it may achieve your goal anyway.\n\n*Tovid GUI - It has been described as \"archaic\". However, upon installation it seems that this is probably the most complete and feature-rich software available for the intended purpose. You will be presented with a plentiful array of options. However, this is also meant to be run from the terminal, with the command tovid gui.\n\n\nA: (I had the same problem, and I must admit that full of bugs is a qualificative that applies to most of DVD software, so I can understand that DeVeDe and DVDAuthor are still a no go)\nTo complete the already existing answer, now with ubuntu 13.10 and later, DVDStyler runs fine and perfectly answers our problem. However I must point out that some of the other softwares are dead projects.\n\n\n*\n\n*DVDStyler still in active development (SourceForge),\n\n*DeVeDe remained unchanged/unmaintened since 2012 (GitHub),\n\n*DVDAuthor died in 2012 too.

Imported videos can be loaded into a timeline and previewed frame by frame. What's more, the software allows you to split each video into multiple chapters. All you have to do is create one or more key points on a video's timeline, which can be done with a single click. A chapter's length can be modified just by clicking and dragging the created key points.\nThe main features of Bombono DVD are:\n\n*\n\n*excellent MPEG viewer: Timeline and Monitor\n\n*real WYSIWYG Menu Editor with live thumbnails\n\n*comfortable drag-and-drop support\n\n*You can author to folder, make ISO-image or burn directly to DVD.\n\n*reauthoring: You can import video from DVD disks.\n\nBombono DVD works great in 18.04, but not in 19.04. To install it open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install bombono-dvd bombono-dvd-data \n\n\nOpen DVD Producer\nOpen DVD Producer (opendvdproducer) is a modern, open source cross platform software to produce DVD images, and create DVDs with menus and chapters in a simple yet professional way. The main functions of the DVD specification are implemented in the software. For example, you can create a DVD in any supported format, with various menus, with directional buttons, videos with chapters and set sections of videos to play.\nThe main features of Open DVD Producer are:\n\n*\n\n*Menus - You can create static menus with any sound you want. Or you can use some special video as animated menu.\n\n*Buttons - \"Point and click\" the buttons you want to create, and you have a real time preview of them. Also, you can set the directions the remote control will take.\n\n*Built-in encoder - There is no need to use some external conversor. Open DVD Producer is able to convert from any kind of known video format.\n\n*Chapters - Want to play at some point in the video? No problem, you can set chapter marks directly on the timeline, and also set segmented pieces of video.\n\n*MD5 checksum - Generate MD5 after the ISO is ready for integrity check.\n\n*DDP® for replication - The DDP® can be generated for large production (specification version 2.00).\n\n*Advanced settings for menus - You can set the background image or video. The color and opacity of buttons highlight. Set the buttons directions directly on the screen.\n\n*Advanced settings for videos - It is possible to set the video resolution. Also you can set chapter marks in a visual way, with frame-by-frame accuracy.\n\nTo install Open DVD Producer in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo snap install opendvdproducer --channel=edge\n\n\nDVDStyler\nDVDStyler is a cross-platform free DVD authoring application that makes possible for video enthusiasts to create professional-looking DVDs. DVDStyler provides over 20 DVD menu templates, allowing you to create your own menu designs and photo slideshows. After you select your DVD label name, video quality, video format, aspect ratio, and audio format, you can select a template to add video materials to. DVDStyler's interface supports drag-and-drop so you can add project buttons and movies around with ease. Some basic video editing operations such as trimming and cropping are also available.\nThe main features of DVDStyler are:\n\n*\n\n*create and burn DVD video with interactive menus\n\n*support of AVI, MOV, MP4, MPEG, OGG, WMV and other file formats\n\n*support of MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, Xvid, MP2, MP3, AC-3 and other audio and video formats\n\n*user-friendly interface with support of drag-and-drop\n\n*flexible menu creation on the basis of scalable vector graphics\nfile\n\nTo install DVDStyler dwonload the DVDStyler .tar.bz2 file and follow the instructions in How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?.\n", "Q: What DVD players allow easy selection of chapters/titles during playback? I need a DVD player that shows this:\n\nThat is Windows Media Player 12, it shows chapter and title that its playing.\nThanks in advance and please don't tell me VLC, because it doesn't have that feature.\n\nA: VLC\nVLC  does let you select a different title and/or chapter while a video plays. I don't believe it can show a sidebar like Windows Media Player for this, but the exact same functionality is accessible through the Playback menu.\nSee below for alternatives, in case you don't want to use VLC.\nThe Title, Chapter, and Navigation submenus of the Playback menu in VLC let you select a different chapter, title, or both while playing a video.\n(It only lists titles and chapters that are provided by the currently loaded video file or the current disc. But you can use View > Playlist to create lists of different media items and select between them.)\nHere's a screenshot of a Playback > Title menu selection in VLC (larger size):\n\nThat screenshot is from a Lubuntu system, running the LXDE desktop environment. But you do in the same way in any other desktop environment, including GNOME/Unity. The difference is that, in Unity, an application's menu bar will typically be at the top of the screen rather than in the application window under the title bar.\nAlternatively, you can right-click anywhere in the video itself, and access the menus, including the Playback menu and its submenus. This works even when VLC is in full screen mode.\nHere's a screenshot of a Playback > Navigation menu selection in fullscreened VLC (larger size):\n\nDifferent DVD's organize their menu hierarchy differently. The DVD shown above is divided into many titles, each with just one chapter. It's more common--especially for a DVD of a single artistic work like a feature film--to have a smaller number of titles (sometimes just one) divided into several separate chapters.\nHowever your DVD is divided, the Title, Chapter, and Navigation menus in VLC let you switch from any title and chapter to any other. (They also usually let you select any of the top-level menus. For example, to jump back to the DVD Menu, use Title > DVD Menu.)\nSMPlayer\nSMPlayer  is one of a few players available for Ubuntu, besides VLC, that let's you switch to any title/chapter while playing a DVD.\nSMPlayer is a bit rough around the edges. I'd suggest VLC over it, for playing DVDs. SMPlayer may ask you want version of mplayer you have installed. Assuming mplayer  is installed, the answer is usually the latest version that SMPlayer knows about, at least these days.\nSMPlayer might also ask you to configure the DVD drive, the first time it runs, as it does not yet always have the ability to figure out what drive(s) to play DVDs from. If your Ubuntu machine has only one optical drive, then your DVD drive is usually /dev/sr0 (though /dev/dvd may also work).\nAnd SMPlayer's support for displaying DVD menus is experimental. In my limited experience, it seems to usually work okay. Please note that this has little to no bearing on its ability to switch between titles and chapters via its own interface.\nSMPlayer's Browse menu lets you navigate through the structure of the currently playing DVD, through its Title, Chapter, and Angle submenus. It also has menu items to switch quickly to interactive DVD menus (if you've enabled them in SMPlayer).\n\nThe Title and Chapter submenus of Browse in SMPlayer work mostly the same as the Title and Chapter submenus of Playback in VLC.\nLike in VLC (as descrbed above), the menu bar in SMPlayer will typically appear at the top of the screen if you're in a Unity desktop; only a few applications override this and keep their menu bars inside the application window.\nAlso like in VLC, the SMPlayer Browse menu and its submenus are accessible while in full screen mode, by right-clicking:\n\nKaffeine\nEspecially if you use a KDE desktop (Kubuntu), you might wish to use Kaffeine .\nIt will work without KDE as well, and installing it doesn't tend to pull in too many additional dependencies. (This is nice, as many KDE applications require large parts of KDE to be installed; Kaffeine does not.)\nKaffeine supports DVD playback, and has had full menu support for some time. It also supports navigation to any title, chapter, and angle of a DVD from the Title, Chapter, and Angle submenus of its Playback menu, or directly from the contextual menu that comes up when you right-click inside the video.\n\n\nTo illustrate the techniques described, this answer contains a small number of partial still images from Reformation 1 (2009), Sin by Silence (2009), and Pushing Hands (1992).

Instead, it is a reminder that you must run commands like apt-get and aptitude as root, for package installation to succeed.\nIf you're not running it as root or are not sure if you are--in particular, if you are not using sudo--then you should run it as root with sudo. See this question for more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Permission denied, are you root?\nIf you are using sudo but still get that error, that's strange. There are some similar errors can occur when permission to access a lock file is denied due to another concurrently running package management utility or stale locks (that continue existing after the utility they represent is no longer running). So some of the answers here may help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/) is another process using it?\nIf none of this helps, then you'll have to provide more information. In particular, to get better answers, you should add the complete and exact text from the Terminal, including the lines showing commands you are running (and especially the command or commands that result in the \"are you root\" message), to your question, by editing your question.\n", "Q: Steam not booting up?

Your only alternative is to flash a custom firmware with a tool called nvflash (not available on canonical servers).\nEven though a linux version of nvflash is available it is suggested to boot from a DOS box and use the dos version of the same tool. You can find a very exhaustive guide here BUT flashing a custom firmware is a very dangerous business (you may end up with a bricked video card) and I would discourage you from taking that route.\n", "Q: Mounting External HD inside Encrypted Folder I have an external HD (USB 3.0, 1TB) that contains all of my music files.  For the past 6 months, I've had my Linux box (Xubuntu 13.04, Kernel 3.8) rigged to automatically mount this drive on login to the ~/Music folder.\nThe other day, I decided to encrypt my home folder.  Unfortunately, the HD no longer mounts properly in the Music folder.  It still mounts fine if I manually mount it to /media/Music or any other place outside of my home folder, but even though it claims to have mounted to ~/Music, none of my files or folders show up inside the Music folder.\nIs this not doable inside an encrypted folder, even after it has been unlocked?  Or are there some extra steps I am missing?\nThanks!\nEdit:  df lists the drive (/dev/sdc2) as mounted to /home//Music, but the folder is still empty.\n\nA: Best solution to use encrypted file systems with the other ones is symbolic link. Mount HD to /media/Music and use symbolic link at home folder:\nln -s /media/Music /home/USERNAME/Music\n", "Q: How to permanently configure keyboard I use a Turkish keyboard which I have converted to English (Ubuntu server 12.04). My problem is that the single quote is not present on the keyboard but is instead represent by a comma in midair. To fix this I use the command \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nThe problem is each time I shutdown, changes are reverted thus every time I start the system, I have to type that command.

Has anyone stumbled across a thing like this? I'm using 12.04 and 13.04 on my computers.\n\nA: It think it would be possible...\nOn Ubuntu you can middle click an indicator icon.  Your indicator could capture that event and then fire up your browser and open the bookmark (URL) for that icon.  In my indicator-fortune I respond to middle mouse clicks show a notification - but you'd do the browser thing.\nI'm suggesting the middle mouse button since you said you don't want a menu as such.\nAlso, your indicator would have to manage bookmarks, so you'd still need a menu to show a bookmark manager - just a list of bookmarks.  Or perhaps the indicator simply parses a known .html/.xml file - up to you.\nIf you wanted to have an icon per bookmark (not very scaleable) then your indicator proper would have to loop over your bookmarks and fire up a separate indicator for each.\nI'd suggest a single icon and then list the bookmarks in the menu...you can then also have sub-menus to categorise your bookmarks.\n", "Q: How to compile a xul extension in Ubuntu 13.04 ?

I'm already logged in to an Ubuntu One account. I'm trying to install software from the Ubuntu software center.  It's asking me for my Ubuntu One login, and then rejecting it. (It does work to log me in to Ubuntu One on this computer, an Android phone, and a Windows 7 computer.) I've tried resetting my password via a \"reset password\" email link: I get a message that I'm unauthenticated. I've tried cutting and pasting the login code sent via email: the code is not recognized. I've tried creating a new account -- something I don't really want to do -- it tells me an account already exists for my email address.  Help?\n\nA: I just had this problem when trying to install the \"snap\" version of vlc. \nI have several machines running 16.04 \"Xenial\" and on the ones I have tried, when I try to install the snap version of vlc (labeled \"nonfree\") in the Ubuntu Software utility, the utility puts up a dialog asking for my Ubuntu One email address and password. I have tried numerous times, but the dialog will not accept any of the registered combinations. I used the button on the dialog to reset my password, and the software still does not accept the new password. I confirmed that I am still able to log into the Ubuntu One SSO sites using the new password.\nHere's a workaround -- open up a terminal and you can install a snap package using the command line utilities -- no Ubuntu One password requested.\n\n$ snap find vlc\nName  Version  Developer  Notes  Summary\nvlc   daily    videolan   -      The ultimate media player\n\n$ snap list\nNo snaps are installed yet.

This is not necessarily what's happening, but I think it's worth checking to make sure.\nInstalling software in the Software Center does not ordinarily require your Ubuntu One password. Instead, it usually requires your local user account password. Assuming you haven't changed your user account password (changing the Ubuntu One password doesn't change it), this is the password you set up when you installed Ubuntu originally.\nFurthermore, even if you have to enter your Ubuntu One password (for example, to access a software source for software you paid for or wish to pay for), you might still also have to enter your local user account password. It might be prompting your with multiple password prompts. A bug could perhaps even cause them to appear in the wrong order.\nIf you don't remember your password or it isn't working (and you're typing it in correctly, Caps Lock is not on, and you're not accidentally using the wrong keyboard layout), then you can reset it:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I reset a lost administrative password?\nNote that this is totally different from resetting your Ubuntu One password. This doesn't even involve accessing the Internet (except in the sense that those instructions are on the Internet).\nIf that doesn't help, please edit your question with more details, including what software you're attempting to install, exactly what you're doing in the Software Center, and exactly what happens, including the complete and exact text of the error message that told you your login was not accepted.\nIf you're installing paid software and you have to enter a special password to access the online software source, please edit your question to indicate that, and to provide as many details as possible.\nIf using your Ubuntu account password as described above does enable you to install software in the Software Center, then I recommend posting a separate question about the Ubuntu One problem (as then it is definitely a separate issue).\n\nA: It is clear he is trying to install \"nonfree\" software, which is not necessarily paid (e.g. fragment was $0.00 during its time in the store, seems to be gone in 16.04).  \nI am currently having similar trouble with the new snap for Krita, requires Ubuntu One login through the software center that fails, but it works on the Ubuntu One site.  This does not something that the OP can do something about on his own.  \nMy suggested course of action is to file a bug report.  Here is a good place: \nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs. I am aware the question is old and the problem is not new, but it does not seem to have been solved.  \n", "Q: Fn + F2 what does it do? When I prees Fn+F2 my screen turn black what does it do? I want to know what change does it make.\nWhen at window7 I press Fn+F2 it will turn on wifi.\nAfter I restart nothing happen , did it will make eror?\nsorry about my bad english\n\nA: After pressing Fn+F2, try and see if Fn+F7 or Alt+F7 bring you back to the GUI. It sounds from your description that Fn may be behaving like Ctrl+Alt. If that's the case, then it's switching virtual consoles. The seventh virtual console is typically your GUI; lower-numbered ones behave as text terminals.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*virtual console (wikipedia)\n\n*What is a virtual terminal for?\n\n*What does \"Ctrl + Alt + F12\" do?\nHowever, if the screen turns completely black, then that's probably not what's going on. In that case, it probably dims or turns off the screen.\nSo another combination should brighten or turn on the screen. Assuming you've tried pressing Fn+F2 again to see if it toggles things back to the way they were before, you might try Fn+F1 or Fn+F3 to see if you can reverse the effect of Fn+F2.\nIf this was a one-time occurrence and the question is whether or not it represents a problem you have to worry about, the answer is probably not. In that case, I'm not sure of the cause, but it could be:\n\n\n*\n\n*There was a bug, and an update fixed it (perhaps an update installed before the first time you pressed Fn+F2, but which did not take effect until the next boot-up).\n\n*Some other key was accidentally pressed at the same time.\n\n*Some program interpreted that key as input, and triggered a problem.\n\n\nAll of these explanations suggest a bug, but there are probably other explanations. If the problem happens again, then I recommend editing your question to provide more information (or posting a new one if the situation has changed considerably). In that case, the main question will be whether or not it's a bug and, if so, what package to report the bug as affecting.\n", "Q: step by step Ubuntu 12.04 install of Realtek RTL8188CE driver I am completely new and have never even used terminal before, let alone try install a driver, so while I’ve read countless answers in response to the above problem, I don't even understand when I should press 'enter' in terminal. \nMy situation is I bought a new Toshiba Satellite C850- F0155 with no OS.

But this workaround is obviously not preferred.\nI should probably mention I turned off dnsmasq because with it, the VPN's DNS resolution does not work at all, despite all the files containing what they should have.\nWhat is the proper way to fix this?\n\nA: What should happen is that the VPN client proces should register the VPN nameserver address with resolvconf under the record name IFACE.CLIENT where IFACE is the name of the VPN network interface (e.g., tun0) and CLIENT is the name of the VPN client program; and the file /etc/resolvconf/interface-order should include a glob pattern matching this record name at an appropriately high priority: after loopback interfaces lo* but before the LAN interfaces such as eth*. In the factory-shipped interface-order file the tun* and tap* patterns are at the right position in the order. \nIf you are using a third party VPN client program then it may not support this, in which case you will have either to hack the latter program's scripts or adopt some workaround such as putting an address on a dns-nameservers line in /etc/network/interfaces (if ifup is used) or writing a custom resolvconf update script.\n", "Q: How to crash Bacula network backup system How do I crash a bacula network backup system .I was given a project to build a bacula network backup system and crash it ,then recover.I was able to build it but now im on crashing stage.Please help\n\nA: It sounds like you've been asked to test a backup system to make sure it does what it's intended to: Keep data safe. There are a few tests you can do to simulate this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assume one of your workstations was hit by a meteor and create a new one based off the backups.\nThe process involves taking a computer, creating some documents, backing up and then reformatting and trying to recover.

This usually requires a RAID6 solution.\nThe quick way to test this is to just pull a disk from the array. If the whole system dies or at least ceases to be useful, you have a problem.\n\n*What happens if the Bacula server is hit by a meteor? Daily off-site copies of the last backup are essential but they need to be secure too.

In the installation of wubi, or Ubuntu 12.04.3  it asks for a password, but won't accept any I choose. It says they don't match. Match with what?  I don't use a password on my laptop so how can I match a password I haven't got?\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu (no matter how you install it), you enter a password for the first user account, created during installation.\nYou are asked to enter the password twice. You have to put in exactly the same password both times. Otherwise, you would think Ubuntu was using the password you had in mind, but it would be using some mistype of it!\nSo, your password has to match what you typed the first time you entered it.\n", "Q: How to read AT commands that Ubuntu sends to my 3G modem? The modem, Huawei E173 (12d1:1436) works out of the box with Ubuntu. I can connect to the Internet with no difficulties. I would like to know how Ubuntu does this. When connected, the modem is initialized with AT commands. Does network-manager or modem-manager keep these commands somewhere in a file?

If the makefile was created sanely then it's likely one of those two commands might actually remove the software compiled by the source through make and make install.\n\nA: I have learned from ubuntuforums that there is no way to use apt-get remove samba4, or apt-get --purge remove samba4*to uninstall Samba 4.2.0pre installed from git, because it has not been installed from reposistory. \nThe only way to uninstall Samba 4.2.0pre installed from git is to do rm -rf on the samba folder and to edit all files you edited that referes to Samba 4.2.0pre in the beginning.\n", "Q: Window placement on two monitors in 12.04 I have two monitors and recently moved from 10.04 to 12.04. In 10.04, any new window was placed on the monitor that my mouse pointer was located, so if I wanted to have a terminal open on the left side, I moved my mouse pointer to the monitor on the left and opened a terminal.\nIn 12.04, this is no longer the case, at least not always. It annoys the hell out of me, as I have very precise ideas where the windows should go, and I have several applications that by default start maximized and w/o window decorations, so moving them from one monitor to another is sometimes tricky.\nFor example, I did not manage to start a virtual box window in full screen mode on the right monitor; whatever I do, it always maximizes on the left one. Is there a trick or a setting in CCSM to change this behavior?\n\nA: I found it. Install compiz config settings manager (package compizconfig-settings-manager) and go to the plugin \"Place Windows\".

I'm not using Unity, and very much want generic click-and-drag via three finger touch.\n\nA: Ubuntu does different: Double tap, but dont release. Is the new three finger drag. Also, it works the same on Windows (not that it matters), and works quite ok for me, for now.\nJust had to find out, that was the hardest part.\n\nA: Since you don't have unity you should be able to just install touchegg from the Ubuntu Software Center and then for a nice gui you can download and install the touchegg gui from here: https://github.com/Raffarti/Touchegg-gce\nTouchegg is awesome by the way! I programmed 3,4 and 5 finger gestures to do anything i wanted. You can program clicks as well as different swipes as well. it's pretty awesome.\n\nA: You can build https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/building.html Ubuntu and has some cool features. It also has 3 finger gesture. You can configure it to do drag. Here https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/gestures.html. I am using it for Gnome Xorg in Ubuntu 20.04..

Background:\nI'm using a Ubuntu 12.10 Live CD (USB) in order to resize some partitions on my laptop.\nMy laptop is connected to an additional monitor which I have set as a separate screen.\nI started the partition process and went to get a snack while I waited for the tasks to finish.\nThe problem:\nWhen I came back from getting my snack I found that my computer's monitor had been disabled. I shook the mouse expecting it to wake up, however, only my external monitor came to life.\nGParted was hidden behind the disabled monitor, and when I attempted to open the displays tab, it too opened inside of the disabled screen.\nI opened the console by pressing alt + f6 and attempted to use xrandr commands only to be met with error messages reading \"Can't open display\".\nI did not want to restart as my partition task was still running in the background and disabling it could potentially endanger the data I was transferring.\n\nA: The Solution:\nBy chance I found a solution to my problem. I was trying to move the windows from one monitor to the next by blindly fishing for them in the\nother window and dragging them back while holding alt. In order to get an idea of the window's position I opened the Workspace Switcher.\nOne of the times that I opened the Workspace Switcher I inadvertently found that you can click and drag to reorganize windows while still inside the workspace overview screen.\nThis handy little feature that I didn't know about helped me immensely tonight.\nI'm posting the solution to my own problem in case someone else happens to follow in my footsteps.\nNote:\nWhen I was finally able to retrieve the display window from the other screen I set my monitors to mirror in hopes that it would fix the problem.\nIt did not.\nHowever, when I opened the console by pressing alt + f6 (in order to double check the error message that I received while trying xrandr) and\nreturned to my desktop with alt + f7, my monitor came back to life.\nChanging it back to \"extend\" instead of \"mirror\" mode has not caused the error to reoccur.\nI have not noticed any error messages or warnings.\n", "Q: How to give specific port to Apache in Ubuntu 12.04 and port for mysql I am using xampp Apache server but it works locally i want to access it from public ip and i know the whole process but i am stuck how to change the port for Apache server because i dont want to access it with port 80 but is it possible that apache will run on other port please help and also how to change the port of mysql\n\nA: Simple , you can do it with listen  command.\nI mean open your terminal with CTRL+ALT+T then type as\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nThen make the line as \nListen 8000\n\nsave & close.\nrestart your apache server.\nnow your apache will start listening to port number 8000.\n", "Q: Error in ntop Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I am having the following errors, while starting ntop, i.e. when I type sudo ntop:\nError#1:\nFri Sep  6 09:01:52 2013  **ERROR** GeoIP: unable to load file GeoLiteCity.dat\nFri Sep  6 09:01:52 2013  **ERROR** GeoIP: unable to load ASN file GeoIPASNum.dat\nError#2:\nFri Sep  6 09:01:52 2013  INITWEB: Initializing TCP/IP socket connections for web server\nFri Sep  6 09:01:52 2013  **ERROR** INITWEB: binding problem - 'Address already in use'(98)\nFri Sep  6 09:01:52 2013  Check if another instance of ntop is running\nFri Sep  6 09:01:52 2013  or if the current user (-u) can bind to the specified port\nFri Sep  6 09:01:52 2013  **FATAL_ERROR** Binding problem, ntop shutting down...\n\nCan anyone please help how to solve this?\n\nA: This is what a top uses to populate the geolocation information of the remote network traffic.\nTo correct this:\nwget -N http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz\ngunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz\nwget -N http://download.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/asnum/GeoIPASNum.dat.gz\ngunzip GeoIPASNum.dat.gz\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/share/GeoIP/\nsudo mv GeoLiteCity.dat /usr/share/GeoIP/\nsudo mv GeoIPASNum.dat /usr/share/GeoIP/\n\nYou may like to update the GeoIP monthly to keep the data up to date.\nSource: http://www.mikereamy.com/2013/11/ntop-geoip-error/\n\nA: This means you are missing GeoIP.

The variable name of an array is simply the pointer to the beginning of the array.\nWhat you are doing in your example is actually subtracting the pointer to a from the pointer to b and then converting this resulting (pointer) value to an integer. Why the returned value is -16 I don't know. Probably this is just the size of memory blocks on the stack that are allocated at once (beware, pure speculation). \nIn order to subtract characters from each other, you have to really access them, either by using a[i] or *(a+i) for the ith character in the char array. \nFyi, the value of pointer subtraction is not random, but more or less arbitrary, since the addresses of the arrays a[] and b[] can differ from OS to OS and from compiler to compiler. I just tried your program on the PC I'm currently at, Debian Wheezy 64 bit, and the result is -16. Then I tried the same code on Xubuntu 12.04 32bit and the result is 5.\n\nA: You calculate the difference of pointer values.

I have been using this long before Ubuntu got ecyptfs and even though I keep my files private under ~/Private today I still have my old ~/safe which i use for sensitive information that doesn't need to be mounted all the time.\n# install encfs\nsudo apt-get install encfs\n\n# setup. directories need to be absolute paths\nSAFE=~/safe\nSAFE_ENC=~/.safe\nmkdir $SAFE\nmkdir $SAFE_ENC\n\n# this is for mounting the fs (or create for first time mount)\nencfs -i 10 $SAFE_ENC $SAFE\n\nThe first time you run this you'll be asked if you want to create a new encrypted filesystem. Just pressiong RETURN creates one with default options. The option -i 10 will make the drive get unmounted if there has been ten minutes of inactivity. Remember not to do cd $SAFE or to keep it open in a file manager since it's considered activity.\nIf you have several systems that are going to access this (eg. by having $SAFE_ENC in a cloud storage) you should create it with the oldest version of Ubuntu you have or else it might not work on that system if it gets created with a newer system. (it's possible but you need to specify options that are compatible) I've used this since 2006 and am very happy with it.\nEncfs has several applications. E.g. lately I have started using it for my USB thumb drive as well. I have a 16GB thumb that has 2GB live ubuntu-presistence with a 14GB which the live system mounts after asking for password. When using it from other systems i mount the drive manually in the terminal, but it would be trivial to get my systems to identify it as my safe drive and mount it with my keyring. I also mount it on my Windows work machine. \nWhen setting this up I found there are some supplimentary packages that can be used to manage encfs from the desktop environment and get it mouted like ecryptfs. \n\nA: If you want to encrypt data stored on the computer, there exists some different choises you can make.  You was offered them when you installed Ubuntu in the first place[1].\nBefore you do anything like this, make a back up of your data!  You have been warned!!!\nAll Disks\nThe obvious one, and the most secure, is to encrypt the whole disk[2].  In that way, noone can steal your computer and use any information stored in your computer, like your passwords in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow or look at your temporary files which will give lots of information away.\nSo to use that, look up dm-crypt/LUKS/cryptsetup for more information.\nDirectories in $HOME\nThere are also support for encryption of directories in your $HOME directory[3].  Either you can use the older version, which encrypt a separate directory called $HOME/Private or you could encrypt whole of your $HOME.  \nTo create an encrypted $HOME/Private, just run the command \necryptfs-setup-private \n\nin a terminal and this should be set up for you.\nTo encrypt a users $HOME, you need to install the package encryptfs-utils and then create a new user with the command \nsudo adduser --encrypt-home username\n\nwhere username should be the new users login name. You could still make your $HOME encrypted after installation, but remember to back up your data before doing this[4].\nEncrypting Removable Disks\nLastly, if you want to encrypt your USB Memory stick, you could do that too.  Just install package cryptsetup and partition it with the graphical tool gnome-disk-utility or follow the instruktions for doing this from the command line[5].\nFor more information about encryption of disks and directories, please read here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemHowto\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystems\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1449168\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemsOnRemovableStorage\n\nA: Because of recently found security vulnerabilities in Encfs, I switched to Cryfs (disclaimer: I'm also one of the developers there). The tool does what you're asking for and has advantages over eCryptfs or Encfs.\nOne advantage is that it also encrypts file sizes and directory structure. With Encfs or eCryptfs, anyone can see your directory structure and file sizes. This often makes more information public than you want to. Say you have a set of directories with ~20 files each and each file ~3MB. This is probably a music CD collection. Or say you store a copy of a Windows 8 DVD in your file system. That is easily figured out by comparing directory structure and file sizes of the Windows 8 DVD with the structure of your encrypted file system.\nCryfs is a quite new project, but I already use it for some time to encrypt my Dropbox folder and didn't have any problems so far.\nThere is an easy Tutorial to help you get started.\n", "Q: How to keep the coloring in bash when using `sudo -i`? I have changed PS1 variable in /etc/bash.bashrc to\nPS1=\"\\n\\[\\033[0;37m\\]\\342\\224\\214\\342\\224\\200\\$(if [[ \\$? == 0 ]]; then echo \\\"[\\[\\033[0;32m\\]\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\342\\234\\223\\[\\033[0;37m\\]]\\342\\224\\200\\\"; else echo \\\"[\\[\\033[0;32m\\]\\[\\033[01;31m\\]\\342\\234\\227\\[\\033[0;37m\\]]\\342\\224\\200\\\"; fi)[$(if [[ ${EUID} == 0 ]]; then echo '\\[\\033[0;31m\\]\\h'; else echo '\\[\\033[0;33m\\]\\u\\[\\033[0;37m\\]@\\[\\033[0;96m\\]\\h'; fi)\\[\\033[0;37m\\]]\\342\\224\\200[\\[\\033[0;32m\\]\\w\\[\\033[0;37m\\]]\\n\\[\\033[0;37m\\]\\342\\224\\224\\342\\224\\200\\342\\224\\200\\342\\225\\274 \\[\\033[0m\\]\"\n\nWhich works fine with all the commands. But when I run sudo -i command, PS1 value goes to the default. To get back the color scheme, I have to run PS1=<same value> manually. Any idea what might be causing this behaviour?\n\nA: I was going to add PS1, following the answer by Alaa Ali, and I've found the following lines:\n# uncomment for a colored prompt, if the terminal has the capability; turned\n# off by default to not distract the user: the focus in a terminal window\n# should be on the output of commands, not on the prompt\nforce_color_prompt=no\n\nI've changed it to force_color_prompt=yes, then exit, login back, and voilà! Colors!\nI'm on Ubuntu (disco), hope that this help. I think that it's better than PS1 because there's a lot of code that depends on this variable, I don't know exactly what's doing, but somebody has written it, I don't want to waste his/her time :-)\n\nA: Add the PS1 line to /root/.bashrc.\nThe reason why the color goes back to default is because when you do sudo -i, it \"simulates\" a root login, and in turn sources (applies) root's .bashrc, which brings the color back to the default. So adding the PS1 line to root's .bashrc should do the trick.\n", "Q: How Linux Host can access guest's sharing network on Virtualbox?

(Using a program to set the automatic mounting: \"Storage Device Manager\" - pysdm.)\nAt a certain point I wanted this for an external drive (fat32) that is most of the time connected to the computer, which was not usually mounted when the computer started.\nAll went well until I noticed that in Thunar it was not possible to create new folder (or file) - the option was greyed out - on the external drive (while on the ntfs partition all was well):\n\nI have also noticed that the use of the  \"Storage Device Manager\" in the way presented by the linked answer had changed the mount point of the drives involved: before, external drive's point had been /media/cipricus/SAMSUNG/, now it is /media/sdb1/; the ntfs drive had the mount point /media/cipricus/3060-0887/ and now it is /media/sda5/. (But, as specified, there is no problem with the ntfs partition.)\nUninstalling the program and trying to go back to the older situation didn't work, the partition and the external drive continued to mount at the new mount points.\n\nUPDATE: I was able to revert to the old mount points by using the same program, but this did not solve the issue with the external drive. Even worse, I had to un-check the options for mounting at boot for both drives involved for the boot was stopped with an error message that mounting them was not possible.\n\nWhat I want  is to find a way to go back to the situation from before installing the program and making those settings in the first place. \n\n(A second external drive, for which I didn't used \"Storage Device Manager\" to make it mount at startup, keeps mounting the usual way, /media/cipricus/USB-HDD/, and I can create folders on that one.)\n\nA: Changing the ownership and permission may help you to access your drive.\nThese steps would help you to do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*First un-mount your /dev/sdb1 drive\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\n\n\n*And then change the ownership of /media/sdb1 to working user.\nsudo chown -R cipricus:cipricus /media/sdb1\n\nif cipricus is your Ubuntu user's name (if this command fails says: directory not found then ignore previous step i,e un-mounting)\n\n*Then change the access permission\nsudo chmod -R 774 /media/sdb1\n\n\n*And last mount the driver again.\nsudo mount -a\n\nif it doesn't mount then try to mount from icon from your home folder or from gparted.\nReply what happens..\n\nA: First of all, try to not use anymore PySDM sience this application is deprecated starting with Ubuntu 12.10 and higher. Futhermore, starting with Ubuntu 12.10, the default mount points was moved to /media/$USER and from here your problems which collide head with PySDM.\nSo, instead to use anymore PySDM, I suggest you to use AriOS Automount (.deb) (see here how to install a \".deb\" file):\n\nAriOS Automount is a small utility [...] and its main advantage over\n  PySDM is that it doesn't require any kind of configuration: just\n  install it and you're done, all your partitions (it should work with\n  any kind of partition: EXT4/3/2, NTFS, FAT and so on) will be\n  automatically mounted the next time you log in.\nAriOS Automount works without touching /etc/fstab and it can be\n  enabled / disabled either from the Startup Applications or via the\n  menu, by launching \"Auto-mount Settings\".\n\nSource: How To Mount Partitions Automatically On Startup In Linux ~ Ubuntu / Linux blog.\nIn Xfce \"Auto-mount Settings\" appears under Menu/System\n\nAnd can be enabled/disabled easily\n\n\nIf I have not convinced you and you sill want to use PySDM, try to change the mount point to /media/$user/devicename (/media/cipricus/SAMSUNG, respectively /media/cipricus/3060-0887/):\n\nAnd:\n\n\nA: One thing might be a problem here:\nYou cannot generally use\n\n/dev/sdb1\n\nor\n\n/dev/sdc1\n\nto assign permissions or ownership.\nYou need to use the name of the mountpoint (here /media/username) and change permissions and ownership there. So if your \n\n/dev\n\nis\n\n/sdb1\n\nand your mountpoint is\n\n/media/username/22a67f76\n\n(here \"username\" is your username you are logged in with)\nYour Stick will be mounted to a similar UUID.\nThen the commands will look like this:\n1)\nYou let the USB Stick automount as usual. (Plug it in) Check if it still mount to the same mountpoint. (just in case)\n2) \n\nsudo chown -R username:users /media/username/22a67f76\n\nannotations:\nusername = your username you are logged in with\nusers = group \"users\"\n3)\n\nsudo chmod -R 777 /media/username/22a67f76\n\nannotations:\nusername = your username you are logged in\nwith 777 = full access!!\nDone!

Open up gnome-terminal (the \"Terminal\" application), then go to 'Edit' and 'Profile Preferences'.\nMake sure you're editing the 'default' profile, and go to the \"Title and Command\" tab.\nUnder \"Command\" there are three checkboxes: \"Run command as a login shell\", \"Update login records when command is launched\", and \"Run a custom command instead of my shell\".\nI checked all three boxes, and under \"Custom command:\" I put zsh.\nI also set \"When command exits:\" to \"Exit the terminal\" so it closes the terminal window.\nHit the \"Close\" button, then exit gnome-terminal and then reopen it.  It should now start zsh instead of Bash.\n\nA: There is a workaround if you cannot get zsh running by default.\ntry editing the .bashrc file at the home directory.\nadd the command zsh in the end. This will start zsh as soon as you enter the shell.\nBut you have to exit the terminal twice to fully exit.\n", "Q: Add Steadyflow to startup apps What's the command to add Steadyflow download manager to the startup apps list?\n\nA: The command to use is \n/usr/bin/steadyflow\n\n\n", "Q: What is the diference between the images of Ubuntu Touch?

I may not be phrasing my question correctly, but I'll do my best to explain the symptoms I'm experiencing. First, for context, I'm running an Ubuntu server (no GUI), version 12.04.3 LTS (according the the lsb_release utility). I generally do all of my work in tmux,  I connect to the server via Putty, and I use vim for all my text editing.\nNow for the symptoms. Since I use tmux, I usually have a few windows open at all times. One of them houses a node server I've been playing around with, and it lives in a subdirectory of my user account's home (specifically, ~/battleship). The server interacts with a webpage I'm also hosting off of the server using nginx, and all the website code lives in /usr/share/nginx/www/bs (I also keep a separate window open for editing the client source). What happens is that after several hours of leaving the server window idle and untouched, it seems to fall out of sync. I can run ls and see the files, and I can open them for editing (vim server.js). When I do that, however, regardless of whether I make changes and save or just quit out instantly, when I run ls again I see a .server.js.swp file, and none of my changes (if I made any) persist. If I move out of that directory and then back in, it fixes itself - I can open the file and edit it successfully, without leaving behind a .swp when I close it. I mentioned the client source half of things because I've noticed that this doesn't happen in the /www folder (presumably because it's outside of my user account's home directory).\nAfter that wall of text, my question is this: Does anyone know why this is happening, and how to prevent it? I can only imagine there's some way, considering that this isn't the only Linux server I connect to via Putty and use tmux/vim on, and yet it's the only one where this weird behavior happens. Any help would be appreciated.\nNote: I tagged this with bash, tmux, and putty because I'm assuming one of them is to blame but I really have no clue which.\nUpdate: This is the output of cat /proc/mount as requested by Gilles (albeit with my username and the values of ecryptfs_fnek_sig and ecryptfs_sig censored, because while I don't actually know what those two things are, they seem encryption-related, and better safe than sorry).\nrootfs / rootfs rw 0 0\nsysfs /sys sysfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0\nproc /proc proc rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0\nudev /dev devtmpfs rw,relatime,size=2008532k,nr_inodes=502133,mode=755 0 0\ndevpts /dev/pts devpts rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000 0 0\ntmpfs /run tmpfs rw,nosuid,relatime,size=807840k,mode=755 0 0\n/dev/disk/by-uuid/2da27263-f079-47ba-90ad-66e4c3a53810 / ext4 rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered 0 0\nnone /sys/fs/fuse/connections fusectl rw,relatime 0 0\nnone /sys/kernel/debug debugfs rw,relatime 0 0\nnone /sys/kernel/security securityfs rw,relatime 0 0\nnone /run/lock tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=5120k 0 0\nnone /run/shm tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime 0 0\n/home/[username]/.Private /home/[username] ecryptfs rw,relatime,ecryptfs_fnek_sig=[censored],ecryptfs_sig=[censored],ecryptfs_cipher=aes,ecryptfs_key_bytes=16,ecryptfs_unlink_sigs 0 0\n\nUpdate 2: Here's the output of uname -a:\nLinux [server-name] 3.5.0-39-generic #60~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Aug 14 15:38:41 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nUpdate 3: I completed a pass of memtest.

Have you tried in an unencrypted file system?\nSorry I cannot post comments yet.  Not enough points.\n\nA: FWIW the issue is displayed by the ls command, not by bash.\nThe fact that you see the file means it is still there.  Nothing is out of sync with anything else and no amount of running sync will stop you from using the only cached copy of the relevant file system data.  sync will just cause the data to commit to permanent storage, not change your view of it.\nAre you using VIM sessions?  I don't know VIM session, never used it myself, but I imagine tmux might cause the VI session manager to not realize the file is closed and to keep your changes being tracked. \n\nA: You could try running the sync command in between your bash commands.\nsync - flush file system buffers\n\nI have never found the need for that myself but have known at least one person who typed it practically as every second command! Must have been burned badly in the past with slow disk.\nThe internet seems to be light on discussion of the use of the sync command. Here is a link to very short manual entry for sync:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/sync-invocation.html\nsync guarantees that data is written from memory to disk device. The data could still be in disk device cache memory and not written to disk if the disk device itself is slow or has a problem.\nYou are running an ubuntu server . . . is that a machine on your desktop?

Sometimes calculations overcome total memory available of machine, 64GB RAM, and starts to use swap. When this happen Ubuntu just stop and it is necessary to reboot. Runing the same simulations with linux Slackware it did not happen, instead of that, the simulations that have been stopped and I have an error in terminal, something like that: \"segmentation fault\". Is It possible to run the simulations in Ubuntu and overcome the problem of Ubuntu's stops, like Slackware?\nThanks.\n\nA: If you're getting segmentation faults when you run your simulation software in one system, and massive slowdown when you run it in another, then your simulation software is not meant to handle not having enough memory. Any segmentation fault is an indication of a bug, and often bugs that produce segmentation faults are really bugs where the behavior of code is undefined. On different systems it may act in different (wrong) ways.\nSo:\n\n*\n\n*If you or someone you work with wrote the simulation software, you should debug it with the hope of improving performance. I'd recommend starting by compiling it with debug symbols (gcc -g ...) and debugging interactively (for example, in gdb) on Slackware to produce a stack trace of the segmentation fault.\nYou should also debug it to find memory leaks. You can use Valgrind, Boehm GC running in leak detection mode, or a variety of other tools for this.\nOf course, the most appropriate way to debug it will depend on details of how it works and what language it's written in.\n\n\n*If you got the simulation software from a totally separate party, you should report a bug. If a debug build or debug symbols are available to you, the bug report would benefit from including a stack trace of the segmentation fault on the Slackware system.\nThere might be some things you can do to terminate the simulation in Ubuntu.\nThe whole system shouldn't grind to a halt. That is likely to indicate a bug in Ubuntu, possibly in the kernel. Even massive disk I/O should only slow down Ubuntu moderately. You might want to report a bug in Ubuntu's kernel about this.\nIf you want to do that, first read this. Then you'd start the bug reporting process by running ubuntu-bug linux (or if it's a command-line only system, apport-cli linux).\nTo work around the problem, you can try limiting available memory by specifying limits in limits.conf. See also this blog post.\nIn case the problem has something to do with CPU priority, you can run the simulation at a lower priority with nice (e.g., nice -n 15 command...) or lower it while running with renice.\nIf you can use the machine at all as it slows down and the simulation needs to be stopped (sometimes a virtual console responds better than the GUI), you can try killing the process with the KILL signal (which is the strongest way to kill a process):\nkill -KILL command\nHere command is just one word, the name of the executable. All executables with that name will be killed (hence \"killall\").

The theoretical limit of RAM is caused by the limit of adresses. With 32bit technology, the effective limit is about 3,4 GB.\nThe RAM of 64bit systems is for the moment not limited by such a number, but much more by the lack of possibility to build machines with that much RAM. Wikipedia says, the limit is 16 Exabyte.\nHope this helped.\n\nA: As your PC has 16 GiB of RAM installed, a single 32 bit application running on a 32 bit kernel can use a little bit larger than 3 GiB (not 4 GiB as it has to share a portion of its memory with the linux kernel). \nA 64 bit application on a 64 bit kernel will have a much higher \"usable\" address space essentially limited by the overcommiting configuration.\nIf you plan to really make use of a lot of allocated page, you need to make sure these pages are backed either by RAM or by swap area. For example, if you have configured the swap partition to be 16 GiB, you won't be able to access more than 32 GiB minus the amount of memory already reserved by the kernel and by other applications running.\nThere is an exception to that limitation. If you use read-only or shared memory mapped files, there will be no need to paginate out their content to the swap area so their size will add to the usable address space of your program.\nIn your case, I then would suggest to use memory mapped files to load and possibly process your RGB images. Beware though that if your working set of memory significantly exceed the RAM size, performance will severely be degraded due to memory thrashing. \n", "Q: Bluetooth mouse OKLICK 406S connects, but work as a battery level indicator, not mouse in Ubuntu 13.04 $ upower -d\nDevice: /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/line_power_AC0\n  native-path:          /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00/ACPI0003:00/power_supply/AC0\n  power supply:         yes\n  updated:              Fri Aug 16 02:32:44 2013 (315 seconds ago)\n  has history:          no\n  has statistics:       no\n  line-power\n    online:             yes\n\nDevice: /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0\n  native-path:          /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00/PNP0C0A:00/power_supply/BAT0\n  vendor:               A25\n  model:                A15--22\n  power supply:         yes\n  updated:              Fri Aug 16 02:32:49 2013 (310 seconds ago)\n  has history:          yes\n  has statistics:       yes\n  battery\n    present:             yes\n    rechargeable:        yes\n    state:               fully-charged\n    energy:              53.732 Wh\n    energy-empty:        0 Wh\n    energy-full:         53.732 Wh\n    energy-full-design:  60.2 Wh\n    energy-rate:         0 W\n    voltage:             16.676 V\n    percentage:          100%\n    capacity:            89.2558%\n    technology:          lithium-ion\n\nDevice: /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_hid_30o03o01o25o02o2f_battery\n  native-path:          /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.2/1-1.2:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:22/0005:056E:0061.0004/power_supply/hid-30:03:01:25:02:2f-battery\n  model:                Laser  BTmouse\n  power supply:         no\n  updated:              Fri Aug 16 02:37:49 2013 (10 seconds ago)\n  has history:          yes\n  has statistics:       yes\n  battery\n    present:             yes\n    rechargeable:        yes\n    state:               discharging\n    energy:              0 Wh\n    energy-empty:        0 Wh\n    energy-full:         0 Wh\n    energy-full-design:  0 Wh\n    energy-rate:         0 W\n    percentage:          100%\n    capacity:            100%\n\nDaemon:\n  daemon-version:  0.9.20\n  can-suspend:     yes\n  can-hibernate:   no\n  on-battery:      no\n  on-low-battery:  no\n  lid-is-closed:   no\n  lid-is-present:  yes\n  is-docked:       no\n\nI have the battery indicator of my OKLICK Bluetooth mouse (model 406S) in place of my laptop battery indicator.

I'm new to Linux. I loaded Ubuntu on my Mac and I'm booting it with rEFInd. I see two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\n*EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\nThey both boot into Ubuntu. \nWhat's the difference between the two and which one should I use? Did I do something wrong that made both show up?\n\nA: Typically, EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP) is the GRUB binary, and EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi is the binary for shim. The latter is a relatively simple program that provides a way to boot on a computer with Secure Boot active. On such a computer, an unsigned version of GRUB won't launch, and signing GRUB with Microsoft's keys is impossible, so shim bridges the gap and adds its own security tools that parallel those of Secure Boot. In practice, shim registers itself with the firmware and then launches a program called grubx64.efi in the directory from which it was launched, so on a computer without Secure Boot (such as a Mac), launching shimx64.efi is just like launching grubx64.efi. On a computer with Secure Boot active, launching shimx64.efi should result in GRUB starting up, whereas launching grubx64.efi directly probably won't work.\nNote that there's some ambiguity possible. In particular, if you want to use a boot manager or boot loader other than GRUB in a Secure Boot environment with shim, you must call that program grubx64.efi, even though it's not GRUB. Thus, if you were to install rEFInd on a Secure Boot-enabled computer, grubx64.efi could be the rEFInd binary. This binary would probably not reside in EFI/ubuntu, though; both it and a shim binary would probably go in EFI/refind. Also, as you've got a Mac (which doesn't support Secure Boot), there's no need to install rEFInd in this way; it makes much more sense to install rEFInd as EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi (its default location and name).\nNote that the rEFInd documentation includes a whole page on Secure Boot. Chances are you won't benefit from reading it, user190735, since you're using a Mac. I mention it only in case some other reader comes along who's trying to use rEFInd in conjunction with Secure Boot.\n", "Q: Virtualbox stopped working in 12.04 LTS after I upgraded kernel using hardware enablement stack I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) with kernel 3.8 now.

Seeing as you're in a VM, you shouldn't have any problems with other OSes or partitions.\nJust choose the 1st option here:\n\n\nA: just load the setup disc or iso or whatever you use and complete setup! when it says erase disk and install ubuntu dont worry about your real computer just click it and its installed automatically :)\n", "Q: nexus 4 bootloader only after trying to flash Ubuntu on my nexus 4 ,the process was some how interrupted and my phone is unusable except for the boot-loader.is there any one who can help with this?\n\nA: The easiest thing to do would probably be to start fresh.

I am completely new to Ubuntu 13.04 and I do not have much experience using terminal. However, I would like to assign the \"zoom\" button on my Performance MX mouse to show workspaces... I find the particular button worthless for actually zooming in and out.\nI also want to assign the \"application button\" to \"spread windows\" (at least what it is called in the unity tweak tool).\nHow do I go about changing these settings permanently?\n\nA: You have probably figured this out by now, but for reference here is how to get the functionality you mentioned. The Logitech Performance MX 950 is also called just the Performance MX in some markets, so these instructions work for both the \"Performance MX 950\" and \"Performance MX\" models.\nSetting up Zoom and Window switcher buttons\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the CompizConfig Settings Manager\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Open the settings manager, either through the Unity menu or by typing ccsm in a terminal.\n\n*Go to the \"Scale\" plugin. Under the tab \"Bindings\", assign Button 10 to \"Initiate Window Picker For All Windows\" by clicking on the button in the row with the mouse icon. This will give you the spread windows functionality, using all windows from all workspaces. If you prefer to just see the windows from the current workspace, instead assign the \"Initiate Window Picker\" shortcut.\n\n*Go back, and open the settings for the \"Expo\" plugin. Assign Button 13 to the \"Expo Button\" setting. This will give you the show workspaces functionality.\nAll the other buttons should work out of the box in Ubuntu, at least they do for me with Ubuntu 14.04. Do not be tempted to change any other settings in ccsm, as you can easily break your system with it.\nAdditional tip: You can run xev in a terminal to see exactly which buttons are currently pressed.\nSetting up Solaar for additional settings, and managing the Unifying receiver\nTo manage the Unifying receiver and change a few settings on the Performance MX (scroll sensitivity, DPI settings), you'll need to install Solaar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:daniel.pavel/solaar\n\n\n*Update your sources:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install solaar:\nsudo apt-get install solaar\n\n\n*Run Solaar from the Unity menu. To make it work for the first time, you'll need to unplug the receiver, plug it back in, and turn the mouse off/on.\n\n*Solaar will run in the background and show a small indicator in the top menu bar (next to the Wifi indicator). You can configure your devices or quit Solaar from there.\n\n*Solaar will add itself to the Startup Applications, which will make it start automatically on login.

In my example, 9299. This port\nnumber is must not being used by another process.  \n\n*Then you should add --enable-rpc=true --rpc-listen-port=9299 to the arguments.\n\n*You may specify additional argument such as --check=certificate=false. \n\n\nTo proof this, I ran uGet via console. Then I can see any output from aria2 in my console. \n\nResult\nIt works. uGet and aria2 finally work together. I've been waiting for ~3 months for this.\n\n\nA: My solution to exact same issue was this:\nIn UGet settings under plug-in tab change argument to this:\n--enable-rpc=true\nThen restart Uget and  aria2 should be working.\nUget version I use is 1.10.3. \n\n\nA: The error message Address already in use is telling you that localhost:6800 is occupied by some other programs.

I spent a week trying to do it on a virtual machine but could never get the ports to forward correctly so today I just dedicated the full machine. \nI installed Ubuntu server and followed the directions to install the LAMP stack. Everything worked perfectly. I configured my router, got the Apache welcome page, installed an ssh server, connected from a remote terminal, then connected with sftp and updated the index.html file. It's progress but I still feel pretty lost. \nMy biggest frustration is that I don't see anything when I am logged directly into Ubuntu from the terminal. I run ls and expect to see directories for Apache and MySQL but I see nothing. It's like I am look at an empty drive. Maybe I am. \nAt first, I thought I could create a public_html directory and scp files into it, but that didn't work. (Well, it worked but they weren't visible at the IP.) Then I discovered that I should probably work with the default directory structure /var/www only I can't see it from terminal? I do see it when I log on with filezilla. I don't get why I see it via sftp but not via ssh or directly on the server. I read through all the official documentation but it seems to take these basic issues for granted. Maybe someone can point me to other resources. I've been googling all day but not finding what I need to understand this better.\n\nA: The reason you don't see anything when you type ls is because you are in your user's home directory, and on a server install, your home directory is empty ;)  \nTo get to the root directory you will need to run the command\ncd / \n\nThis will take you to / (the root directory). From there you can use ls to see everything on your hard drive, including /var. You can jump straight to /var/www with the command \ncd /var/www\n\nTo edit anything outside of your user's home (e.g. /var/www) you need root privileges, which you get by appending all your commands with sudo.\n", "Q: USB PAM login with SD Card I am trying to set up a PAM login token.

For example, if your computer IP is 192.168.0.101, you can access apache from the same network with:\nhttp://192.168.0.101\n\nTo access your apache server from the WAN, you need a static IP/domain.

I am currently using Lubuntu in tandem with Windows 8 in a dual boot setup. Windows 8 is getting sluggish, so I want to do a clean install of it.

I want to make a LiveUSB (what works fine).\nBut is there a possibility to install programs in it?\n\nA: In order to do that you need to create a Persistent USB.  To do that under Windows you can download Universal USB Installer, once downloaded double click the file, and you are ready to create the presistent USB.  See image below.\n\nTo create a Persistent USB under Ubuntu look at Live Usb Pendrive Persistent\n\nA: Yes you can install programms, but it is not as stable as a real installation. In that case, I recommend installing Ubuntu directly on the Usb stick, as if it were a HDD. So you must use another usbstick or a livecd...\nUse ext2 for system partition. Otherwise it wont work.\n\nA: Just use persistence! Make a new USB using a program that supports persistence, but it should be quite large, at least 2gb. You need to have some extra space on the USB used for the casper rw stuff.\n", "Q: How can I remove Proprietary Sources I only enabled \"main\" and \"universe\" repos, but still proprietary software like \"steam\" are enabled and shown in the list, how can I remove them?\n\nA: I think that you are confused in this sense. First, if you want keep enabled only main and universe repositories, check your /etc/apt/sources.list to look something like this:\n##\n## ...comments...\n##\ndeb http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring main\ndeb-src http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring main\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring main universe\ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-security universe main\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring-updates universe main\nThen, from terminal, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nto resynchronize the package index files from their sources.\nAfter all of these are done, if you still have doubts that a certain package is from proprietary sources, you can check with the following command:\napt-cache madison package_name\nFor example:\n$ apt-cache madison firefox\n   firefox | 23.0+build2-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 | http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-security/main amd64 Packages\n   firefox | 23.0+build2-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-updates/main amd64 Packages\n   firefox | 20.0+build1-0ubuntu2 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring/main amd64 Packages\n$ apt-cache madison wallch\n    wallch | 3.01-0ubuntu2 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring/universe amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: If your proprietary software was installed via a .bundle file (such as it is with VMware player - my own current learning nemesis), then it may have an uninstaller command that you have to run (for example vmware-uninstall) ... check in the documentation for the products you installed from the developer's website ... they should have a getting started guide or something that explains how to uninstall it at a command line\n", "Q: I am unable to locate wine in Raring \n*\n\n*I have added repo, \n\n*added sources, \n\n*restarted, \n\n*reinstalled Ubuntu. \nI have entered just about every useful command in the book, but when I type apt-get install wine, I still get the message saying wine is unavailable, but is referred to by another packages, no installation candidate. \n\n\nI don't understand, what do I need to do? \n\nA: As you can see at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wine1.4 the wine package is only built on x86 based architectures. You cannot run x86 Windows programs on ARM without emulating the x86 instruction set as well. You would need to run an x86 version of Ubuntu inside a chroot under qemu for example, to be able to run any x86 Windows programs on your ARM system.\n", "Q: vmware-vix vmrun command error: \"unable to connect to host ... version not found\" VMWARE-VIX command \"vmrun\" failing\nI have checked in the online resources of the product documentation, and in discussion groups where other people experience the same issue.\nI have the following configuration\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 13.04 (x64)\n\n*VMware Player 6.0\n\n*VMware-VIX API 1.12.2\n\n\n... and when I try to run the command in the format:\n\n\n*\n\n*vmrun -T player start /path/vm.vmx\n\n\nI get an error:\n*Unable to connect to host.\nError: The specified version was not found.*\nForum proposed solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*others with the same issue claimed the solution was to edit a file\n\n*/usr/lib/vmware/configurator/vixwrapper-product-config.txt\n\n*to add / modify the line (to ensure it has your correct version of VM player)\n\n*player 16 vmdb 6.0.0 Workstation-10.0.0-and-vSphere-5.5.0\n\n\n... but when I open the player, it seems that I do already have v6.0.0 (according to the \"help > about\" menu item in the player GUI.\n... so if it is not the wrong version in that config file ... what is causing the problem?\nUPDATE\n\n\n*\n\n*when I try to run the command instead as just:\n\n\n$ vmrun start /path/vm.vmx (without the -T and \"player\" host type specification)\n...

Installing Workstation 10.0 does work and I noticed something. Workstation comes with Player 6.0 and VIX 1.13. I wonder why they haven't released 1.13 separately. \n\nA: Check the dash before the 'T' option in the vmrun command. I had copied it from this web page and it was using a long dash character instead of a regular dash:\nhttp://www.steelrat.info/en/ubuntu/zapusk-vmware-player-na-ubuntu-bez-graficheskogo-interfeysa/\nThis caused the error where it complained it could not find workstation:\nError: Service type VIX_SERVICEPROVIDER_VMWARE_WORKSTATION was specified, but not installed\n\nI got this same error when I used a lower case 't' instead of 'T', so I think this error message is from vmrun not getting the 'player' option.

Values include the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*discard – For new objects, no ACL entries are inherited when a file or directory is created. The ACL on the file or directory is equal to the permission mode of the file or directory.\n\n*noallow – For new objects, only inheritable ACL entries that have an access type of deny are inherited.\n\n*restricted – For new objects, the write_owner and write_acl permissions are removed when an ACL entry is inherited.\n\n*passthrough – When property value is set to passthrough, files are created with a mode determined by the inheritable ACEs. If no inheritable ACEs exist that affect the mode, then the mode is set in accordance to the requested mode from the application.\n\n*passthrough-x – Has the same semantics as passthrough, except that when passthrough-x is enabled, files are created with the execute (x) permission, but only if execute permission is set in the file creation mode and in an inheritable ACE that affects the mode.\n\n\n*aclmode: (again, I was unable to get this one to work for my version, so beware!) modifies ACL behavior when a file is initially created or whenever a file or directory's mode is modified by the chmod command. Values include the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*discard – All ACL entries are removed except for the entries needed to define the mode of the file or directory.\n\n*groupmask – User or group ACL permissions are reduced so that they are no greater than the group permission bits, unless it is a user entry that has the same UID as the owner of the file or directory. Then, the ACL permissions are reduced so that they are no greater than owner permission bits.\n\n*passthrough – During a chmod operation, ACEs other than owner@, group@, or everyone@ are not modified in any way. ACEs with owner@, group@, or everyone@ are disabled to set the file mode as requested by the chmod operation.\nFor example, you would set acl for \"tank/datatank\" (not your mount point, but the actual pool) this way:\nzfs set \"ACL-PROPERTY\"=\"ACL-MODE\" tank/datatank\n\nmore specifically\nzfs set aclinherit=passthrough tank/datatank\n\nSources:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/817-2271/gbaaz/index.html\nhttps://mywushublog.com/2012/05/zfs-and-acls-with-samba/\n", "Q: New Kernel Gives Purple Screen after Update in Ubuntu 12.10 I have a somewhat serious problem. (I am in Ubuntu 12.10) Yesterday, I clicked on the update manager to see if there were any updates. There were about 26, and when I investigated, I saw that they were for a kernel update. The new kernel was 3.5.0-40. (My old working kernel is 3.5.0-39) So I said, sure, I'll update my kernel. After I rebooted, I was stuck on a purple screen, so I pushed the power button and turned off my computer. After a bit of research, I realized the old kernel might work still. So I booted into it, and it worked like a charm. Then, I downloaded a program called Grub Customizer, (you can probably google it), and then changed my default boot entry to the old kernel. Now I don't have to go to the grub2 boot menu whenever I boot up, which is nice. However, I don't like it saying \"Mounting ramdisk\" whenever I boot up because I use the old kernel, but I can stay on that if there's no fix. So here are my questions:\n1.) Is the new kernel not working because of a graphics driver problem? I have a Intel Sandy Bridge Mobile graphics card, which works like a charm. (With the old kernel)\n2.) IS IT SAFE TO DELETE THE NEW KERNEL? I CAN NOT AFFORD TO SCREW UP MY COMPUTER! I have found lots of information about deleting old kernels, but not new ones.\n3.) If I do delete my new kernel, do I need to change the settings in Grub Customizer again? If so, to what?\nThanks for your help, and if there is no way to fix this, I am O.K. to stay on the old kernel. Thanks for your help/time. \n\nA: Yes you are absolutely right. I had installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 from live CD, which had actually the same version that Ubuntu 12.10 use. You can check it here Ubuntu LTS and Kernel Enablement Stack. I always faced lagging and sluggishness problem, although my Graphics driver was latest. Then installing a new Kernel 3.8.0 with latest graphics driver fixed my issue. I have also Intel inbuilt graphics card.\nActually You can install/remove any kernel you want. There is no problem on using one or multiple Kernels at a time. But sometime you should consider the Kernel Mapping to your Ubuntu Version. For example following link lists out the mapping of different kernel to different version of OS:\nUbuntu to Mainline kernel version mapping\nSo I suggest you to go through each post before taking such an action. You can get a complete information of Kernel installing/removing from following link:\nKernel Mainline Builds\nHope these links will help you to find out your solution.\n\nA: I had the same issue yesterday. I am now booting into the old kernel 3.5.0-39 which works like charm as you have already mentioned.\nIt is not so funny when your whole system breaks after you have updated it.\nI was quite angry but fortunately managed to fix the problem by myself.\nSo next time an update is proposed I will exactly look at what will be updated.\nIf it is a kernel update I will refuse to perform it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu video lens I am using Ubuntu 12.04.I have a problem about unity video lens.When I use filter ; for an example YouTube and just searched about fast and furious , it appears very different search results than the search results from YouTube site for the same topic.I want to appear the same result on video lens , that appears in YouTube site.I checked this for other sites like daily motion and I found the same problem.\nAlso, when I searched without a filter, I appears very unrealted or least related ones.Mostly Indian Videos.\nPlease help me in this problem.

Prior to them shutting down I had used a service called sync2em to organize my contacts.  They provided an exchange server and I could update my contacts real-time with any of my devices and my desktop client.  \nAlas they turned off their service and my contacts have turned into a big mess. I have various contacts on my ipad, iphone, windows 7 box, and a couple web email providers.  It's really become quite annoying and hampering my ability to get stuff done always having to dig around to find an email or a phone number. I've decided enough is enough.\nMy goal is to consolidate all of my contacts into one central server that I can use for not only emails, but address book, birthday, notes (for the contact), etc.  I do -NOT- want to use google, apple, or any of those companies to hold this data because -- well -- does this really require an explanation? I want to do this locally on my own server.\nHere's my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is an LDAP server appropriate for this?\n\n*If so what kind of applications would I install? Is this difficult to do?\n\n*Will this LDAP server conflict with this machines plex server functions? \n\n*If not, what kind of resources will it take up as basically just used for a address book?\n\n*Will I be able to update the LDAP server from all my devices provided I use a desktop client? The webmail provider I use is yandex.com.  The way they handle contacts is absolutely horrendous.\n\n*Can you think of any other type of way to accomplish this that may be a better solution than an LDAP server?\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: LDAP is not what you are looking for. You want a CardDAV / CalDAV server, which will store address cards and calendar info. DAViCal is available through the Ubuntu repositories and seems to suit your needs. You can get more info on it on their project website. To install in Ubuntu, open Terminal and run sudo apt-get install davical\nEdit:\nThe installation instructions provided on the davical website for do not work. The instructions provided at http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/DAViCal_tips are much more thorough and got me to a working CalDAV / CardDAV server. The one error I found in them is the path for adding calendars or address books to your clients; the path should be http://somedomain.example.com/caldav.php/username/calendar/ and .../username/addresses/ The calendar and addresses for each user or group need to be marked as Public for them to be shared out to other clients.\nI did remove the original davical postgres database and re-installed it. Originally, it did not provide an admin password on the first attempt, but again following the directions on ubuntuguide worked and I got the admin password for the davical database.\nIn my case, I have a registered domain and use dyn.com for dynamic DNS services for my domain. I added a domain entry for the DAViCal server there and set up a virtual Apache server using the parameters provided in the ubuntuguide instructions, as well as creating the configuration file for the domain. Once that was complete, I pointed my browser to that domain and was presented with the DAViCal login page.\nI have been able to add the calendars on both my Mac (in iCal) and Thunderbird on my Ubuntu box without problem. I was also able to add the CardDAV entry into Address Book on the Mac, but it is proving to be more difficult in Thunderbird since it seems there is no built-in capacity for CardDAV server subscriptions, but I will continue working on seeing if there is a solution to that issue.\n", "Q: Slow and laggy scrolling in Firefox with FGLRX installed I have ubuntu 13.04 and kde 4.11.1\nMy problem is that firefox scrolling is slow and laggy.\nI'll give you some more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox 23.0\n\n*my video card is an ATI HD6870 and I have the FGLRX drivers 13.4 installed\n\n*it's not related to flash because it happens even on web pages where there is not flash\n\n*it's not related to ads because I use plugins to block ads\n\n*it also happens with unity so it's not a desktop environment related problem\n\n*it's not about the number of addons I have installed because I have done a fresh firefox installation and it happens the same and I have the same number of addons on firefox on windows and it works better on windows\n\n*I have tried both these addons for smooth scrolling https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/yet-another-smooth-scrolling/ and https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/smoothwheel/ and the scrolling is worse with them\n\n*I have activated \"no tearing desktop\" in catalyst control center because I need it when playing mkv movies and \"catalyst A.I\"\n\n*I have also installed chromium and it's much smoother and faster and I have no scrolling problems with it so\n\n*I also have a notebook with ubuntu 13.04, kde and same firefox version with same addons, it has a nvidia video card and scrolling is much smoother and faster in firefox rather than on my computer with the ati video card\n\n\nAny advice to solve it? \nThanks\n\nA: ATI's proprietary drivers are notorious for their bad 2D performance. Unfortunately there is not much you can do about this for now. However, Ubuntu 13.10 will ship with Linux >3.11 which comes with significant performance and power management improvements to the open source radeon drivers, which have always been better at 2D rendering.\nI woul advise you to try upgrading to 13.10 when it's released in October. Until then, I fear, you will have to deal with the performance issues surrounding FGLRX.\n\nA: Try setting these options I also have the fglrx drivers. I'm using an older version but firfox scrolling was much slower than chromes. \nI changed some options on firefox's preferences. \nIn the general tab, un-check the \"Use hardware acceleration when available\" and check \"Use autoscrolling\" and \"Use smooth scrolling\".\nIt's a simple change but removing the hardware acceleration seemed to have improved my scrolling and button performance a bit more where I no longer feel like tearing my hair out. Good luck.\n\nA: These settings worked for me with Elementary OS Luna, 'X.Org X Server 1.11.3' (From 'X -version' in terminal) and legacy 13.1 drivers from ppa:makson96/fglrx on a ATI Mobility Radeon 4570 graphics card. \nIn Firefox, type \"about:config\" in address bar and set: \n\n\n*\n\n*gfx.xrender.enabled = false \n\n*layers.acceleration.force-enabled = true\n\n\nIn Firefox preferences -> General tab, check:\n\n\n*\n\n*use autoscrolling\n\n*use smooth scrolling \n\n*use hardware acceleration when available \n\n\nNow type \"sudo aticonfig --initial\" (if you haven't generated a xorg.conf file already) and then \"sudo amdcccle\" to launch Catalyst Control Center and do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable tear free desktop in display options\n\n*Set \"wait for vertical refresh\" to \"always on\" in 3d->more settings\n\n\n(Optional)\nMy other settings in Catalyst Control Center are as follows.

So, I fixed that issue by simply removing that installed mesa acceleration package like this:\naptitude remove libgl1-mesa-dri\n\nI don't know why it had worked but it fixed that issue without to change Firefox's settings.\nAny explanation for validating that newbie's trick will be welcome.\n", "Q: Manually synchronize a webdav share with a local folder I am running Ubuntu 13.04.\nI want to manually synchronize a local folder with a webdavs share.\nI can type Control-l in Nautilus (Files), type in the davs://user@myserver.com:port/ and mount the folder without any difficulty. I am not getting the syncing part.\n\nA: Once the webdav folder is mounted, you then need to run some sort of syncronisation. I have often used rsync for things like network device mirroring. Rsync allows you to dictate which folder has priority i.e. which direction to sync in, and allows you to add credentials although they shouldn't be needed if your Nautilus connection works ok.\nThe only problem you've got is that rsync is command driven and you need to find the mount point of your webdav folder for the command string. I've got nautilus-open-terminal installed so I can right-click in a folder in Nautilus and open the terminal in that location. Seems to be the easiest way to find that mount point.\n", "Q: Best version for Dell Mini 1210 I went from Ubuntu version 8 something to 13.04 and the system is slow to the point of unuseable.

I reverted to 12.04 which is an LTS (supported until 2017!), and doesn't require graphics acceleraction. 12.04 is not exactly snappy either on such an old machine, but I find it very acceptable. \n", "Q: How to install Citrix receiver? How can I install Citrix Receiver on Ubuntu 13.04?\n\nA: Citrix Receiver requires OpenMotif v2.3.1 or greater to use the Graphical User Interface.\nThe first step is to install OpenMotif 2.3.1.  You can download OpenMotif from Launchpad.  Once downloaded and installed, download Citrix Receiver. deb file.  \nOnce downloaded, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, navigate to the folder where the file was downloaded (probably the Downloads folder), and run the command(s) below:\nsudo dpkg -i <file_name>.deb\n\nFor more info visit Citrix\nEdit\nIf you get the eeror below installing the 64bit \ndpkg: error processing icaclient (--install): subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 2 Errors were encountered while processing: icaclient\n\nTry this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install the .deb and let it fail\n\n*Edit /var/lib/dpkg/info/icaclient.postinst\n\n*Replace the line that says echo $Arch|grep \"i[0-9]86&quot; >/dev/null with *echo $Arch|grep -E \"i[0-9]86|x86_64\" >/dev/null (note the -E after grep!)\n\n*Run sudo dpkg --configure icaclient\nSource for Edit:Citrix Forums\n\nA: A little update 3 years later:\nDownload the .deb file from Citrix and click open.

Here's the thing : \nI removed all languages except FR (french) from the iso, everything works perfectly if I make an offline installation. Everything is in french, the post-install language tool only shows me the FR languages (french and canadian), without any extra packages to download. \nBut things are getting wierd when I install with a internet connection, Ubiquity wants to install EN packages, even if I decided to make a french installation. And of course, he wants to download ~150mo of packages. \nI looked up in /usr/lib/ubiquity/localechooser/* and usr/share/ubiquity/localechooser-apply, but I can't see where does Ubiquity choose to add EN to my languages. \nDoes anyone have an idea to prevent Ubiquity to download and install EN languages in addition of selected language ? \nI could of course let the EN packages on the iso, but in my opinion, it's a waste of space, since I don't need them. \nThank you !\n\nA: I found a workaround without having to play with preseeds. \nLocate on the iso squashfs: etc/lib/ubiquity/localechooser/localechooser\n    # Always support English (unless preseeded otherwise), so that we\n    # get English language packs etc.\n    if [ \"$english\" ]; then\n        db_set $tpl_supportedlocales \"$new\"\n    else\n        db_set $tpl_supportedlocales \"${new:+$new, }en_US.UTF-8\"\n    fi\n}\n\nI changed the following lines : \n    # Always support English (unless preseeded otherwise), so that we\n    # get English language packs etc.\n    if [ \"$english\" ]; then\n        db_set $tpl_supportedlocales \"$new\"\n    else\n        # MODIFIED, original line is commented below\n        # db_set $tpl_supportedlocales \"${new:+$new, }en_US.UTF-8\"\n        # Either or not the language is english, keep only the selected language.\n        db_set $tpl_supportedlocales \"$new\"\n    fi\n}\n\nIt works great. \n", "Q: How can I enable hardware acceleration for flash on Intel graphics?

Does anybody know how to fix this?\nTo reproduce the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put an alias in $HOME/.mailrc\nalias foo me@whatever.com\n\n*Try to mail the alias:\n$ echo hello | /usr/bin/mail -s testing foo\n\n*Read /var/log/mail.log and see \"foo\" bounce as an unknown user:\nSep 7 11:15:39 mycomputer postfix/local[9707]: EE038F6028B: to=<foo@mycomputer.mydomain>, relay=local, delay=0.1, delays=0.07/0/0/0.03, dsn=5.1.1, status=bounced (unknown user: \"foo\")\nHowever, my other mail programs, such as Emacs VM, respect the aliases in $HOME/.mailrc.\nThis didn't used to happen in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, my previous system.\nOn further investigation... I ran:\n$ mail -f mymailbox\n? alias foo\nfoo        me@whatever.com\n\nSo /usr/bin/mail is indeed processing $HOME/.mailrc, but somehow, even though \"mail\" knows the alias \"foo\", the result is that postfix sees an email message to \"foo@mycomputer.mydomain\" instead of the alias expansion. I don't know who's misconfigured: mail (GNU mailutils) or postfix.\n\nA: I did:\nsudo apt-get install bsd-mailx\n\nand the problem went away. The mail programs provided by bsd-mailx support .mailrc aliases, while apparently the ones in mailutils do not.\nCredit to mdpc (https://askubuntu.com/users/5863/mdpc) for leading me to this solution in his comment above.\n\nA: From my recollection....the mail program is a bare bones local mail delivery agent and is generally called from programs such as sendmail.  I have found that the mailx program is the more user friendly program that has a lot more whistles and bells.  If I recall mailx is available and can be used on nearly all Linux/UNIX systems.\nI got into the habit of using mailx over mail way back in the Solaris days.\n\nA: So bsd-mailx may not have this problem; but, it also has a lot fewer features than gnu mailutils.\nI also ran into this problem recently on a new Ubuntu install; but, discovered that the following in my ~/.mailrc fixed the problem:\nset inplacealiases\n\nThat's it. Aliases worked after I did that.\n\nA: After you have installed the mail server using something like sudo apt-get install mailutils and created the aliases file, you need to let the system read and create a hash file of the aliases configuration.\nsudo newaliases\n\nChanging the aliases file without running the above command afterwards will not make any changes for the system.\nThis post might be relevant to your question.\n", "Q: How to overcome burn problems or buy installation disk? I have tried and tried to download and burn Ubuntu 13.04 without success. The first time took 18 hours.

Firstly, there are many sites that you might not think of when you create the whitelist that you DO want to browse to, and you'll have to add them to the whitelist manually as you discover these sites. Secondly, even if you whitelist a certain site, that site may have some feature or section you are not aware of, which lets you upload stuff still. They might even introduce this as a \"new\" feature after you add it to the whitelist.\n\n\nIt is not possible in the general case to absolutely prevent any file on your system from being uploaded to the internet, without disconnecting entirely from the internet.\n", "Q: What advantages does markdown have over asciidoc? I've been using Asciidoc ever since I discovered it and use it a lot to be my defacto README text file.  It's readable in text and it can output all kinds of other formats, like man pages, pdf, html, etc.  \nLately I've been seeing more and more FLOSS projects using markdown.  It's slick as far as I can tell, but it still feels far more limited then Asciidoc.  Even github seems to support .md better then asciidoc.  Am I missing something? Is there a reason so many people are using .md? \nI would think the portability of asciidoc and one text file to bind them all makes it much more powerful.  \nIf anyone has any insights, or can tell my why markdown (MD) is so amazing, I'll buy you a virtual beer.\n\nA: Markdown is a TREND. There is no reason to switch to markdown if you're satisfied and confortable with asciidoc. Markdown is fragmented and quite limited in comparison to other markup languages such as asciidoc, txt2tags or reStructuredText.\n\nA: Markdown has some critical mass, and the grammar is smaller than that of Asciidoc.\nMarkdown does have the drawback that if you want something more complicated you're out of luck, or into implementation-specific syntax that may not fit well whereas Asciidoc can scale up.\nThere is a g+ post by Dan Allen comparing them and prefering Asciidoc.\n\nA: Ubiquitous usage of Markdown would be its greatest strength. Markdown is supported in Github, Reddit, WhatsApp, Viber etc.\nA lot of editors support Makrdown as Atom ReText and Emacs.\nThe syntax of Markdown is smaller than Asciidoc, Makrdown is basically headers, bold, italics, numbered list, bulleted list, links, inline code and code block. This finiteness has its appeal as one can confidently declare that they know EVERY COMMAND in Markdown.\nMarkdown flavours eg R Markdown, MultiMarkdown, Common Markdown offer functionality that's close to Asciidoc but, they are not compatible and not widely supported.\n", "Q: How can I burn a 706MB image onto a 703MB CD? The Ubuntu image ubuntu-12.04.3-alternate-i386.iso is 706MB large.\nI thought that little 3MB extra at the end is just the MB/MiB error - so the image should fit on the disk. But I was wrong. \nMy disk has 703MB. Is there a trick to burn the image regardless?\n\nA: Try this.  It worked for me about 75% of the time.  I used ImgBurn, and set the default Overburning Method to Truncate.\n\n\nA: Options are to \n\n\n*\n\n*burn it on a DVD; or \n\n*use the directions to create a bootable USB stick.\n\n\nWhat is on the ISO is what they felt was the minimum needed for distributing an installer.\nAs Salem notes, this is a Q&A site, not a complaint department for Canonical.

(Blue strikeout text is text I deleted and the other user didn't accept yet)\nThis is a key feature for me. I need to edit a .tex file this way, can be with Sublime, Gedit, Geany, Kile, etc. I prefer Gedit, Geany or Kile although any plain text editor that has this feature will be welcome. If this feature simply doesn't exist in plain text editors then I can edit the .tex files through LibreOffice, but I don't want to do it.\n\nA: You should try Gobby.

If you find your driver, download it and install it just like any program.\n\nA: You seem to have both NIC and wireless card of broadcom and they are sometimes nasty. Your lsmod says wl module is loaded which is proprietary driver and should have worked. But wl has issues so what I would recommend is you try sudo apt-get install --reinstall dkms bcmwl-kernel-source and see in the terminal if you get any errors. Also try b43 driver which is an alternative for your wireless chip. \nUNFORTUNATELY, these all require you to be online, so you may need to download these packages and do local install.

I put the dongles on my PC and both are recognized and setup correctly.\nI've used first one or second one separated having success, but if I try to connect both, strange thing happen. When I connect the second interface, the first are disconnected and all USB devices are bloqued, inclusive the keyboard and mouse. Apparently the OS restarts all USB devices... I can't understand if this is true and for what reason it's occurs...\nPlease, If someone can help me, I really appreciate... I can send logs, version, etc, but I don't know at this moment what information is relevant to get the diagnostics.\nThanks! \n\nA: I'm not an expert, but are both from the same Manufacturer? check the prod ID etc via lsusb. If two usb dev have same ID then that might mess up the mounting system tree. Instead of two dongles use one via tethering to a portable device. This will express in Linux as \"usb0\" so it might work that way.\nAlso, what you are trying to do, which I also would like to achieve, is called \"bonding\" see wikipedia page here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation.\nProblem with dongles per se is that they use PPP as the protocol which is verrry goofy in that the link can \"go down\" w/o warning or detection and come up again (cell phone companies). This is very difficult to bypass using the bond protocols which assume at the least a steady link.\nNonetheless, there's a co called teradek (http://www.dvc.uk.com/acatalog/BOND.html)  in UK which sells a GBP2,000 (!) \"box\" which allows you to connect multiple dongles to stream live video out of Syria for example! Yes, i know, too expensive unless some news channel handles your expenses.\nPls  update me someone if htis can be done in s/w on my Tux box?\nEDIT:\nActually I came to this below solution backwards: There is a company called \"Connectify\" and they sell s/w for $100 for windoze which has prob reverse engineered a standard linux solution of \"bonding\" module in the kernel!! they claim in their advertising how \"hard\" it is in linux: ie. load kernel module enable script etc.\nso reverse engineering connectify's statement I stumbled on following procedure\ninstall ifenslave:\nsudo apt-get install ifenslave\nthen \nmodprobe bonding\nifconfig bond0 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0\nifenslave bond0 eth0 ppp0 usb0 \nifconfig bond0 up\nin addition to implementing straight \"bonding\" above, you can install a local reverse proxy like HAProxy, so apparently there are MANY MANY ways to do Link Aggregation in Linux only we have to learn about it.\n", "Q: problem running a command with incron I try to print some ODT documents from LibreOffice 4 (Ubuntu 13.04 OS) to a Toshiba e-Studio 167 printer.

I have been using Ubuntu 13.04 for last 2 months. It was working properly but suddenly the Ubuntu Software Center has started hanging. Now it doesn't open. And every time I try to open it, I have to force quit it. So that I am not able to install the software that I need. What do I do?\n\nA: Make sure software-center is not running.\nFirst make sure the Software Center (process name software-center) is not running. Depending on how you've been forcing it to quit, a software-center process may or may not still be running in the background.\nIf you know how to make sure a process isn't running, you can skip the rest of this section.\nYou can use the GNOME System Monitor for this (type system monitor in the Unity dash and an icon for GNOME System Monitor will appear).\nOr you can use killall from the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nkillall software-center\n\nRun it again and you should get:\nsoftware-center: no process found\n\nIf you don't see that, it's still running. In that case, run:\nkillall -KILL software-center\n\n(Running that again will, in the same way, determine if it succeeeded)\nThe Software Center is not ordinarily run as root: instead, it uses polkit to perform specific actions as root.

I'm looking for Systems Dynamics software (e.g. Stella) for Ubuntu, preferably open source. Recommendations for non packaged software that runs on Linux are also welcome.\nThanks.\n\nA: The answer to this question appear to be no. These past few days I found several free or open System Dynamics programmes that should run on Ubuntu, but none is packaged at this time; some of them are just code libraries. Here's the list:\n\n\n*\n\n*DynSim - a Java package, apparently undocumented.\n\n*MapSim - a simulation engine for System Dynamics. Provides a .NET library that works on Windows and under Mono on Linux plus a simple GUI tool. MapSim uses its own modelling language described in a reference manual. \n\n*NetLogo - the famous agent based modelling framework; supports system dynamics models as a secondary feature.\n\n*Sphinx SD Tools - a project dedicated to create a common accessible environment for System Dynamics simulation. It is developed on the Java 6 platform and uses the Java Swing GUI.\n\n*SystemDynamics - a graphical Java application for modelling, visualisation and execution of System Dynamics models.\n\n*Simile - A proprietary System Dynamics and object-based modelling and simulation software package similar to Stella, Model Maker, Vensim, etc. A free evaluation version, which limits the size of saved models, is available.\n\nA: There are a couple of Python script library that may be of interest for Linux/Ubuntu users.

This is more flexible than the BIOS approach, but it creates the possibility of mis-matches between what's on the hard disk and what's registered with the firmware. You can usually do the registration in Linux with the efibootmgr utility. Your Boot Repair output shows that GRUB is not properly registered (lines 934-945 and 983-994). This suggests that efibootmgr might not be working on your computer; however, it can't hurt to try using it manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Linux using your workaround method.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -c -p 2 -l \"\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\" -L \"GRUB (Ubuntu)\". Be very careful in typing that command. Note details like the use of quotes and backslashes. (If you want to eventually re-enable Secure Boot, substitute shimx64.efi for grubx64.efi in this command.)\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -v to check your entry. Verify that the filename is entered correctly.\n\n*Reboot. Ideally, GRUB should appear as the default boot program.\n\n\nIf GRUB does not appear, then use your workaround method to boot to Linux and type sudo efibootmgr -v again. If the entry for GRUB is present, then scrutinize it again for typos, and check the BootOrder line to see if it's listed as the first entry. You might need to re-type the command to correct a typo or use the -o option to efibootmgr to adjust the boot order.\nIf the GRUB entry has disappeared, you might try using bcdedit in Windows to fix the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Windows using your workaround method.\n\n*Open an Administrator Command Prompt window.\n\n*Type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi.\n\n*Reboot. With any luck, GRUB will appear.\n\n\nThis method sometimes works when efibootmgr fails, so it's worth trying.\nIf that fails, too, try running Boot Repair again, but this time, click the Advanced options button and select the option to back up/rename the Windows boot loader and put GRUB in its place. (I don't recall the exact wording of this option.) This implements an ugly hack that installs GRUB in place of the Windows boot loader and moves the Windows boot loader to a new location. This workaround can easily cause future problems, but it (or something similar done manually) is the only way to get some systems working. In fact, some HPs are known to require this solution, so you may well need to use it. Alternatively, you could return your computer to the store and buy one without a broken firmware. If you do this, be sure you tell HP why you did so; it's only returns (and the costs they impose on manufacturers) that will communicate to them that they should stop selling junk.\n", "Q: Wrong locale alpha-numeric display in spite of locale settings?

Ideally, I was thinking I could do something like this.\n/mnt/usb/clang code.c -o code\n\nA: Sure it possible.  Your biggest problem will probably be getting the package to install where you wnat it to.  Once on the usb, you should 1)ensure the mount of the usb does NOT have the \"noexe\" option, 2)tweak your PATH  environment variable to include the usb directory containing the executable, and 3)Add any necessary environment variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH to allow the linker to pick up any needed libraries.\n", "Q: How to copy files from multiple directories? I have a bunch of text files in several directories I want to copy into another.\nWhat can I do, instead of going inside each directory and cp *.txt in this directory? \n\nA: If none of the answers in the related threads is what you're looking for, you could consider using the find command, which will search directories recursively downwards from a given parent. You can specify an exec action to perform on each of the matching files that it finds - in this case, you'd want it to perform a cp to a new target directory\nfind /path/to/parent -name '*.txt' -exec cp -t /path/to/newdir {} +\n\nThe {} is replaced by the files that it locates, and the + at the end causes it to batch them so as not to overflow the maximum number of arguments that cp can handle in one command. The newdir must already exist.\nSince you are moving files from many places to one place, there is a possibility that some names will be non-unique, and so you may want to take care to prevent an earlier copy from being overwritten by a later copy - you can do that by adding a backup option\nfind /path/to/parent -name '*.txt' -exec cp --backup=numbered -t /path/to/newdir {} +\n\nwhich will add a simple numbered suffix to each duplicate file. You can add a -v or --verbose flag to the cp if you want to see a running report of the files as it copies them.\n", "Q: Can't move/resize windows with Logitech wireless mouse connected (Precise) On 12.04 Precise, when I connect a Logitech wireless mouse (M305), I'm no longer able to drag windows around via their title bar or resize them.

OS X includes tools for managing boot loaders on a Mac that are more-or-less necessary for managing the boot process in EFI mode. Once you've re-installed OS X, you can install rEFInd or use bless to register GRUB as a valid boot loader.\nIf you want the computer to be a Linux-only system, I have two suggestions; try whichever sounds best to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager and write it to a USB flash drive. Try booting Linux using that. If it works, copy the entire contents of the USB flash drive to your /dev/sda1 EFI System Partition (ESP) and see if you can boot without the flash drive. If this works, leave it that way.\n\n*Use gdisk (in the gdisk package) to convert the partition table from GPT to MBR: Type sudo gdisk /dev/sda, then type r to enter the recovery & transformation menu, then type g to convert to MBR and answer the prompts. When you're done, reboot into an emergency system and re-install GRUB. This process will convert the system to boot in BIOS mode rather than in EFI mode. A Linux-only install on a Mac is likely to be easier to manage in BIOS mode than in EFI mode.\n\n", "Q: how to get rid of dual booting and only use ubuntu I just installed Ubuntu from Wubi and it automatically made it dual boot but I want it to only boot from Ubuntu.

More specifically, why does libslack's daemon consider files that are being executed in a group writable directory to be \"unsafe\"? If you can give me an explanation of why group writable directories are considered unsafe in just a general sense that would be nice too.\nSorry, apparently this was too unclear. In libslack's daemon man page it states:\n\n-U, --unsafe\nAllow reading an unsafe configuration file and execution of an unsafe executable. A configuration file or executable is unsafe if it is group or world writable or is in a directory that is group or world writable (following symbolic links). If an executable is a script interpreted by another executable, then it is considered unsafe if the interpreter is unsafe. If the interpreter is /usr/bin/env (with an argument that is a command name to be searched for in $PATH), then that command must be safe. By default, daemon(1) will refuse to read an unsafe configuration file or to execute an unsafe executable when run by root. This option overrides that behaviour and hence should never be used.\n\nAt the end it states that this option (the unsafe option) should never be used apparently/assumably due to security concerns.\nI personally can't really seem to think of what would be so inherently unsafe about daemonizing something that resides within a group writable directory.\nI don't see why my question was put on hold either because it seems like a rather straight-forward question to me for anyone that actually read it but here is an attempt to write it out more clearly.\nWhy is it considered unsafe for a file to have a directory in its path that is group writable?\nFor me this is more specifically in regards to libslack's daemon but I have seen multiple other packages flag the same scenario as unsafe as well, so if you could provide me with some information as to what type of security issues I could expect due to me running--despite the warning--daemon with the unsafe flag, that would be wonderful.\n\nA: From the manual of sendmail/Majordomo:\n\n2.4.1. Consequences of Unsafe Group Writes\nIf a user has write permission to access an aliases file, she should be a trusted user. By putting an entry into the aliases file (such as the one used to execute wrapper) a user can execute any program with the privileges of Sendmail (daemon or, in older versions, root). This gaffe would allow people to remove or change the permissions of files that belong to daemon (using the rm or chmod commands in the aliases file). To some extent, this possibility is avoided by using smrsh; however, one must still be careful as to what files are in the /etc/smrsh/ directory.\nAnother important security issue is that the user who can access the aliases file can append or write to files that belong to daemon by using file redirection (a >> or > instead of a |). Even so, this breach too can be countered by adding a line to the sendmail.cf file limiting what files can be written to through the aliases file.\n\n<..>\n\nIn the case of include or .forward files, commands or redirections are run as the user who owns the file. Therefore, if a file is group writable, a member of the group can execute commands as the user who owns the file. In other words, any user in the group could execute commands as that user. However, since the user is created without a shell, commands or redirections will not be processed in include files owned by that user.\n4.2. Consequences of Unsafe Group Writable Directory Paths\nIf a user has group write permission to a directory, for example /etc/, the user could simply move any file and create a new one in its place. An attack might go something like this\n\n[user@system etc]$ mv aliases ...\n[user@system etc]$ vi aliases\n\n\nThe user can then make her own aliases! This attack, however, could be prevented by Sendmail's security checking for unsafe group writable paths. Such an attack also would work with include and .forward files having unsafe paths.\n\nSource.\nThis manual explains it pretty well and the same logic applies to many other pieces of software: mind that you are using a multi-user system even though you might be the sole user of that system. And on a multi-user system a user needs to be protected from other users.\n", "Q: command line, no desktop environment I have installed an ubuntu in a computer with windows, but when i open the computer with ubuntu, there's no desktop environment, only a command line.\nI've even written my username and password on command line but it's still just a command line.\nExtra info: when i choose \"try ubuntu\" with usb booting, there is no desktop neither.

Here I am asking how you would go around installing ubuntu on pre-installed Windows 8 as I have NOT  installed anything yet. In the \"Answered question\" the asker is asking about Wubi on windows 8 preinstalled, AFTER he tried installing it. Please read both questions before flagging this down.\n\nA: The Windows boot manager can not boot Linux by itself. In fact, I know of no way to chainload from the menu of the Windows boot manager to a Linux EFI-mode boot loader. First, though, you should be aware of the distinction between two types of software:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot managers are programs that give the user a choice of what OS to boot, typically through a menu.\n\n*Boot loaders are programs that load an OS kernel, and often related files, into memory and transfer control to the kernel.\n\n\nIn the Linux world, most BIOS boot managers are also boot loaders. GRUB, for instance, provides both types of functionality. Thus, Linux users tend not to distinguish between these two types of programs. In the EFI world, though, some products fall neatly into one category but not the other. The EFI stub loader, SYSLINUX, and ELILO are all boot loaders but not boot managers (except to the extent that the latter two can give you a menu of options of Linux kernels to boot; but they can't boot anything else). rEFIt, rEFInd, and gummiboot are all boot managers but not boot loaders. GRUB can handle both tasks.\nThis distinction can get a bit blurry because of the EFI stub loader, which is an EFI boot loader that can be built into a Linux kernel, meaning that the kernel becomes its own boot loader. The result is that boot manager configuration starts to look a lot like boot loader configuration.\nIn any event, a boot loader is mandatory for loading an OS. My knowledge of the Windows boot manager is a bit scant, but I don't know of a way to configure it to present a menu for chainloading to another OS (at least on EFI systems), so as far as I know, it's more of a boot loader than a boot manager, hence its lack of utility for your purpose.\nOn an EFI system, GRUB does not replace any Windows boot loader; it installs itself in addition to the Windows boot loader. Thus, the risks of using GRUB are pretty limited, provided you're careful not to totally erase the EFI System Partition (ESP). In a worst-case scenario, you can delete the GRUB files and the computer will begin booting straight to Windows. For added safety, back up the ESP before you begin installing Linux; that way, if you accidentally wipe it out, you can restore its files to get back to your starting point. A file-level backup (using tar, zip, cp, or the like) is fine for this, since EFI doesn't rely on hidden boot code stuffed away in boot sectors.\nAs I've indicated, there are several alternatives to GRUB if you don't like it. My Managing EFI Boot Loaders for Linux page describes the boot loaders and boot managers you might want to consider. Personally, I like the combination of rEFInd with the EFI stub loader; but as I maintain rEFInd, I'm not exactly unbiased.\n", "Q: Thunderbird's Indicator Doesn't Show the Bubbles in 13.04 I have tried the solutions that I found here.

I installed the Ubuntu SDK using the instructions on http://developer.ubuntu.com, so I really have no idea what's wrong.\n\nA: I was able to reproduce this by following the Get Started instructions and testing with the Ubuntu Weather App. There must be either an error in the instructions or a bug in the Ubuntu SDK packages.\nThis seems to work as a temporary workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look up the name of your Qt installation:\n$ qtchooser -list-versions\nqt5-x86_64-linux-gnu\n\n\n*Specify the name using when running qmlscene, which is just a symlink to Qt  Chooser:\n$ qmlscene -qt=qt5-x86_64-linux-gnu ubuntu-weather-app.qml\n\n\n\nA: While the above answer is correct in one sense, it's an indication the 'default' configuration has not been installed or is not reachable. qmlscene should work without specifying -qt= option.\nThe qtchooser listing should show the following on Ubuntu 13.04 for example:\n$ qtchooser -list-versions\nqt5-x86_64-linux-gnu\ndefault\nqt5\n\nThe following commands should make sure you are up-to-date:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk \n\nIf those do not help to give the above qtchooser listing, additional debugging would be needed. Above all, the 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' was previously lacking in the official instructions at http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/ which may have caused problems for Ubuntu 13.04 users.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit - GeForce GT 620 card is not working, always going to minimum graphics mode I have GeForce GT 620 card connected in a Dell PC (Alienware x51) brand new.

My Acer C7 is running Chrubuntu. After I bought an 8GB ram extension, Minecraft is still running with only 5-9 fps. My system shows 9.4 Gigs of ram running, but this still makes no difference to Minecraft. I allocated more memory to Minecraft but this still didn’t make any changes to the lag. Why is this?\n\nA: I suspect the combination of low-powered CPU and graphics is causing the framerate issue, rather than RAM.\nAdding extra RAM would help in situations where the machine is running out of memory. If it isn't, extra RAM will make zero difference to in-game performance.\nOne test would be to run top in a console while running Minecraft. If the CPU is hitting maximum (100% for single-core CPU, 200% for dual-core, etc), the CPU is probably causing (or contributing) to the low frame rate.\nAs far as I know the CPU in a C7 is going to be soldered onto the motherboard. Upgrade options are extremely limited (unless, as the commenters in that Tom's Hardware thread say, you're handy with a soldering iron).\nUnfortunately, it's just not a gaming machine.\n", "Q: Software Raid0 doesn't mount successfully in fstab I have created a Raid0 and it works as I expect it. The the array file is created at /dev/md0. I want this to be mounted automatically by adding this line at the end of the /etc/fstab file :\n/dev/md0 /mnt/storage ext4 noatime,commit=60,data=writeback,nodiratime,journal_async_commit,nouser_xattr 0 0\n\nand this Line at the end of the /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf:\nARRAY /dev/md0 metadata=1.2 name=lil-RIKO:lil-RIKO UUID=6016d5e4:6e42cb97:6b2a8e6e:098c1982\n\nIn Boot time, I saw that /mnt/storage was being waited to be mounted and provide two options : to Skip ... or to Ma... I forgot what its says. I waited so long that made think something is wrong. I went into the \"maintenance mode\" which is a root shell then I quickly checked presence of /dev/md0 file. The File wasn't there, only /dev/md127. I tried to mount that file instead and it complained about not finding a superblock. I manually mounted the raid via mdadm --assemble /md0after removing the /dev/md127 file via mdadm --stop /dev/md*  and I continued booting. Next reboot, I experienced the same issue.\nHow come the raid wasn't get automatically mounted? There was no presence of /dev/md0 at boot time and I was able to mount it manually.\nEDIT1: I have managed to \"merge\" it into one which is /dev/md127 by removing a disk , The problem still occurs but when I issue ths cat /proc/mdstat I got this:\nmd127 : inactive sdc[1](S) sdb[0](S)\n      7830528 blocks super 1.2\n\nThis means (I think ) the raid is not yet activated. But when I reattached it it comes active like this:\nmd127 : active raid0 sdc1[1] sdb1[0]\n      7830528 blocks super 1.2 512k chunks\n\nWhat went wrong this time ?\n\nA: Did you remember to run update-initramfs after assembling the array as md0? if not, try stopping and re-assembling the array again and then doing so, i.e.\nsudo mdadm --stop /dev/md127\nsudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md0\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nThis should make the initial root filesystem 'aware' of the array at boot time\n\nA: Hopefully you already found an answer; if not, I just went through this, and the short answer is to edit your array definitions at /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf; basically remove anything other than the /dev/md* and UUID= info (delete metadata, name, etc).  On reboot, you should no longer have the md127, md126, etc problem with your arrays.\nSo based on your line above, change\nARRAY /dev/md0 metadata=1.2 name=lil-RIKO:lil-RIKO UUID=6016d5e4:6e42cb97:6b2a8e6e\n\nto\nARRAY /dev/md0 UUID=6016d5e4:6e42cb97:6b2a8e6e\n\n\nA: I encountered a similar problem,  mounting the md0 array in fstab fails with 'serious error encountered attempting to mount /mnt/md0' (or similar).  Frigged around with this for an hour, couldn't get it to work. Checked UUID, /proc/mdstat, mdadm.conf etc, all seems ok.\nAdded nobootwait option to fstab so it doens't lock up the boot process (headless server)\nLooks like a race condition to me, because issuing the mount command manually after boot works fine.\nWorkaround that works for me:\nedit rc.local, add following line before exit 0\nsleep 10 && mount -t auto /dev/md0 /mnt/md0\nSideeffect is that the mount appears 10 seconds later, but I can live with that.  Without the sleep command, it didn't work.\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Upgrading from 10.10 to 12.04 I'm not versed in Linux, but my father-in-law gave me Ubuntu 10.10 on a USB, because my Hardrive had failed and I put in a new one. I ran Ubuntu from the USB for a while and decided that I would give it a try and installed it onto my brand new empty hardrive. I now see that I really need to upgrade to a newer version. I thought that I could use the Update Manager and just work my way up the version, but upgrading to 11.04 fails with the message \"Failed to fetch, this may be a network problem\". \nI can download 12.04 and 13.04, but all I get are .iso files. What do I do with them? \nRunning Wubi.exe doesn't work. I've searched here and can't seem to find an answer which addresses my issue, or at least one written in a way I can understand. Please bear with my inexperience with Linux.  \nUPDATE:\nSo with further research I have found this:\nAs a release gets old (especially if it is not a LTS release), it becomes no longer   hosted at archive.ubuntu.com. However, the repository is still hosted at\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com\nSo try changing your repository source to http://old-releases.ubuntu.com.\nThis is great, but I'm now having difficulty finding somewhere that describes \"Changing your repository\" for a layman. I have found these:\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine\nBut I can't seem to follow how to add the \"old releases\" url to the repository.\n\nA: First off, download an ISO file from ubuntu.com: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nAll things considered, you might want to get the LTS version (12.04), as it's the most stable. If you want the latest version, go for 13.04.\nThen, you can create a bootable USB from Windows, using this application:\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nI've used it many times, and never gave me any troubles (well, except that one time... I just created it again and worked like a charm.)\nOr, you could create the USB from your existing Ubuntu installation: Run the Startup Disk Creator (Applications > System > Startup Disk Creator in 13.04, but it's supposed to be available in 10.10. The command is usb-creator-gtk. You can run it by pressing Alt+F2)\nThere you'll be able to select your pendrive, the ISO, and the app will create a bootable USB for you to install Ubuntu with.\n", "Q: Web search shortcuts using keywords in Gnome Web Does Gnome Web browser support the keyword search functionality of Firefox?\nSo, I define ggi as search google images and type ggi ubuntu in the address-bar to get the image search results?\n\nA: It has mechanism that I think is superior.  You don't use keywords, you just define search sites and they appear as options when you type in the location box.\nTo set one up, go to the website you want to add and do a search.  Use a term you can easily spot later (like \"dummy\").  Bookmark the site, and if you have a category called \"Quick Searches\" add it to that.  If not, create such a category and add it.\nFinally, edit the bookmark by replacing \"dummy\" with \"%s\" (no quotes) in the search query.  That will be the part of the URL following the \"?\".  There may well be lots of junk there, but you should find your search string somewhere.  You might also want edit the title, since many search sites add the term to the title of the returned page.\nUPDATE: The manual for Epiphany does not say that the bookmarks need to be in any particular category, and that checks out, despite the manual obviously being rather out of date otherwise.  (For example, in 3.6.1 there is no \"Show in Toolbar\" option).\n", "Q: File permissions won't change sorry fresh user. I installed about 9 days ago and had issues with Unity disappearing which took 5 days of headaches to fix. It never did fix, I reinstalled. \nI set up Plex (media server) and while the server is running and can be accessed by external network devices, I can't add files. Plex says this is because of permissions. I have gone up and down the forums here and at Plex to get an answer. It seems everyone says \nchmod -R 755 /media/My\\ Book/Videos\n\nwill change permissions to allow the folder \"Videos\" on my external USB 2.0 NTFS 3TB Western Digital drive (which is mounted and accessible through the file manager) as well as every sub-directory and file contained therein to be accessible to user \"Plex\".\nI have used file manager and as soon as you click to change permissions it changes right back. When I chmod with -c it tells me every file is changed (usually 600) to 755 as I commanded it to do. I did \nls -l\n\nto verify and there is no change. (I also used ls -l to make sure I knew who the owner was and it is me (mvl1014). ls -al gives me the same info.)\nI swear to god I tried to sudo it and after smashing my head against this keyboard for basically the entirety of my day, I tried it as root. I was scared shi-less but couldn't come up with anything else. sudo su to root and then chmod -R -c /media/My\\ Book/Videos\nSame result. -c told me every single file was changed and a check in Unity or in terminal confirmed not a darn thing changed.\nNow it seems to me that even if that isn't the thing stopping Plex from working there is still a problem with this command not going through.\n12.04LTS -- on gen 1 i7 (2.7 GHz I believe) with 6 GB ram \nI've attempted to attach a screenshot but I'm told I need 10 reps to do so, which means I'm copy/pasting too.\nPlease excuse my obfuscation, but Lorem Ipsum seemed unnecessary.

How do I change this?\nThanks.\n\nA: The 2nd column (the number '1' in your case) is how many hard links point to that file or directory\n\nThe second column is the number of links to the file i.e., (more or less) the number of names there are for the file. Generally an ordinary file will only have one link, but a directory will have more, because you can refer to it as 'dirname' or 'dirname/.' where the dot means 'current directory', and if it has a subdirectory named 'subdir', you can also say 'dirname/subdir/..' (the '..' means 'parent directory').\n\nsource of the above, also see this answer\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a SecureBoot machine with no existing OS I was given some bad(malicious) advice, and my entire OS was deleted.

If user2 makes a folder, and I (user1) try to add something to it, it says you don't have permission, but user2 can drop all the stuff he wants into it.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Thats the dealing with the permission the user2 set. The folder was created by user2 so the rightful owner of that folder is user2 only.unless he gave the permissions to you , you can not view that.\nhow can you access it ??\nwell you can access that in two ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are the root /admin user then you can directly access the folder by using your root power.\n\n*ask him for the permissions.\nThere are no other ways legally.\nUpdate\nOP as you mentioned , If something there to deal with SAMBA , then you must look over /etc/samba/smb.conf\nfor example: \n[music]\npath = /home/shared/music\n\nfor that shared file If you made the permissions as\n\n\n*\n\n*read only = Yes  # only read only\n\n*create mask = 0775  # this is the mask value as root can do anything , but users and others can read and execute can not write.\n\n*writeable = Yes  # giving write permissions. \n\n\nSo everything to deal with sharing will be at samba configuration file.

I know Byobu is a terminal multiplexer and mouse is not a priority, but I still would like to know if there is a way to focus on a split using mouse click instead of keyboard shortcuts.\nIn negative case, it certainly would be a great feature.\n\nA: Yes, this is very much possible.\nYou simply need to turn on mouse support in your ~/.byobu/.tmux.conf configuration.\nAdd the following:\nset -g mouse-select-pane on\nset -g mouse-select-window on\nset -g mouse-resize-pane on\nset -g mouse-utf8 on\n\nThis will allow you to:\n\n*\n\n*select a split by clicking in it\n\n*select a window by clicking on it in your status bar\n\n*resize a split by grabbing the border and dragging\n\nHowever, you may now find it difficult to use your mouse to click on some text, and highlight (select) it.  To do this, you'll now need to use either Shift-LeftClick or Ctrl-LeftClick.\nFull disclosure: I am the author and maintainer of Byobu.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04 this solution no longer works. It seems that config has changed in tmux new version (from tmux 2.1 and up).\nNow you must copy (append) the following in your ~/.byobu/.tmux.conf file:\nset -g mouse on\nset -g mouse-utf8 on\n\n\nA: for me, neither of the above solutions seemed to do anything.\nRestarting the terminal session, and restarting byobu with those settings in the config file did nothing. \nOne magic keypress changed all that:\nCtrl+F12 and you get the message \"Mouse: ON\"\n(Ubuntu 18.04, tmux 2.6, byobu 5.125)\n\nA: Other option would be to change it in the Ctrl-a-C (Caps C), and enable mouse in the session options:\n\nNOTE: this will only enable the mouse for the current session.\n", "Q: What is the command line statement for changing the System clock? Is there such command for changing the System clock's date and time?\nFor example:\nThe current date and time is January 1, 1970 22:30:59:980 where 59 and 980 refers to the seconds and millisecods respectively\nAnd I want to change it to January 2, 1971 23:31:59:990\nIs there a command for this?\n\nA: To set the time in Ubuntu from the terminal, you can use the following command:\nsudo date new_date_time_string\nwhere new_date_time_string has to follow the format MMDDhhmmyyyy.ss which is described below:\n\n*\n\n*MM is a two digit month, between 01 to 12\n\n*DD is a two digit day, between 01 and 31, with the regular rules for days according to month and year applying\n\n*hh is two digit hour, using the 24-hour period so it is between 00 and 23\n\n*mm is two digit minute, between 00 and 59\n\n*yyyy is the year; it can be two digit or four digit\n\n*ss is two digit seconds. Notice the period . before the ss.\n\nSource: Manage Time in Ubuntu Through Command Line.\nSo, in your particular case, you can use:\nsudo date 010224311971.59\n\nOr, you can use:\nsudo date --set=\"1971-01-02 23:31:59.990\"  && date --rfc-3339=ns\n\nwhich is exactly what you asked.\nSource:\n\n*\n\n*How do I set current Unix time in milliseconds?\n\nA: You can use the date command to change the time and you'll need sudo permission to do it; an example to set the date to 27 June 2014 and the time to 1:17 AM is:\nsudo date --set \"27 Jun 2014 1:17:00\"\n\n\nA: Since systemd was introducted in Ubuntu, the correct way is:\n# timedatectl set-time \"RFC 3339-compliant string\"\n\ne.g.\n# timedatectl set-time \"2002-10-02T10:00:00-05:00\"\n# timedatectl set-time \"10:35\"\n# timedatectl set-time \"+2 hours\"\n\n\nA: The easy way:\nntpdate -s ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nTo change the timezone:\ndpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\nProbably you need sudo.\n\nA: Short versions for setting date or time only:\nTo set the date (will set the time to 0:0:0):\ndate +%Y%m%d -s \"19710102\"\n\nTo set the time only:\ndate +%T -s \"23:31:59\"\n\nYou could add the desired \".990\" to the seconds.\nRead the man page for more options and formats regarding the date command:\nman date\n\nNote: you may also want to check or set the hardware clock.

With gnome-disk-utility alias palimpsest there is an option to format entire disk with partitioning scheme \"none\" or something similar.\nHow do I do that in gparted?\n(? is it the \"loop\" option ?)\nOr does it not have that feature?\n\nA: How to remove all partitions using GParted\nWarning: This will not remove the data from the disk. After doing this, data will still be recoverable.  But it does remove the partition information so the entire disk is available for new partitions\nIf you want to delete the system partition (with / on) you'll need to start GParted from a live cd (\"try ubuntu\" mode)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install GParted with sudo apt-get install gparted and start it\n\n*Select the correct device (physical hard drive) in the right upper corner (make sure to wipe the hard drive, and not your USB stick)\n\n\n*Click(in the top menu) on Device > Create Partition Table\n\n*Select MSDos or GPT and click apply (you might get a warning about not being able to inform the kernel)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: First part of the answer:  gparted can be used to remove the partitions of a drive so it may be reused.\nSecond part of the answer:  No, gparted does not actually wipe the partitions in a secure way so the data is non-recoverable.  \nIt is a trivial process to use gparted to select the partitions and tell gparted to delete them.\nIf you want to actually wipe the disk in such a way that the data is unrecoverable, follow the instructions found at the accepted answer here:\nHow can I securely erase a hard drive?\nEXCERPT:\nsudo shred -v /dev/sdX\n\nshred will overwrite the data areas with random information so the original files and directories are not recoverable.  \nIt does take some time to complete this command, so be patient.\n\nA: gparted as a live CD, includes the tool nwipe, which you can use to securely wipe a disk.\nOnce booted into gparted fire up the Terminal, and start nwipe for example:\nnwipe /dev/sda \n\nwhere sda is the device node ID of the disk you want to wipe.\nThe default destruction method is \"3 pass\" (or \"dodshort\") but other ways are available with --method switch:\ndod522022m / dod       - 7 pass DOD 5220.22-M method\ndodshort / dod3pass    - 3 pass DOD method\ngutmann                - Peter Gutmann's Algorithm\nops2                   - RCMP TSSIT OPS-II\nrandom / prng / stream - PRNG Stream\nzero / quick           - Overwrite with zeros\none                    - Overwrite with ones (0xFF)\n\n\nA: The first two answers do not actually wipe the disk. \nFormatting or re-writing the partition table, as suggested in the first 2 answers, does NOT delete the data and the data can be recovered in about 20 minutes.\nThis is because deleting and recreating partition table does not delete data at all. You can recover data even after quick format of partition. It is not a rocket science - even simplest file recovery utilities will recover this data.\nAlthough gparted can re-format the drive, gparted will not wipe the data.\nIn order to wipe the data you need to write data to the disk. This can be done with a variety of tools from dd to dban to a number of command line tools.\nSee Securely erase hard drive using the Disk Utility for details.\n\nA: Yes it is very easy to do so in Gparted. Actually I found Gparted as the most user friendly tool to create/delete/format partitions.\nWarning: This will not remove the data from the disk. After doing this, data will still be recoverable.

The problem was really with the device driver I had chosen in Additional Drivers as the image shows in the question. I then selected the second choise in wireless drivers which is \"Do not use this device\". It doesn't have the meaning it implies, it only does avoid using broadcom wireless STA driver.

It may thus be possible that a socket is hanging and holding up the final cleanup (including removing the lock file)??\nWhat can I do about this? Can I set a longer timeout for mongodb to shutdown? Can I insist that mongodb be allowed to die cleanly before ssh tunnels are killed? Is there another explanation that I'm missing??\n\nA: Indeed, there is a limit on the time that services are allowed to take to shut down. Ubuntu uses upstart to start and stop services, and upstart's default limit for that is 5 seconds (see the upstart documentation on kill timeout). Possibly it will solve your problem if you increase that timeout. You have to place the kill timeout directive mentioned in the link in the upstart configuration file for mongodb. On Ubuntu 12.04, this file is found at /etc/init/mongodb.conf. You can find an upstart file that contains the kill timeout directive in the current mongodb source. (However, this file may not work on your Ubuntu system due to different paths.) \nI had the same problem on Ubuntu 12.04 even without replication, and for me kill timeout 300 fixed the problem. \n", "Q: VPN connection successfully established, but IP address does not change I have set up an OpenVPN connection via the network manager on Ubuntu 12.04 following these instructions:\nhttps://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#ubuntu_openvpn_installer\nInitially I could not access any websites when connecting to the VPN network. \nI then ticked the box for 'Use this connection only for resources on its network' under IPv4 Settings, Routes.\nAfter ticking the box everything seemed to work.

So when typing history at the terminal gives me all the commands I have entered before, indexed to a number. Is there any way I could just call the number associated with the command?\n\nA: Using the key combination Ctrl+R, you will be able to use keywords to search your Bash history.\nA quick bash key binding reference can be found here: http://ss64.com/bash/syntax-keyboard.html\n\nA: If you've found the history number of a command and you want to execute it again, type ! followed by the number, e.g. !1234 and press Enter. This is part of history expansion; you can tack modifiers onto it.\nIf you want to edit the command before running it, fc 1234 invokes an external editor.\nBut as Terry Wang already mentioned there are usually faster ways of locating a command in the history than determining its history number, including Ctrl+R to invoke incremental search (press Enter when you've found the command you want to execute), or fc PREFIX to execute the previous command beginning with PREFIX.\n\nA: The bash history can do many helpful things, and the search with Strg-r that Terry Wang mentioned is an important one among them. But it is also possible to do exactly what you asked for.\nYou can re-do the previous command with !!. With this, you can also edit the previous command. If for example you forgot to get root privileges for a command\napt-get install a-long-list-of-packages\n\nyou don't have to retype all of that again. Instead just call\nsudo !!\n\nIf you want to re-execute the command at a specific position from your history, you can also use !, for example\n!3\n\nto re-execute the command at position 3. Be aware that this counts from the top. So if you're storing 500 commands in your history, !1 would be \"500 commands ago\". You can also use negative numbers. For example\n!-2\n\nwould re-execute the second last command.\nYou can also re-execute the last command that started with a string like\n!apt-\n\nwhich would re-do the last line that started with \"apt-\". If you want the last command where the string appeared anywhere in the line, you can use something like\n!?pt-ge\n\nThere are more interesting things the bash history can do. Just to give an impression of the wide range of possibilities, you can specifically access a parameter of a command from history. So\n!-5:3:p\n\nwould print the third parameter to the fifth from last command.\nEDIT: Regarding Rudie's comment below, with the standard settings this bash history expansions are indeed executed directly. It's probably best described like this: A call like !-3 is replaced by the shell with the third last command from your history and then your input (with the replacement) executed. So if you type !-3 and press ENTER and your third last command was ls ~, it's in effect the same as if you typed ls ~ again and pressed ENTER \"on your own\".\nIf you don't want that, you can set the shell option histverify. For setting and unsetting shell options, you might want to read up on the shopt command. With histverify set, a call like !-3 only writes the replacement from your history to your command line, but doesn't execute it directly. You have, so to speek, press the crucial ENTER yourself - or refrain from it, if you choose to.\n\nA: Yes, there is. If, for example, you want to execute the command that has number 1234 next to it, do:\n!1234\nOther useful stuff:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to run the last command you ran, do:\n!!\n\n\n*If you want to run the last ls command you ran, do:\n!ls\n\n\n*If you just ran ls /some/long/path, and you want to cd to it, do:\ncd !$\n\nFor more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*How To Use Bash History to Improve Your Command-Line Productivity\n\nA: The history command will show all commands and their associated numbers. If you want to just do a quick check before executing command line # 135 you can type:\necho !135\n\nThis will show you what is going to be executed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu files are not accessible through Windows 8 I have installed Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit alongside genuine Windows 8. \nI can access both through Grub boot menu (Though the Windows 8 is shown as 'Windows 8 UEFI recovery'), but the problem is, when I save something in Ubuntu on a drive, I can't find the file after booting in to Windows 8. \nThe problem is worst when I try to access the F drive from Windows 8 it shows \"F:\\ is not accessible. The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable\". This drive is NOT the drive where Ubuntu was installed.\nWhat should I do now?\n\nA: By default, you will not be able to access Ubuntu's partitions from Windows because GNU/Linux uses the ext4 file system, which Windows does not understand. If you would like to access these files from Windows, there are a number of utilities which tell Windows how to deal with the ext file system family. Take a look at this page for some solutions.\nThis is one way of interpreting at your question. However, after reading your question again, it sounds like what you are trying to ask is this:\n\"When I use Ubuntu to save a file onto a file system Windows should understand, Windows cannot read this file. Help!\"\nI can't really answer this question, but I dimly remember experiencing a similar problem, and I think I solved the problem by using a different flash drive. Re-formatting the drive might also help.\n\nA: As Josh mentioned above, Windows cannot understand how the read the Ext4 filesystem, which Ubuntu uses. (Ubuntu does not have the problem the other way around).\nIf you must share files, I would suggest one of 2 ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the windows directory and write into the directory (eg the My Documents directory).\n\n*Create a new partition of type NTFS and write into that.\n\n\nThere is also software that you can install on Window to read the Ubuntu partition, but I cannot comment in how reliable that is.\n", "Q: How can I fix ubuntu winboot wubildr.mbr missing error? I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bit) operating system. It supports uefi so I installed it like a normal dual booting now (not like Wubi).\nWhen I try to load Windows 8 it works fine. But when I try to run Ubuntu, I get the following error:\nubuntu winboot wubildr.mbr missing\n\nHow to fix the Ubuntu boot-loading issue?\nUPDATE: I have tried bootinfoscript on my lap and this is the URL: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6073509/\n\nA: The error message suggests a WUBI installation. Your computer, though, is clearly booting Windows in EFI mode, and WUBI is incompatible with EFI. Therefore, if you did a WUBI installation, it won't work.\nThere's also evidence on your computer of a standard partitioned installation of Linux: You've got a separate /dev/sda8 that uses a Linux ext4 filesystem and that seems to have boot files; and you've got a BIOS-mode GRUB in the disk's MBR.\nOverall, therefore, my guess is that you've tried both installation methods, either intentionally or not. If so, one thing you should do is to remove the WUBI stuff. I'm not an expert on WUBI, so I'll just leave it with that link. Removing WUBI won't solve your basic problem, though; the point is to not waste disk space and to simplify the configuration so you're less likely to get confused in the future.\nAssuming your Linux installation on /dev/sda8 is more-or-less complete, you're faced with the problem that you've got a mixed-mode installation -- Windows is booting in EFI mode, whereas Linux is set up to boot in BIOS mode. This can be awkward at best, so you should probably convert Linux to boot in EFI mode. You can do this in many ways, but either of the following is likely to be easiest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a live CD-R or USB flash drive in EFI mode and run Boot Repair. This should get GRUB up and running with Windows detected. The trick is forcing an EFI-mode boot of a live CD. You may need to play with your firmware's boot options. Typically, hitting a function key (which one varies) produces a boot menu, and you should select the one for your live CD that mentions \"EFI\" or \"UEFI.\"\n\n*Download the CD-R or USB flash drive image of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a medium with it. You should then be able to boot to it. If rEFInd lets you boot both Windows and Linux, boot to Linux, mount your EFI System Partition (ESP; your /dev/sda3) to /boot/efi, and install the Debian-package version of rEFInd. You'll then use rEFInd to select your OS on subsequent boots.\n\n\nIf one of these fails, try the other one.\n", "Q: Compressing folders with password via command line I would like to know whether it is possible to do the following via CLI.\nI have a Folder F which contains several sub folders and some files. I want to compress folder F into .zip file with the \"password-only-extract\".\n\nA: The encryption of zip files is weak and can be broken very easily. Instead use 7zip.\n7z a -p Fdirectory.7z /path/to/F\n\n\n\n*\n\n*a command tells 7zip to add files.\n\n*-p You can either, leave it blank so it asks you interactively or type your password here.\n\n*Fdirectory.7z is the name of the to-be-created archive.\n\n*/path/to/F is the path of your directory. It can be relative or full path.\n\n\nIs recommendable not typing the password in the shell since it's visible to anyone with access to the /proc directory.\n\nA: Go to the relevant folder using the cd command like this:\ncd /path/to/folder/\n\n(If your folder F is in your Home folder, you can just do cd ~.)\nThen, type in your terminal:\nzip -er F.zip F\n\nThis will prompt you for a password. Give it, and that will create a password-protected zip file from that folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*-e enables encryption for your zip file. This is what makes it ask for the password.\n\n*-r makes the command recursive, meaning that all the files inside the folder will be added to the zip file.\n\n*F.zip is the name of the output file.\n\n*F is the folder you want to zip.\n\n\nThere is an option called -P that will allow you to pass the password in the command itself, but that is not good because there is always the threat of over-the-shoulder peeking. Also other users can see the password by using ps -ef command if you use -P switch. With that -P switch, the command will look like this:\nzip -P password -r F.zip F\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit man zip for more information.\n\n", "Q: Chromium is having difficulties in showing some web pages I'm experiencing some problems using Chromium on Ubuntu : while Firefox works perfectly, Chromium will...

But I think you have to enable the auto-import feature for this to work.  Look in the Preferences, under \"Library Location\" there's also a check box that needs to be checked: \"Watch library directory for new files\".\nCurrently these photos are still in the database (hence the \"duplicate\" that does not allow it to re-import) but the file location has changed so they go \"missing\" under Shotwell.

Now I'm working on trial version of ubuntu, using install usb drive.\nI don't know how to change the size of the partitions now, but beside that I'm not sure if this would be the solution since I'm not sure if the partition is really full - during the installation, I've made this partition much bigger that it was said in the tutorial and I don't have any special applications (ubuntu, latex, some other small stuff).\nIn \"proprieties\" of the system partition is said that total capacity is 15,1 GB and 15,1 GB is used.

Still I don't understand why my system takes so much space. I'm hesitating a bit with \"scary\" suggestion of mikewather, but maybe I'll have to take a risk :) Or is there anything else I could do, less \"scary \"?\nUPDATE:\nI'm reopening the question since the problem persist. Last time, when I managed to boot my computer, I've made / bigger, but now I have once again full system partition, I don't know why. I wanted to reinstall the system (there are some problems that I don't know how to \"divide\" in separate questions and I need my computer working quickly). I've downloaded the .iso file for Ubuntu 14.04 - and the system partition got full again. I thought since it's not installation but download, it should be on /home and not /, so why there is no more space after downloading it? And why 25 GB is not enough for /? I didn't install any important things since that time.\nIn any case I'd like to re-install the system, but I'd like to know why it's happening to avoid the same mistake during the new installation.\nAccording to the replies to that question, my root partition is huge and I didn't install anything important since one year (since the time I changed it's size from 15 to 25 GB).\nThanks\n\nA: You can solve your issue using Recovery Mode\nOnly thing you have to do is to remove some junked files/folders from /dev/sda1 i,e where you have installed Ubuntu\nFollow these simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your system and chose Recovery Mode (Safe Mode) 2nd option in Grub Menu.\n\n*Select grub option from the list (chose yes for the question)\n\n*Then go to root in order to login as root\n\n*Then execute these commands in series in order to free some spaces..\n# apt-get autoclean\n# apt-get autoremove\n# apt-get clean\n\napt-get clean will remove packages that left after installing any package. So don't worry for that..\n\n*Then go to your Your Home directory and remove following directories ( I'm assuming that your Ubuntu's User name is 'maria`):\n# cd /home/maria\n# rm -r .config .local .cache .fontconfig\n\nAbove command will remove only your Users settings and Web history that you surfed using any web browser. So don't worry for that.. Your system will become new.\n\n*Then reboot your system:\n# reboot\n\nHope after rebooting your problem would be solved. Reply for further assistance..\n\nA: Other answers have some good suggestions. But you also need to see why you used so much. If you have not installed a lot of very large applications you should not have used that much space.  A 15GB root, while not generous is large enough for most users. I actually use about 7GB with a fair number of apps installed.\nSometimes a running system has errors and keeps posting into log file and log files then fill system. I would check that.\nIf you can boot after minor houseclean:\ncd /var/log\n\nreview for very large file & remove log files if no issues\nsudo rm -f messages.*\nsudo rm -v /var/log/*.gz\n\nLots more details:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoverLostDiskSpace\nOtherwise you need to review if you have some very large files. \n\nA: You could try the recovery mode, and the following two commands to free some space:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\ndpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d' | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\nThe first one deletes cached installation files, and should free a few hundred MB. The second (long and scary) removes all unused kernels and headers.\n", "Q: How can I get my recognized Ricoh SD Card reader working on 14.04?

That tree should be reserved for software installed by your package manager (Ubuntu Software Center, apt, etc). There is usr/local/share for that. Or, if you don't want to use sudo, you may install for your user only at ~/.local/share. See https://askubuntu.com/a/135679/11015 for more information about software install directories.\n\n*If you want to execute a .desktop file by double-clicking on it, in Nautilus or your Desktop, just make the .desktop file executable! Note that this is not required if you copy it to /usr/share/applications and launch it via Dash/Menu. Or, better: copy to ~/.local/share/applications or at least /usr/local/share/applications, as suggested above.\n\n*Icon=/usr/share/MyApp/MyApp.py makes no sense: a .py file is not a valid image, so it cannot be used as an icon. If you want to use the default python icon, use /usr/share/pixmaps/python.xpm\n\n*The main difference between your .desktop file and the accepted answer is the Path=/usr/share/MyApp/ statement. If that made your app work, it means your software requires the current directory to be the application directory. And that is a bad thing: your software should be able to run fine and find its data files regardless of current directory. (hint: use python's __file__)\n\n*If your application is a GUI (ie, it has a window), then add StartupNotify=true. It will help the launcher identify its window when it is running.\n\nA: I think you should move your Python file to /usr/local/bin or /bin\nand remove the .py at the end and add #!/bin/python3 to first line of your python file then copy you icon to /usr/share/pixmaps\nand add this in the .desktop file\nExec=<your file name which is in bin>\nIcon=<your logo name without .png or xpm at back>\n\n", "Q: How to protect an NTFS external drive to be use both in Ubuntu and Windows?

Another\n  possible reason that Tor cannot start is because there is already\n  another Tor process running. Check your list of running process and\n  stop the previous Tor process, if you find one. Then, try running Tor\n  again. \nIf that did not help, check your message log to see if Tor printed any\n  information about errors it encountered while trying to start. \nVidalia Can't Connect to Tor\nVidalia manages Tor by communicating with it via Tor's control port. \nThe most common reason that Vidalia cannot connect to Tor is because\n  Tor started, but encountered an error and exited immediately. You\n  should check your message log to see if Tor reported any errors while\n  it started. \nIf Tor is listening on a different port than Vidalia expects, Vidalia\n  will be unable to connect to Tor. You rarely need to change this\n  setting, but if there is another service running on your machine that\n  conflicts with Tor's control port, you will need to specify a\n  different port. You can change this setting in Vidalia's advanced\n  configuration settings. \nTor Exited Unexpectedly\nIf Tor exits immediately after trying to start, you most likely have\n  another Tor process already running. Check the message log to see if\n  any of the last few messages in the list are highlighted in yellow and\n  contain a message similar to the following: \nconnection_create_listener(): Could not bind to 127.0.0.1:9050: Address already in use. \nIs Tor already running?\n\nIf you find an error message like the one above, you will need to stop\n  the other Tor process before starting a new one with Vidalia. On\n  Windows, you would need to look for tor.exe in your Task Manager. On\n  most other operating systems, the ps command can help you find the\n  other Tor process. \nIf Tor had been running successfully for awhile (that is, longer than\n  a few seconds), then you should check the message log for information\n  about any errors Tor experienced before it exited.

My reason is that I was testing the hard drives closed together on a closed case. This made one of the HDD fail the Airflow Temperature reading.\nAfter opening the case up (Which lowered the Temp of all drives 10 degrees Celsius in 5 minutes) and then separating the drives a bit more (3 less degrees) All results were good but since the Airflow reading failed in a previous reading, it always shows as failing.\nSo how can I reset the readings for SMART?\n\n\nA: The point of current / worst attributes like temperature is exactly this: to tell you if the drive has ever been outside its max operating temperature, and thus might have suffered permanent damage.\nThat's why it says \"failed in the past\", not \"failing now\": you did just barely touch the max-temp threshold.  Note the attribute display shows \"normalized: 50, threshold: 45, worst: 45\".  (These are 0..200 normalized values like for any other attribute, not raw Celsius temps.)\nYou also have some bad sectors (uncorrectable sector errors), so whether the brief high temperature caused that or not, it's probably time to ditch that drive.\nA better SMART software UI would show you the current and max-ever temp.  e.g.\nsmartctl -a /dev/sda or smartctl -x /dev/sda (-x prints all available SMART and non-SMART data it can get from the drive, including a temperature history log if the drive has one, with an ASCII bar graph.)\nsmartctl -x includes this for an old WD Green 1TB (WD10EADS) hard drive:\nCurrent Temperature:                    36 Celsius\nPower Cycle Min/Max Temperature:     25/42 Celsius\nLifetime    Min/Max Temperature:     35/46 Celsius\n\nThe software you're using looks like it's only showing the current temp, which is slightly below the threshold, but it's not going to hide the fact that the drive was out-of-spec at some point in the past.\n\nYou could certainly justify ignoring that momentary high-temperature, if you really did correct it in minutes.  But you won't (or shouldn't) ever be able to make the drive itself lie about the fact that it was over its rated max temp for some time, and thus the attribute did fail in the past.\nYou can configure smartd to ignore any given attribute so you can still get a useful notification if anything else crosses a threshold into officially-failing territory.:  smartd.conf(5) says:\n\n-i ID  [ATA only] Ignore device Attribute number ID when checking for failure of Usage Attributes.  ID must be a decimal\n  integer  in  the  range\n                from 1 to 255.  This Directive modifies the behavior of the '-f' Directive and has no effect without it.\nThis  is  useful,  for example, if you have a very old disk and don't want to keep getting messages about the\n  hours-on-lifetime Attribute\n    (usually Attribute 9) failing.

Presumably if you were going to modify the SMART data, you'd just have done that and removed any mention of it being out-of-range ever, but obviously you can't 100% trust any data from a 2nd-hand drive that someone's trying to sell you.\nSee https://superuser.com/questions/1389522/what-does-it-mean-when-my-new-hdd-reports-errors-at-a-time-that-shouldnt-exist for more about used drives with \"odometer rollback\" on their \"Power_On_Hours\" attribute for example.\n\nA: Actually there is a way to reset S.M.A.R.T. data. You only need simple rs232 to usb converter (uart to ttl) and a few cables attached to hdds diagnostic interfaces. (it's on the right side of sata port, 5 or 4 pins) You must conect RX TX and GND cables (and power cable of course :D) then power on HDD and connect to it with putty or hyperterminal (linux can connect with it's own terminal i guess)\nfor example for seagate drives:\nfor 7200.10 and older baud rate is 9600\nfor 7200.11 and newer is 38400\ncommands\nafter connection hit CTRL + Z\nthen type \"/1\" hit enter\ntype \"N1\" hit enter\nwhen it finishes remove all cables and turn on HDD like normal to see changes :)\nfor other hdd info use google :)\n\nA: SMART data is not very standard between manufacturers, but the Hard Drive Temperature test should indicate if the drive's temperature has gone over a threshold in the past: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.#Known_ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes\nThe thinking is that an overheat increases your chances for failure. SMART isn't saying your drive is bad, but has an increased chance for failure in the future.\nSMART is meant to be an audit of the drives history and is maintained by the drive itself, so you cannot \"reset\" or \"clear\" SMART values.\n\nA: Hard drives have spare space for recovery reasons.  The recovery happens automatically.  Recovery tools only remap physically bad sectors to this spare space. Once remapped, when a read or write occur to a bad sector, the drive turns the access to the spare space, and hides the error.\nTo be honest I don't know of a way to reset SMART data. It's something that the hard drive maintains internally, and in any event it would be a bad thing to do.\nSMART reports that your hard drive is failing! Resetting the counters will not change the fact that an error threshold for the drive has been exceeded.\nSo NO, you can't Reset S.M.A.R.T. history. It's installed at the factory for drive evaluation upon failure.  SMART can only be disabled or enabled.\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nA: HOW TO RESET SMART in drives\nWith specific Data Recovery machinery like Acelab, Atola, DFL, MRT, you can reset SMART tables and logs.\nNo sense in doing that though,\nunless you aren't doing some low level data recovery task which does require this reset.\nResetting SMARTs is like think to remove the cast in the leg of a leg broken two days ago. You repaired nothing ... you simply hide a HUGE problem.\nThe leg is still broken and \"using it\" will cause pain and further additional damages ... exactly like loosing forever your precious data\nHDDs with any kind of bad SMART, including temperature, are drives which\n\n*\n\n*are seriously in trouble\n\n*have worked in really worse conditions\n\nin either the cases you are simply trying to kill yourself data leaving them on such problematic drive.\nSMART as the acronym says, is the self monitoring system of the self drive healthiness.\nOne day it tells you the drive is going to die. The job is done, the drive should (must) be replaced.\nAt that point you have a blinking ringing HUGE WARNING ... now what? It is in your decisions.\nABOUT SMART REALLOCATED SECTORS\nas written in a comment I have written in this thread,\nSMART reallocated sectors count has nothing to do with G-List (firmware specific) in drives.\nG-List is the reallocation map of hard drives and every manufacturer has its own G-List format.\nIt is a built-in mechanism in the drive's firmware, when a remap in the G-List happen, this is REGISTERED in the SMART table for reallocation counts.\nSMART reallocated sectors and even worse pending sectors are simply registered in the SMART tables, they are simply part of the mechanism that makes the SMART predictive failure to work.\nNote: It works as warning in the BIOS at boot or only if you have a daemon or a utility that do monitor the SMART status and warns you of eventual issues.\nIn fact it makes no difference that you have a (roughly) 1 billion sectors 500GB hdd or a 4 billions sectors 2TB, the SMART reallocation table has only 200 or 250 sectors.\n... 200/250 , sometime 100, aren't they too few for so many billions of LBAs ?\nSo I would make a modification to the accepted reply since it makes to think that you can repair a failed drive ... the drive is FAILED you CAN'T FIX IT ,\ninstead\nyou must take the SMART warning for what it is ... and replace the drive\nMany of the unrecoverable drives that we receive, have been KILLED by such utilities mostly for the simple reason that a failing drive, needing to be kept TURNED OFF, has been massacred by an absolutely USELESS repair (killing) process\nRobert\nCTO @ https://www.recuperodati299euro.it\n\nA: A stupid thing about SMART is that it permanently stores one time transient things that did no damage at all. I had a drive that recorded a power failure in its SMART and forever after the computer would warn about the SMART data indicating \"impending drive failure\" simply because of a power outage caused by someone driving into a power pole. No idea why that specific power failure got recorded by SMART when I've had many computers and many drives experience power failures without recording them as an \"error\".\nI had another drive I picked up used that had a SMART record of very briefly exceeding max temp by one degree thousands of runtime hours previously.\nIf SMART was really \"SMART\" it would not allow such transient \"errors\" to trigger the BIOS warning or OS X's refusal to install on drives that have any SMART \"errors\" at all recorded.\nIf there's real damage to a drive, it should quickly show up again in SMART after being cleared, just like problems do in vehicles with OBD2 and CAN systems.\n\nA: To my knowledge, the only way to stop it is to turn off SMART in the BIOS.  This will only stop the HARDWARE, though.  \nYour OS will still query the drive for its SMART info and tell you it's failing.  \n", "Q: Installing NCTUNS in Ubuntu 13.10 I am not able to find the NCTUNS tool in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nHow to install the NCTUNS on the Ubuntu 13.10?\n\nA: The NCTUns is a network simulator and emulator. Each version adheres to only a selected GNU/Linux distribution of fedora (The latest NCTUns 6.0 adhering to fedora 12). \n", "Q: Fixed wireless then bluetooth stopped working I've tried doing a recovery, deleted unnecessary packages. I'm a bit baffled because after updating the kernel to include the new Intel 7260 driver (to get the wifi working) Bluetooth worked a few times and then stopped after restarting to update system packages.\nNow the options to add a Bluetooth device have disappeared and only shows \"Bluetooth: Off\" and \"Turn On Bluetooth\" and \"Bluetooth Settings\"\nIt seems that maybe I changed something when updated and restarted the system, but I'm not sure what? I've run sudo apt-get update followed by a sudo apt-get upgrade, seems that no packages are needed for download.\nI've included some diagnostics below. If anyone could refer me to another similar solution online (I've been looking for a while, this seems to be very similar to my situation and hasn't received a response: Bluetooth adapter turned from working fine to unrecognized)\nScreenshows of what I see:\n\nand\n\nlsusb\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp. \nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:07dc Intel Corp. \nBus 002 Device 003: ID

I just did an install of the hp laserjet P1102w printer and it's not working. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, and I went to see if I had hplip installed and it said I did.\nHow do I set up this printer?\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 13.10 and tried to use my HP LaseJet P1102w but it wouldn't respond to the printing requests, neither with Wi-Fi or USB cable connected. Ubuntu 13.10 already comes with this printer pre-configured with default settings. You should be able to just choose it on a list and use, with no need to \"add a new printer\".\nHowever, for me the default setting (HPLIP libary and driver 'hpcups 3.13.9') didn't work. When you send a request to the printer, the LED blinks but nothing else happends. Switching to the alternative driver 'Foomatic/foo2zjs-z2', already included with Ubuntu 13.10, solved the problem. Now it works via Wi-Fi or USB cable.\nIn case you don't know how to, or don't want to, change the default instalation, you can add a new printer following this step-by-step:\n1) Turn on you printer\n2) Go to 'System Settings' and 'Printers'\n3) Choose 'Add printer'\n4) Select your printer on the list of Wi-Fi printers brodcasting on your area (Network printers). If you prefer to connect to the printer via USB, just connect the cable, prior to this step, and choose the printer shown to be connected via cable, shown on the top of the instalation window.\n5) Choose the 'HPLIP' option that will show up on the right frame.\n6) Enter the names you want to use to identify it and click OK, to finish. Your printer should have been added now to the list of installed printers.\n7) Double-click on you printer icon, to go to the properties.\n8) Click on 'Change' at 'Make and Model'.\n9) Choose 'HP' on the list of manufacturers.\n10) Choose model 'LaserJet Pro P1102w' and the only driver that will show up  (Foomatic/foo2zjs-z2). If you choose the recommended model 'LaserJet Professional P1102w' the driver option that will show up is 'hpcups 3.13.9', which, at least for me, didn't work out. Click next.\n11) I recommend to choose 'new PPD', although the re-use of an older PPD can also be used. Click Apply.\n12) Your printer should be responding properly now.\nIf it works for you or not, leave a feedback and/or rate this question/answer to help the Ubuntu Community to improve the system!\nCheers!\n\nA: I did the following under 14.04: check at hplipopensource.com the Basic HPLIP Troubleshooting steps.\nIn my case the missing PPD could be easly installed via entering \"hp-setup\" in a terminal window. Just follow the instruction, ensure that printer is connected to the WiFi, PPD will be downloaded from HP and printer is installed and working fine.  \n", "Q: I have a ThinkPad T60 with Ubuntu 13.04 and WIFI is inoperable--anyone know how to get it working?

It seems that it is not more or less secure then the original implementation.

A drawback for this extension is the missing license which makes it no FOSS.\n\n*is the same as 2., Mozilla just localize their websites\n\n*Is just a packaged version of 1.\n\n*A new competitor seems to be this \"GNOME Keyring Integration\"-Add-On.

I have a machine that came with 12.04 LTS pre-installed. After working seamlessly, it sat unused for a bit and now will not boot properly. I've searched for fixes, but none has worked.

I won't end up with two partitions, one with the old broken OS and one with the newly installed one, will I?\nPlease use as simple as language as possible when answering.\n\nA: What would you want to happen.\nThe installation will provide you with a few options - one of them to re-install, the other to use existing space and install there. Of course, you can always choose the custom way of doing things your own way, but there is a risk is you are not sure how to handle the partitions.\nThe re-install will remove and overwrite your partitions, along with any data you have on them, so tread carefully there.

My laptop got broken recently (I had Ubuntu on it), and I've backups of my files on external HDD. The problem is that my new laptop has Windows 8 on it and I don't feel like switching to Ubuntu on it just yet. Is there a way to restore my precious audio and video files to my new computer (all backup files are on GPG-format)?\n\nA: Yes. Déjà-Dup is a graphical front-end to Duplicity (Wikipedia page), a command-line backup program. You can run Duplicity on Windows using Cygwin, and restore the files from the command line.\nSetting up Duplicity on Windows may be somewhat involved. This guy has some instructions; you may be able to skip setting up some of the dependencies (pexpect, SSH) which are needed for making remote backups.\nIf I recall correctly, the command to restore is\nduplicity restore file:///path/to/backup /path/to/restore/to\n\nYou can then access the restored files in that directory.\nIf you're not familiar with the command line, it would be easier to boot the computer off a live CD, and use duplicity or Déjà-Dup from Linux to restore the files onto your Windows partition.\n", "Q: Install software without root access? Is it possible to give a user the rights to install software, without giving him other sudo-rights?\nLet's say I were to install Ubuntu on the student's computers at a school. I would like them to be able to install software from the software center, but not to do anything else to the system.\n\nA: As per the link that @tom has pointed out above, it is certainly possible to do so, but this is a bad idea.\nThere are countless exploits that could be performed with access to apt + dpkg, here's one off of the top of my head:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a simple deb package with a special install script that simply adds a particular user to the admin groups and/or changes the root password.\n\n*Install the package using sudo dpkg -i or the Software Center.\n\n*You now have root-level permissions to the system.\nAnother possibility would be users installing potentially hazardous software on the computer and/or removing important things, esp:\n\n\n*\n\n**libc* (Most programs use many, many c calls)\n\n*linux*(No kernel = nothing to boot)\n\n*grub* (No bootloader = no booting into kernel)\n\n** My favorite - PURGE ALL INSTALLED PACKAGES\nA better idea that might work out for you would be to have an install queue that users can recommend packages to, which a sysadmin checks every now and then and installs where necessary. Installing across multiple machines could be done in a variety of ways. Here's one easy way to install across selective groups of machines:\n\n\n*\n\n*Host additional packages on a repo on a server within your control within your network.\n\n*Make sure that the repo is setup on all computers within the building.\n\n*Setup a cronjob that runs every 15 or so minutes to install all upgrades (sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y upgrade)\n\n*On the repo-server, if you want a group of computers to have a given package, update the package for that group of computers so that the package you want installed is a dependency of the computer-group-package.\n\n*If the package you want to install (and/or its dependencies) are not available from the main repos, add them to the repo-server.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: No more authentication methods to try.

So new connections did not work, but current connections stay alive.\nI do suggest that you always keep the pubkey and privkey together in somewhere, so, you can compare and even reload. Another thing is, try to do a ssh connection to guarantee that it is not a fingerprint issue. \nIn both cases -v, -vv and -debug for sshfs may be useful. Also, in the host machine, use journalctl -f while trying to connect, it will show the attempt (if it happen) so you be sure that the connection is not blocked too...\n", "Q: Intel 2200BG Wireless Card unable to establish WEP connection with router I've just starting using Ubuntu & completed a clean install of Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS on a Compaq nc6230 laptop with an Intel PRO/ Wireless 2200BG wireless card. After the installation, I can't connect my nc6230 (Laptop 1) to my home Wifi router (Linksys WAG200G) using WEP encryption.\nI encountered the WEP connection problem immediately after the initial OS installation.\nHere's a summary of the symptoms I'd encountered:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can enable the Wifi card by pressing the Wifi Quick Launch Button.\n\n*Network Manager can detect & list the AP (same AP I connect to with another laptop).\n\n*Network Manager shows it's trying to connect to the AP (blinking icon in system tray).\n\n*On the nc6230 (Laptop 1), Network Manager will keep prompting me to key in the WEP password every few minutes.\n\n*I'd deleted the old Wifi connection in Network Manager and create a brand-new connection.

Windows 8 is definitely installed in EFI mode, and I boot ubuntu from my flash drive in EFI mode. I have been looking at the page explaining UEFI (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI) but it is all very confusing to me, as I am inexperienced with these things. I know how to partition my hard drive and everything, but according to the page, if I have windows 8 partitioned in an EFI partition, I can install ubuntu into the same partition and it will be installed in EFI mode? Excuse me if I'm wrong, but is this true? I cannot afford to mess up my laptop, as I only saved up enough money to buy 1. So can anyone offer me a simple, step by step explanation on how I can install ubuntu to dual-boot with pre-installed EFI windows 8 successfully? All I have seen is a \"Figure it out yourself\" and \"Poke around in BIOS\" tutorials with just snips of information.\nThank you, and I will appreciate any help I can get.\n-Ben\n\nA: To put it simply, the only major difference between installing ubuntu in UEFI mode and normal mode is the installation of grub in the GPT partition (grub-gpt instead of grub-bios). \nPlease refer to the following documentation and especially the part about how booting your Ubuntu CD in EFI mode and how to tell if it was done properly:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nI'd highly recommend creating recovery media for your Windows 8 installation (which is normally done through a pre-installed tool on your Windows installation that comes with your laptop) plus copy or move your files/documents/videos/music/data to a USB or some other external media. And also I'd like to point to the fact that even if something goes wrong your laptop's hardware shouldn't be damaged and as long as you have the recovery disks on hand you can always go back to where you were before (as long as you didn't have any non-backed-up files on your disk).\nI've done the above successfully with Ubuntu 13.04 and Linux Mint 15 and 14 before that. \n", "Q: Unable to repair boot with Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 I have a Samsung laptop NP350E7C.

I repaired windows and now there is not way to reboot on Ubuntu. I even tried to use windows' boot manager instead of GRUB2 with no success.\nI then followed the instructions at http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/uefi?redirect=1 (disabled fastboot and secureboot in the BIOS) and re-installed ubuntu.

Then have restart and try again.\n\nA: It is a bug, this is a partial workaround.\nTo workaround quit out using the launcher (or just closing the window) and relaunch leaving the indicator in the top menu running) even with the desktop file below results seem inconsistent and buggy.\n\nCreate a new launcher that has StartupWMClass=Spotify defined.\nYou can make a spotify.desktop file with these contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Spotify\nGenericName=Music Player\nComment=Listen to music using Spotify\nIcon=spotify-client\nExec=spotify %U\nTryExec=spotify\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Qt;Audio;Music;Player;AudioVideo\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/spotify\nStartupWMClass=Spotify\n\nOr edit the orginal from /opt/spotify/spotify-client/spotify.desktop (requires superuser permissions) adding the line StartupWMClass=Spotify at the end\nSave it somewhere you can keep it like \"Documents\". Then drag it to the launcher.\nThis will make sure that the windows with the WMClass named spotify will open under that icon.\nCode to get WMClass of a window:\nxprop|grep WM_CLASS\n\nThis returns the following when clicking on the spotify window:\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"spotify\", \"Spotify\"\n\n(This seems to only partially solve the issue, completely exiting will probably end up with two icons again)\nNote: I noticed that the problem started happening less and less the more I launched it - this is probally due to my system having preload installed, it might help:\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/preload/\n\nA: You can avoid the bug if you first click Hide Spotify (in the system tray icon) before exiting Spotify completely.\n", "Q: How to make vm boot from live cd I have created a vm for ubuntu 13.04 and configured it to boot from live CD (I want to try Fedora on it), but it doesn't boot. It displays a shell terminal I think and this is it.\n\nA: Run Oracle VM Virtualbox, select the virtual machine (if you have more than one) and open Settings.\nUnder the System portion of Settings you will see the Boot order, as in the below screenshot:\n\nIf you want to boot from an .ISO file, pause the VM on startup with Host+P (Host key is Right Ctrl by default) and browse for the file on Devices > CD/DVD Devices > Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file. Then resume it again by the same key combination. It will boot from the ISO file.\n\nA: The method in AliNa answer if you have VirtualBox, but if you have VMWare Workstation, right click on the VM, choose Power, and then Power On to BIOS.  Once you get the BIOS screen, go to the Boot Tab, and change the Boot order, save and exit.\n\n\n\nA: Adding one more method for those of us configuring VMs on headless servers.\nYou'll need to know your storage controller's name and the port index of the dvd drive (usually 0). You can get that info from showvminfo. \nvboxmanage storageattach MyVm --storagectl MyVm_sata --port 0 --type dvddrive --medium ubuntu-18.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso\n\nLaunch the VM and then attach to it with an RDP client. If you do not have VRDP enabled you can do so with: \nvboxmanage modifyvm MyVm --vrde on --vrdeport 5001\n\nWhen you're done, remove the medium:\nvboxmanage storageattach MyVm --storagectl MyVm_sata --port 0 --type dvddrive --medium none\n\n", "Q: Wifi drivers wont function I've been trying to get my WiFi drivers on my laptop working for a week or so now and every video and thread has not helped me out.

I am downloading the 64 bit version, but the tar file is labeled amd64.tar.xz...will this work on mhy intel 64 system, or should I just use the 32bit version?\n\nA: amd64 is equivalent to x86_64, is the 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set. Intel called it Intel64 initially.\nDifferent distros use different naming, a bit confusing but in fact they are the same thing. Debian uses amd64 (that's why Ubuntu uses the same) while Fedora, Arch Linux use x86_64. Don't worry;-)\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation on disk already dual boot formatted I have an older Toshiba laptop (about 6 years old) formatted for SUSE 11.2 and Windows XP for dual boot.  I want to reformat the hard drive and to install Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS as the sole operating system.  I have an open USB port.  I can also use a USB flash drive to load the Ubuntu installation files to either current hard disk partition.  I can also use a portable hard disk as the source for installation files.  Finally, I could make a DVD which I think the laptop could read.  (It will certainly read CDs, but I'm not totally sure about DVDs.)\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: I have a Dell Latitude D610 laptop that is old, and what worked for me was a disc. I downloaded the 32 bit ubuntu from the ubuntu website, and then I burned it to a blank 700mb disc. You want to make shore that the boot sequence is set to boot from cd. After this it is pretty self explaining.\nTake care...\n\nA: First of all, you need to download the ISO file from the Ubuntu website. If you are not sure if your drive will read DVD, make a bootable USB to install Ubuntu – the ISO image won’t fit in a CD.\nTo make a bootable USB you can follow the instructions for Windows here, or use Netbootin on Linux (I’m not sure about OpenSUSE repositories). If you had another Ubuntu system near you, it would be just easy for you with Ubuntu pre-installed Startup Disk Creator.\nIn the installation process, select Something Else. \nI recommend you to have a separate home partition, so delete all partitions except the SWAP, then make an at least 15-20GB one for ext4 File System and select / for its mount point. The rest can be your home partition, so format it to ext4 and select /home for its mount point.\nThat’s it! Now you can click on the install button.\n", "Q: Printer Samsung ML-2165W: Installed but it won't print (13.04) I couldn't make printer Samsung ML-2165W work for Ubuntu 13.04. I had general Linux driver from Samsung installed. The installation was successful, printer didn't print a test page.\n\nA: The same issue here, although I got it running under ubuntu 12.04 LTS with linux drivers from Samsung. With 13.04, however, Samsung drivers are not installing properly any more. As a workaround, you could try Samsung driver packages from the http://bchemnet.com/suldr/ repository (look at the suld-drivers-4.00.39 package specifically).\n\nA: this is instructions for wifi setup on 64bit, based on these full instructions:\n sudo useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash --groups lp samsung\n xhost +local:samsung #as a X app will be run\n sudo su - samsung\n wget http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/DR/201110/20111019151150392/PSU_1.01.tar.gz\n tar xzf PSU_1.01.tar.gz\n cd cdroot/Linux/wirelesssetup\n\n ldd bin64/wirelesssetup  | grep 'not found' #if it outputs something...\n # apply these fixes (find these files with `mc` and create these proper symlinks to them as shown below)\n #tar -xf libstdc++-5-x86_64.tar.gz \n ln -s libnetsnmp.so.10.0.2 libnetsnmp.so.10\n ln -s libqt-mt.so.3.0.5 libqt-mt.so.3\n ln -s libqui.so.1.0.0 libqui.so.1\n\n export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"`pwd`/../psu/share/lib64/\"\n bin64/wirelesssetup /dev/usb/lp0 #the application will open on X\n\n sudo passwd -d samsung\n passwd samsung #create a proper password if you want to keep that user or\n sudo userdel --remove samsung #delete it\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu vs lubuntu for desktop? Are the UI and speed of operation the only differences ? I want to know if the functionality is the same or not.\nThanks.\n\nA: What do you mean of functionality?\nLubuntu is an Ubuntu OS with the same repository sources, but with a different desktop environment and set of default applications (packages).\nIn the matter of desktop, you can also install LXDE and its components on Ubuntu either to try it beside Gnome Shell (Unity on 17.04 and below).\n", "Q: How to check for errors in RAM via Ubuntu? I have Ubuntu 11 running off a 3.6GB USB flash/stick drive. System has 4GB RAM and blank hard disk (wiped using DBAN tool).\nHow do I check if there are no errors in my RAM? Is there a guaranteed way to check that via some Linux command? If not, it would be great to know why.\n\nA: By installing the memtester package, you can check your system for errors while it's still running. No need for a restart, just run that application.\nTo install it, open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt install memtester\n\nYou can then use it like so:\nsudo memtester 1024 5\n\nThis should allocate 1024MB of memory, and repeat the test 5 times.\nUpdate\n\n*\n\n*If you have more RAM like 4GB or 8GB, it is up to you how much memory you want to allocate for testing.\n\n*As your operating system, current running process might take some amount of RAM, Please check available free RAM and assign that too memtester.\n\n*If you are using a 32 Bit System, you can't test more than 4 GB even though you have more RAM (32 bit systems doesn't support more than 3.5 GB RAM).\n\n*If your system is very busy and you still assigned higher than available amount of RAM, then the test might get your system into a deadlock, and leads to system to halt, be aware of this.\n\n*Run the memtester as root user, so that memtester process can malloc the memory, once its gets hold on that memory it will try to apply lock. if specified memory is not available, it will try to reduce required RAM automatically and try to lock it with mlock.\n\n*If you run it as a regular user, it can't auto reduce the required amount of RAM, so it can't lock it, it tries to get hold on that specified memory and starts exhausting all system resources.\n\n\nA: The Ubuntu Live CD includes a tool called Memtest86+ that will do just that—test your computer’s RAM.  Boot up from the Ubuntu LiveCD, press and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the GRUB menu. Select Memory Test\n\n\nA: I have found mprime to be a good tool to test memory:\nftp://mersenne.org/gimps/ \n(mprime can also be used to stress test your CPU)\nAlternatively, use the package stress-ng to run all kind of stress tests (including memory test) on your machine.\n\nA: No need for Memtest86+:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your computer: reboot.\n\n\n*At the GRUB boot screen (with UEFI, press Esc).\n\n\n*For 4 passes add temporarily  the memtest=4 kernel parameter.\n\nmemtest=        [KNL,X86,ARM,PPC,RISCV] Enable memtest\n                Format: <integer>\n                default : 0 <disable>\n                Specifies the number of memtest passes to be\n                performed.

I can't for the life of me figure out where to find the Software Center... I know you can run it from the terminal but I'd rather do it visually. This is in Ubuntu 12.04.3.\n\nA: The Software Center is not in the cog menu on the right side of the top panel.\nIt may be in the Unity launcher already. That's the vertical bar of icons on the left side of the screen.\nIf not, click the home button (Ubuntu logo at the top of the launcher) or press Super (i.e., Windows), and start typing software center in the textbox until the Software Center appears as a search result. Then click on it to run it.\nAlternatively, press Alt+F2 and type software-center (just as you would do if you were running it from the Terminal). Press enter to run the Software Center.\nIf it wasn't already in the launcher before you ran it, it should appear in the launcher once you've started it. Then you can right-click on its icon in the Unity launcher and select the option to pin it. That will keep it easily accessible in the launcher, even after you've exited it, and it will be easy to run in the future.\nThis general methods works for almost any graphical program (though the technique for typing the command for it is only applicable if you know the command). For example, if Firefox didn't appear in the Unity launcher, you could search for it, run it, and pin it, all the same way.\n", "Q: How to remove KDE desktop from Ubuntu So I installed kde desktop from this repository \n ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\n\nand installed it \nsudo apt-get install kde-standard kubuntu-desktop\n\nI don't like KDE and want to get ride of it.\nIs there a way to completely remove KDE desktop with its software without braking my Ubuntu install. \n\nA: This can be solved by using ppa-purge to remove the packages you installed from the KDE Backports PPA:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\n\n\nA: I used Synaptic Package Manager to remove it. It worked very very well. \nThe only thing that I would recommend is to have caution, since it is a very powerful program. Also, be patient and detail oriented. \nlook for the KDE Desktop Environment section and mark all installed packages for complete removal. Double check your choices and proceed once satisfied. \nIt will take a few minutes to do the job, but it will. It was easy and it even restored the Ubuntu greeter instead of the Kubuntu greeter.\nHope this works!\n\nA: sudo apt-get remove kde-full\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove\n\nThis will do the trick\nedit: the first command will delete kde-full package, the second command will delete all remaining kde packages depending on kde-full which no longer exists\n", "Q: Where does a compiled program go? I followed instructions to download wine 1.7.1 source to apply a patch to insert into playonlinux. \nThe compiling seems to go well, it says build complete at the end. But now what? The source folder has a million things in it. How do I know it even worked right?\nNote: I don't want to replace my default wine, or I would do make install like the instructions say. I want to insert it into playonlinux to use as a prefix\nCommands that I've used:\ncd wine-1.7.1    \nwget -q http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6901628/disable-dynamic-vertex-buffers.patch  -O - | patch -p1    \n./configure    \nmake\n\n\nA: Some Info\nWhen you compile a program from scratch, the end result will be one or more binary files for the program. These are computer readable files that do not contain code or text, though they may use other text files. Think of it as describing a picture, with words (the code), to an artist (the computer) so he can then make the final result (the binary file). \nMost system installed binaries are in /usr/bin. When you invoke a terminal command that begins with a command rather than a file name (which may or may not be a binary file), it will look in /usr/bin for the binary and run it. For example, ls in the terminal will actually invoke the /usr/bin/ls binary file.\nIf you want to run an .exe with wine, for example, you would use ./bin/wine [exe file]. This demonstrates that the binary will not have a file name extension.\nWhere are binary files put?\nAnyway, these binary files are usually located in the ./bin folder in the source tree after compiling, unless you used the --prefix option with ./configure. With Wine, it may be different, perhaps check ./wine/bin.\n", "Q: Touchscreen Support for Ubuntu 12.04LTS Im currently using a Lenovo IdeaPad P400 Touch and created a LiveUSB version of Ubuntu 12.04LTS and I'm wondering how to get the touchscreen working on ubuntu. I have read a couple of forums and saw answers for Ubuntu 13 and I'm also aware it has an issue with the time it takes to recognize the touchscreen device. I am a relatively novice linux user, but have been using it for quite some time.\n\nA: I posted a similar question recently. Am I the only one who finds it ironic that Canonical claims Ubuntu is touch optimised, yet touchscreens still do not work \"out of the box\" in Ubuntu 12.04 or 13.10?\nNow a \"sort of\" fix. I have the same model & while touch screen does not work perfectly, you can make it work \"relatively well\" by putting your computer into suspend, wait 30 seconds, then wake it.

In version ubuntu 12.04 does not come with the keyboard to ABNT2 Brazilian?\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Try to type setxkbmap -model abnt2 -layout br, or alternatively, reconfigure the keyboard, following the instructions of the command dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration.\n\nA: Yes, it does. You only have to check the Layout list and look for Brazillian. Go to System Settings, then Region and Language, Layouts. Hit the + symbol:\n\nIn the search box type Brazil\n\nSelect Portuguese (Brazil, eliminate dead keys), then click Add. Done.\nThis is how the Layout looks like.\n\n\nA: Indeed setxkbmap -model abnt2 -layout br works.

I installed Git (the one that says \"Fast, scalable, distributed revision control system\") from Ubuntu software center.\nI also choose the optional packs (git-gui and gitk).\nAll of these steps got successfully completed but I am not sure how to invoke Git-Gui.\nCan some one let me know how ?\n\nA: gitk should be invoked from command-line in your root git repository. You should look into git-cola for more featureful git gui.\n\nA: The Git GUI is accessible from the Lens. Press the Super key and type \"Git\", then click on the icon that appears:\n\nIf you wish to retain the Git GUI icon in the Launcher right click on it and select \"Lock to Launcher\".\n\nA: That can be confusing because the package is called git-gui but that program is executed in the terminal through the git binary with gui as the parameter (a parameter in the terminal is just a string of text that gets passed to the program (git binary), the string of text in this case being gui. The program will decide what it will do based on that parameter.)\nThis is what you execute, change directory into your project directory before you invoke the command:\ngit gui\n\n\nYou will also have to initialize a git repository before you can \"git gui\".\nCreate a directory where all your source files and other assets will live:\nmkdir myprojectname\n\ncd myprojectname\n\ngit init\n\nNow you have a local git repo.\nThe repository is the .git directory in you project directory. dot (.) files & directories are hidden in Linux. You can see hidden files in your file manager by hitting ctrl + h. In the command line you would pass the -a parameter to the ls command:\nls -a\n\n\nYou may not have git-gui installed. This command will install git, git-gui and a couple of other packages related to git, for Debian distros, use your package manager if you're using another family.\nsudo apt-get install git-all\n\nIf you already have git installed but not git-gui, run:\nsudo apt-get install git-gui\n\n\nI wrote a bit more information on git than just the git-gui because I thought that people coming to this page are possibly not well versed in Linux and git if they want to use the gui part of it. Sure the gui is good and it really is just an interface to the commands that you will run on the command line. The command line is more powerfúl however because you can do things through it that you can't do through a GUI and it is much quicker. You can learn the gist of git through the gui but I do recommend that you learn about the Linux command line if you want to get serious about programming and computers. There are plenty of books on Amazon that are great for that.\n", "Q: Is there any way to install MPV without having to compile it from source? Hello does any know about/or have a mpv package compiled for 13.04?\nI have searched for a PPA without any luck.\n\nA: Debian offers the mpv package since Jessie, and it's available on testing/unstable, so it should be included in universe repositories, as Ubuntu imports unstable repositories for non-LTS releases, and testing for LTS.

The closest thing I'm aware of to Super GRUB 2 Disk for EFI-based systems is the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. You should be able to use it to get into Windows. For a longer-term solution, you should delete GRUB from the EFI System Partition (ESP) on your computer. You can do this from a Linux live CD or from Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the ESP:\n\n*\n\n*In Linux, the ESP is identified as having its \"boot flag\" set in parted or GParted. Find the ESP and mount it somewhere (/boot/efi is traditional, but a live CD is unlikely to have that mount point, so you can use somewhere else).\n\n*In Windows, open an Administrator Command Prompt window and type mountvol S: /S. You can use a mount point other than S:, if you like.\n\n\n*Delete the EFI/ubuntu directory, and the files it contains, from the ESP.\n\n\nNote that this procedure assumes that you have not run Boot Repair on the computer. If you've run Boot Repair, this procedure may be ineffective, but it should do no harm. If you've run Boot Repair and this procedure does not work, run Boot Repair again and select the option from the Advanced menu to restore backed-up files. That should get Windows booting again.\nA couple of alternatives to this procedure are to install rEFInd to your hard disk (which might be desirable if you want to dual-boot with another OS) or to use efibootmgr in Linux to re-order the firmware's boot options. (EFI version 2 shells and some firmware user interfaces provide equivalent functionality to efibootmgr, too.)\n", "Q: Dash is not behaving normal in Ubuntu 13.04 There is a whitish rectangle in the left-bottom corner and the top-left corner is turning dark and blinking for a while when I click on something in dash.\n  It did not happen in Quantal or Precise.\n\nA: Steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*For this you need to install CompizConfig Settings Manager\n\n*Then under CCSM go to Desktop -> Ubuntu Unity Plugin -> General -> Dash Blur\n\n*In that Dash Blur options set option as \"No Blur\"\nThat's it .\n", "Q: xubuntu 12.04 doesn't seem to have option to not \"sleep\" computer When I right-click on the battery and pursue the ac power setting options, there is no option to not put the computer to sleep.

On the back it has two switches for setting up RAID. I have it set to RAID 0 so I can use the full 6TB. The problem with it is that it won't power on. So I pulled the hard drives out to get to the data. And for those of you wondering I did buy a new power supply and I changed the cooling fan inside it and still no power. \nI put the two 3TB hard drives in my computer then went into the bios and whiched the SATA controller to RAID. After that I booted into to Ubuntu 12.04 and I noticed that they weren't mounted. So I opened Disk Utility and  I can see the two drives there but I can not mount them. I assume the reason is that the two drives were previously being used in RAID 0 and I need to set up the RAID array in Disk Utility but I don't quite know what I am doing and I don't want to lose the data.\nOh and yes my motherboard does support 3TB.\n\nA: You can set up RAID 0 with mdadm. For example, I made it visible in both Windows and Ubuntu using --build command:\n# mknod /dev/md1 b 9 1\n# sudo mdadm --build --verbose --chunk=64K /dev/md1 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdh /dev/sdi\n\nDo not use --create command, because it will destroy your array. And remember that you should build array on every system startup. Also, set chunk size according to your array chunk size, else results will be unpredictable.\nOK, mdadm is the software application and is placed inside the package of the same name. To 'enable' it you should install it:\nsudo apt-get install mdadm\n\nChunk size is the size of the blocks on which data are divided to fit on both RAID drives. You can retrieve it from your Fantom storage settings.\nAnd, the last: you can build your array during installation, then install Ubuntu, reboot and it should work! At least, if you have only 2 internal drives... Because drive order can change if you have > 2 drives. I'm suffering from this effect. But I found solution: run the command before mount -a runs. This should be done by runlevel injection.\nBut you do not need to do this, because you just have to build array once, retrieve the data and put the drives back, right? And when array is built, there will be nodes:\n$ ls -l /dev/md1*\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk   9, 1 sept. 10 05:30 /dev/md1\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 259, 0 sept. 10 05:30 /dev/md1p1\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 259, 1 sept. 10 05:48 /dev/md1p2\n\n", "Q: libpng15.so.15, cannot open shared object file I recently downloaded a binary of Blender, and upon running it on got the following error: \njdphenix@jdphenix:~/blender/blender_59865$ ./blender\n./blender: error while loading shared libraries: libpng15.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nMy first thought was to search for libpng using apt-cache, but no versions matched what Blender was looking for, so I downloaded the libpng v15 source from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng15/ and built it using the normal ./configure, make install type routine. \nAfter this, I still got the same error, so I checked whereis: \njdphenix@jdphenix:~/blender/blender_59865$ whereis libpng15.so.15\nlibpng15.so: /usr/local/lib/libpng15.so /usr/local/lib/libpng15.so.15\n\nIt where I expected it to be.

No dice, because it requires libpng15.so.15 to even do that. \nAt this point, I feel that I might be missing something fundamental here. Is there something else I can break/unbreak/try to get this up and running? \n\nA: OK, it seems that Blender seeks this library inside /usr/lib instead of /usr/local/lib. The answer is trivial: make there symbolic link:\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libpng15.so /usr/lib\n\nElse, you can change prefix while ./configure your libpng.so:\n./configure --prefix=/usr\n\nThus make install will install libpng15.so direct into /usr/lib.\n", "Q: wsnet simulator: Segmentation fault (core dumped) during installation I installed wsnet simulator about one month ago and everything was OK (I had any problem). \nNow I uninstalled wsnet ( sudo rm –r /usr/local/wsnet.2)\nI want to install it again and I follow install steps in this web page.\nin step 3 when I use make command I get this error : \nrng.c: In function ‘create_rng’: \nrng.c:164:14: error: variable ‘r’ set but not used [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable] \ncc1: all warnings being treated as errors \nmake[3]: *** [wsnet-rng.o] Error 1 \nmake[3]: Leaving directory `/home/administrator/wsnet/src' \nmake[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 \nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/administrator/wsnet/src' \nmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 \nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/administrator/wsnet' \nmake: *** [all] Error 2 \n\nBecause of this error I disable (clear) -Werror flag in configure.ac files and I type         “make” command again.

In older Ubuntu releases, you were able to access the SMB shares mounted with Nautilus by going into the ~/.gvfs/ directory. I found it very convenient, since I like to use Nautilus to mount the shares, but do all disk operations (copy, mv, find etc.) using command line.\nI now have Ubuntu 13.04, and even though I can mount the share and use it with Nautilus (which I never use), I am unable to find the actual mount point. Is it still somewhere? Or has it been abandoned? Can I get it back?\nI know that I can mount the shares using CIFS and /etc/fstab, but I'd rather use the user space. That way, when I install a new system or transfer my home to another machine, my preferences (including credentials) stay in my home directory and I don't need to worry about updating fstab.\nAlso, I do not want to mount it manually with sudo (with sudo mount -t cifs ...). Yes, I could create an alias or a script, but then I would have to either type my password every time or store my password in a credentials file. And type the sudo password. And then each time I encounter a new share, I'd need to remember how to create a credentials file. So yes, I might end up with this solution, but I would rather not change my current habits, if it is possible.\nFurthermore, there is the matter of other users for which I often provide a simple command-line solution. In 13.04, this is no longer possible (for example, because the users to whom I provide the solution are not allowed to sudo mount on their machines).\nIn any case, I'm curious as to what happened to gvfs and why I can't see the mounted directories.\n\nA: In 13.04, gvfs user-mounts are moved to the /run filesystem\n/run/user/<username>/gvfs\n\nsee Why do my gvfs mounts not show up under ~/.gvfs or /run/user/<login>/gvfs?\n[not flagged as duplicate because the answers there are unclear]\nIf you want to keep the old links / scripts etc., just do\nrmdir ~/.gvfs/\nln -s /run/user/<username>/gvfs ~/.gvfs\n\nUpdate: gvfs has been deprecated, use 'gio mount' instead. Now smb mounts are located on $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gvfs.\n\nA: You can also mount it manually using mount in for instance /mnt \nLike \nsudo mount -t cifs -o user=foobar,password=foobar,rw,hard,nosetuids,noperm,sec=ntlm //192.168.1.2/Drive ~/mnt/mount_point\n\n(from How can I mount cifs shares in (k)ubuntu 13.04?)\n\nA: In 15.04, 15.10 and at this moment 16.04 (not released yet) there is a confirmed bug in the gvfs package which prevents the \n/run/user/<*userId>*/gvfs  \n\nto work like expected.

I have important files that I want backed up, and I believe that I'm after RAID0. If that's not correct please don't hesitate to advise me otherwise.\nI have absolutely no idea how to do this, I'm very new to Linux in general, the version I'm running is 13.10, the drive names are as follows:\nDrive1 = /dev/sdd\nDrive2 = /dev/sde\n\nCan I do this from command line? \nI also believe that I should be using the ext4 type for the drive. \n\nA: \nI have important files that I want backed up, and I believe that I'm after RAID0.\n  If that's not correct please don't hesitate to advise me otherwise.\n\nThat is not correct.\nPlease read this canonical post on RAID levels on our sister site. \nThe brief answer is:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are after RAID 1 (mirror).\n\n*RAID 0 is the unsafest thing there is.\n\n*RAID does not replace a backup.\n\n\nLets expand on the last. RAID 1 (mirror) (or any RAID level other than 0) will help you recover from a failed disk. It will not help you in case of a fire, theft, or similar disasters. Therefor the mantra is The only good backup is an off-site backup.\nRAID can (and will) help to keep your files safe during backups. \nIn professional IT settings RAID is often used to keep the server running until 5 PM after a disk has failed. After that (and outside office hours) emergency maintenance can be performed. It does not replace backups.\n\nI have absolutely no idea how to do this,\n\nIn Linux you probably want to use mdadm.\n\nCan I do this from command line? \n\nYes, you can do this from the command line, in several ways.\nAssuming your drives are empty (with no data on it which you want to keep):\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition the drives with filesystem FD (RAID autodetect)\n\n*`mdadm --create /dev/md1 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1\n\n\nYou now have a new virtual disk called /dev/md1. Anything you write to it will be written to both disks, thus keeping your data safer. Partition that as you would normally partition a disk.\nIf you do not have enough space to start with two clean drives, but enough space to start with a single empty drive then you can create the array using the missing parameter, copy the data to it and then add the second drive. If this is the case then please add that to the OP.\n\nA: RAID in general is not a way to do do backups. RAID is about performance, reliability and cost. In particular, if your goal is to recover a file that has been erroneously deleted, RAID, whatever the level, is not going to help.\nMoreover, if you have important files, RAID0 is definitely not the way to go. RAID0 doubles the risk of data loss.\nYou might configure your second disk as a backup storage but that is probably not the optimal way. Usually, you want to backup your files through the network to a different machine.\nIf you just want to protect your data from a single disk failure, use software mirroring (RAID1).\n", "Q: black screen after logout I have ubuntu 13.04 installed and normally I use MATE as desktop viewer.

And use 'aptitude' to install packages instead of apt-get.\nHere's why:\naptitude-vs-apt-get\nI'm guessing it's an issue with the apt-get. \n\nA: Ok, I found the issue. Is just not possible. You have packages that depends on the 5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 version of libmysqlclient18 while libmariadbclient18 depends on 5.5.32+maria-1~raring.\nThe solution, either delete the packages that depends of the 5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 version with sudo apt-get -f autoremove libmysqlclient18 (NOT RECOMENDABLE) or tell the package maintainer to fix their stuff because is impossible to install it without breaking the system. How I know?\nIn the long list of 152 packages there are a \"critical\" packages that depends of that specific version of libmysqlclient18 hence apt-get reuses to delete it and provokes this mayor breakages.\nInform the packages maintainers to fix their stuff correctly.\nIf you want to know which package is use:\napt-cache rdepends libmysqlclient18=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1\n\nWill tell you the packages that has an implicit dependency of that version, then you only need to compare with a list of your installed packages and voila!\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.04 - Some radeon firmware files missing - low resolution problem I have a MSI HD6870 video card and I'm using open source drivers.\nI have upgraded from kernel 3.8 to 3.11.0-031100 stable. \nAfter reboot I had low resolution problem, that is my maximum resolution is 1920x1080 but I can set and see only 1280x1024 as maximum resolution.\nI already had solved this problem removing the nomodeset option from /etc/default/grub when using kernel 3.8. So I decided to install kernel 3.11 and the low resolution problem came back. It's strange because the grub still has no nomodeset option now.\nI noticed that I have some radeon firmware files missing in kernel 3.11 that in kernel 3.8 was not, therefore I found this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-firmware/+bug/1183777.\nThey say that it has been solved with linux-firmware package v1.113 but I have linux-firmware 1.106 so maybe it's due to kernel 3.11 has been released for ubuntu 13.10 and I have 13.04, \nso how can I solve this firmware files missing?\nI'm assuming that the radeon firmware files missing is related to my resolution problem, but I'm not sure so please tell me if I'm wrong, if so how can I solve the resolution problem?\nThanks\n\nA: I had the same problem after upgradeing to 13.10 on a AMD HD4650 and the OS radeon drivers.

It offers the power of rsync with incremental backups, encryption, scheduling, and support for remote services.\nWith Déjà Dup, you can quickly revert files to previous versions or restore missing files from a file manager window. It’s a graphical frontend to Duplicity, which itself uses rsync.

I'd like to see the full How-To on how to use manual partitioning during Ubuntu installation. The existing guides (at least those I found here) cover only automatic part and leave untouched the manual part (or extremely short and contain no pictures).\nI'd like to cover such situations:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have blank disk\n\n*If your disk contains Windows installed\n\n*If your disk contains other systems: \n\n*If it is GPT, RAID or LVM\n\n*If you have a OEM-preinstalled copy of Windows 8\n\nA: If you have disk that contains Windows installed\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Ubuntu Installation media.\n\n*Unmount any mounted drives if they exist.\n\n*Proceed to Step 4. Choose \"Something else\" and click Continue:\n\n\n\nYou will see partition table. It will look like this:\n\n\n\n*Free some space for Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the Windows drive (not the loader!). It should be the biggest drive in the map. \n\n*Click Change... button. Reduce Windows' partition to 60% of it's size. Notice that you should remain some free space on it (8 – 20 GiB should be enough).\n\n\n*If you want, you can delete some partitions. This is done by clicking - button. Do not delete Windows partition!\nAnd ~40 GiB should be kept for Ubuntu. Click OK and Continue to write changes on disk.\n\n*Now your partition table should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now, you can proceed with steps 4 – 7 of part about blank installation. Notice that swap will be placed on logical partition. This doesn't matter, in any case it will work perfect.\n\n\nA: If you have a OEM-preinstalled copy of Windows 8 or later\nComputers with OEM installs of Windows usually come with more than 1 or 2 partitions. Starting with Windows 8 the partition table should be GPT, allowing for more than 4 primary partitions.\n1. Resizing the Windows partition\nThere are at least 2 ways doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*from the live media\n\n*in Windows\n\n\nA. Resizing from Ubuntu live media\nYou can run GParted or use only the manual partitioning menu of the installer.\nB. The safer option: Resizing from within Windows\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize the Windows partition with Disk Management (run diskmgmt.msc).\n\nSelect your Windows partition and choose \"Shrink Volume…\" from the context menu.\n\nThis will usually shrink to the minimum possible, you may want to adjust the value to leave more space for Windows.\n\n\n*Optionally disable fast startup and probably disable hibernation, if it is activated and you intend to access the Windows partition with Ubuntu. Run powercfg.cpl and navigate to Power Options > System Settings through \"Choose what the power button does\".\n\n\n\n2. Manually setting up the partition layout for Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Attention! No, you don't want to erase the entire disk and Windows along with it. Choose the Something else option if you see this screen. (Something else may be the most difficult option to understand, but considering existing bugs you know what you will get.)\n\n\n\n*You will get to the manual partitioning menu, where you should at least create a root partition (/) and a swap partition.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Option 1: add only a root partition\n\n\n*Option 2: add a root and home partition\n\n\n…finally add the swap partition:\n\nNote that there usually is an existing EFI System Partition (short ESP, efi in the screenshot), that the installer will automatically detect and mount to install EFI loaders and programs.\n\n\nRelated bug reports\n\n\n*\n\n*GPT partition tables are not properly detected - Ubiquity suggests erasing disk\nRelated\n\n\n*\n\n*My answer to SU question: Clean install Windows 8.1 or Windows 8 from OEM key (now updated with info for Windows 10)\n\n*Adding an encrypted partition with pam_mount during login (1, 2)\n\n\nA: Do any of the following help you? (sorry, I don't have enough rep to comment this).\n\nNow suppose that we are going to install Ubuntu 11.04 and at first of the installation process we will meet Allocate drive space screen (the most important step in the installation process). In Allocate drive space screen Select Something else to partition your disk drive manually.\nThe Next screen shows sda1 partition for Windows Xp and free space, Now we are going to install Ubuntu 11.04 so we need to create / partition and Swap.\nCreate / Partition:\nSelect free space and press on Add button.\nUbuntu 11.04 requires about 4.4 GB, So we should type a value more than 4.4 GB. Here in my case I put 6000 MB i.e 6 GB.\nFrom \"Use as\" I selected Ext4 journalling file system.\nFrom \"Mount point\" I selected /.\nPress Add button to create / partition.\nCreate Swap:\nIn the previous screen select free space, and press Add button.\nSwap doesn't need much space. In my case I put 500 MB\nFrom \"Use as\" select Swap area\nNo need to Mount point.\nClick Ok button to create swap.\nInstall:\nNow we have /, partition, and swap so we are ready to install.\nTo start installation process press Install now button.\n\nManual partitioning on Ubuntu installation\nFor installing Windows on a separate partition, this should be fairly self explanatory from the \"Install Ubuntu alongside them\" option, however you may come across the following bug.\n\nYour existing partition (Windows) is on the left, Ubuntu is on the right. That's the standard order when shrinking one partition to create another for dual-booting.\n\nInstalling Ubuntu with Windows installed on a partition\n\nA: Partition shows \"unknown\" Used in GParted\nThis happened to me on 17.10 because my Windows 10 Lenovo P51 used a Logical Disk Manager (LDM) Partition.\nThe solution was to shrink the partition from inside Windows as shown at: https://askubuntu.com/a/521195/52975\nYou can then install Ubuntu on the free space allocated.\nCannot shrink disk fully\nThen I hit the second problem: Windows said I had 400Gb of free space in the partition, but I could only shrink 250Gb.\nThe solution was to go inside Windows and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Page File (AKA Windows' swap)\n\n*Disable System Protection\n\n\nas mentioned at: https://superuser.com/questions/1017764/how-to-shrink-a-windows-10-partition/1060508#1060508\nThen after the reboot, it let me shrink it all the way.\n\nA: If you have blank disk\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu Installation media. This can be either CD or USB stick.\n\n*Start the installation. Proceed to Step 4 and choose \"Something else\":\n\n\n*You will see your disk as /dev/sda or /dev/mapper/pdc_* (RAID case, * means that your letters are different from ours)\nClick \"New Partition Table...\" You will see that you have free space on your disk now:\n\n\n*(Recommended) Create partition for swap. Swap is the partition for keeping unneeded memory pages, like Windows swap. Also it can be used for hibernation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select free space and click +\n\n*Set parameters like on the picture below:\n\nNotice that you should set swap size more than you have physical memory in order to use hibernation. Also, you can place it in the end of disk, but thus it will be slow.\n\n*Create partition for / (root fs). This is the filesystem that contains your kernel, boot files, system files, command-line utilities, libraries, system-wide configuration files and logs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select free space and click +\n\n*Set parameters like on the picture below:\n\n10 – 20 GiB should be enough\n\n*Create partition for /home. This is the filesystem for your user's files: documents, images, music and videos. It's much more like Users folder in Windows.\nYou can do this just like in step 5 and even choose other fs type (though I recommend use ext4 instead of reiserfs. Simply, the first is much more flexible and the second is quicker)\n\n*(Optional) Create separate partitions for /boot, /tmp and /var. Set their size according to your needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot should be 100 – 500 MiB\n\n*/var and /tmp should be > 5 GiB\n\n\n*If you doubt about which device for boot loader installation to choose, leave it default. It would be set by installer. But sometimes it does mistakes. Let me guide you how to deal with it:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use only one hard disk, select or leave /dev/sda intact.\n\n*If you use more than one hard disk with no RAID, select the one from which your system does boot. You can also select other disk and set BIOS to boot from it.\n\n*If you have RAID from which your system starts, it will be /dev/mapper/...\nBe sure that you select entire disk, not a single partition!\nAfter all, you should see your disk like this:\n\nAs LiveWireBT noticed in comments, it is recommended to place root partition onto primary partition on MBR scheme disks.

The \"fast boot\" feature in the firmware is relatively unimportant. The Windows \"fast startup\" feature, though, turns the shutdown process into a suspend-to-disk operation. When this is done, filesystems are not properly shut down, so when a filesystem is accessed in Linux, damage can result.\n\nA: Nothing worked... Windows always corrupts files while booting... \nSo, I found workaround: before I shut down Windows I unmount D:\\ with a *.bat file that contains the command\nmountvol D:\\ /D \n\nand after I boot into windows again, I use another *.bat file with the command \nmountvol D: 'VolumeName'\n\nto mount the drive. \nThis way windows doesn't have access to D:\\ while shutting down or booting... \n", "Q: Install cx_Oracle on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I'm trying to install cx_Oracle for Python on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64 bit).\nI've installed Instant Client Package from:\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html\nI did it using alien for converting to dpm and then used dpkg -i.\nI've installed cx_Oracle from (CentOS 5 x86_64 RPM (Oracle 11g, Python 2.7)):\nhttp://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/\nI did it using alien for converting to dpm and then used dpkg -i.\nHowever, trying to import cx_Oracle just reports:\nFile \"test.py\", line 1, in <module>\n  import cx_Oracle\nImportError: No module named cx_Oracle\n\n\nA: Needed:\ncd /usr/lib/python2.7\nsudo mv site-packages/cx_Oracle* dist-packages/\nsudo rmdir site-packages/\nsudo ln -s dist-packages site-packages\nsudo ldconfig\n\nThanks to http://bayo.opadeyi.net/2011/07/setting-up-cxoracle-on-ubuntu-1104.html\n", "Q: save mysql ouput as text?

I recently posted an answer where I wrote add the PPA. But I now realize, that I have no idea what the difference between a PPA and a Repository is. So can someone please explain it to me? \n\nA: Repository is  a place where package are stored or maintained for download or update.These  are servers which contain sets of packages.\nA Personal Package Archive (PPA) is a special software repository for uploading source packages to be built and published as an APT repository by Launchpad or a similar application. Mostly it is maintained by people who are not  official Ubuntu developer\n\nA: In short:\n\n*\n\n*A repository is a collection of packages, hosted on an arbitrary server.\n\n*A PPA is also a collection of packages, hosted on the Launchpad servers.\n\n*Thus, a PPA is a special kind of repository. Like a square is a special kind of rectangle.\n\nThe main difference is the hoster. Basically, if you are a programmer and want to develop and distribute your own packages, and you have your own root server in the Internet, you can set up your own repository on it. Great! But what if you don't have a root server, and you don't want to pay for one, but still want to develop and distribute your own packages? Well, then there's Launchpad. It's offering PPAs as a service for exactly that use case. You can basically create your own repository on Launchpad, and manage your own packages there.\nLet's have a look at an illustrating example.\n\n*\n\n*First, assume you want to install the MATE Desktop Environment (a Gnome 2 fork) on Ubuntu Saucy Salamander. It is not contained in the official repos, nor do the devs maintain a PPA. Instead, they have their own repo. You could add it like so:\n $ sudo add-apt-repository http://packages.mate-desktop.org/repo/ubuntu\n\nThis would result in the following entry being added to /etc/apt/sources.list:\n deb http://packages.mate-desktop.org/repo/ubuntu saucy main\n\n\n\n*Second, assume you also want to have a look at Cinnamon  (another Gnome 2 fork). This is contained in the official repos since 13.04, but there's still a PPA maintained by the devs, useful for instance if you're interested in getting new releases quicker. You could add it like so:\n $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\n\nThis would result in the following entry being added to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gwendal-lebihan-dev-cinnamon-stable-saucy.list:\n deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable/ubuntu saucy main\n\nAs you can see, the latter entry is quite similar as the one made in point (1). In fact, both are just URLs of repositories from Ubuntu's perspective.\n\n\n*In fact, you could even add the Cinnamon PPA with the same syntax as in point (1), although this is not the typical way for adding PPAs:\n $ sudo add-apt-repository http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable/ubuntu\n\nThis would result in the following entry being added to /etc/apt/sources.list:\n deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable/ubuntu saucy main\n\nThis is the exact same entry as in point (2). Only the files that these entries are written to are handled slightly differently, but in the end, it makes no real difference. In both cases, you will end up with the packages from the Cinnamon PPA being available on your system, always after the canonical sudo apt-get update, of course.\n\nA: Repositories\n\nOn systems like Ubuntu, most software is packaged in nice .deb (or .rpm, like in Red Hat) files which contain the programs and libraries you need. These files can be downloaded or come in CDs (Ubuntu's CD is full of them). Repositories are servers which contain sets of packages.\n\nPPA\n\nPersonal Package Archives (PPA) allow you to upload Ubuntu source packages to be built and published as an apt repository by Launchpad. \n\nAlso see What are PPAs and how do I use them?\nand Wikipedia.\nTo sum it up:\n\n\n*\n\n*A repository has packages. \n\n*PPAs are archives of personal packages. \n\n*Launchpad.net holds PPAs. \n\n\nA: There is no technical differences between a repository and a PPA as far APT is concerned. Both are software repositories that offers packages, from APT point of view is the same mechanisms of installing packages.\nPPA is a repository of packages that uses Launchpad as backend. Is just another name for the same thing, that is (at least in principle) normally used for personal reasons, which automates most operations you otherwise had to do manually or setting up your own services.\nRepositories is wherever there is software, in this case, package lists and packages to be installed in Debian based distros.\nYou can have your personal repository, without the use of Launchpad and it could be called PPA, because is Personal.\nThe only difference in the usage is solely in the syntax of the add-apt-repository which uses the magic keyword ppa: instead of forcing the user to write the full url which is required for non Launchpad repositories.\n\nA: A repository is a collection of various software which enables software like apt-get, aptitude etc. to download and install said software. Their content is visible for inspection by all.  Read the Ubuntu Help Page on repositories for enlightenment.\nPPAs are special repositories for software which is not yet adopted for the entire community by the distro leadership. PPA software can have defects and can even be used for malware because they are not extensively reviewed as as the general repositories. For more, see Launchpad's explanation of PPAs and this discussion of PPAs.\n", "Q: What is the performance difference between booting Ubuntu from a USB v2 and USB v3? I like the idea of booting from a usb drive.  I probably have 50 USB 2.0 drives of various sizes, but I only have 2 USB 3.0 drives currently.  \nIf I boot from a USB 3.0, will the increased read/write speeds make a noticeable difference in performance? \n\nA: For USB 3.0 to boot, 3 things must work:\nIt must support booting by showing itself as a bootable device, most USB3.0 drives can do this.\nThe BIOS must support USB 3.0 booting.  Most PC's made in the last year should support booting from USB 3.0\nThe OS must also support a USB 3.0 boot by having the right device drivers and must be willing to boot a removable drive. For Linux, this is no problem.  The xhci module, which is needed for USB 3.0 is included in recent kernels. \nThat being said, I agree with what Rinzwind stated in his comment.  I installed Ubuntu 13.04 from a 16GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive, and from a 16GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive, both drives are made by Imitation.  \nInstallation took the same amount of time ± 10 seconds.  So no performance difference between booting Ubuntu from either a USB 2 or 3.  \nNow if you create a persistent USB, and run Ubuntu from that, it may make a difference that way, but I can't verify since I didn't test.\n", "Q: Installing wordpress in Ubuntu 13.04 I downloaded wordpress3.6.tar.gz file from wordpress.org i want to move that from my default downloads folder to /opt/lampp/htdocs folder and also un-zip it please help me out with this i'm new to this ubuntu\n\nA: Open a shell/Terminal\nDash -> Search for Terminal\nDash -> More Apps -> 'See More Results' -> Terminal\nDash -> More Apps -> Accessories -> Terminal\nKeyboard Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + T\nOnce you have your Ubuntu terminal open do the following:\n$ cd ~/Download\n$ sudo mv wordpress3.6.tar.gz /opt/lampp/htdocs/\n$ cd /opt/lampp/htdocs/\n$ tar -xvzf wordpress3.6.tar.gz\n\nA: You can move files/folders to /opt/lampp/htdocs only if you have super user rights.

The tool will open it if necessary.\nAnd I do not have to run the application by type its command. Just like I run other applications, for example from a menu.\n\nA: NOT that I know of.\nThat's basically the way SSH X11 Forwarding works.\nYou'll have to connect to the SSH Server by specifying -X or -Y, of course sshd should allow X11Forwarding.\nTo run X client applications like Firefox, chrome, you'll have to execute the application in CLI and probably run it in background and redirect the stdout and stderr to the black hole >/dev/null 2>&1 &.\nThere are some misunderstandings in your statement.\nxclock is actually a X client, it is executed on the remote SSH Server but is displayed on the X Server where ssh client resides (your Ubuntu Desktop or Xming X Server for Windows).\n", "Q: Installing ceph and ceph-osd charms on same machine?

I am going to install Ubuntu to dual boot with Windows 8 soon, but one of my friends warned me that partitioning my hard drive will slow my computer down. I run on a 500GB HDD and 8GB of ram if that helps at all. Is that true if I do it?\n\nA: It would not slow down your machine because you're not firing it up all together :)\nThe fact that only one operating system will run in a dual-boot setup, hardware resources like CPU and memory is not shared on both Operating Systems (Windows and Linux) therefore making the operating system currently running use the maximum hardware specification. Regarding the disk issue, well unless the windows partition run out of free space which eventually can be fixed by removing some files.\n\nA: There are several factors to take into account but generally speaking, Ubuntu normally is at disadvantage when installing. This is because Windows is normally at the beginning of the disk, and Ubuntu (or any other distro) is at the end. Disks are faster then closer they are to the start, hence Windows will have shortest seek times, that will give it a boost opposed to Ubuntu.\nAnother thing is that Windows will not run at the same time that Ubuntu, nor the reverse. Hence while you are running Windows, only your system inherent performance is taken into account. I have not seen (nor imagine) any circumstance that Windows will slow down because you installed Ubuntu.\nBottom line, Windows normally will have the advantage on the hardware, but Ubuntu (Linux) will use it more efficiently. That's all.\n\nA: Partitioning will decrease the current size of your Windows partition. This will affect storage capacity, not speed. \n\nA: It will slow down your computer in one case: if you have too small amount of free space on your Windows partition. Thus Windows will show drive C: (or D:) with red bar and will prompt you for cleaning. Just remember that you need to keep ~10 GiBs free space on your Windows hard drive and ~40 GiBs for Ubuntu.\n\nA: While all ten other answers are correct that there will be no noticeable difference in running time.  Boot time will plummet on modern PCs as you will not be able to enable bios caching (at least none of my systems will bios cache to grub) and grub will have a pause and select time of it's own which will slow down boot time (configurable).\nBottom line do it but be aware that you can no-longer boot to windows in under 5 seconds (assumes ssd and bios caching)\n\nA: Nobody here has addressed the issue of the windows page file. If you rely on the page file currently and reducing the space available to windows decreases your page file size, it can lower the total memory consumption (hardware + paged) available to Windows.\nReally a minor issue though.\n\nA: I would just like to add to this that I have noticed a significant performance decrease in my Windows 7 after repartitioning my Windows drive to create space for Ubuntu, although I did screw around with the partitioning quite a bit (created partition to install Ubuntu to, had some issues, repartitioned, more issues) before actually installing Ubuntu to unpartitioned space.\nSo I checked on Windows whether the drive might be fragmented because this is the only logical reason that I could think my Windows is running slower after the dual boot installation and only came up with a 1% fragmentation. Still not 100% sure why Windows is running slower now though. I might just re-install Windows to see if that helps (note if anyone else tries this, remember to reset your grub).\nCould be that I'm just so used to working on a lightning fast linux machine that Windows feels slow now :P\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu without disturbing any files, without dual boot? I have been googling for a while, and what I read says ubuntu deletes the files on the partition I install it.\nI want to install it on the c drive, but i don't want to lose its current contents. Is there any way for me to install ubuntu without disturbing any other files (Or any files other than the windows files)?\n\nA: There are plenty of guides which answer your question, let me introduce you with one of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Full How-To. It says, you should not delete any files, just reduce the Windows' partition size and install Ubuntu on vacated place.\n\n\nA: You can't suppress Windows and replace it with Ubuntu like that. Mainly because Ubuntu doesn't use NTFS, and the C:/Documents and Settings/Yourname/ means nothing to Ubuntu.\nBut, you can install Ubuntu without loosing your files with some manipulations (cheater, booo !). Note that none of your windows software will work on Ubuntu as it.\nFor example, I use Ubuntu on a 50Gb partition, and I also have a 700Gb NTFS partition for my documents.\nThe manipulation is quite simple but varies depending on your free space/an external storage disk:\n1) You have enough free space to duplicate all your files :\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu in dual-boot on a maximum-sized EXT4 partition (example, you have a 1Tb hard disk with 600Gb free, you install Ubuntu on a ~580Gb partition)\n\n\n*Boot on Ubuntu\n\n\n*Copy all your files from Windows into Ubuntu (example : My Documents, on C:/Documents and Settings/Yourname/My Documents can be moved to /home/yourname/documents).\n/!\\ Be sure to save ALL that you want, next step will completely erase your non-copied files.\n\n\n*Use OS-Uninstaller (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y os-uninstaller) to remove windows\n\n\n*Boot with a Ubuntu livecd\n\n\n*Use Gparted (from the livecd!) to delete the old windows partition (wich should be blank), and extend your Ubuntu partition.\n2)  You have an external support (usb hdd, another hard-disk connected to your motherboard, ...) :\n\n*\n\n*Copy all your files from Windows into the external support\n/!\\ Be sure to save ALL that you want, next step will completely erase your non-copied files.\n\n\n*Install a brand new Ubuntu and erase all your windows files.\n\n\n*Copy your files from the external support into Ubuntu (/home/yourname/Documents, /home/yourname/Images, etc. )\n\nIf you don't have enough free space to duplicate nor an external storage, you could try this, BUT it's really starting to get wierd :\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu on a small EXT4 partition (like 8Gb)\n\n*Remove your Windows files (C:/Program Files and C:/Windows)\n\n*Always use the NTFS partition mounted (usually in /media/XXX)to play with your files, but you will have to deal with strange directories like /media/XXX/Documents \\and \\Settings/Yourname/My \\Documents/ for your old \"My Documents\" directory.\n\n*Delete the Windows entries from Grub or skip grub to always start on Ubuntu.\n\nEDIT : this last solution is very similar to the one Danatela suggested while I was writing this.\n", "Q: How to remove Intel's Open Source Technology Center Driver? I have downloaded and installed Intel's drivers from this link, following all instructions: https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/2013/intelr-linux-graphics-installer-version-1.0.2\nHowever, I would like to return to stock Ubuntu's driver configuration. How would I go about doing this? I've found this link, but it's only for Ubuntu 12.10: http://theclonker.de/?p=89\nAccording to Synaptic, Intel's repository added the following packages locally (may contain typos; forgive me):\ni915-3.9-3.8-dkms\nintel-linux-graphics-installer\nlibdrm-dev\nlibdrm-intel1\nlibdrm-intel1:i386\nlibdrm-nouveau2\nlibdrm-nouveau2:i386\nlibdrm-radeon1\nlibdrm-radeon1:i386\nlibdrm2\nlibdrm2:i386\nlibkms1\nlibva-drm1\nlibva-egl1\nlibva-glx1\nlibva-tpi1\nlibva-wayland1\nlibva-X11-1\nlibva1\nx11proto-input-dev\nxserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nI'm not sure whether the above list is complete and/or exhaustive as to the changes the Intel installer made.\nAlso important to note, Intel's instructions to delete their repository in Software Sources just flat-out doesn't work. It removes the repository, but keeps the packages installed locally.\n\nA: All right. I have a history of answering my own questions, and here goes again:\nThanks to Saurav Kumar, I had another look at the second link I put in my question. Here's what you gotta do in Ubuntu 13.04:\nOpen the terminal and create a new file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/preferences.d/intel-removal\n\nCopy+paste the following contents (MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO TABS, SPACES OR INDENTS BEFORE ANY LINES, and replace raring with your own release):\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=raring*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nPackage: *\nPin: origin download.01.org\nPin-Priority: -100\n\nSave the file and close gedit.\nRun:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIn my case, this simply downgraded and removed some packages. I cannot guarantee what it will do on your system, because I'm a noob like that. So run at your own leisure, but don't blame me if things go wrong.\nNow the cleaning up bit:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/intel-removal\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intellinuxgraphics.list*\nsudo apt-get update\n\nFollowed by removing the actual drivers (i915-3.9-3.8-dkms WILL be different depending on your version of Ubuntu):\nsudo apt-get purge i915-3.9-3.8-dkms intel-linux-graphics-installer\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nReboot, et voilà, we're done.

I assume it creates multiple desktops (not workspaces - I know the difference) as the name so pragmatically implies. I set it to 2, and if it does create multiple desktops I cannot figure out how to switch between them. I've googled and checked AskUbuntu.\n\nA: In the previous version of my answer I mixed up the concepts of viewports and desktops. What I wrote below applies to viewports, not desktops. Desktops don't seem to be supported any more, the setting in CCSM is probably outdated and doesn't do anything useful anymore. I edited my answer accordingly.\n\nThere are several ways to switch between viewports:\nKeyboard shortcuts\nYou can switch between your viewports by a variation of the cursor keys. For example, to go to the viewport that is located to the right of the viewport you currently are on, press Ctrl-Alt-Right. To go to the viewport that is located to the bottom of your current viewport, press Ctrl-Alt-Down, and so forth.\nButton in Launcher\nThere is a button in the Unity launcher (the bar at the left side) that allows you to switch between viewports with your mouse. The symbol shows the 4 viewports (2 x 2) that were standard before Canonical decided that having multiple viewports activated by default was confusing for people. If you click on that button, you get a \"bird's eye\" view on all your viewports and can simply click on the one you'd like to go to.\nOther ways\nSwitching between viewports with the keyboard shortcuts or the launcher button are the most common methods, but there are more. I, for example, have activated one of the \"active corners\" to show the \"bird's eye\" view described above. So, whenever I move the mouse cursor to the lower right corner of the current viewport, I can switch to another one. You can configure the \"active corners\" with tweaking tools like Unity Tweak Tool.\n", "Q: How do I prevent git from requiring sudo on every git command I created a directory /var/www to store my web apps clone in. When I initially cloned the app from GitHub it required me to use sudo and every time I do a git pull it's requiring sudo. I'm running into some problems because of this. For example, my ssh keys are not matching up. So when I do my git pull, I'm having to use HTTPS instead of ssh and manually enter my username and password every time I want to pull and update my app. How do I configure this so I don't have to use sudo every time I use git?\n\nA: A couple of things are going on here:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you sudo git checkout ..., all those files are owned by the root user and root group. With the standard permissions, that's why subsequent alterations to those files require you be root.\n\n*/var/www/ by default is owned by www-data group. Something your user is not by default.\nThe easiest way to write in /var/www/ is to just add your user to the www-data group. You can of course, change the directory to be owned by your user but this can have some nasty knock-on effects if you're not pre-empting them.\nYou'll need to re-log in after adding your user to the www-data group.\nIn your case specifically, you're going to need to fix your current mess of root-owned data. You can either delete it as root (and re-checkout) but if you have unsaved work, it'll just be cleaner to pull everything back to your user.

One for ILO and the other like Eth0  In your boot up Ilo config screen, you should see the ip address that it has been assigned.  ILO is totally separate from the software side of the server.

You could also try printing out and searching the currently defined keybindings from the command line using\nbind -P | grep '\\\\\\\\'\n\nThe extra backslashes are required because a literal backslash will appear in the readline configuration as \\\\, each of which needs a further escape in the shell. Obviously you can only do that in the subshell, if the backslash is being bound in the regular shell.\nFYI there is a bind command option to remove a binding, but it is not clear how to input the keyseq argument when it is already bound \n-r  keyseq         Remove the binding for KEYSEQ.\n\nFor further information see help bind in the bash command line\n\nA: \\ escapes whatever character follows it. ; explicitly ends a command. \\; means escape the ; and pass it to the command you are invoking inside find (everything after -exec.

After installing Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS, the Windows 7 partition and an extra backup partition are no longer mounting automatically as they used to do in 10.04.2 LTS.\nI have an ATA HardDisk.\nWhat could be the problem? Any insights will be highly appreciated.\n\nA: You have to enter your partition information to /etc/fstab file. Then your disk will be mounted automatically!\nJust go for following step:\n\n\n*\n\n*First take back up of /etc/fstab\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup\n\n\n*Execute following command to get your partition UUID information that will help you to configure /etc/fstab file.\nsudo blkid\n\nSearch for your partition's UUID which you want to mount automaticall. Your HDD partitions shouls be displayed like:\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"Backup\" UUID=\"00A0CE7EA0CE7A24\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n/dev/sda5: LABEL=\"40GBTWO\" UUID=\"00A0CE7EA0CE7A24\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"7550252c-3da7-4cd9-8da3-71e9ba38e74a\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda7: UUID=\"088fd084-a011-4896-aa93-c0caaad60620\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sdb1: LABEL=\"SaurK\" UUID=\"0DB6254A58CEF6F7\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\nand so on. It is just an example but format will be same.\n\n*Now copy the UUID of the partitions which you want to insert in /etc/fstab file.\n\n*Now open /etc/fstab file and insert entry for your HDD partitions on the last line of /etc/fstab file. Take help from previous entry, for format etc:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nWhen opened your entry would be like this:\nUUID=<your_UUID_for_Disk_partitions> /media/<location_where_you_want_to_mount>             ntfs    errors=remount-ro 0\n\nJust an example:\nUUID=00A0CE7EA0CE7A24 /media/Backup               ntfs    errors=remount-ro 0\n\nyou may have to replace ntfs to ext4 or fat32 according to the file system of your partition. It displays in blkid output.\n\n*Now create location where to mount your disk partitions. Create a folder for each partitions to mount. ((note: a directory may be already created, if so ignore this step.) For example:\nsudo mkdir /media/Backup\n\n\n*Then execute this command once finished:\nsudo mount -a\n\nYou can refer this link for further help: Auto mounting with /etc/fstab\nHope it works for you..\n", "Q: How to customize hotkeys I want to customize hotkeys, but in a special way.\nThere should be global shortcuts, like Alt+Tab, but I want to create window specific shortcuts.  \nFor example:\nCtrl+K does Ctrl+PageUp in chrome, but Ctrl+K does PageUp in LibreOffice.  \nIt would be nice if global settings didn't work, except some windows specified.  \nIs there an application for this?\n\nA: I don't know whether my answer satisfies you completely!

As you may know, PPA is nice if you want to test the new technology, but as all tests you may run into problems in the process. If you are suffering problems about GNOME3 PPA, the recommended path of action is to remove them. PPA's were never meant to be solid rock but a way to get the latest of the latest in Ubuntu:\n\nKnow what you're installing. Most likely you'll use Launchpad for the majority of your PPA needs, but even so it can be dangerous to your computer. Usually the worry for me is not malicious intent, but conflicting packages. If package A requires a modified version of ffmpeg, and package B in a different repository requires a modified version of ffmpeg too, well, now there's a good chance you might not be able to watch videos, for example, with package A or B or at all.\n\n\nFor a \"novice\" or \"noob\" - my best advice is to steer clear of PPA's until you feel confident that you understand a few things about the command line, potential error messages and a few things how to diagnose issues. Foosfreedom\n\nFor removing PPA's you will need ppa-purge. If you install GNOME3 from the Ubuntu repositories you get assured of a maximum capability in your system and less likely to run into problems. PPAs are for tester and people that don't need a stable system. If what you need is solid rock where to stand, PPA's are definitively not for you.\nGood to read:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\n*How to remove PPAs?\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some “red flags” to watch out for?\n", "Q: How to install Artwiz Lime?

But there is (or has been, depending on perspective) an alternative. Pulseaudio, the sound server used with Ubuntu, comes with its own volume setting tool called pavucontrol. It isn't installed by default any longer, but you can just install it yourself from the standard repositories. \nPavucontrol allows you not only to control the volume of any application currently playing sound independently, but you can also control to which of the available output devices the applications sound is \"routed\".

I recently upgraded my laptop hard drive and did a fresh install of 12.04.3.  I stuck my old hard drive into an external enclosure to use as an external - but first, I need to get all my data off it.  The old hard drive was dual boot with Win7 and Ubuntu...here is the output of sudo fdisk -l:\n\nSo, sdb is obviously the external.  However, I've tried mounting all 3 of those partitions - sdb1, sdb2 and sdb3, and none of them seem to be my old ubuntu partition.  sdb2 is my Win7 partition (which is nice), sdb1 is my Win7 recovery partition (useless) and I'm not sure what sdb3 is (it has folders like \"BIN\", \"BOOT\", \"IMAGES_BOOT\", \"PLANFOLDER\", and so forth.\nAny ideas on where to find my ubuntu partition?  As a last resort, I can re-install the old hard drive, dump everything I need off the ubuntu partition onto another external, reinstall the new hard drive, and carry on.\nThanks! \n\nA: You may have originally done a WUBI installation, in which case Linux was installed to a file in the Windows filesystem (normally C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk). I'm not sure of the format of this file, but if it's a simple image file, you should be able to mount it as a loopback device. For instance, if you mount your former Windows C: partition at /mnt/windows, you could try:\nsudo mount -o loop /mnt/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /mnt/oldubuntu\n\n(You will have to have created both the /mnt/windows and /mnt/oldubuntu directories before doing this.)\n", "Q: The bug is not reproducible, so it is likely a hardware or OS problem I'm trying to install Samba 4.0.9 on one server but I keep getting this error everytime.

Thanks in advance. \n\nA: When debian gcc encounters an internal error it tries to run the code through the compilation core again. If it gets the same results every time it assumes it really is a bug in the compiler core. If it doesn't then you get the \"The bug is not reproducible, so it is likely a hardware or OS problem.\" message.\nThis could be caused by a bug in the compiler core that is sensitive to some external factor, a bug in the kernel or dodgy hardware.\n\nA: You may also see this message if you are running a build system that executes some build steps in parallel on a multi-core machine and one of those steps requires an output from the other, but the build system doesn't know it.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*step1: generate header file that gets used by step 2\n\n*step2: run gcc to compile a .c file that includes the header from from step 1.\nIf the build system doesn't know that step2 depends on the output of step1, then it may try to take advantage of the fact that it has multiple CPU cores available to it and run both steps at the same time.  In this case, step2 will fail because the header file it needs hasn't been generated yet.  On failure, gcc retries the compilation, but by this point, step1 has completed and the header file is available.  So, the second try succeeds and gcc assumes that the inconsistent results mean that the OS or the hardware is failing in some way, even though they are functioning perfectly.\nThis is a good example of a multi-threaded race condition, which can be a highly unpredictable thing when found in more complex scenarios (such as the build system of a large project like Samba).\nI experienced this personally using the ninja build system on another project.\nThe way to fix it is to make sure that your build scripts make the build system aware of the dependency between steps.\n", "Q: What is the naming convention for Click packages? I have made an Ubuntu Touch app and intend to upload it to the Click app store. What is the naming convention that I should use for naming my Click package?\n\nA: The package name is usually the name of your application, all in lowercase and using dashes (-) instead of spaces.\nFor example, here are a few of my applications and their package names:\n\n*\n\n*Weather Desktop became weather-desktop.\n\n\n*Ubuntu Tasks become ubuntu-tasks.\n\n\n*uBible will be ubible.\nIn addition, Click packages also use a namespace which is combined with the package name to form the App ID. The namespace is the developer's domain name reversed, so for example:\n\n*\n\n*MyAwesomeApps.com would become com.myawesomeapps.\n\n*Ubuntu.com would become com.ubuntu.\n\nIf you don't have your own domain name, you can use the default which is based on your Launchpad user name:\ncom.ubuntu.developer.<lpname>\n\nThere are a couple of things to note about your developer namespace:\n\n*\n\n*Once you've uploaded an app, it cannot be changed. Before you've uploaded an app, if you've made a mistake or would like to change it, you can ask in the #ubuntu-app-devel channel to have it changed.\n\n\n*You can only use a namespace if you own the domain it represents or if it is the default using your Launchpad user name.\nSo for example, the App ID for Ubuntu Tasks is\ncom.ubuntu.developer.mdspencer.ubuntu-tasks\n\n", "Q: Installing 'wine' triggers a kernel panic, what can I do about this?

If even cloning doesn't work, the reason is most probably a faulty drive.\n\nA: (Please, read the whole answer before doing anithing)\nQuick and Dirty (?)\nSometimes, when you don't know what to do, the best thing is start from 0. Use a Live system, do a full backup of all your data in the /home directory, if your system boots you can do dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall >> package.list and save the resultant file, then reinstall the system.\nWhen you get your new system, do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade once that is done restore your installed packages list.\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < package.list\nsudo apt-get check\nsudo apt-get deselect-upgrade\n\nNow, you got your system ready to rumble.\nI want to fix it without reinstall\nThis is tricky, and you will need to spend your time in this. You may need to read the debugging the kernel guide, and/or throw a stab in the air with the follow procedure:\nSince you said that the problem started with wine, I will assume the package is somehow dirty, or something is terribly wrong. So, instead \"executing\" lets say that we simulate:\nsudo dpkg --no-act --configure -a\n\nIf the below command produce the Kernel Panic, is safe to assume that the scripts were incorrectly unpacked or that the package is incomplete. To discard first, you may use the Recovery Mode to run a filesystem check:\n\n\n*\n\n*When your system starts chose Safe Mode (2nd option in grub menu. Hold Shift while boots if your system starts directly without Grub Menu).\n\n*From the Menu just go to Grub option, it will give a message like Updating grub will mount your system in read/write mode. Don't chose yes to mount your system in read/write mode.\n\n*Once you get the recovery menu, select check filesystem or fsck. It will take a time, repair the errors you find (if any), reboot into a normal boot, and try to run sudo dpkg --no-act --configure -a again. If no panic arises just run without the --no-act switch. It should work.\n", "Q: How do I edit the /etc/hosts file? I'm new at Linux and I just download Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  I found a spot that showed me how join my Windows Active Directory.  It has me add couple lines into the 'hosts' but I'm not able to edit the file because I do not have the permission.  I'm not the owner.  I use chmod with it rwx and still it will not let edit the file.  How do you change the permission?  Thanks\n\nA: You should use sudo -i (nano for text-based or gedit for graphical) /etc/hosts. By default normal users should not be able to edit the hosts file. Changing the ownership of hosts is not the right thing to do. \n\nA: The easiest way (most GUI) would be to use gedit. You could also use any other editor you prefer (e.g. nano or vi). Just run the editor as root using sudo and you're good to go! You need to pass 1 argument: the path to the file you want to edit (in this case /etc/hosts).\nThe full command:\nsudo -i gedit /etc/hosts\n\n\nA: Open a terminal and try this:\nsudo vi file.txt\n\nfile.txt is the file you want to edit.\nThe system will ask you to enter your password so you can execute the command with root privileges.\n\nA: It is not a good idea to become the owner of a system file/directory! So, if you want to edit a system file, it is not necessary to be the owner of that file. Just use in terminal:\nsudo -i            # to grant access as root\ngedit file_name    # or /path/to/file/file_name\n\nAfter you finished to edit your file, press Ctrl+D in terminal to exit from root session.\nBut to become the owner of a file/directory, use chown. For example:\nsudo chown your_username file_or_directory\nCheck man chown and man chmod for more information.\n\nA: Rare case (but it was mine): The file system may be mounted read-only. This may happen unexpectedly due to a disk / kernel problem.\n", "Q: emacs when run from the Applications menu (via. desktop setting) doesn't load environment variables So when I invoke emacs from the terminal, all my environment variables are loaded correctly from .bashrc.\nHowever, when I load emacs from the Ubuntu Application menu (by invoking the /usr/share/applications/emacs24.desktop) it loads no environment variables. Can I adjust the desktop setting to do so?\n\nA: .bashrc is not the right place to define environment variables, as you've discovered. This file is only read when you start an interactive shell (specifically, only when you start an interactive instance of bash, not of other shells). The environment is then inherited by the processes started from that shell (each process has its own environment, inherited from its parent process). So if you start a program directly from the GUI, it never had a chance to see these environment variables.\nDefine environment variables in ~/.profile or in ~/.pam_environment. Both files are read when you log in.\nFor more information, see Alternative to .bashrc and What's the best distro/shell-agnostic way to set environment variables?\n", "Q: Keyboard shutcuts not working on Xubuntu My keyboard shortuts no longer work (FOr example Super T for termanal super r for run etc)\nIve found a few help threads online including here) \nAfter Xubuntu 10.04 to 10.10 upgrade, my keyboard shortcuts no longer work\nI get \"Command not found\" for that\nIve deleted my ./cache/sessions/* \nIve reset my keyboard shortcuts any other suggestions ?\n\nA: This looks like it could be bug #1292290 - Window manager keybindings don't work after reboot. A workaround is mentioned there:\nI found a workaround: clear before reassign!\n\nTo make a shortcut to work ok, select an action you want to reassign and click 'Clear' button until it will really empty. Sometime if there is some (hidden?) duplicates, you will still see some shortcut (the same or different), even you clicked 'Clear' button. In this case just click the button again. Since the action shortcut is really empty, just assign your custom one as usual, and it will work ok :)\n\nAnd\nSomeone on #xubuntu or #ubuntustudio (can't remember) mentioned a workaround for this:\n\nYou simply have to delete the current key mapping twice before setting a new one. Then the new mapping will be stored in the config.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. Found out that when I go to Setting - Settings manager - Session and startup - Advanced and turn on Launch Gnome services at startup, all of the shortcuts begin working again. What confused the issue: every time I logged in, Orca and Onboard would turn on. Seems to be a bug. As I don't use these, I uninstalled them.

I'm pretty sure that Ubuntu needs at least 1gb of ram.\n\nA: 512MB of RAM is no good for graphical installations. Consider upgrading the RAM to at least 2GB and you will love using Ubuntu.

Don't worry, it's not going to break things.\nBTW: It is recommended to use Ksplice uptrack (free for Ubuntu and Fedora) to keep your running kernel up to date (it only supports release kernels from official repository though).\nFor example, the default kernel for a Ubuntu Server 12.04 is 3.2.0-23, ksplice can apply the security patches (auto or uptrack-upgrade -y) to the running kernel without rebooting, so the effective kernel running (uptrack-uname -a) is actually 3.2.0-53.\n\n\nA: You should have something like this:\nlinux-header-x.x.x.x\nlinux-header-x.x.x.x-generic (possiably generic-pae or i686)\nlinux-image-x.x.x.x\nIf they are the same version I suggest you leave them but if they are different versions it is ok to leave just the ones you use now.\nFrom what I know a generic kernel is used by any driver that needs headers or modules for \nthe current kernel knows how to find the appropriate data.\nHope I was clear enough.\n", "Q: Are their any book cataloguing apps for Ubuntu? I'm trying to transition from most webapps to desktop apps (partly due to pernicious overseas three-letter agencies), but I can't find any replacement for the book-managment site Goodreads.\nI don't own any ebooks (my collection is paper-only), so from what I gather Calibri won't be much use to me; I want an app purely for cataloguing my book collection, though additional features are welcome.\nDesired Features\nThe features that a suitable app might have (not all are strictly required):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability to add and catagorise books.\n\n*Access to that data, either directly or by exporting to json | md | xml.\n\n*Metadata download from an online metadata API (amazon, goodreads).\n\n*Book recommendations based on my collection.\n\n*Gnome integration.\n\n\nDo any suitable apps available for Linux? Any app even remotely converging on these features would be helpful. \nI found a similar question, but it was more specifically about Greek language integration. \nWhat Book-Library  Organizing Programs are available?\nIf my question needs refinement or additional information please leave a comment below.\nThanks.\n\nA: Tellico is the best!\n\nTellico capabilities include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*creation of user-defined custom collections with unlimited fields,\n  \n*automatically formatted names,\n  \n*sorting and filtering by any field or property,\n  \n*ISBN validation,\n  \n*full customization for printing or display through XSLT files,\n  \n*import and export of CSV, RIS, BibTeX and BibTeXML files,\n  \n*import data from Amazon, IMDb, CDDB or any US-MARC compliant z39.50 server,\n  \n*tellico files are stored in XML format, avoiding the need for a database server, and allowing other software applications to use the\n  data.\n  \n\n\n", "Q: Once ubuntu is installed, can I still update other operating systems? Right now, I am a newbie almost ready to install ubuntu alongside windows 8 on my laptop soon, and have gone through most of the things I need to plan. Lately, I noticed that Microsoft is preparing Windows 8.1 as a free update to windows 8 users. What I would like to know, is when I install ubuntu on my computer, will I still be able to update windows to 8.1 (Same goes for other operating systems if I ever decide to install other distros)? I definitely will want the update to Windows 8.1 instead of Windows 8, so I need to know if I need to wait until 8.1 is released, or if I can go ahead and install ubuntu right now.\nThe bottom line is: Will I be able to upgrade Windows 8 to 8.1 with ubuntu installed on my system, or do I need to remove it in order to do that?\n\nA: An update should be possible. The only problem I can think of, is that Windows might overwrite your bootloader. In this case, you would have to manually reinstall Grub with a live disk to obtain your dual-bootable system. This process is explained here. Boot-repair is a very-easy-to-use GUI tool to do this.\nAs it has not been released yet, no one can guarantee this. It would be best for you to wait a few day after it has been released and read some feedback of fellow Ubuntu users.\n\nA: Microsoft Windows 8.1 will be available from Windows Update. This will not damage the MBR or boot loader. You can upgrade safely without having to worry about reinstalling Grub or fixing Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Cannot install ubuntu 11.04 apps on live usb I have ubuntu 11.04 on a 3.6gb usb flash drive.

I am forced to go to the website for the repository and download .deb files and install, windows style. \nWhat is the reason for this ? Maybe i am using an old ubuntu version and the repo is shut ?\nThanks.\n\nA: \nMaybe i am using an old ubuntu version and the repo is shut ?\n\nThat would be correct. 11.04 is an EOL (End Of Life) Ubuntu release. Unless you want to add the repositories back, use a later version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I would also suggest downloading 13.04 on your computer and using that instead.

My problem happens with most of the default programs (LibreOffice, Firefox, Software Center, etc.) and with one downloaded program called MuseScore.  What happens is when I click the top bar (Where minimize, maximize, close are) the windows goes to the backgound and doesn't do what I clicked on.  This is especially frustrating when another window is behind it, because then that window closes.  I am currently using the Cairo Dock session, but the problem ocurs on the Gnome Fallback as well (the default Ubuntu session has been dead since upgrade and is at a point of no return).

Am I expecting to much as in simplicity or would I have to do major programming? \nI have seen something that is similar to what i wish to do, using tint2 for a taskbar, this might be simpler if theres a way to edit this with its own theme.\n\nA: I found a way, using the latest version of Wine, I can install Rainmeter, a better Windows Conky Alternative, and do everything I wish to do. Its easier to program (since I'm used to the program on my other PCs). Unfortunately if you wish to copy my work, at the current time you can only install Rainmeter 1.3 or lower, anything higher will crash as you attempt to open the program (may work differently on your installation).

I have created a little server on Ubuntu 13.10, I've shared certain folders using SAMBA.\nOn my WINDOWS PC my username and password is the same as the username and password of the server, so I'm assuming that's why I can connect there, but connecting to the server from my brothers pc is a different story. \nI have added to /etc/sudoers :\njinglez ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\nThinking that when he try's to map a new network drive, that he then would be able to login as jinglez and the server password, but this didn't work, however when we created a new user account on his pc, with the above info it did, does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: The sudoers file is not used by samba to control user access. This will depend on your Samba configuration, but most samba configurations have the line\nsecurity = user which requires every user to have an account on your Ubuntu server. So you will have to add the user jinglez to the system (you can use the sudo adduser command to create this). \nOnce you've added the user to the system, you'll also have to add them to Samba's user list with the smbpasswd tool. Finally, to ensure they have permission to read/write the shares, be sure to add them to the same group as your original user and set the directory's group ownership to that. For more instructions you can refer to this answer: Samba and User Acount Passwords.\nRemember to restart your samba service with sudo service samba restart to apply.\nIf you don't want to create a new user account for your brother there are other options (you can set security on the \"share\" level, or even do advanced stuff like changing the PAM module Samba uses for authentication) but this is the simplest way. \n", "Q: Will AWLL6077v2 Wireless N 300 USB Adapter Will AWLL6077v2 Wireless N 300 USB Adapter\nwork with ubuntu running in dual-boot on a Macbook pro OSX 10.8?\nThe embedded chipset in AWLL6077v2 is Realtek RTL8192SU\nI can get support driver for Unix (Linux) from Realtek for\n       Linux Kernel 2.6.18~2.6.38 and Kernel 3.0.2\n       Android 1.6~2.3 and 4.0\nQuestion: will these drivers run on ubuntu 12.04 and/or ubuntu 13 kernels\n\nA: Yes they will work with Ubuntu kernel versions of Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.04.

I want to find out who is causing it to spin up so I can either move its stuff back or tell it to stop.\n\nA: You can use find to find out which files have been accessed. E.g. find /hdd/mount/path -cmin -15 will show you the files accessed in the last 15 minutes. Of course you have to enter the right path where your HDD is mounted. Otherwise it will look for files in the whole system. Maybe this gives you a hint. If you have no idea what process accessed the files, you can also find out exactly.\nAnother tool that could be usefull is iotop. You have to install it first:\nsudo apt-get install iotop\n\nThen you can run\nsudo iotop -m /hdd/mount/path\n\nto see which processes are accessing a specific mount path or\nsudo iotop -f /path/to/file\n\nto see which processes are accessing a specific file.

Steam installs apps into a user's home folder. This means when a user installs an app, a different user has to install the same app again.\nWhat's the most convenient way to share Steam apps?\nMy best idea is to have a one user who will have the main folder with read-write permissions for others and just have other users symlink to it. I'm not even sure if this will work. Is there a cleaner solution or one suggested by Valve?\n\nA: Steam supports using multiple game library folders by default, you could just create a folder which all users can read/write to then add this folder as a library for both users. Both users will have to maintain a separate copy of the Steam client and update it, the library includes the games themselves only.\n(source)\nYou could create a main folder in a read/write location and have a symlink at ~/.local/share/Steam to this folder, which should work hypothetically, but I haven't tried that. This will all users use the exact same Steam files.\nYou can also have a look at bindfs, note that it is not nearly the \"most convenient way\"\n\nA: My solution:\nsudo mkdir -p /opt/steam\nsudo setfacl -m default:other:rwX -R /opt/steam\nsudo setfacl -m other:rwX -R /opt/steam\n\nIf you move any games from another library, you'll need to repeat those commands.\nThe first command creates the directory intended to be used as the \"shared library\" of games. The second command will ensure that the default permissions in that directory allow all users to read and write any files. The third command changes the permissions to add read/write access for any existing files in that directory (in case it already existed).\n", "Q: Problem when installing Anki: unmet dependencies I'm trying to install Anki SRS http://ankisrs.net/ on (freshly-installed) Ubuntu 13.04, but it isn't going swiftly:\n\n The following packages have unmet dependencies:\n anki: Depends: python (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but 2.7.3-0ubuntu2.2 is to be installed\n Depends: python-qt4 (>= 4.4) but 4.9.1-2ubuntu1 is to be installed\n Depends: python-simplejson (>= 1.7.3) but 2.3.2-1 is to be installed\n\n\nWhat can I do to resolve this issue?\n\nA: I believe what's happening is dpkg package.deb does not install dependencies automatically.

I'm new to this ubuntu 13.04 so in terminal i allways need to start my xampp as a root so please help me i wanna convert my current account as an administrator(root) user.\n\nA: First things first. You should not work and run your desktop as root. Full stop. It is a bad, bad idea. Especially if you want to run a web server. Forget about it. It is easy enough to do it: set a root password (sudo -i ; then: passwd) and log in as user root. But don't do it, there are better ways around it.\nTo start a web server (and xampp is just a bundle containing a web server, sql server and a few other things that you could have installed on your machine easily with your package manager), you need root privileges for a brief moment only. This is why you use sudo -- to become root for just the moment when your run the command. For example, if you have followed these instructions to install xampp, you can just run\nsudo /opt/lampp/lampp start\n\nIf you are tired of typing in commands, create a desktop shortcut as described in the link above. If you are tired of typing in the password, edit your sudoers file. Type\nsudo visudo\n\nAnd at the end of that file, add the following line:\nhumanth ALL = NOPASSWD: /opt/lampp/lampp\n\n(assuming that you start lampp as above and that humanth is your user name).\nFurthermore, did you even read the Linux XAMPP HOWTO? It shows very clearly how to set up XAMPP as a service, so that you do not need to start it manually. In esssence, you just link the /opt/lampp/lampp script to /etc/init.d.\nsudo -i\ncd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d\nln -s /opt/lampp/lampp S99lampp\nln -s /opt/lampp/lampp K01lampp\n\n", "Q: \"module load\" command does not work I'm trying to compile the \"Global Climate Model\" with the following commands.\nmodule unload pgi gcc\nmodule load gcc/4.6.3 pgi/11.8\n\nWhen I execute them, the terminal replies with command not found.\nWhat am I doing wrong? What is the right way to do this?\n\nA: For those who \"skim\" (looking at you Seth):  This is NOT A QUESTION ABOUT KERNEL MODULES.  It's a question about manipulating shell environment variables using a tool called ENIRONMENT-MODULES.  If you're at all familiar with kernel modules, you'll realize there is no standard kernel tool (script or otherwise) named \"module.\"  All the module manipulation tools abbreviate module as mod (lsmod, insmod, modprobe, etc).  And there is no module named gcc. \nEnvironment-modules (http://modules.sourceforge.net/) is yet another environment tool for switching execution environments in the shell. It helps people who need Python 2.4 and Python 2.7 on the same machine. Or it helps people manage Intel v. GNU compilers and libraries.\nUnfortunately, environment-modules isn't a package for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nOptions include installing from source (follow the link above), upgrading to 14.04 LTS, or looking at deb files. Of the three, I'd install from source. The deb file depends on libtcl8.6 which is in the same predicament, unavailable on 12.04LTS.\n\nA: You're probably trying to use a software package that isn't installed on your machine. Of course I can't really be sure, but my guess would be that you're trying to use environment-modules. If that is correct, you could install environment-modules from the standard Ubuntu repositories. \nBut be aware that environment-modules is a rather old program. The homepage notes the last update of a helper tool as of 2011, the copyright notice doesn't go further up than 1999. So there's no guarantee that this software package works flawlessly with current Ubuntu versions. It might, but you can't be sure.\n\nA: Just to summarize the previous comments and answers and add a bit of first-hand installation experience:\nYou are looking for the module command provided by the Environment Modules package. It is a tool for modifying the shell environment (PATH but also aliases etc.) and common to many multi-user clusters like High-Performance Computing clusters. \nThe instructions you got were probably from some HPC cluster, since you want to run a global climate model. Read more about Environment Modules on HPC here.\nNow for something actually Ubuntu-related: It is actually not that much of a pain to set up Environment Modules under Ubuntu. I just did it in under 10 minutes for Ubuntu 14.10 and the Bash shell.\nAs mentioned in other posts, you can install Environment Modules from the repos (package environment-modules). \nThen you run add.modules. It will put a few lines into your shell initalization file, in this case ~/.bashrc:\ncase \"$0\" in\n          -sh|sh|*/sh)  modules_shell=sh ;;\n       -ksh|ksh|*/ksh)  modules_shell=ksh ;;\n       -zsh|zsh|*/zsh)  modules_shell=zsh ;;\n    -bash|bash|*/bash)  modules_shell=bash ;;\nesac\nmodule() { eval `/usr/Modules/$MODULE_VERSION/bin/modulecmd $modules_shell $*`; }\n#module() { eval `/usr/bin/modulecmd $modules_shell $*`; }\n\nYou need to uncomment the last line and comment out or delete the second-last. This line defines the module command you were looking for. It effectively runs modulecmd bash plus the arguments you give it.\nI have the feeling that this function is actually not very safe because it evaluates anything you supply it with in its arguments. Some users can perhaps comment on how to improve this.\nYou now just need to create some directory containing the so-called modulefiles and add it to $MODULEPATH, for example with module use /path/to/your/modulefiles. There are examples for modulefiles out there on the interwebs.\nI find this a very handy tool not just for multi-user clusters. I use it for switching between different Python distributions.\n\nA: It's not a case of module load not working, module load isn't a standard command in Ubuntu.\nIf you're trying to load an existing module, sudo modprobe <modulename> is the command you're looking for. And you can use rmmod or modprobe -r to unload a module.\n\nA: simply add this to the first line of your script. Then the module command will be read by tsch.\n#!/bin/tcsh\n\n", "Q: How to install drivers for brother printer Just installed Ubuntu 12.04LTS.

I am running an algorithm that regularly prints data on the terminal.\nUnfortunately the terminal only shows a limited number of lines, the others are no longer accessible.\nAre they deleted or can I recover the data?\n\nA: I don't think that this is possible. There are a number of solutions (workarounds), however.

Otherwise, the data does not exist. One way of solving the problem would be to direct the algorithm result to a textfile ,make the algorithm a cron job, then at regular intervals, you can use cat textfile to view the data.

Below is an example that should work for you:\nfind . -type f -name '*.*' -print0 | \nwhile IFS= read -r -d '' file; do\n    printf '%s\\n' \"$file\"\ndone\n\nThis way you delimit the filenames with null (\\0) characters, this means that variation in space and other special characters will not cause problems.\nIn order to update an archive with the files that find locates, you can pass its output directly to tar:\nfind . -type f -name '*.*' -printf '%p\\0' | \ntar --null -uf archive.tar -T -\n\nNote that you do not have to differentiate between if the archive exists or not, tar will handle it sensibly. Also note the use of -printf here to avoid including the ./ bit in the archive.\n\nA: In addition to proper quoting, you can tell find to use a NULL separator, and then read and process the results in a while loop\nwhile read -rd $'\\0' file; do\n    something with \"$file\"\ndone < <(find  . -type f -name '*.*' -print0)\n\nThis should handle any filenames that are POSIX-compliant - see man find\n   -print0\n          True; print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a null character (instead of the newline character that  -print  uses).   This  allows  file\n          names that contain newlines or other types of white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the find output.  This option corresponds to the\n          -0 option of xargs.\n\n\nA: This works and is simpler:\nfind . -name '<pattern>' | while read LINE; do echo \"$LINE\" ; done\n\nCredit to Rupa (https://github.com/rupa/z) for this answer.\n\nA: I think you may be better off using find's -exec option.\nfind . -type f -name '*.*' -exec tar -cpf archive.tar {} +\n\nFind then executes the command using a system call, so that spaces and newlines are preserved (rather a pipe, which would require quoting of special characters).  Note that \"tar -c\" works whether or not the archive already exists, and that (at least with bash) neither {} nor + need to be quoted.\n\nA: I did something like this to find files that may contain spaces.\nIFS=$'\\n'\nfor FILE in `/usr/bin/find $DST/shared -name *.nsf | grep -v bookmark.nsf | grep -v names.nsf`; do\n    file $FILE | tee -a $LOG\ndone\n\nWorked like a charm :)\n\nA: Try quoting the for loop like this:\nfor FILE in \"`find . -type f  -name '*.*'`\"   # note the quotation marks\n\nWithout quotes, bash doesn't handle spaces and newlines (\\n) well at all...\nAlso try setting\nIFS=$'\\n'\n\n\nA: find . <find arguments> -print0 | xargs -0 grep <pattern>\n\n\nA: As minerz029 suggested, you need to quote the expansion of the find command. You also need to quote all the substitutions of $FILE in your loop.\nfor FILE in \"$(find . -type f  -name '*.*')\"\ndo\n    if [ ! -f archive.tar ]; then\n        tar -cpf archive.tar \"$FILE\"\n    else \n        tar -upf archive.tar \"$FILE\" \n    fi\ndone\n\nNote that the $() syntax should be preferred to the use of backticks; see this U & L question. I also removed the [[ keyword and replaced it by the [ command because it's POSIX.\n\nA: Most answers here break if there is a newline character in the filename. I use the bash more then 15 years, but only interactive.\nIn Python you can us os.walk(): http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk\nAnd the tarfile module: http://docs.python.org/2/library/tarfile.html#tar-examples\n\nA: I had a similar problem in a script I used to convert audio files.

It's coded in python so it integrates well with most python libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, or even pytorch and tensorflow for AI and ML. It also lets you script your models via python notebook if you prefer.\n", "Q: Keep the titlebar of Nautilus in Gnome Shell when maximized (Gnome Shell, 13.04, Upgraded, Gnome 3.8 )\nExcept for Nautilus all applications have a title bar when maximized.\nI want the title bar with close button, even when nautilus is maximized.\nThis is exactly the opposite of this question.\n\nA: installing this extension ignore_request_hide_titlebar worked.\n", "Q: Windows in Virtualbox show error Ex80070057 when copying files from a network share I encountered this problem after installing 13.04.

You can usually fix this problem by typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda; however, you should be very sure that you're not currently using software RAID. If you erase RAID data when the system is actually using RAID, the result can be problems accessing your disk at all.\n\n*A damaged partition table -- The libparted library (upon which the Ubuntu installer relies) is extremely sensitive to partition table problems. If any exist, it usually reports the disk as being empty. My FixParts program (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) will correct many of these problems in an automatic or semi-automatic mannger; see its Web page for details. Other problems may require more specialized and manual repairs. If you think this is the source of the problem and if FixParts can't fix it or if you're wary of using FixParts, post the output of sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda.

Problem solved!\n\nA: I had a similar problem trying to install Ubuntu (via USB) alongside Windows 10: the Ubuntu installer did not recognize my SSD and only found the USB drive I was installing from. It turned out to be because I had RAID enabled for the SSD. I tried disabling RAID in the BIOS but then Windows would not boot.\nAfter some searching around, I found a website with instructions on how to disable RAID in Windows: http://triplescomputers.com/blog/uncategorized/solution-switch-windows-10-from-raidide-to-ahci-operation/. Here is a summary of the instructions to the best of my understanding:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into windows, and set a flag to boot into Safe Mode on the next restart.\n\n*Reboot and enter the BIOS settings to disable RAID.\n\n*Exit BIOS settings and boot to Windows. Windows will boot into Safe Mode automatically.\n\n*Clear the flag to boot into Safe Mode, so the system will boot into normal mode.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nAfter disabling RAID by following the instructions on that website, Windows worked with RAID disabled, and I was able to install Ubuntu successfully.\n\nA: When I'm attempting to install Linux Mint 19 instead of pre-installed Windows 10 on my Dell G7 15 I stacked with a similar problem. \nI spend much time trying to change BIOS options. I've tried to enable Legacy External Devices, and Enable Legacy Option ROMs with Enable Attempt Legacy Boot. I've enabled/disabled PTT Security, but without any success.\nBut what I do next, solved my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot my computer and press F12 several times, this should run BIOS boot settings.\n\n*Select BIOS setup.\n\n*Go to General - Boot Sequence, in Boot list option select UEFI.\nscreenshot #1\n\n*Next, go to System Configuration - SATA Operation and select AHCI or Disabled. screenshot #2\n\n*Click Apply button and Exit.\n\n\nAfter that Linux Live ISO should recognize your SSD.

One is to make cron notify you of the results of commands it runs. Specifically, the crontab(5) man page states that\n\ncron(8) will look at MAILTO if it has any reason to send mail as a\n  result of running  commands  in  ``this''  crontab.  If MAILTO is\n  defined (and non-empty), mail is sent to the user so named.\n\nJust put a line like the following in the head of your crontab file:\nMAILTO=username@domain.com\n\nAlternatively, if you want a more specialized solution, you can create a script and put it in place where it is guaranteed to be found (like /bin). The script itself would check whether the actual script is present, if yes, run it, if not, send you a notification. Something along the following lines:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmyscript=/path/to/your/script\nmyemail=username@server.org\n\nif [ -f \"$myscript\" ] ; then\n    exec \"$myscript\"\nelse\n    mail -s \"Error running $myscript\" $myemail <<EOF\nThere was an error running the script\n$myscript\nThe script could not be found\nEOF\nfi\n\nYou could even make it generic:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmyscript=$1\nshift 1\nparams=$*\nmyemail=username@server.org\n\nif [ -f \"$myscript\" ] ; then\n    exec \"$myscript $*\"\nelse\n    mail -s \"Error running $myscript\" $myemail <<EOF\nThere was an error running the script\n$myscript\nThe script could not be found\nEOF\nfi\n\n\nA: cron does this for you already. Your crontab entry says:\n00 01 * * * sh /backup/script.sh\n\nAt the scheduled time, cron will execute the command you specified and email you its output.\nThe output of sh /does/not/exist is: sh: 0: Can't open /does/not/exist. So this is what cron will email you if the file does not exist.\nYou may need to make sure your system is configured correctly for email, so that cron is able to email you successfully. You mentioned sendmail; if sendmail is configured correctly, and emailing your user works, then cron will work, too.\nThe MAILTO variable can also help if you need to email a different address, or if emailing your user does not work, but emailing a specific Internet email address does. Just add the line MAILTO=foo@example.com above the existing line.\n\nA: Well, you will need another script. Something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfile=\"/path/to/script.sh\"\n\n# if script.sh exists and is executable.\nif [ -x $file ]; then\n    # execute script.sh\n    sh /path/to/script.sh\nelse \n    #send mail\n    echo \"script.sh doesn't exists or is not executable\" | sendmail me@example.com\nfi\n\n", "Q: mkfs.ntfs is not found, through the ntfs-3g package is installed I'm trying to format a USB stick to NTFS file system with the mkfs.ntfs command and I get this in Terminal:\nhorbuli@BOSS:~$ sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\nReading package lists...

That file may be mounted with the loop option and will look like a whole filesystem, with parts missing.  The present parts are the changes made, so your files should be in /mnt//home//...

What are my options for setting up my laptop with Ubuntu with even more space \nI'd like to have a dual partition with 300GB ubuntu and the rest Windows.\n\nA: If you mean having 2 partitions, one for each OS, I recommend the use of a live USB or CD and reducing the size of the original ext4 partition, now, you'll end up having some unallocated space, what you'll do is that you'll set it up a an NTFS and install windows there.\nIt would be my personal recommendation to create not 1, but 2 NTFS partitions, the reason is that you can back up your data in a NTFS partition (movies, files, etc), without depending on a OS for managing that, you could have dual boot with Ubuntu, windows, and all your data in another partition, and in case something happens and you need a clean install, you won't loose all of your data.\nHope this answer suits you friend, let us know how it was.\nNote: When i mean use a live USB or CD, i mean if you have the USB or Ubuntu CD, you just put it in your computer and boot from it, and select the option live (like for testing it), that will give you access to Gparted and then you can do what you need to do, sorry if I wasn't specific here.\n", "Q: Installing Mozart or other software with Wine from very new user of Ubuntu, with Wine installed too.\n I have \"Mozart\" music notation software, on a CD.

I guess it does make sense to create a swap and root partition in addition to a big home partition (But I am not very experienced with Linux). Since the space is limited until I'm able to completely remove Windows, I want to assign a reasonable small root partition. For Ubuntu I read 8-10GB. What size would you recommend for Lubuntu? With 1GB Ram I will create a Swap of 1GB and the rest as Home. \n\nA: Yes. If you don’t install many apps, 8 GB is enough for Lubuntu. Conseidering that settings and apps user data are stored under home partition, Lubuntu File System takes 2-3 GB at the beginning; you add extra 5 GB for apps and a room for breathing. (Once I myself installed Lubuntu on a 80 GB harddisk, made a 10-GB partition for File System.)\nIn the case of 1 GB RAM you won’t need much than 1 GB SWAP – Lubuntu itself takes less than 100 MB on startup.\n\nA: Do not bother creating any sub-partions, they just consume space. During install create only a single root partion and install everything there without swap. You can add swap files as needed later if you really need them (normally you do not).\n", "Q: Read lpstat output in reverse order?

on private key (client) or authorized_keys (server side).\nPlease make sure the following\n\n\n*\n\n*client side: mode bits of ~/.ssh => 0700, logged in user has read access to the private key, e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa mode bits 0600\n\n*server side: mode bits of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys => 0600\nIf it is still not working, try to run sshd (server side) in debug mode in foreground /usr/sbin/sshd -Dd\nConnect to the sshd \nssh user@host -vvv\nSee output from both side, you should be able to see the files causing the problem and fix.\n", "Q: Bootable Version on USB drive I downloaded the files through this website onto my flashdrive and am wondering how to boot it up?\n\nA: Just copying the files onto the flash drive can’t help booting. You need to make a bootable USB with special applications. \nFirst download the ISO file from the Ubuntu site, then create a bootable drive:\nHow to create a bootable USB stick on Windows?\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nHow to create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu?\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\n", "Q: Failed to dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 alongside with Windows 8 I had 7 or 8 tries in the past two days to install ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop with windows 8 pre-installed. I encountered a series of problems and I found some of them exist in other versions (such as Ubuntu 13.04 with windows 7) systems too.\nHere is a list of problems I had:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since I installed ubuntu 12.04 with a live CD, it wasn't detecting Windows 8, which I believe it should do. Install guide provided two options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Erase the hard drive and install Ubuntu;\n\n*Other options.\n\n*(Sometimes also detecting installed ubuntu system while sometimes not.)\n\n\n*After installing Ubuntu, there was no grub menu to choose. And I installed grub-customizer for checking - no entry for windows system as expected apparently for the problem 1.\n\n*Install and run boot-repair will fix a part of the problem, but there would be 2 possible results:\n\n\n*\n\n*we get both entries for ubuntu and windows 8, and all seems running well. But after once or twice reboot, computer will show\n\n\n\"no such disk: xxxx  grub rescue>\";\nAn artical said this happens when enable both EFI mode and Legacy mode then I switched off legacy mode, which didn't help.\n\n\n*\n\n*here we get an entry for windows in grub menu, but no entry for ubuntu anyway.\n\n\n*nvidia-current cannot be installed by system recommend for some reasons (I think) as lack of source/headers by default, so need to run sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic to fix;\n\n\nMy laptop has one hard disk (/dev/sda) and it's not possible to install grub2 by additional command /dev/sda (returns error message). And also reports warning \"The boot file is too far from head of disk, your system probably will not detect it\", then suggests partition for /boot (which I'm sure I had such one partition).\nNow I removed ubuntu from windows, and encountered \"grub-rescue\" when reboot. Then I rebooted and switched on \"secure boot\", it boots directly into windows now.\nJust for a few more, when installing ubuntu, I had UEFI settings as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure boot: disabled;\n\n*Legacy support: enabled by default, and disabled it after several tries;\n\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why ubuntu install system didn't detect Windows 8? (it also happens in installing version 13.04)\n\n*How to fix the problem happens with grub? (replace it or fix it? and why it happened?)\n\n*Will it be possible to dual boot ubuntu alongside with windows on exactly one disk?\nThanks a lot.\n\nrun \"lsblk\" in \"try ubuntu\":\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bww7veh5_yCEeWhiRTdLcWt3YW8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nA: Laptops shipping with Windows 8 most probably use UEFI instead of BIOS (here are a bunch of differences).\nAs I myself have a Lenovo laptop with UEFI, I would recommend first to search for an option in the UEFI menu that would look like \"Legacy support\". This, in simple words, would make UEFI support BIOS features and solve a lot of problems that may arise. You can enter the UEFI menu just the way you used to enter to BIOS (laptop dependent, try out F2, F1, ESC or DEL keys while booting up - manufacturer logo).\nIf the above is not the case, you may want to refer to the Ubuntu Wiki UEFI page and try out the various options listed there.\n", "Q: Kubuntu UEFI Dual Boot with Windows 7 failed at installing Grub-efi I want to install Kubuntu 13.04 together with Windows 7 in UEFI Mode. I installed Windows 7 first, which created the EFI boot partition.\nWhen it come to installing Kubuntu, the installation failed when trying to install Grub-efi on sda with the error that grub-efi install to /target/ failed.\nThere is a simliar thread with the same problem but on 12.04:\nWhy 12.04 Fails to install grub-efi to /target/?\n..and the solution was to use 12.10. But I'm using a newer version of (k)ubuntu.\nAny Solutions here are highly welcome.\nUpdate:\nIt also doesn't work with just kubuntu on the disk,  so it's definitely not a dual boot issue. \nSolved:\nI used 12.10 and the installation succeded without any problem except that grub didn't add Windows. Fix that with boot-repair.\nI found a Kubuntu Bug entry which says, that it's probably a kernel Bug in 13.04.\n\nA: If the installation has mostly finished, but just failed on the GRUB installation, I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try Boot-Repair, which should set up GRUB for you.\n\n*Try the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd. If that gets Linux booted, you can then install the Debian package version, which with any luck will install without error to the hard disk.\n\n", "Q: Problem with unity after latest update You see after the last update all my GUI is not working: I don't have launcher or top panel menu and no window arrows are showed to. I tried to reset Unity setting by using dconf-tool   and tried to reinstall Unity, but nothing helps.\n\nA: Well, to my experience, (I’ve destroyed my Unity twice ever!) there’s an inappropriate graphical update. Do you add any PPA for Unity which may contain an update for nux, for example? Anyway, all you need is (1) detect what causes the problem, and (2) remove the experimental/unsupported packages and/or add the default ones.\nSo, for now, open a Terminal using Ctrl+Alt+T, and type software-center to open Ubuntu Software Center. Then go to History and see what packages are upgraded or removed. Edit your question and write them down or make a screenshot if possible.\nIf you added a PPA, purging the PPA would be the simplest way possible through ppa-purge. You need to install it first: sudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 8 on Samsung 530U (500GB+24GB) I have Samsung 530U (model NP530U3C-A06CZ), which has 500GB HDD + 24GB SSD.\nI would like to have dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 + Windows 8, but I don't know how I can do it.\nAccording to my information both (Windows and Ubuntu) should boot from HDD and the 24 GB SSD disc is only for ExpressCache.\nBut I don't know: \n\n\n*\n\n*how to install ExpressCache for Windows 81 (there is no driver to download from Samsung support)\n\n*how to install both systems without a DVD-ROM\n\n*how to make the disc partition in order to keep the possibility for Windows to use ExpressCache\n\n*I also want to make a HDD partitioned to 3 parts (Windows, data, Ubuntu + SSD).\n\n\nIs there any way to do that without uninstalling Windows? If not, what's the correct procedure?\n1I am thinking about ExpressCache only for Windows, Ubuntu is fast enough.\n\nA: I'm not sure about SSD but if you want to dual boot, you need to provide at least a spare partition on your Windows 8 for use with Ubuntu.\nNext\nHow to create a bootable USB stick on Windows?\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nOnce you have the bootable Ubuntu installer on USB stick, boot up your machine with the USB stick and follow screen instructions. Make sure to only install Ubuntu on the spare partition you've created earlier.\nHope that helps :)\n\nA: This post which I wrote might help you to some extent to install Ubuntu on the SSD:\nhttp://menatronics.blogspot.in/2014/04/running-ubuntu-on-24gb-ssd-dual-boot.html\nBasically all you have to do is disable Intel SRT (if it's used) and then go to Windows power option and disable Windows 'FastBoot' option. You have to do this if you want write access to your NTFS drives. Then load the live DVD or USB and install Ubuntu to SSD. Mostly /dev/sdb (I'm not sure , just confirm it). Grub will take care of rest of the things.\nNow, \n\n\n*\n\n*You cannot use SSD as a cache for both Ubuntu and Windows. It's\njust not possible.\n\n*ExpressCache is only for Windows 8 and it's an OEM install, i.e. you cannot download it from any website.\n\n*There are several posts out there on how to use an SSD as a cache for Ubuntu, if you're planning to install Ubuntu to the HDD.\n\n", "Q: Full Ubuntu Flash Drive install won't boot So I installed Ubuntu (full version, not live) onto my 8gb USB flash drive.  When I start up my PC though and go through the boot options the flash drive doesn't show up as one.  I'm not really sure where to go from here.  Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: (1) Make sure that USB stick is inserted before entering BIOS. And consider that some computers list the USB drives under harddisk, so that one should change harddisk boot priorities to enable boot from USB.\n(2) How do you install Ubuntu on the USB flash? And consider that the flash will work only on the computer from which you installed Ubuntu on it. \n\nA: 1) Prior to creating your flash drive installation, confirm that the hashes match on the ISO you downloaded.\n2) Choose \"something else\" from the installer menu\n3) Install normally insuring that you are targeting the flash drive.\n4) Choose the flash device for the GRUB boot record installation.\nI've followed this approach many times with Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, and Mate.\nIf for some reason your new flash system doesn't boot, double check the hash for the ISO and replace it if the hash doesn't match and start over. If the hash matches, try to repair or reinstall grub.\nSource: Experience\n", "Q: Will installing Matlab on Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop open any ports? I was wondering if installing Matlab is somehow impacting the security of Ubuntu. I am really not an Ubuntu geek and do not know if installing Matlab on Ubuntu will open any ports? I am not using any firewall, since I am not familiar with it, but use my notebook also in a public WiFi.\nThanks for the suggestions\n\nA: Do not worry about MATLAB impacting the security of your Ubuntu installation, with regards to firewalls and public WiFi.\nMATLAB will open TCP ports for certain things (esp. to verify the license is valid,) depending on how it is configured and how it is used. Normally, MATLAB does not act as a network server, which is what most basic firewall configurations are concerned with.\nRunning MATLAB wihtout a firewall is not likely to be a security risk, unless your MATLAB script is accessing sensitive data from a remote location. If you work with sensitive data, and this is your concern... do not use public WiFi. A firewall will not help you in this case.\nIf you are concerned about your computer being compromised as a result of using MATLAB without a firewall, then you do not need to worry.\n", "Q: how can i use a domain to point to my server?

The 192.168.2.47 is a private ip address therefore you can't point your domain name A record into it.\n\nA: First. Go to Google and search whats my ip. It will show u what the ip to your router is.\nSecond. Go to where ever u bought your domain from and Pont it to the ip you got for your router.\nThird. Go into your router and into port forwarding(depends on router on what it is called). And forward to the ip of your servers local ip. And for the port use 80 on start and end port.\nThen when u type in your domain name( www.metrikcorp.com is mine that runs on my servers in my house.)it should take you to your server.\nP.S. depending on your internet provider and what kinda package you have with them. most internet providers block port 80 unless you have  business grade internet.\nYou will also need a http server(I use apache2) on that machine. \nHope this helps \n", "Q: Gnome-shell will not launch Ubuntu 13.04 When I log into the Gnome session, the shell does not launch.\nIn terminal I get the following:\npst007x@pst007x-Serval-Professional:~$ gnome-shell\nWindow manager warning: Screen 0 on display \":0\" already has a window manager; try using the --replace option to replace the current window manager.\npst007x@pst007x-Serval-Professional:~$ \n\nHow can I find the current window manager?\nIf I change the window manager will it break Unity?\nAny suggestion?\nThanks\nUbuntu 13.04 64bit\nGnome 3.8\nEDIT:\nRemoved Compiz and Unity, then Gnome-shell worked...

I would like to install Ubuntu on a fresh SSD that is currently not encrypted.\nMy current system contains (among others) an SSD, fully encrypted using Truecrypt on which Windows 8 is installed. \nHow would I go about installing Ubuntu without messing up the Truecrypt bootloader?\nI noticed there was a somewhat similar question here: Can Ubuntu be installed on Windows 7 drive that is encrypted with Truecrypt?\nbut it does not really answer the question on what to do when there already is a Truecrypt bootloader on the MBR. \nNeither does the question How can I dual-boot a TrueCrypt-encrypted Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 when both are installed separately on different physical drives?. \nI want to avoid issues with bootloaders, I don't really care which bootloader comes first, as long as I can boot into both systems. \nI'm hoping to be able to do this simply by making the right choices during installation.\n\nA: This is relatively simple. Following @hmayag advice will insure you don't accidentally overwrite the MBR on your Windows 8 drive. Install Ubuntu to your SSD and install grub to the MBR of the SSD. You will end up with 2 bootable systems after reinstalling your Windows 8 drive. (Both drives will have an active MBR) You can choose which to boot from through the BIOS, but I would set the boot order to the SSD as the first drive and reinstall grub2 as outlined here so that you can choose either system at boot time without adjusting boot order in the BIOS.\nYou can do this by making the right choices during installation as well and skip removing the Windows 8 drive but be absolutely certain that you install grub to the other drive (the \"fresh SSD\")\n", "Q: Automatic deletion of old backups in Sublime Text Using the disk analyzer to clean some garbage I found some (automatically made?) backups.

The Question \nHow can ubuntu be configured so that you don't got the \"waiting for network configuration...\" message at boot if you got more than one adapter? \nFacts\n\n\n*\n\n*I've got an untouched Ubuntu here in Virtual Box and In VM-Ware Workstation.\n\n*My /etc/network/interfaces file is untouched and I've activated a Nat adapter to use the host systems real network card.\n\n*Additionally I've activated a host only adapter to be able to use a separate IP for connections between the VM and the host system.\n\n\nDeduction\nI figured out that the interfaces file needs only one gateway entry and this is given trough \nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp.\nSo this is the entry for the first network adapter that provides gateway information and so the second configuration has no need for a line called \ngateway 192.168.1.1.\nFor me that means the second entry has to look like this:\naddress 192.168.217.131 \ndepending on what the router tells you as network address for the interface configured trough dcp and the second line here is the netmask. In common cases this is  \nnetmask 255.255.255.\nSo the entire `/etc/network/interfaces'-file looks like this:\n#This file describe the network interfaces available on your system\n#and how to activate them. For more information see interfaces(5).\n\n#The loopack network interface \n\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n#The primary network interface \n\n# ethernet 0\nauto eth0 \niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n\naddress 192.168.217.131\nnetmask 255.255.255\n\n#No need for gateway here because this is already provided by the dhcp entry.\n\nIn this example I've taken the IP address provided by Ubuntu's ^server (Basic Ubuntu Server) package what was 192.168.217.130 and increased it by one. \nNow I restart Ubuntu and got the message Waiting for network Configuration... where Ubuntu try to wait for network connection about 2 minutes.\nI've had the same on Virtual Box. \n\nA: There are two things to know\n\n\n*\n\n*As already mentioned above there is no need for a second gateway with a dhcp server in your network because the gateway entry is generated from there.\n\n*After you've added a host-onely adapter you have to copy the ip-adress from your windows host.\nSo far.\nHere is an example configuration for a host only connection with one additional adapter:\nauto eth1\n\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.253.128\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.253.1\nbroadcast 192.168.253.255\n\nThe Third block of the network line depends on your ip.\nthe broadcast line is needed for network communication between the host and the guest. This is a networking protocol related thing.\n\nA: If you want to connect your VM to your home network with deferent ip than host system then you should choose Bridge option.  In this advance options you need to choose allow to all  for communications between VM to host, Vm to Vm. \nYou need to choose Bridge connection for second Network Adapter. You also need to configure dns-nameservers and gateway as this Network Adapter is different from first. \nHere in your configuration file netmask should be \nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\n\nA: Something extra would be neccessary for networking to be up and running on some occasions. Providing dns-nameservers in /etc/network/interfaces file instead of '/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base' file. \nExample:\nauto eth1\n\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.217.131\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.217.1\nbroadcast 192.168.217.255\ngateway 'provide your gateway here might be necessary'\ndns-nameservers 'provide your nameserver here'\n\nFinally,\nsudo restart network-manager\n\n", "Q: I have no internet connection after upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10 I upgraded Ubuntu to 12.10.

I want my Launcher to be transparent, so I check \"Transparency\" in Unity tweak tool and... it's solid. When I uncheck the transparency button... it is transparency. I've made gif to show it clearly.\nHow to make the launcher fully transparent?\n\n\nA: Maybe a bug. Maybe it’s because CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager) uses Opacity instead, so when you set Transparency OFF, probably it sets the Opacity equal to 0; thus it’s transparent. So if you want to make it totally transparent, you should move the slider position once and then put it on the tranparency 100% and also choose black for custom color, otherwise, it won’t be fully transparent. Here’s some screenshots:\nTransparency 100% with a wallpaper-based color: it’s not transparent!\n\nTransparency 100% with white: it’s not transparent but rather shiny!\n\nTransparency 100% with black: it’s really transparent, but COF icon has a black background.\n\nTransparency OFF with black: the same result as transparency 100%. Turning the transparency off means 100% tranparency (Opacity OFF)!\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you make the Launcher transparent, you may also want to change Icon backgrounds to All applications. \n\n*The default value (correct position) for Launcher transparency is on the line about the middle of the range (40%).\n\nA: When setting transparency on, you have to adjust the transparency level with the slider just below the switch (on your screen capture it's at 100% so... plain solid indeed!) \nThen, the fact that the launcher is still transparent when transparency is unchecked might be a bug. If you open CompizConfig (module 'Ubuntu Unity Plugin', tab 'Launcher') and the Unity Tweak Tool at the same time, you can see that the opacity is updated to 0 (ie. invisible) in CompizConfig when you uncheck the transparency option in Unity Tweak Tool.\n", "Q: How to change phpmyadmin username from root to something else?

Is it possible to ensure Wine does not execute .exe files automatically? Thank you.\n\nA: When you install the wine package, it registers itself so that .exe files, if run from the command line, will \"auto run via wine\" if they match a specific signature and have executable bit set (like via chmod +x).\nTo prevent accidental direct execution of exes from console like\n/path/to/program.exe\n\nyou can setup binfmt_misc kernel module with the following command:\nsudo update-binfmts --disable wine\n\nThis will disable support for direct execution of files with magic MZ.\nCAVEAT: this appears to be undone on restart or Wine upgrade.\nIf you really want to get rid of it (until wine upgrade!), run\n sudo update-binfmts --package wine --remove wine /usr/bin/wine\n\n\nA: As far as I know, wine does NOT execute .exe files by default, based on my experience so far with Wine on Ubuntu 13.04.\nI'm not sure if previous Ubuntu/Wine versions allowed it automatically run executables, but at least you can be fairly certain that that is not currently the case.\n\nA: Wine does not run files automatically (poor wording choice on your part).\nHowever, if you want exe files to open with something else by default, you need to change the associated program for exe files to something other than Wine (you can do this from the properties window in Nautilus).\nTo run your program, you can create a .desktop file or simply use \"Open With\" from the context menu.\n\nA: *\n\n*Wine doesn't associate with .exe files by default on most systems, and depending on your installation, it 'may'.\nThe EASIEST way for you to do this would be to install the program Ubuntu Tweak, this can be downloaded from here: Ubuntu Tweak Download Instructions\nOnce you have it downloaded you simply open it up, change to Admins tab and then under System choose File Type Manager. Once in here select the file category Text and using shift-click and/or control-click select all of the file types you want, then click Edit on the bottom right. \nThis will allow you to multi-set the mimetype opener for all of the files.\nSee screen:\n\n\n*I believe that this is what you need in addition to the above point: How to prevent Wine from adding file associations?\nRef: how can I change file association globally?\n\nA: Wine doesn't run .exe files by default unless you add such an association rule. If you did, remove it from Nautilus properties.\n\nA: One option is to rename your wine executable, ex:\n sudo mv /usr/bin/wine /usr/bin/wine.disabled\n\nor the like.  Just remember to remove that or rename it if you remove the wine package :)\nSometimes configure scripts will still use \"wine64\" if it's present (and update-binfmts might not be enough of a work around), so you may need/want to rename that as well.\n\nA: I found the best way in the man page for binfmt.d.\nTo override a rule, create a symlink in /etc/binfmt.d to /dev/null with the same name.\nIn the case of wine, the package file is at /usr/lib/binfmt.d/wine.conf and can be overridden with \nsudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/binfmt.d/wine.conf\n\nThis change is permanent and will survive reboots and wine updates.\n", "Q: How to install xfce 4.12 on ubuntu 12.04 As per the question, how can I install xfce 4.12 on ubuntu 12.04 LTS (32-bit).\nI tried this ppa https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-dev/+archive/xfce-4.12\nBut there werent any upgrade packages after updating the repository. \n\nA: As per the PPA, you need to enable 4.10 PPA for 4.12\n\n\n*\n\n*ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.10\n\n*ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12\n\n\nDo\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.10\nadd-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12\nsudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade # if you have already installed xfce4\n\notherwise\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\n\nNOTE: make sure python-software-properties and software-properties-common are installed.\n\n", "Q: I removed compiz and now I can't login to Ubuntu I installed compiz a while ago and at some point to decided to remove it.

This resulted in the Ubuntu 14.04 login screen looping which led me to this posting.

I needed to run ccsm but ctrl-alt-t didn't work and I ended up getting a terminal by opening a folder on my desktop and navigating to /usr/share/applications to run the terminal. In ccsm I re-enabled the Unity plugin and after rebooting things were working again.  \nTo re-iterate, the problem is that Ubuntu needs Compiz to login and Unity to give you an interface. Unity is a plugin of Compiz and needs to be re-enabled. I used ccsm but there may be other ways such as using pico or some other text editor to edit Compiz configuration files directly.\n\nA: You can fix your system though the bootable flash drive. Go ahead and start it up, then get online do that you can access the internet normally. Next, you'll need to press Ctrl+Alt+T together, then enter in these commands, followed by enter:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nAt this point, the line you type at in the Terminal window will change. From here, you'll need to run this command to reinstall everything you need, followed by enter:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nOnce you're done, you can reboot your computer and boot it back into your installed Ubuntu. It should now let you log into your account.\n\nA: Start your computer, and once you reach the login screen press ctrl+alt+f1, you will be greeted with a text login, login and then type sudo apt-get install compiz once that is done type logout, and then press ctrl+alt+f7 to return to the graphical login.\n", "Q: Can't Purge X Updates PPA Because / is Treated as a Space? sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nI've tried running that command... several times.

A quick glance at the source reveals that it's printing a space where we'd normally type a slash:\nwarn \"Could not find package list for PPA: $PPAOWNER $PPANAME\"\n\nSo why couldn't it find the package list?\nI believe that part of the message is also misleading.

I used 'mcc' command in matlab(ubuntu) to create executable files.\nNow to run those executables I need to set the 'MCR' directory path to the environment variable. I used 'setenv' but, it says 'setenv is not found. the following is what I did-\nsetenv PATH/<mcr root path>/v7.17: \"$PATH\"\n\nAnd I get the following output-\nNo command 'setenv' found, did you mean command 'neten'\nfrom package 'netenv'\nsetenv: commmand not found \n\nCan you please help me telling how do I set the environment variable in ubuntu to run my executable files.\n\nA: The reason is that setenv is a *csh (e.g. tcsh) built in for setting environmental variables. There are different \"shells\" -- that is, programs which provide you with a command line, and they have different syntax. Most Linux distributions come with a pre-installed shell called bash, in which setting environmental variables requires a different syntax.\nIn bash, try\nexport PATH=$PATH:/what/ever/path/v7.17\n\n(export is usually unnecessary unless the PATH variable has not been set yet, which normally is not the case)\nAlternatively, install tcsh (sudo apt-get install tcsh), start tcsh from the command line and enter your original command.\nUpdate: the next error in line is that a shared library is missing. Probably you need to set up an environmental variable, $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, to point to where this library is. Find the directory where matlab keeps its shared libraries, and do\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/the/matlab/lib/directory/\n\nAlso, please take a look at this question (first hit when you google for \"shared library libmwi18n.so is not found\"): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10972819/mcr-libmwi18n-so-file-missing\n", "Q: How do I use dual monitors with Remmina Remote Desktop Client?

Not only user conf(that's easy), but also, all system configuration include ssh keys for remote servers ( really annoing config that each time), DB from mysql and etc.. \nLike system was only updated not, fresh installed. \n\nA: Yes and no. No, because in general switching the base distribution can influence many things -- for example, the distributions might have different versions of certain packages, and consequently use different, incompatible configuration files for certain services. There is hardly a way of doing it automatically.\nYes, because you can always find out what exactly it is that you have to configure each time and try to deal with it in a semi-manual way. For example, I'm not sure what you mean by \"ssh keys for remote servers\" -- I keep them in ~/.ssh/, so why should that change when the server is reinstalled?\nFor several files, you can create a stable directory on, say, your home partition, where you will keep the config files (like hosts or whatever), and link them to your /etc directory or another appropriate place.\nThere are also specialized systems to deal with propagating configuration settings -- see for example puppet.\n", "Q: Why can't I set up alias for shutdown?

(I can clearly remember I have done this before)\nHowever, in newer versions of Ubuntu (say 13.10), \"now\" is no longer a legal value. We should use \"0\" instead.

You may be able to restore the missing files manually, one-by-one, but it is going to be no less than a major headache.\nWhen you asked the same question here you were told (in a comment) to re-install or restore from backup.  It is still a good idea, and opening a new question won't help you get a better answer.\nEdit: I now realise you asked this question before the other question.  But you also asked others.  Stop creating new questions asking about this same problem.\nYou see, often when you hose an application, you can repair it by purging and re-installing the relevant package.  In this case, the application you've hosed is the very one you would need in order to install and remove packages.\n\nA: Create the directory manually with mkdir and do what you already did after that.

Try a different connection (mobile for example) to confirm the case.\nIf possible, contact your ISP to correct this.\nUpdate: The command in your question fails with \n\nConnection refused, Could not open control connection to\n  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, and Call manager exited with error 256\n\nso most likely, telnet will fail with connection refused (by host) as well and this could be different problem. Contact the VPN administrator to check the VPN logs from your IP address and the reason for refusal.\nUpdate 2: You can follow the advice to fix the 256 error from this help page. It is basically these four steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check ping to host\n\n*Check traceroute to host\n\n*Check telnet to host\n\n*Check supported protocols\n\n\nA: Have you called your VPN Server provider yet?

Thank you all in advance for your help.\n\nA: Ok, I got it working. It was a simple issue. I just had to open zynaddsubfx before starting Qjackctl. In the above post, I had to change directories by doing this cd /etc/security. Then, I had to open the file limits.conf. That is where I put in the code:\n@audio -  rtprio     -99\n@audio -  memlock    unlimited\n@audio -  nice       -19\nAfter this, I saved the file. \nThese settings are at the very bottom of the page.

A week ago asking this question of Microsoft or such would have got me labelled as paranoid, and asking this question about Ubuntu would have seemed plain stupid, bordering offensive.\nThen we found out that there's been a \"$250m-a-year US program works covertly with tech companies to insert weaknesses into products\".\nThis is (evil) genius: if you insert secret weaknesses into software or services, e.g. SSL key generation, then your job of breaking in to steal data is made a lot easier. In deed, this is why those agencies can now apparently decrypt a fair bit of SSL traffic on the fly.\nI felt smug, thinking open source saves the day: hard to introduce code that does something daft when everyone's looking (much much easier in closed source world). Although this can still happen, e.g. Debian's massive SSH key fail of 2008.\nBack then, people at slashdot were asking who introduced the change that nobody noticed and which left the OS wide open.\nIt seems that with a $250m budget you've got various options to pay someone to try to sneak in vulnerabilities unnoticed, either out in the open or, as in the Debian case, more internal. This $250m has been used to bribe companies. So what of Canonical? I love Ubuntu and have always trusted it, but knowing they're (a) a company and (b) short of cash, made me think: actually they're in quite a good position to do such evil bidding. I mean sending all your local searches off to amazon seems nothing compared to what they could do, after all, as Shuttleworth says We have root!\nThe German Government recently spotted that they can't trust Windows 8 machines, will they move to Ubuntu? (they're rather partial to Debian anyway.)\nI posed the question in a provocative manor, but I believe it's valid; I'm not seeking opinion, nor rants, but wanted to see if anyone could answer categorically No (and back that up with evidence). \n\nA: Even though this is a valid question, I think it cannot be known whether these practices take place. After all, the purpose of hidden vulnerabilities that are designed into software is for them to remain hidden. \nThere are a few things to take into account, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is harder to hide secret backports in open source software. They almost have to be at the level of algorithms.\n\n*Why would NSA try to get into Ubuntu if they can already read your email and listen in on your phone?\n\n*Why would Ubuntu take such a risk? After all, losing their credibility in the linux world would incite people to use other linux systems.\n\n\nQuite frankly, Ubuntu is dependent on a lot of different software. To be honest, I do not think deliberate contaminations fit the Ubuntu spirit. That being said, who knows...\n", "Q: Assigning Gnome overview mode to custom keyboard shortcut How can I assign Gnome's overview mode to a custom shortcut?\nWhat would be the command that I need to call with my keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: Assuming you are using Gnome 3.8, you can set a custom keyboard shortcut for the activities overview under Shortcut -> System -> Show the activities overview.\n\n\nA: There are two ways you could go about doing this.  \nReplacing Super:\nIf you want to replace the Super key you can use dconf editor.  \nFirst install dconf with:  \nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools  \n\nThen open dconf and navigate to:  \norg -> gnome -> mutter\n\nand change the value of overlay-key from Super_L to whichever key you want to use. (Unfortunately I'm not sure what the strings for all the keys are...).  \nDual overview keys\nIf you would like to make another key, in addition to the Super, activate the overview you will need xbindkeys and xdotool:  \nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xdotool  \n\nNow create the xbindkeys configuration file:  \ntouch .xbindkeysrc  \n\nAnd edit that file:  \ngedit .xbindkeysrc  \n\nAnd add:  \nxdotool key 'Super_L'\ncustomKey  \n\nReplace customKey with the key you want to use to open the overview.  \nYou can find key names with  \nxbindkeys -k  \n\n(Credit for the dconf solution goes to user SoumyaC on Ask Fedora)\n", "Q: Which partition is windows? I tried to install Ubuntu 13.04 beside Windows 7. At the point where it gave me the option to increase or decrease partition space, I couldn't figure out which side was the Windows partition and which was the Ubuntu partition. Can you help? Left or right is Windows?  \nI have 350 GB of disk space and only want to allocate 40 GB to Ubuntu.  However, I don't want to make a mistake and allocate the 40Gb to Windows instead.\n\nA: gparted, Ubuntu and Linux in general recognize Windows partitions and will show the formatting of the disc correctly as NTFS (or on older Windows as FAT). Linux systems use most times ext with a 2, 3 or 4 behind it. So all you need to do is check the formatting of the disc to identify what kind of OS is on what partition. \nExample:\n\nHere sda1, sda5, sda6, sda7 are Windows related partitions.\nWindows on the other hand does not recognize Linux file systems so do your resizing in Ubuntu and you should be fine checking what partition is what. \nBesides that: Windows still insists to be on the 1st partition of a disc so I assume it will be on the left side. \n\nA: From Install Ubuntu 13.04:\n\nAllocate drive space\nUse the checkboxes to choose whether you’d like to Install Ubuntu\nalongside another operating system, delete your existing operating\nsystem and replace it with Ubuntu, or — if you’re an advanced user —\nchoose the ’Something else’ option:\n\nBegin the installation\nDepending on your previous selections, you can now verify that you\nhave chosen the way in which you would like to install Ubuntu.

Only 900 MB is achieved after shrinking using disk management tool in windows. \nI tried to install both  13.04 and 12.04.3 versions. But none of them showed the traditional option of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows. The reason I can't mess with company's laptop and I am dying without Ubuntu.\nI hope that somebody can help me resolve this problem. \n\nA: 900M is too small for an Ubuntu desktop install.  You would be better off with a persistent USB or a full install to USB (still can be done on a 4G stick without swap).  USB3 sticks would be ideal, but USB2 sticks work OK, with some performance reduction.\n\nIf you have msdos partitioning, you are limited to only 4 primary partitions, and if you already have 4, you cannot create anymore, so maybe the side by side option is not offered.  You would need to backup a partition, delete it, then remake it and all free space as an extended partition, into which you may add logical parititions as needed.  Ubuntu does not care if it is on a logical partition.  But if you really don't have the room anyway, why bother.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu work with reproducible builds? In a comment on the question Does Ubuntu deliberately contaminate its binaries to help NSA?, Jorge Castro notes that debian is thinking about working with reproducible builds. They state\n\nWhy do we want reproducible builds?\n\n*\n\n*Independent verifications that a binary matches what the source intended to produce.\n\n*Help Multi-Arch: same packages co-installation (as they need every matching file to be byte identical).\n\n*Be able to generate debug symbols for packages which do not have a “debug package”.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any indication that Ubuntu plans on implementing reproducible builds as well?\n\n\nA: (This is a copy of my answer on ubuntu-devel.)\nWith very few exceptions, nearly all of Debian's work on this will just be going into the packages that form part of the package build toolchain, and as such Ubuntu will inherit it over the natural course of merging and syncing packages from Debian.  The possible exceptions are things like the proposed libfaketime etc. preloads that we might insert into builds; I'd certainly be keen to keep up to date with things Debian does in this area, not just to protect against intrusion but also because there are immediate practical benefits to doing so (safer multiarch handling).\nI'm not aware that this has been specifically discussed within Canonical, mostly because most of the relevant people are pretty heads-down working on the Ubuntu Touch product at the moment; but I also think there's work to be done in Debian first before we pick anything up.\n\nA: This question is somewhat badly defined. Every distro ever will work with a reproducible build. Any build that includes no information about the environment it was built from is reproducible. It's the external state of the build environment that causes problems.\nWant a \"reproducible build\"?\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main ( int argc, char * argv[] ) {\n  printf (\"%s\\n\", \"hello world\");\n  return 0;\n}\n\nWant a non-reproducable build?\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main ( int argc, char * argv[] ) {\n  printf (\"%s\\n\", __DATE__); // this will change every day.\n  return 0;\n}\n\nIt's not about will Ubuntu \"work with\". It has always worked with. It's about what will be done to \"ensure that\", and \"reject violations\".\nWith that said, currently the plan is to address the problems in GCC and the individual packages. I'm not aware of any plans to reject things that are not reproducible.

I added the 80 GB hard disk just a few days ago, before which I was using only the hard disk with Ubuntu. \nBefore the addition of the second hard disk, the Time & Date settings worked fine in Ubuntu(It showed the correct time and date every time I booted my PC). But now, whenever I boot my system, the time is wrong. Even if I set it correctly it becomes wrong the next time I boot my PC.\nWhat is causing this problem and how can I resolve it?\n\nA: This is caused by the way the two operating systems set the hardware clock.

I want to be able to\n\n\n*\n\n*use textboxes for translating words into pixels;\n\n*import existing images;\n\n*scale and move everything to fit together.\n\nA: Probably the easiest tool to use is Inkscape. There is a learning curve to all software, though. Install it by typing the following command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install inkscape\n\nInkscape is free. It is an open source equivalent for Adobe Illustrator. It allows you to draw vectors (stars, squares, cricles,..), to select their colors, to cut and paste them,  to add text, and more.\nOnce you have designed your logo you can export it as a .png (pronounced ping) file. That file you can use in your website. If it is too large you can downscale it or you can make it a .jpeg file by opening it with gimp and saving it as a .jpeg file.\n\nA: I use Inkscape and GIMP for my professional graphics work. I usually make logos in Inkscape and then use GIMP for minor editing and finishing. \nOther good vector graphics software is Xara Xtreme. It's pretty fast and quite efficient but its development seems to be stalled as the last released version is pretty dated now.\n", "Q: How to delete sub-folders but keep all the files? I'm wondering if there's a way on Ubuntu to delete all of the subfolders in a folder but keep all the files?\n\nA: a combination of the two answers above might work.\nstep 1.  \nfind oldLocation -type f -exec mv {} newLocation \\;   #find and copy all files.\n\nstep 2.  \nrm -frv oldLocation \n\nYou might want to reword your questions, it's not very clear what the behavior you want is. \n\nA: I'm going to assume you have a folder like this:\ndir\n subdir1  <--directory\n subdir2  <--directory\n file.txt <--file\n foo.mp3  <--file\n bar.pdf  <--file\n\n...and you simply want to delete the two subdirectories and all they contain, leaving the files untouched. Simply use:\nrm -r */\n\nThe trailing slash ensures that it will only match directories (and links to directories).\nYour question is pretty vague though, please edit it to make it clear what you actually want.\n\nA: Assuming you have a directory where you want to delete all subdirectories and any files and directories they contain but keep the files that were in the original directory, you can do\nfind your_directory -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nSo given a tree like\n/path/to/dir1\n|_ _ _ _ subdir1\n|           |_ _ _ _ file1\n|           |_ _ _ _ file2\n|\n|_ _ _ _ subdir2\n|\n|_ _ _ _ file3\n|\n|_ _ _ _ file4\n\nrunning\nfind /path/to/dir1 -maxdepth1 -type d -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nwill leave you with\n/path/to/dir1    \n|\n|_ _ _ _ file3\n|\n|_ _ _ _ file4\n\n\nA: I know it's possible to delete all files but keep the directories by this command:\nfind . -name *.* -exec rm -f {} \\;\n\nBut I don't believe there to be a opposite way. \n\nA: Um, I assume that you want to keep the files in some new folder, right?\nCaution: make sure you are in the correct directory. Make sure you do a test run first. Make sure there are no files with identical names in different directories.\nmv */* /path/to/new/folder\nrmdir *\n\nThings get a tad more complicated if you have more than one level, e.g. you have sub-sub-sub-folders and you want to move the regular files and remove the directories. In that case,\nfind . -type f -exec mv {} /path/to/new/folder \\;\nfind . -type d -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nLet's make the challenge even more interesting. Say, we want move the files, but we want to change the names such that they reflect the directory structure. For example, if, in the current directory there is a file foo.jpg in ./blah/pah/oh/, then we want to rename it to blah_pah_oh_foo.jpg. For safety reasons, we can copy it instead of moving.\nfor i in `find . -type f -print` ; do \\\n  newname=`echo $i | sed 's/^\\.\\///;s/\\//_/g'` ; \\\n  echo moving $i to $newname ; \\\n  mv $i $newname ; \\\ndone\n\n\nA: The question is impossible.

I want to know if I can do this and have a decent 64 bit OS.\n\nA: Yes, it should run fine with 3 gig of RAM. The real question is what do your APPS require.\nBut web browsing etc should run just fine.\n\nA: If your processor supports 64-bit operations, then you should install the 64-bit Ubuntu. The amount of RAM is acceptable, so it will not be a problem.\nSee What are the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit, and which should I choose? for more information.\n\nA: 64-bits only refers to the architecture of the processor. The memory limitations that it prevents is a plus. Is being said that if your processor supports 64-bits, then the recommended installation should be 64-bits.\nBut remember, that 64-bits builds tend to be more resources intensive than 32-bits counter parts. Also, some software is not available in 64-bits, and that could cause set backs.\nBottom line, if your system supports 64-bits and you think that there is no problem using 64-bits, go for it. The benefits of using 64-bits are practically null and is well known that 32bit OS's can be installed in 64-bits processors without problem.\n", "Q: How can I recover data?

Yesterday I plugged in a USB and on switching on the comp it started to boot from the USB drive. When I saw that I immediately pulled the USB out (my bad!) and the comp was stuck. But when I re started it, it booted normally but gets stuck on the login screen. The OS does not recognize either the keyboard nor the mouse. I tried using Boot Repair but that did not help. The link that Boot Repair provided me is http://paste.ubuntu.com/6092970/ My system is also running Win8 and it doesn't have any problem.

For example, allowing processes to run as root without security context can be a security risk.\nThe help page about SELinux suggests that SELinux is a program that needs to be manually installed.\nSo then how does Ubuntu handle security context out of the box?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses AppArmor, a SELinux alternative.\nWikipedia gives some hints on why some people think AppArmor is better than SELinux:\n\nAppArmor is offered in part as an alternative to SELinux, which critics consider difficult for administrators to set up and maintain. Unlike SELinux, which is based on applying labels to files, AppArmor works with file paths. Proponents of AppArmor claim that it is less complex and easier for the average user to learn than SELinux. They also claim that AppArmor requires fewer modifications to work with existing systems: for example, SELinux requires a filesystem that supports \"security labels\", and thus cannot provide access control for files mounted via NFS. AppArmor is filesystem-agnostic.\n\nUbuntu ships many AppArmor profiles for core applications. You can find them in /etc/apparmor.d/. If you need to edit the default profiles, you can override settings from /etc/apparmor.d/local/.\nUbuntu also ships some so-called \"abstractions\", which are ways to help you write your own AppArmor profiles quickly without repeating yourself (the famous DRY principle).\nOne thing that is important to note is that the AppArmor profile for Firefox is disabled by default, because it might be too restrictive for many users. You can however enable it as described on the documentation:\nsudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox\n\nIf you want to go with SELinux, you are free to disable AppArmor and install the selinux package. Note however that the default configuration for SELinux in Ubuntu is not much restrictive, so you have to configure it yourself.\n\nA: As Andrea's answer points out, Ubuntu use AppArmor. The \"default\" SELinux context Ubuntu uses, depends greatly on how do you install SELinux (I believe that the selinux-default, is the one that you are looking). Of course, if you install none, you should configure it according to your tastes.\n", "Q: Not able to access folder due to wrong CHMOD commands I was not able to view my custom vhost www.ajweb.dev in my apache2.\nMy www folder resided in /home/ajinkya/www\nSo I did following.\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:~$ cd www\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:~/www$ chmod 755 ./www\nchmod: cannot access `./www': No such file or directory\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:~/www$ chmod 755 ../www\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:~/www$ sudo chmod 755 ../www\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:~/www$ sudo useradd -g www-data ajinkya\nuseradd: user 'ajinkya' already exists\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:~/www$ sudo chown -R www-data /home/ajinkya/www\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:~/www$ sudo service apache2 restart\n * Restarting web server apache2                                                                                                                      Warning: DocumentRoot [/home/ajinkya/www/aj/ajweb] does not exist\napache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName\n ... waiting Warning: DocumentRoot [/home/ajinkya/www/aj/ajweb] does not exist\napache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName\n                                                                                                                                               [ OK ]\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:~/www$ cd /etc/apache2/\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:/etc/apache2$ cd sites-enabled/\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled$ ls\n000-default  000-default~  ajweb.dev  ajweb.dev~\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled$ sudo gedit ajweb.dev\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled$ sudo service apache2 restart\n * Restarting web server apache2                                                                                                                      apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName\n ... waiting apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName\n                                                                                                                                               [ OK ]\najinkya@ajinkya-Inspiron-3521:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled$ \n\nAnd now Im not able to view/open that folder manually.\n\nls -l /home/ajinkya | grep www\ndrwxrwxr-x 5 www-data ajinkya    4096 Sep 11 15:33 www\n\n\nA: It looks like your attempt to join the www-data group failed.\nTry this command sudo adduser ajinkya www-data\nTo verify you are in the www-data group, run groups and it should show up in the list.

Someone told me to use the command \"apt-get update \"to update my software and hardware updates frequently. What exactly is updated and how often should I update it.\n\nA: apt-get is an incredibly useful tool. Try reading this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto site to get an idea of what apt-get can be used for!\nAs for your specific question, @Braiam and @Alaa have very well done answers, read theirs first. Your friend is rather mis-informed. This is from the man-page for apt-get:\nupdate: update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources.\nThe indexes of available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in /etc/apt\n/sources.list. For example, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and \nscans the Packages.gz files, so that information about new and updated packages is \navailable. An update should always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade. \nPlease be aware that the overall progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the \npackage files cannot be known in advance.\n\nI like what @Braiam broke this down into:\nQUOTE: @Braiam:\n\nLong story short: this download the list of packages and their versions from repositories so you can use them later to install, remove or upgrade packages. This don't update/upgrade packages on their own.  It just refresh the list of the packages. For upgrading packages you use apt-get upgrade:\n\nupgrade: upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages \ncurrently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. \nPackages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; \nunder no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already \ninstalled retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that \ncannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left \nat their current version. An update must be performed first so that apt-get knows that \nnew versions of packages are available.\nObviously apt-get update doesn't download/install the latest and greatest program update(s), it only makes sure that any newly added PPAs are included in the sources.list file. This allows you to install programs from non-default sources and is also why you have to run apt-get update after add-apt-repository. \nIn your case you would want to run apt-get update after adding a PPA. Ubuntu automatically checks for updates either every week or as you configure it. It, when updates are available, shows a nice little GUI that lets you choose the updates to install, and then downloads/installs the selected ones. \nUnless you want to force Ubuntu to check for updates, you don't need to run any special commands, just use your computer normally and you will eventually be alerted to the updates and be allowed to install them.\n\nA: Please, don't trust this \"someone\". He seems to be mal informed or misinforming on propose.\nLets explain what each commands of apt-get do and what apt-get is, from man pages:\n\napt-get is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be\n         considered the user's \"back-end\" to other tools using the APT library.\n\nNow, this is confusing if you don't have previous knowledge. APT stands for Advanced Package Tool, and apt-get is the APT package handling utility -- command-line interface.\nThat said, apt-get is the transmission that controls the dpkg engine that move the entire Debian-based systems. A .deb system without apt-get is severally limited in their functionality to install, remove and upgrade packages.\nNow apt-get accepts differents commands or orders, this is what each of them do, from man again:\n\nupdate: \n             update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their\n             sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the\n             location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when\n             using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the\n             Packages.gz files, so that information about new and updated\n             packages is available. An update should always be performed before\n             an upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be aware that the overall\n             progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the package files\n             cannot be known in advance.\n\nLong story short: this download the list of packages and their versions from repositories so you can use them later to install, remove or upgrade packages. This don't update/upgrade packages on their own. It just refresh the list of the packages. For upgrading packages you use upgrade:\n\nupgrade:\n             upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages\n             currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in\n             /etc/apt/sources.list.

New versions of\n             currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without\n             changing the install status of another package will be left at\n             their current version. An update must be performed first so that\n             apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n\nOnce this confusion is cleared, I think I answered the \"What exactly is updated\" part of the question. For \"how often should I update it\" is more like a opinion based behavior, but is common believe and the update-manager (a GUI) is configured like that too, is updating the indexes and upgrading the packages once a day.\nPlease, tell that someone that is in his wrong and direct them here or to some documentation before misguide users giving flawed advise.\n\nA: I'll try to put this in layman's terms.\nIn Ubuntu, \"software\" is stored in repositories. Repositories are basically machines that contain an archive of all the software that you can install in Ubuntu.\napt-get update is a command that tells Ubuntu to \"go and update your software index\". So Ubuntu goes and asks each one of the repositories \"what software do you have? And what version is it?\" Your Ubuntu keeps a list of all of the available software and their versions.\nThen, apt (which is the brains behind all of this) compares the version of the software that you have with the version of the software in the repositories. For example, let's say you have Skype version 3 installed, but when Ubuntu went and asked the repositories (apt-get update), it found out that they have version 4 available, so now, apt knows that Skype needs to be upgraded.\napt-get upgrade is the command that actually tells Ubuntu \"okay, go and get Skype version 4, and install it\". Obviously, this command doesn't only upgrade Skype, it upgrades everything else that needs to be upgraded. So apt-get upgrade is the command that upgrades your software. \n\nSo now, to answer your questions:\n\nWhat exactly is updated?\n\napt-get update updates its index of packages that are available in the repositories. So technically, this command doesn't really \"update\" (or \"upgrade\") any software. The command to do that is apt-get upgrade. \n\nHow often should I update it?\n\nI don't think there's a definitive answer here, but Ubuntu takes care of that for you. By default, Ubuntu is pre-configured to run the command apt-get update every now and then. That is why, if you leave Ubuntu for a while without updating or upgrading it, you'll see a box like this:\n\nIt ran apt-get update in the background, and it identified that there is software that needs to be upgraded. All you need to do is hit Install Now, and Ubuntu should start downloading and installing. Clicking Install Now is just the equivalent of doing apt-get upgrade.\n", "Q: Inproper connection using RTL8192CU 802.11n WLAN Adapter Am using Ubuntu 12.10 on a philips MT2400 unit and have a BT Homehub2.

I can enter setup during POST, but I don't see these options anywhere. Anyone know where to find them?\n\nA: The option that's critical to disable is not the \"fast boot\" feature in the firmware; it's the \"fast startup\" feature in Windows. This feature turns shutdown operations into suspend-to-disk operations, which means that the filesystems are left in an inconsistent state, which is a recipe for disaster when you dual-boot.

I have a new Asus N550JV-D71 (not sure about the part after the dash, though I definitely know it includes 71). I decided to downgrade Windows 8 to 7, then dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 with it (there were issues with Windows 8, and I had a Windows 7 disk handy). It did work and, after installing Bumblebee in tty (because it wouldn't boot when it was first installed), it worked marvelously for a little less than a week. However, I restarted it last night and got the Could not write bytes: Broken pipes error. (I see it's a very common error, but I've looked at the majority of the suggested Similar Questions already.) I followed what I could find online, followed those instructions (making sure to not install any sort of graphics drivers other than what Bumblebee provides), and it just seems to go further and further downhill.\nI'm afraid I didn't write the exact steps to get to this point (it was late by the time I gave up the night before), but it involved reinstalling lightdm, xorg (and xserver?), and Bumblebee. I then changed the Bumblebee.conf file so that Device=nvidia. I'm pretty new to Linux in general (I've used it since 10.04, but I hadn't had issues up until this computer, so it let me stay a newbie), so I'm not exactly sure what log files to look at to find the errors to look up. However, I did look at lshw and noticed that displays was marked as unassigned. Also, if I try to start lightdm using the command line, it always stops at Stopping Mount network filesystems. I should note that there isn't an xorg.conf file, and no .Xauthority. \nI would really, really prefer not to reinstall 12.04 if possible. I managed to get grub to display only a short time ago, and I can't boot to the dvd drive unless I go into the BIOS settings and manually change the boot order (that was an issue from the beginning, before the Ubuntu install), and getting into those settings often means rebooting several times due to the fact that the window to get to it is extremely small. I have most of what I need backed up, however, in case it does get to that point. If I really have to, I can just use the latest Ubuntu version instead of the LTS, but the reason I chose 12.04 in the first place is because I need something stable-ish, and Windows isn't suitable to what I need to do.\nI should note that the reason I restarted last night in the first place was that it wasn't charging the battery, and the wifi kept on going out.\nHardware:\nNvidia GeForce GT 750M\nIntel HD graphics 4600\n\nA: I answered this before but apparently it was to wordy and got \"deleted\" for not answering so here is my next try at this without the explainations for why.\nI have the exact same Haswell and 750M nvidia so I know exactly what you mean. For me, I was able to get the system working again by uninstalling the nvidia-prime dependency.\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-prime\n\nThat got most of the things working again just restarting lightdm after uninstalling that. Not explaining why this time since that is apparently off topic. What did not still work after that was the \"optimus\" system but I expect it to get worked out soonish by others.\nIf you cannot wait and want the optimus system working ASAP, then uninstall everything \"raring\" related and install \"quantas\" related equivalents instead. Then install the bumblebee/primus systems like normal and you are good. Remember both the xserver and the kernel must be of the quantas variety not raring in order to get optimus working again right now. If you still have a raring kernel installed, it will default to that kernel on bootup so manually switch to the quantas kernel or remove the raring kernel completely.\n", "Q: Flash plugin / youtube issue Using Firefox and Chrome.\nyoutube wrking with HTML5 when flash plugin inactive.\nbut\nyoutube just stays still with black window, after loading the video, when using flash plugin to play it.\n(why flash plugin needed isntead, if HTML wkring?

First, a bit of background. I managed to dual boot Ubuntu 13.04 with Windows 8(preinstalled). I disabled secure boot. I had to go in the bios settings and change the disk order to select Ubuntu as the first disk(it created Ubuntu as a boot device). Grub would open and I only saw Ubuntu. I opened Ubuntu and ran boot repair and then when I rebooted I could see Ubuntu and windows 8. Both OS' worked perfectly.\nAfter messing up Ubuntu, I decided that a reinstall was in order. However I decided to install elementary OS over Ubuntu. Since I only had 1 partition for Ubuntu (not counting swap) I simply deleted the partition, recreated a ext4 partition, and left the boot loader in its default place (dev/sa I believe ). Rebooted, again only option was elementary OS, so I ran boot repair once again, and sure enough I got my windows 8 back. Tried both and they both worked. I then was having a bit of trouble with elementary OS, so I decided to reinstall Ubuntu again. I repeated the same steps as before, deleted the 1 partition which contained elementary OS, and installed Ubuntu on a newly created partition.\nThis is where my problem begins. Upon rebooting after finishing the install, I would only get a blank screen. So I decided to look at my bios settings again and I noticed that elementary was still in the boot devices, instead of Ubuntu. I thought maybe booting in the live usb and running boot repair again would fix it. Ran the recommended action, rebooted and still got the blank screen. Looked at the boot devices in bios and elementary is still there.\nI've tried a couple of different settings in boot repair, however I always get the blank screen. For some reason I cannot seem to remove elementary from the boot device list.

I'm currently working on a web project on uWSGI, it's quite a chore to keep typing the same command in the terminal everytime I want to start up uWSGI, so I made an executable script that will automatically run the process when I execute it.\nIt works, but the problem is, normally when I run uWSGI from the terminal manually (by typing in the commands), when I try to close the terminal window while the process is still running, it will prompt me if I want to terminate the process before closing the terminal.\nHowever, the terminal window that appears after I ran the executable script from GUI will not warn me when I accidentally close the window, and as a result the process will still be running in the background.\nHow can I make the script such that it will display a warning like it normally will when I try to close the terminal window when the process is still running?\n\nA: Just add the following line at the end of your script:\n$SHELL\n\n", "Q: Running 13.04 on Dell XPS 12?

It's not asking you what username and password you want to use in the system you're installing. It's asking for the username and password for the live environment.\nAs AliNa says, the username is ubuntu and the password is blank (assuming you have not changed it in the live CD/DVD/USB since you booted from it, which you probably have not).\nIf for some reason you want to shut down on the login screen (for example, if that username and password doesn't work), holding down the power button is not the best way to do it. A very clean way to restart is to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 followed by Ctrl+Alt+Delete.\nBut you should be able to log back in to the live CD/DVD/USB system with the username ubuntu and the blank password.\nIf you're running from a live CD/DVD/USB and you want to install Ubuntu, and the installation is not started, you probably selected Try Ubuntu without installing rather than Install Ubuntu. If that's the case, then when you're ready to install, you can click the Install Ubuntu icon on the Unity launcher, which is the bar of icons on the left side of the desktop.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to wi-fi with AR5BWB222 on Ubuntu 13.04 I have just installed Ubuntu 13.04, and am using an Atheros wireless card (AR5BWB222). I find that I can see networks, but cannot connect to any of them. Attempting to do so leads to about 30 seconds of attempting to connect, following by a message telling me that I have been disconnected. I have no backup network connection and cannot therefore run any sudo apt-get commands, although I can transfer files very slowly by loading Windows 8 and saving files to another partition (I cannot use a USB stick as only my two USB 3.0 ports appear to be recognized by Ubuntu, both of which I need for mouse/keyboard). lsmod tells me that ath9k is in use, but fixes related to using usehwcrypt=0 have had no effect. rfkill shows no hard or soft block. I will happily post any and all relevant diagnostic information, of course.\nI apologize if I am repeating an already known bug, but my searches elsewhere have not given me any working solutions. This is particularly problematic as I need to install the wireless to be able to run boot-repair before I can even boot into the right partition to begin fixing my problems with the USB...\n\nA: What I have personally done to create my networks is the following (though I have done this with fixed ethernet rather than wireless connections - I am guessing it works the same):\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, remember that ifconfig = fixed connections, and iwconfig = wireless connections, so you won't see wireless connection information with the ifconfig command\n\n*Next, if you have the GUI / desktop installed, use the UI menu item (top right corner drop down menu) to create a new network connection ... select the correct MAC address, and then choose your DHCP or static settings etc.\n\n*sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\n*edit the last line after [ifupdown] to managed = true\n\n*this is only one approach, but it is basically choosing to use one set of management tools over another (I believe)\n\n*Next: sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\n*and if there is a connection there for your wlan0 (or whatever the connection is called - for mine it is of course eth0), which says something like: #iface wlan0 inet dhcp, and you wanted to set a static address ... then you comment out that line\n\n*Finally, if you are getting the error message about the avahi-daemon not liking your .local domain, you just edit as follows:\n\n*sudo nano /etc/default/avahi-daemon\n\n*change or add > AVAHI_DAEMON_DETECT_LOCAL=0\n\n\nNow reboot ... you should be able to connect to your fixed or wireless connections ... apologies if this is only for fixed, I don't remember reading that part (though I think I did manage to get it to work for a wireless connection, that was a while ago, let me know how you go)\nOne other alternative I saw involved downloading tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install wireless-tools\n\n\n... but I didn't go down that path, so you would have to google that one yourself.\nGood luck !\n\nA: This problem is partially solved. I have found that, if I enable IOMMU in my BIOS, the wireless and USB 2.0 ports start working - but the USB 3.0 ports stop working. A little frustrating, to say the least.\n", "Q: How to transfer a DVD to my hard drive I have several DVD I want to transfer to my Hard drive. I want to have the DVD menu and such. Not only the movie. I was sure that ripping the movie will do the trick but it didn't work. What can I do then?\nI tried dvd::rip and acidrip. Both aren't that clear to operate. \n\nA: You can use GNU-ddrescue (https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html) for ripping. It is better than dd, because it retries failed reads and skips unreadable parts (if disk is scratched).\nOpen a Terminal (with for example Ctrl+Alt+T) and install GNU ddrescue:\n  sudo apt-get install gddrescue\n\nthan ripp disk:\n  ddrescue -b 2048 -d -r 2 -v /dev/sr0 <Destination>.iso <Destination>.log\n\nStop ripping with Ctrl + C, because reading of scratched DVDs may take long. You can resume ripping with calling  same command again.\nIf DVD is encrypted you have to install libdvdcss (How can I play encrypted DVD movies?) and open DVD with a movie player like vlc before ripping (GNU ddrescue will not decrypt DVD).\n\nA: if your dvd contains movie, you can use VLC media player\n\nopen VLC media player >> Media >> Convert / Save or Ctrl+R\n\nthen select Disk tab, browse disk device and if you dont know where is the DVD is then you can just right click on the DVD on your left pane Files and choose Properties you will see the DVD location like /media/username/DVDname.\nthen press convert/save button, wait and dont close your VLC until the streaming process is done.\nmore: https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/2696/how-to-rip-dvds-with-vlc/\n\nA: You can use the dd command.  You can save the disc as ISO, and then you can mount and play.  just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sr0 of=~/<file_name>.iso\n\n\nA: Currently doing this...\nIf your DVDs are encrypted and the dd command isn't working, you first need to install libdvdread4.

I've found installing and re-stalling Ubuntu this way very helpful since 2012. This method simplifies the process and helps avoiding unforeseen problems. You can take up the wireless matter afterwards. \nBy the way, all laptops' internal wireless adapters are compatible with Windows, Linux and OSX. \nPlease let me know whether my suggestion helps.

In order to do this you have to install mercurial first:\nsudo apt-get install mercurial\n\nthen download SDL (SDL will be downloaded into the directory you're using the terminal)\nhg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL\n\nnow go into the downloaded SDL directory and build & install (don't forget to install the dependencies mentioned above, before starting to compile) the libs by running:\ncd SDL\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nDon't forget to run:\nsudo ldconfig\n\nto update the necessary links and cache to the libraries.\nCode::Blocks\nAdd to\nProject > Build options > Compiler settings > Other options > -lSDL2\nand to\nProject > Build options > Linker settings > Other linker options -lSDL2\nRemember to add these to the Project options and not only to Debug or Release settings.

I have shared folders on all which I would like to be able to access on the other computers. For some strange reason the 3rd computer can only see its own shared files. It fails to see the other computers (under Nautilus). The computer is connected to the LAN because it has no trouble printing on a shared network printer.\nThe other 2 computers see one another and can access all of the shared folders (excluding those on the 3rd computer).\nI tried to put in the location window of Nautilus the location of the folder, so as not to depend upon the browse. For example on the 3rd computer I put\nsmb://ilan-main/mydb\nIt gave me the error message: Oops! Something went wrong. Unhandled error message: Failed to mount Windows share: Connection timed out.\nI also tried to connect to the 3rd computer from this one with\nsmb://ilan-lenovo-g570/temp\nand I received the same error.

I have a network printer installed. In the printer properties dialog, I clearly have the printer option \"Double sided printing\" set to \"On (Flip on Long Edge)\", and the job option \"Pages per side\" set to \"1\":\n\n\nHowever, when I open the print dialog of evince, I see 2 pages per slide and one-sided printing:\n\nI was not able to change this to system defaults for the printer.

I used strace to trace the system calls from evince, and found that evince tried to open the following files:\nopen(\"/etc/cups/lpoptions\", O_RDONLY)   = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopen(\"/home/january/.lpoptions\", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopen(\"/home/january/.cups/lpoptions\", O_RDONLY) = 48\n\nThe third one was present and contained the offending options:\n\nDefault XXX collate=false Duplex=None InputSlot=Default number-up=2\n  outputorder=normal PageSize=A4 position=center PrintoutMode=Normal\n  Quality=FromPrintoutMode scaling=100 wrap=false\n\nStrangely, the file was there for the last two years, but apparently has not been used with evince running in 10.04, which I have recently replaced by 13.04. Removing it resulted in the correct settings taken over from the properties of the printer.\n", "Q: No root privileges when using GUI So I'm logged in as the user 'Shannon', but can't gain root access through the GUI when I'm prompted to install a program for example. However using sudo su, type in the root password, gain access through the terminal and then install the programs from there. Aren't these passwords supposed to be identical?\nDoes anyone know how to fix this one?\n\nA: OK, let me write a short clarification. There are two different users: Shannon and root. In Ubuntu, by default, root does not have a password at all and cannot log in at all. If Shannon wants to do a task requiring root privileges, he uses the command sudo that consults a file called  /etc/sudoers and has the ability to turn Shannon into root. \nBy default, sudo wants to make sure that Shannon actually is Shannon and not his dog who just took over the keyboard. This is why sudo asks user Shannon for his (and not root's) password. Also note that \"a task requiring root privileges\" can be a bash shell, which essentially means that you can log in as root (without using root password!). \nSo, it is not that the two users (Shannon and root) have different passwords, but that the password of root is not actually being asked for at all.\nPersonally, I don't have a dog; that is why I modified /etc/sudoers in such a way that it never asks me for my password -- being there is sufficient. Using the command sudo visudo I have edited /etc/sudoers and edited the following line:\n%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nThe line above means that all users from the sudo group (and I can only assume that Shannon belongs to this group if he installed his system) can run essentially ALL root commands.\n%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nAh, but now the NOPASSWD directive makes sure that not only I can run any program as root, I can run it without being pestered for typing a password. Note that to edit this file I must use the program visudo which makes sure that I don't make any syntax error. Syntax error in the sudoers file might completely disable the sudo system -- and then, if root does not have a password, you are in a deep kacka.\nTo add confusion, there is yet another program allowing for gaining root privileges temporarily called su. However, su is much more primitive -- it just asks for the password of the root. Therefore, it does not work in a default Ubuntu installation.\nSo, which password is actually asked for when you type sudo su? Well, the command that you are running first is sudo , not su. Thus, you are asked for Shannon's password, not roots. sudo then gains root privileges and runs su as root. But when the root runs su, su does not ask for a password. In any case, don't do that -- that is what sudo -i is for (does exactly the same thing).\n\nA: By default root is locked in ubuntu. \nTo get root privileges we use sudo su where it asks for our password. \nWhile installing any software it also prompts for the same password. \nTo unlock the root account use sudo -i and passwd in this way you can unlocak root account which is not advised though.  \n", "Q: Unable to get email cache on mail clients on raring ringtail I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail.\nWhen I try to send an email my email cache does not show email addresses of the people I have sent emails to before which is annoying cause I have to type the whole email address every time for each person I need to send the email to.\nTried Thunderbird and Evolution.\nIs there any way I can get this fixed?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks \n\nA: Have you tried enabling \"Automatically add outgoing e-mail addresses to my:\" form Composition settings in Thunderbird?\nOpen up Thunderbird, click on the app menu (the three dashes) and then \"Settings\" now in \"Composition\" tab enable \"Automatically add outgoing e-mail addresses to my:\".\nWith this feature every time you send an email Thunderbird adds the email address inside the address book. \n", "Q: Where to send feature request? My problem is that resizing windows is a pain. (related question: One pixel 'grab' area when resizing windows , but resizing at the edges is still too clumsy, I do know about the drag-to-edge-resizing but that is not appropriate for all scenarios)\nI used to set up tiling window managers or do other tweaking, but that is a lot of grief (takes time; not everything will work appropritely, e.g. indicators; you never know what will break with an upgrade; non-official; etc.)\nInstead I would like to make a simple request of making the area at which to click for resizing to be much-much-bigger.\nMy suggestion is that since there are no button on the right side of the window-header, it could be much larger there. For example a sqaure with side-length equal to that of the thickness of the window-header.\nWhere can I post this rewust so it has the most potential of being realized?\n\nA: I find the easiest way of resizing and moving is to press the left Alt key and then click anywhere in the window with the first button (move) or the second button (resize). I even completely remove the window decorations to have less clutter on my screen.\nIf it does not work for you, install ccsm (compiz config settings manager) and enable the plugins \"resize window\" and \"move window\". Also, resizing does not work in some laptops where wheel emulation is switched on, for example on Thinkpads wwith a Trackpoint you need to turn it off with the command\nxinput set-prop \"TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation\" 0\n\n\nA: This is not an answer to your question but just a tip: if you are using Unity, there is one plugin that comes disabled by default called \"Unity Grab Handles\" that is really handy in this situation.\nYou can see here how it works and how you can activate it.\n", "Q: Cannot change Synaptic trackpad ClickPad areas in synclient/xinput I have run into trouble trying to configure the ClickPad areas of the\nCypress trackpad in the Dell XPS 13. By default, if I press the left\nbutton, I get a left click, if I press the right button, I get a right\nclick. I would like to change these areas (perhaps disable the right\nbutton and/or add a middle button).\nSetting in synclient the RightButtonAreaLeft/etc. does not seem to\nproduce a change in the area that registers a right button click.\nSimilarly, setting it in 50-synaptics.conf or setting it in xinput\n\"Synaptic Soft Button Areas\" does not seem to produce a change.\nWould it be possible that changing these options doesn't do anything\nbecause the Cypress driver does not support these changes? See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/978807/comments/108\nI am running a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.04 (also tried on Xubuntu\n13.04). Kernel 3.8.0-19 (everything else works, including backlight\nand Wifi). My understanding is that I don't need to add the Sputnik\nPPA because everything has been pushed into 13.04...\nI confirm that synclient and xinput are accepting other options, e.g.\nTouchpadOff, TapButton, ClickFinger.\nSetting ClickPad to 0 does not turn the ClickPad left/right button\nfunctionality off, too! Still, I can left and right button click in\nthe same trackpad areas.\nPerhaps this is relevant:\nI have noticed is that xinput test seems to show x,y coordinates that\ncorrespond not to the position of a touch but to the position of the\nmouse cursor on the screen (left upper corner being 0,0 and bottom\nright corner being 1600,900). But synclient -m 1 (needs SHMConfig\nenabled, set in 50-synaptics.conf) produces coordinates that\ncorrespond to the touch position (bottom right corner being 1100,620).\nThis seems odd because the default RightButtonAreaLeft in synclient\n(equivalently, the first value of Synaptics Soft Button Areas in\nxinput) is set to 800 (exactly half of 1600, the x coordinate shown by\nxinput when the cursor is at the right edge of the screen). Shouldn't\nthis be half of the right edge touch position, 550? Similarly with the\ny coordinate.\nAny insight would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Call me pedantic but your question isn't precise in one point: Did you try to apply RightButtonAreaLeft as well as SoftButtonAreas to your 50-synaptics.conf or did you try the SoftButtonAreas settings via xinput only?\nFor me the the following (applied to my own 60-my-own-trackpad.conf which is recommended) is working:\nOption \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nThis is disabling the areas completely, changing the corresponding RightButtonAreaLeft, Right etc., and that is exactly what I wanted. Any other way except directly applying it via synclient on the terminal didn't work for me. To make sure the changes were set list your settings with:\nsynclient -l\n\nIf the areas still seem unchanged check the following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*RTCornerButton\n\n*RBCornerButton\n\n*LTCornerButton\n\n*LBCornerButton\n\n\nThis is what the synaptics man page says about it:\n\nOption \"RTCornerButton\" \"integer\"\n  Which mouse button is reported on a right top corner tap. Set to 0 to disable. Property: \"Synaptics Tap Action\"\n\nI had to apply these settings as well.\nIf all this won't work it should always be possible to swap the buttons via xmodmap. The following line swaps your right and middle button:\nxmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 3 2\"\n\nBut I don't like this one. It's hackish for this kind of issue. \n", "Q: Where can I put a user-defined shell function? I am planning to create a function that would simplify things for me. The function  would be something like\nfunction lazymode()\n{\necho \"Hello World!\";\n}\n\nso that when I use the command lazymode in the shell , it will output the Hello World!.\nWhat file should I put the user-defined function?\n\nA: The best choice would be ~/.bashrc file.\nYou can either write your shell function definitions directly in your ~/.bashrc file, or, if you have lots of them and don't want to clutter your ~/.bashrc file, you can put them all in another file of your choosing -- just be sure to source that file in your ~/.bashrc file. For example, if the file with your functions is named bash_functions, simply add in your ~/.bashrc file the lines:\nif [[ -f /path/to/bash_functions ]]; then\n    source /path/to/bash_functions\nfi\n\nor, equivalently:\nif [[ -f /path/to/bash_functions ]]; then\n    . /path/to/bash_functions\nfi\n\nwhere the . is just a symbolic representation of source.  The if test makes sure the file /path/to/bash_functions exists before trying to source it.  \nThis technique is very similar to establishing aliases in ~/.bashrc by creating a file called ~/.bash_aliases and using similar syntax to that above in ~/.bashrc to test for its existence and then source it.\n\nA: Here's an essential procedure for declaring a permanent function:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ~/.bashrc file in a text editor. Doesn't matter which text editor, so long as you know how to use it and so long as you open the /home/<username>/.bashrc \n\n*At the end of the ~/.bashrc declare your own function, for instance:\nfind_dirs(){\n    find \"$1\" -type d\n}\n\n\n*Save and close the file.\nThe ~/.bashrc file is read every time you open interactive shell (that is new terminal tab, login via ssh, or open TTY1 or other virtual console). This will not be available in script files, because ~/.bashrc is not read for non-interactive shells. It is also not available if you run bash with --norc option. \nIf you want the function to be available immediately in the currently open tab, use source ~/.bashrc command.\n\nFunctions take arguments just like regular commands. For example, $1 through $9 indicate the positional parameters when you call a function. In the example above find_dirs takes one positional parameter only, and would be called as find_dirs /etc.  You can also use $@ to refer to all positional parameters. Functions also accept redirection. You can call a function with find_dirs $1 > /dev/null;  we also could declare it as follows:\nfind_dirs(){\n    find \"$1\" -type d\n}\n\nNote from man bash: \"Functions are executed in the context of the current shell; no new process is created to interpret them\". That means that you also should be aware of functions having ability to alter your shell execution environment - change variables and terminal settings.\n\nA: Depends on the function. If it's just a super-simple one-liner like that you could create an alias or stick the function in ~/.bashrc (a file that bash loads when it starts).\nIf you're creating something a bit more meaty, it might make more sense to create its own executable script in ~/bin/ which won't exist by default (it's just a directory) but should be in your path. Remember for this the file will need to be executable (chmod +x filename) and start with a proper #!/bin/bash stanza.\nThe second route has some clear benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's easier to see what's available\n\n*A syntax error won't tank your profile\n\n*You don't need to keep re-sourcing your bash config if you change the script\n\n*It's available to any shell as long as the full path is used or ~/bin/ is in the path for that shell too (which it should be in most cases AFAIK).\n\n", "Q: can't use sudo but only su As root, I created a new user and added to sudo group with \nadduser myuser sudo\n\nbut when I try to sudo something I got the Sorry, try again. error.\nThe curious thing is that i can use su without any problem.\n(I'm on a vps with a fresh install of ubuntu server 12.04)\n\nA: Sorry, try again error means the password is wrong, this can be because changes have not been effected(logging in and out can solve this), or you are somehow entering the wrong details .\n\nA: With su you use the root password.

Because the cron job provides dynamic data, I would also want to set a cron job to empty the file contents (the file must still exist). I don't need help with cron, just the command which can help with emptying the file.\n\nA: To automate this you can use logrotate. Just create a configuration file for the file you want to be emptied, add other settings and you can have it empty every day automatically based on criteria you choose f.e everyday, or when file is bigger than etc.\nTake a look here on how to configure logrotate:\nhttp://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html\n\nA: The simplest way:\n> filename\n\nThis is a less obvious way and probably less readable in a shell script by others, but it's all you need.\nBecause > is not actually a really command (it is bash builtin) you can't use:\nsudo > filename\n\nwhen you don't have permissions on that file. But you can use:\nsudo bash -c \"> filename\"\n\n\nA: echo \"\" > foo_file is a simple way of doing that, it will replace all contents of foo_file with \"\" making it in this case, empty.\nYou can also use cat /dev/null > foo_file, that will read the null device and overwrite your file with nothing at all.\n\nA: There is a tool created for that purpose:\ntruncate -s 0 filename\n\nThis will clear the contents but it will still be the same file (the inode stays the same).\nSuppose you \"empty\" a file using the naive method of deleting and recreating the file: the new file will (usually) have a new inode.\nThis inode is important because some programs hold a handle to the file \"by inode\". Even after you deleted and recreated a file those programs will still have the old file with the old content. The program holds the old file via the old inode while your recreated empty file has a new inode.\nSome links to more details at the end of this answer.\n\nAnother way, maybe easier to remember:\necho -n > filename\n\nThis also keeps the same inode.\nNote that both truncate and echo -n are not defined by POSIX.\nFor POSIX compliance use cat /dev/null:\ncat /dev/null > filename\n\nYet another way, more obscure and probably not shell agnostic:\n> filename\n\n\nIf the file to truncate needs root privileges to write then the following lines will not work as you might expect:\n# following commands do not work\nsudo echo -n > filename\nsudo cat /dev/null > filename\nsudo > filename\n\nThis is because the redirection is done by the shell even before sudo is executed. That means that the write access to the file is done using the privileges of the user who runs the shell, not the privileges which will be granted by sudo.\nA workaround is to defer the redirection to a shell executed using sudo privileges like this:\nsudo sh -c \"echo -n > filename\"\n\nUsing truncate you do not need such a workaround because the write access is not done by the shell but by truncate which is executed by sudo using sudo privileges.\nsudo truncate -s 0 filename\n\n\nFor some gory details about programs holding the file open even if the file has been deleted you can read the following:\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2028874/what-happens-to-an-open-file-handler-on-linux-if-the-pointed-file-gets-moved-de\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/501963/how-to-recover-free-space-on-deleted-files-without-restarting-the-referencing-pr\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/182077/best-way-to-free-disk-space-from-deleted-files-that-are-held-open\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51019714/does-recreating-a-file-reuse-the-previous-inode\n", "Q: Run command if window is fullscreen?

Move through history until echo 1 appears and change it to echo 1 - changed, but DO NOT PRESS ENTER. If you now move further through your history, this line stays in its modified state and you can move away from and back to it. Now move to the line echo 2 and change it to echo 2 - changed, again don't press enter. In order to save the changes to these lines, select any command in history except for these two, and hit Ctrl+c.\nOf course, instead of modifying the history entry, you may also remove it which will result in an empty line at that entry. To delete the line currently displayed at the prompt, hit Ctrl+e (which jumps to the end of the line) followed by Ctrl+u (which deletes the text from the start of the line to the cursor).\nSee also https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/195668/what-can-cause-an-item-to-be-deleted-from-my-bash-history/195726#195726 for a more detailed explanation of the technical background.\nSimplest Way:\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl+r to search the command you want to delete/modify. \n\n*end to select the searched command to delete/modify\n\n*Delete or modify the selected command (don't press enter or ctrl + c)\n\n*up arrow(or ctrl+p) or down arrow(or ctrl+n) to select any other command.\n\n*ctrl+c That's it!\nNote:\nThis changes only the current session commands.

It's the number from from the start of the line which contain the history entry that you want to delete it.\nAnd to save the modifications to the history use:\nhistory -w\n\nSee more details in this guide. \n\nA: If you want to immediately delete it form the same terminal first you have to add the following to your ~/.bashrc file.\nPROMPT_COMMAND='history -a' \n\nand restart your terminal.\nYou can add it anywhere in .bashrc file .I have added as below along with other history related stuff.\n\nUsually during a bash session the executed commands are not written into .bash_history until the session is terminated hence PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a' enters the command then and there into .bash_history.\nNow whenever you make mistake or error in a command and want to delete it then and there just execute the following\nsed -i '$d' ~/.bash_history\n\nand tada it would be deleted.\nTo make it simpler you can alias it to something more simpler and use  it such as\nalias rh ='sed -i '\\''$d'\\'' ~/.bash_history'\n\nSo executing rh will remove the last executed command from history.\nThe above is temporary aliasing which only lasts for a session.To make it permanent or persistent add     \nalias rh = 'sed -i '\\''$d'\\'' ~/.bash_history' \n\nto .bashrc\nNOTE\nThere should not be any space on both sides of =\nIf You Dont Want to Alias then You could also do the following\nMake a commad name rh and place it in /bin directory: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a file say rh and paste following code, save and close: \nsed -i '$d' ~/.bash_history\n\n*Make rh executable and place it in /bin directory: \n chmod +x rh\n sudo cp rh /bin  \n\n*Now use rh command to delete recent command from history.\n\nA: If you are using \"set -o vi\" option in bash (very useful to search back with Escape key), then you can search for the line and delete the line with \"dd\" in the same way you do in \"vi\". \n\nA: I had a situation where I had superfluous entries in my bash history from a Yubikey- maybe 50 or so, matching 'ccccc.....'. Ideally, I wanted a way to delete entries matching a pattern, which I suppose you could do with sed or something, assuming your history ignores blanks. \nAnyway, I got lazy and ended up using vim, searching for 'cccc' and using 'dd' while cycling through every match.

(I know for sure that it is an older version, but I want to know the version number).  \n\n*I am trying to delete the older version ENTIRELY and again install the new libraries from source. Can anyone help me with this?   \n\n\nA: Why does the Synaptic Package Manager not show the latest versions?\nFrom Ubuntu Wiki – Stable Release Updates:\n\nOnce an Ubuntu release has been completed and published, updates for it are only released under certain circumstances, and must follow a special procedure called a \"stable release update\" or SRU. \n\nThis means that packages are often not kept up-to-date with active upstream sources.\nCan I do something to fix it?\nYou can compile and install your own recent version of ffmpeg and its libraries by following a step-by-step guide: Compile FFmpeg on Ubuntu, Debian, or Mint. This guide performs a local installation, so it will not interfere with repository packages or system files, but if you are compiling something that depends on the new libraries you may have to tell it where your new ffmpeg libraries are located.\nIf you are compiling many programs, or need several more recent packages than what is provided, then Ubuntu may not be the most efficient distro for you in the long run.\nHow can I find the version of the libraries that are already installed on my system?\nThe major version is present in the package name, such as libavcodec53.\nI am trying to delete the older version ENTIRELY and again install the new libraries from source.\nIf you want to perform a system installation that replaces the ffmpeg or libav-tools package and/or libraries then you can simply remove the existing packages, then compile ffmpeg, then install to system with checkinstall or some other method. See this old version of the previously mentioned guide that does all of that, but be aware that it is outdated and at the very least you may have to add --extra-libs=-ldl to your ffmpeg configure line.\nIf you want to perform a local installation then follow the current version of the compile guide.\n\nMisleading package names\nYou should be aware that the so-called \"ffmpeg\" from the repository is not actually from FFmpeg, but from a fork called libav. See Who can tell me the difference and relation between ffmpeg, libav, and avconv?\n\nA: This answer is to help newbies install the latest development libraries of FFmpeg and to WORK with them. I came to know it the hard way, that installing a development library is just the beginning. The real difficult part is to compile (with appropriate flags) and make an executable (successfully!) out of the source file.\n\n*\n\n*Follow the procedure given here :   Compile FFmpeg on Ubuntu, Debian, or Mint\nThe procedure in the above link is pretty straightforward (though it is lengthy and a little time consuming). You have to copy the commands and paste them in your terminal.\n\n*\n\n*The above procedure creates a local installation of the FFmpeg library. It is a static library. By local installation I mean that the system doesn't know anything about the library.\n\nThe information about types of libraries and how to use them can be found with the help of Google. This is enough to get you started : Types of Libraries. You can skip reading it if you are just concerned about getting the compilation of the source code using the libraries done.\n\n*\n\n*Now, this is the tough part. I had to try for hours, to get this part right. You need to let the compiler know about your FFmpeg library. You actually do that in the next step while giving it appropriate flags. But you need to do some preparations before the next step.\n\n\nCopy all the .pc files from /home/jsp99/ffmpeg_build/lib/pkgconfig and    paste them into /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\nSince copying and pasting in Ubuntu is not so easy, follow this link for instructions.\n\n\n*\n\n*To actually compile the source code and form an executable, type this command in the terminal :\n\n\ngcc -Wall -o module1.out -I/home/jsp99/ffmpeg_build/include\n-L/home/jsp99/ffmpeg_build/lib module1.c  $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libavformat libavcodec libswscale)\n\n\n\n/home/jsp99 is current user's home folder.\nmodule1.c is the name of my source file.\nmodule1.out is the name of the exectable file (output).\n\n", "Q: Can not remove sublime text 2 because of installing package control After setting up Sublime Text 2, I tried to install package control but I faced an error.

But under the covers, it is using the username.\nSo, you choose jim as your username, but install from your Windows Administrator account. This means your home directory will be /home/jim and your username jim and your Terminal prompt jim@ubuntu, but on the account login you will be prompted with Administrator. You can change this if you like by going to User Accounts Settings.\nThe reason for this weird behaviour is that the designer expected you would install under the account Jim and then automatically defaulted the username to jim. However, the designer didn't code for the case where the account was Bob and you installed as jim.\nBut note that the password is always the one entered when you installed Wubi. Make sure you use the one you had to enter twice, regardless of the account name you're greeted with.\nNote: when you enter a password in the terminal, it automatically suppresses output for security purposes.

If you can boot into grub, then during Grub, press \"e\", that will bring up the editor, locate to where it says ro and change it to rw.\nYou have to do this everytime you boot.\nTo make the change permanent, run gksu gedit /etc/grub.d/10_lupin after booting (replace gedit with your favourite editor, use sudo nano /etc/grub.d/10_lupin if you are in the tty), locate the line which says\nlinux   ${rel_dirname}/${basename} root=${LINUX_HOST_DEVICE} loop=${loop_file_relative} ro ${args}\n\nand change the ro to rw, like this:\nlinux   ${rel_dirname}/${basename} root=${LINUX_HOST_DEVICE} loop=${loop_file_relative} rw ${args}\n\nSave the file, and run sudo update-grub.\nThis will solve the problem about the missing root folder.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 and Reliance Netconnect USB Modem I have recently procured a Reliance Netconnect+ USB connection for accessing internet.

Previously there existed a script which had to be executed with root privileges (I do not know if such a script exists anymore). \nSimilarly, as far as I know, Reliance netconnect also supplied a script which worked to create a dash (I don't really know what that is), at least in Mint 13 (Yes I understand that this is an Ubuntu forum). \nAs far as my understanding goes, these Huawei devices need to be first read by a Microsoft Windows PC and then they are detected in linux-boxes. \nYou could check your network manager script or configuration file for the top taskbar to display an icon for wireless modem. Also, enable mobile networking. It wouldn't provide you a dash like in windows[that tataphoton.exe which flashes everytime you connect it] because ifconfig -a reads the device as a PPP0 device. So, you will be required to configure it only via network manager. \nGoing to network manager menu where you add the mobile networking device, give username and password to connect after you select your country and provider.

You can remove the ascii readable part on the right if needed using -p and you can revert (change ascii input to binary data) using the -r function.  Here are some simple example uses:\nConverting to hex with ascii view:\necho example | xxd\n\nConverting to a hexdump (no ascii view on the right):\necho example | xxd -p\n\nConverting from a hexdump back to binary data:\necho 746573740a | xxd -p -r\n\nYou can get much more complex with this in shell scripts.  I have actually used this and \"dd\" to scan for specific sequences and modify them in a predefined fashion all from a shell script using nothing but bash, dd, and xxd.  You actually don't need dd for this either as you can \"seek\" to a specific location and write to that location the byte sequence you need.  The biggest advantage to this approach is its easily scriptable.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I was dissatisfied with all of the answers here. I was looking for a hex editor that allowed for me to create my own binary files (aka insert mode) and could handle very large files.\nI came across tweak, which fulfills both of these requirements, as well as the OPs.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Tweak supports insert mode (not particularly useful if you're editing an executable file or a filesystem image, but can be extremely\n  handy in other file formats such as PNG).\n  \n*Cutting, copying and pasting within the file you are editing is extremely efficient. No matter how big the chunk of data you are\n  moving around - even if it's a 200Mb section of a CD image - Tweak\n  will always perform the operation effectively instantly.\n  \n*Tweak supports lazy loading of the input file: rather than sucking it all into memory straight away, it simply remembers which parts of\n  the editing buffer are copies of which parts of the input file and\n  refers to the file on disk when it needs to. Tweak only has to take\n  significant time when you genuinely need it to read the entire file.\n  The only two operations with this property are searching, and saving\n  the modified version of the file to disk. Everything else is instant.\n  \n\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu Server 12.04 without losing my Windows 7 files?

I'm designing a security sensitive setup for a client. The situation is as follows:\nSensitive information has to be stored on a server that might be accessed by unauthorized personnel. There is no way to secure the hardware in a way that it is 100% secure.\nHere my approach:\nI'm encrypting the root machine with cryptsetup/luks, then I'm encrypting an image with cryptsetup/luks and mounting it to be a virtual machine's harddrive. The virtual machine has again an encrypted root FS.\nNow I want to prevent anyone from accessing the machine's hardware while it is running. \nI want to detect unknown devices that are plugged into it, like a USB-thumbdrive or a Firewire device, etc.\nIs there a way to detect unknown devices elegantly in udev? So far i've only found ways to define actions for devices I know. But I want to define an action for when an unknown device connects.\nThanks for your input.\n\nA: If you want something like this you need to treat -all- devices as suspicious and at any time any device gets inserted ask for something only the owner of that device can know. You can not skip this for a device you believe has been approved before since the user that inserted it does not have to be the same person. \n\nIs there a way to detect unknown devices elegantly in udev?\n\nudev does not understand \"unknown devices\": it either understands all or none USB/firewire devices due to there being a entry in /dev/. Unknown to udev would mean the device does not work in that system. And ID_VENDOR_ID and ID_MODEL_ID do not allow you to see a difference between 2 devices of the same make and model.\nA possible method:\nSee https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Execute_on_USB_insert for a basic script that gets executed on inserting a device. This will force any device to show a menu where the user needs to verify it may have access. \nThe rule in the link ...\nACTION==\"add\", RUN+=\"/usr/bin/exdongle run /media/%k-%E{dir_name}\"\n\nwill work on any device that tries to mount in /media/ and will start script \"exdongle\" (the script might need some tweaking since it has a disclaimer). \n\nWhat you consider \"unknown\" is a specific device that is known to Linux as USB. So if USB support is present all USB devices are treated equally. Devices have a vendor and product id but those are unique per make/model and not per USB device. \n\nThe only USB device that has a unique ID is a dongle ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_protection_dongle ). Those tend to come with software for verification (so also not for headless systems) but you might be able to save the identification to a file and script something like above to test against a known set of id's. \n", "Q: How can I crash my MBR on ubuntu server How can I crash my MBR on ubuntu server.I am trying to crash my bacula system and when I was going through some documents I saw that I can do this by crashing the master boot record.Anybody to help\n\nA: As I explained in your last iteration of this question, just test it with new hardware.

First make a Bacula Rescue disk, see the Disaster Recovery Using BaculaRescueChapter chapter of this manual. Second, you run a full backup of all your files on all partitions. Third, you run an Verify InitCatalog Job on the same FileSet, which effectively makes a record of all the files on your system. Fourth, you run a Verify Catalog job and assure yourself that nothing has changed (well, between an InitCatalog and Catalog one doesn't expect anything). Then do the unthinkable, write zeros on your MBR (master boot record) wiping out your hard disk. Now, restore your whole system using your Bacula Rescue disk and the Full backup you made, and finally re-run the Verify Catalog job. You will see that with the exception of the directory modification and access dates and the files changed during the boot, your system is identical to what it was before you wiped your hard disk.

That way, the broken EFI will launch GRUB, thinking it's the Windows boot loader. Boot Repair will also adjust GRUB configuration to launch Windows from its new name. It's possible to do this manually; Boot Repair just makes it easier to do it.\nAlternatively, you could return the computer for a refund and buy something with a less-broken EFI. In the long run, if you've got an EFI that's broken badly enough to need this second (ugly hack) solution, that's the better solution.

If we return defective products, manufacturers are more likely to take notice of the problem and fix it.\n\nA: If you use your command line for efibootmgr, it leaves the Windows bootloader in first place.

If I install from \nthe USB, will subsequent Ubuntu startups from my hard drive be quicker, without all the messaging? Or is there a problem with my USB and I need to re-create the USB?\n\nA: Yep, Ubuntu installed on a hard drive starts under a minute or faster (this site reports 18 seconds). Installed on an SSD -- and I can tell this from my own experience -- it boots up in a few seconds. Furthermore, additional services loaded at boot time or applications loaded in a GUI session can be disabled to shave off a few seconds.\n\nA: I can definitely vouch for this one, having used both I find my SSD is much much faster. Last time I was running it I checked the differences. They clocked in at: \nUSB Stick : ~40s\nSSD : ~4-5s  \nAs for the scrolling text you could add splash to your grub file at /etc/default/grub to display a wallpaper instead. Don't forget to back this file up however before making any changes. You would change the line too : \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nThen to make the changes permanent run : \nupdate-grub \n\nHowever I would advise doing a test boot before making the changes permanent. To do this just select Ubuntu and press e and the grub screen on start-up. Edit the file as above and then press f10 to start. This way you can try the changes before making them permanent. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 13.04 in a different partition than Windows I need help installing Ubuntu 13.04 to my computer.  I have downloaded Ubuntu 13.04 (64-bit) and burned it to a DVD.  I test drove the new distribution and it worked great, but installing it poses a bit of a problem for me (I'm an inexperienced Ubuntu/Linux user).  Here's what I want to do.\nI want to be able to dual-boot my system like I did when I had Ubuntu 12.04 installed on it. I previously used Wubi to install Ubuntu and it allowed me to install Ubuntu onto my D:\\ partition. \nI have two partitions on my HDD. The first is C:\\ and it is where Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit) is installed (please note that my machine's processor is an AMD 64-bit and that is why I downloaded the 64-bit flavor of 13.04). The second is D:\\ and it was where Ubuntu 12.04 used to reside prior to trying to install 13.04. \nWhen I tried installing 13.04 alongside of Windows Vista, it does not allow me to pick the partition I want to install to, so I tried \"Something Else\" and I could not get the installation to work there either.  Here's what I tried: \nI set up sdb as the partition I wanted to install Ubuntu in and set the mount point to / (I don't even know if that is right), and then it told me that I didn't have a swap partition/space, so I reduced the size of sdb and made another partition (sdc) out of the remaining space, but I didn't know how to label it as \"Swap\" nor do I know where to set the mount point of sdc so I'm stuck.  \nI just thought of one thing and that is could I go and delete the partitions I have set up for Ubuntu using Disk Management in Windows and then extend Windows into that space and then try installing Ubuntu alongside Windows Vista?  Would that be the easiest way to do it?\nCan anyone help me out here?\n\nA: First off, in Linux every hard drive has its own letter going from 'sda' to 'sdb' to 'sdc' and so on.\nBut for every partition, you will get a 'sda1', 'sda2', 'sda3', and so on for each partition on a hard drive.\nThere are two ways to fix this, the automatic way and the manual way.\nIn the end, they do exactly the same thing. If you know what you are doing and want to spare some time, go with the manual way\nThe Automatic way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all files from D:/ to C:/ as a backup\n\n*remove the D:/ partition and expand C:/ over where D:/ was before.\n\n*Boot the live USB again and select \"Install Ubuntu alongside windows\" and set how big you want\n\n\nThe Manual way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all files from D:/ to C:/ as a backup\n\n*Boot the live USB\nNow, in Linux, these partitions have different names!\n\n*select 'Something else'\n\n*Delete the partition after windows (which was called D:/ by windows) and expand it to the end of the hard drive except for 2-8gb of free space that we are going to make swap later on.\n\n*Format that partition as Ext4 and set the mount point as /\n\n*Make the last partition out of the remaining 2-8gb of space, and format it as SWAP.\n\n*In the dropdown menu on the bottom that's called something like 'bootloader location', set it to the correct hard drive (This will be the same as the windows or ubuntu or swap partition name but without a number, for example,/dev/sda, /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc)\n\n*Simply continue installing ubuntu!\nI hope this helps, and just place a comment if you encounter problems!\n\nA: First of all, you probably mean sda1, sda2, and so on, not sdb and sdc. But anyways, here's what you can do:\nOption 1:\nFollow the exact same steps you did, and when you get to the swap part, you'll need to pick the \"Use as swap area\" to set the swap partition. Here's a screenshot:\n\nOption 2:\nYou can let Ubuntu take care of all of this for you.\nLeave a free, unpartitioned space on your hard drive. Now, when you start the installation of Ubuntu, you'll get an option that reads \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Vista\". Picking that option will instruct Ubuntu to install in that unpartitioned space (it'll create the partitions it needs, along with swap), without harming any other partitions. So no, this option won't ask you which partition to install to, it automatically detects that there is free space on the hard disk, and it installs itself there.\n", "Q: How to set battery charging thresholds on T420s I have a ThinkPad T420s and would like to expand the battery service life (not maximize time the laptop can run off a battery)\nI have tp-smapi-dkms and sysfsutils installed, and when I run:\n$ ll /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    0 Sep 12 08:00 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root    0 Sep 12 07:59 ../\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 barcoding\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:26 charging_max_current\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:26 charging_max_voltage\n\n...\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 power_avg\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 power_now\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 remaining_capacity\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 remaining_charging_time\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 remaining_percent\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:26 remaining_percent_error\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 remaining_running_time\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:26 remaining_running_time_now\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 serial\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:17 start_charge_thresh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 state\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:00 stop_charge_thresh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 temperature\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 12 08:15 voltage\n\nSo there should be start_charge_thresh and stop_charge_thresh available, I can set when the battery stops charging with:\n$ echo 80 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh\n80\n$ echo 80 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh\n80\n\nBut setting when it should start charging fails:\n$ echo 40 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh \n40\n$ cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh \ncat: /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh: No such device or address\n\nHow is this possible?

I am missing the ability to maximize windows by dragging them to the top of the screen with the mouse. Is it possible to enable on Lubuntu? If it is, will it offset the resource savings that I got from choosing the LXDE desktop?\n\nA: I don't know the \"cost\" in terms of resource usage because I don't use it, but there is an additional piece of software that you could install to get what you ask for. It is called Opensnap and a write-up and installation directions are at Opensnap (Aerosnap with mouse).  \n\nAerosnap is a lacking feature of the Openbox window manager, which\n  handles Lubuntu's windows, so we need to draw upon a \"keystroke trick\"\n  (see Aerosnap article) or use a 3rd party app. And there's a handy\n  program (thanks to lawl) that will do that, called Opensnap.\n\nThe impression I get from the github page is that you may need to install wmctrl as well.\nAs I said, I haven't used it.

However, a file 01proxy was present in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ which contained the line Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://PROXY:PORT\";. Commenting the line with # (or deleting the file) worked for me. This means that other files in apt.conf and apt.conf.d may contain proxy settings and I'd suggest greping proxy (with -i flag) information from those two folders to know if the apt service uses one.\nNote that @Prashant Adlinge answer always works in that case as it bypasses any configuration file.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on an old MacBook without a CD or USB drive? I have an old MacBook 1,1 here and want to install Ubuntu on it. However the disk reader is broken. This leaves me with a bootable USB, however this is not recognized when I boot with EFI (if that makes sense). Is there any way that I can install Ubuntu without a CD or USB drive?\n\nA: I had the same problem with the optical drive in my MacBook from late 2006 after pouring milk into it late one night and did get a working install this way. Booting from USB is hit or miss with Macs (both PowerPC and Intel). I have made it work on an iBook Clamshell after running late versions of Tiger (but not after running earlier versions), but I have never been able to do it on an Intel Mac, except for a Mac OS X install disk from an USB optical drive (but not Ubuntu live dvds from the same drive).\nThis is a method to install Ubuntu on your MacBook using FireWire Disk mode. You will need another Mac with FireWire and a FireWire 400 cable. If the other Mac has FireWire 800, you will need a FireWire 400 to 800 cable. And you will need a disk to backup your Mac OS X install. (You also need this backup of Mac OS X to extract the firmware for your iSight webcam after the install.)\nMaybe borrow another Mac from somebody if you don't have two. The other Mac must run Mac OS X 10.4.7 or later (PowerPC or Intel doesn't matter), since otherwise it will not be able to \"see\" the disk in the MacBook. (PowerPC Macs used APT, not GUID partition tables, so only after the Intel transition did the operating system get the ability to see GUID disks.)\nWhat you basically do is install the Live DVD to one partition and install onto the rest of the disk from that partition. If you want to dual boot, you can restore your Mac OS X install to the partition we used for the Live DVD after installing Ubuntu on the other partition, but if you just want Ubuntu, then keep the other partion as a restore partition. Before partitioning, you will need to know if you want to dual boot or not to decide how large the partition you will use for the Live DVD should be. If you want to dual boot, you will have to make it as large as you want your later Mac OS X partition. If not, then it will just need to be large enough to fit the live .iso.\n(I am not using the English localisation of neither Mac OS X nor Ubuntu, so the exact worthing of buttons and such might be slightly off in these instructions, but the gist of it is right.)\nHere is how you do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your Mac OS X install to an external FireWire or USB drive. Use Carbon Copy Cloner from Bombich software (not Time Machine) if you want to dual boot. (We need an exact clone that we can restore to one of the partitions on your MacBook later, and since we can not use the Mac OS X Install disk to restore from a Time Machine backup since the optical drive doesn't work, we need an exact clone that we can restore with Disk tools from the other Mac.) NB: If you want to dual boot, make shure that your Backup does not take up more room than the size you will use for the Mac OS X partition later. (Delete all unnessecary stuff from your home folder if it is too large.)\n\n*Download and install rEFInd and restart your MacBook twice (not one time, but two times) and shut it down again.\n\n*On the other Mac, download Ubuntu live DVD 14.04 32 bit or 14.10 32 bit. After it is downloaded, click it and press Commando+I to get the \"Get info\" window. You need the information in this window later.\n\n*Connect the FireWire cable to the other Mac and start your MacBook while holding down the T key. A FireWire symbol appears (looking like a flux capasitor) and on the other Mac, your hard drive appears in the Finder.\n\n*Open Disk tools. (In the Tools folder inside the Program folder.)\n\n*Select your MacBook's disk in the left panel and click the partition tab.\n\n*Make a new partition by hitting the + on the lower left side. Drag the dividing line between the partitions upwards or downards untill it is the size you want. a) Single boot. If you want to just have Ubuntu on the MacBook, you will have to make it the size of the live iso file we downloaded earlier (look at the \"Get info\" window now). Add an extra gigabyte just to be shure (since sometimes a gigabyte is 1024 MB and sometimes it is 1000 MB). b) Dual boot. If you want to dual boot with Mac OS X, you will need to make your partition the size you want your Mac OS X partition to become later. Remember that this has to be bigger than the backup clone you made in 1 to work.\n\n*Make the new partition MS-DOS (FAT32) formatted by writing a name in the field to the right of the partition layout and selecting MS-DOS and then \"delete\" (or \"Partition\". Can't remember exactly).\n\n*Drag the .iso file from the Downloads folder into the left panel of Disk tools.\n\n*Click the \"restore\" tab and drag the Ubuntu live iso into the \"From...\" field and the new partition you made in 7 into the \"To...\" field and click \"Restore\".\n\n*Quit Disk Tools.\n\n*Eject the two partitions from the MacBook in the finder by clicking the eject buttons on the right side of their names.\n\n*Shut down your MacBook. (Hold down the power key untill the MacBook shuts down if it doesn't shut down immideatly.)\n\n*Disconnect the FireWire cable.\n\n*Restart your MacBook.\n\n*Choose \"Windows\" when the rEFInd window shows up. It thinks it is windows because the disk is formatted FAT32.\n\n*Choose install and go through the usual questions. (Tap to click is on by default, so be careful with your trackpad.) I usually choose not to update the installer, as it often seems to fail for me, but check the Fluendo restricted multimedia package, that is really nice to have. When you come to the place where you should choose where to install, choose \"Manual setup\" (or whatever it is called). DO NOT choose erase the whole disk and install (since the live iso you are running is also on the disk).\n\n*Delete the other partition of the disk (the HFS+-formatted one) and make a Swap partition the same size as your RAM and another EXT4 partition that you make your root partition. Press \"format\" after setting the disk up as you like. (DO NOT repartition the FAT32 partition or do anything else with it at this time.)\n\n*Install and when asked, choose to install grub on your root partition. (The EXT4-partition.)\n\n*Restart.\n\n*Dual boot only. Shut down your MacBook. Connect your Backup USB or FireWire disk to the other Mac. Reconnect your MacBook to the other Mac with the FireWire calbe and start the MacBook while holding down T. Choose \"Ignore\" when asked what to do with partitions Mac OS X can not read. Open Disk Tools (Apple menu->Recent items->Disk tools) and format the FAT32-partition to Mac OS X extended (choose the partition in the left panel (not the disk, only the partition) and use the delete tab to name it and make it Mac OS X Extended (Journaled). Go to the Restore tab. Drag your Backup disk to the \"From...\" field and the newly made Mac OS Extended (HFS+) disk into the \"To...\" field and press the \"restore\" button. Quit Disk Tools when it is finished restoring. Eject the other partitions and disks in the Finder and disconnect the FireWire cable. Restart your MacBook and at the rEFInd window you will now find Mac OS X and Linux.\n\n\nThen you need to install firmware for the isight camera and fan control. (See my blog post for an explanation of how to do this.)\n\nA: Yes you can. You can use unetbootin\nWhat you need to do is make a \"frugal install\" on your local hard disk.\nYou can read the section \"Hard Disk Install Mode\" to see how you can do it here\n", "Q: Bumblebee + Intel HD graphics + GeForce GT 555M + Unity / compiz problem I have a mx14r1 alienware and I am using Ubuntu 13.04 raring with unity 7.0.

It is for my father and has to be user friendly. So I need a way to start programs graphically like by the \"start button\" equivalent to windows. The default programs are listed in the start menu, but I just installed wine and cannot find it in the menu. Where can I find programs that are not listed without using the terminal? Is there an equivalent to the ubuntu dash?\n\nA: I installed Lubuntu 12.04 yesterday, and I just installed wine using sudo apt-get install wine, and once done I was able to find it on the Lubuntu menu.  See image below.\n\n\nA: To answer \"Where can I find programs that are not listed without using the terminal? Is there an equivalent to the ubuntu dash?\":  \nA normal Lubuntu installation has the \"run\" feature available by pressing Alt+F2. This gives you a small window to type what you want to run.  \n\nAs you type, a drop down appears with auto-complete suggestions.  \nI would think that that is a low-fat \"Dash\" with the difference that this method only provides auto-completion whereas the suggestions in Ubuntu's \"Dash\" aren't purely auto-complete but also suggest applications based, I guess, on the Name entries in .desktop files. \nWriting from memory, starting to type \"text editor\" in the Dash would quickly suggest gedit. Doing the same in Lubuntu's \"Run\" window gives you nothing even though there is a text editor, Leafpad, installed by default. In other words, Lubuntu's \"Run\" responds to exact strings included in the actual executable's name, the name you'd enter in a terminal (ignoring aliases). Also, note that the string we enter needs to start from the beginning. On my system, gal gives me galculator as the only match whereas alculator returns nothing. \n\n\nA: I have installed Lubuntu and Wine in it serveral times. From my expirence there are no two Lubuntu installs that are exactly same. For Wine in particular, it sometimes shows up in menu, sometimes not, sometimes it only shows after two or three restarts. However, you do not really that Wine menu. Right-click on Windows exes, always contains an option to lauch via Wine.\n", "Q: How to connect a projector to my Ubuntu laptop?

It's strangely hard to find any documentation on accessing geolocation information for Ubuntu Touch specifically and even Qt5 more generally. The Qt Mobility APIs provided this in Qt4, and they seem to have been split into separate libraries in Qt5. These libraries were apparently removed from the Qt 5 distribution and are now considered  optional add-on modules. As they are now \"add-ons,\" the Qt website doesn't seem to publish their documentation anymore. There are Ubuntu packages for them, but installing the SDK doesn't actually pull them in. So it is unclear if they will be available on the phone or not.\nThe correct package seems to be qtdeclarative5-qtlocation-plugin , which can be accessed in Qml with import QtLocation 5.0\nTrying to simply get latitude and longitude has been an exercise in futility.

I've been reading a PDF and selected File > Open Containing folder option.  \nThis message appeared: \nFailed to execute child process \"nemo\" (Permission denied)\n\nWhy did this happen?\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: This problem appears to be because AppArmor is restricting what evince can do. A work-around is to disable AppArmor for evince:\nsudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.evince /etc/apparmor.d/disable/usr.bin.evince\nsudo /etc/init.d/apparmor restart\n\nFor more discussion of this issue, check out this link.\n\nA: As OSE pointed out, this problem is due to AppArmor is restricting the programs that evince can start. You can add nemo to the list of applications Evince is allowed to launch by editing /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.evince (You'll need root privileges)\nFind the Section of that file that looks like this:\n  # By default, we won't support launching a terminal program in Xterm or\n  # KDE's konsole.

If Windows 7 disk is the only one in the motherboard, it boots fine ( well after repairing it), but not in the two disk configuration. It's been days now searching all over, I've tried Boot-repair, I've edited the windows entry in the grub menu (using ntldr($root)/bootmgr) but no luck. \nSo my question is, is the ubuntu GPT partitioned disk an issue here, \"confusing\" Win 7, even though it is working in compatibility mode ( bios_grub flag on )? And how can I boot Win 7 from Grub2?\nThanks.\n--\nUPDATE.\nAfter much tinkering I found the culprit - one of the data disks (old IDE) uses an IDE->SATA converter which works only in MASTER Mode, (using a jumper on the converter itself), and this mode causes the Windows 7 (on another disk) to not boot, btw the motherboard has only SATA ports, no IDE. So I'm left with no options, either use this IDE disk or use Win 7, but not both. Whereas Ubuntu boots fine in any possible disks' configuration.\nSo I might just go replace this IDE disk with another genuine SATA disk and be done with it.\n\nA: I booted XP on a MBR disk and various Ubuntu's from 10.10 to 12.04 on gpt drives without issue with old BIOS sytem.\nSome BIOS have issues with drive mapping. Grub (and Windows?) consider the boot drive to be hd0 as that is from BIOS. When you chain load from grub it usually maps drives to make Windows then think it booted from hd0, even though it is hd1 from BIOS. But because of mapping issues, the only solution I have seen is to install grub to the MBR of the Windows drive. Then that drive is hd0 from BIOS and no mapping is required. Ubuntu will then boot just fine from other drive.\nThe new UEFI using a BIOS emulation mode just may not work with grub's old mapping.\n", "Q: Practical number of concurrent LXC limit on one node Is there any practical limit on the number of concurrent LXC containers to run on one box. \nObviously, this depend on the node spec (cpu, ram,..) but really what I am wondering is the cost of running a process directly on the os vs running the same process in dedicated container on the same box? If you have to put a number on the overheard difference, what is that over head? Is this a good way to figure out the maximum number of lxc container you should run on one server?\n\nA: As was said above, the overhead is minimal. Switching namespaces usually comes with no overhead (those fields already exist even for host processes), so the main overhead comes from the few extra resources that need to be created by LXC, typically 4-5 bind-mounts, maybe a couple of tmpfs mounts, two VETH devices and a loopback device.\nAs libraries will typically be shared between containers, even starting init and a bunch of other processes doesn't cost that much resources.\nAll that to say, it's pretty hard to answer your question :)\nIf you take a single process and compare it running on the host or running in a container, the overhead for that specific process will be 0. The actual LXC overhead comes from that process' parent and additional resources the process may use (network devices, ...).\nAnyway, I haven't done any crazy benchmarking recently, but a few months back I managed to run around a thousand of simple apache2 containers complete with an init system on a simple Pentium4 box with 4GB of RAM. Those containers were sharing their rootfs to make optimal use of shared memory but everything started fine nonetheless.\nOh and about the pid_max limit, it's not really a limit as this can be bumped all the way to 2^64 nowadays (at least on 64bit systems), so the 32768 limit is something of the past.\n\nA: The overhead is very low and you can run a very high number of containers that doesn't do anything, but that also wouldn't be very interesting. How many useful containers you can run in your system, depends on how you define useful. You'll have to test real use cases and see. \nOne practical limit, though, is the number of pids allowed. You can see this by looking at /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max. But it's probably not a useful number, for the reasons explained above. \n", "Q: Running a database in LXC If you need to run your databases in lxc, what happen to your data files? Do you have access to the data file on the host os? I guess the processes show up in the gust os process but who about the the files given that lxc has its own file system?\nAny other consideration to run your db inside lxc?\n\nA: LXC is similar to OpenVZ (OS level virtualization), in short LXC uses host OS file system directly. So the containers' file system (database data files) is accessible from the host anyway (Btrfs is recommended to take advantage of snapshot features).\nIf you consider using LXC, definitely take a look at Docker which is a nice wrapper for LXC (like Vagrant for VirtualBox) which makes it a lot easier and user-friendly. in addition, there are plenty of pre-built container templates ready for use.\n", "Q: Is it possible to trace the add-relation hooks in debug-hooks window?

This now happens every single time.  It is imperative that I get it sorted.  The strange thing is that it behaves initially then starts to hang after several hours.  I perused logs previously and nothing stood out.  \nFrom the auth.log, I can see that it has allowed me in, but still I get nothing back on the client side:\nSep 20 12:47:50 cbear sshd[25376]: Accepted publickey for tfergeson from 10.1.10.14 port 54631 ssh2\nSep 20 12:47:50 cbear sshd[25376]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user tfergeson by (uid=0)\n\nUPDATES:\nStill occurring even after setting UseDNS no and commenting out #session optional pam_mail.so standard noenv\nThis does not appear to be a network/dns related issue, as all services running on the machine are as responsive and accessible as ever, with the exception of sshd.\nAny thoughts on where to start?  \n\nA: From the SshAccess page on the GNU Savannah documentation wiki:\n\nA problem can arise when you are trying to connect from behind a NAT router using OpenSSH. During session setup, after the password has been given, OpenSSH sets the TOS (type of service) field in the IP datagram. Some routers are known to choke on this. The effect is that your session hangs indefinitely after you gave your password. Here is the example output from such an ssh session:\nuser@localhost:~$ ssh -vvv {user-name}@cvs.savannah.gnu.org\nOpenSSH_4.7p1 Debian-8ubuntu1.2, OpenSSL 0.9.8g 19 Oct 2007\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\n[...]\nEnter passphrase for key '{homedir}/.ssh/id_rsa':\ndebug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA\ndebug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).\n[...]\ndebug2: fd 5 setting TCP_NODELAY\ndebug2: callback done\ndebug2: channel 0: open confirm rwindow 0 rmax 32768\n\nand from here on the session hangs.\nThe fix is to make ssh send all its traffic via netcat, because netcat\n  won't set the TOS field. For this to work, you need to have netcat\n  installed. You can test this by entering at the command line:\nuser@localhost:~$ which nc\n\nand if you get a path back, like:\n/bin/nc\n\nthen you probably have netcat installed. For the very cautious, you\n  could also issue:\nuser@localhost:~$ nc -h\n\nand look at the upcoming help text. If you don't have netcat, you can\n  find it at http://netcat.sourceforge.net/. You may also want to try\n  the packaging system which comes with your operating system\n  distribution.\nOnce you found that you have netcat installed, issue the following\n  command to test whether the netcat route solves your problem:\nssh -o \"ProxyCommand nc %h %p\" {user-name}@cvs.savannah.gnu.org\n\nwhere {user-name} is your savannah login name. For a successfull\n  login, you should get an output similar to this (with no hanging, i.e.\n  you get a prompt afterwards):\nuser@localhost:~$ ssh -o \"ProxyCommand nc %h %p\" {user-name}@cvs.savannah.gnu.org\nEnter passphrase for key '{home-dir}/.ssh/id_rsa': \nLast login: {datetime} from {ip-adr} \nYou tried to execute: \nSorry, you are not allowed to execute that command. \nConnection to cvs.savannah.gnu.org closed. \nuser@localhost:~$\n\nIf you find that your login works via the netcat route, then you can\n  make it permanent by adding a directive to the ssh config file\n  ~/.ssh/config (or, if that file doesn't exist, create it):\nProxyCommand nc %h %p\n\nHere's an example ssh config file in a user's home folder\n  (/home/user/.ssh/config):\n# This is the ssh client user configuration file.  See\n# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for\n# this user, and the values can be changed on the command line.\n#\n# Configuration data is parsed as follows:\n#  1. command line options\n#  2. user-specific file\n#  3. system-wide file\n# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.\n# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the\n# configuration file, and defaults at the end.\n#\n# Directive to overcome TOS issue with our NAT router. During session setup,\n# OpenSSH sets the TOS (type of service) field after the user has submitted\n# the password. Some routers are known to choke on this, with the result\n# that the session hangs during buildup. As workaround we send our traffic\n# via netcat which doesn't set the TOS field.\nProxyCommand nc %h %p\n\nIt's advisable to put the comments as well, otherwise six months later you may find yourself wondering what that directive is all about??\nYou could also add this directive to your global ssh config file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config), but this change would be system wide, and not all users on your system may appreciate that change.\n\n\nA: As ridiculous as this sounds, the only workaround I have at this time is to schedule a nightly reboot.  Luckily, this workaround is acceptable only because it is a development machine, had it been a production machine I would be in trouble.\nI hate this, but wanted to be sure that others who find this thread know I have no solution.  Added this to the root crontab for a nightly reboot at 4 am:\n0 4 * * * /sbin/shutdown -r +5\n\n\nA: I had the problem behind a NAT with ssh. I tried \"mosh\" with ssh options and everything works just perfect. Install\nmosh\n\nA: I had gnome-keyring-daemon freeze on me sitting at 100% CPU on Ubuntu 18.04. \nsudo killall -9 gnome-keyring-daemon\n\nFixed it. ...For now\n\nA: ssh -o IPQoS=0 x.acme.com should tell openssh to stop setting the QoS field that's being choked on.\n\nA: For me, the issue was that I was using my server's public IP when I was on LAN.\nMaybe someone finds this useful.\n", "Q: How to install Canon printer/scanner drivers (deb.tar.gz file)? I have a Canon MG2220 multifunction printer that I would like to use with Ubuntu 13.04 (which I just installed).  There are no print drivers available in the Ubuntu Software Center, so I downloaded some Linux drivers from Canon's Asia website.  They are:\n\n\n*\n\n*scangearmp-mg2200series-2.00-1-deb.tar.gz\n\n*cnijfilter-mg2200series-3.80-1-deb.tar.gz\n\n\nI have found how to install \".tar.gz\" files, but this one has \".tar.gz\" in front of the \".deb\", and I am concerned about doing anything that may screw up my system.\nCan I use the same method for installing \".deb.tar.gz\" as \".tar.gz\" by following these instructions I found on Ask Ubuntu?\n\nA: Here's what is going on:\nA .tar.gz file is a compressed file, similar to a Windows .zip.  Some programs come as source code packed into a .tar.gz file, which you then use the instructions that you found for.\nHowever, what you have is a .deb file, which installs a program on your computer without having to compile it.  This deb file is packed inside a .tar.gz (often referred to as a tarball), which means that you first uncompress it and then execute it with a program called dpkg.  Run the following commands:\ntar -xzvf filename.deb.tar.gz filename.deb\nsudo dpkg -i filename.deb\n\nSubstitute \"filename\" for the name of your file without file extensions (hint: you can start typing in the name of an existing file and then press TAB to have the command prompt autocomplete it for you).  So, if you had a file named blender.deb.tar.gz, you would type the following:\ntar -xzvf blender.deb.tar.gz blender.deb\nsudo dpkg -i blender.deb\n\nIf you don't want to mess around with changing folders through the command prompt then just put the files in your home folder, and then run the above commands.\n\nA: Just right-click the file and select \"Extract here\". That will give you a folder with a file named \"something.deb\". Double-click that file and you'll go to the Ubuntu Software Center where you can install it. Should be no need for any commandline stuff, unless you prefer to use commands rather than graphical tools. \n\nA: My printer is up and running.  I extracted the files by right mouse clicking on the .deb file folders and then I went into the folder titled \"Packages\" and double clicked on them and it opened up Ubuntu Software Center and I was able to install the drivers that way.  I appreciate everyone who helped me on this issue.  Sincerely, Dennis Primm\n\nA: After you extract the file it will just be a .deb file. Then you just type this in the command line:\nsudo dpkg -i foo.deb \nWhere \"foo.deb\" is your file. \n", "Q: How can I encrypt a file with the Serpent encryption algorithm? I would like to encrypt a file using a symmetric key algorithm.  AES is a common algorithm, but I don't quite trust it, and I heard that Serpent is a very strong alternative.  How can I encrypt/decrypt a file with Serpent, preferably through a command line?\n\nA: if you are really concerned about the security of your computer's files and directories then you should try encrypting with triple encryption algorithm AES-Twofish-Serpent. \nThere is a great tutorial detailing the steps needed to encrypt both individual files and also directories. It is too detailed to post here and also I do not have permission to copy the content.\nThe steps outlined by the blogger on his post seem to suggest that it is better. Follow  this link to see the steps he outlined. Hopefully this helps you with your situation.\n", "Q: Running a .run file? When I ran to Nvidia's website to download their 64bit Linux drivers, it downloaded a file named \"NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-319.49.run\".  Since this wasn't a file extension I'd seen before, I assumed double clicking would do nothing (Incorrect; it actually tried opening it in a word processor which hilariously meets with a crashed word processor).\nI installed new drivers through a terminal.  For future reference, however, assuming this is an archive, and clearly Nvidia expects everyone to be able to crack it open on command, how would I go about making the .run file actually be useful?  Was there a command to decompress it and install the drivers?  Was it a script and I just have no idea how to execute it?\n(Very new to Linux; Ubuntu's my first attempt at running a distro since ...oh, RedHat 6.something.  Anyways, so much for context.)\n\nA: The way to do this is to simply make the .run file executable and run it.\n\nchmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-319.49.run  \n\nYou need to kill the x-server first. Check this question for the way to kill the x server. First go to virtual terminal tty1 by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1. Then run\n\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nLater run this\n\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-319.49.run\n\nThis will install the driver. To restart, run this command in the same F1 terminal\n\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nor just restart.\nI have tried to install NVidia drivers and they made my system crash badly. Hence, I advice you to avoid NVidia and stick to Nouveau (as mentioned in the comments) unless you want to test your patience and Ubuntu's sturdiness.\n", "Q: Journal Software That Works I am working on a book and two computer programs. The amount of time I spend dealing with how everything is organized makes the amount of time I spend writing negligible.

To demonstrate the specific ways in which it accomplishes what you seek:\nHierarchical organization - \nCreate new categories and subcategories for events.\n\nExport events to html or print to pdf -\n\nYou can be selective with the information output.\n\nRich Text Editing support -\nCheck. However, tables and images are something that is not supported.\n\nInstalling with apt -\nThis is the only downside: I am not sure how to install it.

I have Kubuntu 13.04 installed. KDE uses powerdevil to manage hibernate/sleep, which in turns seems to use pm-utils backend. pm-utils is unmaintained, and broken at this point1. For example, I had to jump through many hoops to just enable in-kernel hybrid suspend which has been present since kernel 3.6.\nI asked on Freenode #kde, and it seems like KDE powerdevil has been modified to accept newer backends for a while now. The order of preference is roughly systemd-login1, upower, and Solid. \nDoes anyone know what power backed will *buntu 13.10 use? \n\n1 The pm-utils code was last updated in 2010, and they have not been accepting patches.\n\nA: The latest version of pm-utils seems to be \"06 Nov 2013\" from this changelog.\n", "Q: How to change Nautilus to show \"file system\" instead of \"computer\"? Nautilus use to have the label for the file system in it's tree as \"File System\". Recently that was changed to now show \"Computer\" in the tree to open the file system. Regardless of why this change was made, how do I change it back? \n\n\nA: As far as I know... to change this label you should edit the nautilus Source Code.\nNOTE: In this example I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 with nautilus (Files) 3.6.3\n1) Make sure you have enable the Source code repository\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Ubuntu Software Center and in the Menu Bar choose Edit -> Software Sources. \nClick to enable \"Source code repository\".\n\n\nJust in case I use the \"Main Server\" to Download.\n\n2) Open a Terminal and install the necessary packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install build-essential\n3) Install build dependencies\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get build-dep nautilus\n4) Create a folder to download the source code.\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir ~/Downloads/src\n\n*cd ~/Downloads/src\n5) Download the source code.\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get source nautilus\n6) Edit the file \"nautilus-places-sidebar.c\" \nSearch for the line 3261 to edit.\n\nReplace \"Computer\" for \"File System\".\nTo edit:\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit nautilus-3.6.3/src/nautilus-places-sidebar.c\nBEFORE:\n\nsidebar->hostname = g_strdup (_(\"Computer\"));\n\nAFTER:\n\nsidebar->hostname = g_strdup (_(\"File System\"));\n\nIn one command would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*sed -i '3261s/Computer/File\\ System/' ~/Downloads/src/nautilus-3.6.3/src/nautilus-places-sidebar.c\n7) Go to the \"nautilus-3.6.3\" folder to build the deb packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd nautilus-3.6.3/\n\n*dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b\n8) Now you can install the deb packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ..\n\n*sudo dpkg -i *deb\n9) Finally you can logout and Login to see the changes.\nBEFORE:\n\nAFTER:\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: You'd need to get the raring nautilus source, edit /src/nautilus-places-sidebar.c & rebuild.

That way, everyone in your local network can install and upgrade from your computer without the need for a separate internet connection.

The external monitor is an AOC e950Swn and the LCD is complety unpluged from the MOBO, if that matters.\nI have and old (3 months) installation in a HDD, and the GRUB shows up, but when I select Ubuntu to boot the screen goes off saying there is no signal.\nI've tryed installing from a USB. When booting I press F2 so it takes me to the advanced menu. There I have chosen \"nomodeset\" but all I see are some error messages related to the wireless card and then the screen goes off.If booted without \"nomodeset\" I can't even see the error messages.\nAlso tried installing on another laptop and passing the HDD, but still doesn't work. If I log in recovery mode and try safe graphics mode all I get is a blinking console cursor. But if I log into a root console everything is there.\nMy assumptions is that it tries to turn on the laptop's LCD even if it isn't present, completely ignoring the external monitor.\nSo, how can I tell it (or force it) to load the external monitor from startup? or even when installing.\n\nA: If you can't access your system but GRUB is shown then press e on the Ubuntu menu entry in grub2, this will take you to edit mode and add the following option to the kernel line (add it to the end of the line which starts with \"linux\")\nvideo=LVDS-1:d\n\nThen press CTRL+x to boot with the edited kernel command line.\nIf it doesn't work try it with video=LVDS-0:d or to force output to VGA with video=VGA-1:e or video=VGA-0:e . More on these parameters here. \nAfter you succeed with the boot just edit your /etc/default/grub and add the working kernel line parameter to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= line to disable the LVDS output.After you edited the file run\nsudo update-grub\n\nTo save the kernel line for for later boots.\n\nA: when you boot up make sure the monitor is unplugged...let the booting process finish,plug in monitor it may still say \"no signal\"...at that point hold the Fn(function) and long press F8...this will manually switch from your built in display to the external\n\nA: IMPORTANT!!!\nBefore trying solutions above, firstly change displays settings to \"Single Display\" from display settings, not use \"Join Display\" or \"Mirror\" \nThis is worked for me;\n1- Select \"Single display\"\n2- Run: sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n3- Add: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"video=LVDS-1:d video=VGA-1:e\"\n4- Run: sudo update-grub\n5- And restart.

What am I missing?  Also, in the usb download, there was 12.04 i386 and 12.04 amd. What's the difference? What am I missing? Thanks. \n\nA: I see what's going on here. You are rebooting the machine, but your machine is booting back to the hard drive (with Windows 7 on it), and NOT to the USB stick.\nComputers look at a specific device to boot from, and yours is set to boot from the hard drive. You simply need to change this to boot into the USB stick (and into the live Ubuntu environment).\nTo accomplish this, you should do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out which key (delete, escape, F12, etc) loads your computer's BOOT MENU. You should tap this key repeatedly as soon as the machine boots. When the boot menu appears select the USB device.\n\n*You need to go into your machine's BIOS and change the BOOT ORDER so that the machine tries to boot to a USB device before the hard drive. Getting to the BIOS and changing the boot order will vary between each different machine, Google has pretty good search functionality, so you could try that.\n", "Q: basic security ubntu 12.04 LAMP server quesrions I have a few questions about security on my ubntu 12.04 LAMP server (newbie)\nThis is what I´ve done so far:\n\n*Install and configure Firewall - ufw\n\n*Secure shared memory - fstab \n\n*SSH - Disable root login and change port / adding ssh-key\n\n*Protect su by limiting access only to admin group\n\n*Harden network with sysctl settings \n\n*Disable Open DNS Recursion and Remove Version Info  - Bind9 DNS \n\n*Prevent IP Spoofing\n\n*Harden PHP for security \n\n*Restrict Apache Information Leakage\n\n*Install and configure Apache application firewall - ModSecurity\n\n*Protect from DDOS (Denial of Service) attacks with ModEvasive\n\n*Scan logs and ban suspicious hosts - DenyHosts and Fail2Ban\n\n*Intrusion Detection - PSAD\n\n*Check for RootKits - RKHunter and CHKRootKit\n\n*Scan open Ports - Nmap\n\n*Analyse system LOG files - LogWatch\n\n*SELinux - Apparmor\n\n*Audit your system security - Tiger\n--------------------------------\nI am also using Cloudflare which has some security features out of the box.\nBut should I install some sort of antivirus on my server?\n(I only have outgoing email, eg users register on my site and gets a email link sent)\nSo I am blocking all INCOMMING emails to the server by loopback-only.\nShould I block ping-requests to my site?\nOr is it not a problem letting people ping my site? ping mysite.com ...\nOff-topic, my server seems to do a reboot on its own every sunday morning 7am.\nI havent started this my self with cron-jobs or so, but is there a way to disable it from doing self-reboot every sunday morning?

The OS is secure enough that nothing is going to be installed unless you tell it to be installed.\nUbuntu does not reboot itself by default, so something must have changed that causes the reboot every week.

Whatever it is must have pretty high permissions to cause a reboot.\nAbout the secret key script: That should be ok as long as the job doesn't do anything that could cause damage or security issues. The odds of someone randomly hitting that URL is small, but you should still make sure that the script that gets invoked doesn't clear out your filesystem or something.\n", "Q: Can only open bukkit.sh with Java Web Start I'm trying to run bukkit.sh file with java 7 runtime.

But i think multi-threading problem is creating a problem, before complete output of ls -lh -R, the sort has started to do it's work.\n Now i'm getting wrong answer. How can I do it properly .\nI was trying to : ANSWER THIS QUESTION\n\nA: Try using find instead of ls -R, e.g. to find all the files > 100MB in the current directory and its subdirectories and then sort them by (human readable) size and list the largest 10\nfind . -size +100M -exec du -hd 1 {} \\; | sort -hr | head -10\n\nor (slightly more robust)\n while read -rd $'\\0' file; do du -h \"$file\"; done < <(find . -size +100M -print0) | sort -hr | head -10\n\n\nA: There is nothing to do with multi-threading. After ls completed its task, its all output will be send to sort, never before. \nAn explanation more elevated:\n\nA Unix pipe connects the STDOUT (standard output) file descriptor of\n  the first process to the STDIN (standard input) of the second. What\n  happens then is that when the first process writes to its STDOUT,\n  that output can be immediately read (from STDIN) by the second\n  process.\nUsing multiple pipes is no different than using a single pipe. Each\n  pipe is independent, and simply links the STDOUT and STDIN of the\n  adjacent processes.\n[...] pipes, as such, are consistent everywhere in a bash script.\n\nSource: What is a simple explanation for how pipes work in BASH?\nSo, I'm pretty sure that ls -lh -R |sort >> output.txt it's working like a charm. Also, I tested on my system in / directoryand and it has functioned properly with 1.597.396 files and directories (of course I had to wait a little).\n\nIf you wish an alphabetically order after file names only, don't use ls with -l argument. If you don't wish to see all blank lines, use sort with -u argument. So, overall, you should use:\nls -h -R |sort -u >> output.txt\n\nSee man ls and man sort for more options or for for a better understanding.\n", "Q: How to perform something like windows domain or active directory in Ubuntu Environment I am already running old windows 2008 server used for DNS Server and Domain Server.

Their goal is to replace Windows Server 2003/2008 with a free, Linux based alternative. And so far, they are one of the few that manage to pull it off, even with Windows 7 clients!\nInstallation is a breeze, you can select which features you need (router, dns, dhcp, gateway, domain controller etc.) and when you're done you can manage the whole thing through a nice web interface.\nIt's also not very hard to manage a heterogeneous network this way. Howtos on how to make Linux, Windows and Mac Clients authenticate against and store data on the server are readily available, and most of the Ubuntu Howtos work as well. It's still a normal Ubuntu underneath.\nGo check it out - it's free and open source. The Company behind it lives on support contracts.\nJust to clarify - in Zentyal you basically have LDAP, Samba and Kerberos tied together in one neat package.

A possible fix would be to open the /etc/apt/sources.list file with an editor of your choice\n.Change all (xx.)archive.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com.. In your case an example would be ://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources becomes\n://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources\n\nafter this, you can try running sudo apt-get update\nFor you to update your release,you need update-manager-core(sudo apt-get install update-manager-core) and then sudo do-release-upgrade but this will update you to the next release and has to be repeated until you reach say 12.04 LTS which has Long Term Support.   \n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 was supported for 18 months, and that means it's been unsupported for almost a year. If you have to use it, then you need to switch to old-releases archives, but please keep in mind that you will not get any security upgrades for it and there are known issues. \nThe correct way to \"cleanup this mess\" is to upgrade to a current version of Ubuntu. If you don't want to upgrade very often, the best suggestion is to get 12.04.3LTS, which will be supported until April 2017. You can upgrade LTS-releases directly from one to the next.

If not, you can copy the file to a directory, edit it at will, name the profile somehow (say \"foo\" instead of \"latin\") and simply run\nsetxkbmap -I. -layout foo\n\n(the -I. makes setxkbmap look for layout files also in the current directory).\nThe four strings assign to each key give the four characters that are produced by pressing the key, key with shift, key with altgr and key with algr+shift. The names of the entities (keysyms) that xkb can recognize can be found here.\n\nA: A GUI Alternative: indicator-chars\nInstalling this small indicator will let you easily insert characters like this without having to memorize many key combinations:\nhttps://github.com/Sadi58/indicator-chars\n\n\nA: There is a much simpler answer than all the other answers given here, the upwards arrow is directly available : AltGr+Shift+U gives ↑.\nYou can visually check all the keyboard layout in the language setting menu.\n\nA: To type up ↑,down ↓, right →, and left ← arrows, make sure activate Num Lock then Press Alt, while pressing the Alt button type 24, 25, 26, or 27 respectively and release the Alt button and the arrows will appear.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu boot from flash with the screen turned off? I have recently bought a new Acer V3-772G laptop and now I'm trying to install Ubuntu using a flash drive. This laptop has UEFI, but it can be disabled by switching to Legacy mode. I have done it to allow booting from a flash drive and when I boot it up, I can hear the Ubuntu welcome sound, but I can see nothing on the screen. It's not even purple or black, it looks like it is completely turned off.\nPossibly it has something to do with one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*the laptop has the NVIDIA Optimus system with Intel 4600 and GeForce 760M adapters\n\n*the flash drive has been created by Unetbootin instead of Ubuntu's native flash drive creation tool\n\n*perhaps the UEFI legacy mode interferes with the boot process\n\n\nI'm not sure what to do and how do I even start to diagnose what happens. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: This can have many reasons. For instance some laptops with two graphics chips switch off their monitor if both graphics chips are enabled simultaneously. If this is the case with your laptop, you should find a way to disable one of the graphics chips.\nOn some other laptops it helps to disable Kernel mode setting (mode setting is done by x.org in that case). If you are lucky, X.org detects the supported modes of the laptop screen correctly and your system simply works with KMS disabled. There is an answered question on how to disable KMS already. Also, if this works up to the point where X.org starts, maybe the supported resolutions are detected incorrectly. To fix this, you can try to boot to recovery mode and install proprietary GPU driers (those seem to detect the appropriate values more reliably) or to add modelines to xorg.conf.\nIn addition, you can try to disable the spash screen, or to display the boot process status messages (to get more information on what is going wrong). To do this, proceed just as with KMS, but remove the \"quiet\" and \"splash\" parameters.\n", "Q: What causes the error message \"System running in low graphics mode\" and how can I avoid it?

I bought this Dell ultrabook (XPS 13) with Ubuntu and I know Dell is known for messing up orders. (plus I had some problems on the Wifi, that's why I've been investigating deeper).\nThe wifi card on it is supposed to be a Killer wireless N 1202 but a a simple sudo lshw -C network gives me \n  *-network               \n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: AR9462 Wireless Network Adapter\n       vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 01\n       serial: <shows the serial number>\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list rom ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath9k driverversion=3.8.0-30-generic firmware=N/A ip=192.168.3.27 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11abgn\n       resources: irq:16 memory:d0400000-d047ffff memory:bfa00000-bfa0ffff\n\nand according to this wiki entry the killer uses the same chipset than the budget AR9462.\nSo the question, how do I reliably identify that they are giving me the correct stuff without having to crack open this tiny ultrabook?\n\nA: It determines the name from the PCI ID the device is showing, looking it up in /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids. In this case 168c:0034 (check with lspci -nnk | grep -A2 net) and that's translating out as an Atheros chipset.\nIt isn't uncommon for wireless brands to use chipsets they didn't manufacture. I have no problem believing you have the Killer Wireless-N in your laptop, it's just not what you thought it was before you bought it.\nThis should probably also serve as a lesson about being up-sold \"professional\" and \"gaming\" level tat.\n\nThe important thing here is removing the conflation between product and chipset.\nUbuntu talks to the chipset so that's really all it knows about. All we can do here is confirm that you're running a device that contains a AR9462 chip.\nAs you've already shown, the Killer Wireless N 1202 contains a AR9462. It seems logical that they are one and the same. If you want to confirm that the Killer Wireless N 1202 contains an AR9462, you'll either have to ask Killer, or rip one open. the chipset. Talk to Killer if you need a second opinion but images like this suggest that this is the case.\nIf you need to confirm that this is actually a Killer Wireless N 1202 and not just any old AR9462-bearing device, you're going to have to open it up (or trust the retailer).\n\nA: This package provides Qualcomm Killer Wireless-N1202 Driver and is supported on Alienware Notebook Alienware 14, Alienware 17 & Alienware 18 running the following Windows Operating \n", "Q: Why is my Ubuntu terminal becoming fully transparent?

If it is a live ubuntu CD you want why cant you just burn a ubuntu disc image onto a CD/DVD\nHope this helped...\n\nA: You can install the program if you're using a LIVE CD-RW/USB. Surely you won't be able to install the program in a CD / DVD disk. Speaking in a traditional sense. \nThe program could be \"installed\" for one-time use. It would be saved in memory. After you reboot, it would disappear. But when using a real live usb, for example, it would be \"installed\" in the media.\nSo basically You can Install Unetbootin and make a Live usb from live CD as long as the system is not restarted after installation.\n", "Q: mimetypes icons missing in nautilus I need help for a small issue with the Nautilus file manager.\nThe problem is that it dosen't show mimetypes icons for some file types.\nHere's a screenshot :\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/713/t1o5.png\nYou can see that all of these files (.c++, .h, .py and .class, and even a lot ofothers) have the same icon.

Or I'll need to install Ubuntu in some other drive. Please help.\n\nA: Using Wubi, you can install Ubuntu in Windows without having to repartition your computer. Note: there will be a performance impact: https://askubuntu.com/a/618/164093\nTo dual-boot, you will need to make a new parition for Ubuntu.

The most preferable place to do this is /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/ for system wide X start up scripts or ~/.xinputrc for users based ones.\nFor this you should install im-config (it should be the default in Ubuntu) and add your script in that folder or file.\n", "Q: How to use cgroup in ubuntu 13.04 I'm trying to learn how cgroup works on Ubuntu and seems that cgroup doesn't work in Ubuntu 13.04.

For Canonical/Ubuntu it is important to provide their software in as many languages as possible.\nThen, why doesn't Canonical offer an official website in different languages?\n(As far as I know the official website www.ubuntu.com is only in English).\n\nA: The official website is in English. If you want it in your own language you can go to the local group (or LoCo). Here is a list: http://www.ubuntu.com/support/community/local-language\nUbuntu website in ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Dutch: http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/\n\n*French: http://www.ubuntu-fr.org/\n\n*Japanese: http://www.ubuntulinux.jp/\nThese are also community driven so not official Canonical websites (though they are supported/acknowledged/endorsed on the official site).\n\nUbuntu official (I mean made and managed directly by Canonical) forums/websites always start with ubuntu- and ends with org except (very) few exceptions. They do not do one page by language but by country. \n\nA: This question is entirely inappropriate for this board. If you have a problem with Canonical's business decisions, you should contact them directly. Anything else would be speculation.\nMost of the software that Canonical provides is FOSS and not written by them. If it happens to be available in multiple languages, it's because a lot of people put in time, effort, and money to do so, and are offering it to the community.\n", "Q: I lose keyboard and mouse focus during installation onto VirtualBox?

In Raring, everytime I connect to the network, Cups installs all the printers in the network automatically, some more than once.\nFurthermore, I connect a USB printer to the laptop every now and then. Even though the printer is configured already, another printer is added to the list.\nI wish to disable this feature and allow only manual installation of printers. How do I go about it?\n\nA: The cups client libraries now also get a list of network printers from Avahi (which implements the protocol known variously as zeroconf or Bonjour or mdns or dns-sd). In older versions of cups, this was only done by the cups server.\nYou can see what is being broadcast on your network with a shell command like avahi-browse -a | grep Printer\nYou can disable avahi with sudo service avahi-daemon stop, but that will stop all zeroconf based setup, not just printers.\n\nA: To disable it simply open terminal Ctrl+Alt+T and type\n sudo cupsctl --no-remote-printers\n\nor to edit the\n /etc/cups/cupsd.conf\n\nand set\nBrowsing Off\n\nThis solution was found here\nSome newer Ubuntus (15.04 and up) may need this command instead:\nsudo cupsctl --no-share-printers\n\n\nA: In /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf, set directive:\nBrowseProtocols none\n\nAfterwards, run service cups-browsed restart and service cups restart.  There should be no printers visible, except those you've added yourself.\n\nA: It's quite simple to make it stop.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the unwanted printers. Then:\nsudo nano /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf\n\n\n*Change this line: BrowseRemoteProtocols dnssd cups (or whaterver is after it) to none so it reads: BrowseRemoteProtocols none .\n\n*Then save the file and reboot.\nSolved the problem for me.\n\nA: As mentioned earlier, this is now done in the client-side cups libraries (ie libcups.so, which GNOME and KDE apps link against) and not in the cupsd server. So changing the \"Browse\" settings in the cups server won't work.\n$ ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcups.so.2\n...\nlibavahi-common.so.3 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavahi-common.so.3\nlibavahi-client.so.3 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavahi-client.so.3\n...\n\nIE this behaviour (of showing remote printers in the Print dialog box) happens even if you turn off your local cups server. You can disable it by turning off the avahi service, but that will disable all zeroconf/mdns related functionality.\nHowever, there is at least a way to turn off most of avahi's functionality (including adding remote printers into the CUPS clients) while keeping the DNS functionality (eg when looking up foo.local-style host names):\nedit /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf and in the [server] section, add enable-dbus=no then restart the avahi-daemon service.\n\nA: I tried all of the above.  Modifying Cups did not work in Linux Mint 20, which is based on Ubuntu 20.4.  Apparently, Ubuntu and Mint no longer use Cups for Printer discovery, but instead now use Avahi.  I think it is a Systemd thing. Setting\nenable-dbus=no in avahi-daemon.conf somewhat worked, but caused the print menu in LibreOffice to take a long time (maybe 20-30 sec.) to show up, and thus was not a good solution.\nThe following did work, however, very well:\nsudo nano /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf\n\nIn that file:\nchange “use-ip4=yes” to “use-ip4=no”\n\nchange “use-ip6=yes” to “use-ip6=no”\n\nNow, only printers that I added manually show up in the \"Printers\" control panel (Printers-localhost), the HPLIP Toolbox and LibreOffice.\n\nA: I just discovered a, possibly optimal, solution to this mess. There is as service called \"cups-browsed\" which apparently is responsible for going out on the network and finding all the printers it can locate and install them for you (gee - thanks --NOT). Since this is an Upstart/Systemd job, you can stop the service with:\nFor Ubuntu versions 15.04+ (using systemd)\nsudo systemctl stop cups-browsed\n\nFollowed by:\nsudo systemctl disable cups-browsed\n\nYou may still start/stop the service manually if you wish with:\nsudo systemctl start cups-browsed\nsudo systemctl stop cups-browsed\n\nFor Ubuntu versions prior to 15.04 (using upstart)\nsudo service cups-browsed stop\n\nEven better, you can prevent the service from ever starting again by adding a simple text file to /etc/init that contains the single word manual. The file must be named\ncups-browsed.override\nSo, just start up gedit with \ngksudo gedit /etc/init/cups-browsed.override\n\nput manual in the first and only line and save the file.\nOn the next Reboot, the service will not be re-started. However, you need not reboot if you've already stopped the service. Once you've placed this file in /etc/init, the service can only be started manually (if and when you need/want it) using:\nsudo service cups-browsed start\n-or-\nsudo service cups-browsed stop`\n\nI have tested this over one reboot. Printing still works fine and so far I am not getting several hundred printers installed anymore after the reboot. Just the ones I installed manually show up.\n\nA: Found the solution, if you disable bonjour in HP (probably other printers too) the mystery printer detection is an issue of the past.\n\nA: Try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open http://localhost:631/admin/ → Edit Configuration File or Edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf\n\n*Change:\n# Show shared printers on the local network.\nBrowsing Off\nBrowseLocalProtocols none\n\nReference: cupsd.conf: BrowseLocalProtocols\n", "Q: Cursor is not changing when hovers on links while browsing in Kubuntu 13.04 Tested it in Chrome and Firefox - the cursor completely ignores the CSS cursor property on all sites, For example, on hovering over a link it appear as regular arrow.

With this, we can manage all DNS settings for the website (www.company.com) which is in a VPS on the Internet.\nNow we need to also have the crm application (crm.company.com) accessible from the Internet. However, CRM is on a Linux server in our LAN, different from the one using BIND 9.\nHow can I configure my BIND to manage the crm.company.com request and forward it to the correct server?\nEdit - based on addtional help from mr. douggro\nI try to explain better my IT structure concernig mr. douggro suggestion:\nPUBLIC REGISTRAR => Manage DNS entry for company.com\nINTERMEDIATE SRV => My server with BIND9, IpTbales, eth0 on WAN, eth1 on LAN(10.1.1.120)\nWEB SRV => My server with apache, mysql, php5 eth0 on LAN (10.1.1.122) where crm run\n\nA: There should be nothing you need to do with your BIND configuration. With your DNS being managed through your domain registrar, you should be able to enter a new A Record for crm.company.com that points to the public IP address of your LAN router.\ncrm.company.com IN A 12.34.56.789\nApache on your Linux server will need to be configured to handle requests for crm.company.com as a virtual host if the server is not already assigned that hostname.\nYou will need to configure your LAN router to open and forward necessary ports (like 80 and 8080 for http and https) to the internal LAN IP address of the Linux server.\nThis works fine if your LAN router is working with a static public IP address. If your router is using a dynamic public IP address, it gets more complicated and you will need to investigate using a dynamic DNS service like dyn.com to manage the DNS for your crm.company.com domain and configure your primary DNS to point to the dynamic DNS service for resolving the subdomain.\nEdit - based on addtional info from comments\nSince you have an intermediate server acting as a router and running BIND that you want to manage resolving a subdomain, and your primary DNS is being managed through your domain registrar, the resolution to your desired configuration gets a little complicated. Registrars rarely support subdomain DNS services, expecting that either you or your hosting provider handle any subdomain delegation.\nThe simplest solution I can think of for your desired configuration is to, if possible, run BIND on your VPS and have that become the authoritative host for your domain. You would then need to add an A Record in BIND on the VPS server for your intermediate server after giving it a FQDN and hostname (company.local will not work - it needs to be something like zones.company.com to be resolvable externally.) An additional PTR Record on the VPS for the crm.company.com server should also point to your intermediate server. Then BIND on the intermediate server should be set up with a Master Zone for zones.company.com and add an A Record to it pointing to the LAN IP of the crm server:  crm.company.com IN A 10.1.1.122\nYou will need to make sure that IPTABLES allows forwarding and pass-through of the ports needed for your CRM system.\n", "Q: Windows 7 partition not showing on Ubuntu 13.04 I use Ubuntu 13.04 on a dual boot with Windows 7.\nI could see the Windows partition until I did a hard reset because the computer froze.\nI read about using a manual mount, however the blkid just doesn't do anything, and never shows any output.\nSource:\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions\n\nBoth systems are bootable however and the filesystems seem to be fine.\n\nA: From the comments, here's what I suggest adding to your /etc/fstab file:\nUUID=BA361D27361CE5E3    /media/Data    ntfs    ro,auto,user,exec,umask=003     0    0\n\nThe explanation of the options are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*ro mounts it as read-only.\n\n*auto ensures that it's automatically mounted. You may wish to remove this.\n\n*user allows other users to mount the filesystem. This option automatically implies noexec, nodev, and nosuid.\n\n*exec allows you to run executables from the drive. Putting this will override the automatically implied noexec from the user option. You may wish to remove this if you don't plan on running executables (i.e. applications, and installations).\n\n*umask=003 sets the permissions to rwxrwxr--. It's just a set of relaxed permissions that allow you to basically have access to everything.\n\n\nThe last option (umask) sets the write permission, but you already have the drive mounted as ro, so you won't be able to write anything. But this makes it simpler if you ever want to mount it as read-write in the future; just do sudo mount -o remount,rw /media/Data.\nDon't forget to make sure that /media/Data is created.\nOnce you've added your fstab entry, do sudo mount -a to apply the settings.\n", "Q: How to connect to a WLAN printer? My printer (Canon PIXMA 5250) has USB & WLAN interfaces. It works well via direct USB connection from my desktop pc, and also from a Windows laptop that connects via WLAN. I would like to switch this laptop to Ubuntu but I don't see how I can make Ubuntu connect to the wireless printer?\nThis is my wife's laptop. Seeing how easilyl it works in Windows, I can't ask her to connect a wire to print from Ubuntu. FWIW, in Windows the option \"add printer\" automatically discovers the printer on the WLAN and successfully installs drivers for it. I don't know whether such user-friendly functionality exists in Ubuntu but I am hoping that is the case -- I just haven't found this anywhere?\nI've tried (a year ago) to set up Ubuntu on her laptop, and I had the printer set up using samba and/or CUPS and it was pretty difficult to set up, and the printed result was not the expected WYSIWYG.\nThis similar question has an answer indicating that the \"add printer\" dialog can \"find\" the printer, but when I try that, I get the message No printer was found at that address. Apparently I must enter a host but what could that be? \n\nSo how can I \"find\" a wireless printer?\n\nA: Forget that its wireless for the moment, to any computer its just a printer on the network as such it should have an IP address (host address), you may be able to find it by using an ipscanner or it maybe you can drive the menu on the device itself to reveal its IP address. Enter the IP address into the host field.\n", "Q: How can I install software wihout the Ubuntu Software Center? How can I install Gnome Dictionary or other software if my Ubuntu Software Center is not working?\nPlease give me explanation why my software center is not working and how to fix it.\n\nA: Try using the terminal and type sudo apt-get install gnome-dictionary.\nMost probably the software center isn't the problem but apt is. Therefore, the formerly mentioned command should fail and tell you why through an error message.\nOn a side note: people's answers tend to be much more helpful when you provide more information about your problem. In your case, \"is not working\" is way to general. Please explain further what happens. Are you seeing error messages? If so, what do they say? Can you install other software or is only installing gnome-dictionary the problem?\n", "Q: How to save applications for re-install or upgrade? I keep experimenting with my Ubuntu so I have to reinstall it sometimes.\nI just wanted to know whether I can create another partition only for my installed application(from software center) so that I can modify my system but have the application folders (I guess /var/cache/apt and /usr/bin) be safe and I can again use the applications after a reinstall or upgrade?\nNOTE: I already have a different partition for my /home folder.\n\nA: It does not work like that in Ubuntu (and in Linux in general). \nUnlike Windows, Ubuntu does not keep all the files needed for an application in a single folders. Rather it shares common files needed by the system as well as other apps. So, files are stored in folders for different types of common files/libraries. \nThe default installation of Ubuntu contains a fair share of applications, such as LibreOffice. These will get reinstalled / upgraded in the default location. \nAs a result, the additional apps (those installed afterwards) probably will get into dependency issues if you put them in a different partition, as there will be two sets of /usr/bin etc. and the files won't be in sync. So, if you use the set in the root (/) partition the system and the default applications will work but the applications in the other partition may not, and if you try to use (mount) the ones in the other partition, the system and the default applications will break as they will try to use the older libraries. \nSee Backing up third party apps before reinstalling Ubuntu for alternate means of saving application lists and re-install in one go.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How to copy PWD onto clipboard? So I think many people have gone through this issue where you SSH into a machine, cd to whatever path you need to be at, and then realize you actually want to be root and not your own user. However, when you sudo su -, you sign in as root and get taken to root's home directory.\nIs there a way to copy the PWD before I run sudo su - and then cd to it after without typing it again? Something like cd - that is available across users.\n\nA: A few things. \nFirst you should almost never sudo su. There's no reason for it, but lets pretend your in one of the very few circumstances where you want to sudo su.\nSecond, sudo su (no -) will keep you in your current directory and bring over your current shell setup (i.e. vars and such). So your real answer is to use sudo su without a -. Now lets pretend you want to use it together with - for some reason (note: the usages for this are damn rare). The result is that you will log in as root and not just run things as root.\nThird, assuming you want to get back to your directory after sudo su -ing. Your best bet is to just copy and paste, or navigate back to the directory. However, if you insist: \n\nsudo su - -c \"cd `pwd`; bash\"\n\nI would like to stress however that you are almost certainly using sudo and su incorrectly. The whole point of sudo (and not having a root account) is so that you run things as your self with elevated permissions. Your circumventing that. \nI suggest reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n\n*http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/7165/1\n\n*http://rixstep.com/2/20070320,00.shtml\n\nA: Use sudo -s, it will open a new shell as root, but stay in the same directory. Note that various other environment variables from your regular user will be taken along as well.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Steam start? When I try to start Steam nothing happens.

I am no networking expert so some user friendly or newbie answers would be great but any help would be appreciated (i will google more info when i am pointed at right direction).\nThis problem persists for me for a very long time, and i was experiencing it on my notebook and second computer too. I have no problem on a different operating system. The problem is only with Ubuntu.\nI cannot really say what is causing this but sometimes it just starts working and after few days its broken again (in the last half of the year it worked just once).\nFor example if i try to open youtube there are two possible scenarios that can occur besides that rare one which just loads the site as it should or as it is loading on different operating system. First one is that it has a very long load time and after that i get a blank page. The second more common scenario is that the page loads without css styles (just plain html code). If the page loads without css as a plain html than the video is represented by a black rectangle representing the flash plugin. Which works just fine except loading the video source.\nYoutube is not that big of the deal for me. I can live without that on my ubuntu system but this problem happens with other sites too. This website or Ubuntu forums included. There are many more bugged like this. Basically like 2/3 or at least half of pages i want to load which is really frustrating and most of the time i just quit ubuntu and boot up other operating system. From the head right now i can think of imdb.com as an diferent example of this weirdness. Right now this current site loaded fast but as a plain html without any styles.\nThe last time it worked fine if i remember correctly was when i was using ubuntu 10.10 or something like that. Right now i am at 12.10 64bit (don't really want to update it to 13.04 for now since last updating did not ended up very good and i ended up formmating the drive).\nBasically i am unable to load most of the sites i want to load or they load incorrectly,. Missing assets like stylesheets or javascript files. What i need is some help to correct this issue in some user friendly way since i dont have much experience with networking, or at least something that could guide me to the google solution.\nI was searching for a solution for a very long time during that years this was bugged for me and still i am unable to resolve this. If someone can help me or at least point me at some direction that would guide me to the solution, i would be really thankful to that person. If you need to know something specific than just ask.

I am not really sure what it does or if it is wise to  edit it but for now its at least somewhat better than before. If this can bring some light to the problem and someone can find a propper solution that i would be able to follow, it would be just great. I will wait for it for a while and also to make sure it did not stop working like it did when it worked just by itself for some time. If not than i will mark it as solved and accept the answer.\nUPDATE2:\nIts a bit buggy but looks like it works. It never worked this long before. Since i edited that file i am getting \"System program problem detected\" this error. Never seen it before and it dont say anything specific (just allows me to close it). But besides that and a fact that youtube loads without thumbnail images (404 error) i did not notice anything else. Its not ideal but i can live with that.

I've got a small issue though: something changed with the Ubuntu boot/shutdown screens. Instead of the traditional screen (with the logo, dark bg, and loading \"dots\"), what I get first is a plain blue screen, no text or anything:\n\nThat blue screen stays up for about 20s or so, and then it changes and shows this image for another 10s or so:\n (pretty sure this is the default gnome background image actually, vertical stripes with varying shades/fades of blue...)\nAnd after that, it goes black for a second and then Unity Greeter loads, and everything else is fine from there. I've already uninstalled/purged gnome-shell, and also I've ran sudo update-initramfs -u && sudo update-grub. Any ideas as to how I can get the default Ubuntu loading/shutdown screens back? Thanks!\nEdit: Using Ubuntu 13.04, and I've also tried running dconf-tools reset -f /org/compiz/, with no change.\n\nA: I have your solution! It comes in two parts.\nFirst, you most likely need to reset unity, because Gnome probably wrought havoc on your icons and overall unity theme. To do that, you'll need to run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:freyja-dev/unity-tweak-tool-daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nThen run this command to reset unity:\nunity-tweak-tool --reset-unity\n\nNow about that pesky boot animation that Gnome has changed on you. Download Plymouth Manager using the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:mefrio-g/plymouthmanager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install plymouth-manager\n\nIf for some reason you get an error message or it doesn't properly install, then download the install package from the hyperlink below and then call up the program from the unity lens.\nPlymouth Manager Download\nNow, simply select the first boot logo from the \"themes\" tab, and click \"Apply.\" A small terminal window will pop up. Enter your root password, then type \"11\" to select \"ubuntu-logo.plymouth.\"\nUpon restarting your system, your default Ubuntu boot logo should be restored, and your Unity settings should be back to normal. \nOh! When you're done, you may find that your minimize/maximize buttons are still on the right side of the window. If this is the case, open Unity Tweak Tool, click \"Window Controls\" and toggle them back and forth until they are where they belong.\nI hope you took this all as a learning experience, as I did. Have fun with Unity Tweak Tool!\n\nA: Try running unity --reset from a terminal. Keep that terminal open until you shutdown the computer. Then, it should be fine. \nEdit: Try getting into a text environment and Reinstalling Unity.\n", "Q: How to make KDE Homerun opaque?

My HDD was new, so I created the partitions as follows, in sda:\nPartition 1: Mount Point = /; Type = Primary; Size = X; Format Type = EXT4\nPartition 2: Mount Point = /home; Type = Primary; Size = X; Format Type = EXT4\nPartition 3: Mount Point = /usr; Type = Primary; Size = X; Format Type = EXT4\nPartition 4(SWAP) : Type = Primary; Size = X (MY RAM SIZE)\n\nI expected that I should see 3 different partitions (excluding SWAP) in my computer, as I see in my Windows 7.\nHowever, there is nothing like that. Whenever I enter the \"Files\" section, I only see my Home, Documents, Downloads etc. But not the other partitions I created to use.\nWould you please explain it?\nIsn't it possible to create separate partition as I am expecting?\n\nA: Linux uses a Unified file system. So in have there is only ever one file system (/). Your partitions are there as mount points. So partition 1 is mounted as / and partition 2 is mounted as /home (etc.).\nThis can be a bit confusing at first, because Windows has two drives as C: and D: but Linux will have them as their mount points.\nThere are certain strengths and weakness to this setup. The largest single strength is that you never have to worry about where something is. Configuration is in /etc it doesn't matter if /etc in on a hard drive, a usb key, a pocket calculator, or a wrist watch, it's always /etc (and don't think for a second that mounting drives is not that diverse because it is). Some would say the single biggest downside is that it's more work if your run out of space on /usr then it is if you ran out of space on C:. However apples and oranges and better partition schemes solve that problem, and to be honest I find it actually easier to deal with.\nNow as to your partitioning scheme I am going to assume you read that some where, and did some kind of recommendation. The truth is that is pretty horrid, and will likely cause issues with no benefits. \nYou probably should have done either\nPartition 1 /\npartition 2 /home\nor \nPartition 1 /\nHaving a separate /home is a bit easier on re-installs though I prefer backups. What you have done is made an artificial boundary (around /usr) that server no purpose (your not going to gain any speed or redundancy cause there on the same physical disk).\nTry reading: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy.html for more info.\n", "Q: Please settle a Sticky (bit) argument I got into a good-natured spat with a fellow worker about the nature of the sticky bit.\nMy contention, working from the chmod man page was the the sticky bit, if set, allows only the owner to delete or rename files:\nRESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT\nThe restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose \ninterpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it prevents  \nunprivileged  users from removing or renaming a file in the directory \nunless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted \ndeletion flag for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable \ndirectories like  /tmp.   For regular  files  on  some  older systems, the \nbit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more \nquickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.\n\n(see also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit)\nMy colleague is adamant that the authoritative answer is an article on a Yale forum from 1996 that instructs how the sticky bit is used to set the group inherited rights for the directory.\nAccordingly, I have installed setafcl and set acl as an option on mount (as detailed on Super User).\nWould anyone like to help settle this dispute?\n\nA: You and your colleague are talking about two different bits, so it's understandable that you don't agree on what they do.\nThe sticky bit, the setuid bit and the setgid bit are three distinct bits in a file's (or directory's) mode. See e.g. the chmod(2) man page.\nYou're both right, your reference for the sticky bit is accurate, your colleagues reference for the SGID bit is too.\n\nA: The setgid bit is what you would need. \nsudo chmod g+s /foldername\n\nDo not use the -R option for recursive unless you want to have the existing files in that directory/sub-directories to have the bit set as well. Usually you do not want the setgid bit on for files since the directory has it set.\nBelow is how to recursively set the gid bit on a folder and its sub-folders.\nsudo find /foldername -type d -exec echo chmod g+s {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to burn to multiple CDs at once (with a GUI)? I have a minor dilemma, in that I need to be able to burn multiple CDs at once, but with a GUI.\nI'm no longer using the system I was when I first wrote this question, and since then circumstances have changed somewhat. I still need an application (a modern one, preferably) that can do this job for me. It has to be able to burn to multiple drives at the same time.\nPreferably, it should also be capable of burning audio. Is there nothing for Linux that can do this that isn't ummaintained and impossible to use?\n\nA: There is a project named qmultirecord:\nhttp://linux.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/qmultirecord-101896.shtml\nwhich promises to do this on top of my burn program\ncdrskin.

Occasionally i burn with two\ndrives while having another two drives reading for\nverifying. (I have 2 PATA, 1 SATA, 3 USB.)\nA burn backend, that automatically scans for all drives\nbefore burning, would be quite hostile towards other\nusers of the system and get bad critics from multi-user\nsysadmins. Some GUI burn programs might indeed do this.\nBad would be PATA attached drives which share the same IDE\ncontroller (e.g. on older Linux: hdc and hdd). But PATA\nis becomming rare.\nAnother obstacle is the fact that burning is a synchronous\nuserspace process. We do not have the priorities which the\nkernel can use and we have to wait for each WRITE command\nto end, before we can send a new one. The kernel can queue\nmultiple such commands without waiting for the first to\nfinish. So you need some CPU reserve for good reactivity.\nFurther your hard disk will have to jump between the two\ndata sources from which the burn processes read.

I had just installed KVM and libvirt-bin. The installer automatically added my user to the libvirtd group, I had restarted the libvirt-bin service, but I was still getting the error.\nDon't change file permissions to 777. Don't just run everything as root or sudo to avoid understanding what's wrong.\nSimply logging out and back in resolved the problem by applying my new group membership.\nAssuming you just installed libvirt-bin and already confirmed that your current user is a member of the libvirtd group as the error message suggests, you will need to log out and back in for the new group membership to apply.\nI hope this helps someone.\n\nA: The problem is discussed on Launchpad and the cause of this problem can be solved by installing the xen-utils package (xen-utils-4.4 on Ubuntu 14.04). I previously was getting around this issue by virt-manager through sudo at the command line.\n\nA: This was solution for me:\nsudo apt install libvirt-daemon-system\n\nsudo systemctl start libvirtd\n\nrestart system\n\nA: Various answers allude to the fact that the problem can occur due to group permissions not getting applied to the user running Virtual Machine Manager, and, the accepted answer, noting that reboot fixed the problem, quite possibly depended on reboot to give the user the group permissions on login (though reboot could potentially start services also).\nIn the case of Ubuntu 20.04.1 installing QEMU/KVM with apt-get did automatically start all services, and ended up resolving strictly by finding out how to give the user running Virtual Machine Manager libvirt group access (even though /etc/group did show that the user was granted the rights).\nAs others mention, logout/login is usually necessary to register new group permissions, but, in the case of a GNOME graphical desktop using gdm, logout and re-login were not sufficient to grant the GUI user new libvirt group rights.  In fact, logging out AND restarting gdm, stopping all instances of the GNOME shell), and, logging back in, was not enough.\nIn one scenario, the following was effective, and did not require rebooting after installation of libvirt:\n\n*\n\n*loginctl terminate-user <user> where  is the user logging into GNOME.\n\n*sudo systemctl restart gdm\nThe loginctl command was obtained from this answer.\nThe gdm restart was required because after loginctl was run, the graphical console quit without offering a login screen (leaving only a black screen).  It was not determined whether loginctl always kills the graphical login mechanism, but if it does not, then the gdm restart may be superfluous (omitted).\nFor the record, in the case where this solution worked, libvirt/KVM was installed by installing: bridge-utils, libvirt-daemon-system, qemu-kvm, and virt-manager.  This properly started the required services without manual intervention, and automatically assigned group rights to pre-existing users with sudo rights.\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 17.10, I had to also add myself to group libvirt.  I had already added myself to libvirtd and did not remove myself from that group.  I do not know if both are required or not.\nI did this since I noticed the contents of /var/run/libvirt were owned by libvirt instead of by libvirtd.\n\nA: Easy fix: Go to accounts and change your groups to both of the libvirt groups.\n\nA: I had faced the same issue.\ntry running the virt manager with sudo\nsudo virt-manager\n\n\nA: I simply followed this tutorial. What I was missing:\nsudo systemctl enable libvirtd.service\nsudo systemctl start libvirtd.service\n\n\nA: I had this same problem and in the detailed error report it talks about lack of permission to the libvirt-sock file. Changing the permission of the file /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock to 777 made it work for me.\n\nA: use Ubuntu Software to uninstall virtual manager, log out, log back in, install virtual manager, and run it normally without using sudo or even using the command line.\n", "Q: Remove files in a directory based on partial name I wanted to know what is the best way to remove any files no matter what their extension is based on a partial name.  \nExample:\n13-05-12_foo_something.jpg\n13-06-01_something.png\n13-05-05_foo_site.html\n\nrm everything in a directory and within the sub folders with _foo_ in the name.  \n\nA: The simple way:\ncd /path/to/directory\nrm *_foo_*\n\nor \nrm /path/to/directory/*_foo_*\n\nThe asterisk (*) matches all characters.\nTo get explanations about what is being done, use rm with -v option. To be prompted before every removal, use rm with -i option:\nrm -vi *_foo_*\n\nSee man rm for more info.\n\nA: If you want to do it in all subdirectories too, the easiest way is to enable the globstar shell option:\nshopt -s globstar\nrm **/*foo_*\n\nThere should be a commented (i.e. starting with a #) line in the default ~/.bashrc (line 29 in mine): \n# shopt -s globstar extglob\n\nJust uncomment that line and you'll have access to some improved bash features.\n", "Q: How do I clear Software Center history?

Lots of people have started developing Ubuntu Touch apps for the Ubuntu App Showdown and just in general, and have published them in the Click App Store.\nWhat is the Click App Store, and how do I install apps published in it?\n\nA: What is the Click App Store?\nThe Click App Store is not an application that runs on your phone, tablet, or computer. Instead, it is the service that hosts Ubuntu Touch apps that have been packaged as Click packages.\nHow do I install or view Ubuntu Touch apps?\nDeveloper\nIf you're the developer of an app, you can view your app by going to https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/click-apps/\n\nWebsite\nCurrently, there is no equivalent to http://apps.ubuntu.com for viewing Ubuntu Touch apps. I believe this is coming soon, though!\nUbuntu Desktop\nIf you're running the regular, desktop version of Ubuntu, there is no way to view or install Ubuntu Touch apps by default. Currently, the Ubuntu Software Center does not show Ubuntu Touch apps.\nHowever, I wrote an app using the Ubuntu SDK that lets you view the available apps in the Click App Store:\n\nIt is written using the Ubuntu SDK, so that needs to be installed to run it. You can download it from https://github.com/iBeliever/click-appstore, compile and run it as any other Qt app.\nCurrently, it lets you browse the available apps and view details about them. I'm currently working on a way to install apps on the desktop.\nUbuntu Touch\nIf you're running Ubuntu Touch, you can view and install applications by searching the Applications scope in the Dash.\n\n\nA: To view Apps please have a look at the following page:\nhttps://uappexplorer.com/apps\nthere you can browse all available apps, scopes and webapps\nif you use the page from within the browser of your phone/tablet you will be redirected to the official app store after clicking on \"install\" where you can install the app\n\n", "Q: How do I get my Canon Pixma IP1500 to work with 12.04?

So I would recommend that you upgrade, even if that means leaving LTS behind. In your situation, I am guessing that LTS is less important than being able to print (and scan?) at all.\n", "Q: Does anyone know of a voicechanger that i can use with skype? Does anyone know of a live voice changer that I can connect to Skype so that I can have some fun with my friends?\n\nA: There is Clownfish for Skype. I don't know exactly how good it is, but you can give it a try.\n\nA: I am using Voice Changer Software Diamond, available at audio4fun.com\nI am using Windows and that is a good voice changer with many effects and presets. They also have an add-on store to download more presets. (I went and download some scary voices there).\n", "Q: I have just installed 13.04 and am confused buy the security pass-phrase/encryption options I included both the security options in my installation. The one was a pass-phrase I chose and the other was a pass phrase generated buy Ubuntu.\nWhat are the each for? I have never had to use the code that was generated, when would I ever need to use it? I am confused.\nI now have to enter a code when I turn on and my regular log in. Do I need them both?\nCan one be removed and if so what is the best one to deactivate? \n\nA: I assume you are referring to your user password and the hard disk encryption password.\nThe first one is required before the encrypted volume is even mounted. If you have encrypted your home (that is, the place where user files reside, your desktop and all), then you need it to access your home directory.\nThe second is your login password. In Ubuntu, this is necessary not only for logging in, but also for doing administrative tasks (like modifying or updating the system), remotely accessing your machine etc.\nIf you want to disable one of them, then I'd suggest choosing the option for automatic login. You cannot log in automatically if your home directory does not exist (almost). Go to Settings / User Accounts and set the \"Automatic Login\" option to \"ON\".\n\nYou will still need your password for accessing your machine remotely, logging in from a text console or performing administrative tasks (and this is a good thing).\nLet me now shortly explain the necessity of having both passwords in general. You see, many Ubuntu machines are servers where many users can log in. Such a machine, if it has encrypted home directories, requires one password at a start-up to mount the home of all the users; then when users log in, they need to enter their respective passwords.\nFurthermore, mounting the hard drive partitions is a process that happens usually once at boot time, and is completely independent from the process of user authentication at log in. For example, you can take out the disk with the home directories and attach it to another machine (or a miscreant might do it). Then you can only access the data on the hard disk with your encryption password.\nP.S. That said, I don't encrypt my hard disks. I only have a small encrypted directories where I store the really sensitive data.\n\nA: The generated one will be used when you need to mount to your home folder outside the Operating system or need to recover your home directory...because it has been encrypted. Suppose that your operating system became unstable or broken. How can you get in to the encrypted /home folder to recover your private files?\nOf course with the help of the pass phrase that has been generated.\n", "Q: Login prompt remains displayed after login The LOGIN Pannel freezes....Unable to change Wallpaper\n\n\nA: Choose \"Advanced\" option from the GRUB menu and try another kernel version to login...\nThe GRUB: The first screen while opening the computer. It's headline is GNU GRUB. There is an opton in that menu. You can make it visible with pressing and holding the Shift key at boot time.\n", "Q: Can I run Ubuntu Studio on a server or must I only run Ubuntu server? I would like to purchase a legacy server with 8 to 16 cores and use it as a workstation. Can I run Ubuntu Studio on a server or must I only run Ubuntu server? Will the speed of say video editing be enhanced by a system?\n\nA: A server is just a computer. As Free Software, there are no legal restrictions on where you can install a given distribution of Ubuntu. Given that the major difference between Ubuntu Server and Desktop is not the kernel but just the set of applications installed, you should have no trouble running Ubuntu on compatible server hardware.\nMultiple CPU cores will only speed up software that is optimized to utilise multiple cores, so it depends on the software you will be running, but you will be able to run multiple applications simultaneously with less slowdown at the least.\nFor video editing, a combination of fast discs and processor power is probably the desired combination - but I'm no expert on this topic.\n\nA: If you can install a graphics card (or if it has onboard graphics) you can use is as a desktop machine.\nVideo editing will probably be sped up  by a multi-core machine though video encoding (what you'll do after editing) will probably not. Encoding is still a relatively single-threaded task so faster cores, not more cores are more useful.\n", "Q: pc wont boot with sd card reader plugged in when i installed 12.04 on new hdd i didnt have the card reader plugged in before partitioning, now that my gateway zx4000 is all set up i realized the card reader hadnt been plugged in so now when i try to plug it in while my pc is on the system will power off and when i reboot it gives me some kind of error message and wont reboot until i unplug the card reader, any help is appreciated. (card reader is where you insert video/photo sd card correct?)\n\nA: It would help a lot if you could tell the exact error message you received. This issue could have multiple causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*the BIOS might be set to boot from USB before trying the hard disk, so check the BIOS settings\n\n*your /etc/fstab might list the partitions to be mounted with /dev/sdx syntax - unfortunately, those are not fixed, what is /dev/sda on one boot might be /dev/sdb on the next. Therefore Ubuntu usually uses block ids instead of absolute device paths, with \"UUID=...\" syntax. If your fstab has absolute paths, you could replace them with the block ids. To find out which block id belongs to e.g. sda1 type:\nuser@host:~$ blkid -s UUID /dev/sda1\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"0123456789ABCDEF\"\nand then replace /dev/sda1 in your fstab with UUID=0123456789ABCDEF (without quotes).\n", "Q: There is no menu.lst under /boot/grub and 12.04 server can't boot The newly re-installed 12.04.3 server has the same problem as it was before.

Please create that user before using this script.\\n\"\n    exit\nfi\n\nYou can use parentheses for grouping if you like, though it is not necessary in this case.

I do know in windows this would be a major no no.\n\nA: I've done it myself as well, it is completely possible however there could be a few settings off (i.e. Screen resolution). If the new hardware/laptop requires new third party drivers Ubuntu will automatically call that our for you or you can just manually installed them to get better performance. \n\nA: You can, I have done it myself without any issues.\nThough as the comment says, you need to remove the 3rd party drivers before moving the SSD to the other.\n\nA: Yeah, it works extremely well. One thing I came across doing this, was that my network card was not auto detected anymore.\nI found out that a custom rule targeting my specific network card had been added to /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules by the ubuntu installer to make sure eth0 would always be eth0 even if another card was added.

How can I change from the non-specific Europe shop (that has less music available) to the UK shop (that has more labels signed up)?\n\nA: The store is based on IP address of your client. If you are visiting from a UK IP address, you would see the UK store.\nThe only thing that may prevent that, is possibly if there is a session cookie or such, cached in your browser. You can log out of the Ubuntu One web site, clear the cookies and cache for the site, and then go back to https://one.ubuntu.com/music-store and log in, and it should be the UK store.\n", "Q: Disable number keys on top-row of keyboard I want to disable the number-part of the keys on the top-row of my keyboard.

Is this correct?\nI'm a novice at best when it comes to linux and especially graphics programming, so please, bear with me.\n\nA: Unfortunately, OpenGL 4.0 is not yet supported with the Intel Linux Graphics driver (as reported by your glGetString() call). There is no proprietary driver, so you are stuck with this until they release a driver with support for this.\nSupport for OpenGL 4.0 likely means it is implemented for Windows.\n", "Q: KDE Desktop themes not installing?

Since it came with Windows 8 installed it turned out to be an unexpected challenge.  For anyone with a Lenovo product you are likely to run into the same problem, essentially it refused to even see a new SSD drive I transplanted from another computer.  \nThus began my little journey.  Windows 8 machines utilize UEFI instead of BIOS and the kicker is that you can only get to it by going through Windows.  This can be done by going to the lower right hand corner and hitting Settings.  Then change settings, and then General.  Scroll down to Advanced Options go into it and choose UEFI Settings.  \nYour machine will then boot into the UEFI/BIOS.  You need to enable legacy, set legacy to first, make sure USB boot is enable, and enable BIOS flash back.

Hit the brightness control function key and it should become visible.\nNow for my two questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Brightness control has two settings really bright close to maximum and really dim close to black with nothing in between, is there a work around to allow finer adjustment?

Does anyone know how to fix this? I am quite a noob at Ubuntu and Linux so please keep it as simple as possible.\n\nA: Though I would recommend a clean install of Ubuntu along Windows (not with Wubi), I think I have found the solution to your problem.\n\nHi all,\n  I had the same problem as the original poster and [SOLVED] it in a very simple way. Here's my story:\n  I installed Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit using Wubi in Vista and a clean ISO. I got the \"Try hd(0,0): NTFS5: No wubildr\" error and after a minute or so, Grub loaded and Ubuntu booted. I wanted to find a fix for the wait.\nI discovered that my first partition [ hd(0,0) ] is a small (FAT?) partition Windows uses to store it's MBR and a few other things. My second partition [ hd(0,1) ] is my C: drive where Windows lives and where Wubi put Ubuntu.\n  So, the Windows Boot Loader was looking for \"wubildr\" on my first partition when really it was on my second partition where Wubi put it.\nTo correct this, I copied wubildr to the 1st partition. I don't know how to access the 1st partition from Windows, but it can be mounted and accessed easily in a Linux command prompt.\nNote: this solution was successful with Ubuntu installations on both the 2nd and 3rd partitions. \n\nand\n\nHere's how I did it (in WIndows 7 though).\n  I went to control panel and searched the word \"partition\". A result \"Create and format hard disk partition\" under Administrative tools will show up.\n  Click on the \"Create and format hard disk partition\". The disk management dialogue box will open.\n  Look below.\n  You will see \"System Reserved\", (C, (D and/or any other partition that you might have with their respective letters.\n  Right click on the \"System Reserved\", select \"Change Drive letters and paths\". In the new dialogue box, click \"add\" and then \"OK\" on the new dialogue box that appears. You should receive a notification similar to the one when you plug in a pendrive.\n  Now, go to the directory where you installed Ubuntu/Kubuntu, search for and copy the file wubildr and then paste it in the new partition that should have appeared in My Computer. (Do not do anything else to the new partition as it contains system files and might damage your Windows.)\n  After that, open disk management again and then remove the drive letter from \"System Reserved\". (You will get a warning about removing the drive letter bu do it, nothing will happen - at least nothing happened on my computer).\n  Then restart the computer. Ubuntu/Kubuntu should load normally without the \"ntfs no wubildr\" message.\n  P.S do it at your own risk, I am not responsible for any damage that might occur. \n\nFrom this link\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=798283&page=4&s=1a0baa2cb70576d8aa20c32f5f4b9f99\n\nA: Try waiting for 5 minutes or so, it sounds silly, but it actually worked for me. \nAfter two minutes the installation process continued.\n", "Q: My ubuntu macbook pro feels warm, can I solve this?

It's not burning, but I feel my hands siting over something that's aways warm, that's not right (I recall very old notebook models which I used that aways felt warm), on OS X, I would feel such only when doing intensive tasks. By the way, I'm not with fans running loud or something like that, just the temperature that is above, and they run loud as usual, when I start steam to play some game =)\nAny tip on how to solve this, if possible? I think I've described all the software I've installed that could help with this, but none helped much...\nUPDATE 1\nWell, my last change was to enable EFI mode. I must do some more tests, I'm running it from battery and I think it got a good enough temperature. When running plugged to the energy source I think temperature elevates.\nUPDATE 2\nI think it's better after enabling EFI mode, maybe I can't get better than this, the only thing left that comes to my mind is undervolting.\nUPDATE 3\nI'm now using ArchLinux with general power management tools like TLP, PowerTop (with services enabled) and macfanctld. It's much better than when I used Ubuntu. This is the best upgrade I've done to this machine years back. RECOMMENDED.\n\nA: It may be best to uninstall mbpfan and install macfanctld from the mactel repo. \nIn General it should use higher speeds and is therefore louder but keeps your MacBook cooler. \nYou can configure it to suit your personal taste by editing /etc/macfanctld.conf \n\nA: The most plausible is install a newest kernel. Actually, the IRC series and 3.11.1 looks better for your hardware.\n\nA: I'm running in a good enough temperature by now. By the way, EFI boot is much faster.\nI continue to use mbpfan, and fear a custom compiled update to a very recent kernel.\n\nA: I would try resetting your SMC. This can help with system performance, fans (heat), and power issues.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\n", "Q: How do I eliminate white noise in zynaddsubfx? How do you eliminate white noise in zynaddsubfx? I am using the synthesizer with a midi program and qjackctl. It works, but there is some noise in the background. Does anyone know how to fix this?  \n\nA: Ok I managed to decrease the white noise a lot. It was a latency issue again. This is what I did. In Zynaddsubfx, I went to Edit, then I enabled Padsynth and clicked Edit. Then I saw that the sample size was 128 and not 256. I changed this, and then clicked on apply. \n\nA: Along with the above answer, I also discovered that if if you disable the sustain setting a lot of the white noise will be eliminated. This is what I did. After clicking on Edit Instrumment in zynaddsubfx, you come to a window where you will see this: \n\nClick on the E. Then you will come to a window like this: \n\nMake sure that FreeMode is selected and put Sust at 0. Then close the window. This will eliminate alot of noise that you may not want. \n", "Q: Can the 'cat' command be used to concatenate or merge multiple vcf files into one? Will doing so overwrite my original files?\n\nA: If with vcf files you mean vCard files, the resulting file works with OS X's Address Book. My guess is that it should work with any application.\nIf you do it with cat *.vcf > all.vcf, you will not overwrite your original files.\n\nA: There is no sense to use cat (cat is useful for text based files) since there is VCFtools. To install it from terminal, use:\nsudo apt-get install vcftools\n\nThen you can concatenate VCF files using vcf-concat.

This usually works for me, although sometimes I have to try it two or three times before it works. This might not be the best solution, but it might work for you.\n\nA: Many partition constraint problems have been fixed in GParted since version 0.12.1 was released.  You might try using the latest version of GParted (currently 0.16.1).  One way to do this is to boot from media containing GParted Live.\nIf that does not help, then the problem might be that logical partition sda5 starts just 2 sectors after the start of extended partition sda3.  After ensuring you have a good backup of your data, you might try shrinking sda5 by 1 MB from the left edge.  When this is successful you could try resizing the extended partition sda3.\n\nA: This seems to have worked for some people\n\nSomehow \"unable to satisfy all constraints on the partition\" problem disappeared after a left 1Mb of free space before the first partition\n\nalso\n\nWhen the extended partition got a little bit of space at the start, I could grow it to the right and carry on with what I was trying to do.\n\nLinks-\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1478324&page=2\nhttp://gparted-forum.surf4.info/viewtopic.php?id=14448\nEdit-\nRead more on this topic, and it could be a partition table issue also.

I want to document any change I do to my ubuntu system. I want to do this in a way that if I had to pass this system to another administrator, it would be easy and logical for him to access this documentation and use it for any purpose. The main reason that  I want to do this is so I can look back and see exaclly what's done to solve a problem and so on. \nWhat would be the best way to do this? I am thinking placement of the documentation files and methods of creating and viewing them easily.  \nAnother reason I want to learn good documentation is that one of the LPIC-1 books says this is very importaint, but does not elaborate much on the subject.\nHope this question was'nt to distro independent or unclear. \nUpdate: (have made some ideas and more thoughts on the subject)\nI've got a Dell Inspiron 1564 with BCM4312 wireless card on which the Broadcom Sta/wl driver caused kernel panic. I do not remember everything I tried to fix it, and I do not remember how exaclly I fixed the problem. I also have problems with my new driver, and I miss not having documented this locally.\nWhat I want, is a folder which contains both documentation on what has been done, what is installed on the system and also perhaps HOWTOs for new desktop users. I want a pager, like less to display these files, and I want to use a good location to store them. (usr/share/doc?) This is in addition to commenting in config files and scripts.\nI altso want to create a function that lists all the documentation. I think I need to write a script, with options to create, print and list my doc files. Am I on the right track at all here? \nI reckon it is not actually necessary to write a script for this, but I think it might be good learning, anyways. I am thinking something simple like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*docfile list #To list all doc files and howto files.  \n\n*docfile -n  or filename.howto #Create new/edit file doc tile\n\n*docfile  #View file in pager like less\nYeah, I've got some time on my hands at the moment.. :)\nTo cut the question to the bone: I want a simple and elegant way to create and print documentation locally. Is the suggestion above (a script) a reasonable way to solve this? And where should I place these files? Is /usr/source/doc/docfiles the place to save them?\n\nA: Create a script. \nWe have a post installation script for when we need to install a new server. After the basic Ubuntu server is installed we do a semi-unattended installation of apache, mysql and some other software. Then we extract an image with our software and settings for both apache (ie. site-enabled) and mysql (ie. my.cnf).\nThe fun part of Linux is that anything is a file so this script also has lots of \"sed\" statements that alter settings files from command line. Think along the lines of performance tweaks, cron jobs in /etc/crontab, our own log files.\nComments above the commands make sure anyone should be able to understand what is happening.\nHaving these things on paper only works in theory but after a while it is useless since  people forget to update changes they made ... Having them in a script will have everyone updating this script (since it makes their work easier).\n", "Q: Very low brightness in setup My screen is in very low brightness during setup, and can barley see using a torch.

I have been using Ubuntu from 10.04 version.\nMy CPU usage even at idle is more than 30% for each core(unlike Windows 7 uses only 5%) due to which i'm getting my processor under very high temperature. Even my friends too experienced the same problem. This is not solved even now in 13.04. I'm not telling this just by installing Ubuntu in only my system, but I have tested it with single core and multi core processors  with and without graphics cards, everything type of configuration gave me the same results.\nSomeone please help me how to solve this problem, as i'm experiencing this for years.\nCurrently my system configuration is, \n\n\n*\n\n*AMD Phenom x6 1100t processor\n\n*AMD Radeon HD 6770 GDDR5 graphics\n\n*4GB ram\n\n*1TB hdd\n\n\nA: Despite you not having a program open on the desktop there are still scores of processes running on your computer. On Windows you'd use the Task Manager to see which processes are running. On Ubuntu you use the System Monitor (Applications, System Tools, System Monitor). Click on the % CPU column to order by CPU hogs first and you'll soon see which processes are at fault.\nLikely candidates:\n\n\n*\n\n*gnome-system-monitor itself because, well, you're running it and it's doing stuff.\n\n*tracker-miner-fs, which is the file indexing service. Go to Applications, System Tools, Preferences, Search and Indexing and select \"Only when computer is being used.\" There's no \"off\" switch, unfortunately, but you can achieve the same result by moving the \"Stop indexing when disk space is below\" slider to some really high value.\n\n*compiz, which is the desktop compositor. Try going to Applications, System Tools, Preferences, CompizConfig Settings Manager and turning off all of the (probably unnecessary) eye candy.\nEven with all your CPU cores pegged at 30% your CPU should not be getting overly hot. Consider clearing any dust from its heat sink and/or upgrading to a better one.\n\nA: You first should figure out what process is eating away your CPU. \n\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal with ctrl+alt+t\n\n*execute the command top\n\n*note the process using the most cpu\n\n\nIf the process isn't a system process, kill it with sudo pkill [processname] with [processname] the name of the process you want to kill. If it is a system process, don't kill it, but try to google the name of it and figure out what functionality it does in Ubuntu. Then you can proceed to turn it off (in e.g. you system settings).\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 14.04LTS on a Dell Latitude E6400 laptop.  I found that disabling the battery charger in the BIOS solves the issue of excessive CPU utilization.\nMost likely this was due to excessive current draw (and temperature) by the charger while trying to charge a defective battery.\nI tried many of the solutions related to compiz and Xorg utilization but could not solve the problem.  Keeping core temperature and speed low seems to solve the problem for me.\nSee image of CPU temperature under control . (psensor is monitoring the temperature and indicator-cpufreq-selector is selecting the lowest possible core speed of 800MHz.)  With this behavior, the system responds very well to user requests.\nBut more interesting, note the core scheduling and utilization at about the same temperature in Turbo (2.40GHz) mode.\n\nA: I came here for the same reason, and perhaps found the solution to your question by happenstance. When I launch System Monitor and am on the resources tab, I see 4/4 of my cores randomly spiking from 0 to 50 percent cpu usage. If I click on the File Systems tab for a few seconds, and click back to the Resources tab, I can see that while I was on the File Systems tab, cpu usage flatlined. It could be that the cpu usage you see is simply caused by System Monitor updating the CPU history graph, as appears to be true in my case.\nI know answering old threads is frowned upon by many people, but I don't care. I had a current question and google led me to this post, so I assume I am not the only person that will find this post again in the future, and perhaps my answer will help someone else down the road.\n", "Q: Facebook Messenger notification sound doesn't work Lately I've installed FBmessenger in Ubuntu 13.04 following these instructions\nThe App worked fine: I could receive instant messages, see when someone commented my posts and so on, except notification sounds for new messages.

But the this weird black screen flickers on for a second and now instead of my using my Ethernet, I know use my wireless adaptor which is broke and wont work with Ubuntu.\nAnyone got any idea on how to disable this device forever so I can go back to using my Ethernet :/ \n\nA: Are you still trying to connect to the wireless network in network manager and not the wired one? Try to connect to wired network in network manager. If you deleted or edited your wired configuration in wifi try setting that up again. OR you could have simply disconnected from it. Could help get to your network manager if you stated the flavor. \nIf you really do truly need to disable wireless a way to try to do that is rfkill http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/rfkill use rfkill list to find the device you want to block then rfkill block to block it if you really want to block wifi but you will still need a configured wired connection. \n", "Q: I can't install valgrind due dpkg-deb broken pipe, how to fix this? hanu@hanu-HP-Pavilion-Sleekbook-14:~/raijin/build_debug$ sudo apt-get -f install \nReading package lists...

The version of Ubuntu offered in VPS is usually old, and I need newer version of application. Thus, I should upgrade the ubuntu version.\nHowever, apt-get dist-upgrade is not 100% safe (this is probably the reason that it is always recommended to take backup before this action). In desktop, any problem in upgrade or packages can be easily noticed, but in server, it can be hidden. Not visible to the admin, but affecting the experience of end-users (e.g., website visitors).\nIs it safe to upgrade the ubuntu distribution in a VPS?\n\nA: \n(this is probably the reason that it is always recommended to take backup before this action)\n\nNo, -any- update, upgrade or any change to a system can kill it. So at -any- given point where you want to update, upgrade or make changes to a system you make a backup. Maintaining a system is about doing things with the least amount of risks. The big problem with servers is that others depend on it so messing up is more of a problem then when changing a desktop but even for a desktop the 1st comment needs to be: create a backup or prepare to have to deal with loss of data. If only that you can never predict a power outage. \n\nIs it safe to upgrade the ubuntu distribution in a VPS?\n\nDepends. In general it will be safe but your system will be different than someone elses. Maybe you have some exotic software installed that is distribution specific or does no longer have a maintainer and does not work on the new system. Unlikely but it can happen. We used to have a piece of software called doublevision (kind of like a \"screen\" alternative) that checks on the 3rd digit of the kernel if it is still valid and refuses to run. Payware so upgrading means paying a fee to have it working again  ... \nWe have 3 servers in a datacenter. 1 is the one we store backups on. 1 is the active one. The 3rd one has identical software and data (mysql replication for instance) as the 2nd one and is the one that is being updated. After the update the 3rd one will become the active one and the 2nd one is updated. As I said above: we try to do update, upgrades with zero risk. \n\nA: \nHowever, apt-get dist-upgrade is not 100% safe (this is probably the reason that it is always recommended to take backup before this action).\n\nIf you are talking about upgrading between version, I've seen that the do-release-upgrade is less error prone in this cases.\n\nIn desktop, any problem in upgrade or packages can be easily noticed, but in server, it can be hidden. Not visible to the admin, but affecting the experience of end-users (e.g., website visitors).\n\nSometimes is better to test the server in a virtualized environment, then deploy the virtualized image in the server for a \"clean upgrade\". That way you can test all you want before affecting the end users.\n\nIs it safe to upgrade the ubuntu distribution in a VPS?\n\nDefine \"safe\". Any change, small or big, in any environment has a risk. The way you deal with this \"risk\" will determinate the \"safeness\" of the operation.\n\nIs Distribution Upgrade bad for server?\n\nDepends what you like and/or seek. Is always recommended having latest versions (with backports) in server-like systems, due obvious and reused reasons. Again, upgrading always has a risk of something going wire, if you like you can create a clon image of the system, upgrade it, test it, then replace the production server with the clon image.\nThere are several ways you can do this, but is good as always have a backup plan to reduce down time.\n", "Q: Can i allocated more then 30gb to Ubuntu Wubi?

So, if you want to remove /usr/games and /usr/local/games directories, set up again the PATH like this:\nPATH=\"/home/blaine/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247/bin:/home/blaine/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247@global/bin:/home/blaine/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p247/bin:/home/blaine/.rvm/bin:/home/blaine/bin:/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\n\nA: Changes to ~/.bashrc will apply to every new shell.\nEdit ~/.bashrc and add these two lines:\nPATH=${PATH/\":/usr/games\"/\"\"}\nPATH=${PATH/\":/usr/local/games\"/\"\"}\n\nExplanation:\n${variable/find/replacement}\n\nIn an expression of this kind, the / separates the variable, the string to find, and the string to use as a replacement.

I have 200 MB assigned for the /boot partition.  Whenever I try to update the kernel, I receive an error message that basically states /boot is full.\nWhat can I do to cleanup /boot and remove/backup the older kernels?\n\nA: Removing old Kernels (to free space on /boot)\nsee: http://askubuntu.com/questions/89710/how-do-i-free-up-more-space-in-boot\nsudo apt-get purge $(dpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-\"[0-9]*\" | awk '/ii/{print $2}' | grep -ve \"$(uname -r | sed -r 's/-[a-z]+//')\")\n\nThen run \nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: There is documentation about this at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RemoveOldKernels\nIn summary: Use\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n# and/or:\nsudo purge-old-kernels\n\nThe purge-old-kernels tool can be installed via sudo apt install byobu. Here is the description from its man-page:\n\nThis program will remove old kernel and header packages from the\n  system, freeing disk space.  It will never remove the currently\n  running kernel.  By default, it will keep at least the latest 2 kernels, \n  but the user can override that value using the --keep  parameter.\n\nIf you want a copy-paste solution, ReSearchIT Eng suggested the following:\nsudo apt install -y byobu\nsudo purge-old-kernels -y --keep 1\nsudo apt-get -y autoremove --purge\n\n\nA: Command line method:\nFirst check your kernel version, so you won't delete the in-use kernel image, running:\nuname -r\n\nNow run this command for a list of installed kernels:\ndpkg --list 'linux-image*' | grep ^ii\n\nand delete the kernels you don't want/need anymore by running this:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-VERSION\n\nReplace VERSION with the version of the kernel you want to remove.\nWhen you're done removing the older kernels, you can run this to remove ever packages you won't need anymore:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAnd finally you can run this to update grub kernel list:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: NOTE: this is only if you can't use apt to clean up due to a 100% full /boot\nIf apt-get isn't functioning because your /boot is at 100%, you'll need to clean out /boot first. This likely has caught a kernel upgrade in a partial install which means apt has pretty much froze up entirely and will keep telling you to run apt-get -f install even though that command keeps failing.\nGet the list of kernel images and determine what you can do without. This command will show installed kernels except the currently running one sudo dpkg --list 'linux-image*'|awk '{ if ($1==\"ii\") print $2}'|grep -v `uname -r`. Note the two newest versions in the list. You don't need to worry about the running one as it isn't listed here. You can check that with uname -r.\nCraft a command to delete all files in /boot for kernels that don't matter to you using brace expansion to keep you sane. Remember to exclude the current and two newest kernel images.\nExample: sudo rm -rf /boot/*-3.2.0-{23,45,49,51,52,53,54,55}-*. You can also use a range with the syntax {80..84}. \nsudo apt-get -f install to clean up what's making apt grumpy about a partial install.\nIf you run into an error that includes a line like \"Internal Error: Could not find image (/boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-56-generic)\", then run the command sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.2.0-56-generic (with your appropriate version).\nFinally, sudo apt-get autoremove to clear out the old kernel image packages that have been orphaned by the manual boot clean. \nSuggestion, run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade to take care of any upgrades that may have backed up while waiting for you to discover the full /boot partition.\nSuggestion2, Review https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates and consider setting Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies to true in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades. This will be the equivalent of running autoremove after each security updates to be sure you clean out unused kernels but will also remove other things it thinks are unused saving you from this problem in the future.\n\nA: sudo apt-get autoremove\nThis removes all but last 2 kernels. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS when /boot was at 100% capacity and apt-get upgrade failed it's last kernel upgrade. The kernel autoremove is iterative, so if you've got several kernels, they'll be removed one at a time. So be patient.\n\nA: I found that it is far easier to abandon the small partition and move /boot to the root. This also prevents any out of space issues in the future.\nFirst move your data from the boot partition to root (run as sudo -s):\ncp -a /boot /boot2\numount /boot\nrmdir /boot\nmv /boot2 /boot\n\nRemove (or comment) the /boot entry in /etc/fstab:\nvim /etc/fstab\n\nUpdate grub and make sure everything is correct:\nupdate-grub\n\napt should now be able to upgrade without problems.\nThis leaves an unused 200mb partition (which you could use for something else if you find it worth the trouble).\n\nA: Why do it by hand when you can do it with a tool? You know you're going to need it again in 30 seconds, because it takes 30 seconds for them to push a new kernal update these days =P\nI recommend using this tool, bootnukem\ngit clone https://github.com/erichs/bootnukem.git\ncd bootnukem\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nThen \nsudo bootnukem --dry-run\n\nRemove --dry-run once you confirm it looks safe\n\nA: the short answer is to use my script: ubuntu-kernel-cleanup\n", "Q: How to build vim with gui option from sources? I'm having a hard time building a VIM 7.4(obtained from vim's ftp site) with gui option. It builds ok without the gui\noption. Here's how I'm doing it:\ncd ~/Downloads/vim74/src\n./configure --enable-gui\n\nThe above line does not seem to work because I get this output from the command:  \n./configure --enable-gui | grep gui\nchecking --enable-gui argument... no GUI support\n\nI uncommented line 352 of the makefile to enable  the gui(I think):  \nCONF_OPT_GUI = --enable-gui=gtk2\n\nBut when I run vim -g(after rebuilding) I get:\nE25: GUI cannot be used: Not enabled at compile time\n\nThere's a suggestion in the makefile to check the generated auto/config.h and\nauto/config.mk files  but the files are empty(less than 10 lines).\nHow do you fix this?\n\nA: To build Vim you will need first to install all the dependencies. This could be done using\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep vim-gtk # or vim-gnome, if you prefer.\n\nThis will download and install a lot of packages that should only be needed to compile Vim. If you don't want to keep them, before running that command add this to /etc/apt/apt.conf\nAPT {\n  Get {\n     Build-Dep-Automatic \"true\";\n  };\n};\n\nThis will make all the packages installed with build-dep be \"marked to be autoremoved\". So after you finished compiling Vim you can uninstall them using sudo apt-get autoremove.\nAfter this, just proceed with the usual steps:\n$ ./configure --with-gui=gtk2 # or gnome\n$ make -j 4\n$ sudo make install  \n\n\nA: If you call ./configure --enable-gui=auto, the build process will automatically build against whichever GUI libraries are available. A cursory glance suggests that gtk2 will be prioritised over gnome2.\n\nA: Just run into the same issue on Ubuntu 16.04. Turns out, it happens because packages with headers/libs for GTK2/Gnome aren't installed.

Occasionally Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit on my Panasonic CF-51 laptop will freeze up. The mouse cursor can still be moved, but I cannot access anything and no shortcut keys seem to work. Is there any way to access the terminal when this happens?\n\nA: You may be able to access the command line only interface by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1 and then typing your short username (it has no spaces, is all lowercase) and password to login. Then you have a full screen terminal that is not dependent on the GUI.\nYou may be able to restart the graphical interface by pressing Alt + Sysrq + R and then Alt + Sysrq + K. Be forewarned though that will log out any graphical sessions so you will loose any unsaved work in the GUI, etc.\n\nA: You can access the terminal with Ctrl + Alt + F1 through F12. This is called a \"tty\" terminal. \"tty\" stands for \"teletype\". The keyboard shortcut will not get you to a terminal, but to a login prompt. Once you log in with your normal user name and password (which will not appear), you will then be taken to a bash prompt.\n", "Q: Screen randomly switches to console I have the following problem with Ubuntu 13.04: GUI randomly switches to console mode.

The only thing that helps is suspending (i.e. closing the lid) and waking up.\n\nA: Try to reconfigure lightdm, it may fix your issue\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal(CTRL+ALT+T) and execute following command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\n\n*Then chose lightdm from the list.\n\n*Restart your system:\nsudo reboot now\n\nIt may fix your issue.

I am using Chromebook Acer C7. Since the BIOS is EFI, how can I install Ubuntu 13.10 from USB on that laptop? Will Unetbootin work on that? As I went to that website it tells that it can't boot from Mac OS X devices, so I suppose it will not work on chromebooks. So if not then what tool will? \nI heard that Ubuntu 13.10 will come with kernel 9.12 or something that which will support chromebook. But can I make bootable usb or will it download and install from net as 12.04 and 13.04 do directly? Can anybody help?\n\nA: Acer C7's stock firmware won't let you boot Ubuntu USB images.\nI've had some success overwriting the stock firmware with coreboot / seabios by following instructions here: http://johnlewis.ie/pre-built-coreboot-firmware-for-chromebooks/ It's a warranty voiding procedure.\nAfter that, it should boot any linux live CD, installer images from USB sticks.

I use PPAs to manage these, but I've often wondered why these packages are so out of date while others are not (PHP5, MySQL, for example).\n\nA: The Ubuntu MOTU (\"Masters of the Universe\") team does.\nThey have to balance stability and using backported patches against using a new version and risking introducing bugs (in your case to a stable LTS version). They also have to prioritize what is important and to spend time on trying to update without breaking that package.\nIt could just be a case of not being familiar enough with a piece of software to know the kirks that could break it, so they may leave it to the \"pro's\" for that piece of software to make a PPA.\nAnd, of course, I'm sure they would always love to have more help, but it may not always be feasible for everyone (depending on what they know) to jump in and fix the things that are bothering them.\n", "Q: Having trouble installing Bradcom STA driver I just installed Ubuntu and love it so much, its so fast now.

I want to install gnome-shell package without using apt by getting the dependent packages and building them myself so that I won't have to download them the next time I do a fresh install. I want a way to get the urls of the 40+ packages required by gnome-shell so that I can wget them. \n\nA: Well, that is one of the major advantages of using a package manager such as apt (or yum or pacman or ....).\nIf you do not want to use a package manager, dependency resolution is up you you, you do it manually. You can start with reading the documentation in the source code for gnome-shell.\nAnd you are not going to save time as \"I won't have to download them the next time\", in fact next time you will have to manually resolve all the dependencies and download any and all updated source code for all the depencencies.\nYou are going to, IMO, have much better luck building from source code on an alternate distro such as gentoo or perhaps arch linux. emerge will build from source and resolve dependencies.\nAlternately you can look at the LFS documentation for package management:\nhttp://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter06/pkgmgt.html\nIMO, the closest thing to what you might want in Debian/Ubuntu is get-build-deps:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/get-build-deps.1.html\nSee also: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_management_system\n", "Q: Just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Acer Aspire 5740G laptop, it constantly shuts down itself due temperature, how to diagnostique?

(The Toshiba's tablet is a Wacom with active digitizer as opposed to the Fujitsu's USB resistive touchscreen).  So, probably I'm just missing some package or other---I haven't compiled anything for years and never was particularly good at it.  Perhaps you can sort me out.\nUPDATE:  I've replaced 13.04 with 12.04 LTS, retaining my /home partition, and now the package compiles: make completes without errors.  However, make install does not.  [To be precise, I ran checkinstall (or, rather, sudo checkinstall), which calls make install, because as far as I can tell the former is a simple upgrade of the latter (at least for my purposes), providing integration with the package management system.] Initially, it failed with the following error:\nmake: execvp: /etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen: Permission denied\nmake: *** [install] Error 127\n\nAfter some research, I tried using chmod +x on the affected file:\n$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen\n\nRunning sudo checkinstall again, the permission error is seen to have been resolved; it gets much further along before failing again.  The log which it offers to print to stdout shows a dpkg error, as follows:\ndpkg: error processing /home/archelon/fujitsu-touchscreen-driver/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-112fdb75b406/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-112fdb75b406_amd64.deb (--install):\n unable to create `/sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy.dpkg-new' (while processing `/sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy'): No such file or directory\n\nAnd, indeed, while there is /sys/module/fujitsu_usb_touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy, there is no /sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy; apparently a typographical error has been introduced somewhere.  Thus I must find and fix it.  But unfortunately I have very little idea where to look other than the install; section of the makefile, and it's not in there. (I understand there is sometimes an install file instead?  But there isn't in this case.) ...Help?\n(Since this is an entirely distinct issue, I've asked a separate question: `make install` fails apparently due to typo, but not in makefile: How to find and fix?)\nUPDATE 2013-10-18\nAfter reinstalling Kubuntu 12.04 again, this time recreating the /home partition (which, again, had been generated during an install of 13.04), I can no longer reproduce the strange error immediately above. I am still curious to know how the underscores got changed to slashes, but it looks as though nobody has any idea. It is perhaps also of interest to note that while I have still not successfully run checkinstall against this package, I have done make install; it requires the executabilization of /etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen and the installation of hal, and the GUI freezes shortly after installation completes, and there is no particular new functionality afterwards that I have noticed, and the system can no longer resume from being suspended.  I have subsequently lost interest in fujitsu-usb-touchscreen since it appears the Magick Rotation package can provide everything I was looking for.  It does not, however, work 'out-of-the-box'; I have filed a bug report which also documents the inelegant workaround I discovered.\n\nA: fujitsu_usb_touchscreen.c says it's v0.3.9, despite the enclosed README file reporting \"Fujitsu usb touchscreen kernel module and utilities v0.3.5\".

Not sure what's going on there, but if in fujitsu_usb_touchscreen.c I add the following lines immediately after the includes then it compiles without error:\n#define dbg(args...) printk(args)\n#define err(args...) printk(args)\n\nAlso, the usb_u810_tablet_probe() function defines an int err which is confusing to humans vs. the err() function/macro.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: What mount point should I use?

Is there a spesific reason why there are so many broadcom problems here on Ask Ubuntu, and on any other Ubuntu forum? What's the problem with Broadcom?\n\nA: It is a non free driver and thus can not be included into a vanilla Ubuntu. Problem with it is that there is not 1 driver but a lot of the models get their own specific driver. Look at the answer here to see what this means. I'll list 3 but there are many many more in the link:\n\n\n*\n\n*firmware-b43-installer - If you have BCM4306/3, BCM4311, BCM4318, BCM4321 or BCM4322 (only 14e4:432b)\n\n*firmware-b43-lpphy-installer - If you have the BCM4312 (with Low-Power aka LP-PHY)\n\n*firmware-b43legacy-installer - If you have the BCM4301, BCM4306/2 or BCM4306\n\n\nThe average Ubuntu user will have a bit of a problem since to manually install the correct driver the user needs to know exactly what model he has and what driver to use for that model.\n\nBut is this still a problem?

I turned off my computer and turned it back on, pressed f11, and it shows me that I can boot from 4 places. One of them was the USB and one of them said something about the UEFI USB. I tried the UEFI but when I got to the screen where it said install Ubuntu, 5 seconds later, it just turned into a black screen for like 10 minutes and just stayed there. Then I tried the USB option, booting from it, it asked me if I wanted to run it or install it. I chose install but after the initializing log, it froze at another initializing log: \n\nAny help will be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: I had the same problem when trying to install Ubuntu, My problem was related to an older cd drive being misidentified by Ubuntu during install. Strangely the drive could be read by the installer program but failed to function when Ubuntu started. Your board details seem to indicate you could be a computer builder. 12.04 expects newer hardware everywhere. If you have installed any older hardware in your system, like a cd/dvd drive, try removing the power to the drive, that's all I did then the system booted fine and never had a problem after. When the drive was connected, the system would complete the install then black screen with no forward progress. The same exact behaviour was repeated when installing or trying to run from the USB.

Therefore given that you've set up nginx to re-route queries on /sickbeard, the web_root should be 'sickbeard'.\n\n*The 'proxy_pass' in nginx config is also incorrect. It should contain the URL at which you have your sickbeard running directly (which I think in your case is the URL without opt/sickbeard). I presume if you try to open your 'proxy_path' URL in a browser, you will get a HTTP 404.\n\n\nThere is a nice tutorial at nginx website (http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#proxy) so you might want to check that too.\n", "Q: What does this code do if entered in a terminal? sudo add-apt-repository ppa:langdalepl/gvfs-mtp\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen, launch Software Updater (previously known as Update Manager) and install the available updates.

Note that you need to know the IP addresses of all your VoIP servers - you can't use ip to move traffic based on port numbers.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: bash: cd: /sda5: No such file or directory I have files in sda5 drive but when i tried to navigate into it, it gives me below error:\n~$ cd /media\n/media$ cd /sda5\nbash: cd: /sda5: No such file or directory\n/media$ ls\n003C-91E4         2A88A65788A620F5_  70866F8C866F51A0_   Document   P\n2A88A65788A620F5  70866F8C866F51A0   70866F8C866F51A0__  Document_  sus hill\n\nI have a file to split (10GB in size).which is in drive Document.\n\nA: Drop the / in front of /sda5.\nThe / means the directory is searched from the root of your disc and you want /media/sda5. \nEither do ...\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /media and then cd sda5\nor\ncd /media/sda5\nHit the tab after the me and it will auto complete it for you.\n=== \nRegarding the edit.\n\n\n*\n\n*sda5 is -not- a directory but a mount point.\n\n*One of these:\n003C-91E4         2A88A65788A620F5_  70866F8C866F51A0_   Document   P\n2A88A65788A620F5  70866F8C866F51A0   70866F8C866F51A0__  Document_  sus hill\n\nis sda5. So you need to do cd /media/003C-91E4/ to access 3C-91E4. With ls you can see contents of that disc. Type mount to get a list of mount points and their name.\n\nA: /media is seperate folder where you'll find it when you cd to / (root).. and is it always a best practice to use pwd and ls command whenever you're into a directory. These will keep you updated with what dir are you in currently (using pwd) and what are the dir reside within the current dir (using ls). BTW as Rinzwind said you're trying to jump to directory starts from root. I guess you're trying to mount a HDD or any storage device.. isn't it??\n", "Q: 12.04 64-bit Desktop - Nvidia drivers fail to startx I'm getting started with Linux for the first time.

Basically, I've run apt-get update on one of them, and I don't want to have to run it again from the other computer because I have slow and limited internet. I've copied the packages in /var/cache/apt/archives from one system to another before, and it worked just fine; no download was necessary. I'd like to  not have to update the package indexes as well.\nI believe the index files are at /var/lib/apt/lists/\n\nA: Um, no, that's not really a safe thing to do. What I have done in the past is run the following on a \"master\" computer that has everything installed:\ndpkg --get-selections > installed-software\n\nThen ship the installed-software file around on a USB key or somesuch, running the following on each \"slave\" computer I want the same set of software on:\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < installed-software\nsudo dselect install\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: If you want only the installed software of the source system the best way to do this is using:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -v -E 'deinstall|hold' > installed-packages\n\nThen in the target system run:\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < installed-packages\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nThis way you get sure that the target system don't get some packages uninstalled/holded.\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu 12.04 desktop on a laptop? I have a Toshiba satellite pro Intel Core 2 Duo. Which ubuntu should I install?\n\nA: Yes, you can install it on a laptop. Ubuntu does not have a separate section for laptop, its the same Desktop version. So you can grab it here accordingly.\nYou may have trouble booting with UEFI - so see here for more details if you have trouble booting.\n\nA: Ubuntu Desktop is for laptop too, so you can install Ubuntu Desktop.\nRegarding which Ubuntu should you install, if you mean which Ubuntu derivative, this depends on your taste and your laptop hardware.\nYou can check the \"Derivates list\" with a description of each one here: http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/derivatives\nObviously you always have to take the Desktop version because, as I said before, the Desktop version is also for laptops.\n", "Q: gnome-control-panel (System Settings) window width will not resize less than 800px In my quest of customizing the Ubuntu interface, I have stumbled upon a feature which seems almost impossible to change. The gnome-control-center (System Settings) window is UNRESIZABLE. If I rigt-click on the top bar, the Resize option is grayed out and the window size is fixed. I have 6 icons per row (6 personal, 6 hardware, 6 system) but there is another empty column which just hangs in there and I would like to find a way to shrink the default width of the main window.\nAfter reading countless pages online, all answers boiled down to this solution:\n* use sudo to open /usr/share/gnome-control-center/ui/shell.ui\n* replace \"property name=\"resizable\">False<\" with \"True\"\n* add line property name=\"width_request\">500\n(the full explanation is here: How can I resize the System Settings window?)\nSave, and.. nothing! I know this works if I increase the width, so if I say 1000 instead of 500 in width_request, the panel will extend to that width. The resize option is still unavailable, so this settings only help to increase or decrease the width, but once it gets to a certain value, the window will not shrink. It has an empty space, as if there is an invisible column there which must be displayed (see picture in the bottom link).\nSo yes, I can get any width value to gnome-control-center as long as it is BIGGER THAN 800px, but no less than that. I would need it to be about 700px, which would accommodate my 6 icons (categories) per row, instead of leaving a huge empty space now, as if it would wait for a 7th column to be put in, like it was by default, before I removed some of the icons I did not need.\nIs there a way to decrease the gnome-control-center window width in Ubuntu 13.04 to something less than 800px, knowing that any higher values works, but not smaller than that?\nSee picture here:\n\nThanks!\n\nA: You can try to edit the source code of \"gnome-control-center\".\nThere is a value named \"UNITY_FIXED_WIDTH 850\" by default.\nNOTE: In this example I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 with gnome-control-center 3.6.3\n1) Make sure you have enable the Source code repository\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*In the Menu Bar choose Edit -> Software Sources. Click to enable \"Source code repository\".\nJust in case I use the \"Main Server\" to Download.\n\n\n\n2) Open a Terminal and install the necessary packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install build-essential\n3) Install build dependencies\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get build-dep gnome-control-center\n4) Create a folder to download the source code.\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir ~/Downloads/src\n\n*cd ~/Downloads/src\n5) Download the source code.\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get source gnome-control-center\n6) Edit the line 54 in the file \"gnome-control-center.c\". (My case I changed 850 to 650)\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit gnome-control-center-3.6.3/shell/gnome-control-center.c\n\nIn one line would be.\n\n\n*\n\n*sed -i '54s/850/650/' ~/Downloads/src/gnome-control-center-3.6.3/shell/gnome-control-center.c\n7) Go to the \"gnome-control-center-3.6.3\" folder to build the deb packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd gnome-control-center-3.6.3/\n\n*dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b\n8) Now you can install the deb packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ..\n\n*sudo dpkg -i *deb\n9) Finally you can logout and Login to see the changes.\nBEFORE:\n\nAFTER:\n\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: After forcefully shut down ,it was unable to start I had to forcefully shutdown my workstation due to a system hang.

I'm running an Openbox session in Lubuntu 13.04 with the same lxpanel as I do in a standard Lubuntu session because I prefer that rather than the \"right-click\" menu provided in the Openbox session.  \nI notice that lxpanel's Menu lists some applications twice in an Openbox session but just once in a Lubuntu session. Digging a little more, I get the impression it is because the \"OnlyShowIn\" and \"NotShowIn\" instructions in certain .desktop files (in /usr/share/applications) are being ignored in an Openbox session.  \nFor example, I have two \"Software & Updates\" .desktop files:  \n-rw-r--r--   1 root root   466 Jun  7 00:51 software-properties-gnome.desktop\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root   531 Jun  7 00:51 software-properties-gtk.desktop\n\nThe upper one has OnlyShowIn=GNOME;\nand the lower one has NotShowIn=GNOME; \nBoth are visible in an Openbox session but only the latter appears, and correctly so, in a Lubuntu session. Is it because an Openbox session isn't a \"desktop environment\" and is not listed in Registered OnlyShowIn Environments?\n(It's not just about GNOME. I also have two Synaptic Package Manager .desktop files; one has OnlyShowIn=KDE; it is visible in the Openbox session but is not seen in the Lubuntu session.)\n\nA: LXpanel looks at the variable \"XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP\" to display the menu entries. You can set the value of this variable to LXDE to achieve what you ask (XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=LXDE lxpanel), because if you set it to OPENBOX several menu entries do not appear.\n\nA: The following page provides a good explanation of Openbox's autostart process, which is independent of the autostart you would experience with \"registered\" desktop environments:\nhttp://urukrama.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/autostart-applications-in-openbox-3-5/\nNote that the python-xdg package, required for Openbox to process desktop entries in /etc/xdg/autostart, is not installed by default with Openbox 3.5.0.  Also, the OnlyShowIn value for Openbox is rendered in all caps.\nGood luck, and may your box always be open.\n", "Q: LibreOffice - Silent Crash on 4.1.1.2 Just installed (a few days ago) the latest update to LibreOffice, being Version: 4.1.1.2 [Build ID: 410m0(Build:2)].\nKubuntu version is Raring.\nSource was the LO ppa on launchpad.

I do no know why it acts weird only in Ubuntu. BTW, try to open up terminal by holding ALT+CTRL+T (if you're in GUI) & type top then post the output. Also have a look at this post too...\n"]
