["Q: Is it possible to write a script to change the Energy Saver settings in OS X (10.7.3)? Basically, whenever I know I'm going to be gone, or if I'm going to sleep, I change the Energy Saver settings in System Preferences in OS X (10.7.3) for Power Adapter to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer sleep: 1 min\n\n*Display sleep: 1 min\n\n\nIf I know I'm going to be around a while, I like to change the Energy Saver settings for Power Adapter to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer Sleep: 15 min\n\n*Display Sleep: 15 min\n\n\nIs it possible to script this sort of change? I do it often enough that a script would be worth it.\n\nA: Look for the section titled \"Changing Power Management Settings\" in this MacScripter guide. An AppleScript example from the guide:\n\ndo shell script \"pmset sleep 30\" with administrator privileges\n\n\n", "Q: How can I mount an encrypted disk from the command line? When I type diskutil mount disk3 in the terminal, it says Volume(s) mounted successfully. However, the disk is not mounted and I can confirm this by opening the GUI of Disk Utility.app and also the disk does not show in the Finder.\nI suspect this is because the disk is encrypted and the terminal command is not passing via \"Keychain\" to retrieve the password for the encrypted disk.\nWhat do you think? Is there a way to mount encrypted disks via the command line?\nThanks.\n\nA: You want to run diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume <UUID>, where the UUID is the Logical Volume UUID associated with your encrypted disk, /dev/disk3.  You can get the lvUUID by running diskutil cs list in the terminal and looking for the output related to /dev/disk3.  The identifier is a long string that would look something like this 'B807C2A0-577F-3DB0-9002-F82B9137696C'.\nIt will prompt you for a password at that point and if it's correct, unlock the disk.\n\nA: I can't see what I'm doing differently today, but \ndiskutil unmount disk3           \n\nand\ndiskutil mount disk3        \n\nare working fine and properly unmounting and mounting the HDD and it is viewable in the Finder. Encryption doesn't seem to have anything to do with it.\n\nA: You can use hdiutil to mount a disk image that is protected with a passphrase.\nhdiutil attach -agentpass /path/to/image.dmg\n\nThat should attempt to mount the disk image, prompting you for the passphrase. If it's encrypted with a public key, you can pass that using option -pubkey.\n\nA: Enter Recovery Mode. Open Terminal app. Launch Disk Utility app from the command line by executing:\n/Applications/Utilities/Disk\\ Utility.app/Contents/MacOS/Disk\\ Utility\nSelect the lock drive and click mount. It will prompt for a password if encrypted\nYou can then enter your root volume normally.\n", "Q: What is the Sixth Step of MacBook Repair? My Macbook has crashed once or twice daily ever since I installed Lion. I am unable to return to Snow Leopard because my Time Machine is now coupled with Lion.\nI went through the sequence:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the PRAM: Hold down Command ⌘+Option ⌥+P+R on boot. Release after hearing the computer chime twice. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379\n\n*Reset the SMC:\nShutdown. Disconnect power adapter. Remove the battery. Press and hold power for 5 seconds.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\n\n*Verify/Repair disk\nReboot into the recovery partition (press Option ⌥ while booting) and run Disk Utility. The disk had two problems, which are now fixed. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1782\n\n*Run the hardware diagnostics:\nReboot with the original OS X Disk 1 while pressing D. The hardware diagnostics (memory only, apparently) says all is well. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1509\n\n*Reinstall OS X from the recovery partition:\nHold Command ⌘+R while booting.\nSlight reduction in the rate of crash (but that's only an impression). http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\nWhat would you try next? \nEdit:\nThe machine is out of warranty and out of Apple care. \n\nA: Take it to Apple and ask them to fix it under warranty.  If you have made a clean install, and can still demonstrate the problem, you almost certainly have some sort of hardware issue.\nIf you did a reinstall, then added something that has a kext, that might be responsible, though, so in the (unlikely) event, reinstall, don't install that, and see if that fixes the problem.\n\nA: @bmike's suggestion is written as a comment, but in fact it's a good answer: do you have an external bootable drive that you can use for troubleshooting? That will at least let you determine if your internal drive is the problem.\nPrior to upgrading to Lion I had a strange, intermittent issue with my MacBook Pro logic board. It wasn't a big problem, but became even stranger and much worse after upgrading. I had it swapped out under warranty, but perhaps it's some anecdotal evidence that installing Lion may bring to light pre-existing hardware issues that weren't obvious before. RAM issues crop up frequently in the category of surprising Lion-related problems.\nBut if you are correct in thinking that you had no hardware problems before installing Lion, it's still more likely to be a software issue. In principle the next step should be reformatting the drive, and doing a true clean install of Lion -- meaning manually migrating your data, rather than using the Migration Assistant.\n\nA: It would be a good idea to check the system logs. Directions can be found in this Apple Support KB:\n\nuse the Console application, located in the Utilities folder in the\n  Applications folder.\n\nErrors that you see there can be either googled or supplied to Apple Support for further diagnosis/fixing.\n\nA: The next step to do is to wipe/reformat one's disk and do a clean install of Lion.\nThis is radical, and I was hoping there would be a more nimble set of steps. Ask me in a while if you'd like to know whether it has at least helped.\n\nA: Right up near the top of the list of the OP, I would suggest creating another account on the machine and booting into it. I have, in the past, been amazed and chagrinned at what that \"fixes.\" Disk Warrior will check files for errors--there may be other utilities that do, but I'm not aware of them. But for those hard to get at little corruptions, there's nothing--apparently!--like a fresh account. \nIt's not hard to move the contents of your various Home folders to the new account, particularly if you use BatChmod to change permissions first, on both ends, to make drag and drop proceed without asking for a lot of admin passwords. When done, use Disk Utility to Repair Permissions. \nDon't move the old Preferences Folder to the new User Library. The problem is most likely lurking in there somewhere. Just save it in, like, Shared, until you're sure you don't need any of the old Preferences.\n", "Q: How to fix very slow server performance on OS X Lion? I have a 2008 Mac Pro (MacPro3.1 -- dual 3 GHz quad-core Xeon, 6GB memory) running Lion (10.7.3) that I'm using for as a server for a business (files, print, media, etc.) as well as a development server for a pretty standard PHP stack.  From time to time, but most of the time, other machines take a VERY long time to reach the machine over the network -- ten seconds to display a trivial html page, for instance.  The problem seems to be one of reaching the machine -- if I watch the apache server logs after making a request, I'll initially see nothing happen, and then a burst of activity once (I'm guessing here) the request reaches the server and gets handled.  But there are other times when performance is fine.  \nSome details:\n\n\n*\n\n*I mostly see this with web access, but I sometimes also get long delays in opening up a Screen Sharing or ssh connection to the machine.  Thus I don't think it's an Apache problem.  Restarting Apache also doesn't have any effect.\n\n*If the problem is happening and I hit the same website from the Mac Pro, performance is OK.  This makes me look towards the network.\n\n*I have another server -- a linux box -- on the same network, and it does not have these problems.  So, unless there's something weird about the domain name, it doesn't seem like it's a problem with my internet service.\n\n*The machine is typically not under significant load -- top reports the load average as around .3, and my attempts to crank up the load (screen sharing, playing videos, etc.) don't seem to have much impact.\n\n*I've disabled IPv6 in the Network control panel.\n\n*There's nothing of obvious (to me, anyway) interest in the log files.\n\n\nI realize this isn't a lot to go by, but does anyone out there have any insights?  This is starting to be a real issue.  Thanks!\n\nA: If it is not responding to pings (meaning ping is returning \"Request timeout\"), then the problem is definitely not DNS or anything at the application level.  I see two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware failure: either a switch or network interface is failing.  Since you have another machine working (presumably) on the same switch, perhaps your ethernet port or ethernet cable have problems.  Try a different cable.  Try setting up another interface (perhaps via WiFi, or better yet via USB ethernet dongle) just so you can ping it and see if it ever goes down.\n\n*Configuration jitter: something may be causing your network settings to change unexpectedly, similar to if you changed the Network Location.  Check your system.log and console.log.  See what is happening around the times of these outages.\nI have not seen OS X suddenly change its network configuration since 10.5 Server, so hardware failure seems more likely.  But definitely look in your system.log and console.log.\n\nA: I'm betting that you're using the machine name and depending on Bonjour/mDNS for name resolution, which is almost always machines' last resort (hence the waiting for every other possible means of resolution to give up).\nIf this is the case, the fix is to use something reliable, like proper DNS, IP addresses, or even hosts files (though this should be avoided too).\n\nA: The fact that you're seeing redirects from the router suggests to me that you have some sort of routing issue. Was that happening when you ping from another computer on the same subnet?  If so, the router shouldn't be involved at all (and the redirect is basically its way of saying, \"why did you send this to me?\").  The situation I'd expect to cause this sort of thing is when the computers (and/or router) don't all agree on what the subnet mask is.  Does everything agree on what the network's address range is?\nIf that's not the case, it might help if you clarified how your network's set up, and especially how the routers between the Mac and the computer you're pinging from are set up.\n", "Q: App from Mac App Store. What if I change Macs? The Mac App Store is really convenient, but under some circumstances, I am confused on how it manages the installation. Here I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I buy an app from the Mac App Store, then delete it, can I re-install it or do I have to buy it again?\n\n*If I buy an app from the Mac App Store, can I install it on more than one Mac? If I can't, can I delete it on the Mac that I purchased the app from, and then install it on another Mac?\n\n\nA: There is no limit on installing one copy of each app on every Mac you own or control for personal use. \nYou only pay once and can re-download the app even if the developer changes prices later. \n\nA: You can re-download the app for free (using the same Apple ID that you used to originally purchase it) as long as the developer hasn't taken the app off-sale.\nAlso you can simply copy the app's package from the old mac into the new one (Time Machine migration is one easy alternative). On the app's first launch, the App Store will ask you to login with the Apple ID that was used to originally purchase the app. Just enter your Apple ID and password and then the app will run normally.\n", "Q: Can't access particular website (Macbook OSX Lion) I have one particular website (one that I'm developing) that as of today, I can't access it on my computer. I can access it on my phone, and other people on other computers can access it, but for some reason mine won't let me. It says \"Oops, Google Chrome can't load this web page\" and it gives me the option to see the cached page. Also \"Safari can't connect to the server\". \nI've rebooted (more then once), flushed the DNS as my username, and as root, by running dscacheutil -flushcache and a couple of other similar commands.\nI didn't run sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder.\nAny ideas on what is going on and what I could do to look into the problem? Again, I can access the site just fine from other computers.\n\nA: I got it figured out (with the help of someone).\nIt was Mamp Pro on my computer. I had a server set up as the same domain as the live website. Entered sudo nano state and deleted out the conflicting IP address/domain.\n", "Q: Prevent windows and Desktop icons from rearranging with multiple monitors? I connect and disconect my MacBook Pro from a number of external displays each day. Each time I connect or disconnect the size, shape, and positions of windows and Desktop icons become disorganized and they end up in different places scattered all over the place. How can I keep my windows and icons from moving when connecting and disconnecting from external displays? \nAre there settings in Lion to control this? Are there third-party apps that fix this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Disconnecting the external display should not affect the positioning of windows and icons that are not on the external display, unless you have it set as your primary display. To set the internal display as primary, go to System Preferences → Displays → Arrangement and drag the menu-bar image (the white stripe) to the internal display. This will, of course, cause the menu bar and Dock (unless your secondary display is below your primary display) to be on the internal display.\n\n*For a window that is positioned on a secondary display, if you minimize the window to the Dock or hide its application before disconnecting, and reconnect before making it visible again, then the position of that window will be preserved. I find this quite useful.\n\nA: Stay\nStay does just what you need. I just discovered this myself, and use it for a three-monitor setup where the monitors end up turning off after a while on their own (hardware limitation, ew).\n\n", "Q: Utility to move windows as a group for Mac OS X? Is there a utility for Mac OS X that will group windows (2 separate apps)? Similar to how objects are grouped in PowerPoint or other design apps. I would like both windows to move together. \n\nA: There are 5 apps on the App Store that match the search term \"arrange windows\" and I have heard good things about three of them (in reverse aplhabetical order):\n\n\n*\n\n*WindowTiler\n\n*Cinch\n\n*BetterSnapTool\nThe one I use is also on the app store, but doesn't show in that search term but it's fabulous.\n\n\n*\n\n*Divvy\n\nA: X-Assist.\nHowever it seems to be an old app.\n", "Q: HP PSC 1350 Scanner OS X Lion I just upgraded to OS X Lion.

software/driver related conflicts!\nThe best way is always to get an idea of what might causing the problem in the first place, therefore you need to gather information and closely observe your system, processes, behavior etc.. in order to pinpoint back to the problem. Secondly, try to recreate the problem, just to make sure your suspicion is correct. The last step is finding the solution to your problem.  \nThis line of information suggest, that MicrosoftKeyboard kext (kernel extension) is causing the panic!! \ncom.microsoft.driver.MicrosoftKeyboard  7.1 (addr 0x1ac2000, size 0x40960) - last unloaded 839800501350443\n\nYou can try the following:\nDownload a linux live cd and boot into it, with no external devices attached, like keyboard, mouse, hdd etc.. if you don't encounter any problems when trying to recreate your problem / or in  due time, boot back in your os x partition (with no external devices attached). - (This step only makes sense, if you have no idea of what might be the problem whatsoever!) \nKill all system processes related to \"MicrosoftKeyboard\" and relocate the com.microsoft.driver.MicrosoftKeyboard.kext which can be found here System/Library/Extensions to another dir, so it will not be loaded when you reboot your OS. \nThat is my best guess!!

Is it possible, with the service, to host my music in the cloud, delete my whole local copy that takes up a whopping 50 GB on my small hard drive, and stream to my MacBook from the iTunes servers like I can on my iPhone?\nThanks!\n\nA: I haven't tested it (Match is not available for my country) but from the details it looks like you should be able to delete the songs locally and rely on the cloud storage to stream:\n\nOnce your music is in iCloud, you can stream it to any of your devices. Just browse the complete list of all your music stored in the cloud. To listen to a song, tap the iCloud icon next to it and your song starts playing. You can store up to 25,000 songs in iCloud (more if songs are purchased from the iTunes Store), but only what you want to play is stored on your device. So you have immediate access to a huge music library without taking up storage space.\n\nHave a look at this Mac Rumors discussion, it seems that after a song is matched and you try to delete it, a copy will be kept on the HDD in order to play it faster and not redownload it.\nEdit: I assume you're aware of the perils of solely relying on cloud storage for your music library: it will only work while connected to the cloud, availability is subject to Apple's benevolence (with little warranty) and terms of use might change anytime.\n", "Q: Can't I use iTunes playlists from a shared library on another computer? I've got a media center running iTunes, and it has some smart playlists set up.\nI've also got a desktop computer running iTunes, with which I sync my iPhone.\nI want to use the music and the smart playlists from the media center, and not the few songs I've got on the desktop computer. I thought that I could set up the media center to share its library and select that in the iPhone sync settings, but I don't see it.\nI do see the media center's shared library on my desktop, and the songs play, so that bit works. I don't see the media center's smart playlists in the desktop's iTunes and also not in the desktop's sync settings.\nIs this just not possible, or what did I miss? Both computers are running Windows, but I'm hoping that iTunes would work the same way regardless.\nBonus points for getting the star-rating changes I make on the iPhone synced back to the media center...\n\nA: You can only sync local music (music that exists in the iTunes library on the computer you sync your iPhone with).\n\nA: I do something similar, but not identical.  I have a hard drive connected to my TimeCapsule, and the hard drive has my music files.  (No media center.)\nI use the iTunes on my iMac to create playlists from my music files.  I can play them on my iMac just fine.\nWhen I sync my iPhone using my iMac, I can sync the playlists created in iTunes.  iTunes will copy them to my iPhone.\nSo maybe the only thing you need to do is get iTunes on your desktop to access the files on your media center box.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Repair \"Mail App\" after downgrade to Lion? i rollbacked from Mountain Lion developer preview to Lion.\nWorks fine, but Mail App won't open and crash...\nHere crash log:\nProcess:         Mail [791]\nPath:            /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail\nIdentifier:      com.apple.mail\nVersion:         5.2 (1257)\nBuild Info:      Mail-1257000000000000~1\nCode Type:       X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:  launchd [192]\n\nDate/Time:       2012-03-02 09:58:58.830 +0100\nOS Version:      Mac OS X 10.7.3 (11D50)\nReport Version:  9\n\nInterval Since Last Report:          14098 sec\nCrashes Since Last Report:           27\nPer-App Crashes Since Last Report:   6\nAnonymous UUID:                      584CEA07-C5AB-4448-B668-6E65B541AF85\n\nCrashed Thread:  0\n\nException Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)\nException Codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000\n\nApplication Specific Information:\ndyld: launch, loading dependent libraries\n\nDyld Error Message:\n  Symbol not found: _OBJC_CLASS_$_NSObject\n  Referenced from: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/iLifeMediaBrowser.framework/Versions/A/iLifeMediaBrowser\n  Expected in: /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib\n in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/iLifeMediaBrowser.framework/Versions/A/iLifeMediaBrowser\n\nI downloaded MailUpdate10.5.6.dmg but it won't install.

All the ones I have seen are for iPhone to iPhone\n\nA: Emoji, as the iOS emoticons are called, are Unicode characters that need a certain set of glyphs to be able to be displayed—think of it as a missing font not displaying correctly. If the device doesn't have the \"font\", it can't show it.\nWhat you're asking for is impossible: you can't do that without a custom font installed on both devices, and on most smartphones that's not possible to do. \nHowever, if the person on the intended receiving end is using a Mac running OS 10.7, they will display, as Apple decided to make them available in Lion.\n\nA: You are asking this the wrong way around.  It's down to the receiving phone to be able to understand the character codes used to send such images, and that is beyond the control of any iOS app.\n\nA: Going from memory here, so may be wrong, but I believe that WhatsApp rasterises iOS emoji icons so that they can be shown on Android and Blackberry devices.\n", "Q: Youtube video won't play with Firefox but will with Safari!

I can not flag anything because this long lasting (several months) problem has been solved, and I don't know how! I didn't change anything. This must be a side effect of something I did.

Now I want to use the same iTunes (on my MacBook Pro) and same Apple ID as her, because I want to use the apps & music currently authorized for that account without having to buy them again.\nHowever, when I sync my iPhone 4, it says that it's backing up, and then that it's syncing, but it suddenly stops and nothing more happens. When I sync my wife's iPhone 3, though, it syncs correctly. I've tried everything but same thing keeps on happening.\nWhat's happening, and how do I fix it?\n\nA: It sounds like you have a couple of options to try.\nApproach one: First, backup your wife's iPhone 3 in iTunes. Then plug your iPhone 4 into iTunes and on the initial screen for your device select Restore. Select her most recent backup. This should put all her settings as well as apps on your phone. After this you can change settings to suit you best\nApproach two: Turn on iCloud on your wife's phone, and plug it in and lock it. After it is backed up. Wipe your phone (Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings Warning this will completely delete everything off of your phone!!). Then, when you boot it up, click restore from iCloud and sign in to your Apple ID there.\nIt is important to note that all her settings (including email, etc.) will be synced in either of these methods. You can obviously change that after the restore, but both methods should provide all the apps and such. I'm not familiar with how it would work having two iPhones with the same Apple ID in the long run so there may be other bumps down the road with this process.\nDepending on where songs were bought, you may, with her phone plugged in, have to select File > Transfer Purchases from \"her name's\" iPhone. It will prompt you to login with your Apple ID, and should transfer the music to the computer. From there, you should be able to just copy the music onto your phone. Otherwise select the Music tab with your iPhone 4 plugged in and select the music you would like to sync to your phone.\n", "Q: Running OSX from Bootcamp It's well known that to run Windows on a Mac you can either use a virtual machine install or reboot into a Boot Camp partition.  You can also, with suitable software like Parallels Desktop or VMWare Fusion, open your bootcamp partition whilst booted into OS X.\nIs it possible to do this the other way around?  If I boot into Windows via Bootcamp, can I start my OS X partition via virtual Machine software?  \n\nA: I am afraid not, it's not possible to virtualise Mac OS X in order to allow it to run within Windows, at least not by effectively opening up your genuine OS partition and running is as though it was a virtual machine, which can be done for a Windows Partition within OS X.\nIt is possible to run Mac OS X in a virtual machine from a Windows OS, but it is not officially supported by any of the major vendors, and requires a lot of messing around.  Even if you did this, you would not have the ability to genuinely boot straight into that instance of Mac OS X, as it would only be available as the virtual machine.\nIf you need to access both simultaeniously, you need to stick to booting to Mac OS X, and then opening the Windows partition as a VM.\n", "Q: Linear and fast mouse speed in OS X Lion. Possible? I've got a 27\" display and, at present, I need to use the whole mousepad just to get across the screen.\nHow can i make my mouse (Logitech MX 400) movement linear AND fast? How do i speed up the mouse with NO acceleration?\n\nA: Open System Preferences > Mouse to speed up or slow down the mouse. \nGo to System Preferences > Trackpad to change trackpad speed. \nI don't believe acceleration is native to OSX. I have Kensington Trackball Works installed (for my kensington trackball) which has acceleration, and your Logitech Mouse center may have the same. If Logitech Mouse center is System Preferences chances are it will be under \"Other\".\n\nA: Try MouseZoom for all the speed you want! It provides a preferences panel to increase the scaling value beyond the limit imposed by the Mouse panel.\n\nA: A recently released app called SmoothMouse will do exactly what you want, and (in my opinion) works much better than the other alternative mouse drivers.  It's free and available here: http://smoothmouse.com\nOn top of offering options for both linear and Windows-like acceleration curves, it also removes the 32ms of lag that OSX typically imposes on mouse cursors.  To me, this is just as essential as changing the acceleration.\nThis thing is really pretty close to the holy grail - great-feeling mouse movement on OSX.\n\nA: If you want to increase the speed of mouse tracking to fasted then allowed in the system preferences follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal in /Applications/Utilities\n\n*Type open ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\n\n*Increase the value of \"com.apple.mouse.scaling\"\n\n*Logout/Re-login\n\n*Repeat until you have set the speed to the desired value\n\n\nA: 1st set your system preferences > mouse settings\nthen get a precision or gaming mouse that has adjustable settings.\nI have a 24\" imac & use a razer imperator set to maximum sensitivity because I prefer the lack of acceleration with the mouse setting.\nin my experience the osx mouse settings do tend to implement acceleration in the tracking speed.\n\nA: The Speed setting in System Preferences > Mouse should do what you want, I believe.\n", "Q: iChat call forces in-call status bar in iOS simulator Is there a way I can disassociate the iOS Simulator from my iChat calls, currently I am working on my app and I am using iChat for a video call and the in-call status bar comes and I can't toggle it off. \nIt actually says that it's a FaceTime call.\nMore:\nI am developing an iPhone application and I am using he iOS Simulator application to test it.

This is stopping me working on some things in my app and I am trying to find a way to switch it off.\n\nA: I don't know about the iPhone simulator, but if this was happening on an actual iPhone, I would associate the phone with a different Apple ID.\nCan you do that in the simulator?\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to show/open the Trash? I know how to create custom shortcuts with scripting, but I want to know if there's a built-in shortcut. To clarify, this is to show the Trash, not to empty it.\nIs there a keyboard shortcut for the Trash?\n\nA: According to Apple there is no native shortcut to open Trash.\n\nA: A very poor man's solution would be to just use Shift-Cmd-G in Finder to open ~/.Trash.\n\nA: If you are using a Spotlight or a program such as Quicksilver that allows you configure keyboard shortcuts to perform actions. Here is a solution, create an AppleScript run only Application that will open the trash can for you. Its not a built in command but is should fit the bill nicely and you can do it all with built it tools.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open AppleScript Editor \n\n*Open a new script editor window if one did not already open.\n\n*Enter the follow in to the blank editor window\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    open trash    \nend tell\n\n\n*Test the script, press Run, trash should open.\n\n*Save the Script with the name \"OpenTrash\" make sure to select \"File Format:\" Application and check the \"Run Only\" option.\n\n*Open the newly saved OpenTrash Application, trash can contents should open in the Finder. \nIntroduce it to your favorite program launcher, and set up keyboard shortcuts etc. Also note that spotlight should index it as well and you can use that to open the Trash can now too.\n⌘ + space  and then search for \"Tr\"...

Under Settings > Speech > Text to Speech I also have set a \"Key\" for quick access. \nSince I also want Text to Speech to read German and OS Lion offers Voices for other languages, I would like to have a second shortcut for German. \nDoes anyone know where I can set this? Or is the only way to constantly change the System Voice before I want a German text to be read? (And then reset the voice to Alex for English texts)? And what about French text? \nWhat options exist for this general problem?\n\nA: Kind of old post and maybe you have found a solution already.\nOne way to simplify this is with Automator.\nOpen Automator, \nchoose Service,\nService receives selected text,\ndrag action \"Speak Text\" to build worklow\nselect Voice (for example: Ryan Speaking)\nSave\nRepeat with different voices.\n(The Services List can be edited/cleaned up with Service Scrubber Application and partly under System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services)\nEdit:\nNow that you have two or more Voices under the Services Menu, you can go to:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts\nand create a new Shortcut for each voice.\nSo far, it works like this on my machine (OS 10.6.8):\nDefault System Voice: Ryan (Infovox) Shortcut Selected in Speech Pref to Control+S.\nThis starts and stops English text.\nThe German voice I have assigned Control+Y (Yannick voice from Lion OS).\nControl+Y starts German voice for German selected text; which can be stopped by clicking the main start/stop shortcut twice, here Control+S+S. The reason for twice is because pressing it once starts the English voice over the German voice.\nThat's the best I could come up so far. Make sure the shortcuts don't conflict with other shortcuts. You will notice that the additional shortcut allows you to start several voice threads, talking over each other plus the default system voice, which drives up processor activity, but no problem if one remembers to stop the speaking by double-executing of the shortcut for the default voice.\nNot sure if this works system-wide, but works in my browsers, Mail, and the BookReader app I'm using.  \nEdit 2:\nI have noticed that when activating a secondary text-to-speech voice via the Automator Service the Automator Runner process drives up processor activity to above 100% with fans speeding up. Not sure if there is a solution to this.\n\nA: I wrote a tool for that, just go to:\nhttps://github.com/Fredmf/polyglott\n\nA: Say as …\nYou can use the say command with OS X's other voices to get different languages. Use the Thomas voice to get French pronunciation or Yannick for German.\nIn this example, I will use Thomas and French as this is what I know but Yannick should work as well for German text.\nTry the following command in Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app:\nsay -v Thomas  \"Bonjour. Je m'appelle Thomas.\"\n\nIf this is acceptable, you can wrap the say command up in an Automator service; which we will do next.\nAutomator Service\nTo create the Automator Service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator.app\n\n*Create a new Quick Action (previously Service)\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action\n\n*Copy and paste in the AppleScript below:\non run {input, parameters}\n    do shell script \"say -v Thomas \" & (quoted form of (input as string))\n    return input\nend run\n\n\n*Save the service as Speak in French\n\nTo use the service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select text in TextEdit or Safari\n\n*Control + Click to reveal the Context Menu\n\n*Select Services > Speak in French\nEt voilà ! Other languages and voices are available.\nThis Automator approach allows you to keep your computer default voice set to your preferred language. While allowing selected text to be read in the alternative voice.\nAvailable Voices and Languages\nYou can list the available voices and their associated languages with the command:\nsay -v ?\n\nThe available voices can change between versions of macOS.

I already have them not syncing onto the iphone. Can I delete them from the Macbook Air?\n\nA: Yes - delete any iOS apps from iTunes and as long as you are not syncing apps to that computer, they won't transfer back. \nYour data will still be backed up, but not the apps themselves. \n\nA: You can delete them as long as you're not syncing to the iPhone.

I would like to install Filemerge, but can't find where to go to download it. Where can I download it?\n\nA: FileMerge is part of Xcode 4.x by Apple which you can download from the Mac App Store.\nThe following is taken from the description:\n\nXcode is now distributed as an application, rather than as an installer. This change enables Xcode to be updated directly from the Mac App Store.\n\n*\n\n*Includes SDKs for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and iOS 5\n\n*New code signing workflow supports signing OS X apps with Developer ID\n\n*Adds installation of command-line tools to the Downloads preference pane\n\n*Open Developer Tool menu launches Instruments, FileMerge, and other tools\n\n*ARC migration tool converts both retain/release and garbage collected code\n\n*Additional bug fixes and stability improvements\n\n\nBut FileMerge.app is now embedded inside the Xcode.app package and is not easily accessible as a standalone tool... Unless you do this:\n\n*\n\n*Browse to /Applications/Xcode.app\n\n*Right-click -> Show package contents\n\n*Contents -> Applications\n\n*Right-click FileMerge.app -> Make Alias -> Enter password\n\n*Copy the Alias to somewhere, like /Applications\n\n*Delete the original Alias\n\nNow you can use as a standalone tool, as before!\n\nA: I made a one-liner to install FileMerge and the other developer tools from Xcode 3.2.6 without installing Xcode itself. Tested on 10.12 and FileMerge still works (although some of the other apps don't). It is easily uninstallable too, just delete /Developer or ~/Developer.\nThe total install size is 0.3GB, rather than 10GB+ of Xcode.\nhttps://github.com/szhu/install-standalone-xcode-tools\n\nA: Alternatively, if you don't need the entire Xcode distribution, DiffMerge is also very similar and free.\n\n\nA: Install XCode and start FileMerge by using the command line tool opendiff.\nExample:\nopendiff file1.txt file2.txt\n\nSee also the man page for opendiff.\n", "Q: How can I successively trigger an AppleScript very quickly? Background\nFor fine volume adjustment I use the following AppleScript:\ntry\n    do shell script \"killall afplay\"\nend try\nset currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings)\nset volume output volume (currentVolume + 2)\n    -- play volume changing sound at new volume\ndo shell script \"afplay /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/volume.aiff\"\n\nThis will increase the volume by 2% and play the new volume once like usual.\nProblem\nUsing this script has disadvantages:\n\n*\n\n*When I trigger the script quickly multiple times in a row, it does not respond as quickly as the 'normal' volume change would.\n\n*For every execution the volume sound is played at full length.\n\nIt appears that my problem is due to a limitation of the how the scripts are triggered. E.g. When I use FastScript, it will not execute the script again before it has been finished. The same goes for Quicksilver.\nHowever, when I assign the \"lower volume script\" to Quicksilver and the \"louder volume script\" to FastScripts I can trigger both scripts very fast after each other - so: the script is fine. I believe that my problem is due to how the scripts are triggered.\nQuestion\nHow can I successively trigger a script very fast?\n\nA: Adding > /dev/null 2>&1 & to the end of the do shell script command should work. This redirects the stdout and stderr of the do shell script command to /dev/null and runs the shell script in the background, meaning that AppleScript no longer needs to wait for the command to return stdout or stderr before the AppleScript script can finish. That means that it finishes and can be run again much more quickly.\nYou also shouldn't need the try handler at the beginning. The following modified script should work:\nset currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings)\nset volume output volume (currentVolume + 2)\n-- play volume changing sound at new volume\ndo shell script \"afplay /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/volume.aiff > /dev/null 2>&1 &\" \n\nI got this tip from MacScripter (an excellent resource for AppleScripting) in a post about running multiple instances of a shell script. \n\nA: How about adding an ampersand to the end of the afplay line so the scripted part plays in background? Like this\nafplay /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/volume.aiff &\n\n", "Q: Preventing Resume after Hang/Crash OS X 10.7.3 Since recently upgrading to \"Lion 10.7.3\", I have had repeated instances of the machine hanging/crashing without warning and then silently restarting.\nWhile this is annoying enough, the point of this question is to address what happens next: After the automatic restart, Lion reopens most/all of the applications that were running before the crash. \nThis is a problem because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It takes a long time, and\n\n*I think the original crash maybe related to memory use and restarting a large set of application means the computer is that much closer to hanging again. \n\n\nSo, how can I prevent resuming all/most applications when OSX restarts silently after a crash?\nUnlike other posts, I would like to keep resume working for normal shutdowns/logoffs, and just prevent resume after hangs/crashes.\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Restart automatically if the computer freezes\" System options (both power and battery) are NOT checked. (Why the system is restarting at all, is the topic of another question)\n\n*I say \"most\" applications b/c X11, Zotero standalone (and others?) do not resume after a crash. Pretty much everything else does (ex: Word, Excel, Matlab, iTunes, Stickies, Chrome, LyX, etc.)\n\n\nA: As described in Why does my computer auto-restart after freezing (Lion 10.7.3), even when disabled? the issue is that the computer was not actually crashing. Only the login process was crashing.

How can I script installing or upgrading apps from the Mac App Store? I'd prefer command line tools, but AppleScript or some other API would suffice.\nRelevant puzzle pieces:\n\n\n*\n\n*installer: note especially the -store flag which is used to simulate App Store installs for package devs.\n\n*systemupdate: capable of handling updates to Apple apps, flags -i installs and -a tells it to install all available updates\n\n\nA: This is possible using the open source mas command line utility: \n\nmas-cli\nA simple command line interface for the Mac App Store. Designed for scripting and automation.\n\nDisclosure: I am the creator of mas\n\nA: You may want to check out sprout-wrap and soloist.  You can install OSX packages from a uri using the dmg_package provider.  Check out some of the recipes in sprout for some examples.\nTo auto-update security updates, use the pivotal_workstation::osx_updates recipe. (Note that this uses softwareupdate)\nFor Homebrew apps, the brew provider has an upgrade action.\nAs far as I know, there's no provider to auto-update App Store apps.  However, you may be able to use the built-in auto-update feature of some apps within an execute or bash provider block.  You may also be able to use AppleScript within a chef recipe to automate the App Store app. For some examples of using inline AppleScript, take a look at the sprout-osx-settings::function_keys recipe.  (Some other examples: sprout-osx-settings::remove_expose_keyboard_shortcuts, sprout-osx-settings::set_finder_show_user_home_in_sidebar)\n\nA: Most people can just turn on automatic updates and let Apple manage all updates. If there’s a reason why you can’t or won’t do that, a command line tool does exist to automate App Store installs and updates. \nOne notable open source tool to replicate the Mac App Store from the command-line is mas:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/argon/mas\nTo install:\nbrew install mas \n\nOnce it's in, you could update all the apps that are available with:\nmas upgrade\n\n\nIf you don't want to trust third party software with your Apple ID, you could also automate your UI and can store the account name and password using keychain.\nThe Apple solution for non-App Store security patches and updates is to run the softwareupdate tool from the command line to update all software that Apple intends to be installed without user intervention or going through the App Store UI.\nCurrently on Lion and Mountain Lion - this means that the Mac will hit a local OS X server that is caching downloads for system updates and software installed outside the App store. If you don't have a local software update server, it will of course download files directly from Apple.\nFor Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and lower, - everything still comes through the App Store - so the Apple software like OS X updates is fully scriptable using this tool for updates and non-App Store updates only.\nWhat isn't scriptable (yet or perhaps ever) are apps that are installed from the App Store like Xcode and Pages and third party applications. This means that you cannot just have one tool to update all the software without opening the App Store app and entering a password at the user interface screen.\nWhat you can do is download the apps once and then copy the app to multiple macs as long as the Apple ID used to download the first copy of the app is also used on all of the Macs that will run the app.\nI know of several institutions that buy one copy of each app for a lab of 20 computers to get a license for each seat, but then deploy one file to all the Macs so that once one update download is accomplished, a tool like Apple Remote Desktop or Caspar or a home made tool like scp or rsync is used to move the updated version of the app to all Macs in the lab.\nIf you go the route of individual Apple ID for each machine, you will not be able to script the installation of App updates since each will request the password for each account unless you are comfortable knowing all of the passwords and performing UI scripting where AppleScript can enter the correct username and password programatically and then click the button to begin the download process for each machine's updates. The way that app store apps are code signed makes it hard to just slide in an update without invalidating the package or somehow reverse engineering / jailbreaking the whole app store process and sidestepping the normal flow of letting the app installer do it's work.\n\nA: I'm not sure about an AppleScript type solution, but there are tools for managing large numbers of OS X systems.\nThe one I'm most familiar with is radmind (which started out at UMich for managing their labs (old site)).\nradmind is really geared toward deploying a standard OS template to a bunch of machines and keeping it up to date, so for a small site it may be a bit too much work.  The basic workflow is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a clean \"build machine\" and install radmind & all your standard software.\n\n*Create radmind transcripts for that build machine.\n\n*Install radmind on your client machines and pull/apply the transcripts to install them.\n\n*For updates, update the build server and make an update/patch transcript, then apply it to the clients.\n\n\n…So in the strictest sense it's not automating the install, but you only have to do the interactive bit once and then distribute the updated OS to your clients.\nObviously this works best if you can install a standard set of software everywhere - If your clients are all special and unique this might not be a great solution.\n", "Q: Save and restore data with command line I will zip a file with a password. Then, I will write a script and ask:\nif (have the password saved) {\n   unzip file\n} else {\n    ask password\n    save password\n    unzip file\n}\n\nI want the user write only one time password in that computer. So what is the best program to save and restore a data. Use a file is too obvious, it will be a little more secure. \n\nA: My AppleScript-fu isn't up to the task of providing you with the necessary code, but I think you're most likely to find the solution by leveraging the Keychain.\n\nA: If I understand the question correctly, you want to have the user enter a password once, and store the input in a variable that can be reused later on in your script. You can do that like this:\n# Let the user enter a password and store it in a variable called `$passw`\nread -p \"Password: \" passw\n# After that, you can use the variable `$passw`\necho \"$passw\"\n# Delete the password variable at the end\nunset passw\n\nIf you don’t want to echo the password as the user types it, you can use:\n# Let the user enter a password and store it in a variable called `$passw`\necho \"Password:\"\nstty -echo\nread passw\nstty echo\n# After that, you can use the variable `$passw`\necho \"$passw\"\n# Delete the password variable at the end\nunset passw\n\n", "Q: Can I use two 27\" Cinema Displays from a 15\" MacBook Pro?

Also, this will just reduce the number of cores, not alter the performance of the CPU.\nIs there an easier and possibly more reliable way to do this? Please note that I'm a bit thick when it comes to hardware.\n\nA: Pulling the RAM seems a reliable way to constrain that resource.\nRunning in virtualization should help if you can tell your preferred stack to allocate less threads or cores, but I would question your main assumption that these are the critical bottlenecks for making your simulations valuable.\nWhy not let the simulations run full speed and just measure where the bottlenecks on the Mac arise. You can measure VM paging, IO statistics and time to run each job on your mac and then run a similar test on the production hardware.\nIf the code is 2 to 1 faster on the Mac and you don't have paging or IO contention, that should scale quite well to the measurements on the Linux hardware.

This isn't available on earlier versions.\n\n\nA: When you iPhone is plugged into iTunes you will see a \"Podcast\" tab across the top. You can select it and uncheck-mark the box to sync Podcasts. \nYou should also be able to go into Music on your iPhone, open up Podcasts, and slide your finger across the Podcast (from left to right, or right to left). This should pull up a delete button.\n", "Q: Does loading a bootcamp partition in VMWare fusion affect Time Machine? Recently I upgraded the RAM on my MacBook Pro and did a fresh install of Windows 7 using BootCamp. I partitioned 200MB out of my 500MB drive to be for Windows 7. I then had VMWare Fusion setup the partition to be used from within it.\nSince I've done this, I've noticed that Time Machine is running a lot more frequently. When I click in the taskbar to view it's status, it often says it is backing up approximately 5GB of information at a time, or processing about 2000 files at a time.\nSometimes I let the process finish, sometimes I tell it to stop because it starts to slow down the machine a little (since I'm doing heavy development work both on the Virtual and the Physical machine).\nThis leads me to believe that Time Machine is backing up my Virtual Machine in addition to my Physical Machine. Is this correct? Is there a way to prevent it? I plan on using Windows 7's own backup tool for the virtual machine.\n\nA: After a little more digging, I found a KB article on the VMWare site that indicates that BootCamp partitions sometimes are added to the backup scheme in Time Machine.\nThis article indicates how to exclude the Virtual Machines from the backup, which is recommended by VMWare since they have their own best practice document for backing up virtual machines.\nAfter updating the settings, the next time Time Machine ran it ignored my BootCamp partition entirely, avoiding the 4.3 GB backup every single hour. Sanity restored!\n", "Q: Use my 27\" Thunderbolt monitor with a Macbook that has only DisplayPort output Somehow this doesn't work out of the box – is there an adapter I can buy that will allow me to connect the Displayport output of my Macbook to the Thunderbolt input of my 27\" Thunderbolt monitor?\n\nA: As @bmike, @djacobson, and @jaberg have stated in comments, that will not work. There is currently (as of March 2012) no adapter, nor do I expect there to be one to adapt mini-DisplayPort to Thunderbolt. (The standards were defined to be backward-compatible, not forward-compatible.)\n\nA: No this will not work. Check the system requirements for the Apple Thunderbolt display.\n\nSystem Requirements\nThunderbolt-enabled Mac computer, including MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac\nOS X v10.6.8 or later\n\nAs of yet there is no way to add a Thunderbolt port to a Mac that did not ship with Thunderbolt.\n", "Q: Can app creators continue to access my data after I delete their app? I know that once I have subscribed to a given app, that I have granted permissions to the author to access various bits of information.  but,my question is -  what happens when I delete the app from my phone and library?\nIs the author of the app simultaneously and unilaterally denied the future ability to gather anything more from my phone?  Is it possible that while the app is deleted,  the app developer is allowed to maintain a mechanism which continues to gather information (and presumably which I was told about in the original T's and C's which I agreed to) ?\n\nA: If the app is deleted, so are all connections to said developer. It wouldn't get through the approval process if it was allowed to continue farming your data, plus it'd need to stay on your phone for this to work. \n\nA: Each app runs in a \"sandbox\" which isolates it from the rest of the phone / other apps on the phone. Access to the OS is limited by the functions a developer is provided to use. When an app is deleted it's entire sandbox is removed so nothing is left of that application. If however you gave data to the app and the app sent that information to the developer over the internet and/or you gave the app permission to use your facebook data offline for example, the developer could continue to access your facebook data from facebook until you deauthroised that app on the facebook platform for example.\n\nA: After uninstalling an app I can see that it continues to access the Internet.\nBefore I uninstall each app now I block its access to the Internet. Later I check my log file and can see each attempt at Internet access. l also have a counter on each app. Many apps show from 6 to 500 attempts per week and some far more. I have even tried good uninstall software. I have also tried to reinstall and uninstall but without result.\n", "Q: Can I silence alarms from shared calendar (on a calendar-by-calendar basis)? I use iCloud to share a family calendar with my wife (she owns the calendar, I am the sharee).  She likes to make sure she gets plenty of alarms for events on the family calendar so she doesn't miss picking up the kids or something like that.  Since I'm sharing, I also get the alarms, which aren't all that helpful when I'm in a meeting at work.\nIs there a way to silence all the alarms from a particular calendar?  I still want to get alarms from my calendars.  I also can't remove the alarms from the shared calendar, or else she won't get them (and thus our kids will be stuck somewhere).\nWe use BusyCal, if it matters.\n\nA: This answer's for iCal, since I don't have BusyCal, but I would assume that it has similar functionality.  Hopefully, it can help you to find the right control, even if it's not exactly right.\nIn iCal, you can right-click on a shared calendar in the calendar list and Get Info on it.  In the dialog that pops up (see picture), there's a checkbox to ignore alarms.\n\nI can only assume there's something similar for BusyCal.\n", "Q: How to make ntfs-3g drive visible in Finder I was using Tuxera NTFS for a while on my external drives but then my trial ran out.\nSo then I installed ntfs-3g from macports.\nWhen I connect my external drive, OSX automatically mounts it, but it is read-only.\nBut if I unmount the drive, and use ntfs-3g to mount the drive in a terminal, then I can get normal read/write access to it.\nThe problem is that Finder doesn't list it in the list of drives that it sees.\nHow can I get Finder to recognize the drive?\nHow can I get OSX to use the ntfs-3g program that allows read/write access instead of whatever it normally uses when connecting an external NTFS drive?\nIf I let OSX automatically mount the drive and type mount, this is what I get for the external drive.\n\n/dev/disk2s1 on /Volumes/Expansion Drive (ntfs, local, nodev, nosuid,\n  read-only, noowners)\n\nThe problem is the part that says \"read-only.\" How can I remove that?\n\nA: I finally got it working. I used the info at this site. The instructions are now included in brew installations.\nBasically use brew or macports to install ntfs-3g, fuse4x, and fuse4x-kext.  If you have an icon in System Preferences for fuse or macfuse, remove those, you don't need them. Follow the instructions after you finish installing them. You can also use brew info to see those instructions if you missed them before.\nWhen I did brew info ntfs-3g I found this.\nTo replace the default Mac OSX automounter:\n    sudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.orig\n    sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/ntfs-3g/2012.1.15/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs\n\nI also did brew fuse4x-kext and found this.\n  sudo cp -rfX /usr/local/Cellar/fuse4x-kext/0.9.0/Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext /Library/Extensions\n  sudo chmod +s /Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext/Support/load_fuse4x\n\nAfter running those commands I got the ntfs drives to automount and be visible in Finder with read/write access.\n", "Q: MacBook Air Charger 45w vs 65w Can you use a 65W apple charger instead of the 45w charger that comes with the Macbook Air? How will this affect the machine. \n\nA: This will not affect the Mac at all. It will not charge faster. It will not damage your battery. It will not damage your adapter. \nInformation on power adapters is detailed on Apple's support site: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2346\n\nA: Yes this is fine (assuming you refer to the 60W Magsafe) and this has been confirmed by Apple to be safe\n\nAlthough you should always use the proper wattage adapter for your Apple portable, you can use an adapter of a higher wattage without issue.\n\n\nA: \nTo find the right charger for Macbook ,there are three kinds of power rating Macbook power adapter in the market,45 watt, 60 watt, or 85 watt. It should be noted that higher wattage chargers can be used on the lower wattage laptops, but not vice versa.For example,If you have mac laptops that have used all three wattages. you could buy the 85w ones as my back up. Why? Because the 85w will work on any laptop, but the 45 and 60 will not. Further, the cost difference between the 45w, 60w and 85w is virtually nothing so you might as well “go big” and never worry if you have the right adapter for the right laptop.You can also find the Power Rating details on your orignal macbook charger and get the same Power Rating as your origanl macbook charger .\n\nFrom: http://www.eachbattery.com/guide/how-to-choose-the-right-macbook-charger/\n\nA: It DOES charge quite a bit faster. Just enough to make it more practical. \nBut I won't use it if it will spoil the battery sooner. I don't really trust the algorithms controlling the charging parameters. \n\nA: You can use the 85w too, but bear in mind that periodic use of power adapter with more wattage, will decrease your battery life. I can't find the link for that information, but it has been mentioned to me in at least three different Apple Stores by different employees when I lost (twice!) my 45w power adapter and needed to buy a new one; the first stores didn't have stock for the 45w and they strongly advised me against buying the 60w version. I ended up finding a 45w later that day. \nYour battery will charge slightly faster and that is not good. There's a reason why each machine has a different battery size and therefore a different power adapter. \nOccasional usage of a different model is ok. For example if you're running low and need to keep working or something like that, but don't buy one and use it all the time.\n", "Q: How can I get Xcode to support tabs over the jump bar? I selected View -> Tab Bar to enable tabs in Xcode.\nHowever, when I open a new file, it appears in the jump bar below the single existing tab and not as a new tab.\nHow do I get new files to appear as new tabs in Xcode? I've been spending some time trying different things out.\n\nA: Double clicking your source files in the Navigator pane should make them appear in new tabs.\n\nA: Use Command+T to create new tabs. Then on whatever tab is active a single click on source files sets its context.\n", "Q: How do I set the default file permissions for GUI apps in Lion? I've set my umask in my .bashrc file to 007. Any files created on the command line after loading my bashrc file respects this setting. I want to be able to set the umask to 007 for any files created using non-command line apps.\nThis document talks about setting the umask via launchd. And it kind of works. If I follow these directions I can change the default permissions on a GUI created file from rw-r--r-- to rw-rw---- but the directories still are not group writeable (i.e. I want them to be rwxrwx--- but they are rwxr-x--- instead)\nThe analog on Linux would be /etc/login.defs as the place to set the umask.\nWhat do I change in order for the umask to be set properly (i.e. the way I want it)?\n\nA: I think you have done what you could; the umask really is 077. When programs create files or directories via the mkdir system call, they specify a mode. The file or directory ends up with a mode which is the specified mode, but with any 1 bits from the umask cleared. So in all likelihood, the GUI programs create their directories with a specified mode 755, and if so, there is no change of the umask that will help. (If all GUI programs do this, it is probably because they all use the same library to create the directories they want to exist.)\n", "Q: Is it possible to link Private Keys and Certificates across Keychains? I've been given ownership of various iOS apps to build, and submit to iTunes Connect, but have run into a very obnoxious issue. Distribution Certificates must be uniquely named, and due to various reasons I have 2 certificates with a single individuals name.\nIf there are duplicate named certificates, even though they have unique IDs, the build process dies with a Code Sign error that states certificates must be uniquely named. This leads me to a situation where I have to delete the signed certificate(s) I have, download the one I want, rinse, repeat.\nAnd now there's a more difficult problem. I'm reaching a point where these builds are mostly able to be run completely automated via the xcodebuild and xcrun command line binaries, except for the above problem.\nIs it possible to store the Public/Private keys somewhere \"global\", that will be available to any keychain request, and make a new keychain to hold only a single signed certificate, but allow the two keychains to work together in order to pass code signing?\n\nA: It is not possible to link private keys and certificates across multiple Keychains. There needs be a third hidden item called an identity that bonds these two items together. The identity, certificate, and private key need to be in the same Keychain.\nSpecify the Keychain\nUsing Keychain Access, create a separate Keychain with a certificate and private key in each. In your situation this will mean creating two separate keychains.\nTell codesign to look for your specific Keychain using the command line option --keychain; the path provided to the Keychain must be absolute.\nYou can provide this option and path to codesign within Xcode through the build settings user interface.\n", "Q: How to stitch several photos into a single one using Mac OS X in 360 mode or simple? Microsoft made the PhotoSynth application for iPhone but forgot to create one for OS X.\nHow do I stitch several photos into single one, free apps would be preferable.\n\nA: I found Hugin to be the best free alternative to PhotoSynth. I only used the Windows version but they have Mac builds too.\nPTgui is a commercial alternative to Hugin using the same core library. I remember giving it a spin and not being impressed over Hugin.\nAnother commercial alternative is Autopano (started as a free GUI to panorama tools and went beyond that with PRO and Giga versions). I has a more polished look and feel and the Giga version is targeted at really large panoramas (think 26 gigapx).\n\nA: I've become acquainted with a few models of Canon and Nikon point-and-shoot digital camera; all models in both brands came with panorama software. If your digital camera came with a software CD, you might stick it in and see what it installs.\n\nA: DoubleTake is not free but you can use the demoversion. I use it to stitch together not photos but screenshots and similar graphics. Most panorama creatings programs does not work very well with \"GIF-like\" graphics and typically expecting horizontal rather than vertical stitches but DoubleTake does an excellent job with that.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade my MacBook mid 2010 to 16GB of RAM? (2x8G) I bought a MacBook mid 2010 which I have upgraded to 8GB of RAM. But now, 8GB is not enough for me. I need more RAM for my work.\nCan I upgrade my MacBook's RAM to 16GB? I know the new Macbook Pros can do it, but I am not sure about mine.\n\nA: I am actually shocked. I've just tested my Macbook Pro 17\" core i7 2.66Ghz,  2010 model and Core i5 2.53Ghz 15\" 2010 Macbook Pro.\nI put 2 8GB memory sticks (total of 16GB), and it's shows in About my Mac. \nSo 2010 models do accept 16GB of RAM.\n\nA: (Note: The original post said \"No\", which was right at the time it was written, but as of February 15th, 2014, the OWC page says that you can install up to 16GB of RAM on mid 2010 MacBooks (2.4GHz).)\nIt Depends.\nOWC continously tests the max RAM which apple computers support - which is usually more than Apple officially states.\nThe mid-2010 MBP is size dependent. The 13\" will support 16GB. The 15\" and the 17\" will not.\nThe following table shows that the max RAM supported by your Macbook Pro based off size (mid 2010) is 16GB (officially 8GB).\n\n\nA: Any mid-2010 MacBook Pro i5 or i7 is limited to a maximum of 8GB RAM. If you have a 2010 MacBook Pro Core2Duo (13\"), then you are in luck and you can upgrade to 16GB RAM.\nThe type of RAM needed is DDR3 PC3-8500 1066. \nI believe there is an EFI limitation in OS X Mountain Lion that will not allow the 2010 i5/i7 Macbook Pro's to be upgraded over 8GB RAM. After doing some digging around, it sounds like the limitation has to do with the IntelHD graphics SW that is used by OS X.\nSome datapoints to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*A 2010 i5/i7 MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM running MountainLion/Mavericks will kernel panic during normal boot.\n\n*You will be able to boot into safe mode OK and it will show the 16GB RAM in System Information. Notice that the graphics card is listed as \"Nvidia ...\" in safe mode, as opposed to \"IntelHD...\".\n\n*It is possible to limit Max RAM to 8GB using the command: sudo nvram \"-v maxmem=8192\". This would limit the usable RAM to a maximum of 8GB (official Apple Max); however this also will cause a kernel panic during normal boot when 16GB RAM is physically loaded. A maxmem=2048 will allow the system to boot normally with 16GB RAM loaded; however only 2GB RAM will be usable.\n\n*If you load Ubuntu 12 onto the MacBook Pro (2010 i5 or i7) with 16GB RAM loaded, Ubuntu will boot OK and be able to see/address the 16GB RAM.\n\n*If you load Windows 7 onto the MacBook Pro (2010 i5 or i7) with 16GB RAM loaded, Windows 7 will boot OK and be able to see/address the 16GB RAM.\nAs far as I can tell, this appears to be an Apple SW limitation of some sort.\n\nA: I had 16GB stuffed into my first generation unibody 17\" MBP.\nNow I'm back down to 8GB, swapping the two sticks with my 2011 Mac mini.\nI've stuffed a few more recent MBPs with 16GB, regardless of OWC or Apple have to say.\n\nA: OWC now shows that your MacBook can support up to 16GB of RAM. Check that page out for yourself. Seems like it was recently updated.\n\nA: It accepts it but won't let you use it while using an apple OS. It is clearly a software problem and it is shocking that apple will not give an update to solve this issue!!!\n", "Q: How to properly use drag and drop with MacBook Pro on OS X 10.7? It seems extremely hard to be able to drag and drop files between two finder windows with a single move on the trackpad - as soon you reach the end of the trackpad you'll drop the files,… in the wrong place.\nHow can you solve the drag'n'drop problem without using a mouse and still be able to use gestures?\n\nA: You can use your thumb to click on the lower part of the track and the index finger to move. As long as you keep the trackpad pressed with the thumb you can release the index finger.\n\n\nA: Holding with your thumb and dragging kills the thumb after a while. You can enable double tap to select (versus clicking) and drag in preferences> accessibility under the mouse area in Yosemite. Then just tap lightly twice and drag with your finger. You might need to have tap to click enabled under the trackpad settings. That's the best way to do it if you're on your machine all day and prone to repetitive strain injury.\nUpdate: I'm now using 3 finger drag available in the accessibility settings area.\n\nA: Click and Drag\nPress the physical button, then drag. While the button is depressed, you can reposition your \"dragging\" finger without letting go of what you're dragging.\nOne-Finger Tap & Drag\nWith Dragging enabled, tap the trackpad twice and start dragging on the second tap (instead of lifting your finger from the trackpad). There is a short delay from when you lift your finger from the trackpad and when the drag actually ends, during which, you can reposition your finger on the trackpad to continue dragging. To end a drag immediately (without the delay) you can tap the trackpad again.\nThree-Finger Drag\nTap the trackpad with three fingers and drag all three fingers. This has the same delay as the one-finger drag, so you can reposition your fingers and continue dragging. Again, a single tap will end the drag without the delay.\nDrag Lock\nDrag Lock works with both the \"one-finger tap & drag\" and the \"three-finger drag\". When enabled, the drag does not end after lifting your finger(s) from the trackpad. Rather you have to tap/click the trackpad to end the drag.\nIn Snow Leopard, the Dragging and Drag Lock settings are in System Preferences > Trackpad, but in Lion they were moved to System Preferences > Universal Access > Mouse & Trackpad > Trackpad Options.\nWith Dragging enabled, you may notice a delay when tapping compared to when it's disabled (at least in Lion).\nThree-Finger Drag with Inertia\nThis is easily the most fun way to drag. This is like the three-finger drag, but instead of moving all three fingers, you only move one finger, keeping the other two in place on the trackpad. When you do this, you can use a flick gesture with the finger that's moving and whatever you're dragging will continue to move after you lift that finger, gradually slowing down. It works very much like scrolling with inertia. As long as you keep your other two fingers in place on the trackpad, you can lift your third finger without letting go of what you're dragging.\nIf you wanted to, you could actually keep one finger in place on the trackpad and use two fingers for dragging, but that's a bit awkward.\n\nA: I turned on 3 fingers for dragging in the trackpad preferences. There also used to be an option on there called Click lock, where you would double click and drag and then the file would stay with the mouse until you clicked again. I can't seem to find that particular option anymore, but I know that if you enable the three finger dragging gesture that it's supported, so you just tap twice with three fingers on the file you want and then start dragging, and tap again when you want to drop the file.\n\nA: Another technique to avoid premature dropping is to take advantage of trackpad acceleration.\nLet's say you are dragging a file from left to right. When you run out of room on the right edge of the trackpad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Slowly drag the file to the left side of the trackpad.\n\n*Then quickly drag the file to the center/right of the trackpad. Due to difference in acceleration, you should be on the right half of your screen.\n\n*Now you have of lot of space to move before dropping.\n\n\nThis also works for a mouse if you run out of mousepad or desk space.\n\nA: Instead of using trackpad gestures for App Exposé and Mission Control -  it's more reliable to use hot corners instead.\nThe setting can be found under System Preferences → Mission Control → Hot corners...\nIf you want to avoid accidental tiggering of hot corners, you can add modifier-keys to them (i.e. trigger by ⌥+dragging to corner).\n\n", "Q: Lock & Unlock the screen via WLAN - Keyboard I use Synergy to share my mouse and keyboard across different computers. \nNow i want to lock and unlock the screen of my mac. I have activated corners, so when i move my mouse at the left corner of my screen, it gets dark.\n\nBut when i want to unlock the screen, nothing happens! My Mac doesn't\n  recognize any mouse movements or keyboard actions.\n\nI need to lock & unlock the mac screen for testing purpose. \nIs there any script command which can lock and unlock my screen by itself? \n\nFor example: lock my screen for 5 secondes, and unlock it again after\n  this period of time.\n\n\nA: You may be able to work something together in automator but I am not too familiar with that app.\nI would check and see if you have wake for network access on. \nIn System Preferences->Energy Saver there is a checkbox to \"wake for network access\". If that is unchecked it is unlikely your computer will respond since I believe that app is based on Networking\n[UPDATE]: Doing a quick search it appears other users are experiencing this issue with synergy and lion. take a look here\n", "Q: What does iTunes Match think a specific track is? I have one track of an album that got matched, while the other 22 didn't; therefore, I'm sure that there must be a compilation with this track that iTunes Match knows about. How can I check which track actually got matched to?\n\nA: It uses \"digital fingerprinting\" to match the track. The exact method is secret.  I've got lots of albums where a few tracks didn't get matched.\n", "Q: Does Apple still make iMovie HD available to iLife users? When Apple \"upgraded\" iMovie back in 2008 from its previous version to the completely rewritten program with a star-shaped icon, they kept the previous version available for download.\nCurrently, I can't find the older version of iMovie on Apple's site. My question is either a) is there still a legal way to get iMovie HD or b) when did it cease to be available?\n\nA: No. Apple has removed it from the download section of their site as of about January 26, 2009. See: http://www.macrumors.com/2009/01/27/imovie-hd-6-no-longer-available-for-download/\nThe direct download link in that article now returns a 404 error.\n", "Q: VM size in Activity Monitor: hundreds of GB? When I open the Activity Monitor, I get something looking like this: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1342.\nBut why the heck is \"VM size\" around 100-200 GB??\nHere is the capture from the apple support:\n\nSee the \"VM size: 172.23 GB\".\nIs that a bug, or can you explain to me where are those GB?\n\nA: They are virtual and cost nothing to make.  The VM hands out space to each program that asks for any but leaves tons of room to grow between each real allocation. These virtual addresses get mapped into the real RAM space as needed and mapped out when they are freed or otherwise inactive. They can even get paged to your storage if needed. \nYou can reboot to convince yourself it starts back at zero. This is expected that it grows over time and not a bug. The real query is what apps are requesting all that data and if you don't mind looking at files in the terminal sudo sysdiagnose is a great tool to dive deeper into virtual and real memory allocation. \n", "Q: How do I make a custom context menu item in Finder? I do a lot of command line work, which involves a lot of folder navigation with cd.\nTo make my life easier, I'd love to be able to right-click on a folder in Finder and have a context menu item I could click that simply opens Terminal and cds to that directory.\nHow would I go about this in OS X (Snow Leopard)? I'm a website developer, so familiar with programming languages and computer literate, so feel free to get technical with me.\n\nA: If you want the cd command in a new window or tab, you can simply turn on the built-in services, \"New Terminal at Folder\" and \"New Terminal Tab at Folder\", by going to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services > Files and Folders.\nIf you want the cd command in the active window or tab, you can make a simple Automator Service. \n\n\n*\n\n*In a new Automator Service, change \"Service receives selected\" to folders.\n\n*Add a \"Run AppleScript\" action.\n\n*Replace (* Your script goes here *) with the following:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    reopen\n    activate\n    set cmd to \"cd \" & quoted form of posix path of input\n    try\n        if busy of selected tab of window 1 then error\n        do script with command cmd in window 1\n    on error\n        do script with command cmd\n    end try\nend tell\n\n\n*Save the service with whatever name you want your menu item to have, then it's ready to go.\nAn alternative to using a contextual menu is to just type cd (with a trailing space) then drag the folder to the Terminal window.\n\nA: If you use iTerm2 (free), you can right click > Services > New iTerm2 Window Here.\n", "Q: Mini display port cable and Thunderbolt cable compatibility I need to run a Mini DisplayPort cable from a last generation Xserve to a circa late 2010 iMac so I can directly share the iMac's display while I set up the Xserve.\nApple no longer carries Mini DisplayPort cables at their stores here in NY.  No one at the store could tell me if I could use a Thunderbolt cable with the hardware I have.\nSo, a hopefully simple backwards compatibility question: Can I use a Thunderbolt cable to connect the Mini DisplayPort of the Xserve to the Mini DisplayPort of the iMac?\n\nA: According to this source, you will not be able to use a Thunderbolt cable in this fashion. \nYou can, however, get a Mini DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable from Monoprice for about $5 and that should work just fine.\n", "Q: How do I view which devices are connected to my AirPort Extreme using AirPort Utility v6.0?

Sometimes I notice that the process Python hung up. Then I'll kill it via the Activity Monitor and everything is fine.\nI'd like to kill that process in the Terminal instead. However, looking up the PID seems kind of unecessary because there's only one process by the name Python. \nIs it possible to kill a process by its unique name?\n\nA: You can kill Applications by using Activity Monitor.app, being the GUI solution. That would be a simple \"force quit\". However, that doesn't always work out for different reasons in some situations!\nThe command-line solution as mentioned in the comment above holds a lot more options for the user. sudo killall Python or if it is a running program-process sudo killall /Applications/Whatever.app forces the the process to quit as well. \nYou can also force a process to quit, using its assigned PID. In the case of Activity Monitor.app it would be kill 25794 or kill -9 25794\n\nSome more details:\nThe kill program in Terminal simply force quits a program, as though by remote control.

I'm away that instruments can do this from it's preferences, but that's a bit inconvenient. There also used to be a \"Processor\" system pref, but doesn't work on lion since it's 32-bit.\nIs there any other way? perhaps a menubar app or terminal command that can be scripted?\n\nA: Disabling cores does not save power.  In fact, it is likely to use more power.\nOS X supports SpeedStep, which automatically scales frequency and voltage to support the operation being performed.  So if a core is not being used, it will not use (much) power.\nBut there is more:\nSuppose you have a task which can be run in parallel, such as encoding video.  If you have two cores, you can run it at least twice as fast with one.  This means that the computer can stop using energy for other tasks needed for the process - processor overhead, RAM allocation, hard drive I/O, etc much sooner.\nAlso, while that long process is running, it has to keep switching all the other tasks the computer normally does.  This wastefull switching itself is going to use power and resources.\nSee this StackOverflow thread for a longer explanation.\n(Here is the Apple page on the Processor preference pane and how to disable cores from the command line.)\n", "Q: Two Time Capsules in one network, Macbook connects to the slower one when backing up I have two time capsules. They are connected via an ethernet cable and are part of the same wifi network. My devices connect to the one which has the better signal.\nThe problem is that my Macbook Pro always connects directly to the one where I store my Time machine backups when backing up (every hour). It happens even in cases where the signal is pretty bad and normally the other capsule would be used.\nCurrent behavior\nMacbook connects to tc2 when backup is in progress even though tc1 is closer and tc2 is in the same network:\n                    [Macbook]............(wifi)..........................\n                                                                        |\n   [tc1]                                                              [tc2]\n\nDesired behavior\nMacbook connects to tc1, since it's closer, and runs the backup through it:\n      .....(wifi)....[Macbook]\n      |                                               \n   [tc1]........................(ethernet)...........................[tc2]\n\nIs there a way to tell Time machine to always use the Time Capsule wich has the better signal?\n\nA: You don't explicitly state it, but is one of the APs extending the other, or are they both separate network IDs?\nIf they are participating in what used to be called a WDS extended network, then it's tricky to tell it which one to use.  But if you have them operating separate SSIDs, then you can simply not store the password to the one that is furthest away and allow the macbook to not even have a choice.\nIf you already have the 2 routers connected over cable, then there is absolutely no need for them to broadcast the same SSID other than for neatness.  Usually when you do that, it it because one it extending the range of the other by repeating the signal.  This is utterly redundant in your scenario, and you are far better off forcing any traffic that enters the network on Router A to route over ethernet to Router B if it is required.\nHaving a repeated wireless means you have 2 possible identical access points to connect to and having it potentially connect to the wrong one, and even if it connects to the right one, it will still just subsequently pass it back to the other one over Wifi thus negating the denefit of the lovely wired link you have.  It won't dump that traffic onto the local wired LAN to traverse over to the other router.  WDS is for when you can't link via a cable.\nThere are other considerations:\nYour links speed to one AP may be faster than to another, but that doesn't consider (or even tell) what the link speed \"back to base\" is.  Imagine this.  You sit 30 metres from 1 wifi AP, and 70 from another, each of you in a straight line.  Your strongest signal is clearly from the one 30 meters away.  However your best connection may be to do the 70 meter link to the furthest point instead, as it will be closer and likely faster than going 30 meters in one direction to what appears to be the best conection, which then needs to go 100 meteres back the other way to complete the route.\nAlso, don't go thinking 300Mb wireless is faster than 100Mb wired.  It's not.  The speeds shown are for total bandwidth speeds, not usable bandwidth.  Wifi has considerable overhead that ethernet does not, including extended packet information for encrypted packets and associated handshaking etc etc that a wired LAN link will not have.\n\nA: I'm not familiar enough with how Time Machine works to know this for sure, but I suspect the devices have some sort've unique ID that is stored and used, when TM is doing a backup, in order for TM to know which device to use.  Try this.\nUnplug TM2.  Go into your Time Machine prefs, and disable backups.  Make sure you're still connected to your network (if it was connected to TM2 it will now re-connect to TM1).  Re-enable backups, wait for it to find TM1.  Initiate a backup, and wait for it to finish.  Now re-connect TM2 and force another backup.  See where it goes.\nIf it goes to TM2 - let me know, I have another idea.\nIf not, we're not done yet, further testing!  Move the laptop closer to TM2 (and verify that it is in fact connected to TM2, by holding option and clicking your WiFi menu up top -- and verify the BSSID matches TM2's MAC address.)  Now re-run the backup.  Did it go to TM1?\nIf so, you're done.\n", "Q: How do I make my external Thunderbolt 27\" display's brightness match my iMac's brightness? I'm running my 27\" iMac with a 27\" Thunderbolt display, and I'm having trouble getting their brightnesses to match. It seems like checking \"Automatically adjust brightness\" on both causes different results.\nWhat's the best way to get these two displays to always have the same brightness?\n\nA: The best, albeit somewhat expensive, way is to use a spectrophotometer to create accurate color profiles for each of the two monitors. Short of that, you can use the built-in calibration software, accessed using the Monitors control panel, to create the profiles by eye.\nAccording to Apple's documentation on Calibrating displays with built-in ambient light sensing you should disable the automatic feature while creating the color profile. They claim you can then re-enable it, but for color critical work I would consider leaving this function disabled and controling the environmental light instead.\nUnfortunately, there are reports of Mac OS X 10.7 not working properly using different profiles for two monitors. You may have to manually (or use an Automator script to) assign the correct profile to each monitor after every restart.\n", "Q: How can I redownload apps I deleted outside of iTunes?

As I know that backing up through syncing can be problematic, I backed up by right-clicked on the iPhone and clicking \"back up\". I did this multiple times (to both the computer and to iCloud) and each finished successfully without error, as it said \"Last restored: 12:05\" for both.\nSo when I was setting up the new iPhone (on the phone itself), I signed into her Apple ID account (which was successful) and chose \"Restore from iCloud\" and it said \"No backups available\". \nI thought that was odd, so I selected \"Restore from iTunes\" and went onto iTunes. There are NO backups available for her iPhone (\"Jackie's iPhone\"). NONE. Not even the older ones which were there the other day! All of mine are there (\"Ben's iPhone\") for the past year or so and NOTHING ELSE. In this situation everyone always says that iTunes has simply lost track of the backups and that they're still in the filing system. Next, I went to \"%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\" and they aren't there either.. So, I enabled hidden folders, hidden protected Operating System files and checked my Recycle Bin (which hasn't been emptied for days) and there is NO trace that they were ever there. The amount of folders in MobileSync\\Backup perfectly match the amount of Restore options in iTunes..\nHow has this happened? I've restored her iPhone from her backups before without issue. How could they have disappeared?\nUpdate \nI set up the iPhone as a new phone, signed in to iCloud and reviewed the settings and it seems that iCloud backup was never enabled and no iCloud space has been used. I don't know whether this is only disabled because it's a newly setup phone and it's a per-device setting or what, but it could potentially explain the lack of iCloud backups. Also, when I went to sign into iCloud in Settings (after a complete restore to factory settings and basic configuration) my personal email address, not hers, was already in the login field, despite me never having entered it in the setup process at all. Something weird's going on here..\n\niPhone: 4 \niOS: 5.0.1 \nJailbroken State: Never \nOperating System: Windows 7 Ultimate, x64\n\nA: I don't have a great answer - but this is fairly serious so I'm going to start an answer and hope someone else edits or answers if they can spot something I haven't.\nOn the computer, the only \"red flag\" would be if you wiped the phone of all content and settings, named it exactly the same name as it was before (which could be iPhone) and then backed up again and overwrote the backup with the actual data. iTunes tries hard to prevent this and spawn off a date-protected backup when it detects this, but I've seen this check fail and people lose backups from time to time. The remedy here is to restore the PC from a backup that has whatever MobileSync folder is the most recent.\nOn iCloud - you also shouldn't be able to overwrite a \"full\" backup with an empty one. Also, iCloud explicitly keeps several versions of the backups going back in roughly day intervals. It also normally stores backups for different devices without collisions or overwriting another backup.\nThe good news on iCloud is you can always get help from Apple at http://www.apple.com/support/icloud/ and from retail stores. New devices or ones covered by Apple Care also have phone or web support in most countries. All new Apple products have a 90 day window of set up help. Hopefully one of these can step in and assist. Not only does Apple get a data point where their tools let you down (and exactly what circumstances this happened) - they also see many people in this situation and will hopefully waste a minimum of your time getting this sorted.\n\nA: I have the same problem I have ios 5.1 I went to the apple store to get a new phone cause mine was defective hit restore and nothing was there. However if I set it up new I see the backup there I called apple they said they don't know what's going on so they will investigate I paid to get extra storage I lost all my babies pics I'm upset hope apple fixes it. \n\nA: Ok guys I figured it out. If anyone has the problem where u get a new phone you wanna restore from ICloud backup and it says no backups available. Then you call apple senior rep and he can't help. Setup your iPhone as new iPhone or whatever you have. Then go to iCloud in settings if you see your old backup that you were trying to get to from the restore screen do this backup your new iPhone it should replace the existing backup. Once you back that up go to reset in settings erase all settings then try it again restore from ICloud backup and you should see it there I was here all day trying to figure this out hope it helps someone. \n\nA: The backups were unrecoverable.

Im buying an iphone for my friend, which knows nothing about technology, im planning to download apps for him.\nCan i use my apple id store  and download what I already purchased with my iphone (so that I can download them for free for him)?\n\nA: If you choose to do so, your friend will not be able to update apps without knowing your password. If you give your friend your password, they will then be able to shop for apps using your account.  The other problem is that your friend may not be able to sync with his/her computer without erasing the apps.\nThe last problem is Apple restricts each Apple ID to a fixed number of devices in a rolling window. At the moment, I believe you generally get frozen after 10 devices in a short time. I was setting up a deployment of 100 iPads using iCloud backups, and we hit a 90 day freeze for that account after 10 devices hit the App Store. We didn't care about updating apps - the end users were to delete these free apps once training was completed and part of the training was for them to make their own accounts and re-download the things we \"staged\" for initial training.\n\nA: If I recall correctly, what you are planning to do may violate the ToC set but if you still insist, Apple's website highlights the following restrictions:\nYour Apple ID can have up to 10 devices and computers (combined) associated with it. Each computer must also be authorized using the same Apple ID. Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple ID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID for 90 days.\n(Note you still have to Authorize all computers you are planning to sync from - so they count in the ten device limit as well as each iOS device).\nHere is the relevant quote:\n(i) You may download and sync an App Store Product for personal, noncommercial use on any iOS Device you own or control.\nThe legal definition of control is vague for what your particular use is, but you are more likely to end up limiting your number of registered devices on your Apple ID if used incorrectly\n\nA: \"Downloading for free\" of purchased apps by another person is certainly not something Apple would like. You can technically do that, however you have to also let his device sync to your iTunes library and let him use your Apple ID and password each time he needs to update the installed apps in this way. In short: your friends' device must be considered by apple as one of your devices.\n", "Q: Apple Airport - Access DHCP from ethernet connection? Is it possible to have a device connected to an Airport Express via the ethernet cable to access the DHCP / sit within the NAT functionality for Internet use?\nI have an existing network where a network switch connects to both the cable modem and the Airport Express. This currently works.\nI am now trying to add a wired device (an XBox 360) to the switch. All attempts to sit within the Airport's subnet have failed (manual IP setup, tested with various pings, etc). This leads me to the conclusion that all devices receiving DHCP/NAT connectivity must be wirelessly connected.\nAs the Airport is bridging the connection to the (internet) router, I'd like the XBox sitting within the router. The cable modem has a static IP, which doesn't share well with both the Aiport + XBox trying to use the Internet.\nIs there a way to to allow a device connected via ethernet within the subnet / DHCP-controlled zone?\nThe alternative is to replace it with a wireless router with a built-in switch.\nThanks.\n\nA: The DHCP works fine for the airport.\nIf you use ethernet and a static IP address, then you'll have to choose an IP address outside of the DHCP lease range otherwise you can get IP address conflicts.\nFor example, if your DHCP range is set to 192.168.0.10 through 192.168.0.20 then you can use the IP address ranges 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.9 and 192.168.0.21 - 192.168.0.253 for statically assigned IP address.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I'm a little confused by the wording of this question. But the Airport Express has two ethernet ports, one you'd connect to the \"source\" of your internet, your modem or whatever. The other is a standard network ethernet port. It gets the same exact services as wifi, but faster. You can easily plug in an un-managed switch to it, and have an array of fully functional ethernet ports. You can skip the switch and plug your xBox directly into this port and it should connect right up to the internet using DHCP, as long as DHCP is enabled in the airport. \nStatic IPs should work too, over wifi or ethernet. They have to be correct though, in the correct range with the right subnet and good DNS. I'd stick to DHCP though. You can create \"static\" IPs through the DHCP in the Airport which is a nice feature that makes it super easy to setup, if you happen to need a static LAN IP. \nHaving re-read your question, the key here is the Airport goes between the modem and the switch. The switch does not connect directly to the modem.\n", "Q: Not able to extract any .gz or .tar file (Mac OS X 10.5.8) I have Mac OS X 10.5.8.

I think its 4k. I need to confirm this. Diskutil reports that the disk blocksize is 512 bytes.\n\nA: You could try \"stat\" with the \"%k\" format option.  According to the man page this is the \"Optimal file system I/O operation block size\".  Command line is:\nstat -f \"%k\" FILE\n\nWhere \"FILE\" is any regular file on your system (e.g. \"~/.profile\"). It should say \"4096\" or something like that.  I cannot 100% guarantee this is what you're looking for, but it seems close.\n\nA: If you want to verify the block size, you can modify the answer given by neuroburn to include the file size and the number of 512-byte blocks allocated:\nstat -f \"%k, %z, %b\" FILE\n\nThe number of allocated 512-byte blocks will be a multiple of the number of 512-byte blocks in one file system block.  For example, a 4096-byte file system block contains 8 512-byte blocks:\nMacBook-Pro:~ ian$ echo foo > foo.txt\nMacBook-Pro:~ ian$ ls -l foo.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 ian  staff  4 12 Jul 00:21 foo.txt\nMacBook-Pro:~ ian$ stat -f \"%k, %z, %b\" foo.txt\n4096, 4, 8\n\nDoing this a few times will give more confidence in the simpler command proposed by neuroburn. (Please note this answer has been edited to correct the command parameters… former parameters \"%k, %z, %” caused the command to fail.)\n\nA: That's a fair enough measurement, but the right way to do it would be to query the filesystem itself, which you can do programmatically by statfs(). Alternatively, you can read directly from the HFS volume header - a free tool called HFSleuth, at http://www.newosxbook.com/ - allows you to do just that.\n", "Q: Can I get sound out of both iMac and attached Thunderbolt Display? I have a dual monitor setup (iMac + Thunderbolt Display). The System Preferences > Sound > Output setup only allows me to choose between one or the other monitor.

I have been running Time Machine to back up all files.\nSource of original problem: 1 TB hard drive developed problems while the machine was still under AppleCare.\nThe fix to the original problem: I took the machine to my nearest Apple store, where the diagnosis was to replace the hard drive. I got the repaired iMac back three days later.\nThe current problem:\nWhen I got home and powered the iMac up for the first time, I noticed that the Apple techs had already set up a new user account. Everything has been working fine, except that this new user account is not the same as the old one on the machine (i.e. the one I was using prior to the hard drive problem). \nAs a result, I can't seem to access any of the Time Machine backups I made prior to having the iMac repaired.\nQuestion:\nHow do I access the Time Machine backups made before the repair? Is there a way to query the Time Machine backups for the user account for which they were created?\n\nA: Migration Assistant\nThis is the built in data transfer tool for Macs.\nYou can find it in /Applications/Utilities.

On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable).

There are many times when I curse the autocorrection mechanism for changing what I typed, but overall, much of the corrections are welcome so I don't really want to disable it. I do want to have it do it's work but alert me when it makes each change so I don't have to proofread everything or focus with perfect attention to the screen to see the momentary red and/or blue underlining that alerts me to the machine override.\nI would love a way to turn on an audible beep (customizable of course) so that I also get a warning each time my typing gets corrected (and only when autocorrection occurs).\n\nA: Not exclusively, but there is a tool that will mark spelling and other changes with a sound.\nAs described in this answer, it is possible to detect the type of text field change that autocorrect uses programmatically. A sound is issued whenever any of the text changes - but this results in a lot of false positive \"sounds\" when autocorrect did not happen. A proof of concept app was released August 2011, so I hope it is still fully functioning. Direct download link: http://cl.ly/9CIZ.

The problem started after installing Lion.\nWhen I close the lid, it appears to go to sleep (i.e. the Apple logo dims) but the status LED stays on and within 5 seconds, the Apple logo is back on. Lifting the screen very slightly reveals that the screen is on at this point.\nI know that it's not sleeping and waking when I close the lid because syslog | grep -i \"wake reason\" does not show a wake entry for the time the laptop wakes up.\nSo far, I've tried PRAM reset, SMC reset, disabling all sharing and bluetooth options. It does sleep with the lid shut when booted in Safe Mode though. This leads me to believe that it's some kind of software or setting that's preventing sleep but I know no way of figuring this out.\nIs there any way to fix this or find out what software is preventing sleep?\n\nA: A lack of wake reason entries suggests your Mac is never fully sleeping. The sleep mechanism has started but never completes.\nUse the following Terminal command to view a detailed log showing your Mac's power history:\npmset -g log\n\nYou will see a list of entries in form:\n * Domain: applicationresponse.slowresponse\n - Message: PMConnection AirPort configd plug-in com.apple.powermanagement.applicationresponse.slowresponse 1399 ms\n - Time: 13/03/2012 12:27:53 CET \n - Signature: AirPort configd plug-in\n - UUID: AB482838-2D6E-0000-0000-14BF53E20000\n - Result: Noop\n - Response time (ms): 1399\n\nLook out for applications that may be keeping your Mac awake and active. Applications and other processes can keep your Mac awake if they are providing a service, such as file sharing or remote access. However, processes should be forced asleep after 30 seconds on lid close.\nThe behaviour you are seeing suggests a kernel extension or IOKit problem. User level processes can not block sleep when instigated by the user.\nDo you have any utilities installed that install kernel extensions (kext)? These might include screen recording or audio capture tools; utilities than need low level access to your Mac.\n\nA: It's worth repairing your permissions, if you haven't already done that. Permissions errors have caused a wide range of bizarre problems in the Lion upgrade.\nIt also might help to generate ideas if you can determine if the problem is system-wide or user-specific. Do that by creating a new, pristine user account and using that to see if the problem persists.\nA genuine \"clean install\" of Lion is still a debated procedure, but some people who exhaust all other diagnostic possibilities have ended up going that route with good success. I hope your problem is more straightforward than that!\n--\nEDIT:\nI gather that booting in Safe Mode solves the problem, but creating a new user doesn't. That strongly suggests the problem is something you're loading at startup. Good news is that this should be straightforward to fix.\nYour experiments so far suggest that whatever is causing the problem is in your /Library directory, and not in your User folder. A manageably small list of things is disabled during a Safe Mode startup, including /System/Library/Extensions, /Library/StartupItems, and notably, any fonts outside of /System/Library/Fonts. Your problem must be something in one of these locations.\nI have a funny feeling that you may have a corrupted font, since this is a common problem that manifests in odd ways. You could try the troubleshooting strategies described here, which essentially consist of validating the fonts using the Font Book utility (included with Mac OS X), clearing out the font cache, and removing any duplicates. \nIf fonts aren't the problem, this earlier discussion has good information about how to go about disabling errant startup extensions and login items. It's a matter of taking everything suspicious out, and adding things back bit-by-bit until you find your culprit.\nI think you're close to the solution, please do let us know when you've cracked it.\n\nA: Run the following command:\npmset -g assertions\n\nand list all system-wide assertions preventing your system sleep along with their processes.\n\nWhenever processes override any system power settings, pmset will list those processes and their power assertions in -g and -g assertions.\n\nNormally when nothing is stopping macOS from going to sleep, you should have all 0.

My language in the Language & Text system pref is set to English where ever possible. I am using Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: This problem seems to crop up occasionally, and I haven't heard a definitive solution outside of the standard troubleshooting routines: determine if the problem is a software setting by creating a new user account, rebuild permissions, and so on.\nBeyond the basics, there are two solutions that might help. First, in this thread over at the Apple discussion forums, someone has a similar problem and is able to resolve it by removing some spurious login items, then logging out and logging back in. It's worth looking at your login items suspiciously.\nSecond, you might try to change the system language to something new, like French. Log out and back in, then change back to English. It may be that you have some wonky settings left over from an old program, and that switching away from English and back re-aligns everything.\n", "Q: Dongles to connect 2 monitors to a 13\" mid-2010 MacBook Pro (mini DisplayPort)? I won't be using the integrated display. Right now, one external monitor is connected through a mini DisplayPort to VGA adaptor. How should I connect a second?\n\nA: Another option to to use a display multiplexer, like the Matrox DualHead2Go DP.  This will have much better performance (frame rate / snappiness) than the USB solution, at about 4X the price.  It's best with matched dual external displays - or triple; there's also a 3-monitor solution.  I haven't used one personally, but have recommended it to clients with success.  The reviews are quite good.\n\nA: An option for this MacBook Pro is to add a USB Video adapter to get that 2nd external monitor. They are available in a wide range of resolutions and connectivity. Not sure which is the best one to buy but here is an example of a USB 2.0 to DVI Display Adapter.\n\n", "Q: Is Front Row included with Lion?

I understand there is a button to email them, but I probably have accumulated 100 or so useful pdfs on my iPhone. \nI worry if I click sync books, it will erase everything I have on my iPhone and only use what's on my computer the first time I do it right? I have never synced it before loading the books.\nIs there any safe reliable (hopefully native) way to preserve books and PDF that were loaded natively from iOS? I do not want to risk losing them. I'm using iCloud, does that back them up as well? Either way I would like to have an extra copy of them on my hard drive.\n\nA: Grab a copy of iExplorer (freeware), connect your phone, open iExplorer, select your device, and navigate to Media > Books. All your PDFs should be there.\nHowever they all have cryptic names and there's no QuickLook in iExplorer, so you need to copy them all and then look which ones you need.\n\nA: Even though you've already solved it, I transfer in between my iPad/iPhone with Dropbox. I usually buy a lot of books on my iMac that are epub or pdf that aren't in iBooks, so the quickest way to transfer them and keep them backed up is in my dropbox. When you install the app on your phone, you can navigate to a book and select \"Open in iBooks\". It's a really handy way to transfer things in between the devices.\n\nA: Why not select share from the document in iBooks, then send it to yourself by email, then the attachment can be downloaded onto any computer from your email?\n\nA: I'm using Adobe Reader as a way to store and transfer PDFs through iTunes.\n\nA: None of the suggestions help if  you downloaded a file directly from the internet (say ORielly Books, or Safari Books), directly into iBooks.  You can't get anything out of iBooks into Dropbox, or your computer, without shelling out additional $$$$.\n\nA: As of iTunes 12.0.1, the \"Books\" section of the iTunes library seems to be missing, making this already tedious process even worse. Here are the highlights of the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*PDFs in iBooks (typically added on the device via the \"open in iBooks\" functionality) are not backed up in your iTunes/iCloud backups.\n\n*Syncing only transfers PDFs in the books category of your iTunes library to your device. (Syncing does not transfer anything from device to iTunes, so this makes sense.)\n\n*There is currently no automated system for pulling the iBooks PDFs to your iTunes library. You need to manually send the PDF to yourself (via email or another means.)\n\n*Since the books section of the iTunes library is M.I.A. you have to add the pdf to the music library, and then manually change it's type to books.\nYou can find the original illustrated guide to this hot mess under the bottom \"Bonus Tirade: Transferring PDFs from iBooks\" in this article I wrote: http://deciphertools.com/blog/2015_01_27_itunes_sync_vs_backup_ensure_data/\n\nA: Open iBooks on a Mac, and open the PDF file, which will be opened in Preview.

Still have a lot of duplicates. How do I get rid of the duplicates\n\nA: On your Mac, open the Address Book and goto Card → Look for Duplicates.\nYou'll be prompted with something like this:\n\nAfter merging the contacts in the Address Book you should choose to replace the contacts on the iPhone. This option can be found under the iPhone in the iTunes sidebar.\n\nA: Best to not sync your contacts with iTunes and a cable if you're using Mobile me and/or iCloud. The duplicates are probably because you're looking at what's on your computer combined with what's on iCloud.\nOnce you choose to sync with iCloud turn off contacts and calendar sync through iTunes. This was true in the \"old\" Mobile Me days and it's still true with iCloud.\n\nA: Follow these official steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a copy of your contacts.\n\n*Open Contacts app.\n\n*From the Card menu, select Card > Look for Duplicates.\n\n*When asked, click Merge.\n\n*Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no duplicates are found.\n\n*Make another copy of your iCloud Contacts at Apple Support.\n\n\nSource: If you see duplicate contacts after setting up iCloud Contacts.\n\nIf you see duplicates in Contacts on iCloud.com, visit Apple Support for help.\nIf you see duplicate contacts only on your computer and not on iCloud.com, follow the steps below. \nIf you see duplicates on your Windows PC, check these Microsoft articles for Outlook 2007, 2010, Outlook 2013 and 2016.\n\nA: Your problem obviously comes from the fact that you use both iCloud and iTunes to sync your contacts. \nThere is a bit of a complicated solution but which works. First switch off your iCloud contact sync. Next, go to iTunes and set up a Gmail iPhone contact sync. \nIf you don't have a Gmail account, create one. Next, sync all of your iPhone contacts with your (new) Gmail account. \nFinally, select \"Find and merge duplicates\" from your Gmail Contacts settings (by clicking on the \"More\" button). \nMake sure you effectuate a sync between your Gmail contacts and your iPhone once again (via iTunes). All of your duplicate contacts are now gone (and whenever needed - merged).\nGo to Gmail (from your web browser), and navigate to your Gmail contacts (all of your iPhone contacts should now live in your Gmail too).\n", "Q: Do I need a Thunderbolt display adapter or should an older mini DisplayPort adapter work? I am experiencing screen flicker (so bad as to be unusable) from a late 2011 Macbook Pro on an external display connected via a mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter (official Apple version). Is it possible that this is caused by not having a Thunderbolt to DVI adapter? Do I need to update the adapter or should this work? \n\nA: No, such an adapter does not exist and is unnecessary. Since Thunderbolt is backwards compatible with Mini Display port.   If you look at accessory options for the MacBook Pro, you will see only the following display output adapters available: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Apple Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter\n  \n*Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter\n  \n*Apple Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter\n  \n\nSo Mini DisplayPort is the correct adapter type. However, there are two DVI adapters to choose from. It depends on what display your are using and if it needs a single link or dual link DVI connection.\nGenerally speaking computer displays with a native resolution less than or equal to 1920 x 1200 are single link DVI, while displays larger than 1920 X 1200 are dual link DVI. Check your monitor's specification and requirements to be sure.\nIf you have the right resolution settings and adapter and the flicker persists I would trouble shoot and rule out each piece of hardware to figure out where the problem lies.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the display\n\n*With the adapter / cabling\n\n*With the MacBook Pro\n\n\nA: No, thunderbolt is backwards compatible with MiniDisplay Port. However, if you were using HDMI for example, you would need a newer adapter if you want to carry audio too.\n", "Q: Unable to Restore iPhone 4 and ERROR -50 I'm using Windows XP SP3. I installed iOS 5 on my iPhone 4. The installation process went OK, but, when trying to restore my contents, it gives me ERROR -50. I tried all the different things assosiated with this error.\nQuestion: The only things that I miss are photos and, of course, my text messages. Is it possible to get the photos from my backup files manually?\niTunes does not show that it actually backed up the data on that date. The backup before that was a month earlier, which is did allow me to restore, so I'm stuck with the loss of a month.\n\nA: This error (-50) usually happens when the location iTunes is trying to use for the backup is taking a long time to respond and times out (network share, iSCSI, USB/external storage...). If this is the case, the solution is to temporarily move iTunes backup/download location to your harddrive.\nHere's also a KB from Apple:\n\nError 13 and 14: These errors are typically resolved by performing one\n  or more of the steps listed below:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Perform USB isolation troubleshooting, including trying a different USB port directly on the computer. See the advanced steps\n  below for USB troubleshooting.\n  \n*Put a USB 2.0 hub between the device and the computer.\n  \n*Try a different USB 30-pin dock-connector cable.\n  \n*Eliminate third-party security software conflicts.\n  \n*There may be third-party software installed that modifies your default packet size in Windows by inserting one or more TcpWindowSize entries into your registry. Your default packet size being set incorrectly can cause this error. Contact the manufacturer of the software that installed the packet-size modification for assistance. Or, follow this article by Microsoft: How to reset Internet Protocol\n  (TCP/IP) to reset the packet size back to the default for Windows.\n  \n*Connect your computer directly to your Internet source, bypassing any routers, hubs, or switches.

In Little Snitch, I allowed port 80 when a \"google.com\" popup appeared on my screen. I'm wondering if that was a good idea.\nIf a hacker installed a program on my Mac, and that program sent information to a server,  would it go through \"internet\" and port 80? Considering this, is it safe to permanently allow port 80 traffic?\nOn the other hand, if I only accept \"google.com on port 80\" (instead of all sites on port 80) I get ten or 15 alert dialogs for each advertisement and service, on each website.\n\nA: No.\nIf, for all processes.\nPretty much yes.\nIf, only for web browsing.\n\nAs @StuWilson has pointed out, port 80 is for http traffic and port 443 is for https traffic. (http with TLS/SSL encryption).\nIt's not necessary to allow all traffic of all processes on port 80. But - for the sake of comfortable browsing - I strongly recommend enabling those ports for all traffic of webbrowsers  like Safari or Chrome.\nFor comparison, this is my setup of Chrome in HandsOff!:\n\n\n*\n\n*Basic communication\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow all outgoing network connections on port 443 (https)\n\n*Allow all outgoing network connections on port 80 (http)\n\n*Allow all domain resolving\n\n\n*Sync\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow all outgoing network connections to talk.google.com on port 5222\n\n\n*Other (e.g. media)\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow all outgoing network connections to atracktive.collegehumor.com on port 9090 (websm)\n\n*...\n\n\n\nSetting up a firewall can be quite a hassle. Generally - when I've expected a certain connection to build up, and know what it's for, I allow it. But you should only interfere network connections when you know what you're doing.\nMany system processses regulary build up (local) network connections that are certainly valid. If you don't know how to guard a firewall, you become the first security risk for your own computer. Make sure to educate yourself on network protocols when building your own firewall.\n\nA: Port 80 is the standard port for all HTTP traffic, so disallowing port 80 will give you a popup for all web browsers and web sites.\nLittle Snitch is about telling you what is on your machine trying to communicate with other things.\nRules are generally about Program A, Port B, Destination C\nSo you could have a rule that says, \"Safari\", Port 80, \"All Destinations\" which would allow Safari to browse the web, but that would stop Google Chrome doing the same.\nNote in the real world, there are other ports such as those for HTTPS (443) that would also be open.\n\nA: As @bmike said: port 80 is where just about every non-secure web browser is set to listen for incoming http connections by default. So any communication to unencrypted http services is going to require port 80 to be open.\nHowever, if you open up port 80 for every program, you're going to lose a lot of control over what information is being sent out of your machine (remember, Little Snitch is only an outbound firewall solution).\nLittle Snitch has the ability to set outbound connection rules on a program by program basis. If you're worried about programs sending out information without your authorization you really shouldn't ever set a general port rule in Little Snitch that allows any program to send out over the port. Instead of allowing all programs the ability to send information out over port 80 you should enable them one at a time. This can be arduous as a lot of programs are going to want to talk over port 80 but it's really the only way to ensure you know who is getting information about you.\nWhen Little Snitch asks if you want to allow or deny a program wanting to send out over a particular port select allow but for this program only. This way you know which programs you've authorized to use the port. If you wanted to get really controlling you could limit each program to the port and the specific address.\nYou'll basically never want to use the 'Global' tab in the Little Snitch allow dialog:\n\nThe tabs across the top of this box control how long the rule persists for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once: Just this one time. After one access, permission is revoked.\n\n*Until Quit: As long as the program stays open. After the process ID of the program changes, permission is revoked.\n\n*Forever: Across all instances of the program for ever more.\n\n*Global: Not just for this program, but any program that wants to use this port.\n\n\nThe list of options control how specific the rule is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any Connection: Allow it to use any port to connect to any destination\n\n*Only port 43 TCP (nicname): Allow to connect to any destination over port 43 using the TCP protocol\n\n*Only whois.arin.net: Allow it to connect to only the destination whois.arin.net over any port using any protocol\n\n*Only whois.arin.net and port 43 TCP (nicname): Allow to connect to only whois.arin.net and only over port 43 using the TCP protocol\n\n", "Q: Use MacBook Pro LCD Screen as a standalone monitor I have a broken MBP (2009, pre-unibody, 15\") with a screen which I know is working.\nI took it apart and there's this fancy connector, attached to the screen (sorry for branding):\nIs it possible to 'convert' this into a VGA or DVI or anything else, so I can use the screen as external monitor?\n\n\nA: That is a proprietary interface and there is not going to be a ready made solution to get it to adapt to being used as a stand alone screen separated from a Mac Book Pro.\nYour best bet would be to sell the MacBook Pro as parts on eBay or something and just buy an external LCD or put the cash towards your next computer.\nIts going to be an engineering effort as referenced in a similar question Can my Macbook Pro's display receive inputs from other sources?.  Here is the answer provided by \"Fake Name\":\n\nYes, but it's not worth it.\nYou would have to take the laptop apart, design and engineer a custom converter to drive the LCD interface (internally, it's going to use LVDS to handle the interface between the laptop's motherboard and the screen), and power it somehow. It also would probably render the macbook from which you removed the screen unusable as a laptop.\nIt would take a few hundred hours of engineering time, and cost a lot in prototypes.\nYou are better off just buying a separate LCD.\n\n\nA: You can check out how these guys do the very thing you're talking about at this link.

It's IPSec, FWIW. From time to time, it disconnects (probably an issue with my corporate server). Is there a way to get it to automatically reconnect? Sometimes I don't notice for a while, which is kinda annoying.\n\nA: There's an app that does it called VPN Auto-Connect (Mac App Store link). It's $0.99.\nOnce started, it lives in your menu bar; when you use it to turn VPN \"on\", it will monitor a VPN connection profile you set up in OS X's Network preference pane and ensure you always remain connected to it. VPN Auto-Connect's menu-bar icon provides a list of all the VPN connections you've defined and lets you choose which one to always connect to.\n\nA: You could use the following AppleScript, save it as an application and set it to be a agent (no dock icon).\nThis script will setup a VPN connection when there is none. Therefore, it should also reconnect shortly after your connection drops. You can change the interval to check your VPN connection, it's 120 seconds in the script.\non idle\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell current location of network preferences\n            set myConnection to the service \"VPN University\"\n            if myConnection is not null then\n                if current configuration of myConnection is not connected then\n                    connect myConnection\n                end if\n            end if\n        end tell\n        return 120\n    end tell\nend idle\n\nI've explained how to set this up in this answer.\n\nA: I made some changes to the provided answer, because if something is worth doing it's worth doing into the ground. I wanted to reconnect if the VPN was dropped, but NOT reconnect if the VPN was intentionally disconnected. The solution I came up with was both effective and inelegant.\nFirst I added hooks to the pppd startup and shutdown to keep track of the desired VPN state. These files should be owned by root, and have world read/execute permissions (sudo chmod 755 /etc/ppp/ip-*).\n/etc/ppp/ip-up:\n#!/bin/sh\necho true > /var/run/reconnect_vpn\nchmod 644 /var/run/reconnect_vpn\n\n/etc/ppp/ip-down: for OS X 10.9.5 and below\n#!/bin/sh\ntail /var/log/ppp.log | grep '\\[DISCONNECT\\]'\nif [ $? == 0 ] ; then\necho false > /var/run/reconnect_vpn\nfi\n\n/etc/ppp/ip-down: for OS X 10.10 and above\n#!/bin/sh\ntail /var/log/ppp.log | grep '\\[TERMINATE\\]'\nif [ $? == 0 ] ; then\necho false > /var/run/reconnect_vpn\nfi\n\nThen by modifying the AppleScript above, I was able to check the '/var/run/reconnect_vpn' status variable to determine whether to bring the VPN back up:\non idle\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell current location of network preferences\n            set myConnection to the service \"VPN\"\n            set startOnLogin to true\n            local doReconnect\n            try\n                set doReconnect to (do shell script \"cat /var/run/reconnect_vpn\")\n            on error errMsg\n                set doReconnect to startOnLogin\n            end try\n            if myConnection is not null and doReconnect then\n                if current configuration of myConnection is not connected then\n                    connect myConnection\n                end if\n            end if\n        end tell\n        return 120\n    end tell\nend idle\n\nAs before, change the line set myConnection to the service \"VPN\" to whatever your VPN is called. Also, on startup the 'reconnect_vpn' file doesn't exist, so I added a boolean (startOnLogin) to serve as the default when the file could not be found. I like to start immediately, but if you don't then change it to false.\nI have a feeling that if you're the kind of person is this particular about VPN behavior, then you're also the kind of person who likes fumbling around until you find a solution and therefore this answer has no audience. But just in case, here it is. Hope it helps somebody.\n\nA: I'm using different approach to keep my VPN connection alive.\nThis involves getting a very simple launchd daemon running which allows maintaining VPN connection without any user logged in (this also avoid VPN disconnection popups when resuming from sleep mode).\ncreate a launchd plist file from terminal :\nsudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/my.vpn.connector.plist\n\nand enter following content :\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>NetworkState</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>my.vpn.connector</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>bash</string>\n        <string>-c</string>\n        <string>(test $(networksetup -showpppoestatus MyVPN) = 'disconnected' &&  ping -o my.vpn.server.url && networksetup -connectpppoeservice MyVPN) ; sleep 10</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou can use following command to start your daemon and test:\nlaunchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/my.vpn.connector.plist\n\nThis way, you have a daemon running for all users, connection attempted only when internet connection is available. Also, VPN is reconnected automatically when internet connection is back…\nEdit: \nI find this method the most robust as it allows a vpn connect to be made automatically, before a user logs in (useful for servers).\nUpdates for Yosemite (OSX 10.10)\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>NetworkState</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n\nIs depreciated in Yosemite. You can use the following instead\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n\nAlso\nnetworksetup -connectpppoeservice MyVPN\n\nNo longer works in Yosemite. You can use this instead\nscutil --nc start MyVPN\n\n\nA: A new option is VPN Monitor available on the AppStore. It allows for more customization, like auto-login, cycling through VPN connections, etc. At least OS X 10.9 Mavericks required.\n\nA: Script auto-reconnect any dropped VPN service.\nI had been using rjarvis2010's solution but I wasn't quite happy with it.\nI have many different VPN services I connect to, so I wanted a script that would automatically reconnect any VPN I was connected to.\non idle\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell location \"Uni\" of network preferences\n            -- keep checking for VPN name until a VPN is connected\n            set empty to true\n            repeat until empty is false\n                try\n                    -- set variable \"myVPN\" to the name of the service that is connected and is a VPN\n                    set myVPN to get name of first service whose (kind is greater than 11 and kind is less than 17) and connected of current configuration is true\n                    set empty to false\n                on error\n                    set empty to true\n                    delay 15\n                end try\n            end repeat\n            \n            -- doReconnect is a file that reads from the ppp.log and contains \"true\" by default, \"false\" if the vpn service was manually disconnected recently\n            local doReconnect\n            set doReconnect to (do shell script \"cat /var/run/reconnect_vpn\")\n            \n            repeat while doReconnect contains \"true\"\n                set ConfProp to get current configuration of service myVPN\n                if connected of ConfProp is false then\n                    delay 1\n                    set doReconnect to (do shell script \"cat /var/run/reconnect_vpn\")\n                    if doReconnect contains \"true\" then\n                        try\n                            connect service myVPN\n                        on error errorMessage\n                        end try\n                    else\n                        exit repeat\n                    end if\n                end if\n                delay 5\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    return 1\nend idle\n\nTo make it work for you, you need to replace\n\n*\n\n*Uni with whatever your location's name is\n\nOnce you're done, save it as an application and place it in your Login Items and you're good to go.\nAlso, and this is important, you need to set up the PPP hooks as described in rjarvis2010's solution\nAlso, I would recommend you don't try this connecting multiple VPNs simultaneously.\nTo stop this script you might need to force quit it through the activity monitor (as the repeat loops don't allow it to receive external input at times).\n\nA: I saw that there are a few answers on here that use login hooks, those are deprecated in newer versions of OS X in favor of Launch Agent and Launch Daemons.\nI created a script and launch agent. The agent calls a shell script every 30 seconds and tries to ping an IP address that is static on the vpn network. If it cannot ping that IP it enables your vpn connection.\nIf you did this through an Apple Script App, the app icon will always be in your dock. I prefer to have this running automatically in the background.\nClone the project below and follow the directions in the readme. The end result is an installer package that will place a launch agent plist file in /Library/LaunchAgents/ and a shell script in /Library/Application Support/melonsmasher/. \nBe sure to edit the shell script(auto-vpn) with your VPN connection name and an IP address that is on the VPN network. You can change the run interval in the plist file(com.melonsmasher.autovpn.plist). \nhttps://github.com/MelonSmasher/OSX-AutoVPN \n\nA: The beauty of AppleScripts is that you can do almost anything with it and it's free, the downside is that they are usually not very responsive (polling at a fixed time interval) and lack features only native MAC OS X apps can have. A nice and new VPN auto reconnect app is \"VPN Monitor\" in the app store, it reconnects instantly the moment a VPN connection drops, is able to reconnect to a different VPN service if the preferred service is down, connects at start-up, keeps track of your downtime and uses a minimum of system resources to run in the background as a statusbar application. VPN Monitor\n", "Q: Reboots hang. Cold Starts Boot on iMac 27\" i7 (Mid 2010) I've been having a problem with my iMac i7 (mid 2010) for quite awhile. Any kind of restart from a software update, or a user selected restart, causing the iMac to get stuck on the restart gray screen with the rotating loading \"carat.\"\nIf I power down the machine, then turn it back on it, it boots up fine.\nInternal hard drive checks out fine.\nI took it to the Apple Store Genius bar, and they could not find anything physically wrong with it, and blamed it on a problem with my user (software), thinking since the OS has been transferred over from several previous machines (an iMac G4 and then a PowerMac G5), that something PowerPC is causing the freeze.\nI've tried doing a verbose mode, but not seeing anything.\nAny ideas on how to further diagnose this and ultimately fix it so I can restart without having to power down and then back on?\n\nA: To further diagnose the problem I would try creating a 2nd user account to log in with, while also disabling any kind of automatic log in if that is enabled for your normal account. This could be used to see if it is something specific to your user account.\nTest to see if the machine can restart from the login window or the other user account.\nIf it does then there is a User account problem occurring, and you can try to manually locate what the problem is by doing manual house cleaning tasks.\nIf the problem still persists I would try seeing if when you boot your mac into Safe Mode and see if the problem still exists.\n\nTo start up into Safe Mode (to Safe Boot), do this:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Be sure your Mac is shut down.\n  \n*Press the power button.\n  \n*Immediately after you hear the startup tone, hold the Shift key. The Shift key should be held as soon as possible after the startup tone, but not before the tone.\n  \n*Release the Shift key when you see the gray Apple icon and the progress indicator (looks like a spinning gear).\n\nIf it goes away then there is some kind of third party driver, etc that may be causing the issue. See more information on what Safe Mode does to find out where to look to troubleshoot next. \nIf all else fails a very good solution in this case is to backup everything to an external drive, and then do a clean install of OS X. Then you can import just the files you need using Migration Assistant or manually. \n", "Q: Is there a list of menu shortcut icons? For example, see the screenshot below. The menu items have keyboard shortcuts associated with them, but where can I find a list of what keys the icons are referring to?\n\n\nA: Since people will probably end up here searching for some particular key symbols, here's a more complete list of the commonly used ones.\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘: command\n\n*⌥: option\n\n*⌃: control\n\n*⇧: shift\n\n*⇪: caps lock\n\n*←, →, ↑, ↓: arrow keys\n\n*⇥: tab\n\n*⇤: backtab\n\n*↩: return\n\n*⌤: enter\n\n*⌫: delete\n\n*⌧: clear\n\n*⌦: forward delete\n\n*⇞: page up\n\n*⇟: page down\n\n*↖: home\n\n*↘: end\n\n*␣: space\n\n*⎋: escape\n\n*⏏: eject\n\n\nA: Here is the Apple KB article on shortcuts\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US \n\nA: The quickest way to get the entire list is to use Finder's help and search for \"Symbols used in shortcuts\" and refer the to the canonical list of symbols. It's also in the user manual for your mac online and I believe is still shipped with all Macs in the box.\nFinder contains six icons in its menu bar and safari has a couple more which visually represent a key on the standard keyboard from Apple (most of which do not share the same icon when made as a physical key cap).\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder: ⌃ ⌥ ⇧ ⌘ ⎋ ↑\n\n*Safari: adds two more ↓ and ⇥\n\n\nSo the list of common symbols is pretty complete as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Control: ⌃ (also ctrl or ctl) \n\n*Option: ⌥ (also alt or alternate)\n\n*Shift: ⇧\n\n*Command: ⌘ (historically the \"Apple\" key)\n\n*Esc: ⎋\n\n*Up Arrow: ↑\n\n*Down Arrow: ↓\n\n*Tab: ⇥\n\n\nWe also have some references on the \"meta\" side of the site where we talk about how to differentiate between what is printed on the keys and what software draws in the Menu bar (and other places).\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard icons & terminology\n", "Q: App/solution for having alerts for emails I have following case: when something bad happens with services I'm responsible for, I get email to specific email account. And I'd like to get alert about it from my phone.\nBut I don't mean just notification with a single sound. I want the alert to sound until the email is deleted or I actively disable the alert in the phone. This is for the cases when alert is raised in the night, and I just don't wake up after single, even loud, notification sound.\nSo is there any solution or app that would let me define something like this:\n\nWhen there is email in a specified imap account, play a configurable sound, perferably with rising volume, using loudspeaker in the phone. After the sound finishes, wait 30-60 seconds, and repeat the procedure, until the mailbox is empty again or I do something on the phone to silence the alert.\n\n\nA: Apple does not allow 3rd party applications in the iOS App Store to interact in such a way with the default Mail application to make such a feature possible. 3rd party applications run in a sandboxed environment and are strictly prohibited any access to your mails.\nOn the other hand, Apple also does not allow 3rd party mail clients in the App Store, which theoretically could implement such a feature, but will never be accepted after the App review process (unless Apple would choose to change that policy in the future).\nYou could circumvent these limitations by jailbreaking your iPhone. However, even then it is very unlikely you'll find a ready-made solution which works exactly as you described it. You'd probably have to develop such an app yourself, and then install it on your jail-broken iPhone.\nIf you don't want to jailbreak, nor go through the trouble of actually developing such an app yourself, I suggest you go for a different approach. You could for example keep resending the notification by the server until you confirm reception at the server-side.\nI also suggest sending an SMS through an SMS gateway instead of an e-mail. This has the added benefit you can configure a custom tone (and a more attention grabbing one if you will), just for that specific contact number. Also SMS notifications can be configured to repeat every 2 minutes for up to 10 times, so you would only need to resend the SMS every 20 minutes. Finally, this would also work when you don't have a data connection available (for example when roaming), and in case you don't have a push mail account it should reach you faster than an e-mail too.\nYou could also do both SMS and email for yet another fail-safe. I'll leave it up to you on how critical these notifications actually are!\n\nA: Like the man says, \"There's an app for that.\"\nIt requires a paid service. The app is OnPage. It's a pager service that runs via an app on your iPhone. The service is quite reasonable for a pager service and I believe there's a 30 day trial.\nAfter you download the app from the iTunes App Store you register with the OnPage company via the app. Registering gets you an email address like xxxx@onpage.com. Those who want to page you, send an email to that address and there's little way to ignore it.\nI don't work for company but I'm a trauma surgeon and I've been using this app instead of a pager for the past 6 months or so. It works.\n\nA: There might be another app that will work, eNotify. While I haven't tried it there is a lite version you can use to see if it works for you. This is along the think different solution. Send the email to a special email account and get annoying alerts.\n\neNotify provides direct local notification for incoming messages along with custom email alert sounds for different accounts, senders, subjects, and recipient addresses. Easily silence background email noise and stay aware of important message traffic!  In addition, the message sender and subject can be shown via local notice, so you'll always know when your spouse wants you to drop by the store on the way home, without unlocking your phone!\n\n\nA: We use PagerDuty and our iPhones to accomplish alerts similar to what you're after. You can setup your own escalation scheduler for your account in PagerDuty. Ours typically look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Send an email to @mywork.com right away\n\n*After 15 minutes send an SMS to their phone\n\n*After 15 minutes call their phone\n\n*After 15 minutes move to the next person on the escalation list, repeat\n\n*If after it's been escalated through everyone on call, no one has ack'ed the page, SMS everyone in the company (we're a small company)\n\n\nSo far so. The SMS alerts can be customized on your iPhone to be highly annoying. And, of course, you can assign custom ring tones so when they call it's also unique and annoying.\n\nA: You won't be able to do something like this out of the box. Our monitoring solution calls us at night instead as people sleep through alerts. \nIt's available from monitis. http://portal.monitis.com/index.php/products\n\nA: I have been dealing with this dilemma since eNotify 'repeat' has stopped working (iOS 8.1) and it is eating away at my battery. \nHere is what I am doing now:\nMy email server (gmail in this case) is now set to forward my emails to my SMS email address. For Verizon, it is ##########@vtext.com. This forwards the email as a text message to my phone - from me. I have the text tone for this contact (me) set to a loud, annoying ring tone. In Settings, Notifications, Messages: turn on Badge App icon, Show on Lock screen, Alert, and Repeat Alerts 10 times. \nI also have that email account set to be the only Badge App icon (otherwise my personal junk mail account will show 99 daily unread emails.)\nCons: It seems if my phone is not at the lock screen, I get the large Alert box but repeat will not happen unless it is at the Lock screen? Is what Apple intended or a bug? I suppose Apple assumes we all have perfect memories and aren't constantly multitasking. \nPros: If you walk away from your phone or it is in your pocket/purse & locked, you will get the repeat notifications. For this reason, set Lock to 1 minute to optimize. \nWouldn't life be easier if we could just set 'Repeat' on emails?? C'mon Apple. You make me miss my Blackberry.\n", "Q: Discrepancy in iCloud backup sizes After recently deciding to try out iCloud backups on my iPhone 4S and iPad 2 (both on iOS 5.0.1), I ran into a problem that's making it difficult to trust these backups. The \"Latest Backup\" for each device never goes higher than 2.0 GB, while the \"Next Backup Size\" is reported as a higher number — 6.3 GB in the case of my iPhone. This next backup size matches what iCloud generally matches the cloud space reportedly occupied by the iPhone backup. This problem persists no matter how many times I delete and re-back up each device. If I turn off components of the backup (photos, for example, which is the largest item on my iPhone), then the total backup drops below 2 GB and starts to match up. So, questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is anyone else seeing this behavior?\n\n*Does anyone have a \"Latest Backup\" larger than 2 GB, and therefore not seeing this problem? If so, what device and iOS version are you running?\n\n*Has anyone with this problem successfully restored from an iCloud backup? Or unsuccessfully, for that matter?\n\n\nA: This issue appears to have been solved with the iOS 5.1 update.\n", "Q: Mounting a disk as though it were an external disk Here's the setup:\nWe have a corporate Time Capsule (or series of them, rather) with encrypted backups in the server closet.  My Mac currently backs up to that.\nI've just completed encrypting an internal disk using TrueCrypt, and set it up using a .sh executable that launches at login.  For the curious, it reads:\n/Applications/TrueCrypt.app/Contents/MacOS/TrueCrypt --mount -v /dev/rdisk1s2 and rdisk1s2 is an internal disk on my mac, so as long as the password is correctly supplied, it should be available at all times.  So far so good.  When it mounts, it appears to the OS as though it were a .dmg.\nAnd that's where things get hairy: I'd like to make sure my encrypted volume gets backed up to the Time Capsule.  However, because Time Machine doesn't 'like' mounted disk images (apparently because it wants to preserve some vital assumptions regarding the availability of this disk...) it doesn't recognize the disk to back up.\nSo the question at this point is: How does one go about 'tricking' Time Machine into thinking the disk is back-up-able?\nThus the title: How does one go about referencing a mounted disk to make it appear to the OS as though it was internal?\n\nA: It looks like you're not the only person with this question.  As a workaround, could you use FileVault 2 for full-disk encryption instead?  That does play well with Time Machine.\nMore information about why this doesn't work at Backup mounted drive of an image in Time Machine.\n\nA: Normally, you can use hdiutil attach <image>.dmg to mount disk images. It will then appear to OS X as a normal drive, appearing in the Finder and rooted at /Volumes. Not quite sure whether that will work with a TrueCrypt volume though.\n", "Q: Weird errors in system.log while trying to run .kext First, I don't know if this is the correct place to put this question.

How is this possible, I never saved SHSHs before?\n\nA: Here's a helpful guide on using TinyUmbrella, SHSH blobs, and downgrading. Depending on your hardware, downgrading may or may not be possible. I haven't tried downgrading anything since iOS 5 beta on original iPad and iPhone 4. It worked in both cases, but I'm not sure what you have. \nThe version of iTunes may also play a role in your ability to downgrade. For instance, the latest iTunes may not allow you to restore a version of iOS prior to 5.\nSorry if this wasn't as solid an answer you were searching for.

This seems like it might be related to my switch to iTunes Match. My Music App displays the artists out of order. Other lists, like Songs and Albums, are sorted correctly.

I suspect there may not be a way to do this, but I thought I'd check with the experts. Here's the situation:\nThere is a wireless network at my work (Work), and at my home (Home). However, I do some work from home, and so I have an Aruba wireless box that means the Work network is also available in my house in order to give me access to my employer's VPN.\nWhen I'm at work during the day, I use the network Work on my iPhone. When I come home, it will always automatically connect to my VPN enabled Work network at home, rather than my Home network.

I am developing a push notification infrastructure and would like to test it with the iPhone Simulator on a Mac. \nIs this possible, or do I need to use a physical iPhone?\n\nA: Push notifications don't work in the simulator.  You have to use a physical iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad.\nGood luck,\nMark\n\nA: You can test Push Notification using any button Click event.\nFirst of all you have to create dictionary, like below.  \nNSString *StrTemp = @\"{'aps':{'alert':'Test alert','sound':'default'}}\";\nNSData *tempData = [StrTemp dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];\n\nNSDictionary *testNotification = [NSJSONSerialization\n                                  JSONObjectWithData:tempData\n                                  options:0\n                                  error:nil];\n\nAnd you can send notification like below.  \n[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] application:[UIApplication sharedApplication] didReceiveRemoteNotification:testNotification];\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to absolutely force a Log Out, Shut Down, or Restart with open tabs and unsaved documents? I could not find any relatively simple way to log out of a public use Mac quickly with many tabs open and unsaved document in the background without resorting to sudo shutdown -h now.\nThe reason I ask is that sometimes a user will have his/her account logged into the iMacs here at school and they would try to log off and then leave, thinking it has completed but the process is interrupted by Safari and Office apps, leaving their account, mounts, and websites still accessible to the next person who sits down.\nObviously a shortcut string would be nice instead of posting a note telling the person to type arcane things in a terminal. For example, just having them try to find Terminal.app is going to be a chore.\nThis doesn't seem to make sense because the user can just quit each app and click a few dialog boxes but unlike you and I to whom repeatedly pounding Command-Q while hitting the spacebar and D keys are probably second nature.\n\nA: At my college, they had an app in the Dock whose icon was a white square with LOG OUT in big red letters. It ran a script (put together with appify or similar) that killed all running apps and logged the user off. This also helped with people who didn't know the Mac and didn't look in the Apple menu for the logout menu item.\n\nA: You could create an AppleScript application, saved to the Desktop or other prominent location, that says\n  do shell script \"sudo shutdown -h now\" with administrator privileges\n\nThe user double-clicks the shutdown script, gets a dialog box prompting for the password, and if it is correct, the shutdown proceeds. Note that this only works for accounts with administrator privileges.\n\nA: There's also the shortcut Command+Shift+Option+Q to log out without confirmation, but it doesn't help when you have unsaved documents pre-10.7; it just avoids needing to hit Command+Q repeatedly.  However, with Lion's Resume feature, this works as intended - leaving unsaved documents for the next time you log in.\n\nA: You can use a third party program like Power Manager to automatically log out inactive users. Power Manager will quit any running applications and will deal with applications that attempt to block the process with sheets or dialogs.\n\nDisclosure: I work for DssW, the makers of Power Manager.\n\nA: This could easily be accomplished with Automator. On firing up Automator, select \"Application.\" Take the command sudo shutdown -h now and put it into a \"Run Shell Script\" automator action. Save it as an application and stick it in the Dock or right in the middle of the desktop. For added effect, do an image search for an appropriate icon that you could add (using your new application's information window).

They will be sent as attachments to your desired recipient.\n\nA: It sounds like things have changed in Lion - I'm running 10.6.8 - but with threading enabled in Mail.app it's easy.  Select the thread header (which shows the subjects listed in the viewer window below) and press Shift + ⌘ + F. The messages and contents, attachments, etc. are compiled into one new email, ready to be forwarded to a new recipient or group.   \n\n", "Q: Syncing iTunes between 2 accounts on the same computer I have 2 accounts (home and work) on my MacBook, and would like have both accounts accessing the same iTunes library. \nI have some success by putting the iTunes Library in the public folder of my home account, so my work account can access the same files too. However, what I would like is to have my Podcasts sync as well.  So that when I plug in my iPhone, I can sync my Podcast regardless which account I am on.\nAny idea how to do that?\n\nA: It seems this is not entirely possible as per this Apple discussions thread:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1521856?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Virtualizing Mac OS X on Linux - is it legal? While browsing i found an interesting tool in sourceforge.net\nit says\n\nMac-on-Linux is a Linux/PPC program that virtualizes Mac OS or Mac OS X in Linux.\n\nIs it legal In india?\n\nA: On Apple hardware, yes - as of OSX Lion / Lion Server.  Otherwise, no - it's a violation of the EULA.\n\nA: It's a violation if its not on apple hardware. For the record that is for OS X ppc only. It doesn't work with anything recent at all. \n\nA: Thanks i got solution from askubuntu \n\nIt's against the EULA, but in general, each provision of a EULA is\n  treated separately (at least, according to Wikipedia), i.e. so a part\n  of a EULA might be found to be legally non-binding. The legality\n  depends on where you are, but if you're in the US, I would guess it's\n  illegal because of the DMCA. Apple sued a clone manufacturer(Psystar)\n  several years ago for selling machines with OS X installed on them.\n  They sued under several different legal reasons, but one of them was\n  that Apple uses encryption methods protected under the DMCA to keep OS\n  X from being installed on non-Apple hardware. The court found that\n  indeed the DMCA was violated and Apple won.\n  via cs\n\n\nA: It is a violation but it runs so crappy if your using VirtualBox anyway (also no guest additions) that you couldn't do anything worth while in it anyway.\nthere is alot of graphics problems and it makes the OS pretty much unusable.\n", "Q: Does OS X have a setting that will let me apply a Gaussian Blur to the monitor or a specific window? I've seen apps like Isolator which allow one to focus or concentrate on the frontmost window by blurring out the others; I'm looking to do the opposite: blur out the main window (or the entire monitor) and be able to easily toggle it on or off.\nMy goal: using this with digital art software such as Photoshop or Illustrator, to create the \"squint\" effect one does to get a different perspective on how your artwork is progressing. I'd like to be able to toggle this on so I can work in \"squint\" mode for a bit, then toggle it off. Would be great to be able to easily set the blur level as well.\nHoping it can be accessed and toggled via Core Image and AppleScript or similar.\n\nA: Warning: this is a workaround.\nTerminal.app lets you set the exact settings of its window. If you set them correctly, you can get a transparent window with a gaussian blur. If you simply leave a window open in the background in Terminal while doing your work, then bring up Terminal when you want to, this should work great. You can even make the text transparent if you want.\n\n\n", "Q: The iTunes Store has no record of past Audiobook purchases Two or three years ago, I purchased four audio books.

I work in Afghanistan and have limited internet access. I am now in Dubai, UAE on vacation and when I went online to the iTunes store there is nothing in my purchase history. How do I get those books back?\n\nA: I would advise you to take your question directly to the iTunes Store personnel, they are the ones who keep track of user accounts and purchases made.\nYou will want to be able to provide them the billing address and payment method you used for those purchases. Also, if you can find any of the invoices that Apple emails between a few hours to a few days after each purchase - you can also let the Apple Store support person you contact that email in case your Apple ID is different than the email on file.\n", "Q: How do I take a picture of the login screen? I've seen quite a number of login screen screenshots. I've tried Cmd + Shift + 3, but to no avail. How do I take a picture of the login screen or the boot screen of OS X?\n\nA: I have not tested this myself, but maybe this link will help. Grab 'impossible' screenshots\n\nOS X includes a nice command-line screen capture utility named, simply enough, screencapture. While there’s not a ton of documentation on this program, man screencapture will give you the basic options. Once you’ve used ssh to connect to the Mac whose screen you wish to capture, you need to execute the screencapture command with root privileges.\n\n\nA: You can SSH into another Mac and use screencapture in the shell.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable remote login in the sharing preferences on the other computer\n\n*ssh username@other_computers_ip\n\n*sudo screencapture ~/Desktop/screenshot.png\n\nA: Ensure that fast user switching is enabled, then open grab, take a timed-screen, you have 10 seconds to switch to the login window via fast user switching - don't log out!\n\nA: Use your phone to take a photo of the login screen\n\nA: If you don't have a second host to ssh to your Mac or a camera/phone you can use a launch daemon:\nCreate a plist with:\nsudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.screenshot.plist\n\nwith the content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>local.screenshot</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/bin/bash</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/bash</string>\n        <string>-c</string>\n        <string>/usr/sbin/screencapture -T 1 /Users/user/screen1.png ; /usr/sbin/screencapture -T 16 /Users/user/screen16.png</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nLoad the daemon with:\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.screenshot.plist\n\nReplace user in the plist by a real user name or use a different path than /Users/user/.

I have several avi-containers with exactly same type of content, framerate, bitrate and encoding match as they are coming from a camera that splitted the files.\nCurrently I'm using D-Vision but its development stopped and starting with Lion it tends to break the files which then have to be remuxed to fastforward properly.\nDo you have any software recommendations for me? It MUST NOT reencode the streams!  \n\nA: I'm not sure if I get 100% what you want, so correct me if I'm wrong...\nYou can just use QuickTime (7 Pro or X -> I'm not sure about QT X). Just copy/paste the several files in one new window and export to .avi. It takes some time to export them, but you are not re-encoding them... \nEDIT:\nTry downloading this plugin for playing Xvid-files with QuickTime.\n\nA: Often you can just use Terminals.app's cat command to join AVI files without re-encoding.\nTry opening terminal.app, and entering:\n\ncat *path_to_part_one.avi* *path_to_part_two.avi* > *name_for_the_joined file.avi*\n\nYou may also need to rebuild the AVI index, DTBaker has a good tutorial.\n", "Q: Why isn't Alt-Tab working for switching windows of the same app?

After running:\nenv  ; #from with in terminal\n\nI see the following output:\nTERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal  ;#Not sure Terminal.app\nTERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=273     ;#The CFBundleVersion of Terminal.app\nTERM=xterm-color\nSHELL=/bin/bash\n...\n\nAfter trying to put meaning to each of the variables listed I can't really find any definitive sources for what exactly the TERM_PROGRAM and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION variables are used for. Man pages and Apropos are not showing anything explaining it, and Google is not as well. Clearly it is relating to some kind of Apple specific setting in Mac OS X, just not sure what? \n\nA: TERM_PROGRAM is used in /etc/zshrc and /etc/bashrc to run commands that are specific to the terminal program you are using when they open a shell.  By default, macOS supplies /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal and /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal which do some extra work to manage the current working directory and support suspending and resuming the terminal.  If you use another terminal program, you can place a file at /etc/zshrc_$TERM_PROGRAM or /etc/bashrc_$TERM_PROGRAM and it will be executed when your terminal program opens a shell.  You have to ensure that your terminal program sets a value for $TERM_PROGRAM of course.\n\nA: Use Case:\nI use iterm2, Apple_Terminal, and emacs vterm with zsh.\nI put the below code in the theme setting section of  ~/.zshrc to use different zsh theme in each terminal\n          ZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\"\n          if [ \"$TERM_PROGRAM\" = \"Apple_Terminal\" ]; then\n              ZSH_THEME=\"afowler\"\n          elif [ \"$TERM_PROGRAM\" = \"iTerm.app\" ]  &&  [ \"$INSIDE_EMACS\" = \"vterm\" ]; then\n              ZSH_THEME=\"afowler\"\n          else\n              ZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\"\n          fi\n\n\nA: I assume it is just an environment variable that stores your default program that you want to use to bring up a terminal window.  There are several different applications on OS X that give you a Unix-like command prompt.  The default is the Apple-supplied terminal in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app.  If you've installed some other terminal like iTerm or AquaTerm, then this variable is likely set to that particular application, if it is your default.  The name Apple_Terminal must be some internal shortcut to the full /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app path.\nJust like your SHELL variable, this is the default that is used in scripts or other programs, unless it is specified in those programs specifically, whereupon the default gets overwritten.\nEDIT: actually this answer on stack overflow seems to confirm my suspicions.\n", "Q: Warning: \"CSUserAgent wants to access data stored in your keychain.\" For my backups I use an encrypted external hard disk. This hard disk has two partitions (names are: Backup, Private).\nToday, when connecting the backup I was prompted with the following message:\n\n\n*\n\n*What does this mean?\n\n*Why am I prompted by this after connecting the external disk?\n\nAbout the hard disk\n\n*\n\n*The hard disk is encrypted using Disk Utility.app.\n\n*Both volumes are Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\n\n*In Disk Utility I can see that the volume Private has no owners enabled while Backup has owners enabled.\n\nBackground\nMaybe the following info helps in answering the question of why I'm prompted with this now. The last time, that I've connected the hard disk, I've done the following:\n\n*\n\n*erase the Backup partition (which required a new password)\n\n\nA: In a nutshell, CSUserAgent is part of the core Mac OS X system where the security is handled. In this case, it seems like an innocent warning and intended ask to make sure you are intending the encrypted backup to be used now.\nYou can verify this by opening up Keychain Access and looking at the item in your keychain. Here is a view of one of my portable hard drives that is encrypted with FileVault.\n\nThe Access Control tab will show you if any apps have been signed and trusted to access this item without further prompting - so unless you have some odd problem, your system is prompting you for the normal and usual tool that reads items from the keychain since you haven't white listed the task that normally does that job.\n\nYou can learn a little about the infrastructure from Apple at the Core Services Layer documentation as well as by using mdfind CSUserAgent from the terminal to locate where this program really lives on your mac. The keychain help and support articles are nice as well for reference.\n\nA: I believe the CSUserAgent is related to Core Storage and the warning is asking you for permission to give that agent access to the password (or encryption key) for your backup drive.\nIt's difficult to be more specific because you don't tell us how your drives are encrypted, what software you're using to do the backups, how the drive was mounted, etc.\nAssuming nothing nefarious is happening here (and, based on the limited information you provide, that would be my assumption) I would open Keychain Access, search for Encrypted Volume Password and make certain that CSUserAgent is listed as an application that always has access.\n", "Q: Configuring keyboard shortcuts I'm using OS X 10.7.2 and there are a couple keyboard shortcuts that are just driving me crazy - how do I change them?\n\n\n*\n\n*In Chrome, \"Go Back\" (or Forward) is ⌘ + [ or ⌘ + ] (for forward), how do I change it to ⌘ + ← or ⌘ + → (for forward)\n\n*In Chrome, search is alt + ⌘ + F .

According to this 2011 review, the app can:\n\nAirPlay is what lets you throw content from an iPad or iPhone\n  wirelessly to speakers or your TV. To do this, you need to have an\n  AirPort Express next to your speakers, or an Apple TV hooked up to\n  your TV. Bluetooth speakers show up in the list, too. What you can’t\n  do is beam movies from your iOS device direct to your big-screen iMac.\nAirServer is a $3 app that adds in this last piece of the puzzle. With\n  it running on your Mac, a new entry will show up in the AirPlay\n  popover of any iOS device on the same network, as you’d expect.\nMusic just appears magically from your Mac’s speakers, or whatever\n  speakers are hooked up to it. Movies open after a second in the\n  Quicktime player, and it’s on-screen controls let you play, pause,\n  scrub and change volume on the Mac itself.\n\nAccording to the link on the AirServer website, the price for the current version (AirServer 4.0) is $14.99.\nAnother application with similar functionality is Banana TV. However, it doesn't support iOS 5, as this note on the app homepage states:\n\nBanana TV has moved to free. We will not be supporting iOS5, although\n  the latest build DOES support Lion. You need an iPhone or iPad running\n  greater than or equal to iOS 4.2 and less than iOS 5.0. We apologize,\n  but keeping up with Apple's continual change of the undocumented,\n  private AirPlay interfaces just isn't something we can continue!\n\nBoth applications allow for media to be played from an iOS device to a networked Mac.\nEDIT: Add current price of AirServer application.\n\nA: How about Airfoil from Rogue Amoeba. It also offers the facility to receive audio from iOS devices and play out through your Mac. See this page for more details.\n\nAirfoil Speakers can now receive audio from several new sources, without even needing to use Airfoil. What does that mean for you?\nFirst and foremost, Airfoil Speakers for Mac can now receive audio from your iOS device! Launch Airfoil Speakers, and it will appear in the list of AirPlay devices on iOS. When you play audio in an app on your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad, you can select Airfoil Speakers from the AirPlay list, and you’ll hear the audio right on your Mac.\n\n\nA: maybe you like this app/audiohost combination : http://midimux.com\n", "Q: What is the Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render environment variable for?

I have recently moved them from a data center, where they sat behind a pair of firewall devices and they had originally been configured for failover between the two machines. At the data center they had fixed IP addresses.\nNow I have the machines set up at home, connected by Ethernet to an Apple Time Capsule that serves as my primary home networking device.\nFinding and removing or disabling all of the legacy settings on these machines has proved daunting. I keep having conflicts that arise when I attempt to install new software and services.\nSo I thought I'd cast about for options and advice.\nI have backups of all critical data these machines hold.\nI primarily use these machines for parallel processing of Mathematica based applications (lots of number crunching). No web services, email, or anything like that.\nCan anyone recommend a way to identify and remove or disable all of the legacy configuration and then set up the servers to to operate in their new simplified environment?\nIf not, do I need to wipe them clean, reinstall OS X, and configure them anew?\nIf so, how long does a reinstall take?\nDo I need anything other than the original installation disks?\n\nA: It's a good idea to reformat the machine, because who knows what all was run on it, and whether that may cause problems for you later or more so now. So it's a very good idea starting off from a clean slate - you will know what is installed, since you installed it.\nIn fact, I would never use a re-purposed machine without formatting it first. It's a security risk not formatting, and I would not want to chance my data etc on it. And since the machine was a server connected to the internet, there's even more reason to reformat it.\nIt will take you much less time to just start over than it would to go through potentially hundreds of thousands of files located on the system that could have been modified intentionally or maliciously.\nA typical install of OS X usually takes less than 1 hour, usually around 35 minutes or so.  Server may take longer, and all you really need to do is get it started which takes less than 5 minutes.\nAdditionally, you would not even need the original install disks, you can install any version of Mac OS X newer than what came with the server originally. Which might not be a bad idea since you are not really needing the features that a server version has to offer, based on what you said your were doing with the systems.  But that really depends on what the Mathematica setup requires.\n\nA: You can even just install the OS onto an external drive and set things up cleanly. If you find you need to boot back to the old configuration, it's just a short interruption. Plan on 15 to 20 minutes for the install. The configuration depends more on your familiarity - I'd spend 30-90 minutes on the first attempt and see where you get in that time.\nDoing the install over is almost always worth the time in my experience. You can document what you have, get back to defaults and avoid having things running that are not required.\nWith 3TB drives so inexpensive, it's inexpensive in time and funds to not just back up the boot images to compressed images and restore onto the boot drives once you have a new image that suits your needs.\n", "Q: How do I restore a previous version of my ssh keypair files? I was following the Github tutorial and I generated a new SSH key pair. But now when I'm online, Google keeps throwing up SSL errors (and so does everywhere else with SSL, for that matter). What terminal commands do I need to input in order to return to my original SSH key pair?\n\nA: Note: I actually think your browser SSL errors are not at all related to the fact that your generated a new keypair for ssh use in your ~/.ssh directory. Browsers don't use these keys, only ssh uses these keys (and things that are based around libssh).\nBut if you want to restore the previous version of your keypair here are the two ways you can do it....\nAssuming you followed step 2 in that github document, you can just restore your backed-up keys:\ncd ~/.ssh\nrm id_rsa*\ncp key_backup/* .\n\nThat will delete the new keys you created and then restore your old keys.\nIf you didn't backup your original keys according to that document you can try to use Time Machine to find the previous version of your keys and restore them.\nFirst open a Finder window and then hit Cmd-Shift-G to bring up the Go To box. In the box type: ~/.ssh and press the Go button.\n\nSwitch to column view so you can see the details of the files in the ~/.ssh directory and note the Date Modified time on the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files.\n\nNow enter Time Machine by clicking on the Time Machine icon in the upper right hand corner of the menu bar and selecting 'Enter Time Machine':\n\nStep backwards in time until you find the point where Date Modified time stamps on those two files change.

Can this be done?\n\n\nA: If you turn hiding on for the Dock, using the + button will extend maximized windows to the very bottom of the screen. When you mouse down near the bottom of the screen the dock will appear and be on top of any program windows on the display.\nIf you turn Dock hiding off after maximizing windows in this fashion they'll stay maximized all the way to the bottom of the screen. The Dock will be on top of the windows.\nAs promised, here's some AppleScript to make this happen:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set the autohide of the dock preferences to true\nend tell\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontApp to first application process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\ntell application (name of frontApp)\n    set zoomed of window 1 to not (zoomed of window 1)\nend tell\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set the autohide of the dock preferences to false\nend tell\n\nYou can follow these directions to assign that script to a keyboard short cut. I put the delays in there because I found every few runs the dock would unhide before the window had maximized and as such, it wouldn't be behind the dock.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro creates soft hissing sound through headphones Recently I got a quite nice pair of in-ear headphones which block noise very well (with a very tight seal, not noise cancellation). Before that, I used Apple earbuds.\nWith these better headphones, I'm now often hearing a hissing noise. This happens constantly while a sound is being played (music, alerts, etc.) and for several seconds after. I assume this was happening with my previous headphones but there wasn't a good enough seal for me to hear it.\nThis doesn't happen with my iPod or iPad. How can I stop it from happening?\n\nA: I have had the same hissing with my MacBook Pro and a pair of Sennheiser CX300-II in-ear headphones. I solved this by changing the output format of the Built-in Output device from  48kHz/2ch-16bit to 48kHz/2ch-32bit.\nThis can be done as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Audio MIDI Setup. Use Spotlight to find it or find the application in your Utilities folder\n\n*Make sure your headphones are plugged in\n\n*Click on `Built-in Output'\n\n*On the right it will say Source: Headphones and format will be 48000.0 Hz / 2ch-16bit\n\n*Click on 2ch-16bit and choose 2ch-32bit from the drop down menu\n\n\nI choose 2ch-32bit, but I've noticed that any other value than 2ch-16bit already eliminates the noise.\nI am still in the process of figuring out why this works, anyone with more understanding of this issue, please feel free to edit my answer accordingly.\n\nA: I had the same buzz noise as questioned. Though, it went away when i unplugged my MacBook from the adapter. The buzz appeared every time i used a specific power socket. Changing the power socket made the noise go away.\n\nA: Unplug from power outlet, \"problem solved\". Noise stopped, although this is a main issue from the power connector from the mac.\nInstead of unplugging you can also plug into a grounded outlet using the appropriate extension cord. This previous question has some useful info on that.\n\nA: Hope this helps some of you, what solved my issue was the following,\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal \n\n*type cd /Library/Preferences/Audio and press Enter type\n\n*ls and press Enter you should see two files: \n\n\ncom.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist\ncom.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist\n\n\n\n*\n\n*type sudo rm com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist and press Enter it will prompt you for your password\n\n*type sudo rm com.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist and press Enter this will delete the audio settings for your OS \n\n*type sudo killall coreaudiod and press Enter that will restart the audio system and all should be working now, at least, it did for me.\n\n\nA: Tough to know for certain, but my money is on an impedance mismatch between the output of the Macbook and your new headset. Or, perhaps more accurately stated, excessively sensitive (low impedance) headphones are revealing flaws in the MacBook audio output circuit.\nCare to share the model of headphones you're now using? My guess is it's a low-impedance model intended for use with portable audio devices.  You can boost the impedance by adding an in-line volume control adaptor like the Shure EA650. You will find other suggestions for solving this problem, including some DIY answers, by searching the forums at Head-Fi.org\nFor more information/background see: Impedance, and how it affects audio equipment by Rod Elliot and Sound On Sound: Understanding Impedance.\n\nAnother possible solution:\nI have M-Audio powered monitors plugged into my MacBook Pro, and plug my Etymotic earplugs into the headphone jack on the monitors for private listening. I haven't noticed any noise problems with this set-up.\n\nA: Thanks to Bart Arondson for tips to solving my own issue. I've posted details in case they're helpful to someone else.\nI'm using a Heil PR40 Mic (Dynamic microphone) with a Mackie VLZ4 mixer, and was disappointed that (after spending a lot on equipment) I had an unacceptable hiss on my audio, regardless of output (headphones, speakers, etc.)\nFollowing Bart's lead to the Audio MIDI Setup I changed the Input from the mixing board. I changed the Format to 24000 Hz, with 1ch-16bit Integer.\nFrequencies below 24000 sounded hollow/aquarium-like, and frequencies above created the hiss/ringing that had been driving me crazy. Also, using the 2ch-16bit and the 1ch-8bit settings were unacceptable. Apologies if I mucked the link to the screenshot!\n![screenshot of Audio MIDI settings] https://www.dropbox.com/s/fmag17do6msqdyx/Screenshot%202014-09-03%2011.20.24.png?dl=0\n\nA: I actualy heard the hiss when music isn’t on using earphones. i have beats pro heaphones. i found that when i disconnect power mag safe from macbook the hiss disapears completely. i guess it is electrical interference. also hear interference when i switch off heater when magsafe is connected. :D\n\nA: If the hissing sound goes away when on battery power, then you may a floating ground when you are plugged in.  More info can be found at https://superuser.com/questions/495517/electric-shock-when-touching-my-networked-installation-behind-ups/495521#495521 \n\nA: UNPLUG THE CHARGING CABLE FROM YOUR POWER PORT!\nThis may sound crazy, but as another User (DOM) has kindly suggested, (and was downvoted for,) this is a Grounding Problem with the Mac itself; not your wires, not the sample rate, not the bit-depth. \nThis solved my (annoying) noise problem. However, I think it may have to do with which outlet I plug my MacBook Pro in to.\nI'm connecting my secondary MacBook Pro (mid-2012) into a Monster Power PRO 2500 Rack Power Center for my studio desk. It's plugged into the front outlet. I'm thinking that's causing my problem. However, it may be caused by any outlet I plug into since I've yet to test any others.\nAnyone else try using different outlets?\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but many still experience this issue and this is the forum that Google detects as a \"top post\" on the topic. \nI have some additional information to add, regarding the \"unplug your power adapter\" and \"it is a grounding issue\" responses.\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, unplugging the power fixes the problem, if you indeed have the \"hiss\" associated with the MacBook power supply.\n\n*It is not entirely a grounding issue. The MacBook \"MagSafe\" power supply is a complicated transformer with extensive digital circuitry. It creates noise. \n\n\nEven if you bought a brand new, $79 MagSafe power supply, the noise would not completely go away. It may diminish significantly, even to the point that you cannot detect it, but it is never going away. It is an unfortunate anomaly of the Apple product lineup, and one that professionals in the recording industry circumvent by simply not using MacBook Pro models when clean-signal listening is mission-critical.\nSorry to be the bearer of the bad news. There is something to be said for improving grounding treatment, though. You'll notice the hissing decreases when you press one hand on the aluminum body of the MacBook Pro, and even moreso when pressing both hands on the MacBook. There are a lot of workarounds for improving the grounding on a MacBook Pro which diminish the hiss drastically. Good luck!\n", "Q: 10.7.3 - Screensaver turns on while I'm in the middle of typing/mouse activity Has anyone seen this?  Let's say I set my screen saver to activate after 5 minutes.  Well I can be typing and using the mouse almost continuously for a period of time (5 minutes?  I'm not exactly sure) and all of the sudden the screen saver turns on.  If I'm in the middle of typing the screen saver then goes away almost instantly but I lose a few key strokes.\nIs there an option I need to set to say don't turn on the screen saver until 5 minutes of inactivity?  Or is this a bug?\n\nA: According to Apple Support:\n\nIf you use a screen saver, it starts automatically after your computer\n  is inactive for a time. You can also choose a shortcut so your\n  screen saver starts when you move the pointer to a corner of the\n  screen.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Desktop & Screen Saver, and then click Screen Saver.\n  \n*Open the Screen Saver pane of Desktop & Screen Saver preferences\n  \n*Click Hot Corners. Choose Start Screen Saver or Disable Screen Saver from the pop-up menu for a corner you want to use; and\n  then click OK. To use the Command (⌘), Control\n  (^), Option (⌥), or Shift (⇧) key\n  together with a hot corner, press the key while the pop-up menu is\n  open. For example, if you press the Shift key, the Start Screen Saver\n  command changes to ⇧-Start Screen Saver.\nTo deactivate the screen saver and return to the desktop, press any\n  key or move the mouse.\n\nAdditional screensaver configuration options for Lion are listed in this Apple Support KB.\nThis issue could definitely be a bug, but you could also check your screensaver configuration to determine whether you've turned on hot corners - it's possible that your mouse pointer may have triggered the screensaver. You can also choose to disable screensavers completely to avoid this issue.\n\nA: I am having the same issue so can confirm it is a bug. I've disabled my hot corners just to make sure I'm not accidentally hitting them. I had my screensaver set to 30 mins, and it seems to happen every 30 mins.  So it seems that the computer thinks I'm away, even though I'm using it. This is reproducable by dragging the slider from 30 mins to 5 mins, the screensaver comes on automatically before I even release the mouse (from sliding the setting from 30 mins to 5 mins)\nThis is one strange bug. \n", "Q: Which iOS presentation/slideshow app can be controlled by a Trust Wireless bluetooth remote I want to use my iPhone (4S) with the VGA adapter to display presentations on a beamer (projector) and control the advancement with a Trust Wireless Remote Control for iPad.\nThe remote works well with music apps (iPod/Music, Rhapsody) and also in slideshow mode of the \"Photos\" app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unfortunately iOS does not (yet) support QuickTime movies with manual advance - which would be my favorite option.\n\n*Keynote for iOS unfortunately doesn't support generic bluetooth remotes (yet).\n\n\nThe best solution I've found so far is to use the \"Photos\" app and start a slideshow (of a group of images), which then can be controlled by the bluetooth remote.\nIs there any app for presentations with the VGA adapter that supports bluetooth remotes?\nAs I have my iPhone with me anyway, I want to use as little (and least expensive) additional hardware as possible to give a presentation using a beamer with VGA input: the VGA out adapter and the bluetooth remote are working with my iPhone - I'm only missing a decent presentation app that supports both.\nI would prefer a non-jailbreak solution that is likely to be compatible with new devices/iOS versions.\n\nA: As of March 2012 there doesn't seem to be a real presenter app for the iPhone, which supports the Trust Wireless Remote Control (or generic bluetooth remotes, that do work with music apps) and offers VGA-out. \nI really hoped I didn't search thoroughly enough but it seems such an app has yet to be made - and I bet it would sell well.\nSo, if anyone happens to find such an app for the iPhone or something that supports QuickTime movies with manual advance: please post it here and I'm gonna reward a bounty of ≥150 points.\nThe best way to go till then: Use a collection of pictures in slideshow mode of the \"Photos\" app (supports both VGA-out and bluetooth remotes)\n\nA: Although it works with your music, your Bluetooth remote is only supported with the iPad 1 and 2. While similar, Keynote for iPad iOS 5.0.1 DOES support Bluetooth remotes. \nAn alternative would be to use another iOS 5.0.1 device (iPhone, iPad) and use Keynote Remote over WiFi or Bluetooth. WiFi is easy, Bluetooth is missing a bit of information.\nFor Bluetooth, create a Bluetooth personal hotspot and pair the devices together. Then Keynote and Keynote Remote work fine. You set up the personal hotspot by going to the Bluetooth settings on both devices and they search for each other, etc. – it's pretty clear.\n\nA: (Read my edit first...)\nApparently, when your update your iPhone 4S to 5.1, you can reconnect with your  Bluetooth device...\nThey say:\n\nAs discussed in the comments below, Apple broke the Bluetooth\n  connectivity in Keynote in iOS 5.0 and 5.0.1 [...]\n  The good news is that they fixed it again in iOS 5.1\n\nI hope this helps for you!\nEDIT:\nNevermind, they are talking about Keynote Remote and using Keynote between an iPhone and an iPad.

If you have more than one app, turn on Badges or Banners (temporarily) until you get the next notification. The app with the new badge should be the culprit.\nOtherwise, go through the list one by one and disallow Sounds for each app successively until you find the offending app.\n", "Q: Is it possible to share a keyboard physically connected to a Windows 7 PC with an iPad 2? I have an iPad 2 and a Windows 7 notebook.\nIs it possible to, without jailbreaking, share the notebook keyboard with the iPad?\nMaybe some application installed on Windows could expose keyboard through Bluetooth?\n\nA: The JUC400 Wormhole switch will do this.  There are a number of other solutions mentioned at How can a keyboard be shared with an iPad?.\n", "Q: problem with messages I got a message from my bf on my iphone and could reply as normal, but when I sent a picture, a new thread was added in my inbox. The same thing happened when I deleted both of the threads and wrote a new message. The one I sent was there and when he replied, another thread was suddenly in the inbox. Why does this happen?\n\nA: When you open your Pictures app, select the picture you would like to send, and then select send in an email, it doesn't know that it \"should\" be part of the previous thread. It is a new email. If it was added to the thread, then technically, any email that you send to him should part of the same thread. Unfortunately, even if you type the same Subject in as the thread, it will still not show in that thread.\n", "Q: Xserve display problems during installation I've had to reinstalled OS X Server on 2 Xserve machines. The first went fine. See this link for some background.\nWhen I went to the second machine, everything seemed to go OK. As it takes 30 minutes or so for the installation to copy and install files, I got that far and went out to run a few errands while it finished. When I got back, the display had gone black.\nI have a mini DisplayPort cable from the server to an iMac. Pressing Command ⌘+F2 switches between the iMac's display and the attached server.  \nThis worked fine all the way through the reinstallation on the 1st server and fine with the second until I got back from my errands. I've also tested the iMac with the first server; it works fine, so no problem with the iMac or switching it to show the display of another machine.\nHaving just done the install, but not the setup, yikes! What do I do now? The machine hasn't shown up on the network yet, I may have not connected to the network yet.\nShould I just shut it down and restart it?\nCan I do a controlled shut down from the attached keyboard with some key sequence or combination (again with now view of what's going on)?\nSeems like I have either:\n\n\n*\n\n*a mini DisplayPort cable that suddenly went bad; \n\n*a mini DisplayPort on the Xserve that suddenly went bad;\n\n*or some kind a controller glitch or failure.\n\n\nI can only get to the mini DisplayPort cable if I shut down the servers and roll out their cabinet (I have well ventilated but tight quarters).\nSeems like I have to restart.

It worked seamlessly the second time around.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 17\" (A1297) - Keyboard backlight dimmer than when first purchased My keyboard backlight is fairly dim. You can definitely see a bit of light through the keys, so it's functional, but it's uniformly more dim than it was when I first bought it and definitely more dim than my 13\" 2011 MBP keyboard backlight. Any ideas?\n\nA: White LEDs, as used in the keyboard backlights in apple laptops, do dim over time.\nWhite LEDs use a blue LED, and an phosphor which is excited by the blue light, and re-radiates the energy in the orange-yellow spectrum. Unfortunately the phosphor does decay over time, reducing the efficiency of the LEDs.\nHowever, the lifetime of modern LEDs is typically something in the range of ~50,000-100,000 hours to 50% brightness, so it's likely that there is some other mechanism in play for your situation. There are a number of external factors that can effect LED brightness, from poor-quality phosphors to overdriving of the LED die.\nCan you estimate the brightness difference? If it's only a few percent different, it may just be normal aging, or lot-to-lot LED variance. \nAnyways, if it bothers you, it may be covered under the apple-care warranty. It might be useful to take it to an apple-store and have them look it over.\n\nHere is an interesting white-paper on LED life expectancy and ageing effects.\n", "Q: ios and mediaserverd I just read about playing media files via the browser, which in turn uses mediaserverd in iOS. Is there any place(a wiki perhaps) where I could find details about which file formats are supported by mediaserverd across various ios versions? The iOS version I'm particularly interested in, is 5.0.1, so any information would be appreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: The mediaserverd daemon/process handles almost all (audio and video) media in iOS, so to answer your question, there is a long list of supported media formats/types for iOS 5.0.1 on Apple's website: http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html. There haven't been any significant changes to this list since iPhoneOS 3. Mediaserverd mostly encodes/decodes media, so the player may differ, but the core process does not.\n", "Q: What's is new in Mail app in Lion compared to Mail app in Leopard Snow? I find Mail app (in Leopard Snow) very limited for my needs. I need something like Thunderbird but before switching I just like to know what's is new in Mail app in Lion compared to Mail app in Leopard Snow.\nIs it really any better?\n\nA: The Apple Web site on Mail in Lion summarizes the most important new features. If it's \"really any better\" or not, depends entirely on your personal taste: I do like Mail.app's new list view where the list appears as a side bar, with chunks of message text in addition to the subject/sender information. You can further unclutter the interface by hiding the Mailboxes tree when you don't need it.\nThe search feature has also got better: things that used to require \"Smart Mailboxes\" (multi-condition filters) you can now do with a quick search in the search bar. Apple also seems to have stolen some good ideas from Google Mail – like Thread view, which is activated in Mail for Lion by default, and groups together messages that belong to the same thread. A thread shows up only once in the message list, showing the number of messages. It's very convenient to move/delete a whole thread in this way.\nAlso a neat feature copied from Google: the quoted text of original emails in replies is hidden by default, but you can unfold it by clicking \"show more\" (with a nice visual effect of unfolding paper). \nHowever, if you love Thunderbird's special features, Mail.app is probably not for you. It's missing the Thunderbird's superb Tabs feature, i.e. you can only view one email folder / search result at a time (this might actually bring me to consider switching to Thunderbird again).\nPersonally, I like Mail.app because it's much better integrated with the other OS X apps I use, such as Address Book, iCal and iChat. Example: I get an email from a colleague, and if she's currently online in GoogleTalk/Jabber or Bonjour (local network chat), a green dot appears next to her name directly in Mail. Can't have that with Thunderbird... Other example: dates, times, addresses and phone numbers are recognized automatically in email text and can be added in one click as iCal event or to complete an Address Book entry. Also, I'm not sure whether Thunderbird's email database is indexed and searchable with Spotlight. Wouldn't want to miss this feature: searching for an email by subject or even message text without opening Mail in the first place.\n\nA: It now has a setting to configure which headers to display. The only step towards professionalism in Lion:\n\n", "Q: How to exclude mailboxes within a smart mailbox? I have made some smart mailboxes in Mail.app. The smart mailboxes I am using only for my Gmail account.\nWhile they send the emails to the smart mailbox they always send duplicates. The email from the Gmail account, email from the whole inbox and email labeled 'important'. Apparently every single email I get is labelled as 'important'. Whenever the mailboxes refresh, they add the duplicates back to the smart mailbox.\nI only want one copy to appear in the mailbox. Is there a way to exclude these duplicates or am I just stuck with it?\n\nA: Well, in Mail 4.5 (on Snow Leopard) it's easy: add a condition \"Message is in Mailbox\" to your smart mailbox's filter. In my case, that \"Gmail\" mailbox is a sub-box of the (unified) Inbox.\n\n", "Q: Quartz Composer in MacOS X 10.7.3 How do I install Quartz Composer in Mac OS X Lion? \n\nA: According to Xcode 4.3 release notes, Apple restructured Xcode — what gets installed (and where) has changed.\nFrom Apple's documentation:\n\nSeveral additional tools are no longer part of the default Xcode installation, they are now downloadable as separate packages. The More Developer Tools menu command (Figure 5) provides a direct jump to developer.apple.com/downloads in Safari where these development tools can be found.\n\n\nOnce you open that and log in with your Apple ID, then download and install \"Graphics Tools for Xcode - ...\", which includes Quartz Composer.\n", "Q: Is there a way to limit Mail to only keep the last 50 mails?

Trying to save some HDD space, as I used to have a few gigs of mail stored in /library/mail \nUsing OS X Lion.\nThanks.\n\nA: Mail can do something sorta like what you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail > Preferences \n\n*Accounts tab \n\n*Mailbox Behaviors tab \n\n*Trash section\n\n\nOn the line that says \"Permanently erase deleted messages when\", you can select one month old or one week or even one day.  That will help get rid of old email and save you some space.\n\nA: Since Mail does not have a predefined filter (in Smart Mailboxes) to get the 50 last received messages, I can imagine you could achieve something like this in an AppleScript.\nThe AppleScript should:\n\n\n*\n\n*get every message in Inbox\n\n*sort the list by date\n\n*select all but the most recent 50 ones\n\n*delete selected\n\n\nThen, create a Mail rule that will be triggered whenever a new email arrives (e.g. you could trigger it on the condition that Recipient contains an \"@\" or that Sender is not empty), and have the rule execute your AppleScript.\nTo get you started on how to write an AppleScript that processes Mail messages, see the script you can find in: /Library/Scripts/Mail Scripts/Rule Actions/Sample Rule Action Script.scpt\n", "Q: When resuming from hibernate, weird garbage on screen For some reason, when returning from an hibernate after i.e. battery drops to 0%, I get this:\n\nMind that this only happens with a few programs, and reopening them works most of the time, and a full reboot fully solves the issue.\nIt's a Early 2011 Macbook Pro 13'' (Base model), with RAM upgraded to 8GB 1867mhz and 128GB SSD, running Lion 10.7.3.\nEdit:\n~ ‹›  $ pmset -g\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1*\nAC Power        -1\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelay   4200\n standby    0\n halfdim    1\n sms        0\n panicrestart   157680000\n hibernatefile  /var/vm/sleepimage\n disksleep  0\n sleep      10\n hibernatemode  0\n ttyskeepawake  1\n displaysleep   2\n acwake     0\n lidwake    0\n~ ‹›  $ \n\n\nA: By default, the MacBook actually copies its RAM to disk any time it enters sleep mode (called Safe Sleep).  You'll notice this because when you close the lid on your MacBook, there will be a few seconds before the light on the front starts flashing.  When the battery gets to 0%, all the computer needs to do is power-off, since the RAM state has already been saved.\nThis makes me wonder if the problem is happening anytime you return from sleep, or only when the battery hits 0%.   \nI had similar issues on my MacBook, where the laptop wouldn't return properly from sleep mode.  These have gone away for me since disabling hibernate and disabling lid wake.\nMany people with SSD disks choose to disable hibernate as the process of Safe Sleep causes a lot of extra writing to the disk (and SSDs have a limited writable lifespan).  Since you've upgraded to 8 GB, the laptop is writing 8 GB to disk each time you close the lid.\nNote that disabling hibernate will also let your laptop enter sleep mode instantly when you close the lid (something I really like).  You'll also recover 8 GB from the sleepimage file, which is pretty valuable on a 128 GB drive.\nThe only concern is that disabling hibernate will be a problem for you if you actually do hit 0% battery frequently.  In this case, it will be as if the laptop had been powered off (crashed).  That's not the end of the world, but you will lose any unsaved documents you may have been working on.  The solution:  don't let your laptop get to 0% battery and shutdown the MacBook when you know it will be off for an extended period of time.\nDisabling lid wake prevents the laptop from returning from sleep until you hit any key.  I believe this is what actually solved my display issues, but I'm not sure since I did both.\nIn any case, here's what I suggest for people with an SSD:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\nsudo pmset -a disksleep 0\nsudo pmset -a lidwake 0\nsudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\n\nConfirm the settings with sudo pmset -g.\nYou can find more tips to optimize your MacBook for your SSD here:  http://sysadmin.flakshack.com/post/9253439680/ssd-tweaks-for-mac-os-x\n\nA: I don't have any definite answer, but only the following hypothesis.\nHere is the information we know:\n\n\n*\n\n*When hibernating, all the information in RAM is copied to the disk, and copied back from it when waking up.\n\n*Your machine has a graphics card that uses the main memory as its RAM.\n\n*The artifacts you show are a sign of graphics data corruption.\n\n*Computers that don't have shared memory don't have such corruption problems, and don't store their GPU-dedicated RAM to the disk (as the size of the sleepimage disk image containing the data clearly shows).\n\n\nFrom this, here is my hypothesis: graphics data is supposed to be reconstructed on wakeup, but is not in your case because the graphics card believes it already has fresh data, since its RAM cache is populated. Only some applications have a problem because they don't require an explicit cache flushing upon wakeup.\n\nA: This is a long-shot, but try resetting your PRAM: reboot while holding down command-option-P-R and hold those four keys down until it reboots again.\nBelieve it or not, some of the old PRAM settings are still used, particularly for display configuration.  Again, its a long-shot, a bug in Apple's display drivers is more likely, but its an easy thing to try.\n\nA: perhaps the following gives a hint?\nI do get similar graphical mess whenever I went to standby (and very likely hibernate afterwards) after finishing a presentation; my conclusions are:\n- is related to powerpoint (but perhaps not only; not sure about that)\n- is related to having a different screen size before/after standby.\nnot sure how it goes away; perhaps waiting a bit or minimizing/resizing powerpoint.\nNB: no SSD in my machine, I have a 15\" MBP early 2011; which has a separate GPU.\ncheers,\nLodewijk Bergmans\n\nA: Do not waste any more time. Take it to an authorized Apple repair center and have them test it.

When I'm working on MS Office 2011, when I close a document, spreadsheet, presentation, etc., the application stays open. This is confusing (to me anyway) and I find myself having to explicitly quit these apps all the time (to get them out of the way).\nIs there a way to quit an app when the last item is closed?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: It's an implementation detail that the developer has to implement. In your example case, for Office, it's Microsoft. \nHere is the Cocoa Objective-C code that allows the developer to implement this feature:\n- (BOOL)applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed:(NSApplication *)sender\n{\n   return YES;\n}\n\nWhat you're observing is normal behavior on almost all applications on OS X and even the classic Mac OS. It's one of those things you should get used to on the Mac. However, these days, you are in luck that things are changing in your favor in Lion and probably later as OS X gains more features from iOS. As referenced in Lion Is a Quitter.\n\n\nLion will quit your running applications behind your back if it decides it needs the resources, and if you don’t appear to be using them. The heuristic for determining whether an application is “in use” is very conservative: it must not be the active application, it must have no visible, non-minimized windows — and, of course, it must explicitly support Automatic Termination.\n\n\nClearly, it looks like that version of Microsoft Office does not support Automatic Termination yet, but it may be coming.\nSo for now, the most you can do is check the program's preferences for options relating to quitting the application when it has no more windows open. Also, I encourage you to give Microsoft and / or any developer of apps feedback that you would like to see \"quitting on last window closed\" as a preference option or suggest they add support for Automatic Termination to their products.\nUntil then, just remember to use ⌘+Q when you are done with those applications that do not automatically quit when you close all its windows.\n\nA: I don't think that's a way for that. You can use Command + Q to quit the program, or click on the name of the app on the Menubar and select Quit.\n\nA: When I started using a Mac, I found that too. Some applications quit after the last window is closed and some (most, in my experience) don't. \nDoesn't really answer your question, but I just got used to using ⌘ + Q which will quit the application. That way if you have any open, unsaved documents it will prompt you to save them, then quit.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro WiFi keeps shutting down for no apparent reason I've got quite a problem with my Macbook Pro (late 2010, running OS X Lion 10.7.3).\nSince a few days ago, my wifi frequently keeps shutting down.

I took it into the Apple support people on campus and, after running quite a few tests, they found out that the cable connecting the AirPort card to the motherboard had gone bad. It sounds like this is the same thing that you're experiencing, so your best bet is to see about getting that cable replaced.\n", "Q: Good PostScript viewer for MacOS? On OS X, is there a good application to open PS files without converting them to PDF?\nIn addition, I want to associate PS.GZ files to this application, but retain the TAR.GZ association to my uncompressor. Is this feasible?\n\nA: There are several possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preview.app (comes with OS X) will open any PS (PostScript) file. In the background, I assume, a conversion to PDF takes place, but this should not be an issue.\n\n*Adobe Illustrator can open and edit PostScript files. Shelling out a rather big amount of money for just viewing a PS file seems overkill, though. However, there is a free 30-day-trial (link from January 2013 for CS6).\n\n*PostView by Metaobject is said to support PostScript as well, but I personally am not convinced / could not get it to work.\nMy personal recommendation: Use Preview.app!\n\nA: To answer your first question:\nNo need to download anything to open the *.ps file without converting just open your terminal.\nopen -a textedit filename.ps\nIt will open a *.ps file like Ultraedit.\n\nA: Problem:  I recently encountered this problem and found Preview.app was unable to open a *.ps file.\nSolution:  Changing the extension to *.eps allowed the files to be opened automatically (i.e. double-clicking on the *.eps file converted the file to PDF and opened it in Preview.app).\nCaveat:  However, YMMV.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Remote Desktop to control a Mac Lion Server without monitor and keyboard attached? I never used Remote Desktop for Mac OSX so before buying the software I would like to know if I can fully control my Mac Mini with Lion Server installed without any keyboard or monitor attached.\nBasically I would like from my Mac Book Air to use Remote Desktop to see the graphical environment of my Mac Mini server and control it, without a KVM.\nWhat I'm concerned, and I didn't find any clue inside Apple website, is the fact that when I'm trying from my MacBook Air to open a Remote Desktop session on my MacMini server some sort of acknowledge is required to the person at the console of that machine, but in my case that machine would be fully unattended and without any keyboard and display.\nSo I'm asking this question to someone that succeeded in using this software (or other software, any suggestion is welcome!) in this configuration.\nFinally, the software admin guide says: \"Apple Remote Desktop replaces the need for KVM (keyboard-video-mouse) switches for accessing Xserve computers without a monitor attached.\". So it's ok for XServe, but what about MacMini?\nthank you\n\nA: There's two parts to your question, one part is easy to answer: yes, you can get a remote, graphical session on your server without the server having to have a keyboard or mouse attached to it.\nThis part of your question troubles me:\n\nbefore buying the software\n\nWhat software are you buying? Everything you need to remotely control your Lion server is included in OS X. From any OS X machine you can connect to any other OS X machine and get a desktop session on that machine.\nTo enable desktop access on a machine go to System Preferences -> Sharing and make sure the Screen Sharing setting is checked. You can configure just exactly who has remote access to the machine from this dialog as well:\n\nWith your screen shared on your server, from your Macbook you can open a Finder window and connect to the machine from there. First click on the machine name on the left bar in the Finder window and then click on the 'Share Screen' button on the top of the window to connect to the machine's display:\n\nDepending on how you set up screen sharing you may be prompted to enter your user name and password.\nThe end result is a Apple Screen Sharing view of your remote machine's desktop:\n\n(The computer you see up there is an iMac with no keyboard or mouse connected to it)\nI recommend the neat ScreenShareMenulet program if you want quick access to screen shares. It sits in your menu bar and gives you one click access to remote screen shares with machines on your network.\n\nA: About the only reason to buy Remote Desktop is if you want to monitor several machines at once - such as a score of servers or employees' workflows. For that it's great, but for straight occasional access, the built in screen sharing is enough.\n\nA: Mac OS X Server is designed for remote \"headless\" administration and even initial setup.  Server Admin included with the Server Admin Tools provides a GUI interface for server administration tasks as well as the ability to screen share the server desktop remotely.\nApple provides a guide: Lion Server: Setting up a remote server.\n", "Q: Can Spaces be configured by project, rather than by application? Spaces seems to give you a choice of having a given software application open in a single space or in all spaces. Is there a way to configure Spaces to so that each space is devoted to a particular project, regardless of what applications you happen to be using for that project? \nFor example, in Space 1 I might have Word files, Excel spreadsheets and a browser window devoted Project A. In Space 2 I might have a separate set of Word files, Excel spreadsheets, and a browser window devoted to Project B, etc. That way I can switch between projects by simply switching spaces, rather than having my screen cluttered with all of my projects at the same time. \nIf Spaces can't do this, does anyone know of other ways to create this type of functionality in Snow Leopard (or Lion)?\n\nA: What I've done to achieve this is to simply not assign any applications to any special space at all. That way, when opening an application, it opens on the space I'm curently on, letting me organize my work into different projects as I want.\nOn Lion, the organization is kept through reboots, at least for some applications. \nThere is also the utility Moom, which lets you save configurations of different application windows to easily recreate spaces you use often.\n", "Q: cron is failing to run my AppleScript I have the following code in a text file (myfile.applescript):\n#! /usr/bin/osascript\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to quit\n\nI would like Chrome to shut down each night at 9:15PM, so I added the following cron task to crontab:\n15 21 * * * ~/Desktop/myfile.applescript\n\nUnfortunately, the script is not triggering. Any thoughts?\nNOTE: I am aware I can use iCal to resolve this problem. However, I'd prefer to not clutter my calendar with a daily script-triggering event.\n\nA: Cron has be deprecated on modern versions of OS X. Apple's suggestion is to use launchd instead. You will find Lingon to be a useful tool for creating launchd daemons. \nIf you would prefer to use iCal to launch the script, you can create a separate calendar for scripted event(s), and hide it from view. It will function, but your calendar view will not be cluttered.\n\n\nA: Make sure the ~/Desktop/myfile.applescript file is executable. You can only call a script by filename if it has the relevant execute bit.\nConsider the following Terminal session:\n$ ls -laFh sh.sh\n-rw-rw-r--  1 jason  staff   278B Mar  2 10:18 sh.sh\n\n$ ./sh.sh\n-bash: ./sh.sh: Permission denied\n\n$ chmod 764 sh.sh\n\n$ ls -laFh sh.sh\n-rwxrw-r--  1 jason  staff    32B Mar  7 09:40 sh.sh*\n\n$ ./sh.sh \nHello World!\n\nUntil I had execute permissions (denoted with an 'x' in either the 4th, 7th, or 10th slot of the permissions string), I could not run it.\nYou can override it by calling the file with it's particular interpreter:\n$ chmod 664 sh.sh\n\n$ ls -laFh sh.sh\n-rw-rw-r--  1 jason  staff    32B Mar  7 09:40 sh.sh\n\n$ ./sh.sh\n-bash: ./sh.sh: Permission denied\n\n$ sh sh.sh\nHello World!\n\n\nA: I discovered my original script worked. The problem had to do with my cron entry: it wasn't terminated with a carriage return. Once I did that, the applescript triggered properly.\n\nA: Try the following in your script.\n#!/usr/bin/bash\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"Google Chrome\" to quit'\n\nMake sure it's chmod +x and test from CLI.\n", "Q: Is there a way to program iTunes to only play all of your songs once? I'm tried of hearing the same songs over and over when listening to songs via  iTunes DJ.\n\nA: This can easily be accomplished with smart playlists.\nMake a smart playlist where the play count is less than one.\n\nThen base iTunes DJ on that playlist.\n\nYou could also select all the songs (no matter what play count and simply add them to a normal playlist and have that playlist not shuffle, but play counts are more durable across launches of the iTunes app.)\nAnd, there's no reason you can't make a second iTunes library just for this purpose. Be sure to not import or organize the tracks and have this second library file just reference the main library. Play through one time and the play counts will all be 1 in this \"special\" library - not the main library. Change the less than 1 to 2 - and you get the second pass of all the songs on DJ.\nAlso - there is a nice writeup in MacWorld explaining how to use this sort of smart playlist for listing to audio book chapters.\n\nA: Yes, and no programming is necessary, just select music under library.\nThen click the repeat button to repeat the whole library playing each song just once. For more information see iTunes Play, shuffle, or repeat songs.\n\n", "Q: Option + click in iTerm In Terminal, Option + click allows me to place my cursor at any point on the current line-- great for editing really long commands.\nHow can I do this in iTerm2?\nUpdate: According to this page, the feature has been around since 0.7.0 (2003). I've also noticed that if I hold Command+Option, the cursor changes into the familiar cross like in Terminal...  but clicking still does not reposition my cursor.\n\nA: I was wondering \"How Hard Can It Be(c)\" to implement it and gave it a go today.\nThe Terminal.app seems to emulate 'move cursor to left/right' ESC sequences. You'll hear the famous 'beep' if you try to place the cursor in the shell prompt. And you'll hear it as many times as there are invalid moves.\nThe solution in iTerm2 works the same by invoking the appropriate ESC sequences. Although it beeps only once if you try to place the cursor in an invalid area ;)\nTerminal.app seems not to be able to handle multi-line prompts, only moving on the last line seems to work. Multi-line prompts in this implementation should be handled correct.\nResults can be found on github. It's a fork of the original with a pending pull request. The branch I work on is named 'option-click-hardcoded'.\nAnd of course it's highly untested. That means tested only by me on my late-2007 MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.7.3.\nIf you'd like try it out by compiling it yourself or download the precompiled binary for i386/x86_64/ppc iTerm_v1.0.0.git-085ec22c.zip).\n\nA: iTerm 2 is not a new version of iTerm - while based on the same source code, there are major changes under the hood.  One of the things that was removed or broken (hard to speak to the developer's intent) was cursor positioning.\nYou're not the only one who noticed this omission; it's been filed as a bug since April 2011 and continues to attract attention.  Your best option for getting this feature (besides forking it on GitHub or switching to another application) is to submit a comment at the Google Code site above.  Hopefully with enough interest, this feature will make it back into the product.\n\nA: The latest builds now include this feature, as of March 15 2012.\nOfficial Download site: http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/downloads/list\nThe latest build (Currently March 26th 2012) includes this feature.\n\nA: This is no longer working in the latest build, you'll have to go back to\nhttps://code.google.com/p/iterm2/downloads/detail?name=iTerm2-1_0_0_20120726.zip\nas mentioned in the original ticket that got the feature added:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/iterm2/issues/detail?id=789\n\nA: The latest version of iterm2 (I'm using Build 2.9.20150812-nightly) has this feature, but in order for it to work with multiple lines you have to enable shell integration as described at https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/3638.\nTo install the latest iTerm, I use brew and execute the following:\nbrew tap caskroom/versions && brew cask install iterm2-nightly\n\nA: My answer is tested in 2019 with iTerm2. \nGo to Settings > Profiles, select the desired profile (can be the Default one, you'll have to repeat this for each one), select the \"Keys\" tab, and change the behavior of the LEFT and RIGHT Option (alt) keys to Esc +\n\nThis is actually in their FAQ:\n\nQ: How do I make the option/alt key act like Meta or send escape\n  codes? A: Go to Preferences > Profiles tab. Select your profile on the\n  left, and then open the Keyboard tab. At the bottom is a set of\n  buttons that lets you select the behavior of the Option key. For most\n  users, Esc+ will be the best choice.\n\nBONUS\nIf you are asking about Option (Alt) + click, I assume you also want your Option (Alt) + Backspace to work. \nIn the same UI (Keys panel), click the button \"Load Preset\" and choose \"Natural Text Editing\". Repeat that for each one of your presets.\nNow you'll have both Option + click and Option + backspace working.\n", "Q: \"Z\" windows position lock I frequently running into strange problem on Lion: my windows constantly being locked on z position (sometimes you can see this feature in some apps as \"Window->Stay in Front/Behind\"). But I really don't understand why is this happening, windows in this apps haven't such a feature (Preview is example).\nI'm heavily using keyboard shortcuts and suspect that I'm just accidentally triggering some system shortcuts for locking windows.\nAm I right, does such exists? If not, what can be responsible for such a behavior?\n\nA: If you switch applications while you launch an application it can lead to the frontmost window being not the active window. This is a problem I encounter quite often, it also happens when you launch an application and another one spawns a window. I'm unsure if you mean this, but it seems to be normal behavior. Looks like\n\nIn this case, the iTunes window is the frontmost window (recognizable by its buttons drawn colored), while iTerms window is drawn over the iTunes window. iTunes is also the active application as you can see on the menubar.\n", "Q: Apache slow to find localhost -- how can I fix? I'm running XAMPP on my Mac, which is just an Apache and MySQL server running as my local host. When I set it up, I found port 8000 (the default) was already taken (maybe by the Apache that ships inside OS X?) so I just reconfigured the httpd.conf file to tell it to listen on port 8080.\nAnyhow, it all works, and I even have put in some settings in /etc/hosts so I can just type \"mysite.local:8080\" into my browser.\nHere's the ONLY problem: often when going to fetch a page from the local host, my Mac takes a while (1-10 seconds) on the \"sending request\" or \"looking up\" step of retrieving the page, and then finally the page loads and renders. It's actually faster for me to access my production server (that is several states away!)... obviously that's absurd and my local server, all right here on the same machine, should be lightning fast. Any ideas why it's so slow, and how I can fix it?\n\nA: A few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache built into OS X runs on port 80. If XAMPP couldn't start the web server erroring because port 8000 is in use, something is listening on that port already. You did one of the right things in reconfiguring XAMPP's Apache port, the other would be to find what's running on 8000 :).\n\n*You're using the \"Bonjour\" name of your server, in theory. The mysite.local name. But if it's taking more than a second to resolve, then it is obviously browsing out to the internet in order to resolve the name to an address and come back inside.\nIf you know how, you can take the time to investigate your Bonjour settings. If you have Wide-Area Bonjour Browsing configured, but the server on the other end is not (or is no longer), these lookup delays are not completely impractical.\nThe quickest fix to this problem would just be to use localhost:8080 instead of mysite.local:8080, the longer one would be to trace where exactly your DNS lookup is heading too, and determining why a multi-second lookup is occurring.\n", "Q: Primary display randomly changes I'm using a MacBook Pro (Late 2011) connected to two Thunderbolt displays. The displays are chained together, and one Thunderbolt connection is made to the MacBook Pro.\nI prefer to have the left monitor function as the primary display (I want the dock to live on the left). Using the Display System Preference Pane, I can set this configuration with no issues.\nEvery morning, I connect the displays to the MacBook Pro and I disconnect every evening. \nSome days, seemingly at random, the display configuration is changed and the right monitor has the dock and menu bar instead of the left.\nIs there any way to ensure the display configuration remains the same?\n\nA: I suffer the same problem, each morning when I come to the office about 80% of the time my Mac wrongly selects the left most TB display as primary >:@\nGetting tired of going to the settings display every time, I wrote a very simple console App to swap the screens for me: \"ScreenPhant\" (like elephants and memory; dig :-P)\nIt is really too simple, but I have no time now to make it any fancier (like staying resident and monitoring display changes automatically etc.).\nIf you just start it, it will list the displays and serials. Pass the serial of the display you want as primary and it will set it.\nIf you rename the App like \"ScreenPhant_151d050f\" it will use the _[serial] for the primary display so you don't need an extra script to launch it.\nYou can download here: http://www.dialxs.com/dev/ScreenPhant.gz\nSource is available here: http://www.dialxs.com/dev/main.c\n\nA: OSX has to guess which monitor is which, since the EDID info is the same for both (save the serial number, presumably, but OSX doesn't appear to pay attention to that).  It usually tries to set things up to the previous setup by looking at how the devices are attached in the connection tree, however with Thunderbolt the connection tree isn't as simple as it was with displayport and USB.\nYou should be able resolve this by attaching one monitor at a time (ie, unplug the thunderbolt connection for the third monitor, attachthe second, then plug the third back in).  However that's less than ideal, especially since all your apps will go back to the main monitor, rather than how you had them set up previously.\nWhen Apple releases a refresh of the thunderbolt display, attaching one of the old ones and one of the new ones should also resolve the problem - they won't appear to be the \"same\" device, and so OSX will have an easier time keeping track of which is which.\nUntil that happens, another thing you can try is attaching the third one with a thunderbolt extension cable.  It's an active device, and may alter the connection tree enough that OSX will have an easier time keeping track of it.\nIf that doesn't help, your best bet will be to wait until they refresh the thunderbolt display and upgrade only one of them when they do.\n\nA: I narrowed down this race condition thanks to /var/log/displaypolicy/displaypolicyd*.log and to the \"Graphics/Displays\" tab in \"System Information\" and in which order external monitors are listed there. MacOS (Mojave, Catalina 10.15.3,...) could rely on the serial numbers of the monitors seen in the latter to remember the arrangement, but it looks like macOS doesn't care about monitor serial numbers.\nIt's easier to reproduce this issue if you don't use daisy chaining but a dock or direct connections to the mac instead. If you connect the dock to the computer first and then the monitors to the dock second while observing /var/log/displaypolicy/displaypolicyd*.log (.log missing from the Console app for some unknown reason), you'll see macOS labels identical monitors on a first come, first serve basis, ignoring not only serial numbers but also physical connectors.\nDon't get me wrong: macOS shouldn't look at the physical ports either. It should look at the serial numbers: the only thing guaranteed to never change or race or be accidentally swapped by the user.\n\nA: This worked for me, credit to this answer:\nhttps://superuser.com/a/1220526/454133\n\nPlay around with moving the \"top\" bar between screens in the Arrangement window. Assign it to different screens and you will notice it will solve your issue once you find the \"right\" screen.\n\nSo, monkeying with the menu bar in the arrangement settings will reset your displays proper. I even got screenshots.\n\n\nA: The free terminal tool I wrote, displayplacer, allows you to configure the \"white bar\" primary display via scripts/hotkeys.\nConfigure your screens how you like, drag the \"white bar\" to your primary screen in the macOS system settings, and then execute displayplacer list. It will output the command to run to put your screens in their current configuration. The screen with origin:(0,0) is the main display with the \"white bar\". Run this terminal command through a script, Automator, BetterTouchTool, etc.\nThis example makes the left screen the primary monitor. Execute a similar command whenever your machine randomly chooses the wrong primary display.\ndisplayplacer \"id:<leftScreenId> res:1920x1080 scaling:on origin:(0,0) degree:0\" \"id:<rightScreenId> res:1920x1080 scaling:on origin:(1920,0) degree:0\"\nAlso available via Homebrew brew tap jakehilborn/jakehilborn && brew install displayplacer\n\nA: Another simple workaround for this problem: keep your displays powered off, and turn them on in the same order after connecting them to your Mac.\nIf you only have two displays, you only need to power cycle one of them.\n\nA: As shared in the (accepted answer above) the problem lies within multiple same-model monitors having the same EDID. Then the system cannot distinguish between both of them.\nI now have solved the issue and now have different EDID for the same 2 monitor models.\nThe solution is simple: I now connect 1 monitor via DP and one via HDMI.\nBoom - I get 2 different EDIDs now. You can compare the EDIDs using ioreg -l | grep EDID. Also the AlphanumericSerialNumber is different.\nBackground: I have 2 Benq PD3200U connected to a TB4 Dock from Sonnettech. As the dock only has TB4 ports I use Anker HDMI to USB-C and DP to USB-C adapters, both plugged into the dock.\nPreviously I had plugged in 2 HDMI Cables via the mentioned adapters, one in the dock and one directly in the MBP M1P 16\". This lead to switching of primary monitors as described on multiple sites and posts.\nI will report back after a few days if the problem has been finally solved this way!\n", "Q: Problem configuring mongo db to start up using launch agent After installing mongodb using homebrew, and following the information that homebrew provided, I did the following:\nlaunchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongodb.mongod.plist \n\nBut got the following error:\nBug: launchctl.c:2406 (25182):13: (dbfd = open(g_job_overrides_db_path, O_RDONLY | O_EXLOCK | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR)) != -1 \nlaunch_msg(): Socket is not connected\n\nMongodb starts fine in a terminal.\n\nA: It seems like the problem was tmux.

A couple of days ago, I randomly kept getting a popup saying that my disk was almost full. Then I went in and noticed the issue in the image. I ran the repair disk utility and got all my software up to date, to no avail. Haven't found any help on Google. Any ideas?\n\n\nA: Not sure whether you've already found this, but there are a number of other people having the same issue on the Apple Discussion Groups. There seems to be quite a lot of good information in that thread so I recommend reading it through, but the consensus seems to be that its hidden local backups/snapshots that's causing it.\nA few people also used DaisyDisk to find, then delete, hidden space on the hard disk.\n\nA: I've also noticed on my copy of Lion that it lists anything as \"Other\" that it doesn't identify to be part of OSX's categorisations. For example I have 25GB of mkv files in my Movies folder, but OSX only sees as me having 7.46GB of movies...\n\nA: I had a similar issue and finally found the cause of the problem. My mail app had issues connecting to one of my email accounts and I found it was storing all of the error messages (900+ GB worth).\nCheck to see if your having the same problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open finder\n\n*press command, shift, g\n\n*type      ~/Library\n\n*press go\n\n*locate & check the size of your mail folder (mine was 900+ GB!!!)\n\n*delete files\n\n\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Have you tried booting up from the recovery partition and repairing the disk in Disk Utility? That just solved a similar issue I was having.\n\nA: Try this delete unnecessary (old) mobile device backups:\n\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes, go Preferences/Devices and view your device backups\n\n*Delete unneeded copies of device back ups. \n\n\nDepending on the number of iOS upgrades you did in the past this will regain a bunch of GBs.  \n\nA: Could it be that you have a bundle image on this drive that is always mounted? \nAlthough not full these can only be shrunk when unmounted - and therefore it might just keep growing...\n\nA: Try OmniDiskSweeper, to see a hierarchical view of your entire HDD (or partition) based on the files and folders size.\n\nOmniDiskSweeper is really great at what it does: showing you the files on your drive, in descending order by size, and letting you delete them easily!\n\nAnd it’s free.\n\nA: This also can be a temporary situation.\nI've been doing a lot of restoring of Time Machine backups to new machines and for a handful of minutes to a several hours after the restore is done, this tool reports other when in reality a good chunk of space should (and will eventually) be shown to be music, apps and movies.\n\nThe picture above looked very similar to yours when I first checked. Unlike spotlight, which shows indexing progress and will incrementally refine search results as new space and files are indexed, System Information takes a momentary snapshot. If you leave that window open and come back in a day - it won't have changed, but if you quit and re-open it, you should see the categorization completed and a truer representation of space.\nSo, I would also suspect that sometimes the process storing this data could be buggy and a reboot/reinstall/other might be needed to clean things up and re-start the process that determines which file type is using space.\n\nA: I have been manually backing up files from a dying MBP and noticed 49GB+ of images in ~/Library/Container/com.apple.Preview/Data folder. Some of these images were over 2 years old. I'd recommend digging through the folders inside the containers and see what other applications have created copies of your files.\n\nA: I know this is thread is old, but I was experiencing the same problem on my Macbook Pro on El Capitan. Using OmniDiskSweeper was awesome but I found the high quality transcoded media files from Final Cut Pro X were massive, so I did a huge project clean up and it gave me an extra 200gb of free space.\n", "Q: How can I handle ClarisWorks documents on Lion? I've a lot of ancient ClarisWorks documents and I want to upgrade to OS X Lion. Is there a way to have a look at or to print ClarisWorks document on Lion?\n\nA: I recently recovered some ClarisWorks 3.0 documents using a 68k emulator.

(They no longer sell One Click Convert.)\n  However, it'll only convert the word processor files.\n\nThe Panergy product page has a link to a FAQ, which states:\n\nThe cwk file extension is the extension associated with an Office\n  program originally called ClarisWorks and later renamed AppleWorks.\n  This Office program is composed of several modules, word processor,\n  spreadsheet, drawing, painting, presentation and database. The cwk\n  extension is used for all the files regardless of the module that has\n  created them and is also used in both version 5 or version 6 of this\n  program. docXConverter open and converts the cwk word processing\n  files of version 5 or version 6.\n\nSo long as the ClarisWorks documents are version 5 or 6 and are word processing documents, this tool should provide the functionality that you're looking for.\nCaveat: I've never used docXConverter before, but the product description looks promising.\n", "Q: iPad buyer's regret If someone is amazed by the new iPad that Apple announced today, but recently bought an iPad 2 from an Apple Store, is it too late? Could that person return the previous iPad purchase in order to be able to buy the latest and greatest? What options are available for someone with buyers' remorse?\n\nA: If you are past the 14 day Apple return policy you can try asking your credit card company. Some, like American Express, will allow you to return merchandise for a longer period.\n\nA: The general rule is 14 days to return things, but I would just go in and let someone there know your concerns. Also, there often are price reductions which would make your recent purchase less costly if that was something you preferred to have.\n", "Q: Can't resize shrunken boot partition to fill empty space I needed to make room on my Windows 7 partition to install a new program, so I did some searching on how to resize a partition and it told me to shrink the OSX side and then expand the Windows one into the free space from Windows.  \nThat didn't work, so now I have a 245 GB boot partition (my main OSX one), then roughly 10 GB of free space, then a ~61 GB Windows partition.\nI tried to just drag the corner down on the OSX partition and click apply, but all it does is unmount and re-mount Windows 7 without changing anything.\nI don't really care whether I expand the Windows partition into the free space as I originally intended or just re-expand the Lion one into that dead space, but there's about 12 GB of space there that's not doing anything, and I'd like to use it.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: First, try to delete the Bootcamp partition using Boot Camp Assistant.\nI had a similar problem, and Boot Camp Assistant didn't recognize any Bootcamp/Windows partition, but in Disk Utility, the size of total space of my 1 TB HD showed only 850 GB of total space. The other 150 GB (from a failed attempt to create a bootcamp partition) did not show in the Disk Utility or anywhere else.\nThen, quite by accident, I created 2 additional partitions using the Disk Utility.  The total space of the 3 partitions showed as 850 GB. However, I then used the Disk Utility to delete the 2 additional partitions which I had created, and it allowed me to specify a resized single partition of 1 TB.  After I had deleted the 2 additional partitions and resized to a single 1 TB partition, the total available space showed up as 1 TB (or actually, 999.97 GB), which seems as though I recovered all of the unused drive space.  :)\n", "Q: Is there a way to limit external hard-drive random spin-up? I have 2 external USB drives connected to my iMac running 10.7.3.  One is designated completely for Time Machine use and the other I use for data. (Nothing but a bunch of JPGs on that one.) The first spins up once an hour for Time Machine backups, great.  But both of them spin up at random times while I'm doing, well, ordinary stuff, nothing disk-related.  Maybe just switching to another app in the dock, or surfing to a new web page.\nSpin-ups for no clear reason are a bit annoying, but I can accept them as long as I can continue working. But in some cases, the spinning pizza cursor appears, and I'm locked out from doing anything while the cycle completes.  That does not make sense to me.  It's a multi (4) processor, fully multi-tasking system. All I/O should be asynchronous.  Finder/GUI operations should not be affected.  \nAny ideas why these random spin-ups occur?  How to search or instrument MacOS to find out why?  How to limit or stop them?    \nDisconnecting or un-mounting the external disks will work, but is not an acceptable fix. \n\nA: This problem has been happening since January 2010, according to users on this Apple Discussion forum. While no fix has been identified, two potential culprits were identified:\n\n\n*\n\n*Spotlight - one user (loayza) noted:\n\n\n\nI also have the issue (SL 10.6.8). I have an external drive to handle\n  TimeMachine and every time I select \"Open with\" from the contextual\n  menu it wakes it up. It's quite annoying! It seems disabling Spotlight\n  solves the problem...\n\n\n\n*\n\n*iStatPro - one user (jrawl004) noted:\n\n\n\nI found the culprit.  iStatPro.....I have a habit of tracking my\n  system status while editing video and this program does a great job at\n  keeping things up and reportig.  So everytime I made the slightest\n  touch to my iMac or MacMini, it would awake everything so it can\n  report.  I disabled the widget and low and behold, things became\n  extremely quiet quickly.  That problem is solved for now....for me at\n  least.\n\nNo solution was identified when checking Apple Support's KB.\n\nA: The obvious solution is to deselect the \"let idle drives spin down\" and you won't have yielded control of this to the OS.\nThe vast majority of people unmount the drives when this behavior is troublesome, so I'll add that in case someone else has a similar issue, but not as strict a stance on \"Disconnecting or un-mounting the external disks will work, but is not an acceptable fix.\"\nIn your specific case, you could run fs_usage and see if you can correlate which IO pattern and program is initiating the spin up and armed with that information, you could potentially nip the cause in the bud.\n", "Q: Where can I learn more about LTE coverage and build out schedules in the US? I am looking for sites that do a good job of reviewing / documenting current LTE data coverage in the US. Where do the carriers have coverage maps and plans for build out documented? Also, are there any independent sources that measure actual performance and coverage so that we can educate ourselves about the options available for data on the new iPad?\n\nA: Not much in the way of a major community database of real-world speeds, sadly. Here are some other resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verizon's LTE coverage map\n\n*AT&T's HSPA+ coverage map (and overview)\n\n*Overview of all major carriers, and another (older)\n\n*More general information on current/planned deployments\n\n*Verizon coverage map with speed tests - Minneapolis/St. Paul area only.\n\n\nYou might also use the FCC's GIS data to find out more about what towers already exist.  Presumably, they're not going to build new towers for LTE - just add antennae to existing sites.\n", "Q: 2nd Generation Apple TV to get UI/1080p update? Now that the Apple TV has been announced and is available, will Apple be releasing a software update for the 2nd generation Apple TVs? I'd like to know if the new UI will be supported on my ATV and whether or not 1080p support will be made available as a software update or if it is dependent on new hardware/processing.\n\nA: Pretty sure that there are hardware differences allowing support for 1080p, not present in prior gen Apple TVs. So if that is the case, then a software update can't add in that support. We will not know for sure until we can see the spec and a complete teardown of the new Apple TV. We might be in luck for a UI update, though.\nSo according to ars techinca's Hands-on and questions answered: third-gen iPad, third-gen Apple TV\n\nApple TV\nFirst let's start with the Apple TV. The device looks the same as the second-generation device and, in fact, the new interface that Apple touted during the event will also be coming to the second-generation version via software update. The only thing new about the third-gen Apple TV is 1080p capabilities plus a more direct link into iCloud for photo syncing. If all you want is the new and improved interface (which I do like, as an Apple TV fan), you'll be able to get it from Apple on your second-gen device without having to pay anything.\n\nAnd as for hardware changes that's a yes to according to the same article as well.\n\nWe asked whether the third-gen Apple TV had the same A5X processor as that in the new iPad (as was previously rumored), but an Apple spokesperson told us that it has a \"single-core version of the A5\" and it's not the same as what's in the iPad. The CPU is capable of handling 1080p HD video.\n\n", "Q: Will voice dictation work on iPad 2? Will the voice dictation technology built into iOS 5.1 running on the new iPad be made available on the iPad 2? \n\nA: No. I installed iOS 5.1 on a Wifi iPad 2, and opened the notes app. No microphone icon is displayed on the keyboard as shown in the keynote or as one sees on the iPhone 4S. This means that voice dictation is a iPad (3rd Generation) and iPhone 4S only feature. There may be apps that enable something like this in the App Store.\nI can't guess about the lower priced iPad 2 16 GB, but existing iPads do not seem to get this feature with the iOS 5.1 update.\n\nA: It's too bad Apple decided not to include this technology in the iPad 2. I'm dictating this response on Dragon and works just fine. The iPad 2 has ample horsepower to support dictation.\nIt's unfortunate that many perceive the dictation function was excluded for obvious marketing reasons, but the iPhone 4S features advanced noise cancelling and voice clarification hardware not present in the iPad 2.\n\nA: Maybe it needs to be enabled in settings? See here: \nhttp://9to5mac.com/2012/01/09/looks-like-apple-is-working-on-siri-dictation-for-the-ipad-ios-5-1-beta-reveals/\n\nA: I just installed the iOS 5.1 update on my iPad 2, and dictation is not included.\n\nA: It doesn't come bundled with the 5.1 and I don't see any indication it will.  That said I know I downloaded a dragon dictation app a while back for dictation.  I sort of forgot about or was turned off because it uses dragon servers so it needs a network connection to work.  Don't know if the apple model requires this or if the A5X chip is fast enough to handle speech recognition onboard.  Anyway dragon is the only option for existing ipad owners.  It's ok, just make sure you have a network connection or it won't work.\n", "Q: iPod Dock Charge Adapter I have a nice stereo system that can dock and charge an iPod Nano 2nd generation.\nI also have an iPod Touch 4 and a 6th gen Nano (or something).\nThe old docks charge using the firewire pin out and the new ones with the USB power pin out (if I understand correctly).\nmy google-fu is failing to find a dock adapter that will swap the pinout so I can dock my newere nano into the older dock and play and charge. (It plays now but won't charge)\nIs anyone aware of such a product?\n\nA: The Charging Adapter from Scosche should work for you. I used one of these in a car that had a iPod dock for the radio, but used the older Firewire pinout, and therefore would not work well with a newer iPhone. \nThis one looks slightly different than the one I had, but it should be the same thing. Griffin I think also makes a similar product. Its a common problem for car radios, so maybe searching for that will help find similar products. \nUpdate: The Scosche Passport is what we actually have. This worked great connecting a newer nano, iPhone 4 and 4S to a Firewire charging deck.\n", "Q: How could one make an automator script to restore all hidden windows quickly? The question is pretty self explanatory: How can one make an Automator script to restore all hidden windows at the same time?\n\nA: This AppleScript should restore all hidden windows.\nThe first action unhides any hidden programs. The second action restarts the Dock, which has the effect of un-minimizing any windows minimized to the Dock.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set the visible of every process to true\n    do shell script \"killall -HUP Dock\"\nend tell\n\nIf you particularly want an Automator workflow, give it one action: Run AppleScript, and assign this AppleScript.\n", "Q: iPad 2 not updating to iOS 5.1 Please don't scold me because I know I broke the cardinal rule of updating...never shut down in the middle of an update. I was updating to iOS 5.1 over the air on my iPad and after the update downloaded it went to the screen with the white apple and the loading bar. After 15 min nothing had loaded and I force shut it down. Now when I go to try and update it says \"Install Now\" because the download file is still in the iPad, I believe. I tap \"Install Now\" and it says \"Unable to Install Update an error occurred installing iOS 5.1\" every time. I tried installing it through iTunes and it said my iPad 2 was ineligible for this update. My iPad is still working, I can play games and what not, so it's not \"broken\"\nI backed it up to iCloud prior to updating. Do you think I should restore and reload from iCloud or can you think of a way I could somehow update it again from my iPad?\n\nA: If you have it backed up. Restore it from the backup and then perform the update again. Following standard instructions for doing that. \n", "Q: Using iMac (2010) as a display for my PC laptop with with VGA only output (female) I'm trying to figure out how to connect and use my PC laptop having VGA video output (female) to iMac 27 (2010). Found some articles about connecting PCs having miniDisplay port but it's not my case. Is it possible at all?\n\nA: You can with hardware, but it's not going to be cheap.  The main issue is going from analog (VGA) to digital; it's much easier to convert one digital format to another.  One (clunky) solution would be to chain a VGA to DVI scaler ($330) to a DVI to Mini DisplayPort converter ($150).   If you get similar products on eBay, you can get a complete solution for a little under $250.\nA better solution would be with software like ScreenRecycler or one of the recommended alternatives.  This way, you're effectively remotely viewing your screen - with a fast enough computer, this works well.\n\nA: This is not possible, you can only use the iMac 27\" in target display mode with mini display port. \nsee this kb: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924\n", "Q: How to use zsh and bash on iTerm2 at the same time? Zsh is better than bash(obviously), but for some reason, from time to time I have to use bash. I am wondering is there any way for me to use them together without changeing them manually? \nWhat I have in mind is putting them in seperate tabs, I have tried it actually. Using zsh as default, and open another tab using different profile opening bash, though this can work, but all the configurations for bash didn't work.\nSo can anyone help me out here, thanks!\n\nA: If by “all the configurations for bash didn’t work” you mean that customizations made in ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.profile or ~/.login) aren’t taking effect, that’s because bash is being invoked as a non-login shell (it runs ~/.bashrc instead).\nTo make it a login shell, the simplest solution is to add the -l option:\nbash -l\n\nAlternatively, if you want to actually create a login session you can invoke it via the login command. This creates a new login session (as displayed by the who command) and it invokes bash with the name -bash (as displayed by ps) to indicate it’s a login shell (same effect as the -l option):\nlogin -f username bash\n\n", "Q: Modify iPhone restrictions passcode Is there a way to change the restrictions passcode on an iPhone without restoring the phone? I haven't forgotten the passocde; I just want to change it.\n\nA: Erasing the phone in iTunes will remove the restrictions along with everything else.\nPer my comment, you can change the passcode for restrictions under Settings > General > Restrictions \nBy clicking [enable restrictions] it will prompt you for password, you may disable it and then re-enter the passcode.\nReference as well here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2478010?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: From Techtips at salon.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Settings\" menu from your Home screen, and then tap the \"General\" button.\n\n*Select \"Restrictions\" from the General page when it loads to the screen. A page loads prompting you for a passcode.\n\n*Enter the current PIN into the prompt. The iPhone will grant you access to the Restrictions preferences page.\n\n*Tap \"Disable Restrictions\" at the top of the References screen. The passcode prompt appears again.\n\n*Enter the current PIN. iPhone returns you to the Restrictions page.\n\n*Tap the \"Enable Restrictions\" button at the top of the page. Enter a new PIN into the passcode prompt when it appears on your screen. Confirm the PIN in the \"Re-enter Your Restrictions Passcode\" prompt to finalize the change.\n\n\nA: I think you should go on restrictions on setting (general) and enter your current PIN then at the top it says 'disable restrictions' and there it goes!!\n", "Q: Change in specs for the 'new' AppleTV? As of today, with the announcement of 'new iPad' (not iPad 3), they squeaked out the update/new AppleTV.\nDoes anyone have any actual details what changed? As it looks like a very nasty UI update (which I don't plan on updating to as I still have my ATV2 which is jailbroken).\nI looked over the store, and checked specs, but I cannot for the life of me see any difference of the 'new AppleTV' except for the software?\nDid I get it spot on? Is it just a software update? Or is there something hardware wise that I would get by purchasing a new $99 unit?\n\nA: via ars technica (http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2012/03/hands-on-and-questions-answered-third-gen-ipad-third-gen-apple-tv.ars):\nThe device looks the same as the second-generation device and, in fact, the new interface that Apple touted during the event will also be coming to the second-generation version via software update. The only thing new about the third-gen Apple TV is the ability to output 1080p (the second-gen can play 1080p movies but only outputs 720p) plus a more direct link into iCloud for photo syncing. If all you want is the new and improved interface (which I do like, as an Apple TV fan), you'll be able to get it from Apple on your second-gen device without having to pay anything.\nWe asked whether the third-gen Apple TV had the same A5X processor as that in the new iPad (as was previously rumored), but an Apple spokesperson told us that it has a \"single-core version of the A5\" and it's not the same as what's in the iPad. The CPU is capable of handling 1080p HD video. The spokesperson also claimed that users \"only need an 8-10 megabit Internet connection\" in order to take advantage of 1080p movies from iTunes, but speaking as someone with experience with the second-generation Apple TV at a mere 720p, this depends highly upon your individual ISP. (Insert grumbling about Comcast here.)\nAnd despite rumors that Siri would come to the third-generation Apple TV (and continued insistence by some publications), there were no indications that Siri was anywhere on the new Apple TV interface. We are confident in saying that Siri is not currently available on the device, though that could certainly change with a software update.\n\nA: According to AnandTech, there isn't a whole lot different. They main is the single core A5 which will enable 1080p output. \nhttp://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html\n\nA: Decoding 1080p video requires a much more powerful processor than 720p, which means a new hardware chipset (hence the A5 chip).  If you're an A/V buff, the improvement in quality can be a big deal.\nThis  story has some details:\n\nThe reason that the 1080p versions of the iTunes Store videos can be a good deal better without doubling the file size—or worse—can be found in the tech specs of the new AppleTV and the new iPad. The AppleTV now supports H.264 compression for 1920x1080 resolution video at 30 frames per second using High or Main Profile up to level 4.0, the iPad and the iPhone 4S the same up to level 4.1. The profile indicates what kind of decompression algorithms the H.264 decoder has on board—the \"High\" profile obviously has some tricks up its sleeve that the \"Main\" or \"Baseline\" profiles known to previous devices don't support.\n\nNote that codec decoding must be done in hardware, as only the latest desktop/notebook CPU's have enough power to decode HD video in software, and even then it uses most of their processing capacity.\n", "Q: Font gets replaced I'm having the following problem! My fonts get replaced in multiple programs (E.g. twitter, itunes, tweetdeck) It all looks like the screenshot I added below. I don't know how this came all of a sudden and it's really anoying, does anyone know what I can do to solve this problem?\nI tried: rebooting and resolve standard fonts in font-book.\nThanks a lot!\n\n\nA: Get Onyx, go into Cleaning -> Fonts, check all, Execute.\nIf that doesn't work, check your disk for errors.  If it still doesn't work, your fonts are are missing or corrupt - reinstall OS X.\n", "Q: Disadvantages of 32 bit mode I have a Cisco VPN client in OSX 10.6.8, which runs only in 32 bit mode.\nAre there any serious disadvantages of switching to 32 bit mode permanently?\n\nA: Not inherently.  32 bit mode should run fine as long as all your drivers and binaries include a 32-bit version, which is currently the case unless you specifically downloaded 64-bit versions.  It should even use a little less ram.  \nBut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mountain Lion will be 64-bit only, so I don't expect universal binaries to include 32-bit versions forever.\n\n*I have \"slimmed\" all my binaries to delete the 32-bit version.  If you have ever used such space-saving utilities, the slimmed apps won't work.\n\n", "Q: Replace or add graphic card on Macbook Pro Is that possible to replace the existing graphic card of a Macbook Pro (Mid 2010, Mini DisplayPort, GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M) for a graphic card that could support 2 screen output?\nOr else is it possible to add another graphic card in (or outside) the Macbook so that I can use another display.\nWhat I am trying to do is have dual external screen (Macbook Pro docked and closed).\nI have tried DisplayLink USB to DVI adapter but it's really choppy and unusable for me (photo and video editing). I can't even watch a video on it, you can even see the difference when moving the mouse (and I have a i7 quadcore processor -_-). I thought it was an external graphic card, I had no idea that the processor would be doing the job instead (and very poorly).\nFurthermore I don't want to spend $200 or $300 to try the Matrox DualHead2Go and finally consider that the fact that it's one big \"screen\" extended over 2 screens (and not 2 real screen separed) is annoying (i'm really afraid this is would be a pain).\nSo I'm looking for a real solution for Macbook Pro dual external screen.\nChange my graphic card? (I don't even know where the second video output would go...). Or add another graphic card externally? (USB? does that even exist?)\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is not a cheap good or ideal way to do this. \nThe graphics card is a key integrated part of the logic board on the MacBook Pro, there really is no separation of it from it to do an upgrade, short of replacing the entire motherboard, and even then you would be limited to what was available at the time for that generation of MacBook Pro.\nSee that orange highlighted square, thats the NVidia GeForce pictured below:\n \nHonestly, the Matrox route is probably the most affordable workable solution to this problem. \nThis MacBook Pro also lacks an ExpressCard/34 slot or Thunderbolt so you really can't go the route of an external graphics card. And even if you could you would be talking over $500 USD just to get the external PCI express chassis, for example Magma's ExpressBox 1 starts at $829 for just one external PCI Express slot, you would still need to spend another ~ $200 to buy a mac compatible graphics card. \n\nYour last option is to maybe reevaluate if this MacBook Pro is the right machine for your needs. Would a newer model MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt solve this problem, maybe maybe not. If you don't have two Thunderbolt Displays, you are kind of still out of luck hooking up dual displays to even a Thunderbolt MacBook Pro, with out the need for expensive external adapters.  \nWould an iMac, Mac Mini, or Mac Pro better suit your computing needs, complimented with a basic MacBook Air or iPad of some kind for your mobility needs.\n\nA: I'd suggest you sell your current MacBook Pro and buy a recent retina MacBook Pro 15\" with both HDMI and Thunderbolt. In that case you could run not just two but three external monitors. You will have to use active adapters for the Thunderbolt connections.\n\n\nBe sure to close your MacBook Pro to clamshell for much better performance as the built-in Retina display uses lots of GPU cycles.\nIf you buy and sell used, the cost of switching machines should be a lot less than monkeying around with external hardware solutions, let alone the frightening surgery you were considering. Alternatively an excellent silver tower Mac Pro can be had from $400 (2006 model) to $1200 (2009 model). With inexpensive CPU upgrades, you can have an octocore or hex core with capable graphics on board (even multiple cards) for a fraction of the price of a new MacBook Pro. Of course you can't carry the Mac Pro around but in this case you are planning a setup with two large monitors so portability may not be a factor.\n\nA: I have the same model mbp with i5. What you could do is  get a DisplayPort to HDMI converter from a reputed company like belkin for one monitor and a AppleTV and use airplay to display the second screen. BTW better quality USB to VGA/DVI converters will eliminate the lag caused by your current connector, cant vouch for the FPS in your game tho...\n\nA: VillageTronic VTBook - this will work!\n\nA: I know you asked this awhile ago, but I have the same model Macbook Pro and don't experience those problems through my MiniPort to HDMI connection. I connect to a 1080p TV from this laptop all the time to watch video, play games, etc. The only time I've ever experienced the lag you're talking about is when I use my projector, which relies on the DisplayPort to DVI adapter you've been using!\n", "Q: How to make a high-resolution capture in the Preview application on Mac? everyone. I use the Preview Application on Mac to view my PDF/JPEG/PNG files. Generally it works fine. But I've got some troubles with the \"Select Tool\".\nI want to capture a part of a PDF file, like a graph or a chart etc, and insert the captured image into Evernote. That's how I do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scale the PDF file so that the graph/chart looks big enough.\n\n*Command-3 switches to the Select Tool.\n\n*Select the graph/chart.\n\n*Command-C copies the selected part.\n\n*Go to Evernote, Command-V pastes the selected part, inserting it as a JPEG image.\n\n\nWell, the problem is the resolution of the pasted image is so POOR. I don't know who to blame, Preview, or Evernote?\nOne more thing. I try to paste the selected part into PhotoShop. However, Command-V pastes the WHOLE PDF page. It seems that Preview, Evernote and PhotoShop say different dialects when copy/paste something.\nThanks for your help, guys.\n\nA: If you just want to make a quick copy of a graphic inside a PDF for your Evernote, scale it big enough and make a (rectangular selected) screenshot of it (⌘⇧4).\nAs for copying a graphic from PDF into Photoshop: I think it would be a good strategy to save the PDF as TIFF (selecting a high enough resolution in the export dialog) and then cutting out the region that you need. This way, you can get an even higher pixel density / resolution than you would with a screenshot (simply because you can make the exported image larger than your screen).\nA note aside: if the chart in your PDF was a vector graphic (scalable without losing quality), converting it to a bitmap graphic will always lead to some quality loss. But Photoshop cannot handle vector graphics, of course.\nTo your question about the copy-paste behavior: I think it's because of the way Mac OS X's pasteboard works. It copies the whole PDF from Preview (along with the information about your selection rectangle) then, on pasting, maybe guesses or lets the receiving application decide which part of the information in the clipboard it wants to use. Photoshop seems to say \"just give me the whole PDF page, regardless of the selection\", while the Evernote's rich text editor says \"give me the selected part, converted to an image\"...\nIt's a bit like, if you copy formatted text from a Web site, then paste it into a word processor that supports rich text (such as Word), it will keep the formatting, otherwise (if it's a plain text editor), it will pull only the text content of the pasteboard object, ignoring the formatting.\n", "Q: Completely synchronise multiple Macs I actually have a Macbook Pro with Snow Leopard (I plan on upgrading to Lion).\nI may have to buy an Mac mini in order to have a full dual screen (external identical screens) layout (see my previous question).\nSo I will work on a Mac Mini and a Macbook Pro, most of the time on the same LAN.\nHow to get everything completely synchronised, as fast as possible?

Technically you should be able to install configure and mange users, applications etc all on the Mac Mini. Then you should be able to login via the MacBook Pro as a user on the server and pull down a configuration of Apps etc that you set up on server for your user accounts. See Considering OS X Server for home users.\n\nThis is just one example and it may be irrelevant to some people, so to understand the scope of what OS X Server has to offer it is best to look at all of its services lumped into four general categories: Account Management, File Sharing, Network Administration, and Web Services.\nUser account management\n...\nBeyond the directory itself are the domain management features of OS X, with which you can bind client Mac computers (such as your desktop iMac) to the server so the usernames and passwords in the server can be used to log in to the client Mac system. With this setup, you do not need to make new accounts on a system every time you want to allow someone to use a computer. Instead, you can go to the server and enable an account for a workstation, and that user can go log in to that system and use it. Additionally, if you purchase new systems all you need to do is bind them to the server and users can then log in to them with the same restrictions that they have on your other Macs (such as access only to certain applications, and only specific settings being available to them).\n\nAlso check out On Mobile Accounts and Syncing  where there is more research to be done at on how well OS X server does mobile accounts. It looks like Apples Offial name is Portable Home Directories as referenced from OS X Lion server spec under Client Management, this should allowing syncing to occur for your files in your home directory.\n\nA: Look into the application Chronosync.\n\nIt's not terribly cheap (not that it is particularly expensive either, but it's not your $5 have-a-go investment) but it syncs anything and everything.  You can use it for keeping a cloned boot drive, or for synching a directory 1 way, or 2 ways, or 2 ways and retain removed files in an archive etc etc.  You can run it with schedules like every X minutes, or it can do it dynamically, for example whenever the server (your Mini) notices that the client (your Macbook) has come online on the LAN, it will automatically sync at that point without requiring a set schedule - You don't even have to be logged in for this to happen.  Great product.\nDisclosure: I don't have anything to do with these guys but I am a paid customer.\n\nA: *\n\n*Chronosync looks like the shot. Sharing apps over a server is slow so you'd have to have apps installed on each Mac and maintain them separately. I don't think Chrono would handle apps. Select the folders you want to Sync with Chrono and every time you are back at your desktop do a sync.\n\n*Another possible way to go is to work from a fast external hard drive. In fact you could use this hard drive to boot from and work from. It would need to be FireWire800 or USB3. Perhaps a SSD. Just make sure to back this drive up often.\nI'm considering these two options.\n\nA: Fully synced between both devices? As far as I know it's not completely possible, there's certain aspects you'll need to manage yourself.\nHowever! That's not to say it's not possible to do a lot of it.\nCertain parts (iPhoto/Aperture) now go into your Photostream, but that's limited etc, so the best solution that I've seen is you need access to either a NAS device, or pay lots of money for the biggest amount of Dropbox space that you need. You then have the files centrally stored there, and then alias/symlink them into the 'correct' locations on each Mac. \nThat way when you open your iPhoto library on your Macbook Pro it knows the files are in X location and to edit them there. With Dropbox it stores them locally as well as remotely, so you could hack something like that with a NAS and then save yourself the network based performance hit.\n", "Q: Why do no external iPad/iPhone batteries charge via a dock connector? There are many external battery packs which have a USB port for charging your iPad or iPhone on the go. But they all seem to be charged via a Micro USB port themselves, rather than a dock connector.\nWhy?\nIs there some technical reason or does Apple not license the female dock connector?\n\nA: Actually, many do.  Here's one example, and here's another.\nThe reason is probably licensing.  Apple charges a fee for developing products using this connector, and I believe there's also a very small per-port royalty (as with FireWire).\n", "Q: unable to run ddd on mac I am trying to install ddd debugger on my MAC. It installed fine, however when I try to run it I get the following error:\nbash-3.2$ ddd test\nError: No `Ddd' application defaults file\nTo resolve this problem, you can:\n\nset the XAPPLRESDIR environment variable to the location of the file `Ddd', or\nset the DDD_HOME environment variable to the location of `ddd/Ddd', or\ninstall the `Ddd' file in the X application defaults directory, or\nrecompile DDD with builtin app-defaults file;\nsee the `--enable-builtin-app-defaults' option for details.\n\nI have X11 installed in my utilities folder. It works coz i use xterm on it quite often.\nany ideas how to fix this??\nanything I need to add to ./configure or make commands while installing ddd ???\n\nA: I was able to fix this from some hints from this site. \nAfter installing, you run the configure command again. This will create the Ddd file in the ddd folder. Now you can follow any of the steps that are printed out, I personally used the DDD_HOME variable with the patch to the sourcecode directory of ddd, since Ddd is now in $DDD_HOME/ddd/Ddd. \n", "Q: Will the 4G LTE used in an iPad bought in England also work in Sweden? If I buy a new iPad with 4G LTE in the United Kingdom, will the 4G LTE work in Sweden (with a SIM from a carrier offering 4G LTE obviously)?\nI am asking not least because of statements in this article that 4G LTE uses different bands in different countries.\n\nA: No.\nThe LTE standard uses different frequencies in the US and Europe. However, the model sold in Europe is the US model. This has been officially confirmed by Apple [1, german].\nLTE in the iPad\nThe iPad supports only the frequencies 700 and 2100 MHz [2] for LTE use. These frequencies are not used for LTE in the EU.\nIf you take a look at the footnotes, Apple states on their website (US and foreign) that:\n\n4G LTE (is only) supported on AT&T and Verizon networks in the U.S.; Bell, Rogers, and Telus networks in Canada.\n\nLTE worldwide [3]\nThe following frequencies aren't really such even numbers. They are frequency bands that spread out over a whole spectrum of which little fragments are divided among carriers.\n\n*\n\n*USA: 700, 1800, 2100 MHz\n\n*Canada and Mexico: 1800, 2100 MHz\n\n*European Union:  800, 1800, 2600 MHz * (bands in use differ widely)\n\n*Asia in general: 1800, 2600 MHz\n\n*Australia: 1800 MHz\n\nThere also exists this table [4] which lists very detailed information on frequencies bands used world wide. You can see here that the the 2100 MHz band is used for UMTS and IMT (= 3G standards) in Europe. The 700 MHz band does not seem to be used by carries in Europe.\n\nA: Here's an article that specifically mentions that the new iPad will not support 4G connectivity in Sweden:\n\nWhile there has been a rapid build-out of 4G networks in the U.S. and countries such as South Korea, LTE is still scarce in Europe. Even in Sweden, one of the few European countries with broad LTE coverage, it seems users of the new iPad won’t be able to make use of the 4G connectivity.\nSwedish telecom newsletter Telekomnyheterna noted that the new iPad only supports LTE on the 700 MHz and 2100 MHz frequencies. In Sweden the 700 MHz frequency band is used for television broadcasts, while the 2100 band is used for 3G data traffic, and it’s unlikely that any of these bands will be re-farmed to LTE.\nSource: http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/03/08/new-ipad-not-quite-so-fast-in-europe/\n\n(The article does leave open the possibility that Apple may still release a different configuration of the new iPad supporting 4G connectivity in Europe.)\n\nA: Sadly the term \"4G\" has been co-opted by marketing, and it's hard to know what anyone means when they use it. \nGizmodo reports that here in the UK, as in the US, each carrier has a different 4G standard, and the iPad 3 as sold here may not work with \"4G\" on any British carriers. Apple have crammed a huge number of radio protocols into that thing, though, so even if it can't get 4G speeds it can get \"3G+\" on networks like Three.\nThe practical answer is that an iPad 3 that you buy in the UK will definitely work on the Swedish mobile networks, and that you're likely to see better speeds that you would with an iPad 2. As @Rinzwind points out you will definitely not get 4G in Sweden with a British iPad, but you won't really be getting 4G in the UK either.\n", "Q: listing all processes in iOS 5.0.1 How could one go about viewing all the processes in an ssh session to my (jailbroken)iphone?

I often find myself wanting to sync my iPhone with iTunes when I'm in the middle of listening to a podcast. Currently iTunes removes that podcast from the iPhone while syncing.\nIs it possible to configure iTunes to only remove podcasts played through to the end?\nFor the purposes of this question, assume I am halfway finished listening to the newest episode of a podcast and there are no newer episodes available.\nUPDATE: this issue is no longer affecting me. Either an iTunes or iOS update (or something else) must have happened. Everything works swimmingly now.\n\nA: This IS actually the case. \n\nWhat you should have a look at is the selection option that you have set. \n\nFor instance, if you ask to only sync the \"3 most recent unplayed episodes\", it might be that the one you are listening to will be replace on your iPhone by the newly released episodes that have been downloaded in iTunes. When the episode you haven't finished will be one of the 3 candidates to be synced (i.e. \"when you have listened to all the newer episodes\"), the listening will continue where you were the last time you listen to it.\nEDIT after the EDIT of the Question :\nHm, ok, with this edit my answer is not right anymore BUT i think you should have a way have it work as you want. If you select for instance \"the oldest unread\", the one you are listening to will be kept on the iPhone (if you listen to the episodes in order that they are realeased) Another trick is to use the checkboxes on the left of each episode and set the preference to \"Sync only checked\"\n", "Q: Word 2011 for Mac: keyboard shortcut for turning balloons on/off in review mode Does anybody know if I can create a keyboard shortcut to toggle \"Use balloons to display changes\"? \nAlso, is there a webpage where one can vote for features for the next Word release?

But you're in luck, because you can assign one using Tools -> Customize Keyboard. See the example below.\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between \"all unplayed\" and \"all new\" podcasts? When configuring the syncing of podcasts between iTunes and a device, it's possible to automatically sync \"all unplayed\" and \"all new\" podcasts.\nIt's not clear to me what the difference is between unplayed and new podcasts. An Apple Support Communities post explains it as follows:\n\nUnplayed podcasts, are those that have previously been synced to your iPod, but have yet to be played while new podcasts are those that have been synced to your iPod for the first time.\n\nIf this is the case, what's the difference in sync behavior between the \"all unplayed\" and \"all new\" settings?\n\nA: If you have three podcasts as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*A - downloaded, synced and played\n\n*B - downloaded, synced and not played\n\n*C - newly downloaded, never synced, and not played\n\n\nWhen choosing \"all unplayed\", podcasts B & C will by synced. A will be removed from the iDevice\nWhen choosing \"all new\", only C will be synced.  A & B will be removed from the iDevice\n\nA: The difference seems to rest on partial playback. New means you haven't listened to even part of the podcast, whereas unplayed means you haven't finished listening to the podcast.\nIn testing, it seems:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes for Mac (v. 10.6.3) tips from new to unplayed at 15 seconds into a track\n\n*iTunes for iPhone (iOS v. 5.1.1) tips from new to unplayed at 5% into a track\n\n\nNote this is based on quick experiments, not cited documentation or the like.\n", "Q: Best mode for a router I have this wireless router I use to connect my iPhone and iPad.

Your devices should pick the faster protocol (N) if they support it. If not, they'll use the slower protocol (G).\nBut between G and N you've got just about all modern wireless devices covered so your network should be friendly to everything WiFi you bring in to it.\n\nA: Pretty much any new iOS based device, including the Apple TV etc, will happily use Wireless \"n\" (150Mb or even 300Mb).\nPractically nothing that you own will still use \"b\" (11Mb) - the only devices I have are Nintendo DS, and an ancient Palm organiser.\nAlmost everything else you might have that isn't particular new, or isn't Apple kit, will support \"g\" (54mb) - Playstations, older windows laptops, non apple phones/tablets, portable gaming systems like the PSP etc etc.\nSo, for preference I would have G/N.  If you have a kid with a DS, consider B/G/N.  Bear in mind that Nintendo DS cannot accept WPA authentication, and do WEP as a maximum, and thus if you want to use them, you run the risk of reducing the security on all the other devices.\n", "Q: Can I grab the content from a .pages file, without using Pages.app? I’m interested in automatically extracting the content of .pages documents, preferably via a programming language on a web server.\nThere are quite a few references around the web that say Pages documents are actually zipped archives containing various files (e.g. http://www.tuaw.com/2009/11/02/iwork-secret-life-as-zip-file-revealed-includes-pdf-preview/), but a Pages document sent to me by a friend doesn’t seem to be unzippable by Mac OS X’s Archive Utility, or The Unarchiver, no matter what I change the extension to.\nIs there a way to get the content from recent Pages files?\n\nA: Apple provides a hosted solution called iWork.com and has snazzy videos showing how it works. I believe it is still in beta despite being available for tens of months, and was announced that \"As of July 31, 2012, you will no longer be able to access your documents on the iWork.com site or view them on the web.\". \nIt's not clear if this will roll into iCloud once the iOS versions and the OSX versions of the apps reach parity in file format. At the moment, the capabilities and file formats are not close enough to work together well. Also keep in mind that Mountain Lion is slated for release this summer and the current versions of Pages, Numbers and Keynote are all marketed as iWork '09 and perhaps could be revamped to provide this interface using iCloud.\nLion Server does this for you as part of the Wiki Functionality. Many documents - including Pages will be rendered into a mostly html5 / css3 web page so that viewers of the wiki and embedded/uploaded documents on mobile or other client platforms do not need a Pages viewer app and can just use a modern web browser.\n\nI could expect you were looking for more of an open-source solution where you had inner workings of the tools better documented, but this is a widely available and quite low cost solution for some to the problem you ask. \n\nA: If you're trying to roll your own solution, the actual .pages file is a package. If you right click it, you can show package contents. Inside the resulting folder will be all the graphic files plus a file called index.xlm.gz. If you unzip the file, it is an xml file containing all the text in the pages document.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 previous back up help how can I view all dates of my previous back ups & how can I restore all of my lost photos without connecting to another computer? please say this is possible and help by telling me how I can do this. thank you very much if you can help:)\n\nA: There are two ways to back up iPhones. One is through iTunes, and the other is through iCloud (seeing that you have an iPhone 4S). \nIf you have enabled iCloud backup, then you can restore your phone by wiping it (Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings) and tapping Restore from iCloud backup after your phone comes up again, then logging into your iCloud backup. Note that iCloud only saves the \"latest\" backup, and may not have the pictures if you actually (accidentally) deleted them from your phone.\nIf you have backed it up through iTunes, then plug in your phone, select \"Restore\" (I didn't walk through these steps myself just now, so they may not be click by click accurate), and select the backup that you would like to restore to your phone. I'm not sure if iTunes just saves the latest or if it will save multiple versions of your phone.\n", "Q: Mac surface scan tool I've had an SDcard lose its partition table, so I want to run a surface scan of the sdcard to make sure it's physically okay. Can you suggest a disk surface scan tool that runs on the Mac? Free, preferably.

I want to bring my iPad to a beach to do some reading while on vacation. I am concerned about sand getting into its ports and causing damage. Obviously water would also be a concern, but I am not planning on taking it in any water. Does sand propose a significant threat and what can be done to limit the chances of a problem occurring? \n\nA: Yes you can, but there are some aspects of the environment of the beach life that need to be controlled.\n\n\n*\n\n*Salt water corrodes electronics fiercely. Waves crashing means that the atmosphere at a beach is saturated with water droplets with a high concentration of salt in many cases.\n\n*Direct sun on the front black face of any iOS device can over heat it rapidly. You will probably feel it uncomfortably hot before the point where the device shuts itself off to prevent battery damage. Even if the device is powered down, you can permanently damage any Lithium Polymer battery in a few hours if the temperature is hot enough.\n\n*Sand can get in the home button mechanism and may never come out. The 30 pin connector, the headphone jack, a SIM slot are easier to clean and less likely to be functionally impaired than the close tolerances of the glass on glass home button gap. \n\n*Bright light makes it harder to see the backlit screen and if you are wearing polarized sunglasses, you will see that the display is highly polarized. It's fun from a science experiment aspect, but bad for reading or color accuracy of the display.\n\n\nI would probably have a Chef Sleeve or two with me and bring an umbrella or shade to control the light and direct heat. A ziplock bag also works if you don't think the closer fitting sleeve is worth spending money on. Depending on your beach some or all of these concerns may be disregarded, but I tried to cover the common beach scenarios.\nOther than that - keep it cool, heat yourself up and enjoy your iPad on the beach.\n\nA: I use an OtterBox Defender case to protect my iPad in harsh environments. If I'm using it as a \"chart plotter\" on a small boat or kayak, I also put it into a waterproof map bag (along with a desiccant packet) that I got from an outdoor store. \nFor occasional use, you can also protect the iPad within a 1 gallon Zip-Loc™ bag. (Again, I'd add a desiccant packet if you're using it in a humid environment). I keep a Zip-Loc in my go bag for this purpose.\n\n\nA: I'm going to expand my comment to @bmike's answer into another answer to this question for future seekers. Consider buying a Kindle for beach use.\nPlease understand that I applaud the desire to use the iPad for reading on the beach. As I see it, I paid real money for the tool, and if I'm not going use that tool as I want to, I shouldn't have bothered. That being said, there are certain risks and inconveniences that accompany this (and all) decision.\nFirst, @bmike is correct about the danger that heat presents to portable electronics. That being said, my experience has taught me that if you're going to read with the iPad, you'll either seek or make shade. That risk is manageable. You'll also want to take proper care to keep your iPad cool when you're not using it. Options include a bag in the shade or (assuming the iPad is appropriately protected) in the top tray of a large cooler. Please, don't toss it down into the ice.\nPerhaps a higher risk comes from flashing an expensive piece of kit on public beaches, both here and abroad. Assuming you're not going to stuff it into a waterproof case whenever the urge to take a dip strikes, or carry it with you as you and a loved one stroll hand-in-hand along the beach, the iPad presents a juicy target of opportunity to those who just weren't raised right (or for whom an iPad sold means eating tonight). It also brands you as a rich tourista and perhaps paints an even bigger target on your own person. (I trust my spanish-speaking friends here will forgive the slight as none is intended, it's just the linqua franca for much of my beach travel).\nAdd this risk to the inconvenience or as some would say, utter unreadability, of the LCD screen in bright sunlight and I can make a reasonable argument for leaving the iPad back in the room, and tossing a (relatively disposable) Kindle into my beach bag.\n", "Q: What is wireless beaming and how do I use it? In the new version of iPhoto for iOS it has a setting for \"Wireless Beaming\". I'm not quite sure what this even is. If I can share photos among devices, do they all have to have iPhoto installed? What is used to do the \"beaming\"? Do I have to have wi-fi or bluetooth on?\n\n\nA: How to use Wireless Beaming\nThe first step is to install iPhoto on two iOS devices such as an iPhone and an iPad on which iPhoto is compatible. You then start up iPhoto on both devices and head to the \"gear\" icon which is the settings menu. You want \"Wireless Beaming\" set to On for both devices inside of here. As far as I can tell, you actually need to have both devices on the same wifi network for this to work, so if necessary turn on wifi and connect to a shared network. From this point, all you have to do is find an image and click the share button(pointy arrow) which brings up the share menu. Inside of that you will find an option for \"Beam\" that looks like a wifi network icon. Once you hit the beam icon you can then select up to 100 images to share, and you are provided with a list of devices to share the images with. Once you select the \"Beam Photos\" button, the receiving device will be asked for a confirmation, and within seconds the images are sent.\nWhat exactly is Wireless Beaming\nWireless beaming requires both devices to be on the same wifi network. The Bonjour networking from Apple is working behind the scenes to create a zeroconf network that keeps it dead simple for the user. According to this article iPhoto Beaming: Under the hood - iPhoto Beaming uses a UDP service called _mobileiphoto._udp. The article also describes that it looks as though this communication is setup specifically for iPhoto only, and not as an iOS wide implementation of file sharing. To send the files, the source iPhoto looks for potential recipients, connects to them, negotiates a handshake, asks for permission from the receiver, and sends the files. More detail with flows can be found at the link above.\nAs ughoavgfhw pointed out in the comments, the Apple iPhoto site notes that the functionality works over wifi OR bluetooth, but I have not been able to verify this, and other users have noted it requires the same wifi network. I will be testing this on my own shortly.\n", "Q: Issue with Mail, receiving my own sent emails in Inbox I have 2 Gmail accounts hooked up to Mail.  One is an @gmail.com account, the other is a business account run through Google Apps.  \nWhen I send an email from the business account, the email always shows up in my Inbox as if the message was sent to me.  \nThe \"Automatically Cc or Bcc me\" checkbox is unchecked in the \"Composing\" section of the Preferences.  \nIf I send the email from the gmail website, no problems occur.  If I send an email from my \"@gmail.com\" address the problem does not occur.  \nAnyone have any advice?\n\nA: I've solved the problem for my own use. The problem for me was a glitch in gmail itself. Elsewhere the question was asked, does this behavior happen with messages sent from the gmail web interface as well? If those messages are also showing up in your gmail inbox, it's probably not a Mail fault. Check your gmail filters for the following:\n\nWhen you use a filter with the \"never send to spam\" option enabled\n  that is (accidentally perhaps) matching message you send, they will\n  show in the Inbox.\n\nThis is considered by some to be a gmail bug. The solution is:\n\nThe filter does the same thing as the \"Not spam\" button, which puts\n  the selected conversations in the Inbox. You can exclude sent mail\n  from your \"Never send to spam\" filters by including \"-me\" in the From\n  field, or by adding \"-from:me\" in the \"has the words\" field.\n\nIn my experience it is not necessary to fully comply with Google's recommended settings for IMAP accounts, namely that you should uncheck the box to \"Store sent messages on the server.\" I very much want to leave this selected, and having it selected is now working fine for me, now that I have added the \"-me\" exception to the misbehaving filter.\nRefer to these threads for further background: \nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/hdItaHiUAgc\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/NI1aRo6SvTc\n\nA: If you're retrieving your mail from the account in Apple Mail using POP, I had a similar problem and it turned out to be because My 'Sent Mail' is downloaded to my POP inbox. Changing to IMAP solved it using Google's recommended IMAP settings.\nAlternatively, it might be because conversations are enabled in gmail.\n\nA: I believe I have fixed the issue.  It seems that my SMTP for my business account was offline and was using my SMTP for the regular Gmail account.  \nAs soon as I got it back online and told it to use the SMTP for the business account it no longer shows up in my Inbox.  \nI have no idea why it was doing that, but this seems to have fixed it.\n", "Q: How Should I Correct the Owners and Permissions in an OS X User Folder? My issue is that I've seriously busted all of the owners and permissions on my user folder and subfolders and it's causing lots of issues using lots of applications.\nThe initial cause was that I had renamed a user by following the Apple support instructions at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1428\nAfter the new user was set up, Mozy backup wouldn't backup any more and lots of my applications couldn't update themselves automatically. The application usually started working again if I deleted the offending program and reinstalled it. I thought it was because the permissions were wrong and I found some places where GetInfo indicated that permissions were referencing the old user. Sometimes the dialog just said \"Fetching\" for the username and never updated to anything else. \nI ran Onyx \"fix permissions\" and Disk Utility \"Repair Permissions\" with no results. With \"Repair Permissions\", it keeps throwing some info warnings about unexpected ACLs, but the info I could find online didn't think those would be causing issues like this.\nI tried to recursively run some command line scripts on the user folders (both logged in as root and using sudo). chmod got lots of errors about the owner of the files being wrong. chown after that gave me other errors (I can't remember exactly what they were). In a fit of panic, I right-clicked the entire user folder and chose to apply it's permissions to all children. \nFrom what I can tell, when I did that, I set everything to Read&Write for that user and Read-Only for \"everyone\" and \"staff\". Now, I'm worse off than before. Firefox crashed and it can't even update it's own settings so it brings up the \"Do you want to restore these tabs\" every single time it launches, even after repeatedly saying \"Start New Session\".\nBasically, everything in my user folder is broken with regards to owner and permissions and I need to know what they are supposed to be. Who is the owner of the files in each directory supposed to be (Downloads, Applications, etc.) and what should the permissions be? Given those permissions and owners, what is the best way to go about setting those all right?\nI saw a question similar to this at Resetting user permissions to their default mode but it only addresses permissions, not owners, which has been an issue already.\nI'm not sure if reinstalling the OS over the copy I have right now would fix anything and I'm close to calling Apple Support if I can't figure anything out in the next few days. Thanks for any help.\n\nA: Run this\ncd $HOME\n{ sudo chflags -R nouchg,nouappnd ~ $TMPDIR.. ; \\\nsudo chown -R $UID:staff ~ $_ ; \\\nsudo chmod -R -N ~ $_ ; \\\nsudo chmod -R 755 ~ $_ ; \\\nsudo chmod 700 Desktop Documents Downloads Dropbox Library Movies Music Pictures Sites $_ ; \\\nsudo chmod 777 Public ; \\\nsudo chmod 733 Public/Drop\\ Box ; \\\n} 2> /dev/null\n\n\nA: Your issues are basically the same. There is no standard for permissions for files in your home directory they all depend on their use.\nFixing permissions apps and scripts and OS installs should not affect the user area at all except maybe changing the permissions on the home directory. OS installs and most fix permissions scripts compare the permissions and owners to what is required for a clean install and this has no normal users. If they did I would consider this as a major bug.\nThe fix is to change the owner of the files ie use of chown on your home directory. The owner should be the new owner name. \nThere is no general way of getting permissions back as individual files depend on there application and all apps can be different.\nThus the only way is to restore from a backup before the change - do the change as per Apples notes and then chown all the files.\nOr look at each individual file and work out what permissions it should have - for most files your home directory this should be read/write for the owner and nothing (or read only ) for others. Directories will also need execute permission so that they can be listed. Applications will need other permissions.\n\nA: The first step I would recommend is to try resetting your home folder permissions with the Reset Password utility in Lion Recovery. (Despite the name of the utility, you won't actually be resetting any passwords.)\nResetting the home folder permissions with the Reset Password utility will reset both the owner and the permissions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Mac holding ⌘+R to boot into Lion Recovery, which will bring you to the Repair Utilities screen.\n\n*Open Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\n*In Terminal, enter resetpassword to open the Reset Password utility.\n\n*Choose your hard drive icon at the top, then choose your user from the drop-down menu below. Do not reset the password here.\n\n*At the bottom of the window, under \"Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs\", click the \"Reset\" button. This may take awhile if you have a lot of files in your home folder.\nThis should solve your permissions problems for most apps. However, it's possible you may have a few apps which had saved files with special permissions that are different from the user's default permissions (like preferences or application support files). For those apps, you may need to delete their preferences or reinstall the app.\nIf resetting your home folder permissions doesn't work, then you may need to try restoring from a backup or transferring your data to an external drive.\n\nA: We have run into the same issues with several users. After unsuccessfully trying everything regarding fixing permissions, we found a solution. For the sake of clarity, the problematic user's is John Doe and the user account (and home directory) is called \"johndoe\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your root user is enabled. Log out\n\n*Log in as root and make a backup of the johndoe home folder (creating a backup of home folder is optional, but strongly recommended in case something goes wrong)\n\n*Open System Preferences/Users & Groups\n\n*Delete the johndoe user—you will be prompted as to what to do with the johndoe's Home directory\n\n*IMPORTANT: Choose NOT to delete the directory\n\n*Go to /Users and note that johndoe's folder has been renamed to \"john doe (deleted)\"; rename the home directory back to \"johndoe\"\n\n*Go back to System Preferences/Users & Groups and recreate John Doe's account\n\n*IMPORTANT: Make sure user's Account Name is the \"john doe\", or exactly what you named the home directory in step 6\n\n*You will be prompted that the home directory with that name already exists and if you want to use the existing home directory\n\n*Choose yes\n\n*Restart and log in as John Doe\n\n\nA: I'm adding a single answer to address everything. Whatever I did with the permissions, it was totally borked. I tried the first answer, booting into Recovery Mode and resetting the permissions via the reset password method, but that ran for 48 hours before I killed it and had no discernable effect. I tried to restore from Time Machine and that actually blew up as well and was unable to restore the backup. \nI ended up backing everything up manually to an external disk, formatting the entire disk and reinstalling Lion, reinstalling everything manually, and copying my personal data, such as the iPhoto library and iTunes libraries, back manually. iPhoto had to repair the library but worked fine and I've had no issues. iTunes was unable to add any music to the library until I used Disk Utility to repair permissions again. Since I only copied the iTunes Media directory and not the parent directory, it seemed to fix everything.\nMoral of the story: Forget Apple, don't rename users. \n\nA: This is not a permission problem at all!  Nothing you do with permissions will fix it because the permissions are already set to read/write, which is as permissive as they can be.  \nIt’s an owner problem; the system is confused about who owns the file, and cannot resolve the quandary.  Add yourself as a new owner, give yourself read/write permissions, and then delete the offending “fetching” user.\n\nA: Disk Utility's Reset Permissions feature doesn't affect your home directory, so it won't work here. But it also has a second, hidden permissions reset tool for your home directory. You use it from Terminal, like this:\ndiskutil resetUserPermissions / $(id -u)\n\n(Source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203538)\n", "Q: Address Book App adds the letter \"n\" to my notes The Address Book app adds the letter \"n\" to notes of contacts in most of my contacts. In the Notes field I randomly see the letter added in front of names, numbers etc. \nI have off course tried to delete the letter, but after a sync the letters are back. I see both 1, 2 and 3 repeats of the same letter in my notes.\nWhat to do?\n\nA: I think this is a bug with iCloud. I started seeing the same behavior when I started using iCloud. When I turned iCloud off and went back to syncing over the cable, the issue of extra \"n\"s went away. \nTry backing up your address book (just in case) and turning off iCloud for a while. If that fixes it, you can make the choice on if you would rather have it on and deal with the \"n\"s or off and have to sync with the cable. \nOf course, this will also likely get fixed in future release as iCloud is tweaked\n", "Q: How do I share bluetooth keyboard with iPhone and iMac without re-pairing every time?

But when a text message comes in, or I want to type a long password on my iPhone, I want to use my apple bluetooth keyboard to type on my iPhone for a bit, and then switch back to typing on my iMac.\n\nA: While a device (iMac or iPhone) can have a number of peripherals attached it it, a peripheral can only be attached to one device at a time. So you will need to re-pair it every time.\n\nA: try ikeyboard in the mac app store\n\nA: I just came across this keyboard from Logitech that is a hardware solution to do what you want.\nThis keyboard is a MAC keyboard that can be programed to switch devices with one button. \n", "Q: What are the historic OS X versions' 'selling lines'?

Will the iPad use the retina version of the iphone app or stick with the normal version?\n\nA: The German magazine c't (or rather the new \"Mac & i\") tested the new iPad (3rd gen.) and found that it finally uses retina graphics in the iPhone apps that provide them:\n\nÜbrigens stellt das iPad 3 auch Apps, die für das Retina-Display des iPhone 4(S) optimiert wurden, schärfer und ansprechender dar als sein Vorgänger – iOS zieht nun also endlich die optimierten Grafiken heran. Das wirkt sich positiv auf beide Darstellungsvarianten aus, auf die Originalgröße und den \"2x\"-Modus.\n\nTranslation:\nBy the way, apps that are optimized for the retina display of the iPhone 4 (S) are displayed by the new iPad sharper and more appealing than by its predecessor - iOS now finally uses the optimized graphics. This has a positive effect on both display variants the original size and the \"2x\" mode.\n\nA: When you run the iPad 5.1 simulator in retina-mode, it seems that iPhone apps are using retina graphics at 1x. As the new iPad screen is 1536x2048 (portrait) and a retina iPhone app is 640x960, it's still the same physical size as a non-retina iPhone app in a non-retina iPad.\nSo my guess is that yes, the new iPad will use retina-graphics in iPhone apps, but they will look the same size at 1x as non-retina iPhone apps in a non-retina iPad, and 2x will only double the graphics.\nKeep in mind that the iPad simulator is just - as the name implies - a simulator. Although it's usually a good indication, there's no guarantee that the hardware will behave in the same way.\n\nA: Using apps which supported the retina display on iPhone 4 on an iPad always resulted in them rendering the non-retina scale graphics. A tweak is available for jailbroken devices to select the retina graphic assets instead so it is feasibly possible, Apple just don't do it as standard.\nI suspect that the iPhone compatibility was a crutch to help people over the initial period while there weren't many iPad apps and cannot see Apple implementing it any time soon.\n", "Q: How do I disable the \"Syncing iPod. Do not disconnect.\" warning in iTunes? When syncing my iPod to iTunes, I always get this message:\n\nI've had my iPod for several years now and I'd like to disable that warning, so I can see what's copying, how long it will take, etc., since I already know that I'm not supposed to disconnect my iPad. I know that I can click the little triangle on the left side to see the progress, but I don't want to have to do that. Is there a way to disable that warning?\n\nA: My experience with this issue is that that bar's display changes between \"do not disconnect\" message and the status of sync info. So it's not that static info saying \"do not disconnect\" all the time.\nAnyway. There is no such tweak for disabling that message there since it's mandatory.\nCheers, C@N.\n", "Q: Two Photo Streams, one iPhoto library My wife and I share the same iPhoto library, which exists on a mounted disk image with each of our user accounts pointing to this same shared library.\nWe each have iPhones and I wondered whether our respective photo-streams that seemed to work reasonably well on our individual logins could be 'automated' to copy from these streams into the main, shared library?\nEssentially, is there any way for two photo-streams from two users to end up in this shared iPhoto library?\n\nA: To solve the problem you state, Dropbox would allow you to upload all the photos from two devices to one account (or two accounts) and then set up folder actions on a Mac to combine, import and delete the photos from the dropbox storage.\nThere isn't any \"mix these two\" photostreams function in iPhoto or Aperture and the web interface doesn't have any functionality to match that as well.\nThere is a way to push photos (manually) to a shared photo stream, and then both of you would see the same content in that stream, but it's designed for one person to push - not for several to collaborate and publish together.\nThe pragmatic solution is to set a calendar reminder once a month for both of you to export the pictures. I let iPhoto automatically import all pictures from my Photo Stream and it conveniently makes a November 2012 Photo Stream event and I export those original photos to my archive drive that sits on a shelf other than when it's time to archive. Rather than archiving (or perhaps in addition to), you would then do the steps needed to export and import the batch of photos into the library you chose to contain both pictures.\nThis both isn't automatic and also means that photos will be potentially duplicated if the library holding the merged content is different than the library that received the stream from iCloud.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add an internal broadband card to MacBook Air? I have a Mid-2011 MacBook Air 11\". Can I add a Verizon (or any kind of) broadband card to it internally? We want to avoid having an awkward USB modem hanging off the side.\n\nA: No unfortunately the only options are really external. Until someone can come up with a 3G / 4G card that will work in place of the MacBook Airs Wifi / Bluetooth card, but even then how portable are the antennas designs between Wifi and 3G / 4G cellular signals, not sure it would work well if at all.\nSee iFixits teardown of the MacBook Air 11\":\n \nA mobile WiFi Hot Spot is a real option for now, essentially a portable broadband card that interfaces with your Mac via Wifi to allow a data connection. Also if have a smartphone such as an iPhone or Android phone that offers this Wifi sharing you can use one of those as well to do the same thing.\nThese kinds of devices have their own battery and would allow  you to tuck them away in a backpack, bag, pocket etc and use your MacBook Air with out any dongles, etc.\n\n", "Q: How much time do I have left on my iPhone 4s I just checked and it says the battery on my iPhone 4s is 30% charged. If I leave my phone off, how much time will it have left? What if I turn it off?\nI need to know if I'll be able to use this phone 6 hours later.\n\nA: While I do not think there is any official testing data that can accurately answer your question, turning off your iPhone should more than certainly leave you with battery 6 hours later.\nIn the past, I've tested out the standby capabilities of both my iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. My test consisted of charging the iPhones to 100%, switching them to Airplane Mode, and locking the screen. I left them in that state over night (about 9 hours) and checked the battery percentage. They both reported 98% to 100% capacity, which surprised me greatly.\nSo I would like to think that you powering your iPhone 4s for 6 hours should keep the bulk of your charge in place. Maybe left with 25% of charge.\nOf course, this is all assumption ;).\n\nA: So yes you should be fine letting the phone sit for 6 hours, assuming it is not doing anything else and just idling in cellular Standby mode. If you really need the phone to be ready your safest bet is to power it down, then you know its not using any power for certain.\nAccording to Apple's Spec for the iPhone 4S it gets about these times with 100% charge so roughly 30% of these number should give a rough estimate of how much time you can you run it for with a 30% charge remaining: \n\nTalk time: Up to 8 hours on 3G, up to 14 hours on 2G (GSM)\n\n2.4 hours 3G,  4.2 hours 2G  \n\nStandby time: Up to 200 hours\n\n60 hours\n\nInternet use: Up to 6 hours on 3G, up to 9 hours on Wi-Fi\n\n1.8 hours 3G, 2.7 hours Wi-Fi   \n\nVideo playback: Up to 10 hours\n\n3 hours\n\nAudio playback: Up to 40 hours\n\n12 hours\n\nA: Hard to say, but if you are only talking a few hours, then airplane mode uses less than a couple of percent overnight for me, and will actually use less power than performing a shutdown and restart when you want it later.\n\nA: Turning your phone off and back on will use up unnecessary power.\nTake your phone, activate airplane mode, and then lock it. If you only need to wait 6 hours, this will probably give you the most battery remaining at the end of your wait.\nIf your wait time were longer, turning it off might use less power than having it on the entire time, but in this case I believe the duration is short enough to not warrant a restart (which is an electronically expensive operation for most machines).\n\nA: It depends! If you have app's running in the background using location based services and/or accessing network then it will be possibly out in 3-4 hours.\nI would suggest you to turn off push notifications, turn off WLAN, turn off bluetooth and turn off automatic mail downloads. I would also consider shutting down apps like Facebook, Skype, Imo etc since they keep a network connection up in the background.\nIf I have such a low battery (and I can't recharge) I usually do shut down all running apps.\n", "Q: How does iOS app DRM work, exactly? When I purchase an app in iTunes on my Windows computer, I get an *.ipa file that is a self-contained iOS application package. I can browse the contents of these IPA files with 7-Zip and even extract resources and other details, which suggests these IPA files aren't encrypted at all.\nSo if they aren't encrypted, how does DRM work? What's stopping me from copying an IPA file to someone else's computer and importing the IPA into iTunes and then installing it on someone else's device?\nAlso, can someone please confirm that so long as I keep the IPA file I will be able to install it to my iDevices (under the same Apple ID, of course)? I'm just concerned that in future an app might be updated to remove features or might even be pulled from the app store completely.\n\nA: Actually, it works more like SSL. Upon signing up for an Apple account Apple generates a Public/Private Key pair for your username. It then gives you your private key and it keeps your public. (That's why when you first buy or when you restore your iDevice you must activate it with your iTunes account). Upon activation it transfers your private key to your iDevice. Basically what happens is when you buy an app (free or paid) Apple generate a 4096 byte long header that is encrypted with your public key.\nIf you have any understanding of Public/private keys, the public key can encrypt for it's private pair... For example I would use a servers public key to encrypt data to send to the server. The server would then use it's private key to decrypt it. When it wants to send data back, it uses my public key to encrypt the data and I use my private key to decrypt it! Public keys can only encrypt data and cannot decrypt and vice-versa for private keys.\nWhen you download your app it has a header encrypted with your public key. Only your private key can decrypt the header embedded in the app. So for example, if I copied an IPA generated for you, and put it on my iDevice (this is assuming you can get It there, iTunes would refuse to sync it anyway), and then I tried to run it, it would simply crash because my private key wouldn't be able to decrypt the header! Also its worth noting that the IPA file (an IPA is essentially a zip file that's been renamed) doesn't have the header, if you take a look at the contents of an IPA you will realize that it contains an extension-less file, take Facebook's app for example, it would have a file named 'Facebook'. This is the app's binary, and this is the file that has the encrypted header in it.\nYes, as stated above your apps will continue to run so long as you can remember your Apple ID as the iDevice (and iTunes) does NO signature checking with iTunes what-so-ever! This means you can install removed apps and also sync older IPAs to your device so long as they are yours and you still have the IPA indefinitely! \n\nA: Just change the extension from .ipa to .zip. If you are using an old version of iTunes, the IPA file will be in:\nC:\\user\\ ...\\music\\itunes\\mobile applications \n\nWere you see ... Go to the user you were using when you downloaded the app.\n", "Q: Convenient way to store sensitive information on Mac/iPad? Currently I keep an obscurely-named text file on my hard drive which contains things like bank account and credit card details, various passwords, PINs, and other bits of sensitive/confidential information. Obviously this is not too secure and I'd really like to keep this information encrypted and password-protected. I'm thinking of something like Keychain Access, but for small amounts of free form text rather than just passwords, and it would need to be quick and convenient to access (i.e. so not something like a password-protected Word document). If it could work on both a Mac and an iOS device like an iPad, and sync between the two, then that would be a bonus.\n\nA: I use 1Password. I a bit pricey but worth it. There are iOS and Mac OS versions. You have to purchase both. Where 1Password really shines is for website logins. There's a demo for the Mac on their site.\n\nA: I use Acrylic's Wallet, works well on iOS and Mac OS.\nhttp://www.acrylicapps.com/wallet/mac/\n\nA: I use, and recommend Splash ID which I have found to be very user friendly. For each \"item\" that you create (say bank account) you have 10 different forms that you can name the forms and put in whatever you like as well as a comment section which allows for much longer amounts of text. It also work on iOS ($10 from the app store I think). It's normally $20 but I found a coupon online for $10 off.\nI believe it to be very secure, and it handles copy and paste really well.\n\nA: I've had much success with Mac's inbuilt Keychain Access.\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2013756/how-to-manage-passwords-with-keychain-access.html\n", "Q: How can I move an email without deleting it from iCloud server? I have local rules on my Mac to move emails from certain people into their own local folders, and sound a unique alert.  The problem is that it appears that moving it causes it to be deleted from iCloud's IMAP server, and therefore not delivered to my iOS devices.\nWhen I changed the rule to copy rather than move, I'm left with duplicate emails in the local Inbox folder (not surprisingly).\nI tried creating iCloud Mail folders and using iCloud Mail rules to move certain emails into those folders.  That's fine, except that I can't sound the alert: it appears that Mac Mail rules only apply to mail coming directly into the Inbox.  (Also, only iCloud Inbox items get 'pushed' -- the mail in my JohnDoe folder can only be retrieved when Mac Mail polls every N minutes.)\nI'm new to IMAP, so I may have missed the solution.  Can anyone suggest how, using iCloud Mail, I can:\n\n\n*\n\n*See the same email in my Mac and all my iOS devices\n\n*Automatically route certain email to special folders and sound an alert, at least on the Mac\n\n\nThanks-\nChap\n\nA: From what I read, you actually are almost there. It looks like your problem may be how the folders are done (as in, locally or on the server).\nAs you said in your answer, you copy the emails to local folders, so therefore they would never be on your phone. And with iCloud's limited rules (in the cloud), as you note, you cant really make a sound or do much with them either. \nAs long as your Mac is always running (to run the rules), you really would only need to update your local mail rules to put the emails in the servers folders. This way if you are at your computer, you would hear the audio cues, as well as have the mail filtered. If you step away, as long as your Mac could still process the mail, it will copy the emails to the correct server folders, and be available. \nOn your Mac now, you should see two inboxes, iCloud and 'On My Mac'. Make sure folders exist under the iCloud account for where these messages should go. Then update your rules to point to the iCloud account folders, versus those on your mac. \nThe only thing you may see from this is some messages will be in your inbox for a very short period of time (before your Mac runs its rules), versus iClouds server side rules that process mail before its delivered. \n\nA: As said in: https://superuser.com/questions/113226/apple-mail-only-applies-rules-once-when-message-arrives\n\nTo apply rules to messages you’ve already received, select the\n  messages in the viewer window and then choose Message > Apply Rules.\n\nYou can select one email or All (⌘A) and then click ⌥⌘L (option+command+L) and all rules may be applied.\n", "Q: Can I direct the audio signal from Apple TV? I have the following equipment:\n\nI have all my music files stored in iTunes on the pictured iMac.  When I play music it follows a path from the iMac through the Time Capsule to the Airport Express.  The Airport Express connects by hard wires to a stereo power amplifier (that has no volume controls, selector switch, or additional connections available) and from the amp to the stereo speakers.  I control all of this directly from the iMac using the iMac's volume control.  This all works great and sounds great.\nAs the diagram also shows, I have an Apple TV that connects to the TV.\nIn our house we predominantly watch Netflix or other content via the Apple TV.\nI'd like to direct the audio signal from the Apple TV to the Airport Express and thus to the amp and speakers.\nI know I could put in an additional device and hardwire the TV's audio outputs, stereo amplifier, Airport Express into it (essentially use it as a  switching device), but it just seems that I should already have everything one really needs already.\nAny way to do this?\nFollow up...\nLooking at the suggestions offered and doing a bit more research on my own it seems like the easiest solution would look something like this:\n\nThis idea adds an analogue switch, which both the TV's analogue audio output and the Airport Express's analogue audio output (the Airport Express has a built in digital to analogue converter, DAC) run into.  The switch's output goes to the amplifier.\nThis solution depends on a few of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The TV's audio output has sufficient level to drive the amplifier.\n\n*The TV's volume control (from its remote) can adjust the level of its audio output enough that the speakers reach desirable listening levels -- both low enough and loud enough.\n\n*Nothing nasty happens switching between audio sources.\n\n\nA remote control for the switch would be nice.\nAny suggestions for such a device?\n\nA: I don't believe it is possible to send your audio signal from the appleTV to the Airport Express. You will need to use the amp as your switcher. \n\nA: Time to pick up a new receiver, or at least an external 2-port optical switcher (?) to put between the 2 Apple devices and the current amp.\nTo answer the follow-up question in the comment below, I can't recommend an optical switcher, but there are models out there.  This switcher seems popular, but double-check that it can handle both types of optical cables.  You might need an unusual one from the Airport Express to the switcher, but the ATV uses a fairly standard one.\n\nA: The Apple TV can replace the Aiport Express (for audio duties). I took this route and it works well most of the time as a drop-in replacement for the Aiport Express. I moved the Airport Express to the other end of the house to extend my Wifi network.\nBut you will need an extra bit of hardware, as your amp doesn't have optical in. You'll need a digital to analog audio converter (here's one on Amazon). They are usually $40-$60 in price.\n\nA: On the Apple TV , Go to Settings:\nAirplay:\nSpeakers:.....you should see your airport express as an option for wireless audio out\n", "Q: Is my MacBook Pro hard drive dying? I have an early 2011 13\" MBP, i7, 8GB crucial RAM, 500 GB Seagate ST9500325ASG.\nI've had it for about 4 months. Twice, including last night, the beach ball appears, concurrent with a sound that can only be described as a squeak, coming from, I assume, the hard drive. Then, the beach ball freezes and the machine can only be revived by a hard restart.\nThe cover is closed and I am using a keyboard and monitor. The Console shows nothing, no kernel panic.\nI have done some research, and this sound is not like those recorded on YouTube.\nI am at a loss. Is my hard drive on its way out? Should I be concerned?\nUpdate\nThe responses so far have all assumed that because the hard drive is making noise that it is about to dies. Is this really case? Has anyone had the same circumstance? Also, why does the computer freeze? Is this also a symptom of a dying drive?\nAnother Update\nI've made a video where you can hear the noise. This describes is much better than i can!\nFinal Update\nI cloned the drive using SuperDuper and replaced it. No further issues.\n\nA: Number one, backup immediately. At least if it dies you got all your data. I would recommend using a drive scanning utility to check your drive for hardware issues. S.M.A.R.T is useless, its pretty good that telling you that your drive is already dead. \nAll the really good utils aren't free. Techtool Pro has been my tool of choice, however its not cheap. \nWhile you're at it install Disk Drill to get temps for your drive make sure its not over heating and also get some recovery mechanism in place (other than time machine). The basic edition is free. You can grab it from here: http://www.cleverfiles.com/\n\nA: Is your computer still covered by warranty or do you have AppleCare? If yes, Apple will no doubt replace the drive for you at no cost.\nBut first get an external drive. Do a complete backup on it with a tool like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner.\nOnce done set startup so that the external drive starts up your machine.\nOnce you start up unmount (dismount) the internal drive which isn't running the show anymore. This should stop it from spinning.\nUse the external drive for a while and see if you hear the noise. If you don't hear it it's probably the internal drive and if the machine is under warranty you can erase it and let Apple replace it (with your good backup safely in hand). If your machine is out of warranty you can erase the internal and replace it with a new internal drive yourself, then format it and use SuperDuper or CCC to copy the backup back over it.\nStart up from the new internal drive and you're back in business.\nContinue backing up daily onto the backup drive.\nNote: The only possible problem with any of this is if the dying internal drive has some problem (bad) blocks on it that corrupt some of your data. As posted by others, it might be a good idea to test the data on both the internal (bad) drive and the backup after  you make  your first backup but before  you go through the process of erasing the internal, just to make sure you don't skip the step of attempting to resurrect data on it with a tool like Tech Tool Pro. This may not be necessary but without testing the data it's tough to know.\n\nA: The first thing to do in this situation is to use Disk Utility to check HDD S.M.A.R.T. Status. If your disk have passed S.M.A.R.T. test, then try to pass Repair Disk procedure. Otherwise it is better to backup all important information A.S.A.P.\nAnyway the fastest algorithm to change your suspicious hard drive is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the notebook bottom cover.\n\n*Remove your old HDD\n\n*Setup the new HDD\n\n*Close the bottom cover\n\n*Install the Lion (you could make a system update in addition)\n\n*Place your old HDD into external case\n\n*Use Migration Assistant to transfer your applications and data from the old disk\n\n\nAfter this you will have the notebook with a new disk and updated system, fully transferred personal account with your preferences and external HDD you can boot in case\n\nA: I have a late 2008 MacBook Pro, which made a similar sound just once. It also began freezing up, requiring hard restarts, and ultimately not starting at all. Apple replaced both the the hard drive and the logic board under warranty. It's painful, but soon you'll have your computer back and functioning better than ever!\n\nA: \nThe responses so far have all assumed that because the hard drive is\n  making noise that it is about to dies. Is this really case?\n\nYes. As half a dozen response said so already would already, 95% of the time the drive is about to die. \n\nHas anyone had the same circumstance?\n\nWe all have, I personally seen a hundred dying drives making all different types of squeaks and clicks.\n\nAlso, why does the computer freeze? Is this also a sympton of a dying\n  drive?\n\nThe computer can reactly to the die drive in many different way, because a dying drive can stop sending data or sent wrong data to the computer, the computer may either freeze, kernel panic, show you an error and continue to let you to work. It can be different everytime. The only common thing is the hard drive making strange squeaky/clicky noises while the computer stalls/freezes/crash.\nMaybe you only had it for 4 months and that's why you think the hard drive should be fine, but the symptoms you told us are CLASSIC dying hard drive symptoms. So please at least to get it checked before it's too late.\n", "Q: How can I replace the original AppleIntelCPUPowermanagementClient.kext in OS X Lion? I was playing around with Coolbook and stupidly enough deleted the two kernel extensions (kexts) without saving them to a backup location. \nHow can I recover just AppleIntelCPUPowermanagementClient.kext and AppleIntelCPUPowermanagement.kext without reinstalling my OS?\nThese files exist in /System/Library/Extensions/ and I am running OS X Lion 10.7.3 preferably. I have searched for these on internet downloads, but can't find any and wouldn't want to blindly trust them if I can't tell they are unaltered.\n\nA: The first thing you should try is installing the OS X Lion Update 10.7.3 (Client Combo). If that doesn't replace those files then you'd have to reinstall OS X over your existing install.\nHowever, since you're already messing around inside the System folder, you may be interested in trying to copy those files from your Recovery HD partition. To do this, you need to mount the Recovery HD, then mount the Base System image on it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the Recovery HD in Terminal with this command:\ndiskutil mount \"Recovery HD\"\n\n\n*Mount the BaseSystem.dmg with this command:\nhdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg\n\n\n*You can then try copying the files from the \"Mac OS X Base System\" disk image to your system folder. After copying, make sure the owner/permissions are correct (running Disk Utility's repair permissions would be a good idea).\nI haven't tested this, but the file sizes of each is the same in both the Base System image and the full install of OS X, so it seems likely they're the same.\n\nA: You should reinstall from your original media; it isn't legal for anyone to distribute those separately.\n\nA: I just checked and found both in the 10.7.3 combo update (in MacOSXUpdCombo10.7.3.pkg) , which is a 1.26 GB download - but legal. For handling .pkg see this answer.\n", "Q: What are the \"sleepimage\" and \"swapfile\" documents? I was using Disk Inventory X and found a file called sleepimage in /private/var/vm/ It takes up 4 GB! I also found numerous other files in the same folder called swapfile0 swapfile1, etc. What are they and are they safe to delete so I can free up space? (almost 10 GB)\n\nA: Those are part of the virtual memory system: swapfile* contains literally swap data, which is memory content that has been pushed out to disk.\nThe sleepimage is used for suspend and resume support; when the system hibernates, that is where the memory data is stored.\nDeleting either would cause significant problems: sleepimage is the same size as RAM, and would need to be recreated to sleep; the swap files are memory that is in use, and would cause serious problems to delete.\nIf you use less swap, the system will automatically deallocate those files, though, and free that disk space.\n\nA: swapfile0, swapfile1 and so on are swap files. You can sort of think of them like \"backup\" RAM. When your computer doesn't have enough RAM to accomodate the memory requests of all your programs (which is almost always, this is normal), it uses these files to \"write out\" part of what it had in RAM.\nThe sleepimage has a very similar use, except it's used only when your Mac hibernates/wakes up.\nDeleting any of the swapfile* files is likely to mess up your system, but you can safely delete sleepimage. However, it's kind of pointless, it will probably be recreated the next time you put your computer to hibernation. If you really want to delete it, you'd have to use sudo rm, since root owns the file.\nFinally, it's normal for the sleepimage to take up to 4 GB; it will usually take the same space as your RAM.\nEDIT You can delete /var/vm/sleepimage safely, but it will be recreated when you put the Mac to sleep. If you run sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0; sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage, the Mac will use a normal sleep mode (like desktop Macs by default) and it won't recreate /var/vm/sleepimage. See this post with more information. \n\nA: I just deleted my sleepimage and everything works fine, and to permanently prevent it from reappearing, follow the steps outlined in the comments of this article \nSummary…\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I safely delete sleepimage from my Mac?\n\n*Yes, you can remove sleepimage and it will just be created again automatically the next time your Mac is put to sleep. To delete sleepimage, type the following command into the Terminal:  \nsudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\nYou’ll be asked for the administrator password to gain access to remove the file, this is normal.\nThe sleepimage file is only needed for the safe-sleep function where your data is saved to the HDD before sleeping, if you want to permanently reclaim this disk space you can do so using the following commands in a terminal window.\nThis will revert your computer to the older sleep method, which will sleep faster and wake faster but does keep your data in memory during the sleep period.\nto check which mode is active\npmset -g | grep hibernatemode\n\nto change mode 0= old style sleep 3= new (save to disk style)\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\n", "Q: How can I set up Gmail on my iPhone 4S with Exchange?

Something is wrong with my Mac, as indicated (and still unresolved) in the question:\nWhat is the Sixth Step of MacBook Repair?\nOne possibility is that the main disk is faulty.\nDisk Utility reports that the disk permissions are corrected if I run \"Repair Disk Permissions\". I do this after \"Verify Disk Permissions\" says that:\nPermissions differ\non \"System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/.../UIAgent.nib;\nshould be -rw-r---r--; they are drw-r---r--.\nPermissions differ\non \"System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/.../MainMenu.nib\nshould be -rw-r---r--; they are drw-r---r--.\n\n(8 similar set of errors are reported)\nBut then if I once again run \"Verify Disk Permissions\", the exact same set of permissions are reported.\nDo I:\n\n\n*\n\n*call the disk unreliable and replace it,\n\n*reformat the disk (and reinstall OSX) hoping the bad sectors would\nbe flagged and avoided,\n\n*do something more nimble?\n\n\nExactly the same problem happens if I run Disk Utility from the OSX DVD.\nEdit\nIt's a bit annoying, but even after a partition/format/install OSX sequence, some permissions are incorrect out of the box.\nGroup differs on “Library/Java”; should be 0; group is 80.\nPermissions differ on “Library/Java”; should be drwxr-xr-x ; they are drwxrwxr-x .\nUser differs on “usr/share/collabd/webauthd”; should be 94; user is 221.\nGroup differs on “usr/share/collabd/webauthd”; should be 94; group is 221.\nUser differs on “usr/share/collabd/webauthd/locales”; should be 94; user is 221.\nGroup differs on “usr/share/collabd/webauthd/locales”; should be 94; group is 221.\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/zh_TW.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/zh_CN.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/ru.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/ko.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/nl.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/it.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/es.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/fr.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/de.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nPermissions differ on “usr/share/devicemgr/frontend/admin/ja.lproj/app/javascript.js”; should be lrwxrwxrwx ; they are lrwxr-xr-x .\nGroup differs on “Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf.plist”; should be 80; group is 0.\n\n\nA: Usually, you'd ignore the problem. It just means that contradictory permissions are specified for those files. It can't satisfy all of them at once.\n\nIn Mac OS X v10.5 or earlier, when you verify or repair disk permissions Disk Utility reviews each of the .bom files in /Library/Receipts/ and compares its list to the actual permissions on each file listed. If the permissions differ, Disk Utility reports the difference (and corrects them if you use the Repair feature).\n\nSource: About Disk Utility's Repair Disk Permissions feature \nThe problem here is that different receipts specify different permissions for a file. If it sets them one way, they're wrong according to the other.\nI think Apple used to mention possible contradictions in permissions, I'll see if I can find it.\nBut in your specific case:\nLooking at the specific permissions in your log, I doubt this applies to you. The d indicates a directory, which means a file has been replaced with a directory. Fixing permissions is not going to fix this; it can't transform the directory back to a file.\nI suspect this would be fixed with a reinstall. I doubt the disk needs replacing, however.\n", "Q: Re-colorize iTunes/iPhoto sidebar icons? I simply can't abide Lion's/Apple's dedication to monochrome sidebars everywhere in Lion. The SIMBL technique still works in the Finder, but the new 10.6 version of iTunes breaks all the previous hacks I've tried. What I'd love is to be able to edit the iTunes.rsrc file (and similar) myself but I don't know of any way to do that in OS X. Is there a way to edit (copies of) .rsrc files? Failing that, is there a way to change the depressing gray sidebar icons in iTunes 10.6? \n\nA: There's an app called Lion Tweaks that can do what you want (at least with the Finder icons).

We're going to be moving to Germany in a few weeks, so I visited AT&T today and asked them to unlock our phones.  They unlocked my Android device, but told me that \"Apple did not give [them] the tools to unlock iPhones\".  I had a little shouting match, but I got nowhere.\nI might be able to figure out how to jailbreak and unlock my wife's 3GS (v 4.3.5 8L1, BB  05.16.02 if that matters) but she's really hesitant to \"mess with it\".  I'd really prefer to be able to go through official channels.\nI found plenty of questions here about unlocking iPhones, but nearly all of them seem to be overrun with irrelevant answers about how other networks work.  I get the impression from other web sites that AT&T is a \"special case\" and flatly refuses to ever unlock any iPhone, for any reason, period.  Is this true?  Would I have better luck talking directly to Apple?  Do I have any recourse, or is this phone going to magically turn into an iPod Touch after our plane ride is over?\n\nA: Yes, I've unlocked 4 myself and helped family members and friends unlock another dozen.\nThe web interface is nice, but I also call them after 2 days if the unlock isn't done since most of the unlock requests are either processed rapidly or hung due to an error or mis-typing/missing entirely a digit or two. Once I get someone on the phone, the unlock usually is done the next day but I also follow their procedure and submit the web form first before bugging AT&T in person.\nSo, the process is straightforward andbutyou'll do well to triple check your IMEI and account details before submitting your unlock request. I've not had any issues by following the guide as published by AT&T - even when we purchased an AT&T phone second hand for a gift / spare phone while traveling internationally or for a young child to use as an iPod and occasional unlocked phone.\nHere is AT&T's knowledge base on their current unlock policy:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the eligibility requirements for unlocking iPhone? \n\nA: I went through the same process with a 3GS and an iPhone 4 when I moved to China last year.   With two phones at stake, I many spent hours searching and tried calling and visiting stores, but no luck.  \nUnless something changed in the last year, it's not possible. The good news is that you can unlock it yourself.\n\nA: I'm sorry, but no chance. We moved to Germany in September and our phone are not working here. T-Mobile cannot do anything. The good thing is, that the phones you buy over here are free to use all over the world after 2 years because the companies have to release them by law. Soooo, At&T is the problem, not Apple!\n\nA: You can always use the Gevey SIM. I had one with a ATT 3G when using IOS 2.0. I bought one in Hong Kong for about 20£.

I prefer to avoid running a 'cp -pR', but if you think I could get away with it, please mention the caveats.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem, which may be different to your problem because all the computers in my house share the same backup drive, and so there are lots of different backup files. \nMy problem (which I fixed) was that Migration Assistant couldn't see the backup drive, but it turned out that if I opened the drive in Finder, and then opened the '.sparsebundle' file that belonged to my computer, then all of a sudden the backup drive became visible to Migration Assistant and I could restore from backup.\n\nA: Apple's official suggestion is to turn off your firewall, so you could try that. Other alternatives are to make sure you run Software Update on both computers, and monkey some with Internet sharing, both of which are described in their official support article on Migration Assistant.\nI had encountered nearly this same problem, but on first time setup of a Retina MBP. Initially I thought your attempt to click the greyed out continue button was silly, but I learned my lesson when I was flummoxed by this screen:\n\nIt turns out that even though the \"Looking for other computers\" wheel is spinning, and even though the Back button is a tempting blue, and even though the Continue button is greyed out by comparison (a UI convention implying 'disabled' that dates back several decades), and even though there's a giant action verb (\"Select\") on top of the screen, and even though there's a large icon of your Time Machine volume that feels selectable, the intended user interface element for you to click here is the Continue arrow. Took me about 30 minutes and a couple dozen Google searches before I thought to try that.\nWhich I post only because there are tons (seven threads on Apple's forums in the past month, as of this writing) of people getting stuck at \"Looking for other computers,\" and I'm just hoping that a few of them are not in fact having the deep technical problems they imagine, but are rather merely as confused by this screen as I was.

I like the built-in time announcement in OS X.  But my wife has forbidden it because it announces time at night too.  Is there any way to silence during certain hours or some other utility that will announce the time?\nI am aware of Cuckoo, but it only does chimes.\n\nA: I would use applescript and iCal to schedule enabling and disabling this feature. On OSX Lion you'll need to have 2 scripts one to enable it and one to disable it. \nThis is the script to enable save it somewhere in your home directory I called it time_announce_on.applescript : \ndo shell script \"defaults write ./com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs TimeAnnouncementPrefs -dict TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool YES\"\n\nThen in iCal setup an appointment to recur every morning at the specified time you want to enable the announcements and have the alert 'run script' and load the above script. \nThen all you need to do is have the disable script which I called time_announce_off.applescript : \ndo shell script \"defaults write ./com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs TimeAnnouncementPrefs -dict TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool NO\"\n\nThen setup another appointment in iCal for the time of night that you want to disable this and have it run the time_announce_off script. \nI tested this in Lion 10.7.3 and it works. For 10.6 I believe you just need to remove the ./ from the beginning of the com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs (but I haven't tested this). \n\nA: Easy Fix Via Terminal, If That's Cool\nIf you're still having this issue, it's annoying, but here's a simple way as of Big Sur, in the Terminal:\nTurn \"Announce the Time\" On\nplutil -replace TimeAnnouncementPrefs.TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool YES /Users/macbook/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist; defaults read com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist;\n\nTurn \"Announce the Time\" Off\nplutil -replace TimeAnnouncementPrefs.TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool NO ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist; defaults read com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist;\n\nScheduling\nKeep it simple. Use crontab.\n#m      h       dom     mon     dow     command\n5       23      *       *       *       plutil -repla...\n5       7       *       *       *       plutil -repla...\n\nStating obvious, use the full line (on a single line) vs the ellipses... If you're not familiar with crontab, you can cheat and just use this site (or many others) to generate the full line for you.\nExplanation\nThe first line is an edit command using plutil in the terminal to edit the preferences in com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist.\nYou can use plutil to view the preferences in the terminal as follows:\nplutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist\n\n...which in Big Sur, shows...\n{\n  \"TimeAnnouncementPrefs\" => {\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsEnabled\" => 0\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsIntervalIdentifier\" => \"EveryHourInterval\"\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsPhraseIdentifier\" => \"ShortTime\"\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsVoiceSettings\" => {\n      \"CustomVolume\" => 0.1148504\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe TimeAnnouncementPrefs.TimeAnnouncementsEnabled is the BOOL switch we're toggling on and off with the -bool YES or -bool NO. I'm sure the other settings do something, but honestly, not enough time in the day. I'm simple... on switch/off switch.\nThe second line forces the Mac to reload that pref so you don't need to kill any apps or reboot. If you don't run the second command, the change won't take effect until you reboot or force kill it. (For the CLI folks, it's the Mac equivalent of source ~/.bash_profile when changing PATHs or aliases or whatnot.\nNote if you have the System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar -> Clock open in prefs when you do this, the UI will NOT reload to reflect the changes. Close Systems Preferences entirely (vs. arrow back) and reopen (don't save), and you'll see the change reflected. If you don't, the pref is still changed but you run the risk of saving over it.\n", "Q: Which service or application is responsible for Mission Control?

From a design standpoint - this process implements the Quartz Display Services.\nYou might not want to just kill that process since that basically logs you out, but it might be interesting to know if the issue you report persists over sessions or is more of an inadvertent triggering of the mission control view or is really a bug in the tracking so that your presentation layer things that this is really what should be drawn on your main screen currently.\n", "Q: How to move from Aperture to iPhoto What's the best way to import my Aperture library to iPhoto?\n\nA: There are no perfect solutions to the this. To maintain the full quality of the images in Aperture, your best bet is going to be exporting the Master files from Aperture, then re-importing them into iPhoto. \nIf you've done extensive edits to your images, you will also want to export versions of those files in the highest quality possible, and import those versions into your iPhoto library. \nAnother possibility—that I haven't fully explored—would be to export your Aperture library as a new library that uses referenced images (as opposed to managed) so that those images exist in an organized folder hierarchy on your hard drive. You can then import those images and keep some of your Aperture organizational structure. (This is unexplored by me because I've never used the referenced image option.)\n\nA: As of Aperture 3.3, iPhoto and Aperture can now open the same photo libraries, so no importing is necessary.\n", "Q: Is there a limit for devices where I can download my purchased apps? I'm thinking about renting an iPad for use. And I would like to know if I can put my password to download my apps every time I rent an iPad, or is there a limit?\n\nA: You can download any app and other media purchased with your apple ID to a new device - as long as you authorize your new device with that apple ID.\nThis is what the official Apple documentation says:\n\nYour Apple ID can have up to 10 devices and computers (combined)\nassociated with it. Each computer must also be authorized using the\nsame Apple ID. Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple\nID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID\nfor 90 days. You can view which devices or computers are currently\nassociated, remove unused devices or computers, and see how long\nbefore they can be associated with a different Apple ID from the\nAccount Information page in iTunes on your computer.\nLast Modified: November 14, 2011\n\n", "Q: Mac terminal shows 'null' for host name at the prompt I've got a new Mac and I've noticed on the terminal I get a null instead of some kind of name there before on my previous computer.\nLast login: Fri Mar  9 10:14:57 on ttys000\n(null):~ Macuser$\n\nI'm pretty sure thats not normal and occasionally it does fix itself!

Fixed it by following this trick\n", "Q: Can I frequently switch Apple IDs on my iPad? I had thought one couldn't upon reading the text on Apple's website, \"Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple ID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID for 90 days.\" Recently, though, someone has told me that is is indeed possible to switch as often as you want.\nWhich is the case? I'd prefer someone with firsthand experience.\n\nA: Yes - you can switch accounts on one device many many many times. Once you have associated that account with that device, it uses one of your 10 slots for the next 90 days. After then, that device doesn't count as a \"new device\" for your limited slots. \nThe text \"You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only once every 90 days\" appears twice in the current iTunes, Mac App, App Store and iBookstore T&C under two subsections:\n\n\n*\n\n*AUTOMATIC DELIVERY AND DOWNLOADING PREVIOUS PURCHASES - under the iTunes store\n\n*AUTOMATIC DELIVERY AND DOWNLOADING PREVIOUS PURCHASES - under the Mac App, App Store and iBookstore\n\n\nSo - if you take one of the many accounts that can exist on one device - only one account gets the \"automatic\" pushing of content purchases prior or elsewhere until the 90 day timeout expires.\nOther than that one restriction, think more about your account rather than the specific device. Accounts are intended for one person, so when you create it, you can't go and use it on 11 devices after the tenth new device your account hits, you need to wait 90 days from the first device to account pairing. \nIt doesn't matter what other accounts are on a specific device - its about your ID being used in the app store on multiple devices.\n\nFor questions like this here are some nice references:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Legal Index Page\n\nA: I was puzzled by that comment too, since from first-hand experience I can tell you that I am able to frequently switch between 3 different Apple IDs on my iPad and on my Mac. I switch maybe weekly for one reason or another.\nThere is a distinction between \"switching\" the active Apple ID and making new associations. My iPad is associated with all 3 of the Apple IDs I use, although I am the primary user of only one of them. On the rare occasion that I've had to associate a single Apple ID with two totally new devices, I haven't run into a 90-day limit.\n(EDIT: To clarify when I think I've violated the 90 day policy without difficulty, I bought a new iPad for my mother. We went through the process of creating an Apple ID for her, and buying a few apps. Then I switched over to my own Apple ID to download a few apps that I had previously purchased. Then I switched her back to her own ID. My interpretation is that I associated her device with two different Apple IDs without having to wait 90 days between associations.)\n\nA: Its more than easy to switch Apple ID's but to be able to download your purchases music is another story. I have a Mac Mini and my dad recently updated it so that Apple Music would be available. He then logged in to his user and created his Apple Music account. Now when I go on my user, I have tried to download some things that I have purchased from the iTunes Store, or even trying to make a track available offline from Apple Music and I am faced with the \"This computer is already associated with an Apple ID\" message.\n", "Q: Does GarageBand iOS 1.2 support AirPlay? Does GarageBand iOS 1.2 support AirPlay? I see reports from Google searches that AirPlay was added to an earlier version but had lag-related performance issues. With 1.2, I see no way to select audio output. If I already have a Jambox connected, GarageBand will use it, but so far I can't get it to use AirPlay.\n\nA: It's a Treasure Hunt!\nOn the iPad: \nClick the wrench icon to open the Settings dialog. One of the settings is AirPlay - Bluetooth.

It has magnetic power cord--the square one. \nAnyway, as soon as it turns on, there is the blinking folder icon with question mark. Safe-boot, single user... nothing will boot except the installation CD.\nHeres what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset NVRAM/PRAM;\n\n*Booted with CD; \n-- Repair Permissions: OK; repairs made\n-- Verified permissions: OK\n-- Repair disk: OK; repairs made \n-- Verify disk: OK\n\n*Tried to select startup disk: HD not available for selection\n\n*Reset NVRAM; reboot\n\n*Tried to select startup disk: HD not available for selection\n\n*Fired up terminal; HD is there, mounted, browsable, and all the files appear to be there. However, permissions seem strange (even after repair)--lots of 501's.\nQuestions\nIs there some way to determine if it is reparable with an HD swap? i.e. is there some way for me to determine it is not some other hardware issue? \nI had recently (a few weeks ago) added in some more RAM. But, since then, until a few days ago, everything was working fine. When strolling through some logs, I did see a reference to a missing NVRAM variable--but might have been the result of hot-swapping USB... Could an issue with RAM keep the startup disk from working?\nThanks\n\nA: The blinking folder icon indicates that the computer can't find a valid startup disk. Based on the tests you've performed, it may that one or more critical files was removed from the drive, but the screwed up permissions are indicative that something is screwy.  I would reinstall the operating system.\nIf there are files on the disk you want to save, copy them off of the drive onto an alternative volume before installing the OS.\n\nA: If you want to verify connectivity to the hard drive and you have a second Mac with Firewire. You could always boot your MacBook Pro in to Firewire Target disk mode, by holding down the T when booting it. Then simply connect it to another mac via Firewire and you MacBook Pro should mount as a hard drive on the other Mac. If the hard drive has not completely failed this should work fine, also allowing you to make backups of any data left on the MacBook Pro.\nYes it is possible that bad RAM could do this.  Eg in an example case of a read from disk of startup info,  store it in RAM, RAM corruption, then write corrupt invalid settings to disk, then machine fails to reboot.\nRunning the Apple Hardware Test or a Memtest program might not be a bad idea to verify the integrity of the RAM modules.\nAfter you do that then reinstalling OS X would be the best move.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 falling in water - issues after fixing Two months ago, I accidentally dropped my iPhone 4 into water (for 3 seconds or so). Immediately I turned it off and put it in a bowl of rice. After two days, I took it to a repair shop, in which it was dried and fixed (headphones didn't work after the accident).\nIt was \"fine\" after that, but since then I've been experiencing some weird issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPS isn't working well for navigation (can't seem to locate accurately, tell speed or direction).\n\n*When the battery is less than 1/4, it suddenly turns off. I have to wait like 10 minutes before turning it on again, and then it turns on normally.\n\n*The battery drains way faster than it used to.\n\n*A little blue stain has appeared on the screen.\n\n\nWhat I want to know is if it is possible that all these issues are related to the accident I had and if/how it can be fixed.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, even likely, that one or more of these issues was caused by immersing the iPhone in water. You should seek repair quotes from Apple or other repair sources, but you'll most likely find that replacing the phone is the most economical solution. Check Craigslist and similar places for people selling their iPhone 4's after upgrading to a 4s. \nIf you're of a DIY mindset, iFixit provides repair information, parts and tools for fixing portable electronics.\n", "Q: What does the \"4G\" that appears on my iPhone 4S's AT&T network indicator mean? Since upgrading my iPhone 4S to iOS 5.1 (from 5.0.1), the AT&T network status indicator now reads \"4G\" where it once read \"3G\". What has changed from the previous version? Does this \"4G\" mean the same thing as it does on the \"new iPad\"?\n\nA: Nomenclature\nThe terms 2G, 3G and 4G do not refer to a specific wireless standard, but a a whole bunch of different standards:\n\nThere has been controversy on what standards should be referred to as 4G. When Apple introduced the iPhone 4S, they followed other companies in referring to HSDPA as a 4G standard. HSPA+ is the successor to HSDPA.\n\nDC-HSPA+\nTechnically, HSDPA and HSPA+ are 3G wireless standards. However, HSPA+ has received technological upgrades which increased the theoretical throughput to become similar to that of LTE.\nIf 4G were to indicate speed rather than a wireless standard, it's legitimate to refer to the upgraded HSPA+ as 4G. However, this improved HSPA+ should be referred to as DC-HSPA+, not merely HSPA+.\n\n\nA: It means that you are connected on HSPA+. It's actually a 3G technology, and unfortunately, you probably won't experience any speed increase in downloading or surfing.\nThe 4G technology for the \"new iPad\" is LTE, and is much faster than the existing 3G band.\n4G iPhone On AT&T? New Network Indicator Causes Controversy \n\nA: The 5.1 update provides a labeling change for iPhone 4S users - \"3G\" is now \"4G\". As the other answerers have noted, HSPA+ is technically considered a 4G technology. A MacWorld article states: \n\nThe 4G label in iOS 5.1 instead reflects AT&T’s perspective, namely\n  that the carrier’s HSPA+ network (also known as Evolved High-Speed\n  Packet Access) qualifies as 4G technology. Carriers tend to refer to both HSPA+ and LTE—the cellular network technology built into the new iPad—as 4G, though the inner workings of the technologies are vastly different.\n\nThe new iPad, however, uses LTE, a different 4G technology. There's more information about the differences between LTE and 3G in this MacWorld article.\n", "Q: What does a \"o\" symbol instead of \"3G\" or \"E\" mean? \nPossible Duplicate:\niPhone data connection types \n\nI sometimes get a \"o\" icon instead of the \"3G\" or \"E\" icons when I loose my connection to the network. Why?\nCould this be due to a jailbreak?\n\n\nA: You are connected to GPRS/1xRTT since other network connection types are not available.\niOS 5.1 status icons\nOn GSM (All but Verizon):\n\n*\n\n*3G = UTMS/HSDPA\n\n*E = EDGE\n\n*o = GPRS\nOn CDMA (Verizon):\n\n*\n\n*3G = EV-DO\n\n*E = no equivalent - not possible\n\n*o = 1xRTT\n\n(iPhone User Manual on Page 12)\n\nA: It means you are using the slower GPRS connection. Probably because there's no 3G/EDGE connection or the signal strength for 3G/EDGE is very weak at your location.\nNothing to do with your jailbreaking.\n", "Q: hotspot stops being detectable I have an iPhone 4 and a MacBook Pro. If I turn 'Personal Hotspot' on my iPhone to on, then I can connect with my laptop fine and everything is great. \nIf on the other hand I then disconnect the laptop and leave 'Personal Hotspot' switched on, the signal appears to vannish after a while.  So if I come back later and try to connect my Mac to the network again, the Mac can't even see the network.\nIf I open up the settings on the iPhone and switch 'Personal Hotspot' off and then on again (good old technical training) the signal reappears and everything is fine. \nI'd like to be able to just leave the 'Personal Hotspot' available at all times because it's a extra bit of bother to switch it off and on again.  Can anyone suggest a fix or tell me what's happening here...? \n\nA: If your wireless client is a windows machine, try going to wireless settings , select your iphone's SSID and check off \"connect even if the network is not broadcasting its name (SSID)\" \n  I've noticed this same problem and oddly, If i have one device connected, I still have to open the hotspot screen on my phone in order to find the access point with a second device. This would indicate that the hotspot is indeed still active, but not broadcasting its SSID.\n\nA: Actually, this is what happens for hotspot.\nIf there is no active WiFi connection, and you're not in the screen that says \"Personal Hotspot\", it turns off WiFi hotspot feature completely.\nTo connect your FIRST device, you MUST be in that Personal Hotspot settings page.\nAfter that, it won't turn off until the last device is disconnected. \n\nA: The iPhone turns off its wifi after some inactivity. After you disconnect the laptop and the iPhone see no activity, the wifi connection is turned off and therefore you can't find the hotspot anymore. \nYou should be able to see the connection again once you unlock the iPhone from lockscreen. \n\nA: Two years later I can report that the only decent thing I found was the 'tether me' app for Cylia.  It has exactly the 'keep broadcasting' option I was looking for (although in practice it's generally worth tethering with a cable because it keeps the phone battery in a good state. \n", "Q: What are the differences between an iPod touch and an iPhone 4S? I see that the prices for the 64GB iPhone 4S and iPod touch are the same. \nBesides having a phone as well as the monthly data fee and Siri, which I see is on the iPhone 4S, are there any other difference between the two products that I may be missing?  It looks like both use the same version of iOS.\n\nA: The iPhone 4S has a much more powerful processor and better graphics performance. It's a dual core A5 processor, whereas the latest iPod Touch 4G still uses the A4 processor.\nYou will see a better throughout system performance and have the ability to play more resource demanding games. \nIf you're looking for my opinion about what to buy, I recommend you buy the iPhone 4S. After all: You can always use an iPhone as an iPod, but not vice versa.\n", "Q: iPod Classic 5.5 160Gb Euro Volume Cap I've just bought an iPod Classic 5.5, and the volume is too low.\nI have searched through google and, though i find a lot of people with the same problem, i can't seem to find a solution.\nand no, it's not the 'volume limit' option in the settings.\nDoes anybody know how to hack this?\nThanks\n\nA: Not loud enough for what application? I'd start by trying the iPod using different headphones because volume levels can vary greatly and, using earbuds with better isolation allow for lower listening levels. 20 years down the road your ears will thank you (by not ringing in an annoying way.)\nIf you can't find an acceptable pair of buds consider a portable headphone amplifier like the FiiO E5. It's available for $20 or so, and won't void your warranty. \n\nI just realized that you specified a Euro iPod so I will also link to software that claims to remove the euro volume cap. I can't verify or guarantee it's function, I don't have ready access to Windows computer or a Euro-market iPod for testing. Do your own research and apply this patch at your own risk.\n", "Q: Downgrade iOS 5.1 on my iPad to iOS 5.0 New version of iOS is out & I have upgraded my iPad to iOS 5.1 from iOS 5.0. I didn't realize that some other software will not work with iOS 5.1 so I would like to go back. How can I downgrade iOS version on my iPad?\n\nA: Apple is still signing iOS 5.0.1. You will need to download the 5.0.1 ipfw and then place your device into DFU mode. From there, hold the ALT/OPTION key as you hit the restore button in iTunes. Then point iTunes to the newly downloaded firmware. \nYou must act fast. When Apple closes this window and stops signing the old firmware, it will not be possible to downgrade iOS. \n\nA: Well there is not easy route to accomplish a 5.1 to 5.0 downgrade even if you were to have a backup from a previous version. The upgrade process is typically one way. By upgrading you essentially lock yourself out of downgrading iOS to an earlier version. This is due in large part to Apple imposed changes and restrictions in iOS 5. You can Jailbreak your iPad which does offer other avenues for downgrading but at present there is no route from 5.1 to 5.0 that I could find.\n\nA: You can downgrade an iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad From iOS 5.1 To iOS 5.0.1 easily, just follow the guide in this link.\n", "Q: Mac: back up to cloud storage or iPod I need to hand back my current MacBook Pro, and setup up a new one. What I want is to save my all user-specific data and, maybe, all the programs installed (not necessary).\nI believe it is possible, having an external HDD, setup a Time Machine to back up all my system to it. Yet I see this to be not the best solution: I don't have much time left with my current MacBook + I would like to lower my expenses as much as possible, solving this problem.\nSo my question is: is it possible to order, for instance, a non-expensive external dropbox-like storage and setup of Time Machine to use it? MIf not... I have a 80 Gb iPod Classic – are there any known cases of backing up the system to IPods?\n\nA: If you can have both machines for a period of time you can use Migration Assistant to copy your user directory directly from one Mac to the other.\nWhile an iPod can be used as an external disk practically speaking it's an expensive and somewhat delicate mechanism for doing so – iPods get very warm when used as data drives for extended periods. External hard disks are (by most metrics) cheap these days, and will generally be more reliable than the micro hard drive in the iPod.   My first choice for backing up to an external drive is SuperDuper!\nI don't know your definition of expensive but for offsite \"cloud\" storage, I recommend CrashPlan. You can pay for their cloud storage–50 bucks/computer/year for home use–or use the software for free to back up to local drives or drives connected to an offsite computer.\nTime Machine has its uses, and is definitely \"better than nothing\", but I use it for recovery of individual files and prefer these other solutions for transferring data to a new computer.\n", "Q: Is the 3G network used by the iPad the same as the 4G network used by the iPhone? Both my iPhone 4S and iPad 2 are running iOS 5.1. Both are AT&T models. When not connected to Wi-Fi, the network indicator on the iPhone shows 4G while the iPad shows 3G. Does the iPad use a different network? \nI'm not looking to stir up religious fervor over the semantics of 4G vs. 4G LTE. I'm just trying to find out if my iPad and my iPhone have the same data connection capabilities or not.\n\nA: iPhone 4S supports HSPA+, while iPad 2 doesn't.\nHSPA+ is technically not 4G, but is being advertised as 4G by networks like AT&T and T-Mobile in US. Pre-iOS 5.1, Apple wasn't calling HSPA+ a 4G network, but they have started calling it 4G now to match AT&T's other \"4G\" phones that are using the same signals and protocols as the iPhone.\nIf you are in HSPA+ supported area, you should hopefully get better speeds on iPhone 4S.\n\nA: The short answer is yes - the 4G on the iPhone 4S is merely a label change for AT&T's HSPA+ network. More info can be found in this Apple.SE question.\nFrom Apple's specs page for the iPad 2:\n\nWi-Fi + 3G for AT&T\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); \n  \n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n  \n\nFrom Apple's specs page for the iPhone 4s:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); \n  \n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n  \n\n\nA: They use the same network and speeds will vary depending on how AT&T allocates bandwidth.\nToo much is made out of theoretical speeds and not enough about actual, \"real world\" results. All carriers (and ISPs) throttle bandwidth depending on various factors (network congestion, area, population density, etc.). And you'll likely see no difference between the two devices in terms of network performance (or a negligible one). If you'd like to test the speeds, you can always download Speedtest.net Mobile (by Ookla), found in the App Store. But be careful how you interpret those results. Carriers are known to throttle data differently (for example, Bell Canada, at one time, throttled App Store downloads more aggressively than other data).\nAs for the badge, it is reflective of the device's technical capabilities. The iPad 2 was not marketed as supporting 4G speeds (unlike the iPhone 4S), which is why it does not present the respective badge. However, this is more of an artificial marketing strategy than an accurate measure of network performance, which as described above, will vary depending on many factors.\n\nA: Yes, the iPad 2 supports the same 14.4Mbps HSPA+ protocol the iPhone 4S does. \nT-Mobile markets 4G in phones with both either 14.4Mbps HSPA+ or 21Mbps HSPA+ as both do not have a substantial difference in terms of performance with current 3G network congestion in the US. \nOn my iPhone 4S I reached a high-5Mbps download speed while on my 4 it reached 3.5Mbps. Meanwhile on the AT&T Galaxy S 2 with 21Mbps HSPA+ I reached speeds of 5Mbps as well.\nThe new iPad on the other hand expands that to the 21Mbps HSPA+ and dual mode HSPA 48Mbps DC-HSPA+ along with 72Mbps LTE\n", "Q: Mac mini Mac OS 10.6 server migration to new hardware I have a Mac Mini with Mac OS X 10.6 Server installed.

I want to migrate to the new hardware (the new Mac Mini and the new hard disks). Can Migration Assistant do that for me or do I have to transfer the data in the external drive manually?\n\nA: Apple prepared a nice, long document listing the steps needed to prepare for and implement a migration from an existing Snow Leopard server to Lion server.\nHave a look and come back and ask more specific question if you run into any snags...\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion Server: Upgrading and Migrating For Mac OS X v10.7 Lion Server\n", "Q: How tough is the aluminum body of a MacBook? I had an older macbook with a plastic shell. I broke and replaced the screen several times  over it's lifespan.\nI now have a MacBook with an aluminum body and am really nervous about cracking the screen.\nShould I be that nervous? Have you seen an aluminium cased MacBook with a cracked screen?\nIs getting a \"MacTruck\" case overkill?\nUpdate: 20 months of use with a thin Speck case and no cracked screens.\n\nA: The unibody construction is substantially more impact resistant than the previous plastic design. This is especially true in the display area where the front glass and the rear aluminum act more like an I beam than the old design. Not only is the construction more sturdy, but in falls, the damage tends to be less expensive to repair should you actually break things.\nFor example, the unibody macs with enclosure damage usually cost between $300 and $400 to repair where a cracked screen can cost upwards of $800 to $1200 for an Apple repair. The unibody parts require better tools and training to repair inside them, so that's about the only down side I can see to the newer design. Aluminum is really much stronger than the old LCD panel with thin metal braces and a plastic shell to cover the display. Even the new macs with matte displays are much stronger than the old pre-unibody displays on MacBook Pro / PowerMac line.\nOf course, many single falls can break even the expensive parts in a unibody mac as the tolerances inside the machines leave little room for deformation to safely absorb the shock of a fall, but I have seen far more unibody macs that have skidded across pavement at highway speeds that still worked and had only surface damage than the previous generation of non-unibody macs. (Yes - it happens more than you might guess and when placed on the top of a car or truck, sadly they don't actually leave the vehicle until you get up to highway speeds. Now the ones run over by a following vehicle - unibody stands up better, but still doesn't usually survive that ordeal.)\n\nA: I have seen aluminum MacBooks with cracked screens, but I wouldn't say it's common and overall my observation is that the Apple laptops are as durable, often moreso, than anything other than an armored Toughbook.\nOf course, that doesn't matter if you're the unlucky exception so whether or not to use a heavy duty case is up to you but I wouldn't be overly nervous.  FWIW, I carry my own 2007 MacBook Pro–a more flexible chassis than today's unibody decks–naked (the computer, not the operator) within the padded Laptop compartment of my Tom Bihn or Patagonia bags.\n\nA: I had a MBP 13\" go down in a loosely bundled rack attached to my bicycle.  The MBP was enclosed in a Case Logic ~neoprene sleeve.  The exposed corner of the sleeve hit the pavement and the friction of aluminum-neoprene-pavement tore out a hole the size of a pencil eraser at one of the corners.  The MBP seemed to chiefly slide about 1 inch or so across the pavement and put a scrape at the battery-side of the aluminum unibody.  All internal components function without any problems. \nGranted, this was not on the screen-side... however, I think the result would have been the same, namely, minor superficial scratching to the case.  In summary, an arc-like fall from a 3 foot height, while cocooned in a neoprene case, caused no detectable functional problems.  Incidentally, it probably helped that the fall was not 'hammer-style', but rather, the impact was of the MBP landing at a 45º angle.\nYour mileage will vary.  I do not recommend running with the MBP in its 'open' configuration.  That's what caused my old HP to die a slow screen-related death.\n\nA: Out of maybe 100 Mac portables at my office over the last 3-4 years, I've only seen three that came back with significant drop damage, and only one of those caused display damage (and even then that was an intermittently blinking screen, rather than any cracks).  I am much more concerned with liquid spill damage.\nThat said, the Speck hard cases do seem to offer additional protection.\nPersonally I carry my MBP 15\" in the built-in padded sleeve of a Timbuk2 laptop messenger bag, and I bike with it fairly often..\n\nA: my macbook pro [ aluminum ] fell of the back of my ute onto the road going round a roundabout at 50 km hr and is still going year and a half later , it got a few dents in it but is still going trouble free  \n\nA: Get a black acrylic perspex (aka Lucite or Plexiglas) 5mm thick, the size of your laptop (more or less, I have 15\" mbp and perpex A4 size, i.e. smaller). Put the perspex on the closed laptop on the screen side, then keep the perspex in place with whatever, say, 3 rubber bands. Best protection I ever had.\nI have a sleeve, and I put the perspex in the sleeve on the screen side. Next laptop I'll build a perspex case. \n\nA: I have literally dropped the unibody MacBook Pro from a backpack that was not secured properly. The drop was against the edge of the MacBook so it dented the lid but the screen was perfect, including the glass front. So I ended up replacing the unibody enclosure for the screen by transferring to a new one myself.\n\nA: My Macbook pro 13 inch mid 2012 has fallen twice from my sofa and study on a the marble flow, the amazing aluminium body is able to lessen the impact and absorbs the fall, just causes a few dents, however screen and hardware works fine. \n", "Q: How does one upgrade a jailbroken iOS device? We have an iPad that is jailbroken and I'd like to upgrade it to iOS 5.1. What is the proper procedure for upgrading a jailbroken device? Do I have to back up the jail break data before upgrading? Or do I have to \"un-jailbreak\" it first?\n\nA: You will require iTunes. Connect the device, then right click on it in the iTunes side bar. Select \"Back Up.\" Allow it to runs its course. Close iTunes. \nThen put the device into DFU mode:\n1) Power off the device.\n2) Disconnect it.\n3) Hold the power button for 2 secs.\n4) Without letting go of the power button, press and hold the home button for 10 secs.\n5) Let go of the power button but not the home button for another 10 secs.   \nReconnect the device and launch iTunes. It will detect your iPad and inform you it is in recovery mode. From there, it will check for the newest available update (5.1), download it and install it. When that completes, simply restore your device from the backup you made earlier. \n\nA: I faced problem when I tried to upgrade my jailbroken iPhone to iOS 6:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep the iPhone in DFU mode\n\n*Connect it with iTunes.\n\n*Click on restore. This will do the rest.\n\n\nNote: Make sure you take a backup before heading this procedure.\n\nA: Just upgrade and do a tethered jailbreak with redsn0w 0.9.10b6 or the latest sn0wbreeze. That's what I did.\n", "Q: What Mac apps are capable of managing SQL Server databases? I'm looking for a Mac app that has capabilities similar to Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager. \nThe app should be capable of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create and administer SQL Server databases, objects, logins, users,\nand permissions \n\n*Define and execute SQL Server administrative tasks \n\n*Design and test SQL statements, batches, and scripts\n\n\nIs an app like that available today?\n\nA: Navicat offers a few products that can connect and manager a MSSQL Server. Their apps are available on the Mac App Store as well. \nI have used their MySQL edition, as well as their lowest-cost option, Essentials (I think they used to have a free version). \nWhile I haven't used it for all of the items you have below, it was great for some simple table management tasks. \n\nA: You may like SQLPro for MSSQL. (You can also get a trial at our website)\nThe app has a few neat features such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Syntax highlighting.\n\n*Intellisense.\n\n*Tabbed based interface.\n\n*Support for executing multiple queries at once.\n\n*Quick access to tables, columns and more.\n\n*Stored procedure execution.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer.\n\nA: Froq supports multiple databases including SQL Server. I have used this app for Oracle and really like it. Can't speak to specifics of SQL Server support.\nThe author is also very responsive.\n\nA: There is SQuirreL SQL which is cross-platform. It works great and supports so many data bases including SQL Server.\nIt's Open source and free.\n", "Q: Safari (5) or Mac OS X (10.6 Snow Leopard): Is past HTTP Post data stored? In either Safari 5 (history intact) or Snow Leopard, is there a way to view a sent HTTP Post request? A session expired and I am looking for the data that was posted (and lost).\n\nA: No. Post data is deliberately never saved.\nIt's the most common way to send private data to a server, such as passwords every time you log in. It will never be saved unless the server writes it to a database somewhere.\n", "Q: merging two Apple ID accounts/emails I had an ATT iphone and have changed to the Verizon iphone today. I wanted to sync my apps and google mail/contacts and was told that I had to connect with itunes and it would update.\nI opened itunes and plugged in my new phone. Itunes asked to login but would not recognize my password. I clicked the forgot password but I think the email it has was from my old company and not able to be received. Because I have work this weekend with an app I had on my phone, I set up a new account with apple ID to get myself the app for the weekend but now I have two apple IDs. All my purchased apps are on the applie ID that I can not find the password.\nHow can I merge these to email accounts into one that I can access my purchased Apps?\n\nA: Currently apple offers no way of merging accounts. They are rumored to be working on a solution.\nIn any case you will have to retrieve your Apple ID.\nThere are 2 ways to do that. You tried the email. the second being the security question:\n\nThe last resort would be contacting apple and trying to get them to change the e-mail address of your account (if you have a credit card attached to your account they might be able to authenticate you using this).\n", "Q: How can I get Mac Mail to allow repeat of delete key or backspace key (Snow Leopard) I'm trying to find a way to have Mac Mail allow me to press and hold\neither the \"delete\" key or the \"backspace\" key.  I'm on Snow Leopard\nwith a non-Apple keyboard.\nGoal: delete a lot of emails, easily.  (Yes, I could highlight them\nall and then press delete, but that takes LONGER than pressing/holding\nthe delete key would.)\nI'd swear it used to work, but it hasn't for the past few months. I press delete (or backspace) and the current email message is deleted. I continue holding the key down, and … nothing.\nYes, the these two keys repeat in other apps (e.g., Safari URL entry line, or Terminal, or TextEdit), so it's clearly Mail being too clever for its own good.  \nI've checked the Mail Preferences, and don't see anything pertinent.\n\nA: You might be able to find a high end keyboard that has hardware key repeat, but it'd probably be a high end mechanical switch keyboard and set you back a lot of money.\nInstead you should just learn to hold down shift-arrow key and then press the delete key at the end.\n", "Q: iPad Contacts app incorrectly formats telephone numbers Some time ago my iPad Contacts app has begun an odd behaviour of incorrectly formatting American telephone numbers. Instead of displaying \"(415)-123-1234\", for example, it displays \"41 5123 1234\". Even when I create a new contact on the iPad, the telephone number is forced into the same odd spacing pattern.\nI've checked all of the international settings I can find. I am set up for American telephone numbers, both on the iPad (General > International > Region Format) and on my Mac (System Preferences > Language & Text > Formats). On my Mac, the Address Book displays numbers with the correct formatting, and when I log into iCloud directly the numbers are also displayed correctly. Since the iPad syncs with iCloud, I'm surprised that the formatting isn't carrying over.\nI do spend a lot of time in England, so I have quite a few telephone numbers in the British format as well as lots in the American format. I don't recall having ever set the device to British standards, though, and manually entering the correct spacing and punctuation seems to have worked until recently.\nI've taken the iPad to the Apple Store and wasn't able to get a very helpful answer (though I haven't yet made a specific appointment for this at the Genius Bar). It's a fairly minor annoyance, but I thought I'd post the question on the off chance that someone can see an answer that I've not thought of myself.\n\nA: The phone number format is set in Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format.\nBut believe it or not, it seems like your carrier is actually able to override whatever you've got set there (on my WiFi iPad, changing the Region Format updates Address Book's format, but on my iPhone it doesn't have any effect).\nWhile researching it I saw some mention of Verizon fixing this issue by dialling *228, waiting for it to connect, then dialling 1 and waiting for it to disconnect.\nIs it a 3G iPad? Perhaps while you were in England, something got switched over.\n", "Q: Can not upgrade to iOS 5.1 When trying to update from iOS 5.1 I keep getting an error message reading \"unable to check for update, an error occurred while checking for a software update\". The update screen loads for a couple of minutes before showing this.\nHow can I upgrade to iOS 5.1?\n\nA: It turns out you might need to set your DNS server to 8.8.8.8 as I found out Here.\nTo change DNS settings, go to the Settings app and then pick Wi Fi in the left column. Tap the blue arrow that's on the right of your Wi Fi network name, and DNS should be an option, and you'll see a number like 198.0.0.1. Tap this number and change it to be 8.8.8.8.\nTry the update after changing the DNS setting (wait a minute as you'll have to reconnect your wireless connection) and the update should work now.\n", "Q: DVI to Thunderbolt? I'm looking into get a 27\" iMac, and I'm debating whether to get the 2010 or 2011 versions. With the 2010 version, I can use the iMac as an external monitor for my gaming PC with the use of a mini-displayport adapter.\nUnfortunately, the 2011 iMac doesn't support mini-displayport input anymore. The incoming signal MUST be a full thunderbolt signal. Unfortunately, there are no video cards for the PC that support thunderbolt yet, and probably not for some time to come.\nSo does anyone know of any adapters for converting a DVI signal into thunderbolt? I really want the upgrades from the 2011 iMac, but being able to use it as an external monitor for my PC is a deal-breaker, and that forces me down to the 2010 model.\n\nA: No there is not a DVI, Displayport, or even a VGA to Thunderbolt adapter available yet. \nIt looks like if such a device were to be made it would have to have a DisplayPort input, to work, or include active convertors for other legacy signals because DisplayPort is the integrated video signal with Thunderbolt.\n\nTo do this a DisplayPort to Thunderbolt adapter must be possible first, hence requiring a full Thunderbolt Controller with a Display port input. Since a device like this has not been built yet, but technically should be possible according to the double ended arrow in the diagram for the DisplayPort signal on the external controller, it should be possible for such a device to exist. \nIf an when built this would provide a true Thunderbolt signal including a DisplayPort signal and could meet Apples requirements for Target Display Mode on Thunderbolt equipped iMacs, however there is a gray area as highlighted below.\n\niMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) and iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011) support Target Display Mode via Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable (2 m) when the source is another Thunderbolt-equipped computer.\n\nSo how enforcing Apple is between the terms Thunderbolt-equipped computer and Thunderbolt-device would also factor in if this will work or not... \nSo at this point we are waiting to see if a Thunderbolt to DisplayPort device is possible, and if that device would be able to send a signal that a thunderbolt equipped iMac would accept while in Target Display Mode.\nAt this point its just to early to tell if adapters will be available. So yes avoid Thunderbolt iMacs if you want to use Display Port - Target Display Mode, or buy a external Display to share between your PC and Mac.\nI wold say external display for the Win, Win case!!!\n\nA: It seems you may connect thunderbolt peripherals to display port devices.\n2011 MacBook Pro and after to LED Cinema Display.\nBut not the contrary. pre 2011 MacBook Pro to Thunderbolt display.\nhttp://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20043524-263.html\n\nA: UPDATE: I've since learned what I originally wrote (struck out section) is wrong.\nAs far as I know only the 2010 iMac can be used in target display mode. You can't do it with any other iMac (or any other mac).\nEven if/when you can get a PC with thunderbolt support, you still won't be able to use the 2011 iMac with it, or (probably) any future iMac model.\nPerhaps you should get a mac mini, or a second hand/old mac pro, and a 27\" display from someone else? I've had a 30\" Dell for years, originally plugged into a PowerMac and now a Mac Mini, and soon either another Mac Mini or a MacBook Air. It's worked out great for me.\nThere is nothing special about the iMac's display. Apple doesn't make their own LCD's and several other manufacturers get theirs from the same factories as Apple.\n", "Q: Alarms not working for iCal calendar synced with Google account I have, in iCal two accounts: one local, one synced with my Google account. In the last 3 weeks or so, the alarms on the synced account have stopped working -- that is, I'll create an event, set the alarm, and click \"done,\" and when I click on the event immediately after, my alarm settings have disappeared. This also happens when I add an alarm to existing event on this account. The alarms on my local account appear to be working fine.\nI am running 10.6.8 on a 15\" MacBook Pro.\nHas anyone else had any problems like this? Any ideas as to how I could about fixing it?\n\nA: On snow leopard I find that iCal drops alarms of type \"message with sound\", which I assume is because google calendar doesn't support them. It works ok for me with alarms of type \"message\". Could that be your problem?\n\nA: Yes!!!  I have exactly the same problem. It worked all the time and a few weeks ago it stopped working :(\nI found something which does not work for me but eventually for someone of you:\n\"Mike Riordan\nRe: iCal - alarm problems after upgrading from Tiger to Snow Leopard.\n11.03.2012 09:27 (in response to Robby W)\nI've been having the problem with no alarms in Lion and have finally resolved the problem.  The suggestion to check preferences and the disable the alarms checkbox, it's not the only one.  I have found that each calendar has the ability to disable it's own alarms.  To check this, pull down the calendars and control-click the calendar that has your alarms.  Then select \"Get Info\".  You'll see that there's a disable alarms checkbox for each calendar.  That was selected and fixed my problem,\nI think this got checked when I was trying to set up sharing.  One of the sharing option was to disable alarms.  I didn't want my alarms going off on someone else's iCal, so I checked it.\"\n", "Q: iPad app to gesture control PC I am looking for an iPad app that allows me to map gestures to keyboard buttons and then pass these along to my PC. The idea being that I want to control Windows Media Center with gestures. So a swipe up would be the up arrow, something else the enter key, etc.\nI am not interested in a full RDP client, I just want to send keypresses to my PC. \nMy google-fu and appstore-fu are failing me. \n\nA: Not sure whether they will do exactly what you want, but HippoRemote or Mobile Mouse should be worth a look, and both have (at least some) support for multi-touch trackpad and gestures. Both have Windows servers and should work on the iPad too.\nHippoRemote actually has a dedicated profile for controlling Windows Media Centre, so unless you specifically want to use gestures, this might be the way to go.\n \n", "Q: Using a Mac Mini as a central photo repository Is it possible to setup a mac mini as a central photo repository and have all the tagging and extra info follow to the other computers on the network? Or would each computer have to access iPhoto on the mini or have their own index?\n\nA: With the way that iPhoto is built it would be quite difficult to share the library across computers. We have had some success with having an aperture library sit on a network share and have multiple installs access that library but not simultaneously. If you want central I'd suggest something like picasa web from google. That way all machines can access the existing stuff and also contribute to the main repository. \n", "Q: Movies sometime lag on my 15\" MacBook Pro (2011) I've been having this problem for a long while and I've been looking around for a solution. And I found a very similar question explaining my very same issue. I edited it so I can give you all more details. Unfortunately, I don't know how that's going to work. So I decided to post it again in a new question hoping for your help. \nI have a new 15\" MacBook Pro with the highest specifications, running Lion version 10.7.2. However, when I watch movies they sometimes lag on my computer: frozen screen (for 3-4 s) with lots of broken cubes and with the audio track still playing). What could be possibly wrong with my computer?\nFor example, today I watched the Fast Five Blu-ray movie (which is almost 50 GB) with the VLC media player and suddenly it started lagging on some episodes (especially on intense action ones with lots of special effects). Moreover, it lags not only on Blu-ray movies but also on movie files ripped from standard definition DVDs and other formats as well.\nI play all those movies with the power plugged in from downloaded files, not from optical DVDs. Even Stanford University lectures from iTunes sometimes lag for me.\nUPDATE: I was in the Genius bar several times, reinstalled Lion on my own and also in the Apple Store.\nAfter the fresh install I tried to test videos. I watched House, M.D. season 8 episode 2 (395.9 MB) yesterday, and it started lagging all over again. I do not really know what to do. Is this a bug in VLC, iTunes, and other media players, or it is something wrong with my hardware? (They actually tested my Mac in the Genius bar with their cable plugged in but did not find any problems.)\nI've also tried using different software like Movist and Miro but I still have the same problem. It almost always happens on intense scenes but when I rewind it and play that same scene over and over it works eventually! So I don't think the problem is from the movie file itself. I noticed a few things though:\n\n\n*\n\n*It happens with YouTube videos as well, regardless of the browser used.\n\n*It NEVER happens with I connect my computer to an external screen via HDMI cable.\n\n\nI had an issue playing HD videos on my older computer and it's the main reason I bought this MacBook Pro. So you can see why this issue is very frustrating to me.\n\nA: I had this same problem and had already installed perian as suggested above. This seems to be a frequent problem, I've had read the explanation but it's a long time ago so don't ask me anymore what the cause is.\nI fixed it with 'Niceplayer' this player can preform a pre buffer. So if you load in a large mkv file for example with nice player you'll see a small white line going across let the loading complete (goes fairly quick) and press play. No more lag :) at least for me.. Hope it'll help you too...\n", "Q: MBP'13 (Late 2011) Win7 (BootCamp) + iMac'27 (Mid 2011) as an external display? Is it possible to use iMac'27 (Mid 2011, MacOS) as an external/target mode display for the MBP'13 (Late 2011) running Windows 7 in Bootcamp?\nI'm using thunderbolt cable.\nIt works perfectly fine if MBP is booted into Mac, but Win7 can't seem to detect external display. Command + F2 on the iMac does nothing.\n\nA: Yes. You have to reboot the machine into boot camp with the display already connected. \nSee apples KB article here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924 (bottom of the article)\n", "Q: How to install an OSX application from source I'm trying to install this application from source.\nhttp://sveinbjorn.org/platypus\nIt's not installed the same as the usual way in Linux. I got the source and built in in X-Code.\nNow how do I install it into my system?\n\nA: Well...you could just download the compiled version. Then unzip it and move it to your applications folder.\nBut if you want to compile it yourself, that's fine, too. Once you built in in XCode, the built product will be in the Development folder (or the Deployment folder, depending on which build configuration you chose). Be sure to build the correct target. To build the Platyups.app, you want the Platypus target.\nOnce you built the app, you can run it from right there. Or move it to your applications folder.\n", "Q: Safari: \"JavaScript error detected!

Quite frequently the shortcut to \"select previous tab\" in Safari does not trigger. Unfortunately, I've not been able to see a pattern of when this happens. Restarting Safari usually (always?) helps.\nThe shortcut is ctrl+⇧+⇥.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can  troubleshoot this problem?\n\n\nA: I've never experienced this in Safari, and I expect there is some sort of conflicting shortcut. Either that, or \"quite frequently\" your mouse focus is in Flash or Java, and shortcuts aren't being sent to the browser (which doesn't seem terribly likely given the frequency).\nDue to having switched to Safari after several years in a row of using Chrome and Firefox, I've set the Previous/Next Tab commands to ⌥+⌘+←/→, using System Preferences. Again, I've never had any issues with switching, so I'd suggest (if you're willing, and can't find the source of the problem) to set it to another shortcut you can remember.\n", "Q: Define order of label color in Finder I have ordered labeled PDF files with the colors green (very good), orange (ok) and red (bad).

These errors do not occur at the login screen right after boot. They appear only when the auto logout is triggered.\nI wonder if it's a hardware bug.

I have a AMD Radeon HD 6490M (early 2011).\nQuestion\n\n*\n\n*What causes this bug? (hardware? software?)\n\n*What measures should I take?\n\n\n\n\nA: Problem solved\nIn System Preferences > Energy Saver the timers for display sleep and computer sleep must be greater than the time of auto logout after inactivity in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.\n\nA: I don't get automatically logged out (or at least none of the settings to do so), no file vault, etc, but I have just started to get this; from yesterday afternoon and over night this has started to happen.\nI upgraded to Mountain Lion about 1 month ago (followed by Parallels Desktop and a couple of other things) and haven't (so far as I know) installed any new software since then. At least I have not had to enter my password to install anything.\nRunning an iMac with AMD Radeon HD 6970M.\nI put it to sleep and turn off my magic mouse, as always.\nThen after \"some\" time the system wakes, I am logged out, the system has no mouse connected so shows the message and I get a screen with my (logged in) desktop and the redraw behind the cursor (once my mouse it turned back on). I can then log in.\nIt has always turned itself on or made odd noises but only very occasionally and has never logged me out before.\nI guess I need to find whatever it is that is logging me out whilst the system is asleep and sort that out!

I have set it up to send me E-Mail when an appointment is imminent.\nI connected the calendar with my new MacBook Pro's iCal.\nNow, both Google Calendar and iCal want to send me E-Mail notification. Google through their online service (which is what I want) and iCal through Mail.App (which I don't want).\nI can't find any settings in iCal to turn E-Mail notification off. How do I prevent iCal from creating E-Mail reminders?\n\nA: To avoid getting double email notifications for appointments, you can turn off the alerts for the Google Calendar on the Mac as described in the Calendar User Guide:\n\nTurn off alerts for a calendar\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In the Calendar app  on your Mac, Control-click the name of the calendar [your Google Account name] in the calendar list, then choose Get Info.\nIf you don’t see the calendar list on the left, choose View > Show Calendar List.\n  \n*Select “Ignore alerts,” then click OK.\n\nNote that this will turn off all alerts for Google Calendar that would be created on the Mac, that is, not only email notifications, but also notifications in the Notification Center.\n\nA: This appears to be an event by event basis. If you click on a particular event and select edit, in the Alert drop down menu there are several options - one of which is email. I'm guessing, that in your situation, all or most of your events are set to email you.\nTo fix that, you could either change all your events, or, if you would like to turn all notifications off, open iCal settings, click on the Advanced tab, select Turn Off all Events. This should disable even email alerts.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of the high pitched creak and squeak noises in the unibody Macbook Pro? The unibody Macbook Pro makes disturbing creak noises when I move it around on my lap - or when I apply pressure to either the top or bottom of the case.\nHow else can I eliminate the click noise? What is causing them?\nI've applied insulating tape at places of the RAM slot which I had manually upgraded. However, the place where these noises originate from are spread out over the whole left side where the logic board and battery are located.\n\nA: I'll list some general things to check in the order I would isolate them.\n\n\n*\n\n*The bottom case itself is bent slightly compared to the frame (you should see wearing of the cases and brown dust where the parts rub)\n\n*The plastic clips that hold your bottom case to the topcase are bent, not engaged, loose or damaged.\n\n*A screw is not seated and rubbing. (and replace screw with cable, connector, lever, or cage - all of them are in there)\n\n*Foreign debris came in from the exhaust vents and is stuck between parts where normal flex is causing a noise.\n\n*Fan or blower bearings (unlikely - but I've seen/heard them make the darndest noises some times)\n\n\nA great place to find pictures of your model is the iFixit repair guide - I'll use the Early 2011 15\" iFixit guide for some tips below:\nLook over your bottom case very carefully - you should see wear marks or fine dust or scratches where it is hitting the insides. If the noise is coming from the bottom case contact - you should see physical evidence of wear. If not, then focus on the other parts (fans, hidden debris stuck under the battery, board or other parts near the keyboard side of things, etc...)\nIt's probably from the bottom case, so look at all potential contact points where the bottom case can rub. When putting the bottom case on again, remember where these inserts are so you can press them and hear a click for each before screwing the fasteners. When open, inspect the clips very well - a broken clip or not getting the insert into the snap is a big cause of the bottom case moving around when in use.\n\nSimilarly, pay attention to the clearance between the battery indicator, keyboard ribbon ZIF socket and trackpad connector cage as well as the clips under the left hand side of the mac. Even a battery screw could be too high and scraping the case. Once you have exhausted the easy things, you may even need to remove and re-seat the components on the left hand side of the mac to ensure nothing is stuck under the topcase and between the components.\nUnless you are a very good tech and know what things cost should they break, it might be better to take it in for service - especially if you can show the tech how to reproduce the noise. There are so many components, any one of which could be harboring a loose screw or piece of debris that made it's way in the heat exhaust vents - it's hard to guess what exactly is making your mac squeak.\n\nA: Following @bmike's advice I carefully studied the back cover for wear marks. Then I took a close look at the logic board without touching it.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the whole logic board you'll find tiny elastic sticks. They can be pushed a little. These sticks hold the aluminum bottom off the logic board.\n\n*If you include the parts from the RAM module there are in total 14 (!) of them.\n\n*I did not take any chances, therefore I applied insulating tape on every place of the aluminum bottom that the sticks can contact. Also I did not want to open the cover multiple times :)\n\n*Apply the tape again as it easily wears out.\n\n\nYour're done!\nThe Macbook Pro does not make any of the previous mechanic noises anymore.  It feels like a solid aluminum brick on my lap.\n\nAnd a close up...\n\nThis is what the back cover looked like when I was done. Uh, it's ugly! I'm glad it's on the inside.\n\n\nA: The click noise you're hearing is probably the hard drive parking its heads to protect the drive platters. \nTo test this, simulate dropping your laptop while holding onto it or drop it a short distance onto a very soft surface (onto pillows on a couch or bed). The drop only needs to be about 6-12 inches. When the accelerometer realizes the computer is in freefall, it'll park the drive heads and you'll hear a click. If this click is the same as the one you're hearing now, the hard drive protection mechanism is the culprit. This is not a problem, as it's a protection mechanism built into the laptop.\n", "Q: Turning off ambient light control? I have a mid-2011 27\" iMac. I have realized that the screen brightness adjusts depending on the ambient light. When the sun hides behind the clouds, and the room gets darker, the brightness decreases. I have located the sensor to be the camera. When putting a finger over the camera on top of the screen I can reproduce the sun hiding.\nHow do I turn this magic feature off?\n\nA: System Preferences → Displays → Automatically adjust brightness\n\n\nA: In System Preferences, go to the Displays section, under Hardware.

In other words, if you have a hierarchy of a main folder, Pictures, then underneath you have folders (for example) Family, Vacation, and Wedding, and you only want to display Family, and Vacation, there would be no way to do that. I think the simplest would be to create a folder with all the images you want on your Desktop/Screensaver.\n\nA: I found a way!\nYou can use the terminal ln -s command to create soft links from all of the folders you want into a single folder.\nFor example, if these 3 directories have wallpapers located in ~/images1, ~/images2, ~/images3, and you want to use all of them as your wallpapers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a wallpaper directory somewhere: mkdir ~/wallpapers\n\n*Create soft links of all the images from the 3 directories to the ~/wallpapers directory: ln -s ~/images1/*.jpg ~/wallpapers/, for one.\n\n\nThis isn't a real copy, since you're creating soft and not hard links. It'll barely take any space on your hard-drive.\nThere's a small catch, though: If you add new wallpapers to the directories, you need to link them manually. However, I believe this can be automated using AppleScript or Automator.\n\nA: I slowly built a terminal command through trial and error and some Googling, exactly for this purpose. It will take all JPGS from a folder and it's subfolders and create symlinks in another directory which you will use to give to the desktop wallpaper chooser.\nBe sure both directories exist first.\ndirPictures=\"/path/to/pictures\"\ndirTarget=“/path/to/symlinks/folder    \nfind \"$dirPictures\" -type f -iname \"*.jpg\" -print0 -exec ln -s {} \"$dirTarget\" ';'\n\n", "Q: Browsers unable to connect to Internet, other apps can, Parallels can This has been happening in the last few days: Chrome or Safari on the Mac (OSX Lion/10.7.2) are unable to connect to the Internet.

What is this and can I get rid of it?\n\nA: Probably a bit sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut, but if its happening fairly regularly and you can't figure out what's creating it another way, you could start a terminal prompt and leave the following command running\nsudo opensnoop | grep -i app.log\n\nThis will monitor for app.log being created and tell you the process that created it (I'm assuming there won't be that many processes creating a file called app.log, but I guess you could narrow it down to /Applications if you wanted to). At least then you'll be armed with the knowledge of what is creating the file and can potentially do something about it.\nFor example, whilst running the above command, if you type\ntouch app.log\n\nin another terminal tab or window, the original one running the opensnoop command displays\n501  10576 touch          3 app.log              \n501  10099 mdworker       6 /Users/binarybob/Documents/app.log \n\n\nA: Ok guys I just found out what is generating this file.

If it's because of a UID or UUID mis-match, what's preventing recreating this problem (perhaps in reverse) in the future?  If you can risk damaging the live machine I'd rather change Bob's UID and UUID on the live machine than on the backups, on the theory that there are probably other UUID mis-matches lurking on other disks.\nIn any case, scary as it is, if I were to try to fix I'd use the Finder if it were just a few folders that could be fixed with \"Apply to enclosed items...\".  If that was impractical, next thing I'd try would be to find files owned by whoever currently owns Bob's stuff and change only those files.

My internal network is running over a WNDR4000 wireless N router with WPA2 encryption. I have recently installed the Apple remote App to my iPhone 4s running iOS 5.1. In trying to control the playing of music within iTunes with the remote app I have experienced less than adequate results. The app seems to become \"stuck\" for lack of a better term trying to switch to different tracks within iTunes. Eventually it will switch to a selected track after 3+ minutes. I have turned off encryption as an experiment to see if this will allow the app to switch to a selected track more rapidly (i.e. within seconds) with no success. The wireless router is running latest firmware. I am highly skeptical of this  issue being a result of my wireless infrastructure and am more prone to see this as a result of the size of my iTunes library. I ran an additional test on my late 2011 Mac Book Pro (i7,Lion,8GB Ram, SSD) with a much smaller iTunes (v10.6) library (less than 2 gigabytes) over same wireless infrastructure with WPA2 encryption enabled and play back from app on iPhone was as would be expected, music selection from app was near instantaneous. My question is as follows:\nHas anyone experienced a similar issue when trying to use the app on an iPhone in conjunction with a large iTunes library running on a Windows 7 64 bit PC? If so was any workaround isolated?\nI have searched Google and the Apple forums but was unable to find any reference to a similar instance.\n\nA: Doesn't surprise me at all. An iPhone doesn't have anywhere near enough memory to work with that much data unless the developer puts a huge amount of effort into making it work, and I can't see Apple doing so when few people have a database that big.\nMost likely it can only store info about a small subsection of your library on the phone, and whenever it needs to access data from a song it doesn't have, it has to go back to the server. I could see that maxing out a fibre channel network's bandwidth, let alone wireless.\nAbout all you can do is send an email to apple's support team and ask them to fix it in some future update. If enough people complain, they will.\nHave you tried working with playlists that only expose small sections of your library?\n", "Q: Return Mac permissions to factory defaults? I messed up -- and followed some internet advice a few days ago without totally understanding the ramifications.  Specifically, in trying to stop the Finder from asking me to verify every time I wanted it to move or delete a file, I went to my home directory, looked at its permissions in Info (Read/Write for me, Read Only for Staff and Everyone), thought that looked like what I wanted everywhere, so I then selected \"Apply to Enclosed Items\".\nI've recently realized that I probably shouldn't have done this, as various things have begun failing at an accelerating clip.  Yesterday, iTunes refused to back up my iPhone and iPads; and ClipMenu started reporting that it can no longer save my clipboard history (not a huge problem, but a good example). Today many of my preferences no longer work, and I can't set/save them (e.g., Mail \"forgot\" my password and can't seem to remember it when I set it, Finder preferences don't stick, etc.).\nSo ... is there a way to reset the various file and group permissions back to their original settings?  I've tried Disk Utility -> Verify (and Repair) Disk Permissions, followed by restarts, to no avail.  Note that I'm obviously not a guru and not nearly as smart as I'd hoped, so any help you can give probably needs to be \"dumbed down\" a little.\nThanks,\n  Ed\nP.S. BTW, in regards to preference problems, one message I get is 'Group differs on “Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf.plist”; should be 80; group is 0.', which goes away after the repair, but comes back again after I've tried (and failed) to change a preference.\n--- EDIT ---\nThe \"problem\"may not be permission-related at all, but a corrupted keychain!\nI used the Keychain Access utility to verify and then repair (eventually, after several attempts) the keychain, and all of the symptoms seem to have disappeared, for now.  I don't pretend to understand any of this, but I'm glad it seems OK now.\nThanks to all for their patient and thoughtful replies.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you're attempting to reset the permissions on a user's home directory. This is easily accomplished by resetting ACLs on the desired home directly by using the Reset Password Utility in the Recovery Partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer from the recovery partition (if running Lion) or the gray disk (if not running Lion). \n\n*Open Disk Utility and run a permissions repair on your startup volume. After this is complete, close Disk Utility. We're doing this just for good measure.\n\n*Open Terminal from the Utilities menu. Type in resetpassword and select your user account (NOT System Administrator/root) from the drop down menu. \n\n*Click the Reset button at the bottom of the window in the Reset home folder permissions and ACLs section. \n\n*Quit the Password Utility and go back to the main recovery screen. \n\n*On your keyboard, hit ⌘ + Q and restart your computer. It's very important that you don't hold down the power button to exit the recovery session, or the ACL reset won't occur.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Have you backed up your home folder via Time Machine or other back up method? If so, you could try restoring your home folder to its previous state that way. Another possible solution, though less likely to work but definitely worth a try, is to go back into your Home folder's info window. Access that same drop down menu you used to apply changes to enclosing items, and you'll see an item that reads \"Revert changes.\" If it's grayed out (like in the photo below) then no dice. If it's not grayed out you may be able to restore the permissions this way. Again, a long shot but worth a try before you resort to backups.\n\n", "Q: How to setup Indian rupee format in Numbers? Indian rupee number format is different from US number format. \ne.g. 1,00,00,00,000\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee\nHow do I setup a custom number format in Numbers?\n\nA: You didn't mention which version of Numbers you were using.  Here are general directions to create a custom cell format in both Numbers '08 (1.0) and Numbers '09 (2.0).\nIn Numbers '09, once in the Custom Number Format dialog, drag a few integer elements into the format box.  Pull the menu down for each, and choose Hide separator.  On the appropriate groups, change the number of digits to two.\n\nIf you're not mixing with USD and prefer India's conventions, a much simpler approach is in the Language & Text panel of System Preferences.  Choose India from the Region menu, and any cells set to Currency format will not only have the correct symbol, but the correct groupings.  Of course, then if you want USD formatted correctly, you'd need a custom format for that - so use whichever region is most appropriate to the bulk of your content.\n", "Q: Pages on iOS custom paragraph styles & templates? On Pages 1.6 for iOS, is there any way I can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the paragraph styles in the document to custom ones\ni.e. The default 'blank' template has Helvetica as the body style. Can I change the body style to, say Helvetica Neue Light? Or the colour of the Title style?\n\n*If so, is there any way to add this template to the list of provided templates (possibly using something like iExplorer to copy it over)?\nBeing able to just change paragraph style is good enough, and I think it would be a bit hard to satisfy point 2, what with Apple's lock on the iOS filesystem. My current solution is to create the templates in Pages on Mac, and copy them over, then create a new document by copying from iTunes every time I need to use a custom template.\nEdit\nIf it's not clear from the above, I'm more interested in a solution to point 1 to point 2. It's point 1 for a reason. I already have a half solution to point 2, so I don't really need any further half-solution answers for point 2.\n\nA: You can create a symlink of the actual pages template directory on your Mac in your Dropbox so that you don't have to maintain two copies of your templates, and then use Dropbox to open the template files in Pages to make a new doc based on the template. \nThough template files are saved as .template, Pages for iOS still opens them correctly. You can create the symlink with the following command:\nln -s ~/Library/Application\\ Support/iWork/Pages/Templates/My\\ Templates/ ~/Dropbox/Pages\\ Templates\n\n\nA: It's probably not an ideal solution but storing the template you need in something like dropbox and then opening it from there works reasonably well for me. \n", "Q: How can I use an Apple remote control with customized actions without having the button actions happen? I want to use a white plastic Apple remote with BetterTouchTool to control Safari, but while it works, the default button actions (e.g. skip, volume up) still happen. How can I prevent this?\n\nA: I've been looking for a solution to this for a long time everywhere. That is discussions.apple.com, various popular technology websites and mac forums. The only real solution that I've seen is a piece of software by Twisted Melon.\nMira: Remote Control any Mac\nThis applications rests in the system preferences and customizes the apple remote buttons on a per-app basis. You can download and try the software from their website.\n\n\nA: Remote Buddy will allow you do to this (plus a whole lot more if you wish). You can customise a range of actions for each application and assign these to the Apple remote buttons (this includes both press and press-and-hold). You can also define your own custom actions if the built-in ones don't suit. Nothing came close for me in terms of flexibility and ease of use - I tried both Mira and Sofa Control before settling on RB.\n\nPersonally, I use this to control my XBMC media centre with a range of custom button-presses and use the launch menu to start it up.

I have seen some expensive converter boxes, that come with proprietary software, that you can buy that will auto-encode and create a DVD for you, but I'd rather be able to import the video directly to iMovie or Final Cut Pro so I can work with it how I want. Quality isn't critical, so I'm looking for an inexpensive, \"do-it-yourself\" solution, that would ideally allow me to import the video into my software of choice, rather than paying a company to do it for me.\nWhat is the best way to connect a VCR to my Mac, so that I can import these videos into iMovie or Final Cut Pro?\n\nA: If you have an older DV video camera such as a Sony DCR-HC96, you can plug the VCR directly into the camera, which will convert the analog signal to a digital signal. The camera will output the video via Firewire, which will be recognizable by iMovie or FCE. This is my preferred option, because I have this camera and it works great. \nAnother option is something like what Chris Breen has talked about on his Macworld video. He recommends Roxio's Easy VHS to DVD\n\nand Elgato's Video Capture (some similar products)\n\nI don't know how well it works, since I haven't tried it myself.  \nYet another option would be to use a DVD recorder with RCA inputs to play the VHS to a DVD.\n\nOnce you've burned a DVD of the VHS tape, then you can use conversion software, such as Handbrake to convert the DVD to a usable format. I would also recommend this, since I've done this before, although I prefer the first method, since it is faster.\n\nA: Thanks to Jason Shipps I decided to try going with a cheap analog to digital converter cable called the EasyCap DC60. For less than $10 it was worth a try and has worked pretty well so far. \n\nThe reviews are mixed since a lot of people have had a hard time getting it configured correctly. You will need the right software to record the video. You will need the EasyCapViewer app installed in order to record the video. Make sure you get a genuine DC60 and not a DC60+ since it will determine your software support. There's a list of supported devices on the EasyCapViewer website.\nObviously, you get what you pay for, but if you want a cheap way to convert analog video, then this is worth a try.\n\nA: No, \"cheap cables\" will do you no good, because you require a computer peripheral to accept the analog video signal and convert it into a digital format. There is nothing inside your Mac that can accept analog video and convert it to digital.\nDepending on the number of hours of video you need to convert, you may be better served by finding a company that will perform this service for you for a fee, rather that purchasing the equipment and learning to use it yourself.\nI'm not up-to-speed on the latest technology, but working from VHS tapes, you would be looking for a conversion device that accepts Composite video or S-Video, along with unbalanced RCA stereo audio, and which performs the analog-to-digital conversion and outputs a digital signal, over FireWire or USB, that Apple iMovie can record.\nHere is one such example, the Grass Valley ADVC55, which costs US $180.\n\nA: Another cheap way to convert VHS to digital is to plug the VHS player into the TV and the audio into your DSLR mic input and record the TV in a dark room with the audio in sync as it plays. This is similar to old \"telecine\" methods of transferring film to video and it is very low tech provided you have a DSLR that can record video, preferably with a microphone input.\n", "Q: How do I play FLV and MP4 files on my jailbroken iPhone 4, without converting the files? I have a jailbroken iphone 4. Is there  way to play MP4 and FLV files without converting them? I'd like to play them straight on my iPhone,since it takes too spend time to use iTunes to convert the files.\n\nA: VLC (google it) plays just about everything. Unfortunately, due to a strict interpretation of some open source licenses (that is, not Apple's fault), the iOS version was pulled from the App Store. \nFortunately, though, you can still install it by using Cydia. Or at least that's what I've read (I haven't done it myself), see the instructions for details.\nGetting the video files onto your phone will be more of a hassle, but I think this might be your best bet. Can't hurt to try.\n\nA: You might want to check out the app GPlayer in the app store and see if it does what you need in regards to playing video. There's a free, ad-supported version and an ad-free version available.  No need to jailbreak. \n\nA: iPhone 4 supports MP4 files. Sometimes it is quite common that iPhone 4 cannot play MP4 files due to the codec issues. FLV is not a file format supported by iPhone 4. I am not sure if there is a quite nice solution to play MP4 and FLV files on iPhone 4 without converting them. I often convert the files to iPhone 4 supported formats.

Someone called me last month. I know date and approximate time, but I'm unable to see that call in my iPhone. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: There's no way to see the true call history as a proper timeline through the iPhone, although with a bit of work it can be achieved however apps like PhoneView allow you to see your call history as individual, historical calls.\nWhen you connect to the app, it downloads your call history for you, and you can then clear it on the iPhone without losing the history in the app.\nNow, one of the things that the iPhone history does is try to group conversations into one event.  If you compare my call log from my iPhone and from PhoneView below.\nThis first image is the output from PhoneView, showing a list of all my calls for most of a week in February, date ascending.\n\nThe second image is a screen cap of my iPhone call history for the same time frame, dates descending just to confuse you.\n\nAs you can see, the iPhone does some grouping on calls, both incoming and outgoing, to the same number.  Note that 11 calls on the 10th, plus 2 each from the 12th and 13th, and finally one on the 14th appear against the call log for the 14th making a total of 16 calls.\nHere's what the iPhone tells us about that grouping (thats by pressing the blue arrow next to the item)\n\nSo what does this tell us:\n\n\n*\n\n*either you deleted the call log for that call (swipe to delete)\n\n*they called again, or you called them on a different date and the\ncall log is now on that date and you are looking in the wrong place\n\n*you accidentally assigned the number to an existing contact and\n    you are looking in the wrong place\n", "Q: Can't get Safenote to open; freezes on loading screen I've had the Safenote app for quite a while now and have a lot of useful notes in there.

(Say I wanted to buy an iPad SIM card later from AT&T, would I have that option?)\n\nA: Yes.\n(It's a \"world iPad\" for both the AT&T and Verizon model.)\nWhether a device functions worldwide for a specific wireless standard depends on the frequency bands that it supports.\nE.g. The new iPad supports LTE, but only the frequency bands 700 MHz and 2100 MHz which are not used outside the US.\nThe iPhone 4S has been called a world phone, because it supports all the frequency band used for GSM worldwide:\n\n*\n\n*850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz\n\nThe new iPad supports the same GSM frequency bands for both the AT&T and Verizon model.

Which essentially reformats the drive.\n", "Q: Shutdown MacMini with hardware button I have a MacMini (Intel Core Solo with OSX 10.6.8) running as an iTunes Server with an external USB Storage without Keybord/Mouse/Monitor. Starting the MacMini is fairly easy, power on the USB storage, then push the power button on the MacMini.\nBut how can I shutdown the MacMini with this button? Activating sleep is possible, but I want a clean shutdown if I push the hardware button.\n\nA: For a clean shutdown (the button solution is not clean and there is no way around it, i am afraid) i suggest you to connect to your iTunes Server via ssh from a second machine and shut it down this way.\nAnother option would be through Apple Script. If you have a specific time that you want to shutdown your iTunes Server, or if there is no request inbound to this server for a specific time a script could be auto-activated to archive this.\nThough the first option is much easier to accomplish!\n\nA: I have come up with a solution to this problem.  I run a headless Mac Mini and I always just held down the power button to turn it off until I found out this was a good way to screw up the drive...  What I do now is I bought a Cyberpower UPS battery buck up, and I configured it to shut the mac mini don when it detects there is no power.  I also configured the UPS to then shut it's self down after 1 minute.  Then also configured it to tell the mac mini to restart when the power returns to the UPS.  I have a switch on my wall that shuts down the power to my socket which the UPS is plugged into.  So when I want the mac Mini to shut down I just hit the switch on my wall and presto the mac mini shut down and when I want it to restart i hit the switch again.\n\nA: I think what you're asking is how can you do a shut down using the power button. You could use the methods mentioned by @v2r, but if you just want to use the power button, you have to hold it down for a few seconds for the Mac Mini to power off. I don't recommend doing this frequently, as it does not allow the OS to shut down properly.\n", "Q: VGA vs Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter I'm about to buy an external monitor to use with my MacBook Pro late 2008. I do understand HDMI (digital) looks much better on screen (better quality?) than VGA (analog), so I'm thinking about buying a Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter. My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter decrease video quality?\n\n*If so, is it noticeable and does it still have better quality than VGA?\n\n*Are there any known issues with third-party adapters?\n\n\nA: No HDMI and DVI are both digital signals there will be no degradation in quality between the two. If in fact they are compatible with each other as referenced on Wikipedia.\n\nHDMI is backward-compatible with single-link Digital Visual Interface digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A). No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric cable is used, so there is no loss of video quality.[5]\n\nBoth are much better than VGA. VGA is an analog signal. There are noticeable differences when using a VGA connection vs a pure digital one. Everything will appear to have a slight fuzziness, it's not horrible but if you have good vision you can see the difference up close. With pure digital, the text, images, etc with all be sharper. This is a side effect of the analog to digital conversion that the LCD monitor has to do. Additionally as part of that conversion process most LCDs have an auto correction button to dynamically adjust the VGA signal to fix over-scan and other minor adjustments to the VGA source. Something that you don't ever have to do with a digital source. I would avoid buying a monitor that only has VGA input, spend $20 to $50 more and get a better display that has at least one digital input source, either DVI or HDMI.\nConfirming Source for LCD Analog vs Digital inputs.\nI have had bad luck with 2 Mini-DVI to VGA adapters purchased from Monoprice.com that had Red, Green, Blue hewing due to poor wiring. For example, I had to slightly twist the cable to get the picture color just right. They replaced one and then the second one did the same thing, I am due for a third try...  However my mini-DVI to HDMI adapter from them works flawlessly and has since day one.\n", "Q: Quicktime: Grey background upon resume in fullscreen mode A clip that was played in fullscreen mode will not appear in fullscreen mode.\nInstead, it's slightly shifted, resized and has a grey background.\nI've removed the Quicktime plug-in Perian, but this behavior is persistent.\n\n\n*\n\n*What's causing this? How can I fix this?\n\n\n\n\nA: This is an annoying bug in QuickTime Player. There isn't much you can do about it, I'm afraid.\nClosing and then reopening the file usually fixes it, but if it doesn't you can try logging out and then back in.\nIf QuickTime gets so 'confused' that it can't open properly, quit using cmd-opt-q to prevent it from saving what's open. That should allow you to open it up and try again.\nAs always, file a bug report on the Apple website.\n", "Q: How does MobiForms bypass the app store? There's a neat iOS app called MobiForms (www.mobiforms.com). It's available for the iPod/iPhone yet somehow they are bypassing the Apple app store and selling it to you directly. How are they doing that? This is a unique trick I have not encountered yet.\n\nA: there is no MobiForms App in the iOS App store.\n\nThe latest version of MobiForms now supports Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. MobiForms supports many Apple iOS specific features including the built-in camera and GPS. The major advantage of MobiForms is that unlike the Apple iOS/iPhone SDK you do not need to own an Apple Mac or pay for the expensive yearly membership of the iPhone Developer Program. The MobiForms Developer will run on a Windows PC or an Apple Mac. Deployment of the MobiForms app is done via the USB cable and the Apple iTunes client on Windows PC or Apple Mac.\n\nBasically what you are buying from them is a cross platform development tool.\n\nThe MobiForms adhoc deployment approach totally avoids the Apple App Store and app approval process. The app approval process alone can take weeks. Note that for each Apple iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch the MobiForms support team have to register its UUID with Apple to receive a runtime certificate for the MobiForms runtime client to run. The MobiForms licence includes free registration for one iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. There is a small fee (£10 approx $15) for each additional iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Additional MobiForms iPhone certificates can be purchased from the MobiForms iPhone Certificate Buy Now button. \n\nThe development tool outputs an app, and you then pay them to make your iDevice a registered development device, and you can then install the app on your phone as if you were a real iOS developer.\n", "Q: Are the Apple text-to-speech voices copyrighted? I want to use an excerpt of an OS X text-to-speech voice in a song that I am recording. Is there any kind of copyright restriction for recordings of the computer voice I should know about, or are they totally free for anyone to use for any purpose?\n\nA: You are not free to use them for any purpose, only for personal, non-commercial use while running Apple software. Read Mac OS X Lion Software License Agreement for full details (section G, it is rather short and clear):\n\nVoices Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may use the system voices included in the Apple Software (“System Voices”) (i) while running the Apple Software and (ii) to create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use.

It seems that by default there is no way to enter a whole path in the Finder, so instead one should traverse through all the tree to get somewhere deep in the filesystem. Is there anyway to overcome this problem? If there is no GUI for it in the Finder maybe launching it from the command line with the path? Something like:\nfinder /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/\n\n\nA: Use Spotlight Search (which can be opened quickly with Command + Space or sometimes a dedicated key like ).  It has been around since Mac OSX 10.4 Tiger.\nJust type or paste the full path into the Spotlight Search box.  Even a partial folder and/or file name can also reveal the destination, albeit there might be a long list of matches to weed through.\n\nA: The command line version would be:\nopen -R /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/\n\nor just:\nopen /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/\n\ndepending on you want to go inside the folder or reveal the folder in finder.\n\nA: Finder has a menu item found under Go (\"Go to Folder…\") where you can type a full path.\nThe command+shift+G keyboard shortcut makes it handy to summon. This short cut works in the file open and save dialog as well.\n\nTab file path completion works in this window as does pasting words or a path for a file or network share.\nThe open command works to do this from the command line.\nopen /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/\n\n", "Q: Freeware for tiling windows \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat Window Management Options exist for OS X? \n\nI've seen many, many utilities for resizing windows (BST, Moom, Divvy, SizeUp...) but I wanted to know if there were any available for free. Most of these utilities have a free trial, but I'd expect there's at least one available completely free.\nSo, is there one?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool is a freeware application mainly for defining custom gestures of trackpads and Magic Mice, but it also has the ability to tile windows.\n\n", "Q: Setting up TimeCapsule with existing Router(with DHCP disabled) I have an existing Belkin modem-router, and a new Time Capsule. I would like the Time Capsule to act as the router and DHCP server, and the belkin modem-router to just be a modem.\nI connected one of the LAN ports on my Belkin Router to the WAN port on the Time Capsule and then disabled the DHCP server on the Belkin Router.\nNow when I set up the Time Capsule I'm not sure what settings to choose?\nOn Manual Setup on the Internet tab, should I choose share a public IP address or Distribute a range of IP addresses or bridge Mode? It is also asking for settings like DNS server? Surely the WAN IP and DNS Servers should be handled by the modem?\nAnd In the internet tab, under TCP/IP should I choose Manually or DHCP.\nBasically I want my Belkin router to be only a modem, and the Time Capsule to do the DHCP, NAT, Wireless, etc.\n\nA: Disable NAT and DHCP on the router.  Plug the Time Capsule's WAN port into the router's LAN port.  Better yet, see if the router has a \"bridge\" mode.  The Time Capsule usually would run in 'distribute a range' mode, which IIRC means DHCP and NAT.  'Share a public' would be DHCP only.  And bridge is a simple pass-through mode (much like we've just tried to put your Belkin into).\n", "Q: What's a free or cheap text-to-speech program that is available for commercial use? As I said in my previous question, I want to use an excerpt of a text-to-speech voice in a song. Where can I find a free or cheap service that'll let me do this without breaking their terms of use?\n\nA: eSpeak is a brilliant opensource text to speech project. It's the default TTS software on many Linux distributations, but there's a Mac version available and it works great. There is also a project based on eSpeak called Mbrola which adds \"singing\" functionality.\nFwiw, I really don't see Apple suing you if you use the built-in TTS they provide.\n\nA: Dunno if this is exactly what you want, but GarageBand has options for vocal tracks (Mouse Voice, Deeper Voice, Helium Breath, etc.) so you could speak the text yourself and then alter it. It is then usable commercially, as the GarageBand software license agreement says:\n\nGarageBand Software. You may use the Apple and third party audio loop content (Audio Content), contained in or otherwise included with the Apple Software, on a royalty-free basis, to create your own original music compositions or audio projects. You may broadcast and/or distribute your own music compositions or audio projects that were created using the Audio Content, however, individual audio loops may not be commercially or otherwise distributed on a standalone basis, nor may they be repackaged in whole or in part as audio samples, sound effects or music beds.\n\n", "Q: iOS Simulator Hidden in Xcode 4.3.1? This is more of an \"am I doing this right?\" type of question...\nI recently performed a clean install of Lion and installed Xcode 4.3.1 from the App Store.  I noticed that the /Developer folder was missing so in my search I found in the release notes they talked about how the tools are consolidated into Xcode now.  Okay, fair enough.  I followed the instructions and downloaded the iOS simulator from Preferences > Downloads:\n\nThe iOS simulator is nowhere to be found anywhere in Xcode or in the Open Developer Tool menu with the rest of the tools either:\n\nTurns out I have to drill down through this path to find it!?\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone Simulator.app\nReally Apple?  So... Is it okay to just drag this out and into my Applications folder?  Are there dependencies?  Will it break?  How are you launching this app without having to drill down into that folder every time?  (Spotlight can't find it).\ntl;dr: Apple hides iOS Simulator deep in the Xcode package contents.  What's the best practice to launch the app in a convenient way and why can't I find it in the Xcode GUI?\n\nA: I would leave the simulator in the Xcode package, but drag it to your dock to easily launch it. Or make an alias to it and place that alias in what ever spot you want to launch simulator from.\n", "Q: An undefined volume appears out of nowhere?

Unlike face detection in, say, iPhoto, this isn't about actually associating a face with a contact you already have (through similar photos), but rather about helping the camera focus on what you'll likely want to have in focus (namely, faces). Here's Apple's marketing text on it:\n\nThis camera loves a face.\nWith new face detection, the iSight camera is smart enough to know whether you’re taking a portrait or a group shot. It focuses on the most prominent face in the frame and balances exposure across up to 10 faces. So you’ll definitely catch smiles. And maybe even a smirk or two.\n\nYou'll know face detection is working from the green rectangle that appears.\nNew to 5.1 is that more than one such green \"detected face rectangle\" may show up:\n\nCamera face detection now highlights all detected faces\n\n", "Q: How can I change the resolution on my Mac to 720p (1280x720)? I'm looking to record some screencasts, and 720p (1280x720) seems to be the best choice for the resolution. It's supported by video sites like YouTube and Vimeo as one of the standard \"HD\" resolutions, but it's small enough that it can be comfortably viewed on smaller screens without needing to play the video back full screen.\nHowever, there is no option for 1280x720 in my System Preferences. How can I get my Mac to use this resolution? I've seen SwitchResX and I've tried to make it work, but it's very complicated and I haven't had much luck with it. Are there any other utilities that do the same thing? Would buying a Mini DisplayPort -> HDMI adapter and hooking it up to a 720p TV work?\n\nA: One quick tip for finding more resolutions is to hold the Option key while clicking Scaled in System Preferences > Displays. This definitely works in OS X El Capitan and I think it worked in Yosemite at least.\nFor example, without Option, my 1440x900 macbook air screen gives me 1440 x 900, 1280 x 800, 1152 x 720, and 1024 x 640. But when I add Option, it adds 1140 x 810, 1280 x 720 (the one you want), and 800 x 600.\n\nA: Buying a MiniDisplay port to HDMI adapter and then attaching a 720P display in Mirroring   mode works at setting an effective 720P resolution. As indicated by the screen capture below. The screen shot shown in preview was taken when the setup was in Mirroring Mode with a 720P TV. The picture below containing that screen shot is when the MacBook is running in normal 1280 x 800 mode.\n\nStuff involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 13\"\n\n*Vizio 720P TV\n\n*Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter\n\nA: Try recording a smaller area, or shrinking the footage after recording. 720P is a 16:9 aspect ratio, whereas macs use 16:10 screens, so 1280 x 800 is the closest match\n\nA: I was able to do this with SwitchResX on my 13\" MacBook Air running Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite. The little utility lets you select from a very long list of common and not-so-common resolution sizes. 720P is among them.\nInterestingly, I was able to use 1080P as well even though my display does not support a resolution that high. The quality seemed almost native to me (granted, I'm not a display junkie or a gamer), but everything was a bit too small for my liking.\nI recorded a few screen-casts with ScreenFlow already and they come out a perfect 1280 x 720 pixels.\n\nA: No external software is required to change the resolutions. Just click on the scaled option under display tab by holding the option key on the keyboard which shows all available 16:9(1280x720, 2560x1080, 1024x768) resolutions. \nhttps://youtu.be/U63_twpDCEo\n\n\nA: Switchres allows you to change to lots more screen resolution than system preferences allows: http://www.madrau.com/\n\nA: it could depend on what you are recording. if it is minecraft you can add a setting that it is 1280x720 pixels. you then record that using obs or crop it a bit using quicktime.\n\nA: Try out QuickRes.\nThat seems to work.\n", "Q: Cloud Backup Options for HD Attached to Time Capsule I connected an external HD to my Time Capsule and I've relocated my iPhoto and iTunes libraries to this HD.  Time Machine is only backing up my computer's HD and I'd like an offsite backup of the external HD.  I'm looking for recommendations on software services that would work for me.\n\nA: For cloud/online based backups here are a few to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backblaze \n\n*Mozy \n\n*Carbonite\n\n*Crashplan\nThey are all mostly the same - you install their software, pay an annual or monthly fee and your data is constantly backed up to their servers. A few offer more advanced features like mirroring to their servers and another machine.\nI've put Backblaze at the top because thats what I use at home to backup my photos and music. Its cheap @ $50 per year for unlimited storage. I set it up once and never had to look at it again. Last week I recovered a folder of files through their web-interface, though you can (like most cloud backup companies) order a hard-drive with the contents. \n\nAnother more DIY solution is using AmazonS3 combined with a backup program like GoodSync. You use S3 for the storage and then setup your backup/sync options in Goodsync. We use this at work to backup important project files. The advantage of this method is you have the same level of control you get when using backup software (timed backups/backups when files are changed/email notifications/advanced file comarison etc)\nHere is a good starter article for AmazonS3 backups. Its also worth noting that AmazonS3 might end up being more expansive than a regular cloud backup service. You can calculate how much S3 would cost using their Simple Monthly Calculator\n", "Q: How can I set the double-click speed in Lion with a multi-touch trackpad? In Snow Leopard and earlier (or perhaps the difference was with the hardware; I don't know which as I updated my computer and OS simultaneously), there was a preference under Trackpad to change the speed needed to perform a double-click. How can I speed it up now that it isn't there?\n\nA: In Lion, the trackpad double-click speed slider and a few other trackpad options have been moved to: System Preferences > Universal Access > Mouse & Trackpad > Trackpad Options. \n\n", "Q: A file exists in guest Windows XP (under Fusion), can I open the file in an OSX program? So the text editor on Windows is crap.  I realize I could find a fancier text editor that works within Windows but I'm happy with TextMate on my Mac and I'd rather not have two \"fancy\" text editors (one for the windows guest and one for the mach host).\nIs there a way I can right-click a windows (again, I'm running Windows XP as a guest operation system under Fusion) txt file and have it open in TextMate on my Mac?\nI woudn't mind if I had to do this manually each time but a permanent association would be even cooler...\nIn case it helps the guest is Windows XP (latest SP) and the host is OSX 10.7.3 with the latest Fusion.  Also, I've got several directories mapped from the Mac to the Windows installation (as Z: drive or something) in case this helps and can add more shares.\nPS - I don't expect anything crazy like that TextMate would show up \"within\" Windows XP.  I'm happy have TextMate launch outside of the guest OS window with the file in question.  More bonus would be if I could edit the file and save it (the save going to the Windows guest).\n\nA: If you keep your files in the OS-X file system and share those folders with your guest - as in your Z: drive example - you can access them from either OS (or both, if you're careful), plus however you backup OS-X will also back up your changed XP files without its having to backup your entire guest VDD for a (e.g.) one-line edit.  \nThe save would not go to your guest file system though, so if that's a hard requirement, this suggestion won't help.  If you just need the guest to have access to it, this would be the way to go.\n", "Q: How does the new iPad's A5X graphics processor affect PDF rendering speed? How much, if any, has the new iPad has gained in PDF rendering speed with the A5X processor (quad-core graphics)?\n\nA: I care a lot about PDFs because as a lawyer I have to review a lot of scanned documents. The performance of PDF rendering on the new iPad depends on the techniques used. For full-resolution rendering, it's a little slower, but software goes a long way. The overall experience depends on four factors:\n1) Single-page rendering method\n2) Zoom method\n3) Caching\n4) Pre-rendering \nExplanation:\n1) Single page rendering: some apps don't display anything until the whole page is rendered. Others render in a tiled fashion: some top to bottom, some in a spiral inside out. Some apps first render a low-res version of the page, then render the full-res version--again, by either of the two methods. \n2) Zoom: Again, some apps render on the fly, while others zoom in on the pre-rendered image and pop in the re-rendered tiles or the whole view. The iPad handles vector rescaling (including text) superbly, but rasterized PDFs can't be scaled in real-time if they're in iPad-resolution territory. \n3) Caching: some apps don't cache at all, so re-render each time you change the view (even if you're on the same page). Others only cache one page at a time. Still others cache three pages or more, so you can flip pages and zoom in smoothly without re-rendering.\n4) Pre-rendering: a few apps will pre-render the next page. One app, described below, pre-renders the whole document. \niBooks and the Amazon Kindle app render large PDFs pretty efficiently. iBooks caches three pages, while Kindle's cache seems to depend on page size. Kindle pre-renders the next page while you're on the preceding page. However, neither support PDF markup. (Kindle also doesn't support rotation \nOne app, just called \"PDF\" (by Smalltalk Consulting) pre-renders the entire PDF so that most of the subsequent work is done by the GPU. You set the rendering resolution. The default \"2x\" gives you around 150dpi, \"4x\" around 300 dpi, etc. It slows down once you get past 4.5x, but that resolution is sufficient for most applications. This is the best app I've found to scroll quickly through large PDFs. However, it doesn't render markup and doesn't support any markup tools of its own. \nIn short, the new iPad cannot speed through a 600dpi PDF the way a quad-core i7 with 12GB of RAM can. But it can display and handle large PDF files the way they were meant to be--with the right software.\nGoodreader has the best performance of any PDF viewer I've tried, followed by PDF Expert. Certain techniques that worked on the old iPad just don't fly on the new one, so some apps perform very poorly. (Adobe's own Reader is one of these.) Other apps, like iPDF, are promising, but still don't have full Retina support. (Several apps only take advantage of the Retina display when zoomed in, but double the pixels when viewing the whole page.)\nTo answer the original question and the follow-up: rendering is done by the CPU, display and manipulation (scrolling, zooming) is done by the GPU. The CPU converts the text portions using the text rendering engine and the graphical portions using a bitmap engine. (It's possible that the iPad's text rendering engine is handled by the GPU.) \nThe CPU on the new iPad is not significantly faster. PDF rendering methods that are CPU-heavy are even slower on the new iPad because the CPU has to do significantly more work to render at the higher resolution. But rendering methods that get data to the GPU quickly perform great. The more rendering work done in the background, the better. A well-designed PDF rendering engine will use idle time to generate image data that's ready for the GPU. An engine that renders \"on the fly\" (what I called \"in real time\") will choke.\n\"Pre-rendering the entire PDF\" means that instead of each page being converted to an image as you scroll through, the whole PDF is rendered and loaded into memory as an image. This takes more RAM but results in faster performance when scrolling and zooming. It takes 5-30 seconds (or more) to pre-render the whole file. Also, when zooming in, the image does not re-scale. (Text portions of the PDF won't be crisp if you zoom in.) Google Docs basically does this with PDFs if you want to see what I'm talking about.\n\nA: Probably little to none - PDFs are rendered in 2D, and most of the benefit of the A5X's graphic processing will be with 3D performance. The A5X is rumored to have twice the RAM of the A5 chip, so that could help with PDF performance if properly utilized. The thing that would help PDF performance the most is a faster CPU or more CPU cores...the A5X CPU is still only dual-core and Apple hasn't announced any improvements in CPU speed. We'll know more about business app performance once the new iPad ships, but for now I wouldn't get your hopes up. \n\nA: Apparently the new iPad (3rd gen.) can be even slower than the iPad 2 when rendering e.g. PDFs.\nThe German magazine c't (or rather the new \"Mac & i\") tested the new iPad (3rd gen.):\n\nGrundsätzlich haben Apps, die auf dem höheren Display mehr Informationen zur Darstellung laden und berechnen müssen, performance-mäßig zu kämpfen: Die Mac & i-App beispielsweise stellt Artikel-PDFs langsamer dar als auf dem iPad 2, auch Webseiten in Safari werden bisweilen zäher gerendert. Das fällt wiederum nur beim direkten Vergleich auf.\n\nTranslation:\nBasically apps that need to load and draw more information for the higher resolution may be struggling: The Mac & i app, for example, displays PDFs slower than on the iPad 2, and web pages in Safari sometimes take longer to get rendered. However, this is only apparent in a direct comparison.\n", "Q: How to make USB optical mouse work with MacBook Air? I just bought a MacBook Air and a cheap Leadership USB optical mouse, which I can't get to work with the MacBook. It works fine with Windows and Linux, and the Macbook Air USB ports are fine. I checked it with USB drive and a Microsoft mouse without encountering any problems.\nWhat can I do to solve the problem?\n\nA: If it supports the standard USB mouse functionality (HID), it should work.  Otherwise, you can use SteerMouse or USB Overdrive.  If you have the Developer Tools installed, you might also see what USB Prober says about the device.\n", "Q: Why doesn't tap-clicking work often in Flash? In a few situations in Flash, tapping to click doesn't work, while mechanically clicking does. (Tap-clicking is of course turned on.) It's in some cases a Flash game, and in some cases Hulu or another video site. Why doesn't tapping work, and why does clicking work?\nMy guess is that it has something to do with whatever the Flash equivalent is of \"mouse down\" versus \"mouse clicked.\"\n\nA: It's probably about that Flash object's design/development.\nI haven't used Flash for development in a long time, but it must have attributes for allowing/disallowing such things. And since every developer behaves differently you are experiencing different things like that.\n", "Q: Speaker on iPhone not working with Skype or Viber I have an iPhone 4, a couple of days ago the speaker when using Skype and Viber stopped working, I tried removing the apps and reinstalling them and have updated to 5.0.1 and it is still not working.

I was thinking of shutdown -h now, but that way seems kind of \"dirty.\" What are some ways to do it?\n\nA: If you don't care about saving the session, you can simply hit Ctrl + Option + ⌘ + ⏏ for Shutdown or Ctrl + ⌘ + ⏏ for Restart\nYou can also check out this post (Disable \"Reopen Windows\") on disabling resume if you don't want that. There is another solution posted here on Apple's forums for disabling the feature by William Donelson (second post by him on the page).\n\nA: Typing Ctrl + ⏏ brings up the shutdown dialog window, which is a bit faster than clicking the Apple menu.\n\nA: This can all be controlled by a Preference. Below is for Mountain Lion, which was changed slightly from Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Menu - System Preferences\n\n*General (under Personal section)\n\n*Select \"Close Windows when quitting an Application\" - this makes it so windows don't open when you reopen an app.\n\n*Now when you shut down (and tell it not to reopen windows on restart) they will not open then - or later.\n\n\nA: Functional is a collection of utilities bringing the basic Mac OS X functions from the Apple menu to your Dock.

I own a Mac mini 2011 server which I use as workstation. Currently Mac OS X Lion and Windows 7 Professional are installed in parallel (via Boot Camp). Both are 64-bit operating systems.\nI'd like to install a Linux system on the machine. Which distro would you recommend the most? I thought of Ubuntu but I'm not sure about the 64-bit support in it (which I believe is needed to make use of the full 8 gb RAM).\nBy \"best\" I mean \"best hardware support\". Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*drivers for 64-bit operation\n\n*support two displays \n\n*support Bluetooth in general\n\n*Bluetooth support for Magic Trackpad, specifically\n\n*good WiFi support\n\n\nOf the above, most important would be full support for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two displays are connected, one via HDMI, one via Thunderbolt\n\n*A Magic Trackpad via Bluetooth\n\n\nA: From a few minutes of searching, it looks like Ubuntu 11.04 would be a good fit and match most of your requests, and what you were looking to use as well.\n64bit would be needed to reach more than 4GB of RAM. And there is a 64 bit version, although (to me) confusingly named AMD64. This would be the version you need. \nThere are also Magic Trackpad drivers available, and a good writeup available on the Ubuntu Wiki.\nI also found a good site documenting installing 11.04 on a MacBook Pro. This should be rather similar to your instal. \nFinally, in most cases, choosing the right Linux distro is also a feel and how you like the install. But in accordance with your list of support, it looks like Ubuntu will cover this.\n\nA: linux mint, whatever the current edition is. It's configured to detect the apple magic trackpad (if you have paired it with the mac mini using os10.x before booting from linux. This is crucial. Booted into Ubuntu using refit and could not type or mouse. I no longer have any wired pointing devices or keyboards at my design studio. Plenty of them at the lab, but no help miles away. Linux Mint worked magically right from the usb stick I made with the unetbootin app. Without Bluetooth pairing. \nStep 1: Instead of patching Refit for lion use the refined \"rEFInd\" at http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/?source=directory. After installing, your mac will look for other operating systems at boot and provide you with a list of bootable volumes attached to the mac. \nBefore you restart, you'll need something to boot from. Pull Linux Mint right from the web to a bootable usb key with http://sourceforge.net/projects/unetbootin/ \nonce it has finished downloading and configuring the live disk, restart and when refind comes up, select the usb drive. \nViola! \nI realize the original question may have been posed by someone with more than enough skill to do this all manually, I just wanted to make sure I left my answer with enough info to be helpful to people who haven't done anything like this before.\nHope it helps\n", "Q: What does preparing to copy mean? I'm trying to copy a large amount of files from a hard drive to a time capsule. Around 200 GB.\nNormally copying files in OSX is quite fast and simple, but I found this unmanageable, as before it starts copying it prepares to copy the files, And the number of files to copy slowly increases.\nNormally this stage is over in the blink of an eye, but because of the large volume it took more than 20 minutes, I gave up after that.\nWhat exactly is it doing in this time? Why does it need to do that, when I'm simply copying one folder (there is just one folder in the root level of the hard drive) so it knows that all the files are in there.\nIs there anyway to skip this process, as it is actually faster, although more time consuming for me, to copy smaller chunks of it, one after the other?\nWhy can't it just copy all the 1s and 0s across without any of this preparing?\n\nA: Not sure what the 'preparing' stage actually does.  I suspect it could have something to do with verifying that the destination doesn't have files/folders that are present in the source (leading to it having to ask you what to do about the conflict).\nIn either case, if you are comfortable with Terminal, you can use rsync which begins copying immediately and gives you feedback right away.\nI would use something like:\nrsync --partial --progress -av ~/Desktop/MyFolder /Volumes/MyTimeCapsule/\n\n\nA: As @Harv suggests you can use rsync to copy files instead of the Finder, but if you use the rsync version (2.6.x) that Apple includes with Mavericks, it will want to build a file list before copying anything, which is what you're trying to avoid in the first place.\nVersion 3 or newer of rsync can apparently build the file list on the fly, according to an answer here: https://serverfault.com/questions/208494/rsync-is-just-hanging-building-file-list\nTo use rsync 3 you'll have to get a newer version from somewhere; here's a blog post that talks about some options: http://blog.brettalton.com/2013/08/05/how-to-speed-up-rsync-on-your-mac-and-stop-the-dreaded-building-file-list/\n", "Q: iPad 1 stuck in DFU mode after 5.0.1 -> 5.1 OTA-update I have tried restoring through iTunes, but I only get \"Error 37\" at the end of the \"Restoring iPad firmware\" step.\nSnippets from the restore log:\n2012-03-11 18:00:05.684 [3132:e4]: <Restore Device 069D6950>: operation 18 progress 53\n2012-03-11 18:00:05.884 [3132:e4]: <Restore Device 069D6950>: operation 18 progress 61\n2012-03-11 18:00:06.169 [3132:e4]: <Restore Device 069D6950>: operation 18 progress 69\n2012-03-11 18:00:06.535 [3132:e4]: <Restore Device 069D6950>: operation 18 progress 76\n2012-03-11 18:00:06.821 [3132:e4]: <Restore Device 069D6950>: operation 18 progress 84\n2012-03-11 18:00:09.037 [3132:e4]: device returned AMR error 37\n\n(It fails at 84% \"restoring firmware\" each time)\nand:\nentering update_device_firmware\nentering update_iBoot\nwrite_image3_data: flashing LLB data (length = 0x14a19)\nAppleImage3NORAccess::_getSuperBlock imageVersion: 3\nAppleImage3NORAccess::_getSuperBlock imageVersion: 3\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0xb10)\nticket updated\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x2ea19)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0xf859)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x1d59)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0xb999)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x4519)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x1819)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x13d9)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x3e59)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x13d9)\nwrite_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x3cf19)\n0: RamrodErrorDomain/3e9: update_iBoot: error writing image\n1: NSMachErrorDomain/e00002bc: write_image3_data: AppleImage3NORAccess returned an error when writing image3 object\nattempting to dump restore log\nwriting log file: /mnt1/restore.log\n\nI have tried pretty much everything:\n\n\n*\n\n*Different computers (both mac and win7)\n\n*Different usb-cables\n\n*Re-downloading the ipsw\n\n*Re-installing iTunes\n\n*Removing every playlist/book/movie from my iTunes library\n\n*Disabling auto-sync of devices in iTunes\n\n\nThe documentation for \"error 37\" indicates problems with security software (which I'm not running), and judging by the restore log this looks like more a bug in the updater/firmware itself.\nThe iPad was running fine with iOS 5.0.1 and has never been jailbroken.\n\nA: This suggests that your NOR is failing/has failed.

I am in my iTunes library (not a playlist) and have \"shuffle\" turned on (songs, not albums). If I click on \"play\", it plays the song currently highlighted, then stops (it does not play another song afterwards).\nThe only way I get it to play several songs is by manually checking the songs I want to be played. Which obviously is the opposite of random shuffling.\nAlso, when I turn off shuffle, then turn it on again, I don't see any change in the order of songs in the library (whereas when I'm in a playlist, I do see a change in the order).\nIn all the help forums, I've only found answers to the question of how to turn \"shuffle\" on. I know that. But how do I get iTunes to play songs randomly once shuffle is turned on?\n\nA: When iTunes shuffles through a playlist, library, or other list, it only will shuffle among items for which the \"checkbox\" column is checked. By default, this would include all the items in your library; only if you uncheck the box for a song would that remove it from the list of songs to shuffle.\nIt sounds as though your library is set up with all the songs unchecked. If no songs are checked to be included in shuffle, one gets the behavior you describe. The solution is to go to your library and make sure all your items are checked, not unchecked.\n\nA: My version of iTunes did the same and I was finding it very tricky to get it to randomly shuffle through all my tracks, even though they were all checked.\nStrangely, it's now working fine again. All I had to do was switch to the \"songs\" view of my library, hit CTRL+A (to highlight all songs) & press play.  That seems to have kicked things back off.  Now even if I clear the \"Up Next\" playlist and close iTunes, next time I open it up I just have to press \"Play\" and it will randomly shuffle over all my checked songs.\n", "Q: Removing uninstall icons OS X newbie here.\nMany applications come with their own uninstall icons - like CS5.5, which adds three of them. Those are installed side-by-side with the application icons themselves.\nTo me, they clutter my Launchpad and program folders unnecessarily, but I can't seem to be able to remove them: dragging and dropping them to the recycle bin does nothing.\nIs there a more elegant way of getting rid of these uninstall icons than placing them in a separate folder? I'm a bit anal about my launch bars and would like to avoid even that.\nCan (and should) I get rid of them permanently somehow, or do they fulfill some special function that just dragging and dropping the application to the recycle bin doesn't do?\n\nA: For Adobe products, you definitely want to use the uninstaller because they place files in locations other than just the App itself, so just dragging the application to the trash won't get rid of everything. I would suggest just making a separate folder in Launchpad for uninstallers, then you can drag all of them into that folder and it will only use up one tile.\n", "Q: Buying MacBook Pro off of craigslist - what to look for? I'm meeting someone tomorrow to purchase a MacBook Pro.  This would be my first Mac owned but I had a job a couple of years ago where I was provided with a MBP.\nI know how to inspect basics (ie, check system window and make sure the hardware matches the description), but what else should I look for?\nIt is the 2.2 i7 15 inch (assuming base model but its hard to tell from product description).\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/configure/MD318LL/A?\nAll of that being said, What should I be looking for aside from just verifying that the product matches description?  Is there any specific problems/ware to look for either specific to this model or Macbook Pros in general?  Are there any basic tests I could run to try and diagnose any of these problems?\n\nA: I wouldn't purchase this machine unless it's still covered by AppleCare.\nInspect it closely for nicks and dents, indicating a drop.  I would check the Console logs for any indication of ongoing OS level problems.\nUnfortunately testing hardware can take a while, but is worthwhile before buying.  Run AHT (see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1509?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) and do the quick test.  To do it you'll probably need the original disks that came with the machine.\nThe only other thing I can think of would be to verify that modules such as bluetooth, WiFi, Ethernet etc, are showing up properly (and information is being populated in) system profiler.  To get there, hold option while going to the apple menu - it's the first option.\nListen for loud fans, can indicate overheating or bad sensors.\nAside from that... it's always risky.  Check Apple's stock of refurb units.  They come to you refurbished by Apple, with a 1-year warranty, and often don't cost that much more than a CL unit, but with much less risk.\n\nA: Check how many loading cycles the battery has. That model's battery is officially considered \"consumed\" after 1000 cycles.\n\nA: Look for physical damage, dents scratches, cracks in the screen. Check the keyboard for spills, other than that they are pretty solid systems.\n", "Q: Buy app after downloaded with promo code I have an iOS app, and I gave all my beta testers promo codes to get free copies.

Is there any way to buy an app if a user has already downloaded it with a promo code?\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: There is no way to undo a purchase from the end user standpoint, and each user would need to contact apple for a manual adjustment to their account (which might not be something that is even done).\nThe thing you can control is for that user to set up a second Apple ID to complete a legitimate purchase that qualifies to submit a review.

Lets say we have a OS X machine running with 4 GB of RAM. Is it possible to set it up so no single process can take up more than say, 3 GB, so no matter how memory hogging a process is, there's always some memory left over to keep the system responsive?\n\nA: If you are running Lion (or newer OSX) Server on your Mac, you might be able to run OSX inside a VM (VirtualBox, Parallels, or VMWare, et.al.) on that Mac.  Limit the VM to 3GB of physical RAM, and any app or process inside the VM will also be so limited.  The system hosting the VM should stay responsive even if the OS in the VM is backing-swap-disk-limited or crashes.\nIf you are debugging a potentially runaway process, you might be able to ssh into the VM to run the debugger or a debug nub from the command line, and log stuff up until things lock up.\n\nA: A similar question to this is noted here How Can I Limit the Amount of RAM a Mac OS Application Can Use?\nThey recommend using the ulimit command, but they were unable to successfully limit the amount to what they desired. I think the problem that they ran into was the fact that the option being set -u or -v was not accounting for the memory paging system, eg you can only allocate X amount of space for you process in real RAM, but we can page you out to virtual memory all day long.  \nNote that this may be Dangerous disabling Virtual Memory, it could result in your Mac just locking up, etc when it runs of of RAM.\nTry running ulimit with arguments -l, -m, or -v however as noted in the ulimit man page it up to the OS if it will pay attention to these settings or not as noted.\n\nulimit: ulimit [-SHacdefilmnpqrstuvx] [limit]\nModify shell resource limits.\nProvides control over the resources available to the shell and processes\n      it creates, on systems that allow such control.\n\nCan't really find any definite source that confirms if OS X ignores ulimit or not, but after the referenced ulimit fail\nIf you can get ulimit to work for your needs by itself then give it a go, if not a combination of ulimit and or disabling virtual memory may be able to let you set up that 3 GB limit on select processes.

It's call Sync Services under Preferences.\nBasically, you'll use iCloud to sync your OSX Addressbook and Calendar across all three computers - that's a normal iCloud function. Then you'll use Outlooks Sync Services on each computer to sync into Outlook.\nFor calendars in iCloud you might be able to get then shared directly into Outlook, not sure.\n\nA: Yes.

There's a specific MintyBoost page detailing Apple device charging that may also yield some useful info.\n\nA: The power use is going to vary somewhat depending on external factors on the RF side. Network mode in use (GSM/3G) and the power required to establish a stable connection to the cell site in use together with any other usage on the device (speaker/bluetooth/GPS)\nBest guess is that your baseline should be the specified 1A required to charge the device and work up/down from there with a meter connected\n", "Q: How can I open a file with extension DAA on Mac?

The app page states:\n\nDAA Converter is a free utility for converting DAA & GBI disk images\n  to ISO format so they can be accessed on your Mac. \nDAA Converter is a native GUI application which wraps the command-line\n  tool, DAA2ISO/GBI2ISO, by Luigi Auriemma.  It runs on Mac OS X 10.3\n  Panther or later.\n\nI don't have any .daa files to test with, so I can't verify that this utility works. However, it's a GPL freeware app, so it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot.\n", "Q: Is loading your desktop before login safe? I came across an article explaining how to load your desktop before you login.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone know if this works in Lion?\n\n*Is there any reason I should avoid attempting it?\n\n\nLoad your desktop before login\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Users&Groups → Login Options to enable automatic login.\n\n*Then, copy and paste the following code into TextEdit.app:\n\n\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.luomat.loginhook</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n                <string>/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession</string>\n                <string>-suspend</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n3.

While it \"mostly\" worked, it created some issues over time.  Sometimes I would have to login 2 or 3 times to get back to the desktop.  I found another article that presents a perhaps cleaner method that uses the same idea (via AppleScript).  Basically, I created an App, that does the \"suspend\" via a compiled AppleScript.  I then merely added the compiled App to the end of login items (Users and Groups under System Preferences).

I recently experienced a kernel panic (\"your mac must restart...\") due to an issue with Macfusion, so after the reboot I loaded Disk Utility in an attempt to verify the disk in case something was left in a bad state. Disk Utility claims that my main partition is unmounted, though it's clearly not.\n\nIs there something amiss here or am I just suffering from post-crash paranoia? The system appears to be running properly.\nNote: I'm running OS X Lion and am using File Vault. If (because of FV) this is expected behavior, how do I run a Verify/Repair?\n\nA: The best option is to reboot with the option key held down.  Boot from your Recovery HD and first repair the volume containing the partition you indicated, then repair the partition itself.\nIt is unusual, but not unheard of for the verify function to not be available since the design is to be able to self-verify but nor self-repair the boot volume. \n", "Q: Is it possible to center align text in the Speech Bubble annotation in Preview.app? I can create Speech Bubble-style annotations in preview - and easily change the color and font styles, but the text is always left-aligned. Is is possible to center it?\n\nA: There doesn't appear to be a way to do that (other then manually centering it yourself with the space bar).\n\nA: I look at the speech (and thought) bubble feature in Preview as a nice little extra that provides basic functionality. Unfortunately, at least as of 10.7.3 Lion, text justification isn't an option. If your needs (or wants) go beyond the basics you may be interested in comic creation software like Plasq's Comic Life 2.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro doesn't stop when I close the lid It's a 13\" late 2009 model and I never had this problem up until now. Also the stop action from the  menu doesn't seem to work.\n(I have installed Caffeine but I don't think it's the problem because the macbook won't stop even if the application is closed.)\n\nA: Create a new user account.  Log out of your current user and into that new user.  Close the lid or use the apple menu.\nIf it sleeps, it's an application running in your user account that's preventing sleep from happening.\nIf it doesn't, it's system wide, maybe even a hardware problem.\nNeed more information :)\n", "Q: What integration does Apple TV offer with other Apple hardware? I just got a MacBook pro and will likely be getting an iPhone when the next generation comes out.\nThat being said - I'm debating between getting an Apple TV and a Roku box.  The Roku box seems like it has better channel offerings and also integrates with Amazon Instant Video.  It is also around $30 - $50 cheaper (not a deal breaker but worth mentioning).  \nSo the only way Apple would win out in my mind is if the integration among other Apple products was more seamless.\nThat being said - in terms of integrating with other Apple products, what does the Apple TV have to offer?\n\nA: Basically you have to decide what is most important to you. Do you want to have the widest range of content offerings(Roku), or the best compatibility between other Apple devices and software(Apple TV)?\nThe Roku box for example can play Hulu and Hulu Plus. The Hulu service is in very high demand and a very good content stream for the Roku. The Apple TV at this time will not play it out of the box, although it can be hacked to do so.\nThe biggest advantage that the Apple TV has is if you own or plan to use an iOS device in conjunction with it. For example, you can use AirPlay to stream music, photos, video, and apps to your Apple TV. This can be very handy in many situations. If you don't already have an iPhone, iPad, or the like - and don't plan on getting one anytime soon, then this shouldn't be a big draw.\nThe Apple TV also works flawlessly with iTunes. For example you can use iTunes Match then stream the audio to your Apple TV very easily. Roku can do some similar things with iTunes, but is does not have the same level of integration.\nOverall, both devices have benefits and downsides, it just depends what you think your primary use will be and what hardware ecosystem you have.  For more detailed information I would take a look at this review that compares the two.\n\nA: It's all about ecosystem.  If iTunes on your MBP and the Apple Store are going to be the center of your media universe or if Airplay is a killer app for you, you want an ATV.\n", "Q: Prevent image resizing in Pages If I paste in an image into Pages '09, it scales the image, creating something that is either too small, or too large. Trying to resize these is driving me crazy, how can I either prevent this from happening, or quickly get it back to its original size?\n\nA: In the \"Inspector\" on the \"metrics\" tab click \"Original Size\". \n\nAnd for inserting images I prefer from the menu \"Insert\" and then \"Choose...\" or ⇧+⌘+V\n\n", "Q: How can I get my iPhone to consistently apply or ignore auto-corrections based on my response? I have an iPhone 4S (Black, 32 GB, AT&T) running iOS 5.0.1, but I previously saw this issue on my jail-broken iPhone 3GS while it was running 5.0 and 4.3.3. This iPhone 4S is not jail-broken, nor has it been jail-broken in the past.\nThis occurs only sometimes. While I am typing and an auto-correction pops up, if I click on the auto-correction, it substitutes the text immediately instead of disabling that particular correction.\nIs this a bug, or is it possible that I have a setting somewhere that causes it to act in this fashion? Is there a work-around?\n\nA: Non-jailbroken iOS doesn't give much room for auto-corrections adjustment. Settings > General > Keyboard, is about all there is.\nIt is possible that it is a bug on your system, but on my 4S (5.1), I duplicated your problem only when I didn't tap the balloon itself.\n", "Q: What does the clipped corner in the color picker's sample mean? I've noticed sometimes when using Mac OS X's color picker it has a clipped corner.\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nA: I got an answer over Twitter.

Toggle the colour sliders toolbar button and click the little rainbow drop down to see the various colourspaces.\n\nIt came in two tweets, here and here.\n", "Q: Multiple Screen Standby/Resume Problems I have a large widescreen monitor plugged into my Macbook which is running Lion. Since upgrading to Lion I've noticed that I can't resume from standby if my other monitor was plugged in when I closed the lid.\nEverything works great - I close the lid and the computer enters standby like it is supposed to. Then when I open the screen the next morning, it just comes up with a lit, but dark screen. At this point, the only thing that seems to work is a hard reboot. I've tried unplugging the other monitor but that doesn't change it. \nIt is important to note that this does not happen if the monitor was not plugged in when the computer screen was closed. Also if I chose Sleep from the Apple menu, everything works great.\nAny ideas how to fix this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Long delay on this answer, but since there were no other ideas, I'll answer with what I've done.\nI simple unplug the monitor every night before putting the computer to sleep.

I would like to be able to make unread messages a different color (e.g. red)...is this possible?  I can't find a way to do it.\n\nA: I have not found an automated way to do what you are asking in Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011. \nA (very) manual way would be to create a category named Read and assign it a color that contrasts well with black. As you read your email, categorize each as Read. Then the text of your read email would be colored to match the category color. Again, this is not the optimum way to manage email. \nIf someone knows a better way I am interested to read it.\n\nA: Based on further research and discussion, it sounds like this feature does not exist at the current time.\n", "Q: So how do you re-download movies now?

My Macbook Pro will not sleep even though it is set in System Preferences → Energy Saver.\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not have any sharing options enabled (System Preferences → Sharing).\n\n*I do not have \"Wake for network access\" enabled (System Preferences → Energy Saver).\n\n*It does not matter if the Mac is connected to a power source.\n\n*I've reset the SMC and the PRAM, but this did not help.\n\n\nI'm running OS X 10.7.3.\n\nA: Another safe boot revealed that the auto sleep mode actually is working. I believe that it would probably have worked the last time I've tried it as well  - but, since the sleep occurs several minutes later than the time defined in the Energy Saver settings, I did not notice this.\nWhat about the 'normal' boot? \nI've basically tested the auto sleep with all my menu extras enabled one by one, because the iotop command mentioned by @StuWilson didn't show anything helpful to me. As it turns out the menu extra Stack Exchange Notifier caused insomnia.\n\nA: The biggest cause of macs not entering idle state is usually disk activity.\nI'd suggest that you boot into Safe Boot mode then use Activity Monitor to see if any processes are causing IO operations.\nIf you do see activity then try using iotop in terminal, it will give you a breakdown of Process ID (PID) and the app or process name doing the IO operations.\nsudo iotop -C 5 10\n\n\nA: This might not be your problem, but I've had the same issue for a long time and couldn't find an answer for me, so I'll post what worked for me in case someone comes along later.\nMy MacBook Pro (and later, my iMac, since I used Migration Assistant) would not sleep when left idle for anything. It would sleep with the lid closed, or if I explicitly told it to, but would not sleep when left alone, as it should have per my preferences in Energy Saver.\nI had already checked pmset -g assertions and turned off sharing and other wake-on-LAN settings, and nothing seemed to work. Monitoring pmset -g pslog, I found that the computer would go to sleep at the scheduled time, and wake back up a few seconds later, reporting as wake reason only whatever had been called last—even if it was the power button (that is, it said I had pressed the power button when I had not. That scared me). I had read this and a dozen other answers and forums and couldn't get anywhere. \nI found a hint by checking pmset -g log which was a little more detailed than pslog. It turned out that every time the computer went to sleep, a process \"cancelled\" like so:\n3/13/13 12:00:12 AM CDT  Sleep                  Software Sleep Sleep: Using AC                                              6492 secs \n3/13/13 12:00:12 AM CDT  Cancelled              Kernel: Response from WDDMService is to cancel state change                 \n\nLooking up WDDMService in Activity monitor, it turned out to be a background daemon that was installed by the notorious \"SmartWare\" that came on a Western Digital External drive. So I killed the process, and the computer went to sleep as it should! Since I don't use the software, I removed it from launchd (which I think it called the .plist? I didn't really know what I was doing there) so it wouldn't appear again. Everything works fine now!\n\nA: I had the same problem in Mavericks with a brand new Macbook  Pro Retina (Late 2013).  When I closed the lid and left the laptop closed overnight it never went to sleep.  In the morning, the battery would be dead or very low.\nAs it turns out... my problem was due to a piece of software installed by my company's IT:\nSymantec Encryption Desktop (SED)\nAs noted in this SED setup article:\n\nHibernation also called Safe Sleep is not supported with PGP WDE, when a Mac goes to sleep and runs out of battery power the Mac will shut down and not go into safe sleep. It’s important to turn off the machine if it will run out of battery power\n\nHere is Symantec's official reason why\n\nPGP Whole Disk Encryption is not supported with hibernation mode in the Mac OS X. In Mac OS X, an image file is created upon hibernation of the system. Once power is restored, the state of the system is restored, including any open programs or other processes that were running. The location of this file is in /var/vm/sleepimage and is the size of RAM memory on the system. \nThis mode may be referred to as Safe Sleep, Deep Sleep, or Hibernation. This is not the normal Sleep mode in which the power can remain on, but the system is essentially idle. This mode does not keep an image of the processes, but rather the information is stored in the RAM memory. \nThe Mac OS X operating system does not support foreign file systems for hibernation. Mac OS X Hibernation mode is not supported with \"boot != root\". This \"boot != root\" is essentially the system used by Mac to boot a foreign file system. For PGP Whole Disk Encryption to boot a system, a special file system is used which is considered foreign. As PGP Whole Disk Encryption is considered a foreign file system, hibernation mode is not supported by the Mac OS X. \nAs a safeguard to prevent system issues and data loss, PGP Desktop disables the hibernation mode on Mac OS X. Although Sleep will still work, deep sleep does not build a sleep image. \n\n", "Q: Can I see detailed browser history on the iPhone? I have an iPhone 4 on iOS 5.1. When I go into Safari's History page, I can see my browsing history by day, but I need to know what page I visited two days ago, at a specific time. Is there any way that I can do this?\n\nA: Mobile safari does not have that feature and the application sandbox means you likely won't get at that data from another app running on the device without jailbreaking.\nMany tools can export the browsing history to your computer - the trial version of PhoneView might be good to start and see if that meets your needs.\nHistory files in particular are stored as .webloc files. \n\nA: You mean the time as in which hour and minute? As far as I know, there's no way to do this. I don't think this is possible in Safari desktop either.\n\nA: Here is a solution : \n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your iPhone to iTunes. \n\n*Explore the backup. To do so, iExplorer is nice. If necessary, export the file History.plist and view it with TextWrangler.\n\n", "Q: Accesing files with Mac not booting Is it possible, say with Lion recovery partition or any other way, to access individual files on the hard drive to copy them before reformatting it to do a clean install?\nIt is not possible to boot Mac OS in \"any flavor\" as it always fails loading kernel - including safe mode or single user. \nIt is an early MacBook Air, so it is not possible to use \"Target Disk\" mode.\n\nA: You can boot your system from a system installed on an external drive. If your internal drive isn't damaged it will mount and you can copy files off of it.\nIf you have a Lion recovery partition you can use Disk Utility to \"image\" the main partition of your drive onto an external device before you format and reinstall. You will have to restore this image onto another device before you can pull files off of it.\nIt is arguably eqsier reinstall Lion directly on top of the existing OS which should create a bootable system without overwriting your files–but to be safe, make a backup image before doing this.\nInsert mandatory lecture about the importance of a good backup strategy which should make emergency measures like this largely unnecessary. \n\nA: I have just realized that when booted with Lion Recovery Partition it is possible to run Terminal. It is available in Utilities* menu.\nYou have your hard drive(s) already mounted in /Volumes and you can plug your USB drive and copy your files using Terminal. Life (or at least data) saved.\n*or at least I think it is Utilities - I have a non-English locale.\n", "Q: I am trying to run the iOS simulator I am trying to run the iOS simulator on my mac but I can't find it when i search in spotlight.

Click the Run button in the upper-left hand corner of the window.\nNote that you can chose which iOS device to simulate as just to the right of that button.\nIf you would like just the iOS simulator, you can open XCode, create an iOS app from a template, run the app, then, with the simulator running, pin it to your dock.\nThe app itself appears to be in\n/Applications/Xcode/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iOS Simulator\n\n", "Q: How do I highlight PDF text properly in the Preview application? I've been using the Preview application to view and annotate PDF files for quite a while. You can use Shift-Command-A to display the Annotations Toolbar. Then you can select the Highlight tool and choose a color (such as yellow for a standard highlight color).\nStrangely, the highlighting tends to get lighter after I save and re-open a file and I can't figure out why. It may be that the highlighting gets lighter with each repeated Save of the PDF document, or that the older highlights are being made lighter for some reason.\nIn other words, the new highlights that I create look fine. And even after I save the document they appear to be fine. But if I look at the highlighting that I did yesterday on the same document (with the exact same settings), those highlights are in a much lighter shade of yellow. This is sort of defeating the purpose of highlighting the text since I can barely tell that I did so.\nI think this only tends to happen on OS X Lion and may be a byproduct of some of the new save functionality. If there is an option to turn of \"Highlight... um... lightening\" then please feel free to let me know. I'll also take recommendations for a better method to annotate PDF files more effectively.\n\nA: This seems to be a bug in Preview. There's a related thread about this topic in which many people say they are experiencing the same problem. I too have just tested it out and see the same results.\nThere are 2 workarounds I can think of. The 1st is to select all the annotations and set their color manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the annotations toolbar.\n\n*Press the right-most button which will show you a list of all the annotations.\n\n*Select all the annotations.\n\n*Choose a new color from the annotations toolbar.\n\n\nThe 2nd workaround is to use the Python script from the same thread previously mentioned.\n", "Q: Unknown Error Occurred (-54) Enabling iTunes Match I just added my Apple ID to a new MacBook Pro and tried to turn on iTunes Match.  This is the error I get:\n\nThe only info I can find indicates this is a connection error, but I can connect to other areas of the iTunes Store.  Any ideas how I can resolve this?\n\nA: According to this discussion or this one it seems (-54) is a file-lock problem. The proposed solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*an AppleScript to remove locks  \n\n\nOpen the Script Editor in the /Applications/Utilities folder and run the following:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n  set locked of every item of entire contents of folder \"Music:iTunes\" of home to false\n  end tell\n\n\n*use Terminal to ensure ownership, group, and permissions are correct\n\n\n*\n\n*use sudo chown your-username your-filename if you don't own the file/folder\n\n*use sudo chgrp staff your-filename if it isn't set to the same group as other iTunes items\n\n*use chmod 666 your-filename and/or chmod 777 your-folder-name to make sure everyone (and thing) can edit\n\n\n*disabling FileVault if used\n\n\nIn particular, check the permissions on the iTunes/Download folder which is where iTunes will first attempt to download \"matched\" songs.\n\nA: Check out this video and see if it solves your problem.

We all know iOS devices can't support Flash, but how much is just the restrictions placed on the OS? Is it possible to install it with a jailbroken device?\n\nA: The answer to your question is \"No.\"\n\nA: The short answer is no. However, Flash was available for JailBroken iOS devices under a tweak called Frash, but it's long since been outdated, forgotten, and abandoned, plus it doesn't work on iOS5. It used to only play videos, and games would hardly run (or make it crash). So yes, it was possible, for it has been done before, but you cannot at the moment. Adobe's discontinuation of support for the ARM Flash Player will retard further development of Frash even more than it already has been.\n", "Q: What file types can you convert from a Mac to Windows? What types of files can I change from Mac- to Windows-based file types? What types \"just work\" on both systems? What types are simply non-transferable or won't work when moved between the OS types?\nIn particular, I am interested in these three file types: .ess, .app, and .bak.\n\nA: Files are files. \nWhat matters is can the Windows app of your choice make sense of specific files your Mac has created. (Unless I misunderstand what direction you are creating and then sending the files.)\nText encodings and things like that are all standard, and even binary files are well established. A Mac knows if a file is a Windows executable and hands them off to whatever program on the Mac can run them (such as VMware or Parallels virtual machines). The only files that are \"Mac\" or \"Windows\" are the executable programs - and even then, on a Mac an application is really a folder of files structured in a specific layout and you can read many of the resources and auxiliary files with no translation needed on a PC.\n\nA: Your question is very general so here is a general answer:\nDocument files are all dependant on the software for compatibility, not the operating system. So files like .doc .docx .pdf .txt .rtf etc are all compatible with Windows and Mac. This is the same for files like Photoshop files or Powerpoint files. \nVideo files are dependent on the codecs installed on the machine; both Windows and Mac have almost the same codecs installed by default. To view .mov files on a Windows machine you need Quicktime installed. .mp4 or .mpeg files will all work natively.\nImage files will all work on both systems. eg .jpeg/.jpg, .tiff/.tif, .gif, .png, etc.\nApplications are NOT inter-compatible. You cannot run a .app file on Windows, and you can't run a .exe on a Mac (except in a Windows VM or possibly Wine).\nAs a general rule of thumb, if you have a file that needs software to open (eg a Keynote presentation) then you would need the same software to open it on the other Operating system (in this case, Windows). Since Keynote is a Mac only product, you won't be able to open it on a Windows machine. In some of these cases, it could be possible to convert the file so it is openable by Windows software; in this case, you'd export the Keynote as a PowerPoint file for use on Windows.\n", "Q: OS X lion and SSD I recently got a Crucial M4 SSD for my mid-2009 MacBook Pro 13\" (2.53 GHz).

Taking a quick look at Anandtech's review of the M4, your numbers don't look out of line.\nhttp://www.anandtech.com/show/4253/the-crucial-m4-micron-c400-ssd-review/3\nThe only easier way to make things snappier is to upgrade to a larger drive.\nYou need to be aware of performance over time.  Since TRIM is not running, you are depending on the drive's garbage collection to maintain performance.  There are ways to implement TRIM on Lion for non-Apple SSD drives but reviews are mixed.  No idea how effective GC is on the M4 when using it with OS X.\n\nA: Your SSD's link speed is limited by the troughput of the SATA interface and the protocol overhead.\n\n\n*\n\n*SATA 3 (6 Gbit/s): max. 600MB/s\n\n*SATA 2 (3 Gbit/s): max. 300MB/s\n\n*SATA 1 (1.5 Gbit/s): max. 150MB/s\n\n\nA document by the Serial ATA International Organisation says:\n\nWhat’s the real-world data transfer rate of SATA 6Gb/s?\nAnswer: The realizable transfer rate across a 6Gb/s SATA link depends on the efficiency of the controller design on both the host and device sides of the interconnect. The SATA 6Gb/s interface transmits information at 600MB/s, however not all 600MB/s are realized as the user data payload because the protocol includes other data and handshaking communications between the host and device. In general, the SATA interface is very efficient. Realized transfer rates are typically very close to the theoretical maximum, which is one of the primary benefits of SATA technology for mass storage devices.\nWhat overhead brings the 6Gb/s transfer rate down to the real-world throughput?\nAnswer: There are two general categories of overhead that come into play: a communication used to send commands and receive status, and a low-level communication that handles handshakes between the host and the devices to assure the integrity of the transmission.\n\nIt's best to compare your throughput rates with that of other Crucial M4 users. An optimal comparison would compare disks using the same firmware, benchmark tool and SATA interface.\nHowever, the best comparison I found is a thread on forum.crucial.com. In this thread users are comparing Crucial M4 128GB (firmware 009) speeds on a SATA 2 interface. Even though you are using a different firmware, the results should be somewhat comparable because the firmware update 0309 was not aimed improving transfer rates. Judging by this thread, I'd say that your throughput is fine.\nThe only way to get the promised speed of the Crucial M4 is by using a SATA 3 interface.\nIn my MBP I'm currently using a Crucial M4 128GB (firmware 0309) with a SATA 3 interface. The Black Magic Speed Test gives me:\n\n\n*\n\n*max. 510 MB/s read\n\n*max. 190 MB/s write\n\nA: The existing answers are good, but don't really mention one last thing which I will include here just to have it mentioned for completeness.  Any speed ratings given for SSDs are an indication of the relative data transfer speeds of the controller built into the drive, not the actual drive.  Now unlike a normal spinning platter drive where the controller stuff is largely on the motherboard and the drives are (caching aside) simply storing and retreiving your data, the controller on an SSD drive has more capabilities, and that is the ability to compress/decompress your data on the fly on the way in/out.\nSo, if you send over a carefully formatted data file that is easily (de)compressible then the controller will do so, and this may mean that ignoring the amount of read/write that is has actually done, it's figures may seem inflated.  To get 500Mb/s you need these conditions.  It's a bit confusing, but in order to present such a speed it won't actually have written at that speed, merely compressed and written (say it get's a 50% reduction/increase in size, then that's an effective doubling of data transfer).\nObviously this is a bit of chicanery, but they all do it.  A more interesting stat are the IOP figures, but thats another story.\nBlack Magic is a truer test, because it uses data that cannot be compressed on the fly to increase transfer speeds as it already is heavily compressed.  It gives a truer representation of your capabilities, and getting 250Mb + on a SATA2 line is actually pretty neat.\n", "Q: How to move window to different desktop via keyboard in Lion? In Snow Leopard, to move a window to a different space, I had to use the mouse to select the window and use the keyboard to select the target space (e.g., ctrl + 1,2,3).\nIn Lion, what keyboard (maybe in slight conjunction with mouse as before) shortcuts can I use to move a window to a different desktop?\n\nA: Here is a mouse-less solution, using BetterTouchTool. You can assign a keyboard shortcuts to move the windows across desktops. In my case I use ctrl+shift+arrow.\n\n\nA: You can also (without modifying system settings) click and hold the window, hold down the control button, and drag to the edge of the screen.\n\nA: Pressing the shortcuts for changing desktops while dragging a window should still work, but the shortcuts have to be enabled in System Preferences.\n\nSizeUp supports for example assigning ⌃⇧→ to moving a window to the next desktop.\n", "Q: Third party Skydrive client for Mac Are there any third-party programs for Microsoft Skydrive (but for Mac)?\nSkydrive offers 25GB of free cloud storage.\nThere is a third-party app for windows that can access Skydrive. \n\nA: Looks like Microsoft just released an official SkyDrive App for Mac according the the MacObserver's article. So there may be less of a need for a third party one, check it out.\n\nUsers looking for online storage and syncing that don’t want to go the Dropbox route can now check out Microsoft’s SkyDrive app, released Monday for Windows and OS X Lion (via The Verge). The app ties into Microsoft’s existing SkyDrive service and offers Dropbox-like file management and syncing with 7GB of free storage and the option to add 20, 50, or 100GB of additional storage for US$10, $25, or $50 per year, respectively.\n\n\nA: It is impossible for someone to be for sure. However, my research on this topic has shown that there are no publicly available native Mac clients for SkyDrive. I'd love to be proved wrong! It is reported that Microsoft is developing one.\n\nA: Microsoft might be developing a Mac client, based on a statement they made in August. They have an iOS app already in iTunes, so it is possible they might make a Mac app, too.\nIt's unlikely there will be a  3rd party client until Microsoft makes it clear whether or not they will developer their own and what the features will be.\n", "Q: Using existing DVI/VGA monitors with a new Mac Mini I currently have a PC with dual monitors. This PC is on it's way out and I want to replace it with a new Mac Mini, using my existing peripherals. The current monitors are a 27\" Dell (2560x1440) running on dual link DVI and a smaller, much older, 19\" (1280x1024) running on a VGA cable. I was thinking that I should be able to run the VGA monitor with adapters HDMI -> DVI -> VGA using the included HDMI -> DVI adapter and buy the mini DisplayPort -> dual-link DVI adapter to connect the Dell monitor to the Thunderbolt port.\nI'm not sure that all these adapters will work together properly though, so I'm looking for some advice. Will this all work together properly, or will I have to get a new monitor(s) as well?\n\nA: The mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter will work great, so your 27\" monitor is in. \nThe VGA monitor is problematic. HDMI and DVI share almost identical digital video signals, so any HDMI to DVI adapter (like the included one) has few (if any) conversion chips in it and the output DVI port will be DVI-D (digital only). DVI to VGA adapters also don't have conversion chips because they use DVI-I or DVI-A ports (A is analog only and I id both analog and digital): they take the DVI analog signal and move it straight to the VGA port. Unfortunately, that means that you cannot go from HDMI to VGA via DVI. You'll need a more expensive converter like this or this. \ntl;dr: You can't go from HDMI to VGA without a converter; see the links for examples. For the dual-link DVI you need, the adapter you mentioned that will use the Thunderbolt port will work excellently.\n", "Q: Helvetica font rendering issue on MacBook Leopard So I have just re-installed Leopard on my MacBook and recovered from my Time Machine only to find I have font rendering issues with the Helvetica font:\n\nThis happens in browser or in apps like Mail.

I guess the baseband to high.\n\n\nI also know it's next to impossible to unlock such a device. But I'm sure someone in this community knows a way around.\nI'm prepared to give 50 reputation (whenever I can) to whom can guide me to install the iPhone (so I actually can use it and see the SpringBoard) and another 50 to whom can tell me how to unlock this device.\nSo any suggestions at all are most welcome!\nHere is a picture of the lock-screen:\n\n\nA: Edit 2012-04-22:\nAs of today you can unlock any jailbroken iPhone:\nhttp://laforeta.blogspot.co.nz/2012/04/how-to-spoof.html\n\nWhat do you need: A jailbroken iPhone that can be activated in iTunes (that is, not officially blacklisted), a computer with the latest iTunes installed and working internet connection.  You will also need to know the carrier that your iPhone is locked to.\n…\nYour phone will work normally with your SIM card and that SIM card ONLY since we have tricked iTunes to think that ICCID is one of the intended carrier's. The phone can be rebooted and connected to iTunes freely without losing the \"unlock\", at least for now.\nSince it does not involve emergency numbers or IMSI spoofing it will not have any of the issues associated with SIM interposers. Tested working on iOS 5.01 but should work with tethered 5.1 too.\n\n\nYou could check on the official German T-mobile site at what date you can legally unlock your iPhone.

Then you would restore the iPhone via iTunes and have the SIM-lock removed.\nhttps://t-mobile-simlockportal.arvato-services-mocom.com/pubsilo/Home.aspx\nTo install the phone you could get a German T-mobile prepaid SIM-card; e.g. from ebay.de - current offers - I think even a de-activated one should work for the installation as only the country-/provider-code is checked.\n\nA: In response to the 'sites' unlocking the iPhone- the places that offer it as a service who aren't Apple do it via jailbreaking - the only way to unlock an iPhone that has been classified as locked by Apple servers is by stopping the iPhone 'calling home'. \nIn terms of unlocking your iPhone, as legally unlocking it isn't an option (above), you may as well jailbreak it yourself, for free.\nThis website seems to have good instructions - I've followed them before when I jailbroke my old iPhone, but its worth bearing in mind that a) jailbroken phones seem slower and b) the 5.1 jailbreak is tethered. \nLast point (in a somewhat disjointed answer) if you want to restore the iPhone sans-SIM, use XCode's device manager. \n\nA: Their are different sites who can unlock your iPhone for a (little) amout of money.

For the past week or so, the mac boots fine, and then sometime during the day starts generating \nAn unexpected error occurred (error code -50).\n\nerrors when iTunes attempts to save its library file.\nChecking reveals that the boot drive (main drive, in the laptop) behaves as if it is write-protected - I get the same error code when I attempt to create a folder on the desktop, for instance. If I attempt to create files via the terminal, e.g. via\n    ls > foo.txt\nI get an \"invalid argument\" error. \nI've set the iBook to run in Target Disk Mode and run Disk Utility to repair the disk (from a Macbook running Snow Leopard) and get \"The volume appears to be ok\". \nI don't have the option in Disk Utility to Repair Permissions in Target Disk Mode. When I ran Repair Permissions on the iBook itself, it came back with no errors, no permissions corrected, but did not in fact fix the problem.\nRebooting always solve the problem - for the next 5-10 hours or so. \nWould Disk Warrior help, or some other software fix, or is it time to buy a new drive? (And, in any case, what's going wrong?)\n\nA: Error 50 is a generic - iTunes has failed to write a file and the article listing specific store errors (expand the section on Specific Conditions and Alert Messages to reveal -50 in that section) deals with the usual problems where the store is failing or the network is failing.\nIf the error is bubbling up from the filesystem (or you get the error from Finder), then it's often an \"illegal\" character in the file or folder name. Look to remove or rename files with emoji, unicode characters or more mundane characters like : & or /\nIn your case, it's very likely the drive is the cause. You can and should look in the console app to see what other errors happen around that time. Look for I/O errors - disk0 - or just run disk utility and have it verify / repair the catalog file. This will confirm the guess that the drive is failing and the errors are not some software problem.\nYou could export the current library xml to the desktop and start over with a brand new iTunes library file just to rule out corruption in that file, but then you would have two problems at the same time - terminal unable to write a file and iTunes unable to write a file. Occam's razor (and my experience) says it's the filesystem/drive - not two identical software problems.\nSpinning hard drives do track the sectors where a bad write has happened and try to keep track of them so the system won't notice files not vein written, but as a drive ages (or if this mechanism fails) you will get unrecoverable errors more and more.\nAlso - it's often hard to tell if the catalog structure is bad (which Disk Warrior, Drive Genius and plain old erase in Disk Utility attempt to fix assuming the drive works properly). But if the underlying hardware is failing, you'll need to move to a new drive. \nI would just make another backup and zero the drive and look for errors during the zero / reinstall. If the errors persist, it's time for a new drive once the pain of reboots is more than the cost of a new part costs. \nIn your specific case of an old PPC machine where repair is invasive and the cables likely to be brittle, I would just re-install the OS onto an inexpensive and many GB external drive and run the mac from a cheap USB drive (most iBooks will boot from USB, but not all will) - leaving the potentially failing internal drive sitting unused, unmounted and spun down. It's rare for a failed drive to take down the machine so you can just leave it alone for minimal cost if you can tolerate the iBook running on an external drive.\n\nA: Error -50 in relation to Mac OS X or OS X\nThe error: \n\n\n*\n\n*relates to the file system\n\n*may occur with a good file system on a good drive. \n\n\nSharing\n\n… Tiger to serve iTunes …\n\nThat's open to interpretation. \nConsidering the range of situations – not limited to iTunes – in which issues occur, I imagine that: \n\n\n*\n\n*with Tiger on the iBook G4, you use the Sharing pane of System Preferences to share a folder\n\n*with Snow Leopard on the MacBook, you prefer iTunes to write its library to part of that shared folder. \n\n\nIf so, then you should take care with: \n\n\n*\n\n*the numeric IDs of all users of iTunes\n\n*at the iBook, the ID of the user where you find issues with the home directory\n\n*at the iBook, the permissions of all folders and subfolders that you wish to be writeable by remote users of iTunes. \n\n\nHint: the ability of Disk Utility to verify permissions does not extend to situations such as this. \niTunes aside, the question makes me wonder whether ownership is as it should be on the iBook. An issue might arise if, say, a home directory was copied from one Mac to another without attention to numeric IDs of users. \nSuggestions\nAt the iBook, with Terminal, command: \nls -n ~\nls -dn ~\nls -dn ~/Desktop\nFor each of the three outputs: in the third column, note the numeric ID of the owner. \nThen: \ndscl . -list /Users UniqueID\nDoes the numeric ID match? \nAnd so on … consider the numeric ID of each remote user of iTunes. \nReference\ndscl(1) OS X Manual Page \n\n\n*\n\n*in this case, the version of the page for Mac OS X version 10.4-intel may be equally good for Tiger on PowerPC.\n\n\nA: It's a bug in fseventsd. For an external drive or secondary (non-boot hard drive), the fix is easy. Drop into the command line and sudo remove the .fseventsd of the offending drive. To do it, you'll need to run an rm -Rf which is an extremely dangerous method of deleting something if you do not know what you are doing, as it will delete with extreme prejudice.\ne.g.: cd into the drive cd /Volumes/(drive name), then run: sudo rm -Rf .fseventsd\nIt will delete the fseventsd cache and you will be good to go. Unmount the disk and remount it and it will work immediately.\nThere is an alternative workaround where you can remove that directory, then create your own .fseventsd directory, which you will put inside a file called no_log\nThat will stop the system logging events to the drive.\nYou can try other fixes such as writing to defaults various instructions but this is the simple fix to get you unstuck.\n", "Q: How to stop being asked the same Firewall related question each time iTunes launches \nPossible Duplicate:\nAlways Asked to Configure Firewall for iTunes \n\nEvery time I open iTunes (version 10.6) I'm asked \"Do you want the application “iTunes.app” to accept incoming network connections?\"\nIf I reply 'allow', iTunes works normally.

When the peripheral device is connected directly, there is no problem. Hoever, when I use a dock extension cable, a strange harmonic noise is introduced. I have tried extension cables from different manufacturers, and even the highly rated dockXtender extension cable made by CableJive introduces the noise. \nThis is somewhat strange as the analogue-to-digital (bear with my British English) converter is built into the peripheral device. This is not analogue noise picked up in the cable as the signal is pure digital on route to the iPhone. The noise seems to be introduced in the digital domain. I recorded a sample of audio in my office and analysed it using Matlab. The noise fluctuates in amplitude, but it is clearly a harmonic complex with a very precise 1-kHz fundamental frequency. The ADC reportedly samples at 44.1 kHz, so it is particularly strange that the harmonic noise comes in with a periodicity that is not even an intiger multiple of the sampling period. As a side note, I have heard a similar harmonic noise in the past emitted from some laptop sound cards (specifically Vaio C1s models).\n\nGiven that the noise never fluctuates in frequency, testing has shown that I can remedy the problem by pre-processing with a fractional delay filter based on the information here . . . \nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=951433\n. . . but this is a computationally expensive filter to implement.\nPrevention is better than cure. My question is, what is the origin of this strange harmonic noise and if possible, how do I remedy it so that I do not have to waste processing power implementing an additional filter?\n\nA: Since the A-D conversion is happening at the peripheral end, then the noise must also exist there.\nWithout access to the device for disassembly, I can only guess at the problem, but it's likely to be due to one or more of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The peripheral is probably fully shielded internally from the microphones through the ipod connector.  When you connect an unshilded extender cable, external environmental noise is coupled into the device through the cable.  You might be able to confirm or dismiss this if you perform tests in electrically quiet areas - out in the middle of a field away from powerlines, for instance.\n\n*The peripheral has \"just good enough\" filtering, but once you add the extra length of wire reflections - which don't affect the USB signal - start to cause ground bounce or other EMI.  There's no easy way to test for this without an oscilloscope and/or signal analyzer.\n\n*The peripheral has a 1kHz switching power converter (which may be required if, for instance, it used electrostatic microphones, certain high performance microphones, or provided \"phantom power\") and the extra cable length on the switching converter's input results in power signal reflections which would normally be clamped by the iOS device's power filters when they are electrically close.  This too would require specialized equipment to test for.\n\n*There are high impedance lines usually shorted out in certain configurations in the peripheral to tell the iOS device how it plans to start communicating and what it requires in terms of power and communications.  It's possible that lengthening those lines, being high impedance, couples noise into the peripheral.\n\n*This could be a typical ground loop problem.  Simply adding a several longer ground wires, if they aren't correctly connected at the peripheral end, will cause odd current flow and may result in ground noise at the far end.\nIf you know which wires in the cable the peripheral actually uses (probably USB, power, and the serial wires) then you can probably craft a cable that would suit your needs and eliminate most of the above problems.  You'd have to short the sense pins correctly at the iOS device end to eliminate the high impedance issue, and shield even the digital pins to eliminate EMI problems.  You'll need to short the appropriate ground pins at both ends (be careful here - in some cases you want a separate ground wire - again, a careful analysis would need to be made of the peripheral to determine the correct way to short ground pins).\nBy eliminating the 20+ wires you don't need, and by shielding the remainder you might be able to eliminate all of the above problems.\nHowever, unless Tascam comes out with their own extension cable, it's a long, difficult process.  I'd suggest contacting them, showing them your results, and discussing possible solutions with them.\n\nA: What you are picking up is EMI from USB frame sync (most probably through the ground wire):\n\nEvery millisecond (12000 full-bandwidth bit times), the USB host transmits a special SOF (start of frame) token, containing an 11-bit incrementing frame number in place of a device address. This is used to synchronize isochronous data flows. High-bandwidth USB 2.0 devices receive 7 additional duplicate SOF tokens per frame, each introducing a 125 µs \"microframe\" (60000 high-bandwidth bit times each).\nUSB 2.0 added a PING token, which asks a device if it is ready to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair. The device responds with ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate. This avoids the need to send the DATA packet if the device knows that it will just respond with NAK.\n\nThis could be avoided with a properly shielded extension cable. Note that even dockXtender only shields some of the wires:\n\nA revolutionary 2-tier shielding system puts all video and audio signals inside a separate shielding to reduce interference from the other signals traveling through the wire.\n\nIf you're the DIY type of person it should be quite easy to make your own extension cable using high quality shielded wires. You will probably only need to connect just a few of the 30 pins: USB (power, gnd, data+/-), all GNDs and maybe accessory/serial (enable, rx/tx). Make sure you also shield the soldering on the connector.\n\nA: Given that this is a highly technical question and that you have done considerable work in documenting the problem, I suggest you take this up directly with the Tascam company's technical support staff. At the least, they would appreciate knowing about this problem.\n", "Q: Can I put this RAM into my iMac 27\" mid 2010? (Corsair CMSO8GX3M2A1333C9) I have an aluminium iMac (from mid/late 2010 I believe).\nI want to upgrade the memory from 4gb to 8 or 16. I'm no hardware guy, but from the info I read it would appear I can upgrade to any SO-DIMM RAM module.\nSo just to check before I go ahead and buy... do you guys believe that this will go in my iMac?\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B002YUF8ZG/ref=asc_df_B002YUF8ZG6968622?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&tag=googlecouk06-21&linkCode=asn&creative=22206&creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG\nThanks\n\nA: Apple's memory upgrade page for your model iMac calls for PC-10600 SO-DIMMs.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4255\nThose Corsair SO-DIMMs meet all the stated specifications, even though some sites erroneously list them as PC-10666 (Corsair lists them as PC-10600).\nFurthermore, if you look through the reviews on Newegg and other sites for this memory, you can see reports of people using it successfully in their Macs.\nSo I would conclude that yes, it's safe to use it in your 2010 iMac.\n\nA: According to Apple's support pages, the Mid 2010 has four slots for 1333 MHz DDR 3 modules. Assuming that your current 4 GB are 2x2GB modules, you can install the Corsair modules for a total of 12 GB. Or you can buy four Corsair modules and throw out the 2x2GB for a total of 16 GB.\n\nA: I tried to replace all 4 slots of 2 GB each with 4 slots of 4 GB each. The iMac slowed down dreadfully. So I just replaced the two rear slots furthest from the screen to have 2 front original slots of 2 GB each and 2 new slots of 4 GB each to give me a total RAM of 12 GB and my 27 inch 2010 iMac is working very well and super fast again. \n", "Q: How to load windows 7 directly (without Boot camp) in a Mac Mini with intel processor whose Hard disk crashed and so is replaced? The hard disk of my Mac mini with 2 GHz intel processor and 4 GB RAM crashed and so I have replaced the Hard disk. How to load Windows 7 without loading Boot camp? Windows 7 original DVD is not able to boot the computer (Bootmgr missing error) and Acronis True image home boot CD (Acronis loader) (both 2011 and 2012 versions) is not able to load completely and recover a disk image. Also please advise how to update the BIOS \n\nA: Just because something isn't documented doesn't mean it is impossible, the following is true for Mac Mini's from 2010, 2011 and 2012. \nYou can install Windows alone on all three by configuring a hard drive to be MBR, setting the active partition to be the one containing the Windows folders. A Boot Manager, the 100mb partition you see on windows 7 computers, can be configured to point to this installation or better yet boot the mac holding C and boot into the windows 7 install CD. Have it repair the installation, it will create this partition pointing to Windows. \nThe drivers are difficult to find, however, you can buy a Mac and do everything needed in Windows without having to have any apple software loaded on the machine. \n\nA: I just put my Windows 7 DVD in my 2006 Mac Mini Core Solo, held C during boot and installed without any issues. Sound is not working yet, but I believe you can get it working with the boot camp support software.\n\nA: 32-bit windows is not useable with a Mac without BIOS emulation provided by Boot Camp.\n", "Q: How can I update iTunes Match from the command line? I use iTunes Match to access my iTunes library at work. I added some new music to my library (back at home) recently, but I forgot to run the \"Update iTunes Match\" command to ensure that the songs were matched/uploaded to the cloud. Now I'm at work, and my new tunes aren't in iCloud. \nI have shell access to my iMac at home using SSH. How can I tell iTunes to update my library from the command line? (I presume the answer will involve the use of osascript.)\nA side benefit of knowing this would be that I can schedule it to run nightly so this doesn't happen again, which is why I'd rather not just use VNC.\n\nA: iTunes doesn't let you AppleScript this natively, but you can use some UI scripting to 'click' the menu bar item and do it for you:\ntell application \"iTunes\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"iTunes\"\n        click menu item \"Update iTunes Match\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Store\" of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nYou can use that via SSH:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\" to activate' -e 'tell application \"System Events\"' -e 'tell application process \"iTunes\"' -e 'click menu item \"Update iTunes Match\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Store\" of menu bar 1' -e 'end tell' -e 'end tell'\n\n", "Q: Will the Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard Case \"for ipad2\" work with the new ipad? I have an ipad2, and I have this keyboard case: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/1222/8213\nWill the \"new ipad\" fit nicely into this case, physically?\nOr, if I get one of the new ipads, will I need to get a keyboard case specifically \"for new ipad\"?\n\nA: Yes, it fits. I bought the iPad 2 case and it fits my third gen iPad...$20 cheaper too :)\nThe latest generation iPad is slightly thicker then the iPad 2.\nThe iPad \"2\" is 0.34\" (8.6 mm) depth\nThe iPad \"3\" is 0.37\" (9.4 mm) depth\nOtherwise they are precisely the same width/height.\nWhile I don't have the case/keyboard you mentioned, it looks like it may fit in there. If the case has a solid nook for the iPad to fit into, it likely will get (noticably) tighter - but it entirely depends on how much gap is provided. Obviously since the new iPad hasn't been physically sold yet, there wouldn't be a way to actually test - other then measure with something like a micrometer.\n\nA: Answering my own question from the new iPad at the Apple Store. Definitively yes.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run Snow Leopard on a LATE 2011 MacBook Pro? I want to buy a new MacBook Pro, from Apple. However I want to run Snow Leopard instead of Lion.\nI did some Google searches and found a few success stories of people who got SL to run on their early-2011 MBPs. I didn't find much of any experiences of people doing the same on a late-2011 MBP though, so I'm wondering (and really hoping!) if it's possible?\n\nA: I'd like to confirm that it IS possible to run Snow Leopard on a late 2011 MBP 15\" without ANY FLAW although AppleCare technicians told me that it is not possible ! I did it on mine (CTO, 2.2 GHz i7) bought in fev. 2012 and had not the slightest issue since.\nBut from Apple side it is NOT recommended and certainly NOT supported . - But hey, my love and I have some scientific software and also Adobe products that only run smoothly on Snow Leopard and all our other Mac's in the family are on SL so I had to give it a try to stay productive. And personally, I'm not really happy with Lion, but that's an other story. - For me it's just roaring and definitely not the 'King' of the MacOs as the name suggests... \nSo here is what I did : \n\n\n*\n\n*As I couldn't lay my hands on a original MBP 15\" Install-DVD from last summer (10.6.7) which should allow you to boot the MBP15\" directly from it, I did a clean 10.6.7 install with my iMac 27\" (iMac11,1 - i7 2.8 GHz) on an external hard drive starting from a 10.6.3 iMac install DVD and applying all the updates up to 10.6.7.\n\n*Then I formatted my MBP internal drive in target disk mode and created 3 partitions (SL, Lion, Bootcamp).\n\n*Using CarbonCopyCloner I cloned the clean SL installation one the first partition of the MBP, then disconnected the laptop and booted in SL.\n\n*There was one little glitch with the splash screen resolution (not full screen) but nothing serious.\n\n*Now I ran the 10.6.8 combo update that I downloaded before cloning and did all the software updates and another reboot.\n\n*That done SL runs now without any problem - not one incompatibility issue in one month (would have been surprised because there were no major hardware changes from early to late 2011 MBP15\").\n\n*As next step I rebooted the MBP holding the alt-command-R keys to start from the Apple servers and did a new Internet install of Lion on the second partition.\n\n*And last I installed Windows 7 on the third partition reformatting it using NTFS (be careful to choose the right partition - by the way there is a fourth partition : the rescue partition created by Lion you don't want to touch).\n   Once Win7 installed I ran the Bootcamp Assistant and did all updates.\n\n\nAnd so now we have a nice triple boot MBP15\" allowing us to use all the software we need without the slightest problem. You could probably even try a quadruple boot adding a Linux partition...\nBut be careful! I wouldn't bet that this method works for all new MBP and MBA so you want to make sure your model ran with SL back in summer 2011 and had no major hardware changes before trying! You can also test booting it first from an external drive with the clean install on it.\nI neither do know if my method worked because the iMac 27\" and the MBP15\" both have a i7 Quad Core.\nthat's it, have fun!\n\nA: Snow Leopard could run on early 2011 machines because those machines were originally released with Snow Leopard. \nHowever, since yours is a Late 2011 model, a build of Snow Leopard that is compatible with your machine's hardware has never been engineered and thus would not work. \nIf you look at the kbase article, you can see that all the Late 2011 model MacBooks Pro came with 10.7.2. Snow Leopard would not know what to do with these machines.\n\nA: Here's one page which claims that Snow Leopard can be installed on a Late 2011 MacBook Pro by using the install discs of a matching Mid-2011 model (follow the link to the full page for more detailed instructions):\n\nAfter getting fed up with OSX Lion and the way it handles network shares and attached drives, I decided to look into putting Snow Leopard on my (new) Late 2011 Macbook Pro.  Apple said it was impossible due to lack of driver support, but I did not believe them.  After making a checksheet of OSX disc releases with MacBook Pro models, I realized that the discs shipped with the Mid-2011 MacBook Pros would boot on my laptop (OSX version 10.6.7).  (These discs are rare, and you MUST have the one that accompanies your MacBook Pro model, e.g. a 13 inch MBP must have the 13 inch discs, etc).  Finding these discs is the tough part. After finding the discs, just due what you would normally do to install OSX.\nSource: http://news.imodzone.net/2011/12/snow-leopard-on-late-2011-macbook-pro/\n\nAlso, this article may be helpful: “How to install Snow Leopard on a brand-new Lion-based Mac.”\nAs pointed out by Matt, installing Snow Leopard on the Late 2011 MacBook Pro is not officially supported by Apple, so there's no guarantee it will work. If you really need to be able to run Snow Leopard, you may be better off buying an older MacBook Pro; either second-hand or a refurbished one directly from Apple. The US online store's “Refurbished” page currently lists a number of MacBook Pro offers that were “Originally released February 2011.” These will come with Lion pre-installed, but will presumably still be guaranteed Snow Leopard-compatible (but ask Apple before buying just to make sure).\n\nA: Well, I still run 10.6.8 om my late 2011 17\". Before buying it new (June 2012) I tested my CCC backup on a friends late 2011 15\" i7 and it ran way better on that than my late 2008 2.5 17\" with no glitches. Now, with a 960GB SSD, a 1TB spinner and 16GB of 1600Mhz ram, it gets 11418 on GB3 multi and 3027 single core. What else could you want, apart from a Retina display, not forgetting you can install a bluetooth 4.1 card and a USB3 expresscard if necessary, and it runs 10.6.8 to 10.12.x. And you can stick 4TB or more SSD in it. Try that with anything later.\nTo bad they jammed all the ports too close together. If I ever build up enough nerve, I can always polish the CPUs and clean out the crappy, excessive thermal paste.\n\nA: I would recommend a triple boot - SL, (Mountain, etc) Lion - Bootcamp for Windows XP - 8 as recommended to me by a member of Virgin Media staff. It is the option I'm going for and would recommend. I might even get Windows to boot of a second HD installed in place of the CD drive. \n", "Q: What is the appropriate size for album art to display correctly the iPad's retina display? What is the appropriate size for album art to display correctly on the 3rd generation iPad's retina display?\n\nA: This is difficult to answer without any of us having access to an iPad with the retina display.\nTherefore, I'll suggest the resolution which Apple provides when you get your covers via the option Get Album Artwork in iTunes. I hope this is fine, as long as you do not use coverflow in full screen mode.\nThe dimensions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*max. vertical: 600 pixels\n\n*max. horizontal: 600 pixels\n\n\nIf a cover is not square, then one size dimension has less pixels.\n\n\nA: The new iPad has a resolution of 2048-by-1536.\nFor good results, I would suggest a multiple of the smaller dimension, assuming you are using square album art, which you should but isn't always the case.  This will allow for double scaling in much the same way as a non-retina enabled app will do.\nAs such, something like 768 square should yield good results.  Failing that 384 square may actually scale better (4x exactly) than something arbitrary like 600.\n", "Q: Can I change the default camera app on my iPhone? In the latest iOS update (5.1) Apple added the camera to the lock screen, so now I don't need to unlock the phone to take a picture.\nIs it possible to change which app is used for this?\nI realise that there are potentially privacy concerns around this which the default app nicely resolves by only showing those photos taken in the current session in the camera roll, but regardless, is this possible?\n\nA: As far as I know, the only way to do this is via a Cydia app called AnyLockApp. It allows you to configure the behavior of the camera button that appears on the lock screen. You can set any app to be activated by that button. See also the AnyLockApp page.\n\nSettings screen:\n\nEdit: As mentioned in the comments and by stuffe's answer, this hack will probably not work in iOS 5.1. However, this is unconfirmed. I will update this answer when I do update and jailbreak iOS 5.1.\nBesides this hack, there is no other way to change the behavior of the camera button on the lock screen.\n\nA: Other than jailbreak you are out of luck, the jailbreak version detail in another answer will likely work on 5.0.1 (double tap home to reveal the camera button and volume controls) but in 5.1 it's not a button any more, but a sliding control and as such highly doubtful that a jailbreak hack will be able to modify it's function.\n\nA: There is no native way to do that.\n\nA: *\n\n*GrabberApp from BigBoss repo for iOS 5.1 \n\n*GrabberApp + CameraGrabber from BigBoss repo for iOS 5.0.1\n\n", "Q: Can Finder delete a file directly and bypass moving it to the Trash? Is it possible to really delete a file (ie, bypass the Trash) from Finder? Currently, when I want to reclaim space from a USB drive, I rm files/folder from the Terminal, but I'd like to do it from the GUI (similar to Shift+Delete in Windows).\n\nA: No - there's no shortcut for that, but there is a services menu to extend Finder, flexibly bending it to accommodate your wishes.\nYou'll want to define a service that calls a script to rm or srm and bind the keyboard shortcut of your preference to the service.\nAutomator's built in help can assist with learning to make a service.\nAlso invaluable is the site http://www.macosxautomation.com/ which is made by the automation guru Sal Soghoian\n\nA: I came across an AppleScript that does something similar to what @bmike has suggested.

I've got a 1999 Blueberry clamshell iBook an I want to get it up and running agin. I'm wondering if I can get Mac OS 9 or OS X on it and more importantly where I could buy the software.\n\nA: The maximum OS version is 9.2.2 for Classic Mac OS or OS X 10.3.9 (Panther). I'm not sure which one to recommend. OS 9 might be faster, but OS X is certainly more powerful and will be far better supported by software (though Panther is so old that you'll have to use old versions of many apps). \nYou'll probably have to go digging on Craigslist or eBay for install discs that old. \n\nA: You may want to start by checking Low End Mac's \"Best Deals\" pages. They have one for Classic Mac OS and another for OS X 10.0-10.3. \nIt's a long-shot, but you could also check with independent local Mac shops to see if they still have old copies of OS 9 or OS X for sale (Apple Retail almost certainly will not). If nothing else, you could probably pay them to get it up and running again, which would include reinstalling the OS if necessary. However, checking it in for service would most likely cost much more than finding an old copy you can purchase and install yourself.\nOther than that, you'll probably need to follow CajunLuke's recommendation of checking Craigslist and eBay.\n", "Q: Optimizing Document Scanning in OSX I'm looking to optimize scanning with OSX's native scanner.  Ideally I would like it to be able to produce a multi-page black & white pdf that is under 1MB in size, however, I can't figure out a way to make this happen.  \nOften I'll have people send me the same document that is under 500KB, but when I print it out, sign it, and then scan it back in, it ends up being a very large document.  Also, if I set it to under 200dpi, it seems my quality suffers noticeably, and even at 72dpi (which is pretty much blurry), I end up with documents over 1MB.\nMy settings are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kind: Black & White\n\n*Resolution: 200dpi\n\n*Size: US Letter\n\n*Format: PDF (combine into single document)\n\n*All other options: None\n\n\nIs this something OSX's native scanning program is just not up to?  Are there better programs out there I should be using?\n\nA: Rather than using the native OS X scanner, I would recommend that you download the free trial of the commercial product Hamrick VueScan. I do a lot of scanning and I rely on it. It does very well in compressing text documents to small file size.\nAside from that, you should investigate what you can do with taking scans from the OS X native scanner and then running them (as TIFF, JPG or PDF) through Automator's image manipulation utilities for further compressing the images with Apple's Quartz Filters to make them smaller.\n\n\nA: I ended up grabbing PDFScanner in the Mac App Store.  It is incredibly easy to use and did exactly what I wanted.  For the same document that at 200DPI ended up at 20MB with OSX's native scanner, PDFScanner brought in at 300DPI and 500KB.\nHopefully there are still some tips on doing it natively without having to buy a separate program, but at $15 bucks, I'm pretty happy with my choice.\n\nA: I made this free tool.\nIt's made to quickly and painlessly scan documents into a PDF on the desktop (single page or multipage).

I would also like a method of indexing the NAS, as this would be particularly useful. Anyone has any suggestions on how to implement Spotlight to actually do its job locally, and even possibly on removable FW drives, or even a NAS?\n\nA: There a command line tool which you could use: mdutil.\nOpen Terminal.app application and try the following:\nTo check the indexing status (on|off) for a volume:\nthomas$ mdutil -s /Volumes/nfs-spotlight/\n/Volumes/nfs-spotlight:\n    Indexing enabled.\n\n...and to turn indexing off:\nthomas$ sudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/nfs-spotlight/\nPassword:\n/Volumes/nfs-spotlight:\n    Indexing disabled.\n\n...or even better disable spotlight activities:\nthomas$ sudo mdutil -d /Volumes/nfs-spotlight/\n/Volumes/nfs-spotlight:\n    Indexing and searching disabled.\n\nCalling mdutil without any parameter shows all the allowed parameters\nIt works with my NAS nfs mount but then it's much smaller than 100TB. It's worth a try nevertheless.\n\nA: In Yosemite: \nYou put all disks in the Privacy tab of Spotlight Preferences, that removes the index. Then you take out the startup disk only.\nSpotlight now indexes the startup disk and the backupd of TimeMachine that probably in your case is on the NAS. You can not exclude the TM backup.\nLexS\n", "Q: Dual Monitors with MacBook Pro I want to use 2 external monitors along with the MacBook Pro as one Monitor to the left of Macbook Pro, the other one on the right, with Macbook Pro in the middle. Is it possible to do that? How to achieve that?\nMy Intel Graphics is: Intel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB\nI looked over the Internet, I saw Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter and the other option was using Matrox TripleHead2Go Three-Monitor Graphics Expansion - Digital Edition T2G-D3D-IF offer dual monitor & triple monitor functionality. Is this correct? Can something like this be achieved with something similar with low budget in mind?\n\nA: DisplayLink\nDisplayLink makes USB graphics adapters for PCs and Macs. You can add as many displays as you have USB ports and processing power.\nYou would use the built in graphics card for one of your displays and use the USB graphics adapter for the other side. I would suggest using your three displays in the following order:\n\n*\n\n*Primary: MacBook Pro built in display\n\n\n*Secondary: Display connected to Mini DisplayPort\n\n\n*Tertiary: Display connected to USB graphics adapter.\nThe USB graphics adapter solution is fantastic, but it can be a little slow sometimes.\n\nA: @Matt and @bassplayer are both correct, but they do not address the links you mentioned in your question.\nThe Matrox Dual/TripleHead2Go won't work the way you want it to: it makes all the connected monitors appear to be one large monitor to the system, so you wouldn't be able to put the MacBook Pro's monitor between them. (You could, however, put it in the middle, below the big \"monitor\".)\nThe dual-link DVI adapter is designed to run one large monitor and will not run two smaller monitors. (This is because of how dual-link DVI was designed, not the adapter.)\nThe only way to get what you want is to hook one monitor up natively to the mini DisplayPort and use a DisplayLink adapter (like @Matt and @bassplayer mention) for the other. Remember that the DisplayLink-connected monitor won't have the graphics power of the DisplayPort-connected monitor, so play your games on the latter and the internal MBP display.\n\nA: I've seen something like this used and it works well. A good friend of mine has a total of 4 monitors - The MB Pro, the regular display port, and two USBs.\nThey do run between $50 and $75, but make it easy.\n", "Q: Protecting the palm-rest area of a MBP with a non-permanent cover I have a new MacBook, and love using its keyboard. However, I fear that the area where I rest my palms will get dirty over time - a shame, considering how great the unibody aluminum looks!\n\nThe industry standard of protection solutions seems to be the Moshi PalmGuard. What I don't like about it is that it's permanent: you stick it onto the machine. It promises to come off without a trace, but I would still prefer a solution that I can put in place, and remove whenever I want.\nAre there any solutions for this? I do not use the trackpad, so it could well cover the entire front area for my purposes.\n\nA: I love a clean mac and have seen all sorts of ones with all manner of paint, grease, and plain old skin oil and dirt. I would worry about the keyboard more than the palm rests. (the area with speaker perforations and the keyboard tray area)\n\nI always start with plain water to clean, then move to either alcohol or a light detergent (very watery mix) with no colors or scents if possible. I use that all over the mac - but the aluminum area you indicated is both solid and not affected by much stronger cleaners. I have seen macs with nail polish and acrylic paints come clean in that area.\nAs long as your cloth is damp and not dripping, even cleaning the trackpad area won't introduce liquid to the battery bay. It's of course best to have the mac off, just in case there is a spill to avoid a short.\n\nA: If you don't care about the trackpad, then regular plastic wrap might be a cheap and effective solution. \n", "Q: Mac App Store purchases are missing When I click on the tab Purchases in the Mac App Store, I'm missing purchases that I've never removed.\nHow can I get them back to show in the purchase history?\n\nA: In the Mac App Store go to...\n\n\n*\n\n*Store → View my account\n\n*In the section iTunes in the Cloud click on View hidden Purchases.\n\n*Choose which purchases you want to unhide.\n\n\nA: Not only have developers removed apps from the store causing customers to have their product deprecate or disappear, but Apple themself have removed stuff too, such as OS X server, renaming it to 'Server' and causing all customers who previously purchased the app, to lose their app, and their money when updating their os. This happened with iPhoto and Aperture for a while, and my latest purchase to disappear is Feral Interactive's Tomb Raider Underworld, which appears in my Purchased items list, but cannot download, because the app does not exist in the appstore anymore.\nThe problem is, none of us can afford lawyers to litigate, if not, we could sue Apple for millions for fraudulent services\n", "Q: Lightroom: I did save to catalog and I lost my changes; can I restore my changes? I'm using lightroom 3 on mac. Not long ago I did save to catalog (I don't know what it does) and apparently I didn't select all the photos I have changed.\nI opened the saved file and I've been asked if I want to close the software and to open it from this catalog. I pressed yes and I saw just the photos I'd selected before I saved the catalog. When I returned things to the last backup (from a week ago), I saw that all the changes I did from the last week were not there, even if I import a folder that I added in this week it comes up with no changes...\nIs it possible to me to restore things to the second before i saved the catalog? when all the changed was there?\nWhat does the save to catalog do?\nMany thanks\n\nA: I'm not sure what \"save to catalog\" does.  In fact I couldn't even find the command anywhere within Lightroom 4. I always import batches of photos directly into LR straight from an SD card. This automatically adds them to the catalog and saves the raw file in a separate directory.\nThe catalog is just a database which contains all the edits you do to a photo.  Any changes you make while editing in the develop module are saved the instant you make them.  You can also save the changes as XMP data which is written directly to the raw file so if your catalog ever becomes corrupt your edit data is saved.  There is an option to automatically save xmp data or you can do it manually on a photo by photo basis.\nIf you use Time Machine or another backup system you should be able to go back and restore to any saved point.\n", "Q: Two computers. Three screens - one control? I have a setup at home, where I have a laptop permanently connected to a screen, and another laptop that I take to work with me. Recently, I've started doing a lot of work using both machines at once - with the independent laptop sat underneath the major screen.\nAnyway - I'm looking for software that will let the independent laptop treat the other computer like an extension of its screen (when I want it to) which can be easily disabled and will cope alright with multiple screens. Is this possible / does a solution for this exist already?\nI've tried Apple Screen Share, which is cool but just doesn't quite cut it. \n\nA: Teleport is a free application specifically for this purpose. It allows you to use one machine as a \"host\" with one pair of a mouse and keyboard, and use it to control (over your local network) other machines just by moving your cursor to another computer (similar to how multiple displays work, except this time on separate machines). It also integrates the clipboards of the macs, allowing you to copy/paste between macs. \n\nA: Sounds like you're looking for Synergy.\nAnother option would be a product like the J5 Create wormhole.\n", "Q: How to access Journals from iCloud.com Is there a way to access Journals publish by iOS iPhoto, directly from icloud.com, without knowing the link already.\nCurrently I have to \"share the link with a friend\" before I can access it on icloud.com, even though I have already synced it to icloud.\n\nA: There is no way to directly access your Journals from iCloud.com, no. However, if you publish a Journal you can choose \"Add to Home Page\" (iPad and iPhone), that way if you have multiple Journals a visitor can navigate to your \"Home Page\".\nA visitor would still need the unique link for at least one Journal even with that option selected. Alas, there is no \"icloud.com/user/\" link one could visit directly.\nI don't think it's designed to be a landing page. It's more to generate a unique link for sharing said Journal.\n", "Q: Time Machine Drive Failure So, I started up my computer a couple days ago, and OS X reported that my Time Machine Drive had some damage and that I could view files, but not copy anything to the drive. After verifying with disk utility, I learned that the drive has an Invalid Node structure, meaning I have to reformat the drive. But here's where the problem comes in: Before I can reformat, I need to backup all the information on the drive. Time Machine uses symbolic links, so I can't just copy with the finder. I can't use Disk Utility's restore feature to copy everything on the drive to another drive, since that will also copy the damage (I know, I tried it...). I tried using the cp -R command in terminal, which I think will not copy the hard links properly, but it started giving me permission errors.\nSo, does anybody have any suggestions on how to transfer my Time Machine Backups to another drive? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I would suggest using rsync, which will sync all files and folders from a particular directory to another and skip over files it can't transfer because of damage. Use the following command to copy the entire root directory of your current Time Machine drive to a new drive:\nsudo rsync -avxr --progress /Volumes/BadDrive/ /Volumes/GoodDrive\nDue to the damage, you probably won't be able to continue using the new drive as a backup drive. It's likely that rsync will skip over some damaged files, causing OS X not to recognize it. \nAnother option would be to attempt to use Drive Genius to repair the existing drive. However, this probably won't work with an invalid node structure.\nYou could also use SuperDuper! to copy the existing files over to the new drive. However, you may run into the same problem as rsync in that it may not preserve the Time Machine file structure.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Audio output and volume controls gone after updating to iOS 5.1 I have an iPhone 4 (Verizon, Model MD146LL) and I just upgraded from iOS 5.0.1 to iOS 5.1 (9B176) using Settings > General > Software Update.\nImmediately after completing the update, I noticed that my phone did not make the unlock sound as I unlocked my phone. \"Oh, the volume must be down\", I thought. So, I made sure my mute switch was off and pressed the + button to increase the volume. Unfortunately, I was greeted by the empty ringer volume popup:\n\n\n\"Apple must have changed the default setting for the volume buttons ^^\"... Surely, I could change it myself! So, I head over to Settings > Sounds:\n\nOh, the settings are right. Hmm... What happens if I move the volume slider?\nRejoice! MARIMBA!\n\nOk, so my phone can play audio. Can it play music or watch a video?\nNo!\n\nNo!\n\nNO...\n\n\nOther controls:\n\n\n\nHoping that this was just a temporary glitch, I tried the following:\n\n*\n\n*Switching Change with buttons on and off\n\n*Turning my phone on and off\n\n*Hard reset (holding Home+Lock until it reboots)\n\n*Plugging and unplugging my earphones\n\n*Plugging and unplugging the USB charging cable\n\nPlugging and unplugging the USB cable seems to fix the issue. However, as soon as I lock the phone, the sound and volume controls are disabled again! Due to this behavior, I'm convinced that this is a software bug and not hardware related (e.g. faulty headphone jack).\nHas anyone else experienced this? I'm afraid I'm going to have to do a clean restore or downgrade back to iOS 5.0.\n\nUpdate 1:\nSettings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings was unsuccessful, even when setting up the phone as a new device (no backup). The bug is still present. I will be trying a clean restore from iTunes soon.\n\nUpdate 2:\nRestoring as a new device using iTunes was also unsuccessful. :( From my research, it looks like this bug not specific to my model:\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/message/17808462#17808462\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/message/17799461#17799461\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/message/17850153#17850153\n\nUpdate 3:\nAfter further analysis and comparison, I think that this bug is related to the External Accessory Framework (or similar components). When you are plugged into a compatible device, the controls are hidden, similar to my screenshots above. This may also explain why plugging and unplugging the charger temporarily fixes the problem. \"I'm unplugged; I should enable my volume controls now.\"\n\nA: From the fact that the issue persists across multiple firmware updates, it's almost definitely a hardware or firmware issue.\nMy first guess would be some small amount of metallic debris in the dock connector. It's likely that connecting and disconnecting the usb connection forces the software to assume that there is nothing connected, until the next time the phone wakes, when it checks if it's connected to a passive audio-out adapter.\nSome metallic debris in the dock connector could force the phone into thinking there is always a line-out adapter present.\nTry cleaning the dock connector with compressed air or a soft brush, or look into it with  bright light to see if there are any bent pins.\n", "Q: Can you stream music from an iPhone to an iPad? I'm playing with the idea of installing an iPad in my car.\nIdeally, I'd like to save the storage space for video and buy a smaller model, so I'm wondering if there is a way to play the music I have on my iPhone on an iPad via streaming or an app or other means?\n\nA: If your iPad is a 3G/Wi-Fi model, then you could conceivably do this through the music app. The reason for the need for 3G is that in order to connect these devices there must be some sort of network present.  \nThat being said, this seems like overkill. If you are using your iPad for music and only music in the car, and if you have the means and desire to pull this off, then I would strongly suggest you simply get a car stereo with a 1/8\" input auxiliary jack.  This would allow you to plug the iPhone directly into your car stereo, without any other hassle.   \nFurthermore, streaming data like this is a good way to unnecessarily rack up data usage charges, as you would be transmitting data 100% of the time. Go with the plug-n-play solution: you stream no data at all.  \nSeriously think about this. Again, it seems a bit like overkill.    \n", "Q: How to force a Time Machine deep traversal? After a few kernel panics and an accidental hot-unplugging of my Firewire Time Machine drive, I'd like to make sure that my Time Machine exactly matches my Macintosh HD, much like rsync -a.  Is there a way to force Time Machine to do a deep traversal to check that the backup matches?\nKnowing how to do this on Leopard, Snow Leopard and Lion would be useful.\n\nA: Setting the Time Machine destination to nothing and then re-setting it to the same location as before forces a deep traversal for me. You could try rebooting between the changing of the destination and the re-adding it to increase the chance of a deep traversal being triggered. \nWorst case, we could muck about in single user mode to destroy the fseventsd directory at a safe time when the system is not counting on it to be correct, so you have forced a new database that won't match. You could presumably delete this from the TM side, but I would remove the boot copy as marginally safer and less prone to destroying data you need or messing up your backup.\nIf you're inclined to use the command line / terminal, I'd start with tmutil compare before you even thing about forcing a deep traversal. It explicitly compares things as they exist now to the last snapshot and you can force things by specifying a specific external snapshot if you are worried about a local snapshot being compared.\n\nA: Booting in single-user mode may cause a deep traversal. It did for me once, but not subsequent times. Deleting /.fseventsd definitely will. It should be safe to do this in single-user mode. Deleting /.fseventd on the backup volume did not trigger a deep traversal for me. (My system continued on as normal and never even re-created it.)\ntmutil compare is only somewhat accurate. It seemed to accurately identify files that were not backed up at first. I triggered a deep traversal to correct this, but Time Machine is still not backing up many files. Yet tmutil compare now claims that there isn't a problem. I would trust:\nrsync --dry-run --itemize-changes --checksum --protect-args -aNHAXx --protect-decmpfs --fileflags --force-change --delete path/to/source_dir/ path/to/destination_dir/\n\nUse /Volumes/<your time machine volume>/Backups.backupdb/<your machine name>/Latest/ as either the source or destination path. --itemize-changes lets us see what is different; '--checksum' tells rsync to actually compare file contents, rather than just modification times and file size; and --dry-run tells rsync not to actually backup (so it just tells us what it would do). The rest of the arguments are flags telling rsync to make the destination identical to the source in every way, including metadata and HFS compression status. I believe that Time Machine adds bookkeeping metadata which it removes when restoring, so rsync may find spurious metadata changes.\n\nA: Short answer for at least macOS 10.13.6:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove any .inProgress backup from the backup volume.  This may require root use of /bin/rm -rf so proceed with caution.\n\n*Use the tmutil associatedisk command to rebind the backup volume to the main volume.  For example:\n\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a / \"/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/Macintosh HD/Latest/Macintosh HD\"\n\nThen start a backup from the Time Machine menu item.  In my case, instead of finishing the scan in 10 minutes (clearly not a full scan) and showing a terabyte to backup, the scan took over 30 and the backup size matched what tmutil compare had been saying.\nBackground:\nI needed to force a deep traversal / full scan after an rogue installer (Reallusion) changed the permissions on everything in \"/Users/Shared\" (about 1 terabyte of otherwise unmodified files).  I changed them all back, and tmutil confirmed that time machine did not need to back those files up anymore, but one of two backups disks insisted on using some cached scan that said it did.\nThings that did not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing and re-adding the backup volume from system preferences\n\n*Clearing out /.fseventsd\n\n*Installing a system update\n\n*Removing the .inProgress backup without running tmutil associated disk\n\n*Running tmutil associated disk without removing .inProgress\n\n*Booting into single user mode, mounting / as read-write, and touching a file\nIn most cases, the backupd logs would claim to be doing a deep traversal, but would take only a few minutes and then try to backup everything.  Here's the command to monitor backupd live on 10.13 at later:\n\nlog stream --style syslog --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] \"TimeMachine\"' --info\n\nThat will only show new events.  To logs from the last three days:\n\nlog show --style syslog --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] \"TimeMachine\"' --info --last 3d\n\n", "Q: Change a Mac Mission Control wallpaper using the terminal I can use Automater to change the wallpaper of the current \"space\" im in, but I can't tell it to change another space.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: This isn't automator, but works well for me.\nIn the space that you want to change the desktop, open System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Select the picture you want for that space/screen. \n", "Q: Do external web cams work with MacBook Pro? I don't like using the built-in iSight camera as I want to adjust the angle etc.  Do external web cams still work with MacBooks with built-in camers?\nI have a MacBook Pro 13\" with Snow Leopard\n\nA: Yes, most external webcams will work fine with a MacBook Pro with a built-in camera.  Just check the box for the camera before you purchase to ensure it's compatible.  Some webcams may come with bundled software which only works on Windows which is why you should check before you buy in case the software features are important to you.\n", "Q: I need a high quality web cam - what specs should I look for on the box? I need a high quality EXTERNAL web cam - what specs should I look for on the box?\nMac Book Pro OSX Snow Leopard \n\nA: Three things are important when choosing a webcam.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Resolution (number of pixels)\n\n*Framerate  \n\n*Low-light quality  \n\n\nI noticed from your previous question that you have a 13\" MacBook Pro.  This is capable of displaying 720p resolution but someone on the other end of your video call may be capable of displaying 1080p or more.  So the resolution you need depends on how you're going to use it.  If you're making videos of yourself to be edited later you might like to choose a camera that's capable of 1080p.  \nYou would need a camera with a minimum framerate of 30 frames per second (FPS) to get smooth video.  Higher would be even better.  However, be aware that some webcams will lower their resolution to obtain higher framerates so if keeping a high resolution is important you need to check what framerate the camera can sustain at each resolution.\nLow-light quality is something that a lot of webcams are bad at.  Manufacturers may make claims about their webcams which are not true so it's best to read reviews and try any webcams you're considering before you purchase.\n", "Q: Can I change the carrier name in the iPhone Simulator 5.0? I found numerous instructions to set SBFakeCarrier in com.apple.springboard plist but this doesn't seem to work with iOS Simulator 5.0. \nIs there any way to change the carrier name in the simulator?\n\nA: For my part, I was able to change the carrier name for the iPhone 5.1 simulator by editing this file:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk/System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/French.lproj/SpringBoard.strings\n\nAs the path suggests, I'm French. Switch to whichever localization you choose.\nInside this strings file (editable with XCode if it's a binary plist), you'll find a SIMULATOR_CARRIER_STRING key. Change its value, fire up your simulator, and there you go.\n\nA: I wrote a fake carrier hack for recent versions of the iOS Simulator which do not support the SBFakeCarrier hack anymore. Just compile the XCDFakeCarrier.m file in your project and change the FakeCarrier constant to what you want.\n\nA: I wrote a little tutorial that helps you change the carrier name even on iOS 6.0 and up: https://github.com/toursprung/iOS-Screenshot-Automator/blob/master/changeCarrierName\n", "Q: How do I delete Albums from Photos for synced folders that don't exist anymore? I previously used a Windows 7 desktop PC before and synced a folder of pictures to my iPod Touch 4G Photos using iTunes. Unfortunately, the desktop PC crashed and so I had to reinstall Windows 7 on my laptop.\nIn my current Windows 7 setup on my laptop, I have reorganized my folder structure which included the pictures folders.\nSo now, I want to sync to these picture folders with my iPod Touch. But first I want to delete a previously synced folder from my iPod Touch (as these will most likely duplicate pictures which are now on different folders). The problem is, I can't do that on the iPod. And I can't do that on iTunes as well because the synced to folder isn't there anymore.\nThe only thought that occurred to me is to reset the device but I don't want to do this just yet. How do I go about deleting the folder from my photos without touching the other data (e.g. Emails, Messages, etc) on my iPod Touch?\n\nA: What I did to erase photos in my iPod Touch synced to a non-existent folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Created an empty folder in my Pictures directory (eg. Temp)\n\n*Plugged in my iPod Touch, opened iTunes and went to the Photos tab and synced to the empty folder\n\n*Opened the Photos app in iPod Touch and album I wanted to remove was removed\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I want to buy an iPad charger for in my car. I have one now for my iPhone, but he won't charge my iPad. I know batteries use mAH to denote capacity, so are chargers rated by mAH or some other measure?\nWhat kind of specifications do I need to charge my iPad in my car at a normal speed (equal when connecting to the power network).\n\nA: The original Apple charger has an output limited to 2.1 A at 5.1 V. \nI occasionally charge my iPad 2 Wifi with the old charger of my passed Palm Pre. It provides an amperage of 1 A at standard 5 V USB voltage.\nI don't know if you can go even lower than 1 A, but the standard USB amperage of .5 A is not enough to charge it. It shouldn't be a problem to get a car charger that is capable of handling 1 A, more is better.\nMake sure you buy one, that is capable of charging an iPhone as Apple devices tend to observe the USB standards and try to communicate with the charger. Some dumb China elcheapo chargers may not have USB logic inside and your iDevices could refuse to charge.\n\nA: A standard USB charge should be enough to charge it, albeit very slowly.  It's important to note on a very low charge like this, often it will provide enough to either a) charge when the screen is of, or b) not charge but allow enough to run it without any change in charge levels.  In this mode, the charging indicator will always show not charging, as by definition you cannot see it when the display is turned off, but it can happily be charging while you are not using it.\n\nA: Apparently 2,1A should suffice to charge an iPad since Apple sells a similar product in his online store.\n\nDid You Notice?\n  Two USB ports with 2.1 amp output allow for the fastest possible simultaneous charging of your iOS devices.\n\n\nA: My Iphone 4 is drawing 288 mA now while it is being charged and has been drawing that amount of current for the last hour.  I have it connected to a power supply that displays the current draw.  Of course I connected the power supply to a car 12 volt to iphone adapter\n", "Q: Data Leak Prevention software for mac OSX We are using a software in window environment which provides the following feature to prevent a data leak.

I've sent DVD+R DL to a bunch of PowerPC G4/G5 users and some said the disk was ejected after few seconds.\n\nA: I noticed on some MacBooks and MacBook Pro(s), that the internal \"media/super-drives\" are very picky, especially when it comes to DVDs and other problems, which in this case are not much relevant. (Individual user experience maybe?)\n\n\n*\n\n*You can always try to use a different DVD brand/producer. That might do the trick, at least in my experience. \n\n*It sometimes is a good idea to use \"low burn speed rates\", depending on the contents you are going to burn and also to use buffer settings within the application itself, to prevent faulty sectors/errors.\n\n*Though it shouldn't be a problem at all, it is a good idea to use common applications, like \"Disk Utility.app\" or \"Toast.app\", which are common on the other users system too.\n\n\nA: If they've a PowerPC G4/G5 machine make sure 100% they do actually have SuperDrives. No SuperDrive means no DVD compatibility, and it'll eject it when it finds it can't read it.\ni.e. The iBook line didn't get SuperDrives unless they were the high end option or built to order, so there were a lot of machines out there without DVD support.\n", "Q: Is it possible to display a Smart Folder as a stack in the Dock? I'd like to have my recent files at hand from my dock, preferably via a 'stack'.\nI have already created a Smart Folder containing all my files that have been opened in the last 3 days and added it to the dock. However, I can not change the display mode: it is only there as a shortcut that opens a new Finder window.\nIs there any way to change this behavior?\n\nA: Instead of your specific recent documents search, you might also like this alternative:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{ \"tile-data\" = { \"list-type\" = 1; }; \"tile-type\" = \"recents-tile\"; }'; killall Dock;\n\nThis adds a recent items stacks to your Dock that has customizabile viewing options (grid/fan/list/automatic) like one is used to.\nThe right-click menu gives you the option to choose between recent applications/documents/servers and favorite volumes/items.\n\nA: I would love to see a workaround that makes this possible, but by default, the answer appears to be no, you cannot do this.\nIt appears that a \"Smart Folder\" isn't actually a folder, and the operating system isn't particularly smart about treating it as if it were one. It's just a text file containing a .plist with search parameters, but when double-clicked, it prompts Finder to open a window displaying the result of that search. The Dock, however, does not have that that layer of interpretation built in, so it treats it as a file (which it is), and when clicked, it opens the file, just like any other file stored in the Dock.\n", "Q: Internal IMAP server - Lion behind firewall I have the following (already given) scenario:\n\nThe primary question is - how to setup IMAP and SMTP server on the Lion for the \"mydomain.com\".

In general, never use .private and .local since you end up (eventually) in a world of hurt and doing it \"right\" isn't that hard.\nBasically, you will tell the world that your mail server resides on the public IP address (or set up it's own real routable internet IP address and have the Proxy/Firewall forward traffic to the internal fixed IP 10.1.1.20)\nThen, you will add two zones to your internal DNS so that all queries for mail.whatever.com resolve to 10.1.1.20 and a reverse zone resolves the IP to the name.\nThis way your clients will get the right address when on the local LAN or VPN in, but can still access the server from the public internet when DNS gives the public address.\nAlso look out for your server certificates. Most people issue certificates for the public IP address and have a profile to allow internal clients to trust a self-signed cert for when they hit the server locally.\nThere are no silver bullets here - the choice you make to have a more complicated routing will complicate your SSL and other server setup steps, but this is a common situation for people deploying lion server so I've seen it work well in most cases.\n", "Q: Is the iTunes Match Limit for ALL Songs or just Matched Songs? On the iTunes Match page, I see this text:\n\niTunes determines which songs in your collection are available in the iTunes Store. Any music with a match is automatically added to iCloud for you to listen to anytime, on any device. Since there are more than 20 million songs in the iTunes Store, chances are your music is already in iCloud. And for the few songs that aren’t, iTunes uploads what it can’t match (which is much faster than uploading your entire music library).\n\nand:\n\nYou can store up to 25,000 songs in iCloud (more if songs are purchased from the iTunes Store), but only what you want to play is stored on your device. So you have immediate access to a huge music library without taking up storage space.\n\nI was under the impression that this means (my interpretation):\n\niTunes will scan your whole library.  Anything found that matches something in the iTunes store will now be cloud-available for you from the iTunes store.  Anything that doesn't match will be uploaded to also be cloud-available, up to 25,000 songs.\n\nBut it looks like my interpretation is in error.  I have a library of approximately 32,000 songs, and I would estimate that a lot of it is \"available\" on iTunes (even though that's not where I originally obtained it... most of it is ripped from CDs).  And when I try to enable iTunes Match, it immediately tells me that I can't use it because I have over 25,000 songs.\nSo, it doesn't actually \"scan\" and \"match\" songs, it just blindly uploads whatever I have to cloud storage?  Or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: I think the difference is in the second paragraph that you posted. In your situation, if you have bought less then 7,000 songs from iTunes, then the rest counts against the storage.\nIn other words, it looks to me that only the songs that you bought from the iTunes store will not count against your 25,000 song limit. All other songs will (whether bought from somewhere such as Amazon, or ripped from a cd) likely count against that limit.\nKeep in mind that you can have more than one Apple ID with purchased music in a library and according to the FAQ - only the Apple ID paying for iTunes Match/Apple Music is exempted from the 25k song limit.\nIt's not clear whether Family Sharing is all considered \"one Apple ID\" so you might want to be sure you re-download all family songs under your Apple ID if you are running up against a limit.\n", "Q: How to figure out what's causing a jailbroken iPhone to crash? My iPhone 4 runs iOS 5.0.1 and is jailbroken. It has recently become unstable: it often crashes and restarts in safe mode. Then, in safe mode, I can choose to restart and it will often go right back into safe mode again. Clearly, some little cog has come loose inside.\nI haven't found a definitive action that always causes a crash. They occur sporadically, but they occur most often when I am trying to purchase or upgrade an item in the App Store. \nHow can I discover what causes the crashes?\nIs there a more elegant way to determine it than going into Cydia's list of installed packages and uninstalling the topmost one; then wait and see if it's stable now; otherwise uninstall the now-topmost package? This would probably work out eventually but it's certainly neither fun nor efficient.  \nNo, I don't keep a list of which package was installed at what date. That would make it easier to roll back a month at a time.\nPermanently reverting to a non-jailbroken device is not an option for me. The Cydia tweaks are way too convenient.\n\nA: The first thing that I would do is to check in the iPhones Diagnostics reports. In Preferences go to General>About>Diagnostics & Usage. There might be information about your crash there. Your other option is to install Crash Reporter and syslogd from Cydia. You would be able to get some information about crashes there. If you're having trouble even getting to Cydia, try disabling MobileSubstrate, those plugins tend to cause a lot of crashes on jailbroken devices.\n", "Q: Reset external monitor settings (Lion) When I plug an external monitor into my MacBook (Air, Pro... it doesn't matter), I can change the monitor's settings (resolution for example) and Mac OS X saves the configuration for the next times I plug it. Is there anyway I can reset those settings? Any file to delete?\n\nA: Locate\n    ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver(UUID).plist (may be 2x) \nas well as \n~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver(UUID).plist.lock \nPut both in trash.\nEmpty trash.\nRestart.\nThis most likely will not change your graphics settings; however, it was my experience that doing this whole process in \"scaled\" display from the beginning, allowed me to go back in to settings after restart, and choose \"Best for display\" and resolve my issue.\nYMMV\n10.9.1 - mac Mini with 2x displays; orig. issue: best for display output 'out of range' on 2nd display; native settings verified. \n\nA: Yes, you can reset your display settings by deleting a certain preference file located here:\n~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/\n\nOnce in that directory, look for a file that begins with com.apple.windowserver[long text here]. \nHOWEVER, there is a caveat.  Deleting this file can have serious consequences.  If I were you, I wouldn't mess with it.\nIf you're determined to try, then edit the file, only removing the dictionary in the plist that contains the screen settings for the external screen.  If it sounds too technical, then I wouldn't try it.  Troubleshooting a non-functional system because you deleted a system file just isn't fun.\n", "Q: Show the Mobile Safari Debug Console on demand Using the same iPad for testing and casual browsing makes the handling of the Mobile Safari Debug Console a little annoying.\nIs there any way to enable it on demand (ie on my test sites), without turning it on for all sites?\n\nA: No.\nYou can only turn it on or off, there is no way to set it only to certain sites.\nInstead of using the (limited) debug console on the iphone, try using Safari on a desktop and set the user agent to iPhone (From in the Developer Menu, to enable the developer menu, open Safari preferences and choose Advanced where there is a checkbox to enable it).\nYou should then be able to catch almost all of the console logs, as Safari and MobileSafari are naturally similar. Although there are things you will need to use the iPhone for (like viewport issues)\n", "Q: Can I Have Multiple iTunes Libraries? Is there a way for iTunes to have multiple distinct libraries?\nThe actual problem I'm looking to solve with this question stems from my desire to use iTunes Match.  It would appear that I can't use this service because my library currently has approximately 32,000 songs.\nNow, I have lots of playlists to differentiate many of the songs.  (And this problem could be very easily solved if I could just use iTunes Match on a playlist-by-playlist basis.)  But it's looking more and more like if I want to use this service then I'll need to remove approximately 7,000 songs from my library.  (Even more as I continue to add to it.)\nFinding 7,000 songs (or more) that I simply don't listen to and removing them is certainly doable.  However, I don't want to completely and utterly remove them.  They are a part of my library.  And, even though I don't listen to all of them, other people might.\nThey don't need to synchronize to my iOS devices for my personal use, but my library is increasingly becoming a shared household resource for family members and guests.  And I don't want to remove items from that selection simply because of my own personal listening habits.  (For example, I'd probably end up removing a ton of children's music that I don't listen to, but my own children are getting to an age where they can make use of such a shared resource and listen to it.)\nTo that end, is there any other way I can divide or organize my collection such that I can use Apple's cloud services to synchronize more of my own music than my devices could otherwise hold without losing the family resource I currently have?\n\nA: Hold down the Option key when you launch iTunes. You will be asked to choose an existing library, or create a new library. You can search the web for iTunes multiple libraries and find the answer.\nI suggest that you create a new iTunes library, move songs that you don't listen on a regular basis over there. If you already have them in a play list, just export them from your primary library and import in the other library.\n", "Q: Apple Remote Desktop multiple ports on one address / ip I am using Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) version 3.5.1 and I want to add computers to the list. I have several virtual machines running on an VMWare ESXi host. VMWare enables screen sharing via VNC but with different ports for different VMs.\nSo I have this:\nESXi host ip :      xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nFirst VM vnc port:  5901\nSecond VM vnc port: 5902\n....\n\nI am able to connect to each of those VMs via\nopen vnc://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5901\n\nI can also add the first VM to the ARD computer list. But when I add the second VM it overwrites the first VM because the ip address is the same. Is it possible to workaround this problem?\nThanks for your help!\nEDIT:\nI also tried to edit the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteDesktop.plist directly. Although I could create another entry which also shows up in ARD this second entry then has no network address assigned in ARD. So that does not help...\n\nA: I'm not specifically familiar with ARD, but in general Apple assumes one IP = one computer.  You'll be less likely to have these kinds of compatibility and interoperability issues if you give each VM its own IP address by using \"bridged\" networking on ESXi instead of NAT. \n\nA: If you set the VM's up with Bridged network connections rather than NAT network connections they will all get different IP Addresses on the same subnet. Best way to do it.\n", "Q: sourcing bash profile for root users Apologies in advance if this question is going to annoy the hell out of everyone as I appreciate, it's been asked in various ways many times before.  Please be assured, I have read the archives and have tried at least some of the suggestions but still cannot resolve the (simple) issue. Hopefully someone can provide an answer and I can feel appropriately humbled.  FYI, for the avoidance of any ambiguity, I'm going to use absolute rather than relative paths.\nWhen I log in, I do so as user adam.  The aliases in /Users/adam/.bash_profile are loaded and I can use them immediately upon pulling up a terminal.  I don't use a .bashrc file and that's fine.\nEvery now and then, I switch to root by typing su into the terminal and then entering my password.  The prompt changes and I am now root user.  My question is this: immediately upon becoming root, can my root bash profile be loaded without me having to manually source the profile file?  The reason I know it doesn't happen automatically is because I have the same aliases in my root profile file and my /Users/adam/.bash_profile.  After becoming root user, unless I type in source [root_profile_file], they don't work.  I have tried setting up the following permutations and then switching to root via the terminal but none of them automatically source the profile/aliases (note, I don't have any of the options below set up concurrently so I don't think I'm confusing the system):\nOption 1: put my aliases in /etc/profile\nOption 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*in /etc/profile, insert [ -r /etc/bashrc ] && . /etc/bashrc\n\n*put my aliases in /etc/bashrc\nOption 3: \n\n\n*\n\n*in /etc/bash_profile, insert [ -r /etc/bashrc ] && . /etc/bashrc\n\n*put my aliases in /etc/bashrc\nOption 4:  put my aliases in /var/root/.profile\nOption 5: \n\n\n*\n\n*in /var/root/.profile, insert [ -r /var/root/.bashrc ] && . /var/root/.bashrc\n\n*put my aliases in /var/root/.bashrc\nOption 6: \n\n\n*\n\n*in /var/root/.bash_profile, insert [ -r /var/root/.bashrc ] && . /var/root/.bashrc \n\n*put my aliases in /var/root/.bashrc\nPlease note, with any of the above, if I switch to root and then type source root_profile_file the aliases are loaded but only if I do indeed source the file manually.  Perhaps I've totally misunderstood how bash works and it's not possible to source a profile file automatically after switching to root but I'm hoping there is a simple solution.  Thanks in advance to anyone who's taken the time to read this message.\n\nA: Actually root uses /bin/sh (old bourne shell), .bash_profile and .bashrc are read by bash.\nIt becomes tricky as those files may use functionality not available in sh. Even if you source .bashrc or source .bash_profile, you will still have some issue with complex functions for instance.\nOne way to solve this is to run\nsudo dscl . -change /Users/root UserShell /bin/sh /bin/bash\n\nto switch root's shell to bash.\n\nA: When I absolutely must, I sudo bash which makes me root but with JRobert's environment.  My .bashrc contains:\n# Prompt: 'jrobert@JRiMac ~' in green (red, if I'm root), '$' in white\nif [[ $UID == 0 ]]; then\n   export PS1=\"\\[\\e[1;31;40m\\]\\u@\\h \\W\\[\\e[0m\\]\\$ \"\nelse\n   export PS1=\"\\[\\e[32;40m\\]\\u@\\h \\W\\[\\e[0m\\]\\$ \"\nfi\n\n, to make the root-prompt glare back at me in RED to emphasize that I'm now (more) vulnerable to my own [pick one:  brashness, dumbness, fat-finger tendencies, unwillingness to take good advice, up s.creek - don't drop the paddle].\n\nA: I am using sudo -i to switch to to root user. In this case, shell configuration is read from /var/root/.profile.\n\nA: The problem you are encountering is that when you run su by itself, you are not entering a 'login' shell. This means that your environment, working directory, and everything except uid/gid remain the same of the original user.\nLogin triggers do not execute, and you experience the issues you describe.\nA simple solution to a simple problem:\nsu -\nFrom the su(1) man page:\n\nThe su command is used to become another user during a login session. Invoked without a username, su defaults to becoming the superuser. The optional argument - may be used to provide an environment similar to what the user would expect had the user logged in directly.\n\nAlso:\n\n   -, -l, --login\n       Provide an environment similar to what the user would expect had the user logged in directly.\n\n\nIf you su into a login shell, bash will behave as you expect, and automatically source the appropriate files on \"login\", without the need for overly hacky workarounds.\n\nA: In general, I advice against su as it is dangerous, just search for it and you know why. On to your question, the root account works the same way your account does: it source ~/.bash_profile and/or ~/.bashrc. I don't know which one, but my intuition leans toward ~/.bashrc, so you might want to try to put your aliases there. Here is a suggestion:\nsu           # type password to get into root account\nvi ~/.bashrc # put your aliases there\nexit         # exit your root session\nsu           # try again to see if your aliases works\n\n\nA: if you have only one 'default' user and the root user you can put alias su=\"su -\" on .bash_profile of the 'default' user and you get the effect you want. Works and with no hacky things.\n\nA: One way to solve this is to run the following to switch root's shell to bash:\nsudo dscl . -change /Users/root UserShell /bin/sh /bin/bash\n\nThis solution has fixed my issue as well.\n", "Q: Mails from Apple are shown malformed in Outlook 2010 (Windows) I have a setup with Mac and Windows clients. The Mac users use Apple Mail and all users have an HTML signature with images. When a Mac user replies to an email the text from the initial message becomes an attachment with the name: untitled attachment001.html and the image from the signature becomes an attachment with the name: PastedGraphic.pdf.\nCan this behaviour be avoided? How can I preserve the original email and signature?\nI have managed the following. I discovered that it was due to the malformed signature. So I created a .webarchive file that contains the signature as I want to be. The signature appears correctly at both the file and the apple mail signature editor. But when I open to write a new mail only the borders of the signature image appear and there is an '?' inside the borders. What does this mean?\n\nA: The Mac users need to make sure that their outgoing email format is HTML or Rich Text even if the incoming format was plain text or use a plain text signature.\nI'd prefer the latter: I use plain text email whenever possible as it's more-widely compatible and usually is easier to read. This, by necessity, would entail using plain text signatures.\n\nA: A similar discussion is covered here and speaks of some settings i your Apple Mail Application itself:\nWhy my mails sent using Apple Mail have blank body in Outlook?\nhope this helps.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro QWERTY replacement It is a well known story about the origin of the QWERTY keyboard. For those who don't know what I am talking about: QWERTY is built on purpose to be not easy to type.\nI figured that no one stops me from rearranging my keyboard to one of the more efficient layouts.\nBefore I do that, any advice or warning?\n\nA: In 10.7 Apple provides keyboard layouts for Colemak and 4 versions of Dvorak for your typing pleasure.  You can activate them in system preferences/language & text/input sources.\nBest to go to system preferences/users and groups/login options and make sure the box is checked for \"Show Input Menu on Login Page\" if you activate additional layouts.\n\nA: I can't tell if your question is referring to the technical aspect of replacing the keys, or to general pros and cons of doing that. But one thing you might want to consider is keyboard shortcuts if you use them. Copy and Paste, Save, Select All, etc are easy to use on a QWERTY keyboard, but might not be on whatever layout you intend to switch to.\nOf course, getting used to an uncommon keyboard layout will also mean that you will have trouble writing on other people's QWERTY keyboards – only if you often interact with others and their computers though.\nAs for the process of replacing the keys: there shouldn't be any problems. People do it all the time and there are plenty of guides and video guides out there to show you how to do it.

Last time the problem solved itself via a reinstall of OS X.\nAny guesses?\n\nA: I assume you mean the key combinations traditionally used to generate extended characters like bullets, umlats, and so on.  There are several places to check.\nCheck System Preferences : Language & Text : Input Sources to make sure you are using the correct keyboard mapping (for example, \"U.S.\"):\n\nIt can be very easy to switch your keyboard layout by accident, so you may want to be sure only one layout is checked.\nIf that does not help, look in System Preferences : Keyboard : Keyboard Shortcuts and see if there are any shortcuts assigned to the combinations you are trying to use:\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to make all text fields in OS X editable with Vi keybindings?

You just have to create a file   ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict and put what you want in it. See an example.\nSince I dont use Vi, I'm not sure what the specific keybindings are, but there is a great page about Customizing the Cocoa Text System that should get you going.\n\nA: There are two option:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vi Input Manager which hasn't been updated since 2009.\n\n*KeyRemap4Macbook which I've used for a number of different options and has a Vi mode.

I'm looking at buying some extra RAM for my mid-2011 (?) MBP.  OWC says that I can handle up to 16GB (2x8), though I might elect to go with \"only\" 8GB.\nI haven't bought computer components in a couple of years, so I'm not sure what the state-of-the-art is.  Do I have to match the speed of the current modules (listed as 1333MHz) or can I go faster?  Do I have to look for certain timing characteristics?  Does brand matter?\n\nA: I believe that 1333 MHz is the max that the computer can handle. You're looking for DDR3 memory at that clock speed. Brand doesn't particularly matter. I personally like G.Skill, Crucial, Mushkin. If you're on NewEgg and sort by rating it's usually a pretty good indication of how the memory does and often times people post their computer model in their review.\n\nA: Click the apple symbol on top left > About this mac> More info > Memory . There you can see the type of memory you need. \nI don't think there are more that 1333 Mhz for laptop,even if there are they will ether not work or work at 1333(not sure which). Also unless you do really heavy work(3d modelling maybe) 8gb is more than enough. \nOn my mid 2009 MBP 13\" with 8gb memory there is no page swapping even when playing games/making movies.\nAlso about the brand. I don't think it will make any difference as long as its a well known brand like crucial kingston corsair etc.\n\nA: If you followed the OWC wizard correctly then the ram they recommend would be correct. I've ordered a lot of ram from these guys and its always been spot on for several different models. \n1333mhz is your bus speed there is no point getting faster ram, I don't even think it'd work actually. \n", "Q: Send an address in a sms to map app If a friend sends to me an address in a SMS or IMessage, for example \"I am at 123 Main St\" can I send that to the Map app to get directions there?\n\nA: The iOS will hyperlink things such as addresses, and phone numbers, in things such as emails.

We got an iPad not long ago, and I noticed that the so-called \"Mute\" switch doesn't mute the sound for all apps. I am aware of the iPhone mute switch dilemma, but what exactly does the mute switch on the iPad do? Is it like the iPhone's mute switch or is it different?\n\nA: The iPad mute switch is identical to the iPhone's mute switch except it can't control a ringer/vibration choice. Other than that, it's effect in-app will be identical.\n\n\n*\n\n*Not all apps respect the 'mute' switch. Apps that have no purpose EXCEPT to be listened to (music apps, youtube, etc.) will not be any different in either switched mode.\n\n*Frequently, games or other apps with \"ambient music\" will silence the music and often the sound effects as well when the switch is set to mute.\nIt is due to this inconsistency that I choose to set the switch to control orientation lock, and just use the volume controls as needed.\n\nA: From Apple's KB article on the iPad's side switch:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you mute your iPad, only certain sounds are muted.\n\n\n*Sounds such as alerts, notifications, sound effects, and game audio are muted.\nMedia playback (such as music, podcasts, movies, videos, and TV shows) are not muted.\n\nSo, that would explain why background music/videos aren't muted when I'm using our iPad.\n\nA: One of the main reasons why I use the mute button is to effectively turn-off the sounds made by notifications. It's handy because you don't have to manually go into Settings and mute the specific notifications for the apps, however the main drawback to using the mute button is that it mutes everything so you won't be able to hear all of the notifications when using it as opposed to manually selecting which notifications to mute in settings.\n", "Q: Windows-style taskbar functionality in OS X? Looking for an OS X add-on that will enable Windows-like (one-click) functionality for switching between different windows of a single application.\nExample: I have 5 maximized Chrome windows open, and wish to switch to a specific window. My current options are Exposé, the \"Window\" file menu, and Cmd-`. None of them are ideal because they take more than one click to execute, which is why I miss the taskbar in Windows. (For those of you unfamiliar with the taskbar, it displays a list of all your system-wide open windows similarly to how tabs are displayed in modern browsers.\nSo basically, I want to see a list of all of my open windows, and be able to toggle between them with a single click. \n\nA: Could perhaps HyperDock or DockView meet your needs?\n\nA: try uBar, which is a Windows-style taskbar for OS X (I am the developer). Just set Window Grouping to Never in the preferences, and it will display each individual window in the bar.\n\n\nA: Expose is the answer, you just need to configure it properly.\nI use a trackpad (on my desktop mac!) and have a four finger swipe to bring up expose. With a mouse you might want to investigate activating expose with a screen corner or keyboard command (eg: left hand on the keyboard, right hand on the mouse).\nProperly configured, expose is fast. It also gives you a bigger click target than the task bar.\nThere is no way to get the exact task bar functionality on OS X, you are going to have to learn a different workflow. But once you learn it, you'll be just as efficient.\n\nA: My solution to this is to not maximize windows: if I have one large window open in the middle, I'll leave ~50 pixels of open monitor on each side (less on the top) and I'll arrange ancillary windows (chat, terminal, Stickies, etc.) so various edges of them stick out beyond the edge of the big central window. Apps that have larger windows (browsers, email, etc.) that I access less-frequently I'll leave in the middle and click on the Dock icon to bring all of them forward and choose which one to use (usually, there's only one window in this sort of app in my normal usage). \nIf I have a ton of windows open in a certain app (usually BBEdit or Excel), I'll make sure none of them completely occlude another so I can, at the very least, get to any window in two clicks: one on the Dock icon and the second on an edge of the window I want; in some cases, I'll four-finger-swipe to get Exposé and then click on the document window I want.\n\nA: Using your Chrome example,\nHold CTRL and click on Chrome icon on the dock, it will bring up a list of Chrome Window that is currently opened. \n\nA: After trying MANY dock style products, at the suggestion of someone earlier in this post, I trued uBar. (I am in no way affiliated with uBar, just a new customer).\nMy particular circumstances require a working dock on multiple screens (I have 4 total, including my laptop screen). The majority of the tool bars out there just remake the Mac Dock, which is ok, but has erratic behavior when you move from one screen to another.\nuBar is the first window dock I have found that will put a dock on EVERY screen, which for me is a HUGE win. It will reduce and expand windows with a single click and change from one app to the other easily. This doc essentially mimics a Windows toolbar even down to having a quick launch area on the bottom right with the date and time. (DATE!!!) I have been a flustered Mac user for years because of companies that choose to use Mac over PC for the employees, but have been a Windows users since Windows 3.1 really.\nIf you are a Windows user crossing to Mac, this will ease your passage.\n---- update after about 3 years ----\nI tried it, and had to ditch it. The issue is that while using multiple monitors, I have found that the monitors peg the CPU. But sadly so did the UBar. I logged a few tickets and stopped using it after I burnt out a laptop.\nMy company was kind enough to replace the crispy laptop with a 32 gb version with an i7, which handles the monitors better, as long as I have a cooling pad underneath.\nBut unfortunately, even with the cooling pad, if I fired up the ubar, the fans would scream non stop and there was no way to cut down the CPU and memory usage.\nAs a result, I just got used to using the native mac capabilities. Probably the best thing I could do under the circumstances, but still curious if someone would make something better. I am going to look at a few of the new entries associated with this thread soon.\n\nA: I haven't seen anything quite what ur looking for, but Witch does a good job of rotating through all open windows whether they are minimized or not.\n\nA: iTaskbar is a product that I'm affiliated with, so be sure to check out other's reviews of it. At the moment it's the only product in this category since creating a taskbar on OS X is not as trivial as on other operating systems. ;)\n\nWe hope it will be helpful to all those people who, just like us, need a taskbar to work efficiently.\n\nA: And don't forget that holding down option when clicking between different application windows (or to the Desktop) will hide the app you're clicking out of.  If you're a OOTMOOTK (one on the mouse, one on the keyboard) type user, it makes a world of difference.\n\nA: I do not have a mouse so cannot test using one.\nWith a Trackpad \nYou can use a gesture to swipe the \"Application's Exxposé\"\nThe \"Application's Exposé\" shows you thumbnails and scaled windows of the current Application.\n\nOr if you hover over any app in the dock which has open windows (does not have to be the currently active) and use the gesture \"Application's Exposé\" will show you the windows for that app.\nYou can then click into one of them or gesture back to your current app.\nSetup the gesture in the Trackpad preference pane in System Preferences\n\nUsing the keyboard \nYou can do the same by setting a hot key to replace the gesture part. But it will only show the current apps windows.\nThis is set under the Application Windows in Mission Control preference pane in System Preferences.\n\n\nA: You might also want to check out Contexts: https://contexts.co.  It seems to do a better job of finding all the windows than other things I've tried in the past.\n", "Q: Resynch latest workouts I just plugged in my iPod Nano to upload my last few workouts to Nike. When iTunes started it said there was a new version that I agreed to upgrade to, and part of the upgrade required quitting iTunes. Now my last 4 workouts are not uploaded to Nike+. Is it possible to get those workouts uploaded, or are they lost forever?\n\nA: I ended up contacting Nike and they were able to add the basic details to their site. It didn't have all the details, but the overall time and distance were added. I would guess that there isn't a way to resend a workout if it doesn't upload right.\n", "Q: Lion login screen I have a lot of users in my household (6 total + guest).  Is there a way to wrap or stack the user icons rather than having them scroll off the right part of the screen?\n\nA: Currently there is no way of changing the users list formatting.\nThe solution I use on our main computer is to simply disable the login icons and let users type their username/password.\nTo do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to \"System Preferences\" \n\n*select \"Users & Groups\" \n\n*There chose login options \n\n*for the \"Display Login Window as\" option select \"Name and Password\" \n", "Q: Is Private Browsing broken in Safari 5.1.4? From the release notes for Safari 5.1.4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow cookies set during regular browsing to be available after using Private Browsing\n\n\nWhat?\nDoesn't that mean, to give an example, that if I go to Amazon in Private Browsing mode, Amazon will still know who I am, and all the things that I look at will appear as \"recently visited\" when I go to Amazon later (even on a completely different computer)?\nIf so, what good is Private Browsing mode?\nAm I missing something here?\n\nNote that secretly buying gifts as a surprise for loved ones is the \"official\" example often given for why one would want Private Browsing. Of course, If I actually buy them, I will have to tell Amazon about it, and it will enter my profile, but all the browsing before that could be hidden.\n\nA: There was a bug that prevented cookies set begore going into safe mode from working again after the safe period had ended. \nImagine a truck with four wheel drive and when you were done and switched back to two wheel mode. It would be a problem if the indicators said two wheel but four was still engaged.\nThis text you quoted indicates the getting out of safe mode was tweaked so more things work again post safe mode. \n\nA: Yes and no; it's working as designed, which is not the way people typically expect it would work.  \nMost people think such browser features will make it impossible for users of the same computer to figure out which sites the browser has been used to visit, and make it impossible for sites to know whether or not a particular user has previously visited them.  Researchers find they don't do that.  They're usually good at the former and usually bad at the latter.  This is all Apple promises when Private Browsing is Enabled : \"Safari will keep your browsing history private for all tabs in this window. Safari won’t remember the pages you visit, your search history, or your Autofill information\"\nSee also: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2619068?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Monitor Words Per Minute on the background? I'm looking for an application that can run on the background and would monitor my average words per minute as I go about my day. At the end of the day (or week) I want to see a recap of my performance and the features that I am expecting it to have are:\n\n\n*\n\n*My WPM\n\n*Total number of words I typed.\n\n\nIs there an app that does something like this? The idea came to me awhile ago when I saw a vanity USB gadget that you can plug in to your laptop and will monitor your average WPM count.\n\nA: This is a tricky one to solve and get meaningful data.\nFirstly, what defines a \"word\"?  Usually in a text editing program this would be defined as a series of alphanumeric characters separated by a space or a new line character.  That gets pretty tricky in an OS that uses those 2 keys for other options like QuickView, and enter in save dialogues and the like.\nMany apps simply do not input text in a way that would make a words per minute  count useful, for example safari.  Would typing URLs of filling in forms provide any meaningful data, or would it just trash the more useful bits of your statistics etc.\nYou may be better served looking for a writing app that does this (such as this one for example - others exist) and is able to understand when it is actively being used, and when it is minimised etc, so that you are only capturing the info when you are actually doing something worth of monitoring.\nTo help in this there is a great tool called QuickCursor that will allow you to switch any text input field to the text editor of your choice.  That way once you have found a program that you like for typing in that offers a WPM count feature, you can then use that program for all your typing by switching to it with a keyboard shortcut from any place where you need to type, including email/web forms etc, and then switching back and taking the contents with you.\nHaving said all the above, there is an app called TypingStats that will just sit on your menu bar and take systemwide statistics, on the proviso that it only actually guesses at your WPM by counting every 5th keystroke as a \"word\" and then doing the maths to give you an approximation.\n\n", "Q: \"Home screen pinch\" in iPhone 4? In iPad there's a nice \"Home screen pinch\" gesture where pinching with four or more fingers acts as the home screen button.\nThis could be useful for me on my iPhone 4 as well, since the home screen button sometimes does not react well. I am aware that for jailbroken phones it is possible (and easy to use). Is it also possible on non-jailbroken phones? (Just upgraded to 5.1).\n\nA: No. This multitouch gesture (as well as a few others) are iPad only. The gestures existed for iPhones and iPods in the iOS 4.3 Beta, but were removed before the public release. iOS 5.0 re-introduced the gestures for iPad.\n", "Q: What's the name of the iOS / OS X calculator app that has 'variables' functionality? I'm looking for an app on the App Store but I forgot its name.\nIt is a calculator app that looks like it has been written on a noteblock.\nYou can store the solutions of calculations as quasi-variables and then reuse them later on.\nI know it's available for the Mac and all iOS devices.\nDoes anyone know what app this is?\n\nA: This sounds like the app Soulver which is available on Mac OS X and iOS.  It allows you to use a mixture of natural language and spreadsheet/calculator functions to perform easily readable equations.\n\n\nA: This sounds like it could be Numi, which describes itself as follows:\n\nNumi is a little calculator, that lives in your menu bar. It magically\n  combines calculations with text, and allows you to share computations\n  with other Numi users.\n\n\nA: Try this one as well http://www.swiftcalc-mac.com It has variables and can calculate many expressions at once\n", "Q: Emptying the Trash: not working On Lion 10.7.3, when trying to empty the Trash from the GUI the items to be deleted are counted, and the the dialog doesn't progress anymore:\n\nStopping emptying the Trash doesn't help much either: the only thing changing is the status on the dialog that now reads Stopping...\nIt's reported that resetting the PRAM does the trick, and I know that I can just force the removal from the CLI, but can somebody help me understand why this is happening and how to fix it?\n\nA: You could also try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal from /Applications/Utilities\n\n*Run command: rm -rfv ~/.Trash/*\nThis should delete all files in the trash and show you what it's doing as it goes.\n\nA: A program that is accessing files in the Trash that you're trying to Empty could interfere with attempt to Empty Trash.\nThe resulting timeout causes the \"Stopping…\" (which takes forever) alert message that you saw. \nYou can turn off Time Machine and try again or perhaps reboot (after turning off Time Machine) and see if the trash empties properly before starting up Time Machine or whatever other programs might have files open.\n", "Q: How can I generate iOS/Flurry style icons in OS X? As some of you might know, the iOS treatment of app icons is ruthlessly strict. It forces a certain roundness of the corners and allows no transparency, hence enforcing a unified look. I think that's nice.\nI recently fell in love with Iconfactory's Flurry icon set and making new icons in that style made me think; what's the easiest way of applying a mask and an overlay on a custom image, and generate all sizes needed for a complete OS X icon file (icns)?\nAs mentioned below I'm not looking for technical explainations of how iOS generates its icons, nor a system wide solution for generating icons on the fly. Just what's mentioned in bold above. I'm also aware of the IconBuilder approach and although it's a great tool, it's not what I'm asking for. I'd prefer a drag-and-drop interface of some sort.\n\nA: Perhaps if someone wrote a hack (but I remain skeptical as all this could be easily done by getting the icon's template (PSD file) and doing it manually.\niOS has a framework in place to deal with SpringBoard icons. The files are as follows (naming convention taken from iOS 5. Previous iOS versions drop the ~iphone suffix):\n\n\n*\n\n*AppIconMask@2x~iphone.png\n\n*AppIconOverlay@2x~iphone.png\n\n*AppIconShadow@2x~iphone.png\n\n\n(1) is the clipping mask, that dictates the shape of the icon. (2) is the \"gloss\" effect that has somewhat fallen out of favor in the past couple of years and is optional. (3) is the base of the icon, the shadow that is applied under the final product.\nI made a graphic and accompanying explanation of how they all work together on my website which should help better explain how iOS delivers icons on its respective device.\n\nOS X has no such system in place. Each icon is simply constrained by the dimensions set in Finder. Apple never sought to control the way icons look on OS X, but wanted to have a uniform appearance on iOS (and I don't blame them), hence the reason why they developed such a framework.\nYou could try contacting a Cocoa developer on porting the MobileIcons.framework from iOS to OS X, but again, because Finder can adjust sizes (in Lion, anywhere from 1024x1024 on down), I remain skeptical that it at all possible.\n\nA: The other apps mentioned have their uses, but for your stated request, there are 2 apps that accomplish it very easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*icons\n\n*iDeveloper - Icon Generator\nBoth are available on the Mac App Store, but I prefer icons between the two—it's vastly more robust, and quite polished.  As you'll see from the screen-cap I added, icons makes tinkering with all the variables (corners, shine, export sizes, etc.) very easy—and that's only one part of the app!  (The other tabs address non-iDevice icons…)\n\n\nA: Building off of cksum's answer, if you can get ahold of the mask, overlay and shadow images at high enough resolution (@2x images are still only about 140px square,) and you're comfortable with the command line/shell scripting, you can use ImageMagick, a nice command line image processor, to actually mask and compose the icon.\nOnce you've installed ImageMagick (They have installation instructions here) you should be able to process your image with the mask, overlay and shadow:\nconvert YourImage.png overlay.png -composite YourImage_overlay.png\nconvert YourImage_overlay.png mask.png -alpha off -compose CopyOpacity -composite YourImage2.png\nconvert shadow.png YourImage2.png -composite YourImage_largest.png\nconvert YourImage_largest.png -geometry 512 Icon512.png\nconvert YourImage_largest.png -geometry 256 Icon256.png\n\nThis assumes that Your_Image is large and square (1024x1024) and that the mask.png, overlay.png and shadow.png are the same size.\nIdeally, you wouldn't just resample the largest icon down to get the smaller versions, but you could instead use normal icon making software (e.g. IconBuilder) and use it to make YourImage at each size, then do the above to each one individually.\nAs for getting the mask, overlay and shadow images to the correct size, my best recommendation would be to enlarge them and then build them back (i.e. drawing a new roundrect and gradients) at full resolution with Photoshop or GIMP.\nOnce you have the image at each resolution, you can throw it into Apples own Icon Composer (in the iOS/Mac SDK) to create the .icns\nIt's not the easiest solution, but it provides you the flexibility of specifying the exact mask and other effects and of the command line.\n\nA: First, check out Img2Icns for the easiest way to make an ICNS file from a 512x512 image file.  (The free version works great).\nSecond, check out CandyBar to manage and install replacement icons.  Costs a few dollars, but it's a great program.\nThird, search DeviantArt for Flurry icons that have already been created.  Search for both flurry icon and ios icon.\nFinally, if you can't find what you're looking for, use this Flurry template to create new icons.  \n\nA: There is no need to create the corners and shine, they are added automatically by your app at compile time.\nFrom the docs1:\n\nWhen iOS displays your application icon on the Home screen of a device, it automatically adds the following visual effects:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Rounded corners \n  \n*Drop shadow\n  \n*Reflective shine (unless you prevent the shine effect)\n  \n\n", "Q: How do I reclaim the \"other\" space on my iPad? I have 3.3 gigs of space in the \"other\" category on my 16 gig iPad. The space for \"other\" has grown over time. \nI've synced. I've powered down. I've turned all running apps off. \nHow do I reclaim this used space that I'm not using?\n\nA: I had the same issue - 2 GB \"other\" space that I couldn't attribute to anything. After seeing Martin's thought I decided to try installing the iOS 6 update, even though I didn't want to. That did the trick, cleared up 1.8 GB.\nIdeally Apple would provide an easier way to reclaim \"other\" space.\n\nA: This problem was driving me crazy. I tried everything suggested on numerous websites and forums, until I finally realized what had happened. I installed the programs sugested by many and searched for this other space that was referenced. I couldn't find much, and it was really frustrating. I finally just rebooted it and cleared all the space, so... if you haven't tried rebooting your iPad/iPhone do that.\n\nA: The \"Other\" space is not necessarily unused as you imply.  It could simply be your user data from your applications.\nIf you check in Settings > General > Usage you can gauge how much space your apps are using up including their data (might be photos, or podcasts, or pictures, or anything).\nFor example, my Instacast it taking up 406Mb of space, but the application is only 3.3Mb.  So that's over 400Mb of \"other\" space taken up right there:\n \nIf you were to add up your the data in this list, then subtract the total amount of \"application\" usage from it, it should pretty much equate to the bulk of this \"other\" data.  Of course, there are other things that are included as \"Other\", including your mail data, sms messages, internal log files and location data stores etc etc etc which may fluctuate over time but the big portion is just your apps contents.\n\nA: I've just been through the process of finding out what is included in \"Other\" and clearing it on my iPod Touch (4th Gen, iOS 5), so I believe the following should apply to the iPad as well. \nI had 2.3GB in the Other section as reported by the iTunes bar. This does not include the data within the apps, they are shown as the App section of the iTunes bar and itemised as shown in stuffe's post. The majority of it (2.2GB) was pictures and video taken using the camera, still in the Photos app in Camera Roll. I found that out using DiskAid, which allows you to copy them to your PC/Mac. Right click and Get Info on folders in DiskAid shows you how big each one is. Note that the Photos section of the iTunes bar seems to include the other albums but not the Camera Roll.\nI tried this answer, removing the F folders, but it didn't save that much memory for me (about 0.1GB), you may get better results.\nA lot of people seem to be saying it's the Mail app, log files, bookmarks, notes, calendar appointments, reminders etc but this doesn't seem to add up to gigabytes.\nAnother thought - it appears that iOS 6 has downloaded without my permission, which would be a rather large file. As soon as the badge on Settings appeared, I noticed that it gave me the option to download and install. Until the Maps issue is resolved, I don't intend to upgrade, so I definitely haven't given it permission, but now it simply says Install Now. \n\nA: Shut down the ipad completely, restart it sync and you get the free space. Strange but it works. I had 25gb in my other\n\nA: I tried to change the movies on my ipad 2, deleting 3 and adding a new 3 at the same time. The sizes were ok so it should have been able to fit easily. The delete happened but I did not get the space recovered. My Other category swelled.\nRe-syncing failed then I found powering off then on solved my problem, \"other\" went to a normal amount and then I was able to add my movies, I think this is rediculous but it just adds to the \"others\" mystery.\n\nA: I used DiskAid, went to Media - PhotoData - Thumbnails and deleted everything in the folder. I reclaimed 1.76GB or 3.53GB.\n\nA: This happens to me every three or four syncs.  \"Other\" mushrooms to 3-4 gigs.  The solution I use is to disconnect the iPad from the PC.  Hard power down.  Wait 10 or more seconds.  Repower up the iPad and then sync.  It works about 95% of the time.\n", "Q: Restart Screen Sharing Service on Mac mini Server I'm running Mac OS X (think it's Snow Leopard - 10.6.7) on a Mac mini. I'm trying to connect remotely from an iMac (this has been working fine in the past, for some time). When I click \"Share Screen...\" in finder on the iMac, I (eventually) see the server's desktop, but it appears to be frozen. However, I've managed to determine (from closing the window and sharing screen again, on repeat) that it IS actually receiving input, just not updating the display.\nI can ssh into the server, but how can I restart the screen sharing service?\n\nA: I had the same trouble, and to a headless Mini also. This is what I found that worked…\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist  \nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\n\nI had the opportunity to install an SSD in my Mini, and did a clean install of Lion at that time, and the issue persisted.\nI made an alias\nalias fixscreen='sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist &&  sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist'\n\n\nA: OK, managed to find the answer (or, at least, an answer; I'm not quite sure on all the details of this command):\n$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -users admin -privs -all -restart -agent -menu\n\nAs always - be careful when you paste something into terminal - best to inspect the command before running it. Doubly so when sudo is involved.\n\nA: Using launchctl unload and launchctl load still works but the commands are now \"legacy commands\".\nHere's a more recent approach that also works with a single command:\nsudo launchctl kill KILL system/com.apple.screensharing\n\nThis instructs launchctl to kill the screensharing service and then launchctl automatically restarts it after it has exited.\n\nA: Rather than restart just the screen sharing service, I would suggest remote restarting the Mac Mini. You can do this via SSH by typing in:\nsudo shutdown -r now\nThis will not only restart the screen sharing service, but may also resolve the issue that caused it to act up in the first place.\n", "Q: Can I copy SD cards using an iPod touch? I'd like to backup photos taken on my dSLR camera on SD cards. Can I use a USB adapter to copy an SD card into the iPod's local memory, then attach a different SD card and copy the files to that?\n\nA: Probably not, as the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit is officially not supported on iPhone or iPod touch; and that would just give you the physical connection of your SD card to the iPod touch. \nTo have direct access to the file-system of your SD-card you need a jailbreak.\nThere is a slight chance you may get the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit working on a jailbroken iPod touch:\nCheck out iConnectionKit and this YouTube video.\n\nCamera Connection Kit on iPhone / iPod Touch (upcoming JB tweak)\nPROJECT STATUS = ALPHA\nTop 5 contributors will be granted early beta access on 2nd of April 2012.\nSUPPORTED DEVICES - iOS 5.0.1\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*iPod Touch 4G - [Tested & Working] - Watch the demonstration videos.\n  \n*iPod Touch 3G - [Possible] Contribute any amount to help us afford the device and enable the Camera Connection Kit\n  \n*iPhone 3GS - [Possible] Contribute any amount to help us afford the device and enable the Camera Connection Kit\n  \n*iPhone 4S - [Possible] Contribute any amount to help us afford the device and enable the Camera Connection Kit\n  \n*iPhone 4 - [Possible] Contribute any amount to help us afford the device and enable the Camera Connection Kit\n  \n  \n  JB required.\n\n\nA: I bought a \"hitch\" a while back & this lets you transfer data from one usb device to another without anything else needed.

Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Why there is no standard way to uninstall programs in MacOS? Is not it ridiculous that every time you want to uninstall a program you have to google for some magical tricks \"Delete files A,B,C in you /Library, run a .sh script from console, etc\". Why Microsoft managed to create a simple and effective way for uninstallation via Control Panel and Apple did not ?\n\nA: The standard way, assuming the program is following all of the App guidelines Apple lays out, is to drag the .app bundle from the installation location (usually /Applications) to the Trash.\nThere are some exceptions to this, but for the most part that's how you do it.\nThe program files that get left behind in ~/Library/Application Support can also be cleaned up if you wish, but they're generally considered benign and can be ignored.\nThere are uninstall helpers that make the removal of an application and all its support files much easier. So you don't have to Google for details on how to remove things. Take a look at TrashMe or AppCleaner -- both of these tools attempt to automate the search and removal of support files that go along with applications. In the case of TrashMe, it also helps you uninstall widgets and System Configuration plugins, which is handy. I personally prefer TrashMe.\nSome software integrates so deeply (MacFuSE or Growl for example) in to the system that the only way to uninstall it via a script. In these cases there is usually an uninstall script in the .dmg file that you downloaded to install the software or one provided by the developer on their website.\n\nA: There is no default \"uninstaller\" largely for the same reason that there is no default \"installer\".\nMost programs are installed simply by moving them to the location from which you want them to run, which is most often your applications folder, but there no reason why (and I see this a LOT) you cannot simply run the program from your downloads folder without ever moving them - this is very common where the .app file is downloaded directly without being inside a .dmg disk image file which then often prompts you to drag the icon to your applications folder.\nAs Ian C's answer, such apps may leave traces of themselves in library folders etc when they are run, but theses are not considered to be particularly important and safe to leave, and often it's beneficial (either to the user or to the vendor) as it allows for such things as re-installing and finding all your old settings are back as normal, or not allowing re-installing as it finds an old expired trial license etc.  The efficacy of this sort of thing is of varying importance depending who you ask.\nYou do sometimes get programs which use a specific installer, these are often doing things that require more complex procedures to allow them to work, such as installing a kernel module etc, and typically if it comes with an installer, there should be an uninstaller with it, but these install mechanisms often differ from app to app and your results may vary.\n", "Q: Adjusting brightness on 27\" iMac used as external DisplayPort monitor for PC I have a Windows7 64-bit machine attached to a 27\" iMac as an external displayport monitor It's working well, except I cannot adjust the brightness.\nI have attached a Mac keyboard both on the Mac & Windows side to gain access to the brightness controls, with no luck. As soon as I switch to display target mode, the screen jumps to full brightness, and cannot be controlled from the keyboard on either platform.\nI have searched the web but have not found the answer:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924\nhttp://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/using-target-display-mode.htm\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/60145/how-do-i-use-a-new-27-imac-as-an-external-pc-monitor-with-full-2560x1440-resolu\n\nA: I just had an issue with not being able to change the brightness on my 27inch iMac in Target Display Mode. It was at full brightness. And the brightness keys on the keyboard hooked up to the TDM Mac would not adjust it. But I found if I pressed and held Commond-F1 on that keyboard it slowly lowered the brightness. This probably won't help much if you have an issue with it defaulting to a low brightness though.\niMac 2009 High Sierra and iMac Pro Mojave.\n\nA: I had the problem of brightness stuck on maximum when using a 27\" late 2009 iMac (running High Sierra macOS 10.13.6) as an extra screen (in target display mode) using a MacBook Pro 15in (2018) running macOS Catalina 10.15.3. The iMac had an Apple wireless keyboard connected, and the macBook Pro was connected to the iMac via a USB-C to mini displayport cable (i.e. in target display mode). The display on the iMac toggled from the iMac in the normal mode to being an extra display for the macBook using command-F2 on the wireless keyboard. I found that the brightness control keys on the wireless keyboard (F1 and F2) for the iMac in target display mode only worked when I was logged into an account on the iMac. If the iMac was restarted, and nobody was logged into it, the brightness keys on the wireless keyboard did nothing.  So when you start the iMac you need to log in to it before putting it into target display mode.\n\nA: One poster in this Apple discussion forum had a suggestion:\n\nI've futzed with this for a while using a MBP and an iMac, both\n  running 10.6.8. The problem is inconsistent for me, but seems to be\n  linked to how long I've had the iMac on.  If on chronically (as I\n  usually leave it), the iMac tends not to respond to F1/F2 brightness\n  keystrokes when I connect my MBP and use the iMac in target display\n  mode. But if I reboot the iMac and then connect from my already\n  running MBP, this restores brightness keystroke response. That is:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*With MBP and iMac running, connect mini DP to start target display mode on iMac\n  \n*If brightness keystrokes don't respond, disconnect mini DP and reboot iMac, leave MBP running\n  \n*After booted to desktop on the iMac, reconnect mini DP - brightness keys should respond\n  \n\nI don't have your setup, so I can't verify that this solution works. However, it's worth a shot.\n\nA: It is probably easier to adjust the brightness in windows from the display drivers settings. usually you can right click empty desktop and the display drivers UI is the first entry in context menu (like \"AMD Vision Control Center\"). All three major video card vendors can adjust brightness on the drivers side.\n\nA: It is confirmed that should be able to control that with iMac's keyboard. I've tried but it doesn't work in your setup.\nAlso, the brightness doesn't show up under OS X's System Preferences, and I have no chance to test it under Windows since my Thunderbolt Macs will only connect under OS X, not under Windows 8 Boot Camp.\nI will try DDC/CI software though it have a high chance of not working.\nYour last option, though bad, is to adjust it with software like how you adjust it in game.\n\nA: I'm running a late 2009 i7 27\" iMac in Target Display mode connected to a 2018 MBP. I could not control the brightness on the iMac display using the keyboard running to the MacBook Pro, BUT, by connecting a second keyboard directly to the iMac, I found that the brightness controls on that second keyboard DID allow me to adjust the brightness. Hope that helps....\n\nA: There's lots of good software programs listed under this question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20237/can-i-change-the-brightness-on-a-secondary-display\nBut for a no-install solution, I've used the new \"night shift\" feature to dim things.  Works if you just need to take the edge off on the brightness.  In System Preferences > Displays > Night Shift you can adjust the Color Temperature slider to change how much effect it has.\n\nA: I was having this problem, too.  What I found is that when mirroring the displays the external keyboard adjusts brightness on both computers. When NOT mirroring the displays the keyboard on the primary Mac (in my case a Macbook Pro) adjusts the it's own display and the external keyboard connected to the MacBook Pro adjusts the iMac display.\nI am running Sierra (10.12.6) on a 2012 27\" iMac and El Capitan (10.11.6) on a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I wound up using:\nBrightness Slider, free in the Mac App store.\n\nA: Hoping this will help someone..\nI was having the same issue. Brightness control keys on the keyboard connected to the iMac would sometimes work and sometimes would not. I was thinking this is a bug and the whole Target Display Mode is just glitchy, but I just found out that for brightness controls to work the iMac cannot be locked before you go into TD mode. I tested this and works as expected.\nI still think this is a bug as volume control keys still work regardless of the iMac being locked or not. Don't see why brightness shouldn't be the same.\nProblem is when you go into TD mode with iMac unlocked, and your other mac sleeps, when the iMac also goes into sleep/locked state after a while you get the issue again. When that happens you need to disconnect, unlock, and connect again!\n\nA: I resolved this by unticking auto-brightness on the iMac before connecting via thunderbolt! Hope this helps\n\n", "Q: Combining Finder's File Open/save dialog with Alfred Finder's Open/Save File dialog is actually very dumb (in terms of flexibility). When I look for a file or its location, I can probably find it much faster using Alfred.\nHowever, in many cases, you just have to use that dialog. Not particularly when you open files, but for example when you specify the place to save them.\n\nAs I'm a keyboard-only user (at least for 99% of the time), I find it tedious to launch Alfred, and reveal the file/directory in Finder and drag it (or its proxy icon) to the dialog in order to open/save it.\nIs there any way I can get a keyboard-only, fuzzy-matching style file/folder selection mechanism for this dialog?\nI could imagine using Alfred and AppleScript for that, but I don't know where to start. The end result would be that I could just select the appropriate file or folder via Alfred. \nNote that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have the Alfred Powerpack, so AppleScript is possible.\n\n*I know Alfred has an \"Open with…\" action. This is not the same.\n\n*I know I can go to folders with ⌘⇧G, but it's weak in comparison to what a real shell offers.\n\n*I know you can Spotlight-search in that dialog, but I prefer Alfred's capabilities.\n\n\nUpdate, 5 years later: I came looking for a solution for this and stumbled upon my own question. I also found this thread in which people have suggested several workflows, but the only one that would actually directly work is now a dead link (don't you just love it when text-only stuff is hosted on someone's Dropbox?).\n\nA: Once you find the file using Alfred, you can copy its path to the clipboard and paste that path into the Go to Folder tool of open/save dialogs.\nFind your file in Alfred, press the right arrow key to view the list of operations for that file, the up arrow key to go to the last option (Copy path to clipboard), and then the enter key to activate that option.\nSwitch back to the open/save dialog, press cmd-shift-g to  open the Go to Folder dialog, paste the path in, and hit enter. The file will be selected and you can hit Enter to open/save.\n\nIf you're interested in getting some more flexibility out of Open/Save dialogs, I highly recommend Default Folder X. It's immensely powerful and customizable and could eliminate the need for workarounds like this.\n$35, 30 day trial\n\nA: Five years later, I found a solution using an older AppleScript that was posted here, which wasn't working anymore because the Go to… window uses a ComboBox instead of a TextField.\nHere's how to use that in Alfred:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new workflow\n\n*Insert a File Action\n\n*Insert a Run NSAppleScript action and connect the two\n\n*Paste the script below\n\n*Save the workflow and give it a proper name and bundle identifier\n\n\nTo use it in practice, wait for a file selection dialog to open, then launch Alfred, select the file/folder you want, and run the action you  just created.\nHere's the script:\non alfred_script(q)\nset filePath to POSIX path of q as text\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set theApplication to application processes whose frontmost is true\n    set target to item 1 of theApplication\n    set target to a reference to front window of target\n    set target to a reference to front sheet of target\n    delay 0.5\n    tell target to keystroke \"g\" using {command down, shift down} -- Activate goto field\n    delay 0.5\n    tell target\n        set value of combo box 1 to filePath\n        delay 0.5\n        key code 36 -- simulate pressing the Enter key\n    end tell\nend tell\nend alfred_script\n\n", "Q: Built-In Trackpad and Keyboard Unresponsive after Sleep or Restart I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2008) that's currently running 10.7.3.

Does anyone know of a way to enable Apple Mail like signature customization in iOS? \nMy iPhone is jailbroken, so if you have a jailbreak solution that works I'm good with that.\n\nA: There's a JailBreak Tweak called Mail Enhancer that does exactly what you want. It's $4.99 in the BigBoss repository, and there's another one called SIGnify for $1.50 in the ModMyi repo. They both allow you to have signatures with HTML formatting, but the more expensive one has many more features that make the Mail.app much more usable.\n\nA: Here's an interesting workaround for getting rich-text signatures to cooperate in iOS' mail.app (without jailbreaking):\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the rich text you want to use for your signature\n\n*Paste into empty signature field for account within Mail settings\n\n*Shake to Undo and you should see \"Undo Change Attributes\" prompt\n\n*Pasted text should now appear formatted as it was originally copied\n\n\nThis works well in my testing within iOS7, however inline images still are not supported (they show within the signature field in settings but end up as attachments when emailed)\n/via http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1522622\n", "Q: Cannot reinstall iPhoto from App Store in Lion My company recently upgraded my laptop to OS X Lion and was pre-installed with iPhoto purchased under a different Apple ID.

If a list doesn't exist, does Internet Sharing log DHCP requests and if so, where? Thanks.\n\nA: You can try arp on the command-line:\n\nNAME\narp -- address resolution display and control\nDESCRIPTION\nThe arp utility displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address translation tables used by the address resolution protocol (arp(4)).  With no flags, the program displays the current ARP entry for hostname.  The host may be specified by name or by number, using Internet dot notation.\n\nE.g. for internet-sharing from Ethernet to Airport I use:\narp -i en1 -a\nThis will list all clients connected via WLAN.\n\nA: InternetSharing does log which address gets a DHCP lease within:\n/var/log/system.log\n\nTechnically it is the bootpd daemon which does take care of this part of the network access.\nYou can track who is getting access to your network now with this command:\ntail -f /var/log/system.log | grep 'bootpd.*\\[en.\\]'\n\nand for Mavericks, Yosemite & El Capitan:\ntail -f /var/log/system.log | grep 'bootpd.*\\[bridge.\\]'\n\nYou can display who connected and when to your network with this command:\ngrep 'bootpd.*\\[en.\\]' /var/log/system.log\n\nand for Mavericks, Yosemite & El Capitan:\ngrep 'bootpd.*\\[bridge.\\]' /var/log/system.log\n\nIf you need to track it further in the past, the command is:\nbzgrep 'bootpd.*\\[en.\\]' `ls -tr /var/log/system.log.*.bz2`\n\nand for Mavericks, Yosemite & El Capitan:\nbzgrep 'bootpd.*\\[bridge.\\]' `ls -tr /var/log/system.log.*.bz2`\n\nFinally if you'd like to immediately distinguish in these logfiles\nknown devices from uninvited ones, the method is to fill the configuration file of\nbootpd which is:\n/etc/bootptab\n\nwith all known MAC addresses.\n\nA: In Big Sur (and probably for a few versions prior), there no longer appears to be any log entry written to /var/log/system.log by default, at least for lease renewals.\nThe arp method in this answer is still useful, but is a round-about way to get there given that it includes all hosts that have been contacted recently. That can result in showing either additional hosts (ie. those not associated with an Internet Sharing lease), or not all hosts (if they haven't been sent a packet recently), depending on recent activity.\nA more direct method is to check the leases database at /var/db/dhcpd_leases. That will show all current leases, however that includes hosts that still have a current lease but are not currently connected. To also check for an active connection, you can pass the ip address associated with the lease to something like ping or nmap.\nAs described in this answer, a one-line using nmap could be:\ngrep ip_address /private/var/db/dhcpd_leases | cut -d= -f2 | nmap -iL - -sn\nIf you don't want to use nmap, you can do something similar with ping:\ngrep ip_address /private/var/db/dhcpd_leases | cut -d= -f2 | xargs -L1 ping -c 1\nThat will send one ping to every ip address for which there is a DHCP lease.\n\nA: use ndp for ipv6 and arp for ipv4 in the terminal\nndp -a\narp -a\nsee the manual pages for details and options, I'm new to these and was trying to figure out the same question which seems spread over several answers in parts, over a long span of time (ipv4 not inclusive of ipv6) note too you can ping the ipv4 broadcast address directly to see who responds, I don't yet know if a rough equivalent is possible with ipv6 using ping6 or even relevant. also see https://superuser.com/questions/969831/why-is-arp-replaced-by-ndp-in-ipv6 and possibly also https://serverfault.com/questions/648140/how-to-scan-ipv6-enabled-hosts-on-my-lan and https://superuser.com/questions/495026/ipv6-find-all-hosts-in-a-prefix\n", "Q: How do I turn FTP sharing on in Lion? I recently upgraded to Lion and I tried to FTP into it from another Mac, but I couldn't. I went to System Preferences>Sharing and could only find AFP and SMB sharing. How do I enable FTP sharing in Lion?\n\nA: The option has been removed from the GUI in OS X 10.7 however you can enable it with a few commands. \nHere is a good write up on how to do it. \nhttp://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20088844-263/managing-ftp-services-in-os-x-lion/\nSummary of the link above: \nTo Load: \nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\n\nThen to start and stop you would run the following: \nsudo launchctl start com.apple.ftpd\n\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.ftpd\n\nTo Unload: \nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\n\n\nA: If I am not mistaken FTP is not supported anymore, too insecure, eg sends your password in the clear over the network etc. However, if you enable \"Remote Login\" in sharing, you can use SFTP which works just as well as FTP. SFTP stands for secure FTP and therefore all the information you transfer between computers is encrypted while in transit over the network, internet, etc.\n\nOnce you enable it on your computer you can connect to it using SSH / SFTP log in formats for example see below:\nsftp username@hostname_or_ip-address\n\n", "Q: Running a linux Multiseat configuration on Mac Mini hardware Does Mac mini hardware support multiseat configurations? I don't think os x supports it, but assuming I used ubuntu or fedora, are their any hardware limitations?\n\nA: You can do something similar to Linux multiseat configurations with Lion Screen Sharing. If you have multiple user accounts on your Lion machine, you can turn on Screen Sharing in System Preferences>Sharing:\n\nThen, in the sidebar of your Finder window, you can click on the name of your computer, and click \"Share Screen\". Enter the user id and password for the account you want to log into. If you screen share with a Mac that already has a user logged in, you have the choice use a virtual display, which will allow you to log in to a separate user account.\n", "Q: How to lock the size of the Dock? My dock is positioned on the right. As I launch/quit/minimize applications, the width of the dock is always changing. This behavior either makes the dock overlap my maximized windows (maximized via Divvy), or it leaves a gap between right side of a window and the dock.\nIs there a way to lock the size of the Dock so that it doesn't change regardless of the number of icons on it?\n\nA: In a word, \"No\".\nThe dock is dynamically sized as you have found on the basis of the number of applications stored, or running, and the amount of document windows you may have minimised.\nThere is no way to stop it exhibiting this behaviour, and if you think about it it would cause considerable usability issues if it were to do so, as the only way to maintain a static width would be dynamic resizing of App/Document icons, which would eventually be too small to usefully identify.\nIf you don't like the overlap, then you can try a couple of workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the dock to autohide\n\n*Open what you consider to be the maximum\nnumber of items in your dock, and scale the size down in preferences\nto make it fit in your \"gap\", then accept that a lot of the time it\nwill be smaller, even it it shouldn't get much bigger than the gap.\n\n*Use a vertical dock to any change of size shouldn'f affect the width.\n\n\nA: If you want to lock the dock so that you can't resize it, run this command in a terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock size-immutable -bool yes && killall Dock\nIf you want to unlock the dock so that you can resize it, run this command in a terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock size-immutable -bool no && killall Dock\nSource\n\nA: I would recommend setting your dock to minimise program window to their app icon. To do this go into your docks settings and click the option that states \"minimise to dock icon\" \nThis should prevent the dock from growing better or smaller. However the more programs you run the dock will increase in size. I suggest pinning the programs to the dock that you use most often and then resize your windows.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use AT&T 3G on a Verizon LTE iPad? According to the new iPad tech specs page, in addition to their separate LTE bands, both the Verizon and AT&T models ship with:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz);\n  \n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n  \n\nSo it's clear that the Verizon LTE iPad has the radios and the bands to use AT&T's 3G network. It even has a micro-SIM tray. Would it be possible to get an AT&T micro-SIM and use AT&T 3G on a Verizon LTE iPad?\nFor me, this would be the best of both worlds. I don't live in an area with LTE yet, but given the rollout pace from Verizon and AT&T it's very likely that Verizon will get to my area long before AT&T will. However, currently, I get pretty good AT&T 3G coverage on my iPhone, and it's significantly faster than Verizon's network. So my idea is to get the Verizon iPad but use the AT&T 3G if I can, until I get Verizon LTE coverage in my area (or I visit an area with Verizon LTE).\nWould this work?\n\nA: Turns out I wasn't the only person that's been interested in this. There's an article on MacRumors that states that this is indeed possible, which is good news for me. The person that discovered it wrote:\n\nBig question on everyone's mind buying the Verizon iPad was whether data from AT&Ts 3G network would work on this iPad, or if Verizon/Apple would block this.\nI was one of the first to obtain a Verizon iPad and can happily confirm that this is allowed! I used my ATT iPhone 4S sim card and took out the Verizon sim, and data worked! You must apply the AT&T APN carrier settings before this works though.\nBTW APN carrier settings can be changed here: unlockit.co.nz\n\nedit: I just tested this and it works.

I have started a Perl script from the terminal that runs in the background:\n>perl myScript.pl &\n\nIf I logout, will it stop my script from running? \nThanks!\n\nA: In addition to @stuffe's answer, if you are logged in via ssh and run your command, it will die when you close the connection.  So, if you were at home and ssh'ed into your office workstation and executed your perl myScript.pl & command, it would die when you exit'ed from the ssh connection.\nTo avoid this problem, you'll want to use the nohup command, which dates back to the teletype days and stands for \"no hangup\" --- essentially it causes the command to ignore the POSIX HUP (hangup) signal.  It is used as:\nnohup perl myScript.pl &\n\nThis will keep running on your office workstation even after you have disconnected/logged out from your home machine.\n\nA: Yes, this is dead easy to test.  Write a perl script that appends the date to a file every minute, and run it in the background.  Log out, wait 5 minutes, log in, check for 5 entries corresponding to the times you are logged out. To get it working in future (too late if it's already running) use nohup as explained in another answer. You can background a foreground script after you start it (CTRL-Z) but you can only nohup it at execution\n", "Q: Installing Octave with Brew in Lion my first question on AskDifferent!

Recently there is little space in my MacBook and it turns out there are too many apps that I already removed from my iDevices but still stay in iTunes. I took it for granted that I can remove all of them in iTunes and those still on my iDevices will be copied back to iTunes when I sync it next time.\nUnfortunately this does not look correct.

I would like to daisychain a monitor through an external hard drive, using Thunderbolt. Are there any hard drives with an additional Thunderbolt port? Preferably compact and affordable. I would also be interested in an external HDD/SSD enclosure with the extra daisy-chaining port.\n\nA: The drives with two thunderbolt ports are intended to work in a chain as opposed to the drives that only have one port. By necessity, these can only exist at the end of the chain.\nArmed with this knowledge, you can always look at whatever models are for sale when you are considering a purchase and decide whether the added cost to have two ports outweighs the need to have a chainable device or buy a hub should one be eventually produced as a stand alone device.\n\nA: The LaCie Little Big Disk supports daisychaining and includes an extra port for it LaCie Little Big Disk. At $400, it's pretty comparable to other TB disk drives I've seen on the market. \n", "Q: Can you stream podcasts from the server to the iPad or iPhone?

The next two paragraphs only apply to the US iPads. \nInternationally (outside the US), the micro SIM slot is unlocked, so you will be able to insert a non-AT&T/non-VZW card in either and have service without needing to jailbreak the device. \nSee: http://www.apple.com/ipad/4g/ - the section on selecting a carrier and ready to take on the world.\n\nA: It appears that you can use an AT&T SIM in a Verizon iPad, but the reverse is not certain yet.\nArs Technica: Verizon iPad found to be compatible with AT&T's 3G network\n", "Q: Why do our iDevices give a page not found error when trying to connect to profile manager website? I want to know if anyone have also encountered this. We can connect to Profile Manager using one of our iPads (server.website.com/mydevices), but we can't connect using the rest of the iDevices we have. There are no difference between that iPad and the rest of the iDevices that we have, so we're wondering on what went wrong. The error is that the browser can't find the page. \nThis is a big problem for us because we can't enroll the devices in Profile Manager. \nAny information will help. If you need additional info, please put it in the comment section. Thank you.\nEDIT: as mentioned by bmike, we already have the DNS and SSL working. It's just this very weird behavior of being able to access the profile manager on every mac and that single iPad but not on other devices. Also note that we don't have that much experience on server administration, and it's safe to say that we don't know what we're doing and just following settings by the books.\n\nA: Have you verified that all required ports are open from the iPads to the server? (Port 1640 specifically, but also you'll want to ensure access to 80/443 for web and 2195/2196/5223 for push)\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion Server: Ports used by Profile Manager\nYou can also run some tests to see if this is a problem with the server itself or with the network. Connecting to the server's IP address from the iOS device will rule out DNS and other issues.\nI've found it helpful to open the Console app and watch /var/log/apache2/access_log for incoming requests so you can see which iOS devices are getting through to the server. That log shows you the IPv4 or IPv6 address of each connection request so you can detect which devices are networked correctly to send traffic to the server and narrow down in the chain where your problem lies.\nHopefully this helps others with DNS issues in getting to the same resolution as you.\n", "Q: Can I create a private calendar appointment with an iPhone? I understand that private is an Exchange concept, but I was hoping Apple would have implemented this feature since they are making use of ActiveSync. If the option is available it is certainly not obvious from the calendar creation screen. A bit of cursory searching turned up this whiny Apple forum thread, but alas no solution.\nOn the iPhone is it possible to create calendar appointments that are marked as private?\n\nA: No you can not.\nI assume you're using Exchange for you calendar, although you didn't specifically say so. \nYou can't necessarily create a private event, but you can create a subcalendar in Exchange that you can control the permissions of so that only you can see it. You can do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Outlook\n\n*Go to Calendars\n\n*Right click on your current main calendar and click New Calendar...\n\n*Create the new calendar under your Exchange account's Calendar section\n\n*Right click on your new calendar and select Properties.\n\n*Go to the Permissions tab.\n\n*Make sure the \"Default\" user is set to None.\n\n*Set your own permissions to \"Owner\" and remove any other users from the list.\nThis calendar should show up on your iPhone fairly quickly. If it doesn't, try disabling Calendar syncing in Settings → Mail, Contacts, Calendars → Exchange.\n\nA: Apparently Apple quietly added the ability to mark calendar events as private in iOS 8. At the bottom of the event details there is the option to toggle an event as Private. Setting this toggle works with Exchange.\nSee screenshots below:\n\n\n\nA: I tried it at work. Creating a private calendar subfolder with different permissions works fine. The problem is that other users cannot see my time as blocked, so they might plan an event which overlaps with my private event because they do not know I am not available. You can do it in the native Calendar application on a Mac by simply ticking off the \"Private\" checkbox, but not on an iPad or iPhone.\n", "Q: Which cellular carriers worldwide allow FaceTime calls over 3G/4G Networks? Do any carriers allow for FaceTime video and/or voice calls to pass over normal data channels directly from an iOS device? If not, what alternatives exist short of jail breaking or other gray solutions that would run afoul of the current policies of the cellular carriers? (for example WiFi devices that in turn use 3G / 4G for their connectivity)\n\nA: Standard, Apple doesn't allow you to make FaceTime calls on a 3G network. And however 4G is often faster then WiFi, the LTE network isn't supported either.\nThere are however some ways you can enable FaceTime over 3G using Cydia (so jailbreak) or you can use your personal hotspot feature (jailbreak too) to enable this.\nUPDATE:\nI've tested the method of Redmondpie (with iFile) and with a Belgium Provider (Proximus) it works like a charm!\n", "Q: Why does Disk Utility create EFI partitions on external disks? A technical told me about the EFI partition that...\n\n\n*\n\n*...it's only there in case your computer will do an EFI update so the update files can be loaded onto the EFI partition.\nThis is consistant with what Wikipedia says:\n\n\n*\n\n*The EFI partition is initially blank and not used for booting. However, the EFI partition is used as a staging area for firmware updates.\nApples's Software Update utility does not update the firmware of non apple hardware.\nQuestion\nWhy then does Disk Utility create EFI partitions on external disks?\n/dev/disk1\n       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n       0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1\n       1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n       2:       Microsoft Basic Data HEAP                    150.0 GB   disk1s2\n       3:                  Apple_HFS Backup matt             150.1 GB   disk1s3\n       4:                  Apple_HFS Freedom                 199.5 GB   disk1s4\n\n\nA: So you can image the drive and get things set up while your new drive is in an enclosure and only swap it into your Mac as an internal drive once it is tested and ready to go. Also, not having to code special exceptions when to and when not to write an EFI partition is sound engineering practice.  \nYou can't write buggy code if you don't write any code.\n\nA: Apple has a partitioning policy that determines if a disk will have an EPI partition. This policy is the same for internal, as well as, external disks. The policy is shown below. The image is from the site: Technical Note TN2166: Secrets of the GPT\n\nI noticed a funny thing about having a EFI partition. If you delete this partition after the Disk Utility has created it, then the Disk Utility will not format the other partitions, on the same disk, with any type of file system. This means the Erase and Add partition operations will fail.\n", "Q: How do I type ² or ³ on an Apple keyboard (International English layout)? I use ² and ³ a lot in e-mails. When using my Belgian Windows keyboard and a custom keymap it was easy to type this in Mac OS X as I assigned the appropriate key. These are the mathematical symbols for squared and cubed, or raised to the power of 2 and power of 3.\nNow I switched to a QWERTY International English Apple keyboard and I'm unable to type these characters easily. I've to copy-paste them or select them and make them superscript.\nIs there a way to easily type these characters with touching my mouse or need to copy-paste?\n\nA: There are some important gotchas with the other solutions posted here.\nFor one, symbol and text substitution entries only work in Cocoa apps. If you want a truly system-wide solution that works in all applications, this is not an option.\nAlso, apps like KeyRemap4MacBook are great, but relying on them means you have to keep the app running in the background all the time, which may not be what you want.\nCustom keyboard layouts to the rescue\nLuckily, remapping keys can be done in a way that will work for any type of application, and without any additional software!\nMac OS X has supported .keylayout files since version 10.2 (Jaguar). You can create your own keyboard layout, or rather, tweak the default one you’re using right now. Simply remap a keyboard combination you never use (for me, there are plenty of those) to the ² and ³ symbols, and that’s it. \nIn my custom QWERTY keyboard layout, I can simply press ⌥ + ⇧ + 2 to enter ², and ⌥ + ⇧ + 3 to enter ³. (My custom AZERTY layout has these mappings, too.)\nHow to create a custom keyboard layout\nTo create new keyboard layouts or modify existing ones, I’d recommend Ukelele.app. It has an option to create a new keyboard layout based on the one that’s currently in use.\nAfter you’ve created your custom layout, there’s no need for the application anymore — you certainly don’t need to keep it running in the background.\nHow to install a custom keyboard layout\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the .keylayout file to the Keyboard Layouts folder within ~/Library (if you want to install it only for the current user) or /Library (if you want to install the layout system-wide).\n\n*Reboot (if you installed the layout system-wide), or log out and log in again (if you installed it for the current user only).\n\n*Enable the new keyboard layout via System Preferences › Language & Text › Input Sources.\n\n\nHow to make a custom keyboard layout the system default\nOptionally, you could make the custom keyboard layout the system default by running the Setup Assistant with root privileges. This way, it will be used for the login screen, and any new user accounts you create will default to this layout as well. Note that this can only be done for keyboard layouts in /Library/Keyboard Layouts (i.e., layouts that have been installed system-wide).\nsudo rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone; sudo \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Setup Assistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Setup Assistant\"\n\nYou will have to create a new user account in order to complete the Setup Assistant — but don’t worry, you can delete the new account afterwards.\nAdding a custom icon to the keyboard layout\nOS X will use the following default icon for your custom keyboard layout:\n\nThis icon will show up in the preference pane, and in the “Input menu” in the menu bar.\nTo replace this with your own icon, create a 16×16px image, and save it in .icns format in the same directory as the keyboard layout itself, using the same file name (only the extension differs). For example, my custom QWERTY layout is named qwerty.keylayout, so if I wanted to use a custom icon, it’d have to be named qwerty.icns.\n\nA: Making custom keymaps for OS X is very easy using Ukelele\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/ukelele\n\nA: If you can enter the ² and ³ once, you can put it in as a substitution in System Preferences, Language & Text -> Text.\nPut something unique on the left side, like ^^2, then paste your symbol in on the right.\nYou'll may have to quit & restart each application for it to work, and some applications it may not work correctly in. Any that use a web view (including Mail, which was what you specifically asked about, and Safari) will need you to specifically enable Text Substitution from the Edit menu. Individually. Or you can run this command once in Terminal, and it will change the default for every web view:\ndefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true\n\nThis is from Macworld, but the Macworld article assumes Lion would make this step unnecessary. It didn't. Maybe Mountain Lion will.\nAs for entering the ² and ³ into System Preferences: You can use the character palette or paste to enter the symbol into the right side. It sounds like you already have this part figured out, though.\n\n\nA: For those looking for simple shortcut to do this in a Word document or other Office program: \n(Command + Shift) + plus/equals key\n\nThen type number you want then repeat above shortcut to return script size to normal.\n(Also works without the Shift on some systems.)\n\nA: (None of the other answers explain how to type a superscript besides copy/pasting.)\nTo type a superscript character in an application that doesn't support superscript, you can use Character Viewer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit > Emoji & Symbols ⌃⌘Space\n\n*You'll find these under the Symbols > ① Digits list\n\n\nHere they are for copy pasting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Superscript: ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹\n\n*Subscript: ₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉\n\nA: If you are using 10.7, you could also perhaps add the desired characters to the Character Picker, as described in\nHow to add characters to the press and hold character picker in OS X Lion?\n\nA: KeyRemap4Macbook\ncan be used to remap keys in OSX and is compatible with Lion. I've used it to remap the volume buttons only. You should be able to figure out your solution using  this tool.\n\n\nA: You can use the Character maps on a Mac or install a 3th party software like PopChar.\n\nA: Highlight the digit you wish to shrink and elevate. Press cmd+- to resize. In format under the 'font' heading, click the 'settings' icon on the row with bold, italic and underline to find advanced settings. Select the baseline shift option to elevate the digit. A bit clunky, but if you don't need it often it's a simple option.\n\nA: I do something similar with Typinator (card suit symbols), which is from the same company as PopChar. I think there are competitors that do the same thing. I don't treat the symbols as superscripts. I looked up the Unicode characters for them (superscript numbers are also separate Unicode code points). Every font I use has these glyphs; of course, your mileage may vary.\n", "Q: After iPad restore (from iCloud) apps still appear as 'waiting' I just got the new iPad, and since I backed up my old iPad using iCloud, I restored from the iCloud backup. After restore, it restarted and began downloading all the apps.  \nNow, I have all these apps on my Mac, so I plugged in the iPad at this point and clicked \"Sync\". The sync has not finished yet (it's still copying music), but iTunes has restored all of the apps first.\nHowever, on the iPad all of the apps still appear as 'waiting' even though iTunes seems to have installed them.\nWill this magically fix itself after sync, do I need to reboot, or is it more complicated?\nEDIT\nI gave up, and did a backup and restore via iTunes.\n\nA: Here is a quick and short how-to guide. \nThey say:\n\nA final step involves re-downloading all your apps from the App Store,\n  a process that the iPhone/iPad handled automatically.\n\nSo my guess, your iPad and iTunes are clever enough to handle it by itself. When they notice an App is already installed, they wil leave it alone. If they find an uninstalled app, it will be installed.\n\nA: NightLeopard, iTunes does check version of app already (successfully i.e. 100% downloaded and) installed on an iOS device before iTunes attempts to re-download it. \n\nA: I had the same \"waiting\" problem as well.  I think what is happening is that lots of people are hitting the iCloud server at the same time on the \"Happy New iPad\" day and the system is slowing down.  I did a hard shutdown and then let it sit by itself - and then slowly but surely the apps started to resync. So sit back, grab a beverage of choice, and let the cloud do its thing (slowly).\n\nA: Mine was stuck on waiting for over 8 hours. So, I just backed up my phone onto iTunes on my computer, then went into my phone's settings and deleted my iCloud account. Next time I connected to iTunes on my laptop, it couldn't sync via iCloud and had to just do it old school through iTunes. Everything downloaded just fine, and quickly.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't boot anymore after a fall I have an old MacBook Pro (late 2006) and he won't boot anymore.

What are you thinking of when you read this story and what do you think I can do about it?\n\nA: I think the best thing to do to rescue whatever you can (RAM, harddrive, Bluetooth chips, WiFi antenna,...) and sell them. By so, you have a little start up budget for your new Mac (which you gonna have to buy anyway!)\nIf you don't know how to get all those things out, you can try one of the tutorials at iFixit.\n\nA: I'm afraid you're probably right about the logic board being damaged. Unfortunately, that repair is not inexpensive. For a flat rate depot repair, you're looking at around $1240. For an in store (at an Apple Retail Store), you're looking at a little under $1000. \nIt looks like you've tried all the troubleshooting steps you can do when it shuts off after a minute. \nAs the folks in the Apple Store will tell you, you're going to be better off looking at a new machine.\n", "Q: How do I fix the 3-5 second lag when typing with an Apple Bluetooth keyboard on a Windows 7 PC? I've been trying to use an Apple Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard with my Windows 7 PC (My own build, not Apple hardware).  If I stop typing for as few as 10-15 seconds, when I start typing again and if I type continuously, there is a lag of 3-5 seconds before the text shows up on the screen. If I type a few keystrokes and then stop, nothing happens. However once I start typing again, all of the previous keystrokes are sent at once.\nI'm not sure if this is a driver issue or a problem with my bluetooth adapter.  In Device Manager, it shows 2 Keyboard Devices; 1 on Blutooth HID Device and another on USB Input Device (Logitech Download Assistant).  I am not sure what the Logitech one is. I do have a Logitech Performance MX Mouse, but why that would be under Keyboards, I don't know. Under Bluetooth USB, it shows my Bluetooth adapter from IVT Corporation, Driver Version 6.2.71.213 from June 24, 2010.\nHow do I fix the 3-5 second lag when typing with an Apple Bluetooth keyboard on a Windows 7 PC?\n\nA: The frequency of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi overlaps and can interfere with the Bluetooth frequency that is going to the keyboard to the Mac. \nSome PC have better response with this fix:\nYou just need to go into your Wi-Fi settings by going into the browser and entering the router's IP address (usually \"192.168.1.1\"). Enter the username and password when prompted. There should be a wireless setting for your wireless frequency, called 'channels' and normally is put the 'automatic' you just have to change that from 'automatic' to 'channel 1' this should out your router to the lowest frequency. After saving the settings just to be sure turn off the router for 30 seconds and check your keyboard if it is working (may need a restart of the iMac and the keyboard). This should resolve the problem.\n", "Q: How should I proceed when I get the \"Unable to Purchase\" alert from the iOS App Store? Recently, whenever I want to buy something from the iOS App Store or update my existing apps, I get the usual password dialog, but after a second that disappears and I see the following alert:\n\nAfter clicking OK and then entering my password the app installs just fine (and gets billed correctly).\nStrangely sometimes the apps mentioned in the Unable to Purchase alert get marked as Waiting... on the homescreen, even though there are no updates for them.\nWhen this happens I am unable to start those apps, until later, when it magically disappears again.\nThis happens on both an iPhone 4S and an iPad 2, running iOS 5.1.\n\nA: According to a previous discussion on the Apple Discussion boards, you should sign out and sign in again in your Store settings.\nAnd if that doesn't work, their is always another fix, which involves downloading a 3th party software. No jailbreak required!\n", "Q: What's the battery life of the new iPad 4G with LTE disabled/enabled? I saw a video about the new iPad and it showed that you could disable LTE.\n\nApple had to increase the battery capacity in the new iPac because upgrades like LTE and the new display draw significantly more power.\nQuestion\n\n*\n\n*What's the battery life of the new iPad 4G with LTE disabled/enabled?\n\n*Apple's product specs are unspecific: \"Up to 9 hours of surfing the web using cellular data network.\"\n\n\nA: I'm not sure. But what I do know it the fact the battery in the new iPad has 70% more capacity and people describe it as massive.\nIt has a massive 11,666mAh (the iPad 2 has just 6994mAH). The same battery in an iPad 2 would give... \n\nTo put that in context, an iPad 2 with with this new battery, if such\n  a device existed, would probably last close to 17 hours on Wi-Fi.\n\nSo I'm as curious as you are about the finding of the new battery! I'm waiting for the first reviews (it shouldn't be that long anymore since the first iPad are already sold...)\n\nA: I'm not sure about the length of the battery, but I have some anecdotal evidence that may be useful. \nThe iPad was fully charged at 6 AM, but I didn't use it until 11. By 3 PM, after watching  two episodes of Game of Thrones (55 and 45 minutes long) among other things, that battery was showing 20% charge.

Well we can't have everything our way. Love it tho.\n\nA: well, according to the official Apple Website, if you scroll about halfway down the page that I gave the link to, on the right side, you should find a small paragraph, saying that the battery life of the new IPad is actually 10 hours.\n", "Q: Remove iOS 5.1 notification from the main screen?

In iPhoto '11 (latest version, on Mac OS Lion), can I make a smart album for all photos of a certain size (e.g. 960x640)? Can I make a smart album containing photos of multiple sizes?\nEDIT\nI answered my own question. See my answer below. Yes, it's possible.\n\nA: iPhoto doesn't seem to have that capability in its Smart Folders, however, you can find the pictures using Finder.\nYou failed to mention what version of Mac OS X (or iPhoto) you have, but the following settings are available since Leopard as far as I can remember:\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Finder window, and on the top menu, click:\nFile -> New Smart Folder ⌥⌘N\n\n\n*Now you need to add one or two conditions for this Smart Folder. You want to specify the width or height (or both) of the images. Click the (+) symbol:\n\nNote: the black cover is because I have some NDA protected names there\n\n\n*On the little bar that appears (that says \"Kind\" \"Equals\"), click on Kind and select \"Other\". In the SearchBox of this sheet that appears, type Pixel and the results should look like this:\n\n\n\n*Now select Pixel Height and click OK. If you also want to specify the Width, repeat steps two and three.\n\n\n*Now change your values to reflect something like this:\n\nYou will want to change the Width/Height values. In the above example, I'm seeing all the images that are greater than 1920x1080.\nNotice I forgot to change 'is greater than' when taking the screenshot and therefore the width is using 'Equals'.\nYou can save this Smart Folder (notice the tiny save button in the top right corner) and it will be automatically updated all the time. You can even drag it to your Sidebar for fast/easy access.\nSadly, iPhoto 9.2.x (latest at the time of writing), doesn't allow you to create a smart folder with these settings, which is kinda surprising if you ask me.\n\nA: Answering my own question. Here's how you do it:\n\nYou need to set it a condition for [size][space][unicode ×][space][size 2], for example: 320 × 480. Not straightforward, but it works. However, it doesn't actually care which order you put the width and height, so this one will find 320x480 images as well as 480x320 images.\n\nA: Use Aperture (demo is OK) to set up the smart album. Aperture has more criteria that can be used (such as pixel dimensions).\niPhoto will still open the Library, and will display the Smart Album just fine with the correct files matched.\nNote: you cannot edit the settings in iPhoto, you have to go back to Aperture if you wish to tweak the settings).\nI used this approach today to set the following Pano smart album:\nAperture settings:\n\nAperture display (cropped):\n\niPhoto display (cropped):\n\n", "Q: How to take music from cassette tapes to iPod So I have this large cardboard box full of hundreds of cassette tapes with music I absolutely positively had to buy in the 1980s and '90s. If I wanted to listen to the music contained on those tapes on my iPod, I imagine I could follow a process something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put new batteries in my old Walkman®\n\n*Connect some sort of cable between the headphone jack on my Walkman and the audio jack on my mid-2011 MacBook Air\n\n*Play tapes on the Walkman and record the incoming music on the MacBook Air using some sort of software.\n\n*Use iTunes Match to upgrade the quality of the resulting audio files.\n\n*Put the iTunes Match audio files onto my iPod.\nI know this workflow would take a long time (each tape would have to play its full length), and I don't know if it would work.\nSo my questions is, what should I do? Again, my goal is to get music from my audiotapes to my iPod without having to repurchase all the tracks. The procedure outlined above is just my guess at a solution; if your answer doesn't look much like that process, but it doesn't cost much more than iTunes Match, I'm open to ideas. I'd love a solution that worked faster than my idea.\n\nA: For step 3, I'd recommend Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack Pro which has the ability to break up the incoming audio into tracks for you and import it directly into iTunes.\nBut otherwise, you've got to do pretty much exactly what you planned to do.\n\nA: There are a number of cassette tape decks with USB ports on them now that can make this process a little smoother. The advantage to going with a USB-enabled deck is you don't have to worry about output levels. Or more specifically, you don't have to worry about clipping the input to your Mac with a too hot analog output from the tape deck.\nWith your approach you'd need to scan every tape, look for the peak level, and make certain the output level of the deck didn't clip the input when it played through that peak level. That's a time consuming process. The USB-enabled decks let you gloss over that.\nLooking around, it appears that ION makes the most popular line of decks for this purpose, thought I can't personally speak to their quality. It is listed as plug-and-play on Mac though their minimum version is 10.4, so I'd check with them to make sure they support the CoreAudio changes in 10.7.x before buying. They make software that will connect to the deck and automate the extraction and splitting process for you. It doesn't mention if the software can play the tape back at a fast-than-realtime speed. Probably it cannot. So your transfer is going to be limited to realtime.\nOnce it's in iTunes, Match should do its thing and upgrade the tracks.\n\nA: I'm afraid there is no alternative without playing the full length of the cassette. Since it's an analog signal, you can't just move a file from the cassette to your Mac...\nIf you want to convert your VHS to DVD, you have to play your entire tape too because it's a analog signal.\nBut I'm sure, since you care so much about the music, you won't bother listen (and enjoy!) the cassettes one last time on your walkman while recording them to your Mac.  \nI've done this with my collection of cassettes a few years ago, and I must say, it was a true delight to listen them once more with the \"cassette noise\"! Now I can enjoy this lovely music everywhere I want!\nSo, do as you thought and enjoy your music!\n", "Q: Will the 3G SIM card from my original 2010 iPad work in the new 2012 iPad, or will I need a new SIM card? I have the original 2010 iPad 3G, and when I purchased it I also got a SIM card for Rogers 3G data service here in Canada.\nCan I simply remove the 3G SIM card from my original 2010 iPad, and insert it into my new 2012 iPad when it arrives?  i.e. is it compatible and will my data plan continue to operate as before, but on the new iPad?\nThen, even if it is compatible, is there an advantage to getting a new SIM card? Are there data features for the new iPad (e.g. higher speed?) only enabled by a new SIM card?\n\nA: This will depend largely on your carrier. If they're offering 4G/LTE service with the iPad 3, you may need a new SIM card. If they're not offering that service in your area, it shouldn't matter if you have a new SIM card or not. Your best bet is to ask your carrier.\n\nA: The Apple website states you need a:\n\nMicro-SIM card tray\n\nSame as the iPad 2. So I'm pretty sure the cards have the two dimensions. Otherwise their would have been some complaints about not fitting the SIMcard.\n", "Q: AppleTV sees my Mac Mini but It can't access its information I have the latest version of the Mac Mini with the updated software on my Apple TV 2. It can see my Mac Mini but when it try to access it's information with iTunes open I says it is loading but eventually errors out. I can ping successfully from my Mac Mini to the Apple TV. I have the latest version of iTunes.\nMy MacBook Pro and Mac Pro can be accessed successfully on the Apple TV. All three are running Lion with the latest updates. \nThe Mac Mini did at one time work on the Apple TV. The firewall is off on the Mac Mini.\nI went through the steps listed here without any success.\nAny suggestions to get the Mac Mini and Apple TV to work again would be appreciated.\n\nA: From the Apple Discussion forum:\n\nIn iTunes, Edit>Preferences>Sharing>Share my library on my local\nnetwork.\nI saw this was unchecked, and checked it.\n\nAnd maybe more meaningful:\n\n\"Once Home Sharing has been turned on, Apple TV will automatically\nfind iTunes libraries on your local network that have Home Sharing\nturned on using the account name you entered. The shared libraries\nwill appear in Computers on the main menu of Apple TV.\"\nThe implication is that a \"shared library\" must exist on the computer\nthat has Home Sharing turned on in order to be found.\n\nAnd to conclude:\n\nFirst things first, unplug the ethernet cable from your apple TV and\ncheck your settings under Setting > General > Network. Note the IP\naddress.\nSecondly, plug the ethernet cable back in and check your\nsettings. Setting > General > Network - are they the same or totally\ndifferent? If they are different you most likely have an issue where\nyour iTunes Homeshared Library is running off of a different IP\nAddress than your Apple TV.\n\nAlso, make sure you have your ports right!\n", "Q: iTunes on OS X: How to rename files using in-line editing in main window, using keyboard only? When I'm on my Windows computer and using iTunes, I can conveniently hit the F2 key when I have a song selected, rename the song using the in-line edit field that appears, and then hit Enter to commit the change.  No mouse or Get Info dialog is used in the process.\nIs there a keyboard-only method in iTunes on OS X for quickly renaming a song?\nOn OS X, I can avoid iTunes' Get Info dialog by using the mouse to click twice ... not double clicking, but rather: click, wait, click again .. (and getting the timing right is annoying!)  Such clicking activates in-line editing functionality (so I know it exists) but it requires the mouse. How can I activate the in-line editing functionality with just the keyboard?\nI tried F2 on OS X and that didn't work.  I also tried Enter, which can be used to in-line edit file names in Finder, but that didn't work either :-/\nI'm interested in renaming files with the keyboard only because I have a ton of songs imported with \"Artist Name - Song Name\" titles to correct.\n\nA: There sure is.\nWhen you have a song selected, you can press ⌘ + return and it will allow you to quickly edit the song title.\n", "Q: How can I remove an individual name from a Group on the Autofill feature of Mail? How can I remove an individual name from a Group on the Autofill feature of Mail?\nI can remove the individual from the Group in Contacts, but when I use the same Group to create a new email, it keeps adding the removed address anyway!\n\nA: You've edited the groups in the correct place — Address Book — but there's one more step you need to take. Mail.app reads the core data from Address Book when it starts up. After editing entries in Address Book you'll need to quit and restart Mail.app for any changes to be recognized by Mail.\n", "Q: What do I do with an old, dead iPod? I have a third generation iPod classic from 2005 (20GB). Nothing catastrophic has happened to it, but it has sat in a box in the basement for the past two years. When it went into the box, it worked, but now when I push the power button, nothing happens. When I plug it in to a charger (even when I leave it for an extended period of time), I don't see anything happening.\nIs there either\n\n\n*\n\n*anything useful I can do with this device or the parts it contains,\n\n*anyone else who could benefit from my donating it to them, or \n\n*a responsible way to dispose of it?\n\nA: If you're 100% convinced it's broken, you can try one of the 75 tutorials listed here. \nOtherwise, there’s always the Apple Recycling program for iPods. It won't cost you any money and I'm sure Apple will find a way to reuse your iPod.\n\nA: Well, personally, I would sell it. You can try the Apple Recycling Program since they usually give you SOME money back, 90% of the time they can figure out a way to reuse it, and they could even give you a discount towards your next iPod purchase.\nIf you live in the United States, you can also try using Gazelle. They buy old Apple products and send you cash, they even pay for the shipping.\n\nA: Apple Recycling Program\nYou can recycle it and receive a 10% discount on a new iPod. This is not only profitable for you and apple, but also a responsible way of deposing it.\n\nApple often achieves a 90 percent recovery rate by weight of the original product.\n\n\nA: I would be tempted to get the tools needed to open the case and play with it to learn how the hardware was designed and assembled.\nYou can always choose to recycle it and might instead decide that the iPod case will make a perfect housing for the many new computers that are being released like the Raspberry Pi or the Cstick cotton candy.\nYou will of course need to have some machining skills to adapt the case, but most cities have maker groups where you can get help in a machine shop and reusing a solid case is better than recycling in my mind. You can then recycle the innards as needed once you have your new project off the ground.\n\n\nA: I would try to fix it, sell it, or recycle it. In that order.\nTry looking into fixing the iPod if your up for the task, since like you said there should be nothing really wrong with it other than a super dead battery. Probably the only thing you would need to buy to fix it  is a new battery and a few simple tools to aid in opening the case. I recommend looking at the Repair Manual for your iPod from iFixit. Once you fix it, you tremendously increase its value and make it a better candidate to sell to people who don't like fixing things themselves. A 20GB iPod still holds its own in 2012 for playing music, and there are a lot of people who would find this device useful, and hence the parts as well even if you don't fix it. Its worth much more than most small electronics things going to be recycled.\nAfter fixing it or not you could try to sell it on eBay, a yard sale, flea-market, Craigslist, etc. Working today March 16, 2012 its worth about $50 USD and for parts about $10 according to recent eBay completed listing prices. And again if you don't fix it you can still try to sell it for parts.  \nHowever if you don't fix it that may not be a good idea if you have personal information still stored on the iPod, eg address book, photos, etc.  Because you will not get a chance to erase it. But if your not worried about losing any personal information from the iPod then by all means you can just sell it as is without having to break it open.\nAnd lastly if you just don't want to deal with it anymore than just getting rid of it. Check into your local responsible recycling options, you may be able to simply drop it off at a nearby retail store or community waste disposal location that accepts electronics waste. Contact the people who take away your trash and see what their options and recommendations are. If your in the USA you may find the following local recycling links from Gazelle.com useful.\n\nA: I have that exact same model in the same situation.  I've found that the batteries in those old iPods tend to not last very long when kept in storage.  If you want to make the iPod work again, you can get replacement batteries at a number of sites.  You can also replace the hard drive with a Compact Flash card to turn it into a solid-state player (which will get even more battery life), or use the existing hard drive to add storage to some underpowered netbook or the like.  Or, as others have mentioned, you can return it to Apple and get 10% off a new iPod.\n\nA: If it's the same one I have (this one), you may be using the wrong power adapter.\nAlthough the dock connector (the wide bit) is the same one Apple is using on nearly all of their products these days, that model of iPod will only charge with a Firewire cable, and most (all?) of the power adapters and cables Apple is making these days are USB.\nHopefully it will come to life when plugged into a Firewire port like mine did.\nIf so, you could keep using it; you may even be able to replace the hard drive with a more modern-sized one for less than the cost of a new iPod Classic.\nOr, you could stick it back in the basement (which is what I did, probably going to hack it later), go with any of the others' options, or one I'd like to add:  you might be able to just give it away to somebody.  It might be hard to locate someone who wants it, but I'm sure such a person exists.  You could try http://www.freecycle.org/ (never used it myself yet).\n\nA: You could use the internal hard drive and screen for many a hobbyist project, as long as they aren't what is preventing the iPod from working. IMO, the battery is probably dead as a result of how long it's been stored between charges.\n\nA: It won't switch on or take a charge because the battery has degraded. This happens when:\n1) You store a device with a dead battery (or battery below 50% charge), this applies to Li-Ion and Li-Po batteries!\n2) You store a device with a battery in a cold environment (applies to all batteries)\nIf you can get your hands on a replacement battery, it'll likely work fine (so long as the old cell hasn't leaked and damaged the circuitry in any way).\nIf you don't want to bother replacing the battery yourself, I'd put it up on eBay for around £20 as \"spares & repairs\", making it clear that it's probably just in need of a replacement battery (some people will have a broken iPod with a perfectly functional battery, so between the two they can make one working unit).\nDisassembly is simple enough, battery replacement is simple enough, reassembly can be slightly more tricky, but a little care and consideration will see it right!\n\nA: The same thing happen to my ipod bettery to but I did find a solution:\nIf your battery get dead for a long time and you need to make it work again all what you should do is opening the ipod and take the battery out. Take a charger \"12v\" then touch the teeth of the battery many times and put the  battery again in the ipod. Put the iPod in the normal charger then wait for 4 hours and it will work \n", "Q: Can iTunes Match recognize songs recorded from analog sources (line-in, cassette, vinyl LP, or FM radio), or only digitally-extracted CD audio? This question about converting cassette music for an iPod inspired me to ask:\nCan the iTunes Match service provided by Apple recognize songs recorded from an analog source, such as recording via analog line-input from a cassette player, an LP turntable, or any other device's line-out .. say, even FM radio?\nHas anybody tried a variety of analog sources with iTunes Match?  Was there any success, mixed or otherwise, or no success?\nWhat is publicly known about the iTunes Match analysis process or algorithms, and knowing how those may function, is it reasonable to expect that the service would work on an analog recording as well?  Other than quality, is there something inherent to music extracted/ripped digitally from a CD that lends itself to easier analysis for matching?\n\nUPDATE:  I found this thread at Apple Support communities which contains strong anecdotal evidence that audio recorded from vinyl LP can be matched.  I'm still interested in knowing if other sources can be matched as well (cassette, FM radio, etc.)\n\nA: Analog Source over Line-In → iTunes Match:  It works!  Kind of.\nI just ran my experiment.  While I don't have a cassette player handy, I did have the means to make a reasonably good quality analog recording to try with iTunes Match, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used this old CD player:\n\n\n*And this excellent CD:\n\n\n*I plugged the CD player into my Windows* PC's blue audio input (line in) with this cable:\n\n\n*I recorded the entire CD using EAC's \"Record WAV\" feature. Then, I split up the resulting single, large WAV file into individual WAV files (using EAC's \"Process WAV\" menu item.)  I judged the track boundaries by eye/ear, and I ended up within a second or two of the actual track lengths reported elsewhere.\n\n*I compressed the WAVs into MP3 using EAC w/LAME.\n\n*I renamed and copied the resulting MP3 files to my Mac.\n\n*I added the MP3s to iTunes, and then added them to iCloud.  After a few minutes, iTunes Match finished doing its thing, and 10 of 11 tracks were Matched.  Proof:\n\nSummary\nIt doesn't appear that a strictly digital-sourced (i.e. ripped) MP3 input is required for iTunes Match to succeed (somewhat) at matching.  However, I did make sure line levels were appropriate during recording to avoid clipping, and though my recording was analog, the source is high quality.\nWhat I still don't know is if iTunes Match would work with audio cassette, LP, or FM-sourced audio.  Does anybody care to run a follow-up experiment? :-)\n\n* (my apologies for using Windows for the recording part of this experiment. I'm not yet familiar with audio recording/editing on the Mac.)\n\nA: Here you can find how iTunes Match handles it's content. And I'm afraid they are quite obvious about it: \n\nOne of the big questions about Apple’s upcoming iTunes Match is how\n  the online music service will handle songs acquired from non-standard\n  sources, like analog LPs, or yes, file-sharing networks.\nComing this fall, iTunes Match will scan your iTunes library and make\n  available in the cloud all the songs you’ve purchased online or ripped\n  from CDs.\n\nWhen you read through the post, it became clear to me Apple didn't left any gaps where you could turn your old, analog material into the cloud. You must have bought the item before (either in the iTunes Store or either on CD)...\nMaybe some geniuses can find a workaround, but I don't think so. If you add a song from your analog media, iTunes Match won't be able to match the song, but it will upload it to the cloud anyway so you can download it on another device!\n\nA: So it is still  unclear if digitizing a purchased analog copy of a song from an 33 1/3 LP or 45 single, or a cassette tape will be matched.  My plan has been to try the cassette route first.. when I cleared out most of my cassette tapes, I left a drawer full intact to test this with with the thinking, I've paid for them already, so this may and should work in an ideal world.  There could well be some signal analysis that detects the source; certainly FM recorded content should be rejected, but not purchased LP/single/cassette content.\n\nA: It does work from cassette, although you have to separately identify each song. I used Audiology and a $25 cassette converter (that also works like a cassette walkman). It's a little labor intensive, especially finding the beginning and end of songs. \nYou can do the whole cassette as one album, but it doesn't split all the songs down with iMatch.\n", "Q: Average start up time for Macbook Pro running Lion? I have a new MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.4GHz and I am noticing that the start up timeis about 60 seconds from power on to launching Safari. \nIs this an average start up time?\n\nA: Yes. Your start up time is dependent on how fast your hard drive is, how full it is, and how your OS is running. If you're running a normal 5400 RPM drive with around 50% of the storage space filled, 60 seconds is about normal. A few things you could do to help this out are:\nReset the SMC\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro\n\n*Plug in the MagSafe adapter and make sure it is charging\n\n*Simultaneously press the shift + alt + control + Power buttons and hold them for about 10 seconds. Let go after that.\n\n*Restart your Mac (and move on to the following suggestion):\nReset the PRAM\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the power button to start up your MacBook Pro\n\n*Hold down the following keys:⌘ + alt + P + R until you hear the start up chime sound twice.\n\n*Let go and boot normally.\nDisk Repair\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility from /Applications/Utilities\n\n*Select your startup volume, probably named \"Macintosh HD\"\n\n*Click on Repair Disk\nPermissions Repair\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility from /Applications/Utilities\n\n*Select your startup volume, probably named \"Macintosh HD\"\n\n*Click on Repair Disk Permissions\n\nA: Nope. It should be about half or less.\nTry this:\n\n\n*\n\n*PRAM reset\n\n\n*\n\n*(Re-)start the computer.\n\n*Press and hold the ⌘+⌥+P+R keys. You must press this key combination before the gray screen appears.\n\n*Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time.\n\n\n*SMC reset\n\n\n*\n\n*The procedure depends on what kind of Mac you have. Follow the link and go to the section Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) to see what you have to do.\n\n\n\nA: MacBook Pro 2011\n15 seconds restart time\nAfter having my Logic Board replaced it restarted in 45 seconds but that was quickly fixed with, during power up, OPT + CMD + r + p and wait for second chime. This resets the PRAM.\nIt is again restarting at 15 seconds.\n\nA: 60 seconds is rather long (although mine doesn't do much better...). And their seems to be a lot of people suffering from this problem... (on Macrumors and the Apple Discussion forum are some reports of people with problems like you).\nYou could boost your Mac performance if you like. Here is a good tutorial how to boost up your Mac Startup process. \nAnd if that doesn't help you out, here is a wiki where they go something more in depth about the start up process.\n", "Q: Is \"Quit others\" possible? If one holds down Option and Control whilst clicking an icon in the Dock, the resulting menu contains a Hide Others command, such that only the clicked application is visible on screen. This is helpful when making a presentation, recording a screencast, or in other circumstances. The one problem is that the programs running in the background can still generate errors, etc., that might awkwardly cause them to reappear during the screencast, presentation, etc.\nWould it be possible to create some sort of command (or Service, or something) to \"Quit Others\" -- that is, a command that would quit all applications except the frontmost one?\n\nA: Using the SO answer referenced by Diago, maybe something like the following modification can exclude the currently active application:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set the visible of every process to true\n    set app_name to name of the first process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\nset white_list to {\"Finder\", app_name}\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set process_list to the name of every process whose visible is true\n    end tell\n    repeat with i from 1 to (number of items in process_list)\n        set this_process to item i of the process_list\n        if this_process is not in white_list then\n            tell application this_process\n                quit\n            end tell\n        end if\n    end repeat\non error\n    tell the current application to display dialog \"An error has occurred!\" & return & \"This script will now quit\" buttons {\"Quit\"} default button 1 with icon 0\nend try\n\nThen you can add this as a service using Automator, and assign a keyboard shortcut for it in the Keyboard section of System Preferences.\n\nA: There is an answer on SO about this Quit All Applications using Applescript? with code for an AppleScript that can quit all applications. I would guess it just needs to be modified to check what the active application is and then installed as a service on the Mac.

Scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a Mac running OS X Lion, and then VMware Fusion 4.x running Windows XP and Windows 7 as virtual machines.\n\n*I use a Logitech MX310 Optical Mouse.  It has 6 buttons and I think it's the greatest mouse ever invented and I own a few (one is at the office). What I especially like are the back and forward buttons.\n\n*If I use the MX310 under native Windows (I have a PC, too) the buttons naturally act as the back and forward actions in Windows Explorer, Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc. to navigate backwards and forwards within folders, web pages, etc.\n\n*When I use the MX310 on the Mac, I install the Logitech Control Center preferences pane, which makes sure the buttons also work as expected within Finder, Safari, Firefox, etc.\n\n\nProblem:  When running Windows (whether XP or 7) as VMs under VMware Fusion, the MX310's back and forward buttons no longer work in Windows as they are supposed to.  Under Windows XP, nothing happens.  Under Windows 7, they have the effect of moving and resizing a window to occupy the left half of the screen, or the right half of the screen (depending on the button pressed.)  So, I think there is a signal getting sent to the VM, just the wrong one.\nHow can I get the back/forward buttons working properly within my Windows virtual machine instances under VMware Fusion?  I'd even be happy with some key/button re-mapping kludge running under the Windows VM that simulates what they're supposed to do in the first place .. but something that gets VMware Fusion sending the right message would be better.\n\nA: To expand on what CajunLuke said about changing the configuration on a per app basis.\nIf you have Logitech Control Center for OS X installed you can use Advanced click settings for just VMFusion using the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*System Settings > Control Center\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click the Plus button next to the global settings drop down and navigate to VMFusion and click select\n\n*Change Thumb Back button to Advanced Click with the button 4 option and Change Tumb Forward button to Advanced Click with the button 5 option.\n\nI use win + left and win + right for screen snapping in windows, so key mapping was not an option for me.  Advanced click allowed me to keep the windows shortcuts intact as well as use my forward and back buttons on my Anywhere Mouse MX as intended. I have tested this in Win8 full screen and single window and it works beautifully.  I'm not sure about unity because I haven't used Win8 in unity mode so I did not test.  Hope this helps others.  I know it took me forever to find the anser I needed.\n\nA: I've fixed this my using Fusion's \"Key Mappings\" feature. CajunLuke is correct: Windows was receiving \"Win+Left\" and \"Win+Right\", I simply re-mapped \"Cmd+Left\" to \"Alt+Left\" and \"Cmd+Right\" to \"Alt+Right\", and Explorer et al. seem to work correctly now.\n\nA: It seems like VMware is sending the buttons to Windows as Win-← and Win-→. Go to VMware's preferences (as opposed to the individual VM's settings) -> Keyboard & Mouse toolbar tab -> Mouse Shortcuts tab. You may be able to modify the settings in there.\nAlternatively, you may be able to change the keypress generated by the mouse button in OS X on a per-app basis and change it to do what you expect when VMware is active.\n\nA: Please note that the solution above - \"If you have Logitech Control Center for OS X installed you can use Advanced click settings for just VMFusion\" - causes 5-10 second hangs with Mac OS X Mavericks + VMWare Fusion 6 when switching between VMFusion (a particular set mouse settings for VMWare Fusion only) and another Mac OS X program (the global set of Logitech mouse for all other programs).  It seems that the problem is the current (latest) version of Logitech Control Center's incompatibility with Mavericks - it worked OK with Mac OS X Mountain Lion (no hangs) but not anymore with Mavericks.\nI got around this by deleting in the Logitech Control Center the VMware Fusion specific settings and using only the global/general settings.  I then used VMware Fusion's \"Key mapping\" function (as mentioned above) to remap the keys and it works fine now.\n(Thanks to VMware support who have been great with looking into the hangs and then it now turns out that the problem is not VMware Fusion but Logitech's software.)\n", "Q: Having trouble with Final Cut Pro disk space When I try to load footage onto final cut pro, it says that i do not have enough disc space. Before I start loading, I have 320 GB of free space.\nIn total, I am trying to load 5 hours of footage. \nWhat can be the problem?\n\nA: .DV tends to be about 4MB/sec. So 5 hours is about 18,000 seconds, so you are looking at a capture of about 72000MB, 72G so you should be fine..\nAre you sure the Capture Scratch disk is set properly? Sometimes it's set to the wrong drive you want to capture to.\nCheck Preferences if you are using FCP, if you are using FCPX it might be somewhere else, not sure how you set capture disks in FCPX..\n\nA: I found that System settings- Minimum allowable free space on scratch disks:\nSet mine to 1000MB and everythng has worked since doing this.\n\nA: Had the same issue, here's how I solved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all Libraries from the file Menu\n\n*Quit FCPX \n\n*Restart the Mac\n\n*Open the Library in Finder by command+click and \"Show Package Content\" \n\n*Manually copy any file into the library (It doesn't matter what you copy, this is just in order to change the size of the package.)\n\n*Open FCPX using Command+Option to reset settings \n\n*try to import something new\n\n\nif it works you can safely remove the files you added in step 5.

Is there any version of the game Civilization that will run reasonably well on a mid-2011 13\" MacBook Air (1.7 gHz core i5; 4GB RAM) that shipped with Lion but now runs Mountain Lion?\nPowerPC software won't run on Lion or Mountain Lion, and the graphics performance might preclude the latest releases, but is there any version modern enough to work with Lion/Mountain Lion but old enough that the graphics on an MBA will handle it?\n\nA: I have the same generation MBA.  You don't specify 11 or 13 inch, and that makes a potential considerable CPU difference, but on my 11\" 1.6Ghz 4Gb RAM Air I have played Civilization V just fine.  Slows down a little as the game progresses, but looks good and plays perfectly acceptably to me.\n\nA: I ran Civ IV & V on a 2008 White MacBook with the old Intel card, so I highly doubt that the latest Air won't be able to handle it. I know on V the diplomacy screens would crash, but I think that was related to the version of the game I had, because it worked fine on my newer machines after an update.\nMy best advise, try. There is no harm in installing it and giving it a shot.\n\nA: Civilization V works great on my MacBook Air. I run full-resolution (1440x900) with graphics set to middling levels.\n\nA: About the graphics of the Macbook Air\nThe Macbook Air mid 2011 has Intel HD 3000 graphics. These are basically the same as  the integrated graphics of the  Macbook Pro models, but run on lower frequencies.\nDue to their low power consumption, the MBA's CPU is referred to as an Ultra Low Voltage processor:\n\n*\n\n*ULV processors core ix-2xx7 with Intel HD 3000 graphics (base freq. 350MHz, turbo 900-1000MHz)\n\nThe same Intel HD 3000 graphics of higher end models run between 650MHz and 1200MHz.\nCivilization 5\nYou can carefully compare benchmarks that have been run on Macbook Pro models using integrated graphics only. But you need to be aware of the resolution used as it can significantly affect the max fps during gameplay.\n\nBenchmarks submitted at Notebookcheck.net (see picture) suggest that Civilization 5 cannot be played. The human eye can distinguish between up to 12 fps - which is lower that what this benchmark shows - but the fps go down during intensive gameplay.\nCivlization 1-4 and Conclusion\n\n*\n\n*We can rule out Civilization 5 and 1, 2 (too old). Which leaves us with Civilization 3 and 4.\n\n\n*Civlization 4 can be played very well on a MBP 2011 with the 2.3 GHz i5 CPU as this video proves.\nCivilization 4 and the less resource demanding version 3 should provide acceptable gameplay.\n\nA: I have the same machine (MBA'11, i5 processor, 4G RAM, 256G SSD) and have played Civ5 too.\nThis game runs well on my Air, but with two points worth notice.\n\n\n*\n\n*Air gets hot quickly, so the fan cries very loudly during the gameplay.\n\n*The delay between rounds is acceptable at the beginning, when using a basic setting. However the delay might be much longer with a larger map, more players, and after many rounds.\n\n\nA: I have a 2010 MacBook Air and it works fine. You have Intel integrated graphics, but the HD 3000 is not like the older Intel graphics, this one is good (it's better than my Nvidia 320M, which is officially supported).\n\nA: The answer is no, according to the System Requirements of Civilization V, IV and III. Intel integrated graphics are not supported across the board according to the system requirements listed on Aspyr's website for the various versions of the game, however they don't say it does not work with your particular version of Intel Ingrated Graphics the \"Intel HD Graphics 3000\" So it may be the case that it might not work well and if there are problems they will not help you directly.

I'm going to get an SSD, making that my boot drive and moving the existing hard drive to the optical drive bay. I will keep my data on the original hard drive.\nMacPerformanceGuide.com says \"If the Boot drive is a fast SSD, moving the home directory can be self-defeating for performance.\"\nLet me be clear. I'm talking about the home directory specifically. MacPerformanceGuide talks about the goodness of moving the Documents, iTunes library, etc. folders, but not so the home folder.\nWhy is that?\nWe are not talking about wearing out the SSD with excessive write cycles; we're talking performance. \n\nA: OS X stores a considerable amount of data, from program caches to a multitude of preferences and other vital tmp files, in your home folder (Library to be precise). Shifting these off the SSD is detrimental. The system would still pull files from your speedy SSD but any cache files from your apps (both third party and default) would be pulled from traditional and cumbersome HDD. \nOffloading large, static files, like music, movies, books, and other documents that benefit little from the speed of an SSD are recommended. But moving small core files that benefit greatly from solid state disks isn't. It's crucial to keep as many integral system components on your SSD as possible. A 2 GB movie or 1,000 songs won't benefit because movies don't need to be played faster and neither do songs. They may load a little quicker, and in the future, when SSDs will have TB of space, this won't be a problem anymore, but for now, it's all about triage.\nI suppose you could try to micromanage this aspect but to be 100% safe, I would just move the big ticket items. An 120 GB SSD with 5 GB on it won't be faster than one with 20 GB on it. \n\nA: Because you will be constantly on the Desktop and Library when you open/close programs..\nIf those are on the regular HD, they will read/write at the regular HD speed.\n\nA: I disagree with the accepted answer in practice.\nIt's clear that if you put some files on slower storage than SSD, you will clearly have slower access times for those files, but for speed in real usage for OS X 10.7 and later - the vast majority of the speed gains come from SSD backing the OS and the applications and the system libraries and caches.\nThe nature of large file serial IO is that when you are reading or writing to movies, videos, photo image files and other items - HDD actually perform quite well and the system knows how to optimize and wait for serial IO to finish without blocking the user. Similarly, read-ahead buffers are great for managing known/predictable access patterns.\nSSD excel in other areas and as long as you don't have a system that's under enormous RAM memory pressure - you can run with all user files on the HDD and the rest of the files on SSD quite happily and realize great speedups over having all files on HDD.\nSome exceptions to the general rule would be Virtual Machine storage - it might be worth copying them from HDD to SSD if you have room to run a VM out of the SSD.\nI have some systems where there are almost a TB of VM images total, but I only need 100 GB of VM running at any one time and will move the images to SSD before starting the hypervisor software when the performance benefit for that use merits me caring about where specific files are stored.\n\nA: In general, having your data split among multiple drives will always improve performance. In an ideal world, every single file on your system would be on it's own hard drive with it's own drive cache/etc.\nBut only if the other drive is at least as fast as the one you remove it from. If you replace an internal drive with a USB or even thunderbolt drive, then performance will probably be reduced.\nIf your internal boot drive is a high end SSD and you move your home directory to a $3 USB memory stick, then performance is going to be crap. On the other hand, if you move your home directory to a second internal SSD, then you will improve performance in many situations.\nFor something in between those two, you'll have to use your own judgement and/or test it out. The answer is going to depend on exactly what you use your hard drive for. Without knowing exactly how fast your SSD and existing hard drives are, or how you use your system, it's hard to predict what will be the best solution.\n", "Q: When I open Terminal, I get an \"I have no name!\" prompt Suddenly, this morning, I open a Terminal window and I get this:\nI have no name!@macbook:~$ whoami\n502\n\n** I am not a number!

Anyone know what I need to do to get my name back?  \nI suppose there are two problems here, one is that my hostname is undefined, the other is that whoami reports my name as a number.  \n\nA: Something in memory got corrupted, and the mapping between your userID (502) and your username (ipd) was lost.  I've seen it happen (usually when I've manually killed hung system processes), although I'm not sure exactly what causes it.  launchd maybe?\nBecause that mapping is lost, whoami can't convert your ID into a username so returns the ID, and your prompt defaults to the \"I have no name!\" message because you effectively don't have a name.\nLogging out and back in might fixit, but restarting is the best way (as you discovered).\nBasically, it's a symptom of another problem, and not a problem in and of itself.\n\nA: This happens to me randomly when I resume from standby (i.e. opening my laptop).

According to Marc Booth, Apple changed the polarity of the magnets sometime in 2011, because \"some iPad 2 customers were having issues with their iPads entering sleep mode when they flipped Apple's Smart Cover around flat behind their iPad 2\". Marc also reports that \"Apple is replacing older Apple Smart Covers at Apple Stores for customers who ask.\" \n\nA: Yes.\n\nThe iPad Smart Cover is compatible with iPad 2 or later.\n\n\nA: That it will. There is no change to the smart cover range. \n(See here:- the product number is the same as the one I have, and it says compatible with both.\n\nA: It could depend on magnet polarity.\n\nReports on the Apple support forums say that the company will exchange\n  defective covers for new ones at the Apple store, and third-party\n  manufacturers including Targus and Maroo are also offering\n  replacements.\n\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2012/3/22/2893087/new-ipad-smart-cover-incompatibility-magnet-polarity\n", "Q: How can I put my music on dropbox without moving the iTunes folder I want to copy just my music (not films/tv/etc, so I cant just move the iTunes folder) on to dropbox, so I can listen to it from anywhere for free, but without copying the music as my hard drive space is becoming limited and I don't want to have to recopy everything, everytime I add a new track).\nIs there anyway to make Dropbox include the music folder inside the Dropbox folder? If you create a shortcut in the dropbox folder it will just sync the shortcut itself, can I make the shortcut actually be the music folder?\n\nA: The easiest way to this would be to simply create a folder in DropBox and then create a Symbolic Link to your Music only folder in iTunes.\nThere is a useful article on symlinks available here. Another one specific to DropBox is available here.\nIn example you could create a symbolic link to a folder named Music in DropBox as follows:\n\nln -s ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Music ~/DropBox/Music\n\n\nA: Why not physically move the folder in Finder into your dropbox (so instead of Music > iTunes Music you have Dropbox > iTunes Music) and then change the directory of your library (through iTunes > Preferences) to be in the right place? \nNo duplicates, music synced, all happy?\n", "Q: In itunes (for windows) can you set podcast location on disk to a different location? In itunes (latest for for windows) can you set podcast download location on disk to a different location that just the media folder set in preferences?\n\nA: Unfortunately, not really.  While you can specify the location of the entire iTunes Library folder (in Preferences, to to Advanced, and change the iTunes Media location), you can't set a different directory for specific types of media, such as podcasts.  \n", "Q: Are the new iPads (iPad 3) for sale in the US unlocked for the UK? I live and work in the UK, but I am in the US for 2 weeks, and was wondering if I buy the new iPad from the Apple Store here in the States, will I be able to replace the AT&T or Verizon SIM with an O2 or T-mobile (UK mobile carriers) SIM? Or are the iPads sold by the Apple Store locked to US based carriers?\n\nA: If you bought the device without a contract, it's unlocked!\nThe information about AT&T and Verizon is important when talking about LTE availability in the US. Only AT&T and Verizon provide LTE networks in the US that work with the iPad.\n\n4G LTE is supported only on AT&T and Verizon networks in the U.S. and on Bell, Rogers, and Telus networks in Canada. footnote no.3 - iPad specs\n\nThis is important to note as LTE frequency bands used in Europe, Australia and probably most of Asia are not supported by the iPad. You will use DC-HSDPA, HSPA+ or UMTS instead for fast internet access.\n\nA: Yes the iPads are unlocked with respect to international (non US sim cards) so you are not tied to a contract and free to use whatever carrier you choose internationally. \n\nIt's not clear why Apple is mentioning that UK iPads will work only with AT&T LTE here. The 3G networks between VZW and AT&T are even less compatible than their LTE implementations, but if you went with the AT&T model here, I would be extremely surprised if it's not identical to the ones sold in the UK with exception of the initial carrier settings loaded on the device (and that it will always be known to Apple as an AT&T iPad.)\nYou can see that the iPads sold in the UK explicitly call out that they will work with AT&T's LTE only and not with Verizon's LTE. \nThis could simply be a agreement or modem driver delivery choice rather than something physically different with the models. Again, until someone tears apart the various models and posts the differences, we can only go on the Apple marketing information calling out which carriers work with which other ones across the pond. I could see the verizon one being special to take better advantage of verizon's 3G (and slower) network footprint here in the US so you might avoid that one until more is known for sure.\nAgain, those of us buying the Verizon iPad should get coverage in europe, but perhaps not as good as the AT&T or the UK specific models.\n\nA: I visited the UK from the US with a new iPad 3 which had an ATT sim card.\nUpon arrival I purchased My 3 sim card from the Apple store in Lincoln (UK)and replaced the ATT card. It only cost 10 pounds for 1Gb of use for 1 month, ample for my 3 week visit.\nI have had no problem connecting all over the UK  and would highly recommend the My 3 sim card which was 25% of the cost of ATT in the US for one month's\ncontract service ($15 for 250Mb per month)\n\nA: The disclaimers on the Apple site (both the US and UK Apple websites) indicate the following:\n\nThe iPad with Wi-Fi + 4G model you purchase is configured to work with a particular cellular network technology. Check with your carrier for compatibility and cellular data plan availability.\n\nand\n\n4G LTE is supported only on AT&T and Verizon networks in the U.S. and on Bell, Rogers, and Telus networks in Canada. See your carrier for details.\n\nGiven that Apple keeps concluding with this recommendation, I would suggest that the safest answer is to check with your carrier in the U.K. whether an iPad from the United States would work with one of their SIMs. The documentation specifically states that 4G LTE will not work outside the specified carriers in the U.S. and Canada, but U.K. carriers do sell plans for the iPad (3rd generation).\n\nA: Taken directly from the Apple site:\n\nBoth the ATT and Verizon model of iPad can roam worldwide on GSM/UMTS networks. In countries without compatible 4G LTE networks, the new iPad will operate on GSM network technologies such as HSPA+ and DC-HSDPA. When you travel internationally, you can use a micro-SIM card from a local carrier.\n\nThis means the new iPad (3) is unlocked at time of purchase.  No further work necessary, I assume. This also means that you can buy the new iPad (3) from anywhere and it will work anywhere.  The fact that your carrier said it be better to buy in the UK is simply because they hope you'll buy it from them.  It does not matter where you buy it.\n\nA: I bought my iPad 2 in the States (it is an AT&T model) and I've been using it in England since last June. Works fine on Vodafone UK. But as a thought, after paying sales tax in the US, you don't save terribly much over buying the device in the UK. The days of bargain American pricing have gone, Apple seems much more reasonable about currency differences now. \nOf course, if you purchase in a no sales tax state like New Hampsire you can avoid all taxes.\n\nA: All cellular capable iPads are unlocked regardless of the carrier. See this answer on Apple's Forums.\n", "Q: MacBook as WiFi extender With AirDrop it seems that my MacBook Pro can have multiple Wifi Connections, so can I connect my iPhone to my Macbook at the same time as the macbook is connected to a Time Capsule's Wifi network.\nI have both 5GHz and 2.4GHz Wifi in my house, and the 2.4GHz only just reaches my room, whereas the 5GHz signal is much better. Sometimes my iPhone cant connect to the 2.4GHz network without moving closer to the base station.\nIs it possible to use my MacBook as an extender, so that my phone can connect to the Macbook and then use it's 5GHz connection, and it won't drop out and become unconnectable?\n\nA: According to Dori's answer in this Apple.SE thread, what you're looking for is not possible:\n\nIn order for a Mac to create a local Wi-Fi network, it needs to have a\n  wired Internet source.\n\nMore information can be found in this Apple Support KB:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences and click Sharing.\n  \n*Select Internet Sharing and click the checkbox if it isn’t checked.\n  \n*Choose the Internet connection you want to share from the “Share your connection from” pop-up menu. For example, if you’re connected to\n  the Internet over Ethernet, choose Ethernet.\n  \n*Select how you want to share your Internet connection in the “To computers using” list. For example, if you want to share your Internet\n  connection over AirPort, select AirPort. If you share your Internet\n  connection using AirPort, click AirPort Options and give your network\n  a name and password.\n  \n\nYou'd need to hook your MacBook up to a wired connection before you can share Wi-Fi via Internet Sharing.\n\nA: To realize this little project you need to understand that to \"share\" a connection you need another connection.\nIn other words you'd need a wifi to connect to your router's lan and a wifi that has to be turned in an access point.\nIf you get the chance to use a wifi usb card you can try this :)\n(or, as the other user suggest, a mixed solution without buying anything would be to use your mac's ethernet and wifi for the same purpouse)\n\nA: I know this has already been answered and a correct answer chosen, however...\nFor fun, if you had two laptops, you could indeed couple them together and use one as an extender:\nBasics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Laptop A (connection source)\n\n*Laptop B (extender)\n\n\nSteps to \"wirelessly\" extend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect laptop A to your wifi connection.\n\n*Share laptop A's wifi connection over its ethernet port.\n\n*Connect laptop A and laptop B via ethernet cable.\n\n*Share laptop B's ethernet connection over the wifi connection.\n\n*Connect misc devices to laptop B's wifi hotspot.\n\n\nI know it kind of defeats the purpose, but if you've got two laptops laying around...\nAlso, I believe (and please anyone correct me if I am wrong) that the reason you can't share internet via the single wireless adapter is because you cannot share (or bridge) a wifi internet connection with an adhoc connection on the same chip. The bridge can only be made across discrete devices, so if you had another wifi adapter, as another answerer mentioned, you could share the connection from one to the other.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S won't sync with iTunes My iPhone 4S doesn't show in the left column in iTunes. I'm running iTunes 10.6.\nAny ideas on how to troubleshoot this?\n\nA: 1 - Restart.\n2 - Hard reset (home and power buttons).\n3 - If you have it, the XCode device manager sometimes detects devices that iTunes does not.\nOne of those three should solve the problem entirely, and if not - jailbroken? also any error messages?\n", "Q: Format SD card with FAT and custom file allocation unit size I'm using Maverick (a offline mapping application) on my Android device which has thousands of files in the tile cache with a size of 168 byte. The SD card is formatted with a file allocation unit size of 32 KB. This results for each file in a huge waste of space:\n168 Byte (33 KB on the volume)\n\nYou can imagine that a 2GB is full even if you want to store 50MB of real data. Is there software I can use on my Mac to change the file allocation unit size during formatting of the device?\n\nA: Open up a terminal and check out the following command:\nNAME\n     newfs_msdos -- construct a new MS-DOS (FAT) file system\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     newfs_msdos [-N] [-B boot] [-F FAT-type] [-I volid] [-O OEM]\n                 [-S sector-size] [-a FAT-size] [-b block-size]\n                 [-c cluster-size] [-e dirents] [-f format] [-h heads]\n                 [-i info] [-k backup] [-m media] [-n FATs] [-o hidden]\n                 [-r reserved] [-s total] [-u track-size] [-v volume-name]\n                 special [disktype]\n\nIn particular these parameters:\n -S sector-size\n         Number of bytes per sector.

There is this Apple page iPad (3rd generation): Using Dictation, that has a very short \"Dictation tips\" section, but it currently only covers selection of different languages.\nIs there any way to have control over the vocabulary, or spelling, of the Dictation feature?\n\nA: I found the answer from iMore's How to turn on and use Siri-like Dictation on your new iPad:\n\nIf Dictation gets confused about any of the words you speak, it will underline them in blue on the screen. If the word is incorrect, tap it to get a popup menu with alternatives. Tap an alternative to switch to it. You can also simply edit voice dictation text like any other text.\n\nSure enough, single-tapping on Claire gives me an option to change the text to Clare, and of course it works other ambiguous words. \nA particularly useful example is when you mean Buy, and the dictation types By, with a blue underline. Tapping on that gives the two alternatives Buy and Bye.\n", "Q: All Music Off iPhone I have an iPhone 4S, and I recently upgraded to Spotify Premium (it's awesome) and want to clear all the music off my iPhone (through the normal iPod app). \nThing is, I use iTunes Match so plugging into iTunes won't let me wipe it all out - and there are a lot of artists that I want to delete - it would take a long time. \nIs there any way to expedite the process?\n\nA: This isn't through the iPod app, but it (should) delete all the music from your device.\nSettings > General > Usage > Music > Edit (button, upper right hand corner) > \"-\" button > Delete.\n", "Q: Removing coloured icons in Finder There have been a number of questions for removing the muted sidebar icons and replacing them with the older coloured versions.  It's well documented that the coloured versions still happily exist and can be seen by simply looking in the Go menu of the finder app.\nI want to do it the other way around.  I want to find instances of the coloured icons, and replace those with the muted versions instead.  The most obvious place for them to appear is in the header bar of finder windows, but there is the aforementioned go menu too.\n\nHow can I make all instance of a coloured finder icons for default home folder locations use the muted monochrome versions as seen in the sidebar by default?\n\nA: If you use CandyBar, you can change the icons for system folders. Selecting a monochrome set of icons will make all the finder icons monochrome. Note that you cannot change the icons for applications from the App store without breaking their code signature, and thus their ability to update.\nYou can find the sidebar icons and most of the other icons to which you refer in the folder /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources\nIf one doesn't mind mucking about in system folders (something one should do with a great deal of caution), one might duplicate some of the Sidebar* icons and use them to replace the corresponding icons without the word Sidebar before them. I wouldn't try this without a bootable backup in place, however, in case I messed something up badly.\n", "Q: Modifying behaviour of \"Stationery Pad\" function in Finder I recently found out about the \"Stationery Pad\" feature of the Finder in OS X. For those who are not familiar with it, it allows you to select a file (usually a document of some sort) and in the Get Info window tick the Stationery Pad button. This allows you to use the file as a template for future files which will be based on this one.\nIn essence when you have a file that is marked in this way, when you double click the file instead of opening it it will create a copy of the file, called your-original-filename copy and then immediately save it in the same folder as the template file you double clicked on.\nThis is incredibly useful, but has a couple of annoying features:\n\n\n*\n\n*It puts the copy file in the same location\n\n*It immediately saves the file with a name that you are guaranteed to want to change\n\n\nIs there any known way to make it open a copy of the file, that does not immediately save it? This will allow me to a) choose my own name without having to subsequently remove the \"copy\" version, and b) have it in the location of my choice from the start. In effect, I'd like to open it as if it was a brand new file that has no name and has never been saved.\nFrankly, at the moment it's quicker to copy and paste a file somewhere else then edit it than use this feature, at the expense of the original file not being 'protected' against edits (which is the best part of it, as the amount of times I create letterheads, etc. for people who then save their first letter over the top of the template file…).\n\nA: If, instead of marking the file as a stationary pad, you just lock it, most software will open it read-only, and you can just do a save-as, accomplishing exactly what you want (An open file that is a duplicate of the locked file and hasn't yet been saved.) The file will be write-protected.\nUnfortunately, the stationary pad feature is designed the way it is and (as far as I know) there isn't a workaround to change that. Most word processing and other software already has a built-in template feature, so that's worth looking into, as well.\n", "Q: How do I assign a keyboard shortcut to a service in OS X?

I'm upgrading from the original iPad (2010) to the new iPad (2012).  I skipped the iPad 2 and the Smart Cover, so I don't have any compatible cover accessory for the new iPad.\nI did try someone else's iPad 2 and Smart Cover before, and while I think the Smart Cover design is clever, it does little to protect the iPad from a fall, or the back from scratches.  And, while the magnets are strong, the Smart Cover can still separate; i.e. don't have a 4-year-old yank an iPad 2 by the Smart Cover and expect it to stay stuck!\nWhat I would really like to shield my new iPad is something almost (but not quite) exactly like the cover I had for my original.  Of course I'm referring to this:\n       \nWhat I liked about the original black iPad case/cover is:\n\n\n*\n\n*it protected both front and back from scratches,\n\n*it could be folded to stand in two orientations,\n\n*the rubber-like material sticking out a bit at the edges made the case absorb some of the shock of a side-impact drop (helpful if you have a four-year-old .. though she's five now and is more careful!),\n\n*it is tight fitting, and\n\n*it could be cleaned easily.\n\n\nI already tried putting my new iPad into the old iPad case/cover, and some things don't line up (power button, notably), and it's lacking the camera hole at the back, and it's no longer a tight fit since the new iPad is slimmer.\nIs there a third-party / aftermarket case almost exactly like the Apple one pictured above, but designed for the new iPad (2012)? I'm hoping some company might have closely matched Apple's original design.\n\nA: Targus is advertising iPad 3 cases and one of their portfolio style cases may suit you. \nMany iPad 2 cases will work with the new model.

(This is likely because many of these accessories were designed to fit both the iPad 2 and the original iPad, and the original iPad is even thicker than the new model.)\nSimilarly, most iPad stands and mounts—especially those that hold the iPad loosely in a groove, slot, or cradle, or on easel-style supports—work perfectly with the iPad. Even Twelve South's HoverBar, which uses a rigid-plastic, corner-hugging cradle, fits the new iPad, albeit with a tighter fit than when mounting an iPad 2.\n\nEven better, Apple's site now states that the MC360ZM/A dock lists compatibility with the iPad 1st generation and the MC940ZM/A dock with the iPad 2 2nd generation and iPad 3rd generation.\n\n", "Q: How do I import files into GarageBand on iPod touch? I'm trying to import the m4a files that iTunes synchronized from the Voice Memo app, but the files are not showing up in the GarageBand app in iOS when I open it.\nAny idea how to import these sound files?\n\nA: To import audio files into Garageband for iOS, connect your iOS device to your computer. Then do the following:\nOn your computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Click your device in the left-hand column\n\n*Click \"Apps\" in the bar at the top of the right-hand pane\n\n*Under \"File Sharing\" select \"Garageband\" in the \"Apps\" column\n\n*Click \"Add...\" in the bottom-right of the \"GarageBand Documents\" area\n\n*In the dialog that opens up, select the file(s) you want to transfer over\n\n*Once you've selected the file(s), it transfers over to your iOS device.\n\nOn your iOS device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open GarageBand\n\n*If you're not already, switch to the multi-track view by tapping the  button\n\n*In the upper right-hand area, you should see a loop icon with the number of newly transferred files on top of it, like this:\n\n\n*Tap this icon. It brings up a screen like this:\n\n\n*Just like the screen says, you can tap and hold and drag the desired audio files into your track listings. They each appear as Audio Recorder tracks:\n\nThat's it!\nThere is one caveat: GarageBand for iOS is limited to a maximum of 320 \"bars\" for the length of a project, and it does not appear that it's possible to bypass this. If you need to edit audio that's longer than that, you will need to use another app.\n", "Q: WiFi Problems on iTouch 2nd Gen Basically, it's still in great condition, and is a 32gb ipod. Everything works, except that the wifi is grayed out and doesn't work, at all, ever. Is there any way to fix this? I read somewhere that it was because it has iOS 5 on it, which doesn't like 2nd gen ipods. Would anyone know if this is possible to fix in any way, such as downgrading the OS or an even newer update?\nALSO: How hard is it to replace the volume buttons? Mine don't work 100% of the time, particularly the up one\n\nA: This is relatively common for that generation (and 3rd generation). Typically, when the Wi-Fi goes out, the bluetooth will as well since they're on the same chip. Is that grayed out as well? If not, it can still be the Wi-Fi chip. \nThere's not really an easy fix for it. It's definitely going to be a swap out, especially with your volume button issue. You can take your iPod to the Apple Store and they'll give you a quote on a replacement. It'll probably be around $99. \nSomething else you could try is restoring your iPod Touch in iTunes. Make sure you set it up as a new device.\n", "Q: Is there a tool or an app to automatically sort home screen icons? Is there any way to automatically sort all apps across all screens?\n\nA: There is a way! If you go to your Settings > General > Reset, there is an option to reset the home screen layout. Pick that option and all your apps will be rearranged in alphabetical order. But you'll lose all your folders and maps...\n\nA: No. Apps are extremely limited when it comes to modifying anything outside their sandbox. You might find an app capable of sorting the icons if your device is jail broken. But there definitely isn't one available on the app store. \n\nA: Tongbu can do this.\nIt has a feature called \"Smart Icons\" in its icon manager.\nIt's actually very extensive the options it gives you. You can even chose to ignore existing folders as well as the first, second and third homescreens.\nEven select what categories you want it to use.\nI just use it in Sandboxie along with the Run as admin option (which is in sandboxies window). Everything works fine with no ill effects.\nThis works in all versions of iOS except for 9 as far as I know.\nPart of the app is in Chinese and i think there is only a windows version but im not sure.\n", "Q: Do I have to authorize purchased iOS apps to run on iOS devices? I can't seem to find a straight answer to this.\nDo I have to authorize iOS apps I have purchased on my iOS devices to run on other iOS Devices? For example I have an app that I bought on my iPhone - can I sign into my friends iPad, re-download it, and then sign out (of the iTunes store) and use and update the perfectly? Or do I have to authorize it in some way?\n\nA: Apple has worked hard to try to avoid the situation you mentioned. It is a major pain to have apps downloaded from different Apple IDs on one iOS device. For example, someone bought an app for me, but used (obviously) their Apple ID. Anytime I wanted to update that app, they had to enter their Apple ID in. That also meant that clicking \"Update all\" in the app store didn't really work. I finally got frustrated and bought the app myself.\nSo the short answer to both of your questions is basically yes. You can download it for a friend, but, anytime they update, you must autenticate for that app. Everything else should work normally.\nYou mentioned iPhone vs. iPad - as I'm sure you're already aware of, note that the app must be compatible for iPhone and iPad for what you mentioned to work.\n", "Q: How can I move Contacts from Exchange to the From My Mac groups? I have discovered that some personal contacts that I'd created (using the iPhone's built-in Contacts app) were created in the Exchange (business) group.  How can I move them over to the \"From My Mac\" contacts?  (Preferably into one of the Address Book Groups that I've created there.)  \nAnd how can I prevent this from happening in the future (perhaps by specifying which group to use when creating a contact)?\nI have an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1.  Jail-breaking is not an option.  The iPhone syncs to iTunes on a Macbook Air running OS X 10.5.8.\n\nA: Unfortunately, iPhone Groups are not meant to be edited from within the iPhone Contacts app. You can try copy iPhone contacts from one group to the next using a third-party program designed to access your iPhone Contacts app from a PC.\n\nA: If you're syncing with you Mac, just open up your Address Book app, and drag them wherever you want to put them.\n\nA: To ensure that any new Contacts I created went into the \"From My Mac\" group, I changed the \"Default Account\" for Contacts [in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars] from \"Exchange\" to \"From My Mac\". \nThere is no functionality to manage Contact Group membership on the iPhone in iOS 5.1.  \nTo move the Contacts from Outlook to \"From My Mac\", I found those contacts in Outlook (on my PC), and emailed a Vcard / .vcf file (In Outlook, right-click the Contact, choose \"Foward Contact\", then choose \"As a Business Card\") to my personal email address.  I then opened those Vcards on the iPhone through Mail, and saved as new Contacts.  (They went to the correct group because I'd made change in Settings, above.)  Last, I deleted those contacts from Outlook, so that they wouldn't be dupes.  \nSee also How do I move a contact on the iPhone from one group to another?.  \n\nA: The only way to manage groups on the iPhone is though the iCloud web interface.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to www.icloud.com and sign in\n\n*Click the Contacts icon\n\n*Click the red icon with two people toward the top\n\n*Click and drag contacts into different groups as desired\n\n*When you're done, click the gear icon at the bottom\n\n*Click Refresh Contacts\n\n*In the Contacts app (on iPhone), go to the Groups screen and click the reload button.\n\n", "Q: What apps are people using to record voice meetings on the iPad? I'm looking to do some light recording of voice conversations and field recordings on my iPad using the built in microphone. \nGarageBand seems to be the obvious Apple solution, but is too heavy for my needs. By the time I set up a new project, turn off the metronome, etc..., I find myself wishing I just had Voice Memos running on my iPad. \nI don't mind paying for the app, but wondered what people are using for both light voice recording as well as longer and more numerous recording / light editing where some tagging and filing might be possible.\n\nA: My favorite app is the Voice memos for iPad. It only $0.99 and it supports multitasking!\nAnd if you like free apps, I would recommand using Audio memos free Voice Recorder.\n\nA: I use Griffin's iTalk Premium which costs $2 on the US store.\n\nA: A different approach is to use an app like Notability or Evernote which not only can record notes, but also integrate with other note taking tools.\nEvernote is strong for tagging notes with location and time of capture. Notability is stronger since it allows you to draw notes, sketches or type notes while recording.  Once the session is over, you can tap on your notes to queue the sound to the time when you wrote that specific note. \nIt's got reasonably good options for audio recording, but no audio editing features -- but if the combination of note-taking and audio notes appeals, it's pretty ideal.\nIf you just need a simple - fast - press one button and go app - try out Just Press Record. It's snappy and works from the Apple Watch to the iPad Pro.\n\nA: With iOS 12 Voice Memos is finally available for the iPad. It should be pre-installed but the App Store link is here.\n", "Q: How can I assign a custom icon from a graphic file to another file in Lion? Suppose I have a graphic file (a .png, for instance), and I want to make that graphic the icon for another file or folder. Previously, I would copy the image to the clipboard (either in Preview, like in the instructions in this post or in the Get Info window in the Finder), then open the Get Info window for the target file, select the icon, and paste the image in as the new icon. In the past, this has worked for me.\nWhen I do this in Lion, the result is that the target file now has the default .png icon (document with folded corner, blue-ish image in the middle, and the letters \"PNG\"), rather than the particular .png image I intended to paste. If the image I am pasting is a .pdf, I get the same results, except that the resulting target file icon has the letters \"PDF\".\nIs there another way that I can assign a custom icon from a graphic file to another file in Lion, because I'm still unable to do it?\n\nA: When Preview fails, I turn to the Web Browser, master of all filetypes.\nOpen the image in Safari, Chrome, or Firefox by dragging it to the app's icon or using\nFile-> Open.\nRight click on the image and choose Copy Image (be careful not to use Copy Image URL or Copy Image Location).\nFrom there, use the standard procedure of pasting into the Get Info window.\nIf the image you want to use is a PDF, you'll need to create a rasterized version that you can copy from the web browser. You can still use Preview for this: open the PDF, choose File-> Export and set the format to PNG. You can open the exported version and copy that.\n\nA: something similar was asked before:\nChange OSX Folder Icons (Working on OSX Lion)\na more verbose instruction is here:\nhttp://www.mac-software-tutorials.com/mac-icons.html\nbasically, once you have opened the image you want to use in Preview, First you CMD-a, THEN you CMD-c to copy it, then you paste it over the old icon (that you get with the 'get info' trick).\n", "Q: Can't sync smart playlists that contains podcasts I have a smart playlist that pulls the latest podcasts, however when I try to sync the playlist to my Shuffle 4th gen, nothing happens. Smart playlists with \"normal\" audio files, syncs fine.\nAnyone know how to troubleshoot this?\n\nA: If the playlist sync over but the podcasts fail to play, it could be that you have your iPod shuffle set to \"shuffle songs\". You must switch to \"play in order\" for it to work.\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nPlaying Audiobooks and Podcasts on iPod shuffle\nWhen using iPod shuffle (1st and 2nd generation), if iPod shuffle is set to shuffle songs  it will play all the audio files on iPod shuffle except audiobooks and podcasts. To play an audiobook or podcast, set the switch on iPod shuffle to play in order .\nWhen using iPod shuffle (3rd generation), podcasts and audiobooks will not be played when content is played from All Songs. If content is played from a playlist synced from iTunes, audiobooks and podcasts will only be played if the iPod's switch is set to play in order . In addition to playlists synced from iTunes, iPod shuffle (3rd generation) will create a special playlist for each audiobook synced and one for podcasts. When accessing these special playlists, audiobook and podcast content will play whether the iPod is set to play in order  or shuffle songs . Podcast are sorted by alphabetical order and then by episode date.\n\n", "Q: Many apps missing after restoring iPad backup to migrate to iPad 2 Needing to migrate an original iPad user to an iPad 2, I used the backup and restore mechanism in iTunes (on a PC)\nHowever, the following steps resulted in many of the apps being missing on the destination device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backed up an original iPad to iTunes on a PC\n\n*Factory-reset an iPad 2\n\n*Connected the iPad 2 to the same PC, and restored from backup\n\n\nSome time later, the iPad 2 claimed to be set up, but many of the apps were missing. Instead of there being 3 screen-fulls of apps on the restored device, there was only one, and this was mostly the original Apple apps.\niTunes didn't report any errors throughout this process.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: The original iPad was on iOS 5.0, and the destination was iOS 5.1.\nI ended up having to upgrade the original iPad to iOS 5.1, and then repeating the whole backup & restore operation. \nAfter this, all the expected apps were present on the destination device.\n", "Q: Delete things from $PATH I fiddled with my $PATH and now it's not working correctly anymore. So I thought, well, just remove the last things I added. However, I can't seem to figure out how. \nI added things like so\nexport MAGICK_HOME=\"/Library/ImageMagick-6.7.5/\"\nexport PATH=\"$MAGICK_HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nexport DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$MAGICK_HOME/lib/\"\n\nI do not have the files ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile or /etc/environment. I can't find the mentioned strings in /etc/path or /etc/bashrc. I don't know a command except export, that manipulates the $PATH. \nHow do I get rid of these strings? (And, if it's obvious to you, what did I mess up?)\n\nA: If you just typed in the  exports into the terminal as noted above then the variables in the environment will only last until you exit that terminal session. So simply typing exit and then reopening another terminal will remove any setting that you applied with the noted exports performed in your question.\nexport MAGICK_HOME=\"/Library/ImageMagick-6.7.5/\"\nexport PATH=\"$MAGICK_HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nexport DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$MAGICK_HOME/lib/\"\n\nAdditionally you can un set variables from the environment by using the unset command.\nFor example:\nunset MAGICK_HOME # will remove MAGICK_HOME from the environment. \n\nYou can do it for the others as well but if you do it for PATH you will lose your path setting until you close this terminal session and reopen a new window,etc.\nAs an experiment try typing:  \nenv | grep MAGICK_HOME\n\nYou should see MAGICK_HOME=/Library/ImageMagick-6.7.5/ echoed back if its still in the environment. If its not then the settings have already been lost by a windows close. etc re-enter your export of MAGICK_HOME and try the above command again.\nthen \nexit\n\nand then finally re open a new terminal window and enter:\nenv | grep MAGICK_HOME \n\nYour settings should be gone for MAGICK_HOME. The same is true for the modification done to all the other environment variables set with the export command right in a terminal session. They will just return to their default values if you have not set them in a start-up invocation file as required for your shell environment variables to have a more permanent place in your shell enviorment.\n\nA: To remove a path element in a running shell you can run the following script:\nx=\nfor p in $(echo -e ${PATH//:/\\\\n}); do\n    if [[ $p != /PATH/TO/REMOVE ]]; then\n        x=${x:+$x:}$p\n    fi\ndone\nPATH=$x\n\nreplacing /PATH/TO/REMOVE with the PATH you want to remove.\n\nA: Have a look in /etc/paths.d. Since Snow Leopard the 'preferred' way of adding stuff to your shell path is to add a nice little text file in /etc/paths.d.\nFor instance, I have MacGPG2 installed, and lo and behold:\n$>ls /etc/paths.d\n50-X11  MacGPG2  TeX  TeXbin  git\n\n$>cat MacGPG2 \n/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin\n\n$>echo $PATH\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/texbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin\n\nRemoving the text files from /etc/paths.d seems to be the first port of call to remove stuff from the $PATH \n", "Q: Mac OS X - How to Symlink /home to /Users For those of us who dabble in penguins and apples, it seems very worth while to be able to use /home paths either out of habbit or for those odd cases where the value may have been sync'd somewhere along the line in some file you use on both machines.\n\nA: I regret this answer is not exactly authoritative, since I've never actually done this myself--though I have used a similar automounter on other Unix systems--but here's my understanding as to what /home is used for on OS X.\nSo, let's follow the trail:\nIf you first type mount in Terminal to show active mounts, you'll see this line:\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\n\nautofs maps are defined in /etc/auto_master, and /home is in turn defined specifically in /etc/auto_home.  If you take a look at /etc/auto_home, you'll see this line:\n+/usr/libexec/od_user_homes\n\nFollow the trail one more step to the od_user_homes man page, and you'll find a program whose purpose is to take a username, look it up in Open Directory, and return a URL to that user's home directory.  If you read up on auto_master at its man page, you'll find that using an executable program for a map results in that program being called to look up a URL to mount, which is in turn mounted in-place.\nThe intended application appears to be that, if your Mac is connected to a directory service, going to /home/jdoe will cause the automounter to mount jdoe's home directory there.\nBased on this, it seems logical to conclude that if you don't intend to connect your Mac to a directory service, you're probably okay removing the /home auto-mount as detailed in this comment.  I don't know how future OS updates will deal with this, though.\n\nA: sudo ln -s /Users /home will work with additional configuration, but I don't think that is a good idea as you should access home via ~ in shell or $HOME. Also /home might be a Linux standard and often used in Unix but not always so better to rely on information that is guaranteed to work not something that works only most of the time if everyone has kept to a convention.\nTo make sudo ln -s /Users /home work, follow these steps (from the comments):\nEDITOR=nano sudo -e /etc/auto_master\n# add a \"#\" at the start of the line beginning with /home\n# save changes\nsudo automount -cv\nsudo ln -s /Users /home\n\n\nA: There's no use for /home. OS X, like various other Unix versions, has a unique location for the user. In Linux it's at /home/user, and in OS X it's at /Users. This is why it is good practice to use the shorthand \"~\" or the environment variable $HOME.\nWhile you can create a symlink to the user's base/home directory /Users/[username] using the following command:\nln -s ~ /foo\n\nIt will not work to create a link named /home as there is already a(n unused) directory with that name at the root of the system.\n\nA: I tried this before and got it working for about a week until I rebooted...\nYou can't just symlink /home to /Users. In fact, you can't even remove /home.\nIf you manage to remove /home, it will reappear after you reboot.\nIf you move /home to /home.old, and symlink /home, it will remove the symlink /home.\nYou can have this working for as long as your mac does not crash or reboot.\nWhen you reboot, it all vanishes!\nWhen you reboot, Mac OS X seems to think that you are creating a new user, so it will overwrite all of your user preferences in your old /Users/username directory.\nSince you copied everything to /home/username, you expect to see your new home directory when doing ls /home after you reboot.\nInstead, you get NOTHING!!! It is as if it never existed.\nIn my case, I was freaking out for about 30 minutes, then I booted into single user mode to see if something could be done. I was thinking that I might be able to grab a log file or try to start a repair utility.\nIn single user mode, my home directory was there. Apple intentionally hides any newly created directories under /home from the user when in multiuser mode. This is an intentionally evil design feature.\nApple is lame and discourages any and all kinds of hacking their OS. What kind of a design feature is that? Apple hides the contents of the newly created /home directory. There is absolutely no legitimate reason for Apple to auto-remove the /home directory...or any user-created directories at all!\nIn this case, they are mounting a directory over your /home directory...effectively hiding it.\nIf you are really determined to use /home instead of /Users, you might be able to get around it by writing a script to set everything up upon every boot.\nAlso, I should mention that you should be able to use some other directory that is not /home as a replacement for /Users because only /home is banned.\nIf you use bash, then you will have to set some of the environment variables... namely: CD_HOME and HOME.\nI wish to add that...although you cannot unmount or force unmount /home, you can mount a disk on top of /home. All of this mounted on top of \"auto_home\".\nI was able to mount the recovery disk on top of /home successfully...perhaps this is how it can be done.\n\nA: I don't see any reason at all not to rename the directory /home (in case I'm wrong) and creating a symbolic link from /home to /Users (or, as in my machine, /Volumes/Users since my system disk is for system, dammit!) \nI used to work as a sysadmin, in a university department with 11 flavours of unix.  We had all sorts of symlinks in the global directory tree so that the file system would do the right thing, and scripts came as close as possible to working everywhere.  You do run into a few gotchas, but if your fingers are used to typing /home/foo and a symlink postpones job retraining for your fingers, go ahead.\nSimilarly some linuxen will have home directories as /usr/home already. \nOne place I worked had home directories of /Users/{group}/{username} as a partial protection against students groveling around professors' files if the prof was careless with his permissions.  The Users directory had execute but no read bits set, and the group directories were readable only to the group members.\n(All this in illustration there being many ways to deprive this particular feline of his pelt.)\nOne possible gotcha -- check that time machine doesn't end up making two copies of everything.  I don't know how TM treats symlinks.  If it does, then add /home to the exclude list of TM.\n", "Q: Can I remove the clip of the iPod nano 6G?

It is really annoying.\nHow can I solve the problem and get the automatic updates really automatic?\nThere is a question here: iTunes shows App Updates Badge, but no updates are available with no answer though\nUPD: well, looks like there is no good solution...\nUPD 2: I was insistent enough in my emails to support and among 2 pages of other irrelevant lines this is what I see:\n\nI have regranted all available Apps back to your account as a one time exception.\n\nSo, well, probably the problem is solved partially for now :-)\nUPD 3:\nGot 250+ updates in my itunes.

First and most important is that you're on the same country store as the purchased app. No matter where you move around the world you're bound to the country store which the app  is purchased from.\nI have never attempted moving from one country App store to another. But this would require changing your billing information on the account and a verification of credit card billing address which has to be within the territories covered by that App store.\n\nA: The brief overview of what I have done.\nI've written an email to iTunes store support. And got absolutely irrelevant answer, that just described the issue's roots and was not helpful at all. As a reply I asked almost the same but with different words and got the answer that made me angry:\n\nIvan, in future if you revert the country to Russia and as long as  the purchased application are available in that country, you can update apps.\n\nOn this reply I replied back with the question - if I need to relocate just to get the updates for the apps I paid my money for. And as a reply got another email with another irrelevant and hopeless answer:\n\nIvan, your inquiry is very important to me, so I have requested assistance with the issue you reported. You will receive an email after the matter has been investigated and further information is available.\nThank you for your patience. Apple wants your iTunes experience to be as enjoyable as possible.\n\nAfter that I decided to ask the question once again. So I created yet another support ticket with completely the same title and message body (I copied them as-is).\nAnd after a day of waiting got a huge 2.5 pages letter with boring explanation how to update applications (written for completely newbies, step-by-step manual), then the magic paragraph:\n\nYou are still able to download previously purchased applications again for free if they are available on your new country's store.

I've never seen this behavior before. What could be causing this?\n\nA: I too have seen this on multiple macs with multiple OS / iTunes versions in the last few days. No amount of client changes seem to resolve it (the downloads themselves don't need to be cleared, clearing them doesn't help, and the situation does resolve itself in time with no user intervention. Usually the wait is 5 to 15 minutes to clear in my experience.) It seems to happen at the same times when my iOS devices struggle to re-download past purchases from the store.\n\nMy guess is you are seeing a delay in the code signing checks which are being queued on the server side to wait for their turn. It's clear that the download is very rapid and the app is done downloading the app. \n\nMy guess is Apple now serves identical apps (unsigned to your account) to iTunes on your computer. Then your computer requests that that app get signed to run under your Apple ID and those requests are queued and that is why nothing is happening on iTunes while \"processing\" is taking place.\nI have seen this come and go and presume it's a capacity issue on the Apple server side and not anything new or changed on our iTunes computers.\nAnecdotally, there have been all sorts of errors and slowness in reaching the store lately. I would love to see the server logs for loads and error rates to know if this suspicion is correct. If my guess is correct, this will only happen when the download volume exceeds the servers that are running to do the signing. If so, it will be easy for Apple to spin up more signers as needed to meet demand in the future (as well as scale back to save costs when demand is lower than say iPad launch weekend).\n", "Q: Is it safe to play the Macbook Pro/Air speakers at maximum volume? The Macbook Pro speakers have a very crisp sound. I like to play them at almost max. volume very often.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the speakers suffer a loss in quality?\n\n*Is this save to use on the long run? \n\nA: The cones in almost any speaker will break down over time. Various environmental factors will determine how long a speaker lasts, but overdriving the element can definitely have an adverse effect.\nIt's impossible to provide any precise data but in short, you're probably shortening the life of the speakers (by an indeterminate amount of time) by running them at maximum volume but, provided you're not hearing any distortion from the speakers, you're not damaging them by doing so.\n", "Q: How can I zoom in TextEdit? I am given documents from various different sources in various different formats to work with. I use TextEdit to read and make small edits to them.\nTextEdit can read and edit all of the formats I need it to: Word 2003 (.doc), Word 2007 (.docx), RTF, and TXT.

I just bought a Time Capsule, and the lack of modem is irritating, as this means I have to buy a seperate one which is another box, won't be as easy to set up and I have to choose one.\nDoes Apple make a modem themselves, that can be used with a Time Capsule simply and easily? If they don't is there a suggested one for a Time Capsule?\nEDIT: I live in the UK, my ISP is TalkTalk and it is ADSL.\n\nA: Apple don't make a modem, but depending on your internet/cable/fiber provider, you may be able to encourage them to give you one for free. \nI have Virgin Media in the UK and new customers receive a new Super Hub free (which can easily be configured to be a slave modem, you just turn the wireless off). The same is true of most of the free 'hubs' provided by networks these days. \n\nA: They do not make a modem, at least not an external one.  I'm sure older Macs have them but that's not appropriate for your requirements, and they were not ADSL modems anyway.\nI have found that there are few modems available (although there is one DLINK one and a TP-LINK one that looks useful, but I have found that the cheapest way to sort one out is to get almost any old Wireless Router with a modem built in, and configure it in Bridge mode that basically turns off all routing/firewall/NAT/DHCP/Wireless etc functions, and just let's the Apple router (Time Capsule, Airport Extreme Router, etc) pass the old router a username and password and ask it to make the connection and pass the traffic through the link.\nI currently use a DLINK DSL2740B Wireless Modem Router in this way, just using the modem functionality.\nUsing Bridge mode is a far better way than running an old router in normal mode and just turning the wireless off, as it allows proper configuration of back to my Mac etc and allows you to use the standard OS X tools for managing your network rather than having to remember some weirdo IP address and do it all via a dodgy web interface.\n\nA: There are many kinds of modems, because there are many different technologies used to provide an Internet connection. Which one are you using?\nBy \"modem\" you could mean dial-up telephone (POTS), or any of a variety of ADSL, cable TV, fiber-optic-to-the-premises like AT&T UVerse, T-1, or many other types of modems. These vary around the world depending on the technology that the various Internet service providers use.\nSo which \"suggested one\" model of modem for a Time Capsule would depend entirely on which Internet service provider company you are using, and what kind of method of connecting you to the Internet you are paying for (dial-up telephone, DSL, cable TV, fiber optic, satellite dish, etc.), and ultimately what country in the world you live in. This is not a question with a simple answer.\nApple doesn't make modems, because there's no way that Apple could make all the many different devices that would be required to work with all the different Internet service providers all over the world. There are some Internet service providers that won't even let a customer choose or purchase their own modem for certain kinds of services; they require that you rent the equipment directly from them.\nAll you need to do is to use whatever method of connection you have to your Internet service provider (the \"modem\"), and read its manual to find out how to put it in \"bridge mode\" or \"DMZ mode\" so that you can connect your Apple Time Capsule or Apple AirPort directly to the modem, and have all your computing devices connect to the Apple Time Capsule's router.\n", "Q: Reinstalling Lion on a Wiped Disk I have MacBook that was running Lion.\nOn a journey into finding the perfect operating system for me, I installed Arch Linux. Whilst doing this I wiped the disk (/dev/sda1) and created some Linux partitions.\nNow, for reasons beyond my control, I'm in need of some Mac OS capabilities. \nYet, I have no idea on how to reinstall Lion. (I wiped the recovery disk, so it doesn't show up when holding option whilst booting, but luckily option-booting does still work). Is there anywhere I can get a bootable ISO (preferably free), from which Lion can be installed (through the App Store perhaps?). I have an old Snow Leopard disk laying around but it won't boot because of hardware incompatabilities (CPU isn't working).\nOr, am I left no choice but buying a bootable Lion USB stick? PS: no bashing on Lion here from me. I like Lion, I like Mac. I just dislike the GNU tools available are always slightly different from their Linux counterparts, making cooperation with my Linux-loving peers a nightmare.\nPPS: I would consider doing something \"dark\" to get everything working again. Also, I wouldn't mind losing my Arch partition, since I can always get it back from a backup.\nedit\nThe machine I'm talking about is a 13\" macbook pro 8,2. \nThe only tool I have is another macbook pro, an older one, that ran OS X snow leopard, but is updated to Lion recently. (aha, this can serve my purpose).\n\nA: What model Mac do you have? That will limit the recovery options. Internet recovery or putting your Mac into target mode and connecting it to another Mac to run the installer are two good places to start. \nAlso, you can install Lion onto any old USB drive and then bring that to your Mac to boot up and fix things. Remember you only need a Mac that runs 10.6.8 to get at Lion from the app store. As long as you have an Internet connection, you can download the lion installer and run it to install over your Mac. Assuming it has a FireWire port, you can run the install in target disk mode. If not, you'll need to install to an external USB drive then take that drive to your Mac to boot things up. \n\nA: This article will walk you through creating a bootable lion disk - although in order to 'purchase' you'd need to have access to a mac. Hope that helps (and good luck!)\n", "Q: I'd like to upgrade my MacBook Pro's RAM and hard drive. What brands are reliable? I do heavy web development/web design and run my software on a MacBook Pro (Mid 2009) 2.8ghz model. I use Adobe products, run virtual machines in Parallels, have multiple browsers open, text editors and sometimes IDE's. That's how I typically use my machine.\nI'd like to upgrade my RAM and possibly get a larger capacity hard drive, but I'm not sure what brands to buy.\nFrom what I've read so far, it looks like Kingston HyperX KHX1600C9S3P1K2/8G is what I need. As for a hard drive I'm after something reliable. No nasty surprises a year from now.\nI would really appreciate some advice as this is something I've delayed doing since I purchased my MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I did the same to one of my old macs and opted for Crucial Memory and a Western Digital hard drive. Their still going strong and I've had absolutely no problems (and the WD drive is really fast)\n\nA: OWC\nI buy everything from these guys. They can get RAM and hard drives for just about any Mac and it's almost always within $5 of Newegg, without having to sort through their PC crap. \nThey sell exclusively Apple stuff and it's easy to find what you're looking for. Usually free or less than $3-5 shipping and it's super fast (even for the free/cheap shipping). \nIn your question, you mentioned that you don't want any nasty surprises down the road. If you really don't, then back up. Know that every hard drive will eventually fail. Some will drop dead in a year, some will drop dead in 10 years. You just won't know until it happens, usually. \nThere are two best practices for avoiding catastrophic hard drive failure:\n\n\n*\n\n*BACK UP.\n(can't stress this enough)\n\n*Buy quality hard drives from good companies. I, for instance, will not buy a hard drive from anyone but Hitachi. OWC sells hitachi hard drives. They're a little more expensive, but I've never had one die on me. That being said, I still back up.\n", "Q: Preserve Window Spaces Placement Between Restarts I use Spaces to organize the task I'm pursing. In that vein, I often will have a browser window on each Space, with open tabs relevant to that task that Space is used for.\nFor example, Space 1 is for Work. So in addition to work applications, I have a browser window open with tabs relevant to work. Space 2 is for Photography. And Space 3 is for just general browsing and social networking, etc.\nI am easily able to put a different browser window into each space. The problem is that when I restart the computer, all windows appear in the first Space!\nMy browser is Chrome, and perhaps this is an issue I need to take up with the Chrome team. Or is this a bug in OS X Lion?\n\nA: I encountered this posting while searching for a way to do exactly what OP wanted to do.\nInterestingly, Finder seems to do it right -- when you have multiple Finder windows in various Spaces, and restart your Mac (or if you just \"killall Finder\" at Terminal, which restarts Finder), they go into the Spaces where they were.\nAlso, Safari often does that too. Safari seems to preserve the Space each window was opened at, if you restart your Mac with all the browsers open. But Safari fails to remember Spaces if you simply quit and restart the app itself.\nSo I guess it's not true that it is impossible to achieve this, but there seem to be some issues within the Mac system that do not allow this all the time for all apps.\nBut I'm hopeful that someone could find out a tweak.\n\nA: Full-screen mode in Safari is the only way I see to solve your problem. Full-screen mode will assign each window it's own space which will be restored on resume.\nHowever, the order of the full-screen windows (of the same application) will still change on resume - no matter if you have enabled Automatically rearrange spaces in System Preferences → Mission Control.\nUnfortunately, the full-screen resume only works in Safari - not in Chrome or Firefox (as of March 2012).\n\nA: Organizing program windows by space by pre-defined setting is unfortunately not possible. By that I mean there is no way to \"lock\" particular windows into their space that endures through a reboot. As you mentioned, you can assign particular programs to spaces, but not particular program windows. And, as you also noted, they apparently don't re-start the windows in their previous spaces.\n\nA: You are right assuming that this is a problem that should be solved by the Chrome team and there already is the old bug #74812 in their issue tracker for it.\nSadly this is a long running annoyance for many (including me) which also shows that it also appears in other questions here, e.g. Restore app windows to their original Spaces\n\nA: There's a regression causing this issue with Firefox. Vote for this bug if you'd like to see it fixed (once you log in, open the \"Details\" dropdown on the bug page to vote for it): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642310\n\nA: Try using Firefox. It remembers the window settings correctly.\n", "Q: Is there an iOS program that performs multivariate linear regression? I'm looking for an iOS program that can calculate some statistics for me.\nI want a program into which I can enter a bunch of observations, then the program uses multivariate linear regression (ordinary least squares) to find coefficients and standard errors for the line of best fit. I know of plenty of programs that do this on the Mac, but not any iOS programs.\nThere aren't any programs in the app store that list this as one of their key features, but I didn't know if it was an additional feature in something like Numbers. Alternately, while I'd prefer not a web app, that's certainly better than not having an app to do this. A web app that uses local storage so it can run even when offline would be best.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I don't think Wolfram Alpha's main app or their Linear Algebra Course Assistant are there yet with general multivariate linear regression but their email support is great and you might ask them which product of theirs might get that first. These do not run offline - so you may have to wait for the whole enchilada to arrive. \nIn the mean time, you will need to use something like Matlab mobile to connect back to a computer that can actually run the numbers for you. This is a step better than just running screens as it lets you do input natively on iOS and shuttles forth and back the data to the main engine running remotely.\nAs you commented, you could get a matrix manipulation tool - both the Linear Algebra Course Assistant and a few other apps like matrix calculator plus will invert matrices for you. \n", "Q: Disable Time Machine hourly backups Can the hourly backups by Time Machine be stopped? I'm on Lion and if it matters, each hour it tries to backup about 30GB  (I don't know where this 30GB comes from, as today I've only modified a few text files and browsed the web). This results in the computer slowing down noticeable and beachballing more often.\nOr even better than stopping them completely change the hourlys to every 2-4 hours?\nIt is backing up to a TimeCapsule, so I think the network might be the reason it is slowing down noticeable, that and it's a late 2008 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: To adjust the schedule in order to backup at a time more to your choosing than simply every hour, you can use the Time Machine Editor tool, which is available as a free download from:\nhttp://timesoftware.free.fr/timemachineeditor/\n\nTimeMachineEditor is a software for Mac OS X Leopard, Snow Leopard and\n  Lion that lets you change the default one-hour backup interval of Time\n  Machine. You can change the interval or create a more sophisticated\n  scheduling (see screenshot below).   This is useful if you don’t need\n  to backup every hour and don’t want the performance penalty. This is\n  also especially useful if you manipulate lots of data within one hour\n  as you would spend the whole day backing up.\n\nChanging your interval should not affect the daily or monthly backups, which are not actually any different to the hourly ones in any material way.\n\nTo get a better idea of what is causing large or lengthy backups, you can use the Backup Loupe software, available for free download at:\nhttp://soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/\n\n\"With BackupLoupe you are able to answer questions like Why is Time\n  Machine so slow?

A quick experiment had shown that the overhead (actual storage / bare file storage) is too high, although I do not have a concrete number to mention at this time.\nNow that I have an iPad, I am stumped by how to get my photos onto the iPad by a simple file copy. Do you have an opinion one way or the other? Did you for instance find a decent way to get your photo library onto the iPad without first handing the photos to iPhoto? Or did you find that the overhead of iPhoto is tolerable in the long run?\n\nA: The easiest way is probably the camera connection kit: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC531ZM/A?fnode=MTc0MjU4NjE\nBut, depends on the app. I've found drop-box to be very easy for simple file transfers.\nIf you open iTunes you can also configure which files can be copied into which app under the App tab when you control the device.\n", "Q: How can I limit my download bandwidth?

You can just download it from the Apple servers by visiting the RedMondPie website. Links are listed below the page.\n\nA: If you have the download, it's possible, but as you don't you will likely have to hunt it down on Bittorrent, at which point you are in your own, but in essence you can apply any version you have got the file for so long as you are upgrading, downgrading will not work\nThe file was originally hosted here but the actual download link has been removed.  Apple only keep the most current versions available to download, so you will have to hunt a copy down and I am not able to assist in that (although if you know someone who has already used that level more than once then rifling through there Time Machine backups or iTunes folders may yield results.  Actually, as indicated in @michiel's answer, the links remain, they are just hard to find, so if you can find a list like the one maintained here you are good to go.\nTo perform the upgrade once you have the file, and to stop iTunes simply checking for the most recent update and offering to apply that, you should select your iPhone in the connected device list after connecting by USB, go to the summary tab, check in the versions section.  Instead of just clicking update, hold the option key down and then click.  You will now be offered a finder style file picker to allow you to point it at your downloaded file.  Selecting this will allow you to upgrade to your choice of OS.\nNOTE:  Perform a full backup of your phone before doing any upgrade.\nNOTE: I am not able to explain why you cannot back level in the same manner, it's something to do with baseband and I don't understand why.\n\nA: You can just download the ipsw file for ios 5.0.1 (im sure you'd find it somewhere in google) and restore with pwned dfu mode on the latest redsn0w version 0.9.15b3\n", "Q: Command Line Tools fail to install OS X Lion 10.7.3 Xcode 4.3 I'm trying to install the command line tools to get gcc, make, and other goodies after a Lion upgrade.

The progress is shown in a bar that goes around the circular track on the outside.\nIt means that it can be listened to via streaming (by clicking on it in the normal manner) if you have a suitable internet connection but has not yet been downloaded to the device.\n", "Q: Where does GarageBand put its downloaded instruments and loop libraries? I've been using the new(ish) GarageBand on Lion for a month or so now. Early on, it prompted me to download instrument sample libraries and loops of around 1.5 GB which were not included in the initial installation. Then, it wanted a similarly-sized download to support iOS GarageBand files. I just recently found another download to enable more loops and MIDI voices.\nWhat is the total size of all of these extra downloads, and where do they go?\n\nA: Neither of these worked for me. Mine were all located into /Library/Audio/'Apple Loops', /Library/Audio/'Apple Loops Index', /Library/Audio/'Impulse Responses', /Library/'Application Support'/GarageBand, /Library/'Application Support'/Logic, i.e. nothing left under ~/Library after I uninstalled GarageBand!\n\nA: The last time I looked it was in:\n\n/Library/Application Support/GarageBand\n\nIf they aren't there you can also try:\n\n~/Library/Application Support/GarageBand\n\nSince all the downloaded content is installed per machine, and not per user, it does make it a bit easier to backup if you don't use a Time Capsule, or otherwise to transfer these downloads between multiple machines.\nI use the Learn To Play videos and when having to move them between 4 different Mac's I learned quickly where to go find them.\n\nA: As for total size, that is difficult to say. I got my GarageBand instrument, sample library and loop files from an iLife DVD installation a few years ago, rather than downloading them from the Mac App Store, which is the only way to get them today.\nIt's my understanding that when you first purchase and install GarageBand from the Mac App Store, you do not get all the musical instrument sample libraries and loop libraries that are listed in GarageBand's indexes. If you try to select an instrument or loop from an index and it is not found on your Mac, then you are prompted to download another large section of the libraries. Then there are the music lessons, which you must purchase one at a time, download and install.\nMy basic installation for GarageBand instruments and music lessons in ~/Library/Application Support/GarageBand is 2.74GB.\nThe loops for GarageBand are stored in ~/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/, and my installation is 629.9MB. However I do not believe that I have downloaded the whole set.\nAt an Apple retailer where I have worked, their installation in \n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/GarageBand is 14.57GB, \n\n\nand their installation in\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Audio/Apple Loops is 32GB.\n\n\nThis includes the GarageBand-compatible instruments and loops that you get when you purchase Apple MainStage, which you can get from the Mac App Store for $30. However, this does not include all the music lessons you can purchase within GarageBand.\nFurthermore, you can purchase all sorts of Audio Unit-format effects, musical instruments, sample libraries and loop libraries from third parties that you can use within Garage Band or Logic, so you could add many hundreds of gigabytes of additional material if you want to.\nIt is worth mentioning that electronic musicians who work with large libraries of virtual instruments, samples and loops in GarageBand or other similar programs invariably move all such libraries to external high-speed disk drives so as not to slow down their systems with too much read-write activity on the system hard drive. \nIf your work with GarageBand is simple enough--not too many tracks in a mix--you can work with just your Mac and system hard drive. But if you discover that Garageband is glitching, hiccuping, or failing to record or edit correctly, or you get errors about input and output being too slow, you need to incorporate additional high-speed hard disks into your system.\nIt's a general principle that you need at least three hard drives: \n\n\n*\n\n*your system drive inside your Mac, which holds Mac OS X and the\nGarageBand app \n\n*an external high-speed hard drive for sample\nlibraries, virtual instruments and loop libraries \n\n*another external high-speed hard drive for recording and mixing audio tracks.\n\n\nAll of these have to be interfaced with a high-speed interface such as FireWire 800, USB 3.0, or Thunderbolt. USB 2.0 will not work, because it is not fast enough for composing, recording and mixing music and audio.\n", "Q: Is there a gesture to navigate back to previous page in iPad 2 (or the new iPad)? I've just bought a new iPad, but it's so annoying when I have to click the arrow on the top left of the page to navigate back and forth using Safari. I wonder is there a gesture for navigating that I'm not aware of?\n\nA: Safari on a standard iPad does not have a gesture for returning to the previous page. \n", "Q: Symbol/Special Character use in OS X and iOS I am looking to insert a special character or symbol into my documents, which are intended to be markdown formatted text files.  The symbol is intended to be used to represent a tick box or other tick/cross visual symbol (either empty, or actually ticked).  Examples provided below (inserted using Edit > Special Characters in Safari)\n☐☑☒✓✕❏\nOnce I have used it in a file, I want the symbol to be readable regardless of whether I view the file through an app in either OS X or iOS, as well as capable of being inserted from any source including the iPhone keyboard\nWhat is the best method of ensuring consistent input and viewing of such characters works across the board, is there a particular font family or Unicode code that will enable portability across my devices, and is there a simple way to insert them, possibly via text expander or autocorrect if they are not on the main keyboard?\n\nA: Viewing Special Characters\nThe good news is that this part should almost always 'just work' on OS X and iOS devices. Encodings are usually handled intelligently, Unicode fonts are installed, and font substitution does its job.\nIf you do encounter problems, be sure to specify the encoding as Unicode (UTF-8) when saving. If your text editor doesn't allow you to specify an encoding, it's a fairly safe bet that this is what it's using.\nSince Markdown files are plaintext, you don't have to worry about fonts. If you are using rich formatting, though, Lucida Grande, Arial Unicode, and Apple Symbol are all good options. But, again, OS X and iOS generally switch to another font seamlessly when the main font doesn't support a character.\nEntering Special Characters\nBoth OS X and iOS include built-in text replacement tools that will let you insert your symbols easily.\nOS X\nOpen System Preferences-> Language and Text-> Text and click the [+] button. Choose a keyword to be expanded and paste in the special character. You'll have to create snippets with unique keywords for each character.\n\niOS\nCopy a special character. Open Settings-> General-> Keyboard-> Shortcuts and tap the [+] button. Paste the character under Phrase and enter a unique keyword under Shortcut. Tap save. Again, you'll have to create snippets with unique keywords for each character.\n\nIf you like, you can use the excellent TextExpander to do the same thing, but it isn't necessary in this case.\n\nA: For that task, I usually take two routes depending on the complexity of the task. To simply input a character, I'd use Uklele to remap the keyboard. But if the task requires more than just the input of a character I'd add/modify ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict which uses Cocoa Text System to bind certain keys of your choice to operations available to all Cocoa Text System based apps. You can run a search on google for DefaultKeyBinding.dict and you'll find lot's of resources to explain the operations.\nRegarding the fonts, I think Lucida Grande has many of those special characters on OSX. Whatever character you choose, you can see a list of font based variations of it in the Character Viewer if you expand that window. Note that this floating window does expand without the display of the windows resize mouse pointer.\n", "Q: How can I keep my iPhone / iPods cooler in a hot vehicle? Sometimes I have to leave my phone in a hot car and don't have any other options other than leaving it in a locked car in the summer heat. What are ways to keep the phone cooler and not overheat it or worse cause damage to the batteries, etc.\nThe other day I got a overheat warning on my iPhone after having to leave it in the car. What are some ways to prevent this?\n\nA: Place the electronics that contain a lithium based battery in the shade and keep windows open a crack. If possible, place the vehicle in the shade or use light or reflective colored windshield shades to reduce the heat that stays in the car.\nUsually the trunk (or a well insulated bag) will lag the passenger compartment many tens of degrees and warm up several hours slower than something in the main cabin.\n\nA: Coffee cups (with lid, of course)\nThe most flexible and cheap solution are coffee cups. These cups are usually designed to have insulating walls.\nInsulation is the most effective way to prevent heat building up. You might want to prefer white cups, but it should not make much of a difference.\n \n\nA: Insulation, not only can it keep stuff warm for longer, but it can also stop stuff heating up in the first place.  So anything that provides insulative properties, styrofoam cups etc can be used.  Even a cardboard box.\nThe first rule of thumb is to keep the thing out of direct sunlight, and even if it's on a pocket or compartment, choose one that is also not directly shone upon.\nAnother thing would be to turn if off while unattended in the car.  If you have left it in the car, you can't be actively using it, so turn that sucker off and save some battery while you are at it.\n\nA: The use of insulated material around some \"smart\" phones, such as styrofoam cups w/ lids (as mentioned here), could create enough heat from the phone itself to cause a fire; just as reports that have shown some sleeping owners have been known to accidentally smother the phone with nearby blankets and/or pillows while in bed, thus causing the igniting of a fire around it. But no one would likely be there to stop that dangerous situation in a parked vehicle.\n", "Q: tab to select drop-down input box In any web browser in Mac OS X, how can I choose a drop-down form input box using the tab key? When I need to input many forms including a drop-down box, I preferred to use tab key and shift+tab to move between input elements in Windows systems.\nWhy is it impossible in Mac, and how can I do it?\n\nA: Make sure you have this set (it's not the default) in Keyboard Preferences\n\n", "Q: How can I move files to different Dropbox folders on my iPad? My specific need came from using a plaintext editor (Plaintext, although the issue is similar in IA Writer, Byword, etc.) where I can create new folders to organize my .txt docs, and I create new docs in them, but I can't move existing ones into or out of folders.\nSo I thought, surely I can switch over to the Dropbox app, move the files to the desired folders there, then come back, but that's not the case.   There's not even a move function in the Dropbox app.\nIs there some way on an iPad to move a file in Dropbox to a different folder in Dropbox (that doesn't involve logmein or some other VPN app that lets me access my Mac)?\n\nA: There is a move function within the dropbox app.\nGo to the folder that contains the file(s) you want to move and click on the check icon.\n\nSelect the file(s) you want to move and click on move on the lower right corner. Now a new window will appear. Choose the location where you want to move the file and tab the choose button.\n\nThat's it.\n\nA: Goodreader\nGoodreader can do this easily. It is the swiss-armyknive for filehandling on the iPad and it supports a large number of storage servers.\nFrom http://www.goodiware.com/gr-man-tr-servers.html#dropbox:\nGoodReader offers you a server-style access to Dropbox. It allows you to browse your Dropbox account like a simple file server. You can download, upload, sync and delete files and entire folders.\nGoodReader can publish individual files and folders from your Dropbox account. Select files and folders you want to share with others, press the Share button, and GoodReader will create a special public downloading link and send it via email.\n\nA: Okay I am using an apple macbook and this is the best video for that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuTH4qVqUhk\n", "Q: How can I keep copies of my iCloud documents in Dropbox? More and more of my favorite apps are beginning to include support for document syncing via iCloud.\nI like the idea of using iCloud to store my documents, but for several reasons I'm not ready to switch over completely from Dropbox.\nIs there some kind of an iCloud-Dropbox bridge or other way of syncing documents between iCloud and either Dropbox directly or the local filesystem of my Mac? Ideally it would work both ways, pulling from iCloud and pushing into it.\n\nA: I am not absolutely certain, but I believe this is impossible.\nFor one thing, there isn't iCloud support for simply syncing files. Apps are expected to keep their synced files in their own folders (and are restricted to accessing this folder alone). This means that there's no way to have an iCloud document accessible my multiple apps.\nFor another thing, even if you were willing to concede and only sync, say, Pages documents with iCloud and Dropbox (hypothetically), Pages for iOS documents are very different from Pages for Mac documents. Here are two screenshots, one of the inside of a Mac Pages document and one of an iOS Pages document, respectively:\n \nPost script: hypothetically, though, if you could figure something out, it would probably involve somehow linking ~/Library/Mobile Documents with Dropbox.\n\nA: If you want to follow on from Tim's final suggestion - \nYou can just create a link into a DropBox folder - there is even an app to do it:\nhttp://dropboxwiki.com/MacDropAny\nUsing that you can define any folder on your laptop to be added to DropBox. It creates the link for you.\n", "Q: Why does voice dictation not always appear on the new iPad? The new iPad supports voice dictation for voice input, but apparently only sometimes. I understand that some things should not support it, such as password inputs and URLs, for example. What dictates (excuse the pun) where this functionality is offered, and where it is not? \n\nA: The following conditions must be met in order for dictation to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must be connected to the Internet for dictation to work.\n\n*You shouldn't be using audio on your device (e.g. if you are on a FaceTime call, the button will not appear.)\n\n*You must be focused in an text field which is formatted for normal text (more about this below.)\n\n\n\nDevelopers (and even Web Developers) can choose which keyboard layout will be visible to the user, via the UIKeyboardType property. Here's an example of several different keyboard layouts and what they look like on an iPhone (without dictation).\nThe dictation button is available in the following keyboard types:\n\n\n*\n\n*Standard (UIKeyboardTypeASCIICapable)\n\n\nBut is not available in the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Telephone (UIKeyboardTypePhonePad)\n\n*URL (UIKeyboardTypeURL)\n\n*Email (UIKeyboardTypeEmailAddress)\n\n*Zipcode (UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad)\n\n", "Q: When I save a document, can I enter the location with path input? When I save a document in any editing program, it pops up a save window where I can choose the desired save location by clicking folder names.\nInstead of mouse-clicks, I like to input the path name directly using keyboards. For example, \n\n\n*\n\n*when I want to save a document in the folder of \\Users\\myusername\\Dropbox\\myfoldername, I want to actually type it.\n\n*In the current working directory, I want to create a sub-directory and save it. In such a case, I want to actually type something like subfoldername\\filename.ext, instead of create a new folder and then save.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: Basically, just start typing the path you want to use in the Save As: field. The Go to Folder dialog will appear when you type / or ~ and let you type your path. Type your path and press return. You can include the filename at the end of the path and it will update the name automatically.\nYou can also access the Go to Folder dialog manually using  ⌘-⇧-G.\nYou can't create a new folder by typing the path, but you can use a keyboard shortcut to create the folder. Use Go to Folder to get as deep as you can into existing folders, then type ⌘-⇧-N. Type the name of the folder and press enter.\nThe field with the filename will selected, so you can just type your name and press return.\n\nThis question has inspired a post on the Ask Different Blog that contains the answer, as well as other tips for working with open/save dialogs.\n", "Q: Does Voice Dictation on the New iPad require a network connection? Does the the new iPad's voice dictation require a network connection? I ask because Siri does require an active network connection and I am wondering if voice dictation works in a similar manner.\n\nA: Yes.\nWith many methods of voice dictation, what happens is that your voice is recorded and digitized, and your speech is broken up into phrases which are uploaded over the Internet to a powerful computer server which translates your speech into text and then transmits the text back to your device.\nHowever, there is a long history of programs for Mac and PC which perform voice dictation and transcription entirely on your Mac or PC without using an Internet connection.\nI don't know of any apps for iOS that perform voice transcription entirely on the device without using a connection to a server on the Internet.\n\nA: Yes - if your device has no network connection, the Voice Dictation key will not appear on the keyboard.\nIf your network connection does not route properly to Apple's servers, then you can tap the button and speak, but the three magenta circles that pulse will remain on screen until the iPad can get a response from the servers or you cancel the input. \n\nYou also get the usual network circle spinner in the menu bar to the right of the Wifi / Data Connection icons to indicate a network wait status is ongoing.\n", "Q: How can I tell iTunes to stop playing a song? I do mean stop, not pause. If one navigates to, say, the iTunes Store, the Pause button changes to Stop, but I want something that always works no matter my location in iTunes.\nWorkarounds (such as AppleScript) are acceptable as long as they aren't too difficult to set up.\n\nA: The AppleScript for this is pretty simple:\ntell application \"iTunes\" to stop\n\nYou can make this easily accessible by creating a Service.\nOpen Automator and create a new document. Select the Service document type. Set the Service receives: menu to no input. Drag in a Run AppleScript module and paste that code into its text box. Save the service and give it a name.\nYou'll now be able to activate it by going to the current app's menu and choosing Services-> Stop iTunes (or whatever you named the service).\nYou can assign a keyboard shortcut by going to System Preferences-> Keyboard-> Services, finding the service (it should be under General at the bottom) and adding a shortcut.\n\nA: In Applescript, the script tell app \"iTunes\" to stop should work. \nAnd the pause button is only available in the currently playing playlist; anywhere else, it will be stop.\n\nA: There are three correct answers here. I've tried two of them to see that they work. Command-period stops the currently playing song and so does Option-Pause. I've seen the Command period solution before but cannot remember where I found it. The Option-pause solution is new to me, but I'm glad to have two solutions. Maybe I'll remember at least one of them. ;-)\nThe Apple Script solution probably works too, but it makes things more difficult then they need to be, given the other two solutions. That said, at some time in the distant past I created a Scripts folder in the ~/Library/iTunes folder and placed some scripts in it. As a result I have a Scripts icon next to the Help menu in iTunes. That's where I'd put the script if I wanted to use it. No need to create a service or keyboard shortcut to it. By the way, I tested this option: I quit iTunes and then put the Scripts folder in the trash. I launched iTunes and the scripts item in the menu bar was gone. I quit iTunes and restored the Scripts folder, launched iTunes and there it was again in the menu bar. From this I conclude that anyone can create a Scripts folder for iTunes if they want to. That would be an easier way to use the script it you wanted to go that route. You cannot create a keyboard shortcut for it, though, because the Scripts item in the iTunes menu uses an icon, not a name. I tried it; no go. Hope this answer isn't too long.\n\nA: Hold the Option key down, while clicking the Pause button.\n\nA: You can't! What I do is either \"Quit iTunes\" or delete the tract (I only delete if I already have the song on a DVD; I can add it back to my library at a later date).\niTunes is not user friendly. I use it sparingly.\n", "Q: What is wrong with the content protection of AirPlay that some applications prevent its use? I've been enjoying March Madness from both my iPhone and iPad via the March Madness Live application. In fact I've enjoyed the app so much I purchased an Apple TV so I could watch games via AirPlay. Unfortunately, when I attempt to send the games to the Apple TV the commercials play but the games do not and instead the Apple TV just displays a spinning icon. Some quick Googling turned up the March Madness Live FAQ which contains this disappointing tidbit:\n\nIs Airplay supported?No airplay is not supported on this application.\n  The 2012 March Madness Live™ requires a level of content protection\n  that is currently not supported by Airplay.\n\nAdditional Googling for AirPlay content protection turns up no immediately useful results. I can speculate what the application developers might be objecting to about AirPlay's security, but I am looking for a definitive answer. Not specific to the thought process of the particular March Madness Live application developers, but in general.\nWhat is it about AirPlay's content protection that would cause an application developer to prevent its use?\nThere is a somewhat related question concerning why some applications only play audio via AirPlay.\n\nA: Airplay isn't a protected transfer mechanism, in the same way that playing (for example) a Blu Ray disc over a HDMI connection that supports HDCP.\nHigh-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP; commonly, though incorrectly, referred to as High-Definition Copy(right) Protection) is a form of digital copy protection developed by Intel Corporation to prevent copying of digital audio and video content as it travels across connections. These connections include popular ones like DisplayPort (DP), Digital Visual Interface (DVI), and High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)\nThe system is meant to stop HDCP-encrypted content from being played on devices that do not support HDCP or which have been modified to copy HDCP content. Before sending data, a transmitting device checks that the receiver is authorized to receive it. If so, the transmitter encrypts the data to prevent eavesdropping as it flows to the receiver.\nThat's pretty technical, but in short (and this is not particular a developer choice, but the content owners choice) if they cannot guarantee that the content is fully secure end to end, they will not allow it to be transmitted.  Airplay isn;t fully secure to the same degree as the above, and so many contents owners will not agree to it's use.\n\nA: It's the lack of content protection that prevents some popular streaming apps that cable companies are coming with from working with airplay. It wouldn't be difficult to reverse engineer and airplay protocol and record content and redistribute it, similar to how this one developer made an app to stream airplay from an idevice to a mac. She was able to figure out how the protocol worked just by examining it, which is a security flaw that could lead to piracy. (as if bit torrent doesn't exist lol)\n", "Q: iPad app to manage photos stored in cloud? I currently have several thousand (15GB) photographs stored on a PC. I would like to move them all to the cloud somewhere and use the iPad to manage them - change names, put in folders, etc. I also want to be able to copy pictures from the iPad to my collection in the cloud. I'm not committed to where in cloudland I should store my pictures - maybe PicasaWeb, dropbox, Amazon S3, or something else. I'm happy to choose based on what would work the best with an iPad management app.\n\nA: Adobe Revel ($5.99pm or $59.99py)\nAdobe Revel (previously called carousel) is a cloud photo editing and storage app, similar to Adobe Lightroom with the added function of being able to store images in the cloud. It is a subscription based service.\nHowever this is currently only available on iOS, and Mac, with both Windows and Android currently in development.\nIf you were desperate to use this solution, you can get the iPad app, and sync the photos over iTunes and then use the app to pop the images in the cloud, however this would be time consuming, the Adobe website has a notify me, button on Windows/Android, so this platform will be available. \n", "Q: How can I get Angry Birds on my Mac? I tried using iTunes, but it only seems to have downloads for iPhone and iPad only. How can I get a version I can play on my iMac?\n\nA: The App Store found in iTunes is only for iPhone/iPod/iPad apps. Mac apps can be found on the Mac App Store. Angry Birds is available for Mac for $5.\nYou can also play for free online at http://chrome.angrybirds.com/.\nNote that iPhone and iPad apps are not linked to desktop Mac apps, so when you buy an app for an iPhone or iPad, it does not come with a Mac version and there is no guarantee that a Mac version is even available.\nSometimes apps are available on both the iOS (iPhone/iPad) App Store and the separate Mac App Store, as is the case for Angry Birds.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is not supported anymore.\nhttps://support.rovio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042909613-I-can-t-find-Angry-Birds-Classic-in-my-app-store-anymore-what-s-up-with-that-\n", "Q: Can I regenerate the the photo thumbnails that have turned black after restoring my iPhone? I had to restore my iOS 5.1 iPhone from iCloud after recieving a replacement. Many of the thumbnails for photographs are now black. Is there a way to regenerate them?\n\nA: Wait and see. When I looked the following morning, the black thumbnails had all been regenerated automatically.\n\nA: I may have experienced something similar the other day when my new iPad (3) arrived, and I restored to it from my original iPad (1) backup.  I happened to be in the Photos app (on the new iPad) when I initiated the syncing of my photos.  When it completed, I noticed that all my albums were now there in the Photos app—that none had thumbnails.\nSolution (worked for me):\n1. quit Photos (tap-and-hold on any icon, wait for the \"jiggles\" and then tap on the red \"x\" for the Photos app).\n2. re-launch the Photos app.\n", "Q: What is the ⌥ key? Is this key the same as shift?\nIf so, why don't people just call it shift? I spent a long time looking around for what this key means. Google returned no results. My MacBook Air keyboard does not have this symbol either.\n\nA: The first symbol is the option key, located between the command and control keys on a typical Mac keyboard.\n\n\nA: That is the Option key (\nAlt on Windows).\nIt's not the same as Shift - it's generally used as a secondary modifier for keyboard shortcuts (Command ⌘ being the primary modifier) and for shortcuts that don't perform an action (e.g. Option-8 is a bullet point • and Option-Shift-8 is a degree symbol °).\n\nFrom the official \"macOS User Guide\":\n\n*\n\n*What are those symbols shown in menus on Mac?\n\n*Mac keyboard shortcuts\n", "Q: Does the iPad (2012, 3rd generation) have the most pixels of any tablet's display? I have heard this as a factoid from somewhere, and I'd like verification of it before I use it as a factual piece of information.\nThe new iPad (2012, 3rd generation) has a super high pixel count. Does this make for the highest resolution of comparable tablets on the market (i.e., those with similarly sized screens)?\n\nA: Due to the (good) edit of the question, the answer does not seem fit 100% anymore.\nNo.\n...which depends on what you define as a 'mobile device'. But first, the term resolution is ambiguously used which requires to answer your question in two ways.\nResolution as in pixel density\nThe iPad 3rd Generation has a pixel density of 264 pixels per inch (ppi). There are several other devices that provide higher pixel densities - the most well known to you is probably the iPhone 4(S).\nAs these belong to the mobile category, the answer is no.\niPad 3rd Gen                9.7\"    2048×1536   264\niPhone/iPod touch 4,4S      3.5\"    640×960     326\nRezound                     4.3\"    720×1280    342 (HTC)\nTouch Diamond, Touch Pro    2.8\"    480×640     286 (HTC)\nTouch Diamond2              3.2\"    480×800     292 (HTC)\nLG Optimus LTE              4.5\"    720×1280    329 (LG)\nLU1400                      2.8\"    480×800     333 (LG)\n\nYou can get a list of more devices here.\nResolution as in total pixel count\nThe display of the iPad 3rd generation is referred to as QXGA (2048×1536). There are several other devices that provide higher pixel counts - e.g. the Apple iMac.\nHowever, none of the following devices are 'mobile'. They provide higher pixel counts, but over a larger area. Hence, the answer is yes.\nSee this list of common resolutions for more devices. Note: Some of the resolutions stated there are only on paper - no devices implementing that resolution have been made yet according to the article.\nSony GDM-FW900 and Hewlett Packard A7217A   2304×1440    3,317,760\nDell UltraSharp U2711, Apple iMac (WQHD)    2560×1440    3,686,400\nDell Ultrasharp U3011 (WQXGA)               2560×1600    4,096,000\n\n\nA: For this answer, let's define that…\n\n…the sharpness of a display is the ability to distinguish two distinct pixels.\n\nRetina displays\nThere is no industry standard for retina display, therefore I'll follow Apple's use of the word. The term retina display is relative, as the definition follows the human eyes's perception of a display's sharpness:\n \nThe second picture means \"300 ppi is the limit of the human retina at a distance of 10 inch\"!\nWhile the iPhone 4S is commonly used at a distance of about 10 inches to the eye, the iPad  will be used at a larger distance - e.g. 15 inches. Therefore, the iPad can have a similar reception by the eye even though the pixel density is lower.\nPhysical background of 'retina'\nWhat does the formula mean? Let alpha be the angle at which the human retina will see two distinct pixels. d is the perpendicular distance to the display surface. h is the distance between two district pixels in one dimension.\nHence, we get:\n\n\nAs you can see in the table, the minimum angle at which the human eye can distinguish two pixels is larger than what it can see for both on the iPhone and the new iPad - at normal distances.\nThe perception of distinct pixels with the new iPad is even better than with the iPhone 4S. Apple is being fully reasonable when calling the iPad's display a retina display.\n\nNo other tablet can compete in similar measures for PPI and\ndisplay size of the iPad. It's even sharper then the iPhone in normal\nuse! It's the sharpest display on the market.\n\nOf course, this assumption is based on the fact that the displays are able to display any two pixels that are next to each other - which @checksum has pointed out in a comment.\nCompetitors\nAs mentioned in this answer, there are competitors with higher pixel densities, but not at the display size of the iPad 4G (9.7''). Furthermore, it's not clear to me if they are able to display each unique pixel like it IPS displays used by Apple can.\n\nA: Short answer: yes, in a way\nLong answer: the iPhone 4 is one of several devices with higher pixel density, often expressed in pixels per inch. But such screens are smaller, with a lower total pixel count.\nIBM notably released a ThinkPad some years ago with the same pixel count (aka QXGA) but at 15\", thus at a lower pixel density. Current monitors with even higher pixel counts are available, but at 27\" or 30\", even lower pixel density.\nThe \"bragging rights\" therefore are in creating higher-density screens at larger sizes, yielding lots and lots of super-sharp pixels.\nQualified in the \"mobile device\" category, there was nothing on the market with a higher pixel count when the third-generation iPad was released. And total pixel count is one of the ways people use the term \"resolution\"; density is the other.\n", "Q: Is the camera in the new iPad using \"4S optics\"? Apple's website merely identifies it as a \"5 megapixel iSight\" camera. MacRumors claims that Apple is reusing older parts. I recall reading that the new iPad has a better camera than prior models, so I'm confused. Which one is it? Advanced optics or not?\n\nA: No, the iPhone 4S has an 8mp camera.\nThe prior iPhone 4 had a 5mp camera though.\nBut, yes, the older iPad had a much worse camera - less than 1mp.\nThis would seem to show it's from the iPhone 4: The new iPad camera: we've seen it somewhere before\nMegapixels aren't everything - but the new iPad certainly has the best camera in an iPad so far.

Unfortunately the default Romaji layout for this keyboard in Kotoeri is set to \"US\".  I have checked the \"Kotoeri preferences\" section but the romaji layout selector does not have \"Japanese 106 key\" or anything like that listed.  It has a wide range of European layouts.\nThis is driving me nuts because, although the letters are in the same places, the punctuation on the Japanese layout is different, and after many years in Japan I've grown so used to programming with the Japanese layout that I can no longer touch type efficiently with the US one...  \nIf someone could point me to a way to add options to the kotoeri Romaji layouts I'd be very grateful!\n\nA: You can use the app Ukelele to fairly easily make a custom layout that puts the punctuation where you want it.\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/ukelele\nAfter making and installing a custom layout, you should be able to select it in the Kotoeri Preferences. \n\nA: There are two ways to do this:\n1: Check in kotoeri and see what kayboard map is showing.  If it's not set to Japanese, and you can't set it, then also check whether in the main language prefs (where you turn on Kotoeri) is US or any other selected non-Japanese language can be disabled.  If Japanese doesn't show in Kotoeri and English (or whatever) is grayed out in the language list and can't be disabled - then your system default keyboard has somehow become US English (or similar).  \nRe-run the setup assistant by doing the following:\nsudo rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone; \nsudo \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Setup Assistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Setup Assistant\"\nThen, select \"show all\" for countries, and pick Japan, then in the input page, select \"Kotoeri\", and it should enable Kotoeri with a Japanese keyboard layout by force.\n(I haven't tried doing this on a Mac with an English keyboard plugged in, though it does work over Screen Sharing!)\nYou can kill the setup assistant after that with ctrl-c in the terminal windows you started it from.\n2: If the above doesn't work, or seems too drastic for you, Install Google Japanese IME.  Then enable it, and from the language picker menu at the top of the screen select \"Preferences...\", and the Google Japanese IME preferences dialog should appear.  Go to the \"Advanced\" tab, and select \"Always use ja keyboard layout for Japanese input\".\nMethod 2 is better for a few reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*1. The login screen will still be on US layout for other people\n\n*2. It doesn't mess with system level settings (which may be changed when you plug/unplug keyboards?)\n\n*3. Google Japanese IME is much better than kotoeri anyway.\n\n", "Q: Where is my iPhone backup kept? (Created prior iOS5 upgrade) I've just updated my wife's 3GS to iOS 5.1 from iOS 4. The restore seem to only restore the messages/photo roll and some other settings. I don't see most of the apps but the most important part is the contacts are missing. This is why I'm looking for the iPhone backup that iTunes creates before updating the software. \nI currently have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iCloud\n\n*Turn on then off iCloud\n\n*Adding a Contact\n\n*Restoring from the last backup file(without timestamp)\n\n*Reset to Factory defaults and restoring\n\n*Copying from Sim (Has some older contacts, not the recent ones)\n\n*Using iBackupBot to browse the backups (only iOS5 backups seem to be there)\n\n\nHere are some other valid points:\n 1. The iPhone isn't regularly synced\n 2. I created a backup before updating the OS I can't find it anywhere now\n 3. There's no contacts on the Mac's Address Book.\n 4. There is only Sim contacts in the iCloud sync\n 5. iBackupBot shows me there are no other contacts other than the Sim ones that got synced to iCloud\n 6. There are existing SMS-es without Contact Names\n 7. I can try to correlate the SMSes with names but it will not give me the full contact list.\nSince the Messages are restored, the contacts must be kept somewhere can anyone help me? I'm pretty sure I just need to find the backup that was created for the Update and somehow grab all the contacts maybe using ibackupbot. \n\nA: If you are on WinXP - \nC:\\Documents and Settings/<user>\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\n\nIf you are on WinVista/Win7 - \nC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\n\nIf you are on MacOS - \n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n\nWith the above path, if you still can not find the iPhone backup location, you may try an application called \"iPhone Backup Unlocker\", it will help you recover lost backup for your iPhone.\n\nA: The backup location is here:\n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\nThat's the Library within your home directory.\nIn Lion it's hidden, so from Finder choose \"Go To Folder\" from the Go menu to get there.\nNot sure you'll find what you're looking for though. If you had it backed up to iCloud I would log into iCloud (http://www.icloud.com) to see if the info is there.\nDo you know if you were backing up to iCloud before as well, or backing up on the computer?\n\nA: Exactly because I have found myself in situations like this, I keep a backup of my iPhone contacts on my PC via Windows Contacts. In the future you can copy iPhone contacts to your PC with third party apps or via iTunes sync.\nThe location of your iPhone backup files made by iTunes is as follows:\nIf you are on WinXP - C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nIf you are on WinVista/Win7 - C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nIf you are on MacOS - ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\nIf you are trying to access your iPhone backup files with a third-party application, there are lots such of apps I believe one of them was called iPhone Browser.\n", "Q: Disk space not freed up after deleting files and emptying Trash I had approximately 50Gb of Windows VMs on my MacBook Pro internal SSD (128Gb) (OS X 10.7.3).\nI copied them to an external drive, then deleted them from the internal drive, then emptied the Trash.  \nWhen I look at disk usage in Activity Monitor it shows the same level of usage as it did prior to deleting 50Gb of files. \nAny ideas why the space hasn't been freed up?\n\nA: Launch the app System Information.\nThen select Window > Storage Management.\nThis will launch a utility designed for managing and observing storage.\nCritically, this screen seems to refresh the system disk space calculations. The free space shown in Disk Utility immediately went down.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206996\n\n\nA: The answer relates to changes to Time Machine backups in Lion.\nMy understanding is that when a TM back up is attempted when the back up disk is not connected, a back up is made in /Volumes/MobileBackups.  \nThese back ups do not go away the next time TM runs with the back up disk connected. I am not sure if the OS will eventually reclaim this space.\nYou can disable the local back ups by running one of the following commands (depending on your version of Mac OS):\nsudo tmutil disable localsnapshot\n\n# for older versions:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nAfter you run this command /Volumes/MobileBackups is deleted.\nI'm sure there is a good reason for the local backups and I don't necessarily recommend disabling them, but they were - in combination with some large deleted folders - the cause of disk space appearing to be still in use.\nYou can re-enable mobile backups by running:\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\n\nMore info here - http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/18\n\nA: On Mojave 10.14.4 I was able to reclaim 50GB of space with:\nsh-3.2# tmutil listlocalsnapshots /\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2019-04-03-103122\nsh-3.2# tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-04-03-103122\nDeleted local snapshot '2019-04-03-103122'\n\nLocal snapshots are typically created during Time Machine automatic backups. It is not clear why this local snapshot was created, because automatic backups are disabled on my Mac Book. One possibility is that Mojave upgrade automatically made that snapshot. \n\nA: Just switching off Time Machine in Time Machine Preferences (and switching it back on) fixed the problem for me.\n\nA: Sometimes the deleted content gets held in the .Trashes folder in the root directory. From the Terminal you can cd /.Trashes and see if any of your deleted files are still in the Trash. You can then remove them via sudo rm -rf someFolderName.\nCaution: this is a rather advanced user operation so be careful what you type and what exactly you remove since rm is permanent and can't be undone.\n\nA: If you look the free disk space from finder it will not include the backups on space used. That is because backups will be deleted if more space is needed by other apps. What I do to keep the mobile backups working without taking much space, is disabling and enabling the time machine once per week (from TM prefs). When you disable it the local backups are deleted.\nI guess it wouldn't make much difference to just let the drive get full and then automatically delete backups as needed (maybe slightly slower performance?).\n\nA: If you delete a file, as long as some application has a hold on it the file will not be freed from the filesystem. That's why you can play a movie and delete it while playing and still watch it until the end, presuming you don't pause it (which may even work too).\nThis is also perhaps why Time Machine related answers are popping up. If Time Machine is in the process of backing up your jumbo file that will take a good long while, and until it finishes the file will not be deleted from the system. You can \"Skip backup\" to resolve the problem immediately.\n\nA: This happened to me on Mojave, specifically with an APFS-formatted 512GB SSD with an extra volume besides the main one. After deleting many GB of files, almost no space would be freed. I don’t use Time Machine, and the handful of local snapshots I somehow had weren’t very large. Several other solutions also didn’t work.\nWhat worked for me was repeatedly adding and deleting a volume reserving nearly all the “available” space, which appeared to trigger updates to the APFS free space calculations. Note that this method only applies to APFS-formatted drives which use volumes rather than true partitions (and I suspect the problem is caused by some bug in APFS).\nDisclaimer: while this seemed to work for me without issues, it’s messing with fundamental parts of the system in a non-reversible way, and should be a last resort (also might not recommend for less technical users). Please do a full backup to an external drive before trying this.\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Select your main hard drive volume and take a note of the claimed available space\n\n*Click the + Volume button in the toolbar\n\n*Set the new volume’s reserved space to slightly under the supposed “available” amount of space (the max space and name don’t matter) and save\n\n*Select the new volume (double checking you’ve selected the right one!) and click - Volume in the toolbar to delete it.\n\n*Select your main volume again and you will probably see the “available” space has increased. Repeat the whole process several times until you no longer see space increases.\n\nNot sure if this was necessary but after completing this process, I ran disk first aid on the APFS container itself and the individual volumes.\n\nA: I not only had to remove TimeMachine local snapshots, but also thin local backups:\nI found a date in /Volumes/com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots/Backups.backupdb/MacbookPro\nThen I did:\ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots /  2021-10-27-121106 4\nThe command returns\nThinned local snapshots:\ncom_haystacksoftware_arqagent_12A...\n\nI got 5 GB back after this.\nI found the following explanation[1]:\nIf you are using macOS 10.13+ and the APFS file system, then the files you deleted may still exist within an APFS snapshot.   These APFS snapshots are used by macOS and  various backup utilities like Time Machine.   Many of these APFS snapshots will be automatically deleted after about a week or after TM sends the backup to the external TM drive.\nYou can examine the current APFS snapshots and try to thin or even delete them using this article as a guide https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/reclaiming-drive-space-by-thinning-apple-file-system-snapshot-backups/\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252030187\n\nA: On High Sierra the command will be: sudo tmutil disable localsnapshot.\n\nA: First try to restart your mac, then run the Disk Utility app. It will re-calculate your HD available space and show the correct numbers on Finder immediately\n\nA: This happened to me on Mac OS Catalina. I copied ~100GB from internal HD to external HD, deleted the 100GB on the internal HD. I allowed Time Machine to back up everything (internal and external). Still, the Finder shows no change in available disk space.\nWhat worked:\n\n*\n\n*I went to Apple Menu -> About This Mac.\n\n*I selected the \"Storage\" tab.\n\n*It calculated for a while, and kept increasing the available disk space until the numbers were correct.\n\nUnfortunately, the Finder was a bit \"more right\", but still off by quite a bit, even after several hours. After a while I rebooted (for an unrelated event), and when it came back the Finder was correct.\n\nA: I had a problem with similar symptoms. I deleted many GB and df -h showed no increase.\nIt turned up that this was due to Purgeable storage/Optimized storage feature in macOS (files that macOS deems suitable for removal). One can check it's size in Disk Utility by clicking on Info (it shows both Purgeable space and Free space). Both of these can be used for new files - system does delete those purgeable when needed.\n\nA: Had the same problem on MacBook Pro mid 2014. Did backups - nothing. FirstAid reported problems, repaired via Recovery, still space not claimed. Reinstalled MacOS via Recovery - free space increased from 24 to 120 GB.\nTaDa. Happy.\n\nA: If you have discovered that the issue is caused by snapshots as mentinoned in the other answers, and you use Carbon Copy Cloner, you can click on your volume in the sidebar on the left, then right-click on the snapshot and choose Delete from the contextual menu.\n\n", "Q: Does restoring from Time Machine also restore installed applications? I am planning to upgrade my late 2009 MacBook Pro (running Snow Leopard) by replacing the 250GB hard drive with a new 1TB drive. I have been maintaining Time Machine backups.\nI plan to install the new drive and do a fresh install of Snow Leopard and then restore using the Migration Assistant. This is my first time with Time Machine 'Restore' so two simple questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will restore, restore my OSX patches and installed applications?\n\n*Does Time Machine care if the new Drive is bigger than the original drive?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes - if you haven't excluded the /Applications folder from the Time Machine backups. \nAs for system patches - you're installing a new OS. Once you finish, load up the Software Update and it'll pull down the most recent Combo Update for you. Actually, it's better to use the combo update than a collection of patches you would have otherwise.\nFor more on this go to System Preferences → Time Machine → Options. It'll tell you what, if anything, you've excluded.\n\n*No. As long as you have sufficient space, you'll be fine. It doesn't need to be an identical drive.\n", "Q: Block an Application for a certain amount of time Is there any application or any way to make me unable to open a software on my Mac for a determined amount of time (a self-imposed block)?\nWhy this? It's a poker software, and when things are going bad I want to exclude me from play for a certain amount of time (like 2 hours) to prevent the \"tilt effect\".\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Try self control. It blocks websites rather than apps, but if you know where the app resolves to (I presume its online play) then you can block its access.\nNext best thing is willpower.\n\nA: In addition to the previous answer, a link where you'll find 6 apps to help you focus your work. It goes from fading out all apps you DON'T want to use (and highlighting the apps you are allowed to use) to completely blocking all apps/websites you don't want them to use. You can even protect the session with a password. \nSo I think you are quite save with these apps :)\n", "Q: Is VMWare Fusion bought through the MacUpdate Spring 2012 Bundle a full valid version? I'm considering buying VMWare Fusion 4. On vmware.com it's available for $49.99. MacUpdate is currently also offering a bundle which includes VMWare Fusion and 10 other apps, for a total price of $49.99 (MacUpdate Spring 2012 Bundle). I'm not particularly interested in any of the 10 other apps, but they might be nice to have. I'm wondering if there's a catch to this offer though. For example, I seem to remember that a similar bundle offered in the past didn't include the right to discounts when upgrading to future versions. So is buying VMWare Fusion through this bundle fully equivalent to buying it through VMWare.com?\n\nA: In addition to the answer of Diago, I got this from the MacUpdate FAQ :\n\nWhat's the catch? \nThere isn't one! You get the exact same versions of the apps as if you\n  paid full price! The same support, update, and upgrade options are\n  available to you, as well.\n\nSo, yes! Buying the spring bundle will give you a full valid version!\n\nA: Yes\nBundled software, specifically those sold by MacLegion and MacUpdate are 100% fully licensed versions of the applications. I bought Parallels 6 this way last year, and recently upgraded to 7 using the upgrade price without any issues.\nMacLegion and MacUpdate sell 4 bundles a year, and they spend a significant amount of time negotiating the deals with the companies that offer the bundles. Since they have build such a good reputation, they tend to come up with some very legit and good deals.\nUnless explicitly specified these are full licenses with no string attached. I have bought around 75% of the software I run this way, and one of the reasons I love owning a Mac.\nThese specials are Cyber Monday coming early. \nI can confirm that outside of MacLegion and MacUpdate, I have bought bundles where this is not the case, however, those were small, not as well known bundle suppliers, and the software clearly stated that they don't qualify for updates.\n", "Q: What happens to photos that you edit using iPhoto for iOS?

I know that one of the big innovations in the MacBook Air was in the battery (which gets most of the internal volume of the computer!)\nWhat is a normal loss of battery life (change in usable time on battery starting from a full charge) for a mid-2011 13\" MacBook Air? After how many charge cycles does one expect to see a substantial reduction in usable time? Is there any recommended course of action for someone to take to slow or reverse this degradation once it begins?\n\nA: I don't know what the expected life is (although the specs on the Apple website are always pretty accurate for me) - but of course it depends on your usage. \nAs far as I understand it, the MBA batteries are of a similar design to the MBP ones of the same generation. I always link to this page (which is on the Apple Discussions site) about preserving battery life - as I've followed it as closely to the letter as I can, and I still get a good 85-90% of the life out of my two-year old pro. I've quoted some below. \n\nDo’s & Don’ts\nDO use your battery frequently and lightly, ideally completing 1-2\n  charge cycles per week (minimum one charge cycle per month). \nDO properly calibrate your battery when new and approximately every\n  2-3 months thereafter.\nDON’T fully discharge your battery frequently (the infrequent,\n  periodic calibration is an exception). \nDON’T store your battery (or your computer) in a high temperature\n  environment, such as the trunk of a car, especially a fully-charged\n  battery.\nDON’T run your MacBook or MacBook Pro on AC power with the battery\n  removed.\n\nNote: I had a quick look and the pro and air batteries are the same material, so the above instructions will work well for them too.\n\nA: Battery Life\nApple's documentation states that the battery of the Macbook Air performs just like the batteries of the Macbook Pro:\n\n*\n\n*The built-in battery of your MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook Air is\ndesigned to deliver up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles before\nit reaches 80 percent of its original capacity.\n\n\n*In addition, Adaptive\nCharging reduces the wear and tear on the battery giving it a lifespan\nof up to 5 years.\n\n\n*During this lifespan the batteries will have a fast charge to 80% of the current battery capacity (2-3 hours). [source]\n\nBattery Maintenance\n\n*\n\n*Do not leave your Macbook plugged in all the time. The battery juices need to move from time to time. It's recommended that you charge and discharge the battery at least once per month.\n\n\n*Temperature: Keeping your Mac at room temperature (22°C/72°F) is ideal.\n\n\n\n*Long Term Storage: Apple recommends that you store the battery with a 50% charge, if you are not planning on using it for at least half a year.\nThe innovation in the design of the battery of the Macbook Air was not about increasing capacity, but about the ability to manufactures them very thin. The batteries of the Macbook Air are located towards the thin end of the Macbook Air.\n\nA: I believe this question will probably tell you a lot about the Macbook's battery.\nAnd, however this movie is about the 2009 MacBook Pro, the same technique is used in the 2011 MacBook Air. Which will allow you to charge your MacBook Air about a 1000 times before the battery is dead. (Which in that case, you probably could use it anyway, but not on the 8h lifespan)\n\nA: Based on my personal experience with my wife's MacBook Air 13\" i5, and my 11\" i5, I would say, on average (just browsing the web, typing, email, watch a few YouTube videos, etc.), the 13\" models will get 5-6 hours, while the 11\" models will get 3-4 hours.\nOne thing that has helped both of us keep getting an extra hour or two is the installation of FlashBlock in Chrome. Every time you load a site with flash ads or videos (besides YouTube), the fans go on after a minute, and processor activity jumps to 50-100%. Just leaving the window open, and doing nothing else, battery life is usually halved.\nI would dump flash altogether, but there are one or two sites I visit that only use flash for video :(\n", "Q: Creating a desktop shortcut to a file in the iCloud I have a MacBook with OS X Lion, and an iPad.\nI use IAWriter for keeping track of notes. In addition to standard file-based storage, it supports  live syncing using iCloud.\nI want to organize the files on my MacBook's desktop for quick access.\nHow do I create desktop links pointing to the IAWriter files in the iCloud?\n\nA: Apple's vision for iCloud seems to include isolating users from the confusion of the file system. iCloud files are accessed from within the application that created them–which is advantageous in some situations and a problem in others. \nTo use iCloud to share documents between iOS and MacOS you'll need to install iA Writer on both platforms. (Byword fans can now do the same).\nIf you want to use a different text editor, or editors, on your Mac, implement my (previous?–my test of the  Byword iCloud setup is working well so far) workflow that included a storage system using DropBox.\nI can't recommend this path because I haven't fully explored it, and it isn't officially supported by Apple, but if you're determined to create file aliases on the desktop, you might find a solution by exploring the folder ~/Library/Mobile Documents\n↬Kirk McElhearn: Make your own personal dropbox with iCloud\nNote that on the Mac I'm writing this from, the folder for my Byword documents did not exist within the Mobile Documents folder until I used the Open from iCloud… menu item. (I didn't have to load a file, just access the menu and allow the file requestor box a minute to populate.) Once the Byword folder existed, I was able to create an alias on the desktop that opens the file. I can also use the alias to Open with… TextMate but have not tested editing/saving the file using an alternative application Proceed with caution.\n\nA: If you click the share button for an iCloud document and choose Message, you can drag the document shortcut out of the resulting IM window and drop it onto the dock.\n", "Q: Can I make hot corners require a mouse click to be triggered?

We have several printers here at home, and I am thinking about enabling AirPrint. I'm not interested in driver hacks, since they often require a computer to be running with a shared printer.\nI am under the impression that there are devices that can be attached to a regular parallel or USB printer which will enable network printing. With this in mind:\nAre there any such devices that enable AirPrint? Are there even such wireless devices?\n\nA: Lantronix xPrintServer is a hardware device which can be plugged into your network to offer AirPrint services to iOS devices. I haven't used it myself, see ArsTechnica for a brief description:\n\nSimply plug it in to your home or office network, and every printer accessible on your local subnet—be it wired or wireless—will now show as an option when using AirPrint. There's no configuration necessary; any printer that supports JetDirect, LPD, or IPP printing will work, and that includes pretty much every printer with network support.\n\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but the Synology NAS has this capability to be an AirPrint Print Server \n\nA: The only one I am aware of is the Lantronix xPrintServer.\n\nxPrintServer fills the gap between the productivity of iPads and iPhones and the inability to print from those devices to office networked printers.\n\n*Bold by me\nUnfortunately it only works for networked printers.\nUsing a machine as a potential AirPrint server is at this point still the easiest way to enable this.\n\nA: Actually, the $99 \"home\" xPrintServer does support USB printers - up to 8 with a USB hub (not provided). It also supports 2 network printers, but they've just announced a $199 \"office\" product that supports unlimited network printers - though they recommend up to 10 for good performance.\n\nA: Make sure you go to the Lantronix site to ensure your printer is listed.  It doesn't work with the Canon MF4800 series. But they say it works with the Canon MF9000 series but I think that series already supports AirPrint natively since the MF6000 and MF8000 series do.\n", "Q: Can I download apps larger than 50MB while using Personal Hotspot? Can I download apps larger than 50MB while using Personal Hotspot? If so, isn't the limitation on iOS itself rather arbitrary? I can just use personal hotspot to download larger files to my computer and then sync them back over to my device.\nSo, is this possible?\n\nA: 2 x Yes :-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, it's possible to download apps (or anything else) larger than 50 MB when using the iPhone as a Personal Hotspot\n\n*Yes, the limit is arbitrary and probably mainly exists to reduce the load on 3G data networks\n\n\nA: That is perfectly possible.  The logic is as simple as \"If you are on your mobile carrier network, 50Mb is the max, but no limit for wifi\".  If your laptop connected over wifi it has absolutely no knowledge of this arbitrary limit and will happily ignore it.  The fact that it passes through your phone is of precisely zero interest to it and it won't know any better - neither will your phone have any clue what your laptop is doing.\nThe limit is I think one agreed to by carriers on the basis that if you are downloading on a phone you will be using your phone plan.  If you are using the hotspot feature, then chances are you are paying for the privilege and using a tethering plan.  Tethering plans are priced accordingly and you pay more simply for the fact that the expected usage is will be for larger files and bigger downloads or larger bandwidth activities etc.  Typically a phone plan is slightly better value than a tether plan because you are simply able to do less on your phone to rack up a huge bandwidth total, especially if they stick the odd arbitrary limit here and there (no 50Mb+ iTunes downloads, no FaceTime etc) thus allowing them to keep phone plans artificially lower than they might otherwise be (as evidences by the price of the tether plans in comparison)\n\nA: I have found that the limit does not apply if I connect my iPad to my iPhone through a personal hotspot, even thought he iPhone remains on the cellular network.  Makes the limit seem even more arbitrary.\n", "Q: What determines the \"special\" color of the status bar in SpringBoard?

Using personal hotspot, I'm seeing a blue. \nIs there any significance to the colors, or is this a totally arbitrary choice by Apple?\n\nA: As far as I have seen, the color is supposed to tell you a little bit about what is going on, or what app is active.\nVoice Memos is red, which is the color typically used for 'Recording'.\nCalls are green, which is the color of the Phone app's icon and is used in several places in the app (e.g., the Accept button).\nAirPlay is blue, which is the color that Apple typically associates with both wireless and music (AirPort and Bluetooth logos are blue, iTunes' icon is blue, the Remote app's icon is blue).\nPersonal hotspot is blue, which again is the color of 'wireless'.\n\nA: I suspect that there is nothing more to it than using colours that resemble the App icons for each function.  So phonecalls=green (green call icon), recording=red (Red for generic recording as used everywhere, and the icons design used to be red until it went blue...), and hotspot=blue(think Safari/Mail and other \"internet\" related icons colours, and also it's just different to the others and completes the RGB colour scheme...)\n", "Q: Can I use VNC over VPN on my new iPad? I've gotten an new iPad with 4G (yay!) and I've set up the VPN connection to connect to a VPN which I'd like to use to connect to my computer. However, I've noticed that my once VPN is on, my iPad doesn't do much except show an indicator in the status bar. \nIs it possible for me to connect to my iMac which is behind a firewall via VPN? Do I need an app to see my screen, or is there something which supports it on iOS \"out of the box\"?\n\nA: Yes - there are two ways to get through a firewall. So from the VPN perspective, you will want to be sure your client app and VPN pass bonjour packets so the remote iOS device can see the Mac that is advertising it's VNC screen sharing capabilities. AirPort hardware does a good job of proxying the VNC capabilities of sleeping macs and will even wake them up in response to incoming requests for screen sharing.\nNo - there is no iOS VNC client so your \"out of the box\" experience will involve going to the app store or otherwise installing an app like Screens or whatever other VNC app you prefer.\nI can speak for screens working in a mixed VPN / NAT port forwarding combined network where Lion server has configured the VPN and controls the AirPort. I do use the screens connect software and location service when I am not using VPN since that allows me to locate my macs similar to Back to My Mac does using iCloud. The screens solution really works well for me with or without VPN or needing iCloud integration. You don't need the screens connect in most cases when VPN is set up, but it's nice to have and doesn't interfere with VPN either.\n\nA: iOS does not have these features built in, unfortunately.\nThere are several VNC-apps on the App Store, RealVNC is one of them. As long as you have Screen Sharing enabled in the Sharing-preference-pane, any VNC-app will be able to connect to your iMac.\n", "Q: How do I stop my Mac from attempting Time Machine Backups? I have a 2005 PowerBook running 10.5.8 that, in its previous life, was my personal, full time machine that I used all the way through graduate school. It has been relegated to very light duty in the past year, and serves its purpose well. There is one minor annoyance that I'd like to get rid of, but have been unsuccessful so far. The problem is this: it is on most of the day, every day, and roughly twice per day I get a pop up window asking me to select a drive for Time Machine backups. Like I said, this used to be my full-time Mac, and I backed it up regularly so this seemed (at first) to be an artifact of its previous use/state. I do not need to back this machine up anymore and therefore do not need Time Machine on. I cannot get it to stop this behavior. Here is what I have done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Solution: turn off Time Machine backups via System Prefs. Outcome: no dice. \n\n*Solution: trash com.apple TM prefs file and restart the computer to reset TM to its default state. Outcome: no change. \n\n*Solution: Create a new user account to see if the problem persists. Outcome: it persisted. \n\n\nSo, I am out of solutions. This is a minor problem, as I simply dismiss the dialog box, but it is fairly annoying. Any takers?\n\nA: If you're referring to the nag when you plug in a new disk, you can try the defaults setting mentioned here:\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine DoNotOfferNewDisksForBackup -bool YES\n\nAlternatively, try decreasing the interval of backups to some insanely great number. Try the opposite of the setting listed as #26 on this page:\ndefaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 1800\n\nYou might try this to have TM prompt you once anually:\ndefaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 31449600\n\nYou might need to use sudo to apply these settings.\n\nA: How about using the following Terminal command:\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine DoNotOfferNewDisksForBackup -bool YES\n\n", "Q: Unwanted hollow star / album ratings foul up a Smart Playlist of zero-star songs The SXSW Showcasing Artist compilations typically include more than one thousand songs. When I add them to iTunes initially, the songs display a blank rating, which is what I want. \nThe songs are each tagged with the album SXSW YYYY Showcasing Artists (where YYYY is the year of the festival). They appear in coverflow view as more than one thousand distinct one-song albums, which is unwieldy. So, I gather them with a Smart Playlist, select all, open Get Info, set the album, year, sort album, and mark them \"Part of a compilation.\"  \nThen I start listening to them, and rating them one to five stars. In some cases, I do not need to listen all the way to the end in order to determine a rating, so the \"Played\" count does not increment. Sometimes the song plays all the way to the end and I can't rate it because I'm too busy. Sometimes a whole bunch of songs play to the end and I never hear them because the headphones were plugged in to the player but not to my ears. The only way I know I have actually heard enough of a song to be able to rate it is that it has a rating.\nThen, something happens. I don't know what.\nSome of the songs to which I have never listened show a two hollow star rating. I guess that's the Album Rating. What the heck? \nI want a Smart Playlist of the songs I have not rated yet, whether or not they have been played, and I do not want to count \"Album Rating\" as a rating. I want the zero-star songs, and the Album Rating makes the Smart Playlist think there are no zero-star songs.\nI would be delighted to remove the Album Rating, but there appears to be no way to do so within the iTunes GUI.\nI do not mind writing a program to remove Album Rating from wherever iTunes stores it, and based on Google searches such a tool would be popular. Is iTunes library format documented? Does iTunes generate Album Rating dynamically, so even if I were able to erase it from the disk, it would come back?\nNote: the technique \"View in Album List, click to the left of the leftmost star\" does not always work. See here and here.\n\nA: You can get rid of album ratings. Select \"as album list\" from the view menu, then click just to the left of the leftmost star. This will clear the rating, although you may have to try a couple times to hit the right spot, especially if you have 1/2 stars enabled. \nSource:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1786573?threadID=1786573\n\nA: You can click and drag any star rating to change it. Drag it all the way to the left to remove it.\nIn the newest version of iTunes, if the ratings you don't want are album ratings, go to Album view, click the album to expand it, and you'll see its rating (full stars) next to the album artist in the heading. Click and drag left to remove it and all the hollow stars for unrated tracks in that album should go away.\n\nA: I've been frustrated with this \"auto album starring\" problem for a long while, it totally mucks up smart playlists that are based on track ratings. After I migrated my full collection of 14k+ songs recently, I just had to do something about it.\nSo after much looking for tools, I found this awesome collection of AppleScripts for iTunes on Doug's Scripts. I even found an AppleScript at http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=albumratingreset that would set the album rating to anything I wanted, exactly what I was looking for! I tried it out, but the script was written with specific code to only allow 1 track selection at a time, and here I wanted to reset my entire library.\nI have no AppleScript skills whatsoever, but I managed to hack together a working script that would handle multiple tracks. I've successfully reset my manually applied album ratings (which was the original problem, for me). I've put up the gist on github, here: https://gist.github.com/dhiraj/5093759\nPlease understand that I'm a first time AppleScript author, (always wanted to, but never had enough incentive) so there may now be glaring bugs, problems or other things that go boom in this, use at your own risk and understanding. Do comment if it works for you and what you used it for, if you do use it - I'm very interested. :)\nOh, and in case you're stuck, wondering what to do with the .scpt file you get, head on over to the first URL above and read through the README PDF file.\n\nA: Easy way to do it is find the artist and check that or the album isnt rated with stars, I had this problem for years, until just now when i noticed the artist had a 5 star rating, I changed that and WHAM problem gone\n\nA: This happens when your Album is rated with non-hollow stars. This will automatically rate the non-rated songs from that album with hollow stars.\nThe quickest way I found to change this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*On Songs View, teak your view to see the Album Ratings. (Right-clicking on the column names and selecting Album ratings from the list)\n\n*Sort it from the higher to the lower ratings or whatever sorting gives you more non-hollow album ratings. \n\n*Click on the left side of the first star (not in the actual star). It will probably disappear from your sight - This happens because it was sorted where is it supposed to be, to begin with.. lol\n\n*Repeat for all other non-hollow rated albums. \nThis will made your album rating become hollow if you have any rated song on that particular album. If you don't have any song already rated for that album, it will just become unrated (album and respective songs)\n\nA: Fortunately a smart guy wrote a script, which:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fixes tracks with \"hollow star\" ratings\n\n*Prevents iTunes from assigning \"hollow stars\" on any unrated songs\n\n\nThe script works by setting the rating of unrated songs - including those with hollow stars ratings - to 1%, which is below 1 star and displays as unrated in iTunes.  It works as expected with smart playlists selecting on track rating.\nYou can run it safely against your entire library (obviously, do a backup first!); it leaves alone any track that has an actual rating.\nThe script is part of an extensive library that helps work around iTunes idiosyncrasies (look for ClearTrackAutoRating).  These are vba scripts for Windows boxes; I think there is a (possibly less polished) Mac version by the same helpful chap here (not tested). There's another script - ClearAlbumAutoRating - which  prevents the weird auto-rating of entire albums if that annoys you too.\nThe only drawback to this approach is that it only works on track which are part of your iTunes library when you run the script; ie: you'll need to keep running it as your library expands but it's no biggie.\n\nA: Found an easy way!  I am running 12.6 under Windows\nFrom the menu\nselect Edit ->  Preferences\nthen UNclick \"show Apple Music features\"\nYou will see almost all the grey stars disappear. Only about 5% stick around, but I can deal with those numbers.  \nI then went to the ones with grey, move them to 1; it then turns blue.\nThen to whatever rating I want, I put them in my selected play list.\nI to use the \"rating\" to identify if I have placed a song in a playlist or not.\n\nA: Only songs that are part of an album that was explicitly rated, \"solid stars\", will show up in a smart playlist based on ratings. To remove unwanted tracks from your playlist that are listed because of album rating do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the playlist\n\n*Play a song with that is implicitly rated \"hollow stars\"\n\n*Right click on the album graphic at the top of Itunes and select (go to album)\n\n*Click to the left of the first star next to the heart in the album area\n\n*Now check your playlist and all the songs that were implicity added from that album to your playlist will be removed from the playlist.\n\n\nA: A brute force way is to delete the song from your iTunes library, BUT NOT delete the song from your computer.  Then add the song again to your library.\n", "Q: 'Matrix Mode' for surround sound output? I recently invested in a digital surround sound system, and have been enjoying digital surround sound through the TOSlink port of my Macbook Pro (Mid 2010 and Late 2011 models). However, I've noticed that when I'm playing two-channel sound (for instance, spotify), three of my five speakers are silent.\nI used to have Logitech X-540's which have a 'matrix mode' which splits sound out over all the speakers. Is there any way to duplicate or partially duplicate this functionality with my Mac?\n\nA: Unfortunately, Mac OS X has fairly limited multi-channel audio support.  It can stream already-encoded Dolby Digital or DTS audio from a DVD (and programs like VLC can do this from other file formats) but it doesn't provide a means of expanding stereo sound to more channels.  Futhermore, Toslink only has enough bandwidth for uncompressed stereo or Dolby/DTS-encoded multi-channel, so you'd need to encode the audio to one of these formats on-the-fly -- this is another feature Mac OS X lacks.\nIt's generally up to your audio receiver to provide a means of expanding stereo sound to utilize multiple speakers.  Does your digital surround system have an option for Dolby Pro Logic or DTS Neo?  These are other popular algorithms for expanding two-channel sound to multiple speakers.\n", "Q: Is there an Apple list of terminal based tweaks? Googling for terminal tweaks shows sites this one which show how to tweak OS X via the Terminal.

But with iTunes in the cloud and iTunes Match this isn't as big a deal. So I figured I'd move my library to my Time Capsule.\nHowever, now that I've moved it, I'm unsure how to watch and listen to the media from my iPhone. Is there any way to start Home Sharing from the Time Capsule, or are there any apps that are designed to play iTunes libraries from NASs?\n\nA: For the Time Capsule directly? No\nSharing is done via iTunes running, irrelevant of where the files are stored. However you can look at something like Subsonic to share the music with multiple devices.\nIn both instances however this needs to run off another machine connected to the time capsule.\n", "Q: How can I look inside iOS apps' folders from within iTunes? When looking at an app's documents with iTunes (in the Apps tab of the iDevice), it is possible to view folders of the documents created by the apps. How can I look inside them? Double-clicking does nothing.\nHere's a screenshot showing what I mean:\n\nI'd like to avoid saving the folder, viewing it in the Finder, changing it, and re-downloading it to the iPad.\n\nA: You cannot using iTunes, however products such as PhoneView allow you to browse inside folders under the App and transfer files also, all outside of iTunes.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no way. The list is simply a container with a list of files/folders that can be sent between the two devices. The files themselves are stored on the source, and only actually moved once you save them, or sync, depending on the direction.\nIn short, it's a plist saved with a simple link to the files/folders, which is then retrieved when you perform an action. As far as I know, not even files can be opened directly from there without downloading them first.\nIn all seriousness, have you considered Dropbox as a medium for this?\nP.S.: Double-clicking should allow you to rename, or it does on my version of iTunes.\n", "Q: How can one reset the tutorials that run for preinstalled OS X apps on first run? I'll give a bit of back story so this makes more sense:\nI was pre installing and configuring some stuff for a family member's new Mac mini. It was shipped to my place so they haven't ever used it and in the process of setting things up I had to run iTunes and other included apps.\nThe first time you run them, they open up a pop up that guides you though basic usage. How can I reset that before I hand it to them, so they see the tutorial when they first run the app?\nThere are also some non-Apple programs, like Office 2011 and Spotify, which I would like to do this for. So any general pointers that could help with that would be appreciated.\n\nA: I'm not sure this are the movies you are referring to, but Apple has made a lot of useful tutorials about using a Mac. From beginner to some more experienced...\nYou can find them on the Apple website.\nAnd to answer your other questions, you can find extensive documentation and how-to's about Spotify and Office for Mac on their websites.\n\nA: In most Apple apps that have first-run tutorials, you can still access them through the Help menu. For example in iTunes there is Help -> iTunes Tutorials, and in iPhoto there is Help -> Welcome to iPhoto.\nTo get them to show on launch again, I think you will have to edit the preferences files for each application. This is a pain because they don't implement this in a consistent manner.\nAll the preferences are located in ~/Library/Preferences. The library in your home folder is hidden by default in Lion, so you will have to use one of the many methods to show it.\nIt's different for each app, but here's an example. In com.apple.iWork.Pages.plist change\n<key>dontShowWhatsNew</key>\n<true/>\n\nto\n<key>dontShowWhatsNew</key>\n<false/>\n\nNumbers and Keynote are similar but uses <integer>1</integer> that should be changed to <integer>0</integer>. iPhoto has the same key, as well as <key>FirstLaunch</key>, but changing them doesn't seem to work.\nIf you can't find the necessary key, deleting the plist file will often work. This won't break anything, but be warned that you will lose any custom preferences for that app.\n", "Q: How to watch air broadcasted TV with VLC Player on a Mac I want to watch my air broadcasted TV with VLC Player on a Mac.\nI have a standard European TV connection (free air-broadcasted TV), and I would guess I need some sort of USB TV tuner to connect the antenna cable to my Mac.\nCan I just buy any USB TV tuner, or do I need to get anything specific?\nCould you give me an example of device I need to buy? I'm not asking for suggestions about what to buy, but just an example to define the category.\n\nA: Do you have any particular reason for needing to use VLC?\nIf you don't you could try EyeTV as it supports a good range of tuners (mine is a miglia) and has a streaming app for the iPhone / iPad \nhttp://www.miglia.com/\nhttp://www.elgato.com/\nElgato also do network aware tuners\n\nA: No the apple TV isn't a tuner, just a media streaming device (the original one also had a hdd to store files)\n", "Q: How does H2O Wireless work with the iPhone without needing any unlock? My friend purchased an iPhone 4 that cannot be unlocked so the store sold him a new cell phone service called H2O Wireless. You simply pop in the sim card and it works without needing any unlock or chip. Does anybody have a clue on how it works?\n\nA: H₂O doesn't provide a network of its own. Instead, it purchases bandwidth in bulk from a carrier, in this case AT&T, and provides prepaid service using the carriers network.\nSo your friends phone isn't unlocked, but works just fine on the carrier network that its locked to.\n", "Q: Is there a 'non-destructive' way to make mix cds in iTunes?

I was comparing the Twitter web app to the native app, and noticed a couple of differences in how they perform. I observed that scrolling was not as smooth in the browser as the native app, among a few other minor quirks. I believe the web app could perform just as fast if not faster in the web app version, so its hard to me to understand the difference. I believe WebKit is baked right into the core of iOS.\nApple initially wanted to keep it as web apps only, but now I wonder if their focus shifted more towards native. \n\nA: The focus shifted from WebApps to Native when the App Store was unveiled with the release of the iPhone 3G with iOS 2.0.1, which was introduced on June 9, 2008 at the WWDC.\nInitially Web Apps were intended to be used with the first iphone, but the major shift took place with the release of the dedicated iOS (or iPhone OS as it was called then)  Software Development Kit announced at the iPhone Software Roadmap event on March 6, 2008. The SDK allows developers to create applications using Xcode that will natively run on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.  Even prior to that, the included applications were written natively despite the fact that Steve Jobs once remarked:\n\nThe full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web\n  2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly\n  like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with\n  iPhone services. They can make a call, they can send an email, they\n  can look up a location on Google Maps.\nAnd guess what? There’s no SDK that you need! You’ve got everything you need\n  if you know how to write apps using the most\n  modern web standards to write amazing apps for the iPhone today. So\n  developers, we think we’ve got a very sweet story for you. You can\n  begin building your iPhone apps today.\n\nThe difference is as simple as that age old difference between \"interpreted\" and \"compiled\" applications.\nNative apps are written using lower level languages (Objective C, C, C++ using Xcode development environment) and are compiled against APIs that are designed to extract maximum speed and efficiency using algorithms and functions that are written specifically against the hardware they are intended to be run on.  Compiling code into directly executable machine code almost always the fastest method of execution for a given software task.\nWebApps are generic uncompiled pieces of code that are not able to make use of these APIs and have to either recreate them or not use them.  They are written in lower level languages such as Javascript, Python, or Perl and they are interpreted via a runtime environment at the point of execution, which allows for a certain flexibility at the expense of raw speed.  The scrolling function is one example of where the native app has access to highly optimised routines to allow super slick scrolling, but a webapp doesn't because it has no knowledge of or access to the relevant APIs.  Many web-apps are compiled on the fly using 'just in time' compilation techniques, but whilst this can gain some speed improvements it cannot cater for the lack of a proper optimised API platform at a higher level language then Javascript (which is the only client side runtime that iOS actually supports, although other OS, mobile and desktop may have access to others) that iOS webapps are written in.  Other runtimes are available for use so long as they perform server side, which provides a further performance hit.\nIn the specific case of Twitter, the twitter app is simply not using webkit, it's using other routines written in objective C which are again (the key word I suppose) optimised for the best results in a way nothing in a browser can achieve.  Oddly, I think the Facebook native app is actually a thinly veiled wrapper around a webkit UI.\n", "Q: Syncing photos doesn't appear to do anything I have a ton of photos on my iPhone (4S, although most were taken with my previous 3G). I am trying to sync them to my computer (Windows Vista) but they are not appearing there.\nI went to my iPhone in iTunes, clicked the \"Photos\" tab at the top and selected a folder. After synching, that folder now has a subfolder \"iPod Photo Cache\" with one file \"Photo Database\" that is 892 bytes.\nWhere are the photos? Do I need to do something different to actually copy the photos to this folder?\n\nA: The \"photos\" tab in iTunes is for syncing photos on your computer to your iPhone. To download the photos off your iPhone, use some software that downloads photos off cameras, such as Windows Photo Gallery.\n", "Q: What is the best RDP/VNC client for the new iPad that makes use of the retina display? I am looking for a remote desktop client to connect to both my Mac and PC. I would prefer not to install any software on the remote computers and just take advantage of the built-in protocols. What are some of the best remote desktop apps that you have tried?\n\nA: Screens by edovia supports retina resolution on the iPad from day one for the iPad and works well on iPod touch, iPad and iPhone for quite some time.\nHere are pictures showing the same desktop in retina and then non-retina iPad screen captures.\nRetina:\n\n\nNon-Retina:\n\n\nOddly, when you zoom in to the maximum zoom level (and you will likely need to expand these pictures if you are not viewing them on a retina display or they get down sampled to render on this site), the non retina iPad anti-aliases text a bit better than the retina iPad where you can really see the anti aliasing. This is similar to scanning print magazines where a lower resolution is often better for digitizing the \"human perception\" and not the \"reality\" of halftone screen details in process color printing.\n\nA: I use an application called iRemoteDesktop. It's fairly inexpensive, uses native RDP and works perfectly for PC. I haven't used anything for Mac thought, since I have no need to remote to my Mac's.\nAs for supporting Retina displays, I am guessing most of these will be updated in the coming weeks, keep in mind, the new iPad was only released last week.\n", "Q: Screen Sensitivity of the retina display iPad (3rd generation). Is it better than before? Does the new iPad support higher resolution tapping, or just more pixels for display. Stylii and the existing iPad feel like writing with a big marker on a big index card. Will the new iPad feel more like pen-and-paper when using a stylus?\n\nA: I practice, I can't tell any difference at all between the two models for most finger gestures on non-drawing apps.\nTwo things make this measurement hard - we don't get to see the raw pressure points and the unsmoothed and smoothed multitouch input. The end result of touch is highly processed which could easily hide changes in the detection grid / chip that does the processing / algorithms or tuning to make one iPad feel like the others.\nThe other is that our fingers cover the area we are selecting and for fine adjustments, you don't have to actually move your finger - just roll it to change the contact area of your deformed finger pad area that is either in direct contact or close proximity to the glass surface. \nOnce I learned to pivot and wiggle my fingers in place rather than try to slide it for fine adjustments - my precision (and feel of being able to control the precision) jumped immensely.\nOn the other hand - drawing with a stylus or deft and rapid strokes with a finger in a good drawing program makes the end feel on a retina iPad much better than before. I don't know if this is mental or real, but getting a finer line out of the same repeated gestures is incredible and makes the new hardware feel much more like pen or pencil and paper to me. I can't tell if it's the CPU/GPU or hardware or illusion, but the feel is quite real after a short adjustment period.\n\nA: Only if you file your fingers down to double precision ;)\nBut seriously, no, the actual capacative touch screen layer is unchanged, because the thing that is needs to interact with (your finger) remains unchanged.\nTo take a simple drawing application as an example, drawing a spiral will receive input from your fingers in the same way as on an iPad or iPad 2.  It takes the locations of your touch and tries to take an average of the \"centre\" of your touch point and this will produce the same results, although when translated into your drawing the enhanced resolution allows the touch algorithm to smooth out the centre area to a slightly more accurate level which may result in a more accurate looking drawing, but it's not due to any resolution changes in the touch sensitive layer, just a more accurate rendering of the existing input.\n\nA: There is definitely a difference in screen touch sensitivity between the iPad Retina and the iPad 2. The former has a harder feel and is less sensitive to the touch.

I'm looking to be able to select the current word my text cursor is inside on OSX (10.7.3). \nFor people who have used vim before, I want to be able to do a similar thing to the 'ci_' command, where '_' can be 'w', '(', '[', etc. to specify deleting the word or contents of a parens/bracket and enter insert mode.\nThe best way I've figured to do this is Option+Left then Shift+Option+Right to first navigate to the left end of the word, then select to its right end.\nIs there a way I can create a macro to do both of these at once?\n\nA: This has been covered in a screencast on the Ask Different Blog. I encourage you to watch the video, but I'll summarize here.\nFirst, create a little AppleScript that presses the two keyboard shortcuts.

What are the pros and cons, performance-wise, of enabling and using FileVault? Is there any at all, or does it slow a computer down significantly or on the contrary speed it up? Also, what effect will it have on Time Machine-backups (performance-wise)?\n\nA: This depends to a large extent on your hardware.  Filevault essentially encompasses 2 major elements:\nEncryption\nCPU bound, the faster your CPU, the quicker the OS can encrypt and decrypt the data on the disk.  Filevault uses 256 bit encryption, so it's a fairly meaty process\nI/O\nOnce stuff is encrypted (or before it can be decrypted) is needs to be read from or written to disk.  The difference between an SSD and traditional spinning platter media is enormous.  What might be a slow decryption process could be made up for using lightening fast access.\nSo, really it depends on all sorts of things, and how they can affect the above.  You don't list hardware, so that makes it near impossible to gauge.\nAnecdotally, as it's the only measure I have to hand, I have had Lion installed on a 1.6Ghz Macbook Air with SSD both with and without Filevault.  In use it booted marginally slower, but I had to time it (I forget the timings, but it was of the 15% slower mark or so) but in use I could see no discernible difference.\nAssuming you have a USB Time Machine disk, I would say the impact will be non-existant, as it's highly unlikely that any affect on performance would take it down to below your normal USB performance.\n\nA: CPU load\nFilevault 2 supports Intel® Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It's important to know if your Mac has an Intel processor which supports this, as it significantly reduces the CPU overhead. Search for you CPU here an look if is supports the New AES instructions.\nMy Macbook Pro 2011 got this feature enabled via a firmware update (Apple did not enable this with the newly shipped MBP). With AES encryption acceleration, the performance drop with Filevault 2 enabled is almost unnoticeable during normal usage. The maximum read speeds of my SSD only dropped from 510MB/s to 490MB/s.\nArs Technica, published an extended review on Filvault 2 in Lion. They say:\n\nApple also leverages the special-purpose AES instructions and hardware on Intel's newest CPUs, further reducing the CPU overhead. The end result is that regular users will be hard-pressed to notice any reduction in performance with encryption enabled.\n\nAs the overall CPU load is nearly unchanged, the battery life is not affected significantly.\nTime Machine Backups\nIf you backup up wirelessly (unencrypted) or locally (encrypted, USB) the performance of Time Machine will not be affected significantly.\n\n*\n\n*First, because the of the AES acceleration mentioned earlier.\n\n*Secondly because Time Machine creates local backups (snapshots). OS X Lion compensates for the potentially unavailable external disk by keeping an additional backup locally on the primary hard drive. This has its obvious advantages, since you can restore to past Time Machine backups right away from anywhere.\n\nI've been using Filevault 2 encryption on a MBP 8,2 for three months.\n\nA: (I'm assuming you are referring to FileVault 2 found in OS X Lion)\nThe folks at AnandTech have run some performance benchmarks on the new FileVault.  Quote:\n\n... [described are several I/O tests with and without FileVault enabled, including some charts you might want to have a look at] ...\nOverall the hit on pure I/O performance is in the 20 - 30% range. It's\n  noticeable but not big enough to outweigh the benefits of full disk\n  encryption. [...]\n\n[emphasis above is mine]\nSo to answer your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*FileVault slows I/O down, and it is a measurable decrease in performance.  However, I agree with the earlier quoted statement – in that the added security is beneficial, and I use FileVault on my Macbook Air.\n\n*The answer on the second question is \"it depends\".  The TimeMachine backup process must certainly read a lot of data from the FileVault-encrypted disk, so the reading portion of the backup will be slower.\nHowever, whether or not the overall backup performance suffers considerably depends on where the bottleneck is in the system – e.g. is it a very fast backup drive, or a very slow backup drive? Is it connected by USB (slower), or Thunderbolt (faster)? If the write speed is terrible, that will govern the overall speed of the backup, not so much the read speed having been reduced a bit.  Ergo, it depends.\n", "Q: How to sync Iphone on laptop with music collection on desktop? I would like to use my laptop as the syncing point for my iPhone, but I don't like having my music collection on the laptop. Is there a way I can sync my iPhone with my laptop and still be able to add music files to the iPhone while maintaining my music on the desktop?\nI have a Macbook Air as laptop and a Mac mini as desktop. The Mac mini is my current sync point for both my iPhone and my music collection.\nCan I share the music folder on the desktop via NFS and mount it on the laptop?\n\nA: I dont know about mounting the folder but You can add all the music to the laptop and iTunes, Sync the phone, and once it has fully synced, you can then delete the files from their location, do not delete them in or from iTunes, just the iTunes folder.\nNow when you sync again, the iPhone will not try to sync songs as they are already synced and you do not have any music files on the laptop.\n\nA: If you are running iOS 5, a new feature actually allows you to do the Wifi sync between multiple computers, just with different types of content. \nYour process may be slightly more difficult because you want to have mostly everything sync from a new computer. This will be a lot easier to explain/walk through if you were almost starting from scratch on the iPhone, or just adding a new syncing device. So for some preliminary work, you will at least need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are using iOS 5\n\n*Have iTunes 10.5 at least installed\n\n*Make sure you are ok possibly loosing backups. Since this is complicated now (iCloud vs iTunes backup, etc), its really outside the scope. \n\n*Are ok using Wifi Sync\n\n*Make sure that your MacBook Air has the content you want to sync to the device on it.\n\n\nAt this point, im assuming the above has been done. \n\n\n*\n\n*On the Mini, plug in the iPhone and make sure Wifi Sync is enabled. Also disable all other content sync except for music.\n\n*Unplug from Mini, and plug into a charger (just to be safe) and test wifi syncing.\n\n*Make sure the sync is fully complete on your Mini.\n\n*On your Air, the iPhone should now show up, as long as they are on the same network. \n\n*Setup sync on the MacBook Air, and select the content that you wish to sync (as in, everything except music).\n\n*Click Apply, so the sync starts. \n\n\nAt that point, you should be done. On the iPhone, if you go to Settings -> General -> iTunes Wifi Sync, it should now show the Mac Mini syncing music, and the MacBook Air syncing apps/photos/etc. I also had to restart my phone for this to show up correctly. \n\nThere is a little more information available at http://macmost.com/forum-how-do-i-sync-my-ios-5-device-with-multiple-libraries.html\nAs for your final question, yes, you could mount your iTunes Music from your Mini on your laptop, but iTunes on the laptop would need to have its own library, and using multiple libraries like this is rather complicated and dangerous. It can easily lead to confusion if you delete something from one library, because it won't be removed from the other.\nTo share the folder, go to System Preferences, Sharing, and select File Sharing. Then you can either drag the music folder to the first list, or click the '+' to add the folder. \n", "Q: How much RAM can I add to my macbook I have a 2008 macbook with a 2.1 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.\nI am in the process of upgrading to Lion.\nI currently have 2GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\nWhat's the maximum amount of RAM I can put in and it have an effect? \n\nA: everymac.com is an awesome source for this kind of information. They've got detailed specs for all Macs.*\nYours is listed as supporting a maximum of 6GB of RAM. Technically, Apple says that this computer only supports 4, but it has been proven to actually support 6:\n\nApple officially supports a maximum of 4 GB of RAM but third-parties\n  have been able to upgrade the system to 6 GB of RAM using one 2 GB and\n  one 4 GB memory module.\n\nYou can buy a 6GB kit from OWC, a great company, for $120.\nIf you use a lot of apps and regularly run up against the edge of your available memory, everything you add will make a difference; the computer can take advantage of all of it. However, since you've currently got 2, you should consider if 4 will be enough or if you want all 6.\n*In additon to Everymac, I recommend the app Mactracker for Mac and iOS (free). It has detailed info and specs for all Mac models.\n\nA: Your Macbook supports up to 6GB of RAM.\nApple states that it's 4GB, but OWC continuously checks the max. supported RAM of Apple's computers.\nSee this list here:\n\n\nA: It officially supports 4GB of RAM, but has been reported to actually take 6GB. Lion is a 64-bit OS, and will use all of the RAM you give it.\n\nA: If I'm right and that's your MacBook Model then the maximum is 4GB.\nAnd if it does have an effect or not depends how much free memory you have now. But usually it's a good thing to upgrade if you use the latest OS X versions.\n", "Q: Audio setup for Macbook and XBox? I have a one set of speakers, 2 macbooks (girlfriend and I), an iPod touch and a XBox.\nNow, I struggle with the audio because anytime I want to listen music or use the xbox, I have to switch the RCA cables plugged into the speakers.\nIt seems that Airport Express could be a solution and airplay seems really nice, but I don't know how/if it will work with the XBox?\nDo you see a solution to simplify that situation?\n\nA: You are right that the AirPort Express would work for the iPod and Macs. It won't, however, work with the Xbox. For that, I recommend getting a little RCA switch and RCA-minijack adapter. Using the adapter, plug the AirPort's audio out into one of the input ports of the switch. Plug the Xbox another input port. Plug the speakers into the switch's output end.\nWhen the switch is set to the AirPort's input, you can AirPlay music. When the switch is set to the Xbox's input, you'll hear sound from your Xbox.\n", "Q: Insert code blocks in the body of emails I'm a developer, and I'd like to be able to distinguish blocks of code from regular text, when I write emails. \nBasically I wanna be able to do this. In the Mail app, (or Sparrow!).\n\nIs there a way to do this with a shortcut, or macro, etc so that I don't have to reach for the mouse every time and change like 20 font attributes?\n\nA: Assuming you're comfortable sending HTML mail you could use Markdown to format your email message and create an automator service to convert, render and replace your markdown with formatted text.\nᔥ Ryan Gray: Markdown Compose for Mac OS X Mail\n\n[W]hat I had to do was to save the HTML generated from the Markdown conversion to a temporary file, then open that in Safari, have Safari select all and copy to the clipboard (copying an HTML object), then having Mail paste it – replacing the selected Markdown text. So, the service workflow takes the selected text, but does not itself replace the selection directly.\n\nInstructions for creating this service are provided in the article. \nIn addition to providing an explicit path to the markdown.pl file in your Automator script, be certain that you make markdown.pl an executable file.\nchmod a+x your/path/to/markdown.pl\n\nNote: With the demise of Posterous, the original link to Ryan Gray's article broke. I've edited the answer to point to a version archived at The Internet Archive Wayback Machine. ↬Dominique for bringing the broken link to my attention. \n\nA: The magic behind the formatting on StackExchange is a great perl script called Markdown.

This will only work if your mail messages are set up as Rich Text -- if you have plain text mail messages, running this service will simply erase the contents of your message, as your rich text formatted by the service will not be able to be pasted.\n\nA: You can install Markdown Service Tools and then follow the instructions by Tobias O’Leary. Recommended!\n\nA: I know this one is a little old -- so here is an update of sorts.  I had a hard time getting that answer's shell script to work correctly.\nI had installed Markdown via brew.\nOn the shell script \"Pass input:\" set to \"as arguments\".  I had success with this variation on the shell script:\n/usr/local/bin/markdown <( echo \"$1\" ) | /usr/bin/textutil -stdin -stdout -convert rtf -format html | /usr/bin/pbcopy\n\nThe AppleScript remained the same.\n\n\nA: I use a shell script like this:\necho \"<style>\n$(cat /Applications/Marked.app/Contents/Resources/swiss.css |\nsed 's/&/&amp;/g;s/</\\&lt;/g;s/>/\\&gt;/g')\n</style>\n$(cat | pandoc --strict -p)\" |\ntextutil -stdin -stdout -inputencoding UTF-8 -format html -convert rtf |\nLC_CTYPE=UTF-8 pbcopy\n\npandoc --strict -p acts like Markdown.pl and preserves tabs.\n-inputencoding UTF-8 is required to preserve non-ASCII characters.

All of the songs on my work computer have ratings.\nHow can I transfer the ratings from the work computer to the home computer without destryoing or replacing the home computer's library?\n\nA: I got it working in the end by using a hint I found.\n\n\n*\n\n*The trick is to make playlists per rating. One for 1 star, one for 2 star items, etc.\n\n*Drag all 1 star items into the 1 star playlist. Same for 2-5 stars.\n\n*Export the playlist/library (this results in an XML file).\n\n*Import the XML file on the other computer.\n\n*Go to each of the playlists, select everything, right click and give them all the correct rating.\n(In case you have a backup .xml file that you want to use to restore ratings to your existing itunes installation: look at my description plus script where I use the exactly same trick, only with a script based on an old .xml file with the correct ratings)\nCouple of improvements on this great simple solution (the best kind):\n1) The exported XML contains the exact file location for each song.  Therefore each computer must also have the files in those same locations. You can, of course, edit the XML accordingly if they are different.\n2) You can use 5 smart playlists (one for each number of stars: 1-5) and they'll be auto-populated (no manual selection and dragging required).\n\nA: There is no simple way of achieving this for free. But there are a few apps that sync iTunes libraries and meta data across computers:\n\n\n*\n\n*SuperSync\n\n*TuneRanger\nSyncopation is a software I used some time ago, but I don't remember it syncing the ratings.\n\nA: A very easy solution is iTunes Match. It will cost you $24.99 a year, but it sync almost anything in your iTunes library across your devices. Ratings, play counts, songs, albums, cover art,...\nAnd you can hook up to 10 devices, so it will definitely fit your needs!\n", "Q: What happens, exactly, when an iPhone app is run on an iPad at 2x scale? When I run an iPhone app which supports retina displays on an iPad, does it have increased clarity when shown at 2x size? I've noticed text appears pixelated, but photos do not. Is there a complete list of how iOS handles this scaling?\n\nA: I haven't found a detailed list of the exact behaviors. For the most part, it seems that everything is simply pixel-scaled (which is why text looks bad), except for images which were scaled down to begin with. I presume that the UIImageView class has some behavior to handle this automatically.\nOn Retina devices, Apple's built-in text and image rendering are aware of the scaling factor of the screen, and will render text and photos in high quality. But this doesn't seem to apply to iPhone apps run on an iPad. (See Apple's developer documentation on high-resolution screens for more information on that.)\n\nA: App interfaces are scaled up from from an image usually a PNG of a set resolution when photos are usually scaled down to fit the current interfaces. So that's why photos usually look better. \n\nA: If you run an application with iPhone user interface on iPad, it simple doubles all pixels when you zoom it, it does not reload and resize the PNG from the resources of the application as Lyken suggest. Images usually do not have strong contours that's why the \"pixelation\" is less noticeable. If you have some black text on white background as an image, you will see it same pixeled as text. iPad does not use either the retina variant of the application UI and this I find ridiculous: if the application supports retina, the OS has every information in the application bundle to give much better looking UIs but it does not care about it.\n", "Q: How can I prevent Safari from removing first words of tabs' titles? Safari has a feature which removes duplicate first words of page titles from tabs, which is useful when sites' pages all begin with the same word or two. \"Site Title | Page title 1\" and \"Site Title | Page title 2\" show up as \"Page title 1\" and \"Page title 2,\" for instance.\nHowever, this can be annoying when two pages have the same first word, but are different, such as the two Ask Different pages, \"Ask Different chat - chat.stackexchange.com\" and \"Ask a Question - Apple - Stack Exchange.\" These become \"Different chat […]\" and \"a Question […],\" which isn't very smart of Safari.\nIs there any way I can control this to whatever extent possible?\n\nA: According to this macworld article I don't believe that there is a fix yet (if you really want this fixed, you could try searching for terminal commands to fix or disable this feature). Otherwise you could try switching browsers...\n\nWhen you use tabs, Safari sets the tab's title to include the domain name as well as the page title. For instance, macosxhints.com - Submit a Hint. However, when you have more than one or two tabs opened on the same site, Safari drops the domain name from all the tabs, and just includes the page title: Submit a Hint \n\n", "Q: What happens if you create another folder alongside the Contents folder in an application bundle? I know the icons representing programs that end in .app are really a specially treated folder, and not a single file. And inside that folder, there is a folder called Contents, and in that folder lies all the guts of an application.\nIf one wanted to store information about an application (say, notes to oneself about crashes, workflows, or projects involving that application), just how bad of an idea would it be to create another folder inside the application bundle alongside the Contents folder? Would it break code signing? Make the folder stop behaving like an application bundle? Have no adverse side effects at all? Will folders inside the app bundle but outside Contents get clobbered in an app upgrade?\nFor instance, I bought Byword from the app store.\nI have /Applications/Byword.app on my computer. /Applications/Byword.app/Contents/* contains the application itself. Could I create /Applications/Byword.app/My notes/* and store my own comments about the application there?\n\nA: It wouldn't be that bad except for the whole completely using app packaging completely incorrectly. Anything inside that app won't get indexed by spotlight, if you delete that app then all notes and references are also gone. \nI can't think of a sensible use case where this would be a good idea. Unless of course you are an app developer and you are wanting to store things during app execution. \nI would not recommend doing this even though it should technically work. \n", "Q: Saving files on lost focus in console Vim I have been trying to setup the console version of vim to save any changed files when the Terminal window loses focus.\nFollowing these instructions does not work.\nAm I to assume that maybe the reason why this does not work for a console version of vim is because it's only intended to work with GUI versions, i.e. MacVim?\nIs there a way to get this to work for a console version of vim?\nI'm using the latest version of vim available in homebrew.\n\nA: :help FocusLost says:\n\n…\n  Only for the GUI version and a few console versions where this can be detected.\n  …\n\nPoking around in the code revealed the function ui_focus_change whose comment says:\n\nUsed for the GUI or for systems where this can be done in the console (Win32).\n\nBased on searching for callers, that statement seems accurate (it is only automatically called (asynchronously) from the GUI code for various platforms and (synchronously) from the non-GUI Windows code).\n\nAn answer to a related question (“Can I make Tmux tell Vim when its pane loses focus?”) over on Unix & Linux pointed out a new Vim plugin called Vitality. The plugin makes a series of Vim configurations to enable FocusLost and FocusGained autocommands for instances running under iTerm 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*It configures Vim to send a special control sequences that cause iTerm 2 to send “focus out” and “focus in” control sequences when the iTerm 2 window loses/gains focus (though apparently iTerm 2 currently fumbles these sequences a bit when switching tabs inside a window).\n\n*It configures Vim to recognize the “focus out” and “focus in” sequences as rarely used keys (F24 and F25).\nThis is done instead of just mapping the sequences so it is possible to enable ttimeout and use a short ttimeoutlen to avoid causing delays when pressing Escape by itself.\n\n*It maps those keys to trigger FocusLost and FocusGained (via doautocmd).\n\n\nVitality is only designed to look for iTerm 2, but other terminal emulators also support the same “focus notification” control sequences: \n\n\n*\n\n*xterm from 10.6 supports them (probably xterm from most other platforms, too)\n\n*Terminal from 10.6 does not support the sequences\n\n*I do not know about 10.7’s Terminal\nIf you have some other terminal emulator that supports the same focus control sequences as iTerm 2/﻿xterm (for the details, see doc/vitality.txt, or search for “Focus” xterm’s ctlseqs), then it should fairly easy to extend Vitality to detect your terminal emulator (or you could just fake being iTerm 2 by setting the ITERM_PROFILE environment variable (export ITERM_PROFILE=not-really-iTerm)—the environment variable is the only thing that Vitality uses to check for iTerm 2)\n", "Q: Preventing Remote Desktop from reconnecting to lost connections after waking Throughout a given work day, I alternate between my Windows 7 desktop and MacBook Air, using my PC via Microsoft Remote Desktop on my Mac. When I swap from my Mac to my PC, I simply close my Mac's lid and log back in at my PC, ending the Remote Desktop session.\nThe problem is, when I log back into my Mac, Remote Desktop reconnects automatically, logging out at the PC.\nNormally this would merely an inconvenience but lately I've noticed a few key programs crashing as the result of switching between single and dual displays (I have to first minimize them on my PC prior to switching to my Mac). Plus, I've had the desktop service irrecoverably crash and been forced to hard reboot.\nPrior to buying my Mac, I used a Windows laptop. Whenever the laptop was put to sleep and the RDC connection lost, upon waking Remote Desktop would simply display the connection dialog.\nIs there a way to prevent Microsoft Remote Desktop on my Mac from automatically reinitializing lost RDC connections?\n\nA: Yes\nYou can edit the connection and under the login settings you can untick the Reconnect automatically if disconnected box. You can configure this in the Default.rdp file or alternatively in each connection if you save separate rdp files. However, as far as I am aware it will only worked if you have saved settings for that particular machine/server.\n\n", "Q: Is there a limit to the number of newsstand apps I can have installed? Newsstand seems to be a fancy folder, contianing specific apps. Normal folders on iOS have a limited number of apps which they can contain. \nDoes newsstand inherit this limit, or does the scrolling shelf bypass this limitation? Is there a hard limit to the number of apps that one can have installed in Newsstand?\n\nA: It's a shelf for a lot of subscriptions. Many more than the standard folder limits. As conceptually you could see it as a folder, but in fact its a newsstand. I tried to find some documentation on the limit for newsstand and couldn't find anything but I've seen some of my clients have a LOT of subscriptions on their shelves. \n\nA: I don't think there is. I just tried filling up my newsstand. As it appears, you only get to see a small bar when opening the application. In the small bar you can scroll through your subscriptions like on a real bookshelf. Very intuitive and smooth.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to see a list of all the apps available on the app store? I know that there are several ways to browse the App Store. You can see the featured apps, which I assume are featured by Apple staff. There's genius, which is based on your prir purchases. Then there are the Top Charts, which I guess are based on consumer choices. Categories allows you to see apps by category. \nAll of these are insanely great, but is there a way to just see an alphabetized list of all 500,000+ apps? Perhaps on iTunes on Mac OS X?\n(Incidentally, it would take a hundred thousand iPhones to see all the apps at once.)\n\nA: As far as I am aware Apple itself limits this to category. I think they have specifically not included this option to make browsing the AppStore a simpler process for not technical people, which is the bulk of their target market. Therefore even iTunes doesn't have an option to do this yet.\nI use an App called AppShopper which allows you to search for specials, and also specify which categories you want to see. I haven't used it in a while but if I recall it does have an option to list all applications in all categories.\n\nA: I'm not at my computer, so I can't test it in iTunes at the moment, but here's how to do it on iOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Featured section of the App Store.\n\n*Select the Release Date tab at the top.\n\n*Change sort method to Name.\n\n", "Q: Can I use an Apple remote to control a keynote presentation? Is it possible to use the Apple remote to control Keynote presentations? How so? I have a mid-2010 white plastic unibody MacBook. (I've been told that this isn't supported, but perhaps there are third party solutions.)\n\nA: Yes - although most people are using the iOS based Keynote Remote these days, the old infrared (which is very thin / physically touchable and very reliable in dark rooms and easily hidden in a hand) works just fine.\nThe Keynote '09 help shows what functions the various buttons will perform when you are in the various modes: Keynote window itself, presentation mode and slide switcher mode.\n\n", "Q: Manually cleaning up a threat detected by Sophos Anti-virus? I was viewing another answer on this website and one of the links lead me to a malicious website. I have Sophos Antivirus installed, and a warning immediately popped up telling me that a threat was detected:\n\nThreat: Mal/Badsrc-M\nPath and Filename: /Users/USER/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome/Default/Cache/f_000e36\nAction Available: The threat cannot be cleaned up. Please click the threat name above for manual cleanup instructions.\n\nOn the website, there are no instructions as to how to cleanup the threat. Even though this seems to be only a Windows virus, I still want it removed on my Mac so that it can't infect any other computers. Is it as simple as manually deleting the file listed above, or is there anything else I need to be worried about?\n\nA: Minus the fact that Sophos is just a giant waste of resources and space on your mac. The easiest way to clean it up would be to close chrome and go to that path in terminal and delete the file. \nOpen terminal and type the following: \nrm -f /Users/USER/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome/Default/Cache/f_000e36 \n\nThat should delete the file forcibly. \nPersonal Note: \nHaving to run antivirus on your mac to protect windows machines is like wearing a helmet at your desk cause the guy on the bike outside might get hit by a car....\n\nA: It seems that the steps Sophos wants you to take are found on this page:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Quarantine Manager.\n  \n*[...]\n  \n*If there are any threats for which the action available is 'Clean up manually', create a custom scan.\n  \n*Select the areas where the remaining threats reside and add these to the Scan Items.\n  \n*In the Options tab, select 'Delete threat' from the drop down menu.\n  \n*Click Done.\n  \n*Run the scan.\n  \n\nTip: When choosing which folder to scan in step 4, I needed to navigate to the hidden Library folder in the Sophos dialog, which I couldn't do. So what I ended up doing was using Finder's Go > Go To Folder... menu option to first get to the folder, and then I created a shortcut to the cache folder in my Documents folder. Then when it asked me to select a folder to scan, I simply followed that shortcut I created.\n\nA: You can clear your browsing data like here if you must. It is in Google chrome cache buddy.\nAnd then you find and remove:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications - any .app starting Sophos\n\n*/Library/Application Support/Sophos - entire folder (SAV 9 only)\n\n*/Library/Caches - all folders with com.sophos in name\n\n*/Library/Contextual Menu Items/Sophos Anti-Virus.plugin (SAV 8 only)\n\n*/Library/Extensions - all .kext files with Sophos in name\n\n*/Library/Frameworks/SAVI.framework & SUMScanKit.framework\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents - all .plists with sophos in name\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons - all com.sophos plists\n\n*/Library/Sophos Anti-Virus - entire folder\n\n*/Library/usr/bin/sweep N.B. /Library/usr folder is invisible in the Finder.\n\n", "Q: Why does Launchpad not remember my icon settings? I'm trying to use the Launchpad feature in Mac OS X, but my icons keep on getting rearranged.\nI'll manually move icons around to my liking, but then after a restart, many of them are automatically rearranged to a different order than what I specified.\nNote: It doesn't add an icon to a folder nor does it remove an icon from a folder. I've only seen it rearrange folders or icons which aren't in folders.\nWhy is this happening, and is there any way to fix it?\n\nA: There is an Apple Discussion here that describes the same problem, and refers to this OSX Dialy link on how to correctly refresh LaunchPad, and fix a corrupted LaunchPad.\nThe short version of the answer is:\n\nBasically I used terminal to kill the dock with the command \"killall Dock\"\nThen I had to delete the dock database file located in \"Home Folder/Library/Application Support/Dock\" you get to your Library folder by holding down the option key while clicking \"Go\" in Finder.\nThen kill the dock again with the terminal command \"killall Dock\". \nFinally After putting all my apps back where I wanted them they are now saving.\n\n", "Q: Is there a setting to force Adium to open a new chat in a new window?

When you go to update your Mac software via Apple Update, each line item contains the size of the file. Is this the size of the download or the actual size it will take up once the update is installed?\nFor example, say I have 1,000 MB of free space, and there's an update which says \"200 MB\" in the Size column. Generally, once I install this update, will I now have 800 MB of space left on my system?\nOr is there a chance that this is not an incremental upgrade and it will replace existing files that are already taking up space on the system?\nFor example, say I have 1,000 MB of free space again, the update is 200 MB again, and the current version I have installed is taking up 100 MB of space. However, this time let's say it's not an incremental upgrade, and it will replace the 100 MB I already have, which ends up leaving me with 900 MB of free space after the upgrade.\nWhich of these scenarios generally happen when using Software Update? (Am I missing another scenario?)\n\nA: \nWhen you go to update your Mac software via Apple Update, each line item contains the size of the file. Is this the size of the download or the actual size it will take up once the update is installed?\n\nIt's the size of the download not the update itself. However, in the case of a new OS update, generally the file size and the actual install size is similar, since the OS updates normally replaces all files with new one's, and often can change a whole big set of files in one go.\n\nFor example, say I have 1,000 MB of free space, and there's an update which says \"200 MB\" in the Size column. Generally, once I install this update, will I now have 800 MB of space left on my system?\n\nIt depends on the update. Most updates replaces the existing files completely, so the increase should only be by the amount of the stored download, and any additional space needed by new files, or increase of the file sizes of any existing files. \nPlease ask if the above doesn't make sense\n\nOr is there a chance that this is not an incremental upgrade and it will replace existing files that are already taking up space on the system?\n\nFor few official updates are incremental. For the OS updates, the manual downloads offer two versions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Version 1 contains only the latest update, and is generally smaller. This will be downloaded if your only one version behind during the version check.\n\n*Version 2 contains all the updates from release 0. This is normally bigger, and will be downloaded when you are more then one version behind, irrelevant of the version your actually on.\n\n\nThe above applies to the OS updates\nAppStore updates at the moment is always a complete full version of the new application being downloaded, the copy you have replaced, and the balance trashed.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use an apple TV2 with standar tv (composite) The title say it all... Is it possible to use an apple TV2 with standar tv (composite). The apple tv 1, the original have a composite connector, but the tv2 dont. You will ask me to get an HD tv, but i dont watch TV, i like to use it for music only.\n\nA: Unfortunately, according to Apple, the only connector the new Apple TV has is HDMI, which means, if you want to use it with your TV that doesn't have HDMI input, you'll need an adapter. Just google 'HDMI to composite adapter'\nIf you only want the audio, then .... you'll still probably need an adapter. HDMI cables carry both audio and video so you'll need to convert the signal to something your TV will accept to get any music playing.\n\nA: Yes. The Apple TV 2 outputs digital music from a TOSlink port as well as the combined Video and Sound on HDMI. Although there are some cables that purport to do the transition to RCA / VGA for between $10 and $25 - I would go with an actual powered converter box from a reliable vendor that has a friendly return policy should you not like the results.\n\nA: I bought and AirPort Express, get the output in the input of my stereo, and publish music in the speaker.... work fine !\n", "Q: Which current Macs have an infrared receiver I have an Apple Remote that I used with a white plastic MacBook. I no longer have the MacBook, but still have the remote. What current Macs have an infrared receiver and can work with the Apple Remote? What current Macs do not have an infrared receiver and cannot work with the Apple Remote?\n\nA: Currently (March 2012) the MacBook Air and the Mac Pro are the only generally available macs that lack a built-in infrared receiver.\nThe white polycarbonate MacBook that is still available as a refurbished product and from educational sales channels also lacks an infrared receiver.\n\nA: The only current* model of Mac with an infrared sensor is the Mac Mini. Other than Mac Mini and Apple TV, no Apple products have included a sensor since 2012. Here's a list of models from each line of Mac computers which can receive input from an infrared Apple Remote:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro — non-Retina, Mid 2012 and earlier\n\n*MacBook Air — Mid 2009 and earlier\n\n*MacBook — Mid 2009 and earlier\n\n*iMac — Mid 2011 and earlier**\n\n\nFinally, except for the 4th generation Apple TV, all Apple devices with infrared sensors can only be used with infrared Apple Remotes, and not with any other IR devices.\n(Source: Mactracker)\n* Most recent version of a product still sold by Apple in May 2017\n** Only since the iMac G5 with iSight (from 2005), and with the somewhat surprising lone exception of the 20-inch, Mid 2009 model.\n", "Q: How big is this app update? Is it possible to see the size of the download from the App store when updating an iOS device?\nAs some users have a limited amount of online data they can use in contracts, It would be useful to know the size of the download. Currently the only way I can find out is if the update is larger than 20mb. This then tells me I have to update over a WiFi network.\n\nA: The size is normally the size of the full application. What I do is I open the application info screen and look at the file size. Remember, App Store updates are full versions of the file being downloaded, and the existing one replaced.\nThere is unfortunately no way to do this quickly, you have to check each application individually from the update screen by tapping on its icon.\nAs pointed out by @cksum, when finding the app on the iPhone, scroll to the bottom and it will show the size.\n \n\nA: If got exactly what you need! If you jailbreak your device, there is an app called AppStore Update Size from the BigBoss repository, it's free and it looks like this:\n\n\nA: To see how much space an app update takes in iOS 11, tap the more button and it will show you this:\n\n\nA: When downloading an app, your told how much space is taken over.

(mainly concerned about Adobe DRM) I would like to know if the Preview application (last release) is able to open PDF files that are DRM protected, for example by Adobe DRM system.\n\nA: Preview.app cannot view DRM protected PDFs, the only way to view these files is to change the Default Program for PDFs to Acrobat.\nPersonally, I would not advocate this due to the unsecure nature of Adobe Reader on OSX (and Windows) and would go through the onetime process to remove the DRM restrictions on each PDF\n\nA: Preview can display encrypted PDF files (if you know the password), if those files are encrypted according to the PDF standard.\nThere are other types of third-party DRM that can be applied to PDFs, and Preview cannot read those files. Adobe also has their own non-standard \"Digital Editions\" DRM, which Preview cannot read.\n", "Q: Does showing a flashing time separator slow down a Mac? Is there any reason to be concerned that showing flashing time separators would slow down my Mac, since the computer now has to keep flashing the separator? What about showing seconds? Why or why not?\n\n\nA: No.\nThe menubar is controlled by the process SystemUIServer. It requires little performance with \"flash the time separators\" enabled.\nThere are other processes which are more significant for the CPU performance.\n\nThis screenshot is taken with flashing time separators and show seconds enabled.\nYou can easily verify this by resetting the menubar using:\nkillall -KILL SystemUIServer\n\n\nA: I don't think it will do any harm. You Mac is using seconds anyway, only now he will actually display them. And about the flashing seperator, I would be too concerned about that either.  \nBasically, showing something on the display is a matter of turning pixels on and of. So your Mac has only work a tiny bit harder to turn those pixels on and off again. Maybe, their will be a very very very slight less battery performance, but nothing that will really slow down your Mac I guess.\n", "Q: Prevent Xcode windows from exiting fullscreen after wake from sleep? Often, when I log out of my computer, I'll enable \"Reopen windows when logging back in\". One of the first things I'll do when I log back on, is swipe over to my fullscreen Xcode project. \nThe Xcode window immediately exits fullscreen mode and animates back onto my desktop. This is super annoying to me, because the animation wastes time as I try to jump back into my workflow. \nIs there any way to prevent the window from shrinking upon becoming active, or at least speed up or disable the animation? \n\n\nA: Disabling the animation\nThis part of your question has been covered earlier. Unfortunately without success of finding a fitting answer.\n\nUnfortunately (at least as of 10.7.1) there does not appear to be a way to change any settings related to this animation.\nI filled a bug for this with Apple.

And the strange part is, the .srt files are working with Preview.\nI have Perian installed correctly.\nI don't mind using QuickTime 7 and I know VLC is far better in using .srt files, but still. This question intrigues me a lot. \nHow can I make QuickTime X work with .srt files?\n\nA: I strongly recommend Subler, with which you can not only soft bake the subtitles but easily add metadata as well. This allows playback with subtitles on iTunes and iOS devices as well, and even swiftly converts .mkv files for playback on these devices as well. \nSmall tutorial:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag a movie file on Subler, then drag the .srt-file on the newly opened window\n\n*Optionally choose a language and set as default to autoload\n\n*Optionally click the search icon on the top right to add metadata\n\n*Click the share icon right next to the search icon to merge the files\n\n\nA: Or you can put the SRT subtitles to a subtitle track in movies. Quicktime Player X supports multiple language of subtitles and chapters as well.

I've tried with speakers, headphones, etc,... but no sounds to hear. \nWhat can be the problem?\n\nA: Open the Sound Preferences Pane in System Preferences and make sure that the settings for output device, Output volume and Mute are set appropriately:\n\nYou might want to plug in a set of headphones or external speakers while this panel is open to confirm that the hardware is registering correctly.\n\nIf those settings all seem to be correct, Apple has a knowledgebase article: Troubleshooting issues with no audio from built-in speakers on Macs\nI have also seen instances when the settings in the Audio Midi Setup panel (You'll find it in the Utilities folder) are incorrect. Confirm that the settings for the Built-in Output are 44100 Hz 2 channel-24 bit.\n \nIf all of this fails, I have seen reports of this problem having being solved by reinstalling the system software.

Isn't HDMI going to be HDMI? Does the iPad 2 HDMI out adapter work with the new iPad?\n\nA: Based on comments on the new adapter on Apple's online store, the iPad 2 HDMI adapter is not fully supported with the new iPad:\n\nIs this a new HDMI AV Adapter ?\nIt is exactly a new product with the compatibility for the new iPad.\nIf you try to use the previous adapter on the new iPad it will tell you \"This accessory is not supported\"\n\nMy guess is that the new screen resolution of the new iPad has led to this incompatibility. Besides, with the old adapter the best you could get was 720p, with the new one it's boosted to 1080p.\n\nA: I also had this question and tried it out. My adapter works flawlessly like it used to with the iPad 2. The only thing I can think about would be \"better\" compatibility with the new retina resolution. \"Better\" in terms of, it will scale down better since the new resolution is higher than the one on my tv ^^.\n\nA: To answer your original question, yes. The adapter does work with the new iPad as the cable is described on the Apple Store:\n\nAbout the second part of your question, the only think I can think of Mirroring. It's obvious a retina screen can mirror more details to a screen then an regular one. But I guess the Apple Store employee is more informed then I am, so I would go with his answer.\n", "Q: Are there any third party displays that have similar resolution and image quality to the Thunderbolt Display? The cinema and thunderbolt displays are expensive. As such, I'm thinking about a third party display to attach to my MacBook. I currently have a Dell 24\" monitor, but the color is waaaay off. The IT guy at work was telling me about this other 27\" monitor that has the number of pixels and IPS, just like the 27\" iMac. (I'm still wondering about color temperature etc.)\nSo, are there any third party monitors that are similar, if not identical (casing and stand/mount aside) to the Thunderbolt display?\n\nA: The last time I checked up on this, about 6 months ago, the only monitor I could find that matches the Apple display was the Dell UltraSharp U2412M. However it's a 24\" and it wasn't that cheap. Dell does however have a bigger model in the range which is the Dell UltraSharp U2711.\n\nBoth are brilliant.\nI ended up buying a 27\" iMac and stopped looking further\n\nA: I would suggest you use the Samsung S27A950D 27-Inch ($700)\n\nor the Dell UltraSharp U2711 (if you're not using this one already)  ($899)\n\n", "Q: Prevent users from unchecking \"require password to wake computer from sleep or screen saver\" I've recently been given the task of securing a small network. One of the things we want to have happen is to have the computers lock down after a period of inactivity.\nThe easy thing for this, of course, is to require a password after the computer goes to sleep or the screen saver starts. The only problem is that I have users unchecking this, as it's a user preference (they don't need to authenticate as an admin to turn it off).\nI know I can log them out after a period of inactivity, but that closes all files and programs and is a bit more of a pain for everyone. If I could just have the password prompt all the time, we'd be satisfied.\nIs there a way to make the user preference \"require password to wake computer from sleep or screen saver\" only editable to an admin account?\nThe clients in question are using 10.5.8.\nThank you for any help you can provide. \n\nA: Although I have concerns about recommending this solution, you can change the access permissions for the Security (or Security & Privacy) preferences pane itself so that only the Administrator account, or members of the Administrator group, will be able to open that pane.\n[ᔥ Owen Linzmayer: Require Password to Wake 2005]\nI want to emphasize that I have not fully tested this solution and that you should proceed with caution and do your own testing  before implementing it across an entire production environment. It seems innocuous enough, but experience has taught me that changes in places that Apple does not intend you control can sometimes have consequences.\nYou can set permissions for the pane using the terminal, or by navigating to the /System/Library/PreferencePanes folder:\n\nSelecting the Security pane file:\n\ndo a Get Info using the menu, contextual menu or ⌘ + i and change the permissions for everyone to no access.

Is the connector the only difference between a Cinema Display and a Thunderbolt Display, or are there other features that changed between the two models as well?\n\nA: The Thunderbolt monitor includes a number of integrated peripherals as well as being a monitor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Three powered USB 2.0 ports\n\n*FireWire 800 port\n\n*Gigabit Ethernet port\n\n*Thunderbolt port\n\n\nThe actual connector for MiniDisplayPort and Thunderbolt is the same, but Thunderbolt can pass many protocols over the same cable, not just A/V signals.\n\nA: The panel, power and general design of the two screens are the same, however as Stuffe said above there are additional ports which are powered by the Thunderbolt connector.\nThere is also an integrated power lead for Macbook (Air/Pro) and I believe it's active power consumption is a little higher. \nThe Thunderbolt connector is not backwards compatible with a Mini Displayport 'port' - but of course a mMini Displayport is compatible with the thunderbolt 'port'. \nLast point - you can daisychain the Thunderbolt display with an additional thunderbolt (or cinema or any other) display using the Thunderbolt output port.\n", "Q: What impact can a dual monitor setup have in overall performance? I have a MacBook Pro late 2008 (2.4GHz Core 2 Duo with 4GB memory) and am considering getting a second 24\" monitor. I understand having a dual monitor setup may decrease performance, but how much would that be? How can I know if a 24\" second monitor would in fact have significant impact on my MBP performance without having to go to a store and test it myself?\n\nA: I have the same setup - a 24\" iiyama Prolite and a Early-2010 Macbook Pro with 2.4ghz dual core and 8gb of RAM. Originally I had 4, but I upped to 8.\nI've noticed almost no change in performance since adding the screen - even running heavy apps like Photoshop, there is very little to no lag - and for general web usage (Chrome, Spotify, Forklift and Textmate) there is absolutely no change and no lag. \nI'm starting to think in hindsight that it was unnecessary to upgrade the RAM (although this was a £30 job from Crucial) - the only time where I notice the addition is in boot times. \n\nA: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3246 talks about memory usage for various Mac products, including the late-2008 MacBook Pro you are using. Your MacBook allocates a portion of its RAM for video. You can hit the wall with that if you're rendering lots of video, but as far as I can tell, your GPU is discrete (ie. not part of your CPU, so multiple monitors won't affect your CPU performance) and the amount of memory allocated to video doesn't change upon hooking up a second monitor (so you won't decrease the quantity of RAM available to your applications). \n\nA: I have the same model and have had it HDMI ported to my 60in Panasonic for several months acting as my main media center. I've also used it playing Battlefield Bad Company 2 amongst other games and though I have experienced slight lag, it was more than likely due to only have 256MB vRam in that model. \nShort answer: No change in performance noticed by being dual monitored while watching movies/tv shows/working in MS Office.\n*(I know it's offtopic but..) I have to disagree with the above poster, I have noticed significant differences in my MB 5,1 after upgrading to 8GB ram, particularly with running VMWare/Parallels applications. Where it sits now, I am capable of running OSX 10.6+ with various apps like iTunes and Safari, Visual Studio 2010 in a windows environment, and Ubuntu 11.04 with several apps running such as Xchat and Steam all at the same time without significant lag. \n", "Q: Shouldn't Siri be able to run on the new iPad? Siri has been made to run on older iOS devices some time ago. It was reported by MacRumors that special hardware is what sets the iPhone 4S as the exclusive device for Siri. Enter the new iPad. \nThe new iPad supports voice dictation, which, to me anyway, is a clear indicator of at least some of this earSmart technology making its way into iPad 3. Additionally, the new iPad has some sort of access token to Apple's servers, given the voice dictation feature. As discussed by answers to my question here, the new iPad is connecting to Apple servers for voice processing. Additionally, Voice Dictation would imply that the new iPad has access tokens for Siri's servers.\nSo, we have the hardware, and we have the token. The new iPad should be able to run Siri, pending an update from Apple or the jailbreak community. \nIs this thought process correct? Have I missed anything?\n\nA: The short answer is no, not yet. The long answer is because the only (reliable/legal) way to get Siri on a non-iPhone 4S device is to use a package found in Cydia called Spire. This requires you to have access to a Siri proxy server or an iPhone 4S for the tokens. However, @chpwn (the developer of the package) has stated many times that it will not run on iOS 5.1, because the iPhone 4S IPSW (the actual firmware downloaded from Apple) cannot be unencrypted at this time. This IPSW is needed to harvest the Siri files for use on other devices. He could port it illegally, but he doesn't plan on it. Because the new iPad is running iOS 5.1, Siri cannot be run on it, plus a public JailBreak for the new iPad hasn't been released yet.\n\nA: Currently, you can use Siri on most of the iDevices thanks to a jailbreak. You can install Siri on iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch and iPad 1. But since you can jailbreak all iDevices running iOS 5.0, you can install Siri on most of the (resent) iDevices. \nIf you like what I'm saying here, you have to do some effort yourself (since the topic is balancing on the borders of (il)legality. But you'll find yourself a great tutorial in the link above and with the help of Google. \nSo I have my hopes up it won't take the jailbreak community a long time to jailbreak the new iPad with 5.1 and get Siri up and running on this new iDevice.\nSo yes. Siri will (probably) run on the new iPad, but you have to wait for a jailbreak.\n\nA: The way Siri works at the moment, means after jailbreakig the iPad 3, it should be able to run Siri without external keys, since it has dictation keys. \nHowever these keys are unique to each device, and apple can easily change Siri servers to only allow dictation to iPad keys, and the rest of Siri to iPhone 4S keys. \nSo 90% iPad 3 jailbreak will give it Siri. But apple can change that if they want. \n\nA: Siri should definitely run on iPad.. there is no  reason it shouldn't, but I think Apple is using Siri as a selling point for the new iPhone and doesn't want to corrode that yet. I'm sure when iPhone gets its next big feature, Siri will eventually make its way to other products.\n", "Q: Cannot rearrange Launchpad Icons I just installed Lion over Snow Leopard.  I was trying to rearrange the icons in Launchpad into folders/groups.  It worked for a while, but sometime in the middle of rearranging I could no longer take previously foldered/grouped icons out of the group I had previously put them.\nI performed the killall tutorial to reset Launchpad, only to have to start over again.  I tried restarting, etc., but I ran into the same problem again after a while of rearranging.\nI cannot find anything online regarding being locked out of rearranging in Launchpad.

Is there any way to install and use PowerPC applications on Intel based macs? I have older Adobe software that I would like to use, and cannot use on my new iMac.\n\nA: Instructions for installing Snow Leopard (and Rosetta) into Parallels 7 in Lion:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1365439\n\nA: There was an emulation layer called Rosetta to allow Intel Macs to run PowerPC applications that Apple provided from Mac OS X 10.4 to 10.6. Sadly, they removed it in 10.7 Lion and it no longer works. Given that you said your iMac is brand new, it presumably came with Lion preinstalled, and is unable to run anything older. So, unfortunately, the answer is no.\nYour options are to upgrade your Adobe software to an Intel version, trade in your new Mac for a slightly older used Mac (from early 2011 or earlier) and put Snow Leopard on it, or continue to use your old hardware for your Adobe software.\n\nA: There is a solution: Use Snow Leopard. It comes with rosetta which is an emulation layer for PPC apps.\nIf you use Lion there is also a solution: Use Snow Leopard:\nTo achieve a dual system configuration use either VirtualBox, VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop for Mac. \nInstall Snow Leopard on a virtual machine.\nInstall Rosetta and your applications.\nRun the applications on the virtual machine.\nIt is not the most efficient or the most convenient way, but until LionRosetta is released it should do.\nAn up to date setup is described here.\nEdit: LionRosetta is no more.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I have to have a Snow Leo partition. Pro Tools 9 only runs in SL and upgrading is not all that cheap, plus, it performs like a champ. Also, I use an app called DrumCore, which is amazing for solo recording musicians. It contains tons of loops played by top session drummers  and allows you to change the speed without degrading sound. You can cut up the loops, use midi data & a sound replacer if you want, etc etc. There is a newer version, but it is SOOOO expensive. Version 2 is PowerPC only. Running a VM isn't really feasible for audio production. So, I have to do all my drum tracks is Snow Leo & PT 9, then if I want, reboot into newer OS and open session in PT 10. But I also still have a dual 2GHz G5 which runs lightning fast with the versions of apps that were designed for it. \nIn short, don't emulate and keep your PPC Mac or buy one used is the best option.\n\nA: I was experiencing the same problem and was shocked that I can't use PPC on the Mac I bought.\nSo, after reading all of the sheepshaver and Snow Leopard forums, I finally came across \"winebottlercombo.bmg\". Look it up, download it and set it up. You might have to download xquartz.dmg as well, I had to.\nWhen you download and set up these two programs, they allow you to use a .exe (Windows execution file) and from there you can use what is known to the Mac as an \"unsupported\" ppc file as a .exe Windows file through \"Winebottler\". Totally bypasses the \"unsupported PPC\" on Mac OS X Lion.\nSo just copy the image of the CD that you want using a \nWindows pc, make sure that you are copying the .exe file and open/set it up with the wine file on your Mac and it will work like a charm, without having to go through all of the set up procedures.\nAfter it is set up, whatever .exe and .lnk file you want to use, always \"Open With--> wine.app\"\nNote: you may have to look for the .lnk file via search in Finder. That is the file I needed to find to use the program I set up.\nSo sorry if this is not so clear, I am also new to the Mac world and don't know all of the Mac lingo yet.\n\nA: I just used terminal to install FCP6 on my new intel macbook pro.  I was getting hit with the \"Cannot install PowerPC\" error when clicking on the installer.\nscreenshot1\nscreenshot2\n\nA: I bought Lion when it very first came out and it did support my camera which is a PowerPC based Canon.  The guys at the Apple Store recently ran updates and now it will not. So it is untrue that the original Lion did not support it. For some reason down the line Apple decided not to support it anymore on Lion. It was never an original cannot do that on an original Lion. \nWish they would offer me going back instead of Yosemite. I'd take them up on that one. \nMarjorie Cameron\n", "Q: Can iPad 3 play 2048×1536 video in its native resolution? Can the third generation iPad play 2048×1536 videos in its native resolution?\nI've converted some 4K footage to 2048×1536 mp4s using Apple Compressor. These files play correctly on my Mac, but iTunes refuses to sync them over to my iPad.\nHow can I achieve 1:1 pixel perfect Post-HD videos on my iPad 3?\n\nA: If you take a look at this page,  it looks like the guy figured out how to get to 1920x1440 and even up to 2048x1536 using mpeg4 or h264.\n\nA: The answer is no.  The following lists the available format for displaying video output on the device:\nVideo formats supported:\n\n\n*\n\n*H.264 video up to 1080p, 30 frames per second, High Profile level 4.1 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats\n\n*MPEG-4 video up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps per channel, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats\n\n*Motion JPEG (M-JPEG) up to 35 Mbps, 1280 by 720 pixels, 30 frames per second, audio in ulaw, PCM stereo audio in .avi file format\nSo the maximum resolution is 1080p (1920 x 1080), there is no way to displayer higher, and certainly not native through the default media playing apps at least.  3rd party apps may well allow for this if they include a suitable codec, but I am not aware of any that do.\n\nA: If you have an Apple developer account, you could copile your own VLC media player.\n", "Q: Must I download Xcode with the same Apple ID that I'm submitting with? I have an apple account and I have downloaded Xcode on my Mac. If I download Xcode on my friend's Mac because he doesn't have an account yet and he would be on the iOS program later, would he be able to upload his app (saying he downloaded Xcode with my account and he now has an apple account)? Should he download Xcode again (with his account)?\n\nA: Your friend will be fine. The account used to download Xcode is in no way connected to your iTunes connect account, which is what is used to upload your app later. Xcode prompts for login information where appropriate, so your friend has nothing to worry about. There's no need to download it again later. \n\nA: You don't have to download Xcode with the same ID as the one used to submit applications to Apple. They are distinct IDs. \nThe Apple developer ID is in no way linked to the app store consumer ID (Apple ID). And you cannot use the Apple Developer ID on the App Store or the Apple ID on the Developers portal. But you can create both using the same e-mail address.\nYou will use the Apple ID on the Mac App Store to download the latest release version of Xcode 4.3. It will will only be required to update said Xcode.\nNote: You can create an Apple ID without a credit card as noted in this answer.\nWhen using Xcode you might need to use your Apple developer ID (free) to download additional resources (documentation, support for anterior iOS versions/SDKs, command line tools)...\nYou can register for an Apple developer ID here for free.\n\nTo submit apps you need your Apple developer ID, which you will use to enroll to one or both Developer Programs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Developer Program ($99/year) for distribution on the Mac App Store \n\n*iOS Developer Program ($99/year) to distribute your apps on the iOS App Store. \nThese programs will also give you access to additional resources and beta versions of OS X, iOS, tools and SDKs. For beta versions of Xcode and beta frameworks you need to use you apple developer ID to download the DMG with the beta version directly from the developers portal.\n", "Q: How does File Vault 2 handle a Windows 7 virtual machine Thinking about using File Vault 2 on 2010 macbook air.  I have a windows 7 virtual machine using vm fusionware that is 13 gb large.  What/how will File Vault 2 handle this large space?\n\nA: Filevault 2 encryption happens on the fly while the system is running.\nIt does not affect a specific process or application. However, it does affect the I/O performance to the disk. Because Virtual Machines have a lot of read/write operations to the hard drive, the Machine will start slower when loading from the disk.\nI have 15GB Virtual Box image for Ubuntu 11.10. It runs very good because my CPU supports the New AES Instructions for accelerated encryption which Filevault 2 makes use of.\nIn answer to your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*As long as you still have 10-15% of total free space on your hard disk, Filevault 2 will handle any large VM.\n\n*But, I've looked up the Intel processors used in the 2010 Macbook air models.

I have some files in WriteNow and WordPerfect format. The WriteNow files go back as far as 1987 and the WordPerfect files are from 1998 - 2001. Some I can read, others I can't open at all. Those I can read lose most of the formatting. \nI'm talking basic \"RTF-like\" formatting for the most part, not super obscure proprietary word processing features à la the Home Depot that is MS Word. There are also some embedded graphics in whatever was the generic standard for Macintosh back then.\nEven if a file might be in RTF, that standard has changed significantly over the years and formatting is lost for the most part. \nI don't have the original software or a machine to run it on.\n\nA: for WordPerfect documents, you can also try to use OpenOffice, LibreOffice, NeoOffice (...), libwpd filter (see http://libwpd.sourceforge.net/features.html ) will then be used to convert the document in odt format.\nFor WriteNow files, the best solution is probably using an emulator. If you have access to a 64 bit Intel Mac with OsX 10.6 ( or 10.7), you can also find on http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmwaw/files/ a precompilated version of a WriteNow filter to odt : mwawOSX.zip ; ie I tried to write a small filter to convert WriteNow files, it works \"well enough\" on the few WriteNow files that I had found, so maybe it can work also for your files ( or maybe not :-~ ).\n\nA: NeoOffice seems to be able to open all my old files, WordPerfect and WriteNow!\n\nA: If you can find someone in your local Mac users group who has a working copy of DataViz's discontinued MacLink Plus product, you may be able to convert the files to a modern format.\nIf you have access to a Classic-capable machine (10.4 PPC), you could try the freeware version of FullWrite Pro from this site http://www.encyclomedia.ca/fwp/\n\nA: You don't necessarily need to find old hardware; much of what is described above can be done in an emulator like Basilisk II and, depending on your attitude towards pirating ancient software, you can probably find the old applications online as well (see for example http://www.macintoshgarden.org/apps/word-processing-presentation).  I salvaged work in Pagemaker 2 format (circa 1991) with an emulator recently.\n\nA: Just installed LibreOffice on Mac and it reads Writenow files without any problems.\n\nA: I can't address the specific file formats you're dealing with, but I had to do a manual conversion of some older AppleWorks documents.

Each document had a noisy header and footer, which I deleted, but the body of the work was present.\nThen I read through and removed junk (extraneous) characters and re-formatted the document using Markdown. If there had been more documents, or had they been longer, I would have brought the text file over to BBEdit, and used a series of search/replace to clean up the documents.\n", "Q: iPad app store country limitations In one iPad, Is it possible to download an app and susbcribe to its content with an apple id linked to one country and then use it while logged with an apple id linked to anohter country?\n\nA: Yes - in general, you are allowed to mix apps from more than one Apple ID on the same device as long as the other terms of the license agreement are upheld. Technically, there is only the requirement that you first log into the account A and accept the license terms, download the apps that Account A has purchased.\nThen you switch to Account B to accept the license terms, download the apps from Account B.\nWhen you have updates, you will have to enter the passwords and switch back and forth to accomplish the updates, so it adds work and time, but isn't something I have seen blocked as a general case.\nI can't speak for whether this is legal or might be a violation of the terms of service - I could see instances where if the only reason for this was to bypass restrictions in a country you could get called out or have your accounts terminated if you were not providing true information.

Tab-completion automatically adds the last letters. You can invoke tab-completion by pressing ⇥ while typing /Applications.\n\nA: To navigate using the terminal you will use 2 commands; cd and ls.\nTo change directory you use cd. Ex: cd myfolder/anotherFolder.\nYou can type pwd to display the current directory you are in.\nTo list the content of a directory use ls. You can get more info about the content of a directory using ls -al. \nYou will notice that here are 2 directories which are always present wherever you list the content of a directory: . and ...\n. is simply a reference to the current directory so typing cd ./somedir and cd somedir are equivalent.\n.. is a reference to the parent directory.

I have configured ssh keys for github. I have multiple ssh keys configured already.\nI need to add new ssh keys for bitbucket. But it does not seem to be working.\nHow do i restart sshd in OSX Lion?\n\nA: \nHow do i restart sshd in OSX Lion?\n\nYou probably know this already, but I'll say to be complete: if you kill sshd processes you'll terminate active SSH sessions to the machine. The sshd daemon provides ssh access to your machine. It handles incoming ssh connections. Not outbound connections.\nIf sshd is really what you mean then...\nBefore you restart it, try sending it a SIGHUP signal so it re-reads all of its configuration. You can do that with\nps -ef | grep sshd | awk {'print $2'} | sudo xargs kill -HUP\n\nIf you really want to kill all the sshd process on the machine:\nps -ef | grep sshd | awk {'print $2'} | sudo xargs kill -KILL\n\nBut try this stuff below first!\nAll that being said: if you're looking for keys for outbound sessions from the machine to be refreshed, killing sshd processes won't help you. What you really want to do is to add the new keys to the ssh-agent process with ssh-add -- that is usually sufficient to get new keys to be known to the agent.\nThe ssh-agent process handles all keyfile-based authentication for you.

Is there an easy way to do this without having to reinstall all my software on my VM?  \n\nA: Yes there is! The Unofficial Apple Weblog has dedicated a whole topic about moving your copies of Parallels.\nBasically it's just a matter of copying your Parallels folder to the new Mac. The only thing you need to do, besides moving the folder, is reinstalling the Parallels Tools. \n\nA: With Parallels Desktop 6 and 7 this has been made even easier.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Parallels Desktop on your new Mac\n\n*Copy the complete PVM file to a folder on the new Mac\n\n*Register and run Parallels and select File -> Open\n\n*Select the moved PVM file\n\n*At the Parallels prompt specify whether you copied or moved the file\n\n\nThe latter will generate new GUIDs for the file to ensure that it doesn't clash with any existing VM's on the new machine.\nPS: Even easier option once Parallels is installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double click on the copied PVM file. This will launch Parallels and shortcut the above process.\n\n\nA: These answers didn't help for me.  I'm migrating Parallels 12, and Windows 10. I couldn't get my existing VM for Windows 10 to transfer to the new MacBook Pro.\nParallels Desktop is easily restored to the new Mac using Time Machine.  Note that the VM and Bootcamp are (ALWAYS) ignored by Time Machine, and must be transferred separately.\nGet a USB stick, > 8GB, and format it using using http://www.disk-partition.com/diskpart/format-disk-partition-4125.html.\nInsert USB stick in old machine so Windows 10 sees it.\nIn your old Windows 10 VM, download the \"Media Creation Tool\" here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/.\nCreate the Windows 10 image on the USB stick using mediacreationtool.\nEject USB stick from old Windows 10 machine.\nInsert the USB stick into the Mac, and use Parallels Desktop: File/New to create the new VM.  Click \"Install Windows from image file\" and follow instructions.  It should auto locate the USB stick with the Windows 10 info.\n", "Q: Does Sparrow for iOS seamlessly integrate with Gmail's Send As feature? I just saw this blog post about Sparrow, and I was wondering about one of its features. On the website, it says that it has the following feature:\n\nQuick sender switch - switch sender account by tapping the top bar when composing a message.\n\nI'm wondering if this automatically integrates with Gmail's Send As feature or not. For example, say I have 10 accounts already set up in my Gmail account so that I can send mail as them, do I need to manually enter all the credentials for these 10 accounts in Sparrow? Or does it automatically detect these additional \"send as\" accounts and let me use them?\n\nA: Yes. Sparrow allows you to add \"aliases\" to each account so you can, from one account, send mail as a different user that's been registered as a send-as user in your Gmail account.\nYou click on the Preferences icon in the account view screen. Then click on the specific account. And then click on the 'Aliases' menu option to add new alises.\nFrom one of my accounts I send mail as either me or my business account (which happens to be set at my business ISP to forward in to my Gmail account):\n\nFrom the new mail composition window you click on the top bar to change who you're sending the email as and then you pick the account from the list Sparrow shows you:\n\n\nIt works the same way in Sparrow on OS X for what it's worth:\n\n", "Q: Securing Lion user account directories from admin access FileVault allowed me to create encrypted user directories, so that if I handed my computer over to the Apple store for repairs I could give them a clean admin account to do the necessary repairs without worrying as much that they may be browsing my personal files. (Unless they had truly malicious intent and backdoors, etc.) \nThis is less trivial to accomplish in Lion since it uses full disk encryption. I know I could make an encrypted sparsebundle or truecrypt container and use that, but that would make things like dropbox syncing for access from a windows machine much more difficult. If it had to be something like that, I would prefer that it auto-mount at login.\nIs there an easy to use way to achieve the same functionality I had in snow leopard?\n\nA: Administrators don't have ready access to files in other users home directories. Browsing your files would require extraordinary (though admittedly not technically complex) measures and malicious intent. \n\n\nI'm betting that most Apple store repair techs are a little too busy, and a little too fond of their jobs, to waste a lot of time unlocking and browsing through personal files. There's an old mail server admin adage about being able to read everyone's mail—and not caring. As a consultant I'm \"inside\" client computers all the time—seeing as little as I possibly can—and I have to tell you, most people's stuff is pretty boring.\nI do protect truly confidential data, financial information, CC info, personal photos, inside secure containers such as encrypted disk images, Password Wallet, etc. (In my case this is all in addition to the Filevault 2 protected startup disk.) Having protected the good stuff, I don't lose a lot of sleep about bored repair techs, or interlopers who gain access to my computer, viewing the rest. Your own practice must suit your own position of comfort on the security<>usability continuum, but with a little thought you can get there using the tools the system provides.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S using 3G to download songs from iCloud after iOS 5.1 update I have a limited 3G plan on my iPhone 4S and I also have iTunes Match service.\nIn order to keep the phone from downloading songs from iCloud, while under 3G connection, I had set 'Settings>Store>Use Cellular Data' to OFF. This seemed to work just fine until I downloaded the iOS 5.1 update.\nA couple of days ago I was surprised to find that while listening to shuffled music, I had ran out of credit because the Music App had been fetching songs from iCloud using 3G, even though the Setting was still OFF.\nI've been forced to turn off my 3G every time I want to listen to music on the go, which is really annoying.\nIs this a known bug? Is anyone else experiencing the same problem? Is there a fix?\nThanks!\n\nA: You need to turn off \"Use Cellular Data\" in the \"Music\" section in Settings. Then, when you go to play a song from iTunes Match when you're on 3G, it'll give you a message saying you need to be on Wi-Fi.\n\n\n", "Q: Does using the new FileVault use up less disk space than Legacy FileVault? I was using (Legacy) FileVault on Snow Leopard and when I upgraded to Lion, it kept me on Legacy FileVault. I notice that FileVault uses a lot of disk space which is then recovered once I log out. Sometimes this can be in the range of 5-8 GB. I'm thinking about switching to the new FileVault in Lion, but I'm wondering how the disk usage is compared to Legacy FileVault.\nDoes the new FileVault in Lion use up more or less space than Legacy FileVault? Will it continue to use up a lot of space temporarily (i.e. after a restart it will free up all that space)?\n\nA: The two technologies share nothing except the name and cannot be directly compared.  The old Filevault created a spare bundle image file for your home folder, which was encrypted.  The new one simply encrypts the whole drive in a way that is invisible to the user.\nIf anything there may be a slight overheard to managing a sparsebundle which will not be there for whole disk encryption, but I doubt that it will be significant enough to make it a part of your decision to use it or not.\n\nA: As Stuffe said, the two versions of FileVault are based on completely different technologies. The implications for disk space, however, are not trivial. The new FileVault is block level full-disk encryption, and as such exists completely outside the filesystem, and therefore it takes up zero filesystem space. It might take up a small amount of actual disk space, but the number you see when you \"Get Info\" your disk in Mac OS X will never be affected by Lion's new FileVault.\nThe old FileVault, however, was implemented within the filesystem - like Stuffe said, it was an encrypted sparsebundle for every user. This had implications such that if lots of space were allocated to the sparsebundle while it was mounted (while the user was logged in) it could only be reclaimed when it was unmounted (when the user logged out). I'd been in that situation many times myself, knowing that running of of space on my drive meant I had not only to trash some files but go through the agonizing process of logging out and waiting who knows how long to let Mac OS X reclaim some of that space. The new FileVault in Lion removes all of that.\n\nA: Yes - the overhead required by the new file vault encryption takes less space than the old FileVault implementation. Often ten or more gigabytes less space on drives in the 250 to 500 GB size and normal moderate file usage of photos, music and light video storage needs.\n\nThe new implementation uses only a fixed amount of space to handle the storing of the keys needed to decrypt the core storage. Most drives reserve 650.0 MB of space for the recovery HD that is created (or used) when you encrypt a whole disk in Lion using File Vault.\nThe older implementation stored the user folder only in a sparse disk image which resulted in slightly less initial overhead to create the key storage space and the initial directory to track the files within the sparse disk image. However, in use, files are marked for deletion and not actually deleted until a later \"reclaim\" or \"compact\" the storage and reclaim space that was used by this method of encrypting the files. It was not uncommon to have tens of gigabytes of space in normal situations where users had File Vault enabled on pre-Lion OS.\nWhen you switch to the new encryption - you no longer need any compact time or delay. The overhead is fixed and constant. This alone is a great benefit even before you take in account how the new logical volume stops breaking apps since the encryption is totally transparent to all applications.\nAs usual, John Siracusa's review has a great dissection of the changes that Lion made to FileVault. \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: the Ars Technica review - File system changes in Lion\nIn addition the new implementation can be enabled and disabled on the fly and the machine will handle encryption/decryption without needing double the space of the files to hold the intermediate files during decryption. With the old FileVault you could literally be stuck and unable to turn off decryption if the free space was smaller than the folder payload size. You couldn't decrypt in place and instead needed to copy the data out piecemeal or get a spare drive to hold the decrypted contents when you turned FileVault off.\n", "Q: Remove a device from 'Find My iPhone' app I cannot remove any devices from the list of devices in the 'Find My iPhone' app.\nI have also looked on iCloud.com and cannot seem to remove them there either. Is this possible outside of MobileMe?\n\nA: If you have physical access to the device, to into the iCloud settings and turn off \"Find My iPhone\". If you don't, You can remove devices from iCloud.com, provided iCloud can't find them. Go to the \"Find My iPhone\" section on iCloud.com. Click the device to select it, then click the circled \"X\" on the right. This removes the device from Find My iPhone.\n\nYou can also remove devices from the Find My iPhone app by swiping horizontally on the device.

You could always try the cut down Photoshop Elements.\nFor a good roundup, see this wonderful blog post from the Ask Different Community Blog for more info:\nGIMP vs Photoshop vs Pixelmator – Graphics Editor Shootout\n\nA: The only free alternatives I know of is GIMP. I don't like it. I don't use it, and I can't tell you anything about it. Ugly is as ugly does—and I don't find GIMP's interface conducive to creative work.\nIf we change free to low-cost my first choice is Pixelmator. It has a clean and (relatively) intuitive interface, supports layers and, most important to me, has a content aware fill feature. Lots more info and some great tutorials on the website.\n\n\nA: Okay, mark me down for ignoring the \"free\" part of the question, but I'm really quite fond of Aperture for the combination of editing and organizing that it does. It fills about 95% of what I used to use Photoshop for, plus I can keyword photos, maintain versions of edits, label faces and search for similar ones, and much more. It's become the centre of my photo organizing and editing activities.\nTogether with Apple Pages, I can do just about anything I want to do regarding photo editing, organization, and end use.\nIt won't do \"flaming text\" or other \"graphic arts\" sorts of things that Photoshop does, though. I don't miss that.\n\nA: I think you'll find Pixelmator a good alternative to Photoshop. You can get it on the Mac App Store for $14.99.\n\nA: You can also try Seashore which is a scaled down version of gimp.\nYou can have a look at this chart they have created which compares the features of GIMP, Acorn, Photoshop Elements, Pixelmator and Seashore.

I would like to add memory to my MBP, but I am worried that if I do this myself I will be in jeopardy of voiding my warranty.  Is there an authorized way to have memory added that will not void my warranty?\n\nA: No - a simple and properly done RAM replacement does not affect warranty coverage. You can have Apple do the work, or an authorized service provider to do the work or hire someone. Just understand what is covered if something happens before you pay for service.\nWhen someone breaks a mac when it's used in a way not intended, that can result in a denial of warranty service. Also - using aftermarket parts that then damage your mac can also land you in hot water. Luckily with RAM, as long as you don't physically break the mounting brackets, usually the worst thing that happens is your mac is unreliable or panics until you get proper RAM.\nThe user manual for each Apple product will clearly explain which parts are user replaceable and which are not. You can look up your manual online if you care, but no portable machine other than the MacBook Air has ram that is not user-replaceable.\n\nA: The best way to answer this kind of question is to check the Apple manuals and documentation that came with your computer. For example, the current generation MacBook Pro 15\" User Guide has a section \nfor \"Installing Additional Memory.\" That means that Apple considers installing RAM and other things noted in the manual as user replaceable parts. So as long as you follow all the installation and safety instructions listed in the manual you will not void the warranty for properly installing user serviceable parts.\nAdditionally there is another authorized way to perform the memory upgrade and that is to take you computer to Apple or an Apple Authorized Service provider and allow  them to do the task for you.  \n", "Q: ethtool Equivalent for OS X Lion Other than ifconfig, is there an app/script for OS X Lion that produces similar output/info to ethtool?\nSpecifically, I would like to be able to query the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*driver info\n\n*online/offline\n\n*speed\n\n*duplex\n\n\nOutput from ethtool looks like this:\najc@ajc-3] sudo ethtool eth0|grep Duplex                                                                                                                                                    ~\n    Duplex: Full\najc@ajc-3] sudo ethtool eth0|grep Speed                                                                                                                                                     ~\n    Speed: 100Mb/s\najc@ajc-3] sudo ethtool eth0|grep Link                                                                                                                                                      ~\n    Link detected: yes\najc@ajc-3] sudo ethtool -i eth0                                                                                                                                                             ~\ndriver: pcnet32\nversion: 1.32\nfirmware-version: \nbus-info: 0000:00:03.0\n\n\nA: Maybe networksetup can give you some information you're looking for:\nnetworksetup -getinfo Ethernet\nnetworksetup -getmedia Ethernet\n\n\nNETWORKSETUP(8)           BSD System Manager's Manual          NETWORKSETUP(8)\nNAME\n       networksetup -- configuration tool for network settings in System Preferences.\n\nBut it's not really lean and may give you less information than ifconfig\n\nA: I would mix both ifconfig and networksetup:\nifconfig\nalex@smiley:~|⇒  ifconfig en0 | grep status\nstatus: active\n\nnetworkstatus\nalex@smiley:~|⇒  networksetup -getinfo \"Ethernet Adaptor (en0)\" \nDHCP Configuration\nIP address: 192.168.1.11\nSubnet mask: 255.255.255.0\nRouter: 192.168.1.1\nClient ID:  \nIPv6: Automatic IPv6 \nIP address: none\nIPv6 Router: none \nEthernet Address: 1c:6f:65:98:de:81\n\nGrep out whichever lines from both tools that you want.

Just to be safe, you couldn't go wrong with scheduling a Genius Bar appointment and seeing what they think. It could be something different then what I've experienced.\n\nA: It's actually the sleep/wake button that rattles. It's pretty normal, and pretty easy to get used to. You can go to the Genius Bar if you like, but they may write it off as normal behavior and not replace your phone for you. Even if they do, there is no guarantee that the new one won't do it too.

This has almost always worked for me and is also high on the list of things to do when troubleshooting this type of issue on Apple's website.\nThe list details are\n\n\n*\n\n*Update iTunes\n\n*Restart iPhone\n\n*Recharge iPhone\n\n*Check USB connections\n\n*Restart Computer\n\n*Reinstall iTunes (Windows)\n\n*Resolve Software Conflicts\n\n\nIf all these steps fail Apple reccomends \nMake an appointment with a Genius or Contact Apple Technical Support\n", "Q: How do you download new songs when \"Show All Songs\" is off? When you enable iTues Match, you have a \"Show All Songs\" option. When it's on, the label text states:\n\nAll music that has been downloaded or that is stored in iCloud will be shown.\n\nWhen you turn it off, the text changes to;\n\nOnly music that has been downloaded to this device will be shown.\n\nThe extreme benefit of the latter change is that songs won't hang up when only part of an album has been downloaded and the player advances to an undownloaded song.\nIs there another way to download music even if \"Show All Music\" is turned off?\n\nA: I have noticed this and sadly, I haven't found a way to enable it, I don't want to see every song on my iPhone either, just the ones I have downloaded. \nIf I want to listen to something not listed I have to change the setting back and then download, then change it back after downloading.\nAlternatively you could (but at risk of wasting 1) Time and 2) Money) try these.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the device into iTunes, or sync over a network\n\n*you can enable automatically download purchases to the iPhone\n\n", "Q: Can you talk on the iPhone and use Siri with Monster beats headphones? I want a set of Beats by Dre headphones and have seen that they come with a control on the cord. Does this have a Mic? and can it be used with Siri in the same way the official Apple ones can?\nI have looked at online reviews etc, but little is mentioned with iPhone voice compatibility.\n\nA: Yes.\nThe Monster Beats cables are fully compatible with Apple hardware. They have a mic to support voice actions and Siri. They also have all the hardware buttons for playing music and making phone calls.\nI happen to own the Beats Solo headphones.  This is what the packaging says:\n\n\"Made for iPod\", \"Made for iPhone\" and \"Made for iPad\" mean that an\nelectronic accessory has been designed to connect specifically to\niPod, iPhone or iPad, respectively, and has been certified by the\ndeveloper to meet Apple performance standards.\n(also see MiF logo on Apple's website)\n\nThese minimum standards would include voice and button actions using the headset.\n\n\n\nA: Yes.\nYou should be okay. The beats headphones mic is simply an extension of the built-in mic. Additionally, the hardware to filter out background noise is inside of your iPhone and so the mic won't make much of a difference. Can you do same thing with your standard Apple headphones, right? It's the same thing.\nI personally use Klipsch ONE headphones with my iPhone 4. It works well with voice commands. I used my Apple earbuds with the new iPad before. Dictation works like a charm. So, yes, you can.  \n", "Q: How long does it take for Apple to bill me for purchases on iTunes? I've noticed that I'll often get an email about 24 hours after my purchase took place on iTunes. Does Apple have some sort of billing cycle, or does the withdrawal frm my account actually happen immediately? \n\nA: Per the iTunes Store — Terms and Conditions\n\nIf a credit card or your PayPal account is being used for a transaction, Apple may obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the order. Billing occurs at the time of or shortly after your transaction. If you are using 1-Click purchasing or your PayPal account, your order may be authorized and billed in increments during one purchasing session, so it may appear as multiple orders on your statement. If an iTunes Card, iTunes Store Gift Certificate, or Allowance Account is used for a transaction, the amount is deducted at the time of your transaction. When making purchases, content credits are used first, followed by Gift Certificate, iTunes Card, or Allowance Account credits; your credit card or PayPal account is then charged for any remaining balance.\n\n\nA: From my experience and from checking the last couple of months of receipts my average is 24-72 hours with the longest being just under 2 weeks.  \n", "Q: Is there a list of punctuation commands for iPad dictation? I'm sure Apple has published something similar for Siri, but now that the iPad dictation is out, where can I find a list of commands for dictation? Can I do things like hit the enter key, or type symbols? I'm obviously able to enter periods and question mark's, but beyond that I'm not so sure. So, how can I type out the words question mark Without actually getting a question mark?\n\nA: Siri dictation is never going to be 100% accurate and the easiest way to get the result you want may be to edit the text by hand after you've dictated the body of the message.\nJim Rhoades provides a useful list of Siri dictation commands.\n", "Q: What is the benefit of purchasing a Mac formatted External Hard Drive? I have seen in shops that you can buy external Hard drives in both Windows and Mac format.\nI was under the impression that an external Hard drive will work across both platforms, however having seen this and the fact that the Mac formatted one was £20 ($32) more expensive for the same capacity. I wanted to know what the difference is and what the benefits of a pre-formatted hard drive were.\n\nA: There is no benefit to purchasing a Macintosh formatted drive because it is trivial to reformat the drive yourself using Disk Utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility.  \n\n*Select your new disk from the panel on the left. Select the disk, not\nthe partition which appears below it.\n\n*Click on the Partition tab on the right.\n\n*Important if you plan to use this as a bootable drive, select Options… (under the Partition Layout section) and choose a GUID partition map (assuming you're using Intel based Macs.)\n\n*Select the Format which is Mac OS Extended (Journaled) unless\nyou know the specific reason why you're using something else. I would also leave the drive as a single partition unless you have a  clear idea about why you're not doing so.\n\n*Click on Apply.\n\n\nA: None to any user who knows how to format it with Disk Utility. Its just a marketing method to justify a slightly higher cost. Now if you plan to plug it into a Airport Extreme as a external hard drive and don't have a Mac in the house to format it, then it has value. \n\nA: It is interesting to note that Hard Drive Manufacturers use the correct meaning of \"Gigabytes\" when referring to hard drives, and not what most people think of as a GB which is actually a Gibibyte:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gigabyte = 10 to the 9 bytes = 1000000000bytes = 1000 megabytes\n\n*Gibibyte = 2 to the 30 bytes = 1073741824bytes = 1024 mebibytes\nSince Mac OS X also switched to this \"proper\" definition for storage units such as Gigabytes as of Snow Leopard, then the size of the drive as mentioned on the box is more likely to be accurate when formatted for a Mac Partition than for a Windows Partition where your usable space seems \"lower\".\nNote that all this is just so much technical drivel, your actual space available is the same on both, it's just that from a marketing perspective the given size will be correct on Mac as they have a common understanding of what a Gigabyte is, and incorrect on Windows which uses the commonly misused Gibibyte structure on it's filesystems whilst users incorrectly assume it is measures in Gigabytes.\nTechnically manufacturers should use GiB not GB when marketting and packaging their drives, but they don't/won't, and use Gigabyte which they know practically everyone uses incorrectly.\nSo, to make this a valid answer, the benefit is to know accurately the size of the drive you bought, and not have it magically shrink when you use it.\n\nA: It's probably no different hardware-wise, just already formatted for the Mac. There's a whole pile of people who still think Macs need special everything, so the companies take advantage of that to fleece them out of an extra £20. \nIn general, you don't need special Mac-only hardware stuff anymore. Hard drives, RAM, peripherals, etc. are all fairly generally universally compatible; even the stuff that's generally seen as \"Mac\" (i.e., FireWire and now Thunderbolt) is Windows- and Linux-compatible and will generally work fine.\nEDIT: I guess I can think of one good reason to buy a pre-formatted \"Mac\" drive: if the user is not someone who is comfortable formatting disks. On the other hand, Disk Utility is sufficiently straightforward I've walked my parents through formatting drives a couple of times over the phone, so I wouldn't waste the money.\n\nA: It's a dumb tax from the manufactures plain and simple. As mentioned above for anyone not comfortable with formatting their own drive. \nAnother thing to note FAT32 has file size limits (2GB per file) which is why if you're not comfortable with formatting a drive on OS X it might become an issue with the size of files some things create in OS X, video being the biggest culprit. \n\nA: I would add that sometimes the higher price comes from having on board firewire vs. USB connections.\nThat's about the only reason I'd consider paying more for the hardware. Like @jaberg said - re-partitioning (as well as formatting) using Disk Utility is the way to go.\n\nA: You get the privilege of paying a bit more for the same thing to keep a Mac-friendly vendor alive.\nThis might be useful in terms of tech support: if you need to call someone who advertises \"Mac formatted drives,\" you're probably more likely to get Mac-knowledgeable help.\n\nA: There are some advantages of the HFS+ journaled file system that Apple uses. It works better with the Mac OS, so if you are not sharing the drive with wintel machines, go with the Mac format.\nI am currently attempting to format a Western Digital 4 Tb drive, but because of the default Windows settings, the drive appears in Disk Utility as a 2 Gb drive. I cannot seem to find how to rectify the situation -- the WD documentation for the Mac is terrible! Maybe it is a jumper setting of some sort. This might be a reason to go with a drive that is already formatted for Mac, even apart from Firewire ports and all that.\nI am a longtime Mac user and have reformatted tens of drives in my time, so normally I would say just buy a generic drive and reformat it. But this WD experience is annoying and it is related to Microsoft's 2 Tb limit. We all end up paying for their mediocrity and lack of foresight. Dead time.........\nSo if you are a mac user, you might spare yourself some headaches. \n", "Q: Is it possible to search for text in iBooks or the Kindle app? Is it possible to search for text in iBooks or the Kindle app?  I'm deciding whether to buy electronic copies of some of my reference books, but I would only be purchasing them for the ability to search through the books for specific terms and words.\n\nA: Yes, in both the iBooks and Kindle apps, you can search the full text (excluding text in images) of the book you are currently reading.  Here's how to do that in each app:\niBooks app\nWhile reading a book, tap the screen.  A magnifying glass icon becomes visible in the top right, along with other controls.  Clicking the magnifying glass icon brings up a search box.  After entering your search term in the box, iBooks presents a list of results from the current book, underneath the search box.\n\nKindle app\nSimilarly, while reading a book, tap the screen. At the bottom a magnifying glass icon will become visible.  It works much like the iBooks search feature.\n\nWhat about searching across all books?\nIf you wanted to know whether you can enter a search term at the top-level of these apps and have them search across all books stored in the app:  No, currently neither iBooks nor the Kindle app have such a feature.\nHowever, I have seen this capability on the Kindle device itself – I own a Kindle keyboard model and there is a \"search my items\" option available that will search all books on the device for a given term.\n\nA: The search function doesn't work on my ipad with the Kindle app - I've tried it with various books. The magnifying glass appears, but will only allow a search on Google and Wikipedia! There are up and down arrows available, but they are 'dulled and dead'.  On the Kindle the search on the same books works fine.\n\nA: If you are doing it on an iPad you need wifi I had it not work for me because there was no wifi. \nWhen I tried but with wifi it worked. On a phone I also would suggest being sure there is wifi or data and bars. \nThis is for the kindle app I don't work with iBooks much.\n\nA: Easy. Convert all your Kindle books to epubs using Calibre. Store the epubs in their own folder. Search the directory  at will.\n", "Q: How can I install getent on Snow Leopard? I have several scripts which require the utility getent. In addition, I've read several handy tips which use getent.\ngetent is a Networking utility which is widely available on Unix, *BSD and Linux-based systems. This tool is commonly used by Sysadmins and power users to lookup network information (IP addresses, etc). As far as hostnames go, getent is one of the few tools which use both /etc/hosts and DNS.\nAs Wikipedia says:\n\ngetent is a unix command that helps a user get entries in a number of\n  important text files called databases.\n\nThe important thing here is that getent will search the same name services in the same order as would most applications on a unix-like system. This makes it invaluable when debugging system or application trouble.\nTools like dig and nslookup specifically look at DNS only, while dscl expects you to spell out the name services you want to search.\nI would like to use getent for two testcases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Parse /etc/hosts before querying DNS. For example, if I add testhost.example.org to /etc/hosts, then getent hosts testhost.example.org should use the entry from /etc/hosts before querying DNS.\n\n*Query LDAP using getent\nMacPorts does not seem to provide a package providing getent.\nDoes getent exist on Snow Leopard?\n\nA: Have a look at How to emulate Unix’ getent with MacOSX’s dscl.  Since you have scripts that make use of getent, you may wish to pursue a script as a wrapper around dscl.\n\nA: dscacheutil is probably the best way to do this. It doesn't emulate the usual search process, it uses it, so you'll actually get the same results as a standard lookup (including caching, /etc/hosts, computer records in directory services, DNS, mDNS for .local names, etc).\n$ dscacheutil -q host -a name www.apple.com\nname: e3191.c.akamaiedge.net\nalias: www.apple.com www.isg-apple.com.akadns.net www.apple.com.edgekey.net \nip_address: 69.192.45.15\n\n$ dscacheutil -q host -a name gordons-mbp.local\nname: gordons-mbp.local\nipv6_address: fe80:5::e6ce:8fff:fe50:136\n\nname: gordons-mbp.local\nip_address: 192.168.10.249\n\n$ dscacheutil -q host -a ip_address 127.0.0.1\nname: localhost\nalias: 1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa \nip_address: 127.0.0.1\n\n$ dscacheutil -q user -a name gordon\nname: gordon\npassword: ********\nuid: 501\ngid: 20\ndir: /Users/gordon\nshell: /bin/bash\ngecos: Gordon Davisson\n\n\nA: It's not rocket science to scrounge the getent source from OpenSolaris (or some other OS, I'd try one of the BSDs rather than Linux) and port it; I got that to work mainly by just disabling the stuff that macOS didn't have any equivalent for (netmasks and project - Solaris specific).  Or one can write it in perl fairly easily.  Someone did a limited one a long time ago, and I did a more complete one; it doesn't support ethers because there's no standard lookup for that from perl, but the rest seems to work ok.\ngetent.pl\n", "Q: Selectively control when Aperture/iPhoto opens Both Aperture and iPhoto have a setting of whether to open \"when a camera is connected.\" I want this option to be checked, but I don't want it to consider my iPad a camera. How can I enable it for some devices but not others?\n\nA: 1) Open Image Capture from the Spotlight (You can also find it in the Applications folder)\n2) Connect your iPad\n3) You should see your device listed under devices column on the left. Select it.\n4) In the bottom left, choose \"No Application\" under the option for choosing which application opens when this device is connected.\n\n", "Q: How do I prevent my Mac from opening so many windows every time I restart? I have to restart my Mac all the time because I'm using Boot Camp and switching in between Windows 8 and OS X. Every time I restart and come back to OS X, my screen gets flooded with open windows, every thing from Firefox to text editors. Is there any way to set it up  so that there are no open windows upon restart?  \n\nA: Disable Resume on login permanently\nWhat you are experiencing are the benefits of working with Resume. A feature introduced with Mac OS X Lion to restore windows upon next launch or login.\n\nUnchecking the box does not have a permanent effect. This can be achieved by manual tweaking.\nOpen the Terminal and enter:\ncurl http://goo.gl/Z4EFC -L -s -o ~/fixlogin.sh && md5 -q ~/fixlogin.sh | xargs -I % mv ~/fixlogin.sh ~/%.sh && chmod +x ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh && sudo ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh ; rm ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh\n\nThis command downloads the following script and fully installs it:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"#!/bin/bash\" > /tmp/loginfix.sh\necho \"rm /Users/*/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*\" >> /tmp/loginfix.sh\nmv /tmp/loginfix.sh /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\nchmod +x /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\n\nEt voilà, you are done!\nIf you want to revert to the default behavior of Resume in lion, type this.\nsudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook\n\nDisable Resume when launching apps\nYou can also disable Resume for applications on a per app basis. See these answers here.\n\nA: You have two choices. You can choose that your applications not resume their previous state when you shutdown or restart the Mac by deselecting the checkbox that appears prior to shutdown:\n\nOr you can navigate to the General pane in System Preferences and deselect the Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps option. However, if you do this, applications will never resume their previous state, even when quit and restarted during a single boot session.\n\n\nA: When you go to shutdown/restart, unclick the check box to disable the resume feature, which is likely what is opening all these windows (that were present upon shutdown).\n\nIf this doesn't do it, check that these applications are not in your user start up list.\n\n", "Q: Assisting Boot Camp Assistant I decided to \"give a hand\" to Boot Camp and partition my drive, setting aside a FAT32 partition for installing windows (through Boot Camp) in the future.\nCan one do this or does Boot Camp Assistant need to be handed a single-partition drive and do the partition itself?\n\nA: From the Boot Camp FAQ:\n\nBoot Camp Assistant works only with an Intel-based Mac that has a single hard disk partition\n\nBoot Camp won't work with your multiple partitions, unless the partitioning was done by Boot Camp itself.\nYou'll probably need to undo the partition to use Boot Camp, or use one of the many ways discussed online for installing Windows without the usual Boot Camp installation steps.\n", "Q: How can I programatically fill a flash drive with my latest photos from iPhoto? Suppose I want to fill up a flash drive with the most recent photos in my iPhoto Library.\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to end up with an external drive that has all my photos in a single directory (no nested folders)\n\n*Those photos that have been modified, I want the modified version of the photo to end up on the drive.\n\n*Those photos that have not been modified, I want the original version of the photo to end up on the drive\n\n*I want to start with the newest photo and work backward in time, so when the drive fills up, the latest photos will be included on the external drive.\n\n*I fully expect that the external drive cannot hold all the pictures in my library. Any warning to this effect must be non-modally, and not prevent the script from proceeding to fill the drive with the newest photos in my library, then halt gracefully when the disk is full.\n\n*I want to do this programmatically (shell or AppleScript), without launching iPhoto.\nDoes anyone know how to go about doing this? I've written some shell scripts over the years, but none of them quite work the way I'd hoped.\nI suspect the right answer will involve some copying and some \"if\" statements.\n\nA: I have written a script to do this for you. It is available here. It works with system Ruby (1.8.6 in Lion) with no external dependencies. This is how you use it (also included in the README):\n\nThis script looks for an iPhoto '11 album data file in\n~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/AlbumData.xml\n\nThis is the standard place for iPhoto to store the album data file, so\n  it's very likely you have it here if you have iPhoto.\nRecommended use for the script is to copy it to wherever you wish to\n  backup the files to, then invoke it on the command line:\n$ruby iphoto.rb\n\nThis will scan the album data file, sort the photos by date, newest\n  first, then copy them to the desired destination until the drive is\n  full. Alternatively, you can manually specify the path you wish to\n  copy to as an argument parameter, in case you want to store the script\n  somewhere else:\n$ruby iphoto.rb /Volumes/Backup\n\nThis script was written with exactly one user in mind; that is why it\n  has no other options.\n\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*I have tested this on exactly one iPhoto library: mine. It works for me, but YMMV.\n  \n*The number in front of the files is the \"DateAsTimerInterval\" value from the album data file. I don't know how to convert it to a \"real\" date, but sorting by it does sort chronologically, so it's good enough for the purposes of this script.\n  \n\n", "Q: How loud a noise can MacBook Air speakers produce? I can find official documentation about how loud the operating noise on a MacBook Air is\n\nand information about the speakers \n\nbut no official documentation about how loud the speakers can be. Is there any official report from Apple about the maximum amount of decibels the speakers on any of its computers can produce? If not, what would be the best way to answer this question?\n\nA: Output statistics such are usually reported as Watts. This sounds like what you are looking for. This is, unfortunately, a totally worthless data point, and the reasons why are beyond the scope of an answer on this forum.\nYour best bet for measuring output, such as decibels/watt/meter, is an SPL (sound pressure level) meter. This would give you the best data set of output at different volumes and distances with different types of audio. You can actually get one for iOS right here that can measure the output of your speakers. \n\nA: The info you have there is the acoustic specifications. In other words, how noisy is the air when not playing sound (fans, etc).\nIf they were to give a figure on how loud the speakers are it would be completely subjective because the speakers only respond to a limited frequency range and there is no real 'retail' standard to quote (eg. RMS vs Peak, A or C weighted, SPL type, etc).\nShort story is, they are a lot louder than I anticipated but are only useful for general PC sound (Chat, YouTube, etc), not for playing loud music, etc.\nThey are on display practically everywhere so why not try one in a store?\n", "Q: How do I manually uninstall the Developer Tools? I installed the Developer Tools way back in Tiger or Leopard and I'd like to uninstall them now. I have Xcode 4.0.2. How do I uninstall them manually?\n\nA: Yes, simply run the following in Terminal:\nsudo <Xcode>/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\nWhere <Xcode> is the default installation of Xcode, typically:\nsudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\n\nA: Based on your OP, I am assuming you are running pre-Lion Xcode. This is covered in the documentation that comes with the Developer Tools install:\n/Developer/About Xcode\n\nUninstalling Xcode Developer Tools\n  To uninstall Xcode developer tools on the boot volume along with the  directory, from a Terminal window type:\n  $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all  \nTo remove the underlying developer content on the boot volume, but leave the  directory and supporting files untouched, from a Terminal window type:\n  $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools -- mode=systemsupport\n  To just remove the UNIX development support on the boot volume, but leave the  directory and supporting files untouched, from a Terminal window type:\n  $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=unixdev  \nFinally, to just uninstall the  directory you can simply drag it to the trash, or from a Terminal window type:\n  $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=xcodedir  \nNOTE: The uninstaller that ships with previous versions of the Xcode developer tools will not clean everything off of your system properly. You should use the one installed with these Xcode developer tools.  \n\nPleae super-double check that this documentation either exists with your installation or is the same as your installation before you act. As with any such commands, precision and compatibility are critical.\n\nA: It looks like you just have to remove the /Developer folder (especially if you have already installed version 4.3 or later of Xcode). The Xcode section of the Apple Developer Support Center actually tells you to do this (emphasis mine).\n\nI've installed the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store, but a previous version of Xcode (4.2.1 or earlier) keeps launching. What should I do?\n\nTo run the latest version of Xcode, make sure you are launching Xcode.app from the Applications folder. Xcode 4.3 and later is packaged on the Mac App Store as a single application and installs in your Applications folder as Xcode.app.\nPrevious versions of Xcode placed the tools and frameworks in the Developer folder. You can delete the older version of Xcode by dragging the Developer folder to the trash.\n\nThis is reiterated in New Features in Xcode 4.3 (emphasis mine).\n\nThe simplification afforded by repackaging Xcode 4.3 as a single app bundle eliminates the need for the /Developer directory containing prior versions of Xcode. As a result, the Install Xcode application and the uninstall-devtools command line script are also no longer needed.\nNote: The first time you run Xcode 4.3, you are prompted with a dialog to delete the Install Xcode application from the Applications directory if one is resident, and to remove any older installation of Xcode (Figure 4). These actions are optional, Xcode 4.3 can co-exist with older installations of Xcode on the same Mac. Some operations may require an administrator password to enable them if you switch from one version of Xcode to another.\nFigure 4  Option to remove older versions of Xcode\n\nIf you choose not to delete these items on the first launch of Xcode 4.3, you can remove the /Developer folder and the Install Xcode application by dragging them to the Trash at any time.\n\n\nA: cd Library\nsudo rm -rf Developer/\n", "Q: How do I set the window minimize and maximize speed without using the shift-key I would like to setup my computer (Macbook running snow leopard) so that it will maximize and minimize the windows slowly.

Now for the signal - over the air broadcast are great, but you have to triangulate the signal. So, if the nearest tower is on the opposite side of the building you're in, then the signal has to pass through the building before it gets to your antennae. I would look up the nearest tower on the web, get your Hybrid as close to that direction as you can, and/or add an actual antennae to the Hybrid - the device by itself is basically just a converter/tuner. I've also been able to plug in a cable or sat coax to it and gotten even better results. I'm still tweaking that setup.\n", "Q: Can I disable the iPad's \"helpful\" password/number shadowing? I use my iPad for lectures.  During this, it is connected to a Big Screen that the students can see.  Every now and then, I forget to turn off the \"auto lock\" feature meaning that I have to wake it up and re-enter my passcode.  Or I might want to show the students some resource on the local intranet which requires me to enter my university password.\nSince the iPad keyboard works by touch and this is a somewhat imprecise method of entering data, it seems that the iPad and its apps echo the last key struck when entering a password (on the keypad for unlocking then each number \"glows\" as entered).  This, then, reveals my password or whatever to any students who happen to be watching (usually, they're asleep by the time I have to wake up the iPad and I've learnt to wake up the iPad before waking up the students).\nBefore you ask, yes this did happen today.  I'm pretty sure that I got my passcode in before the screen or the students woke up, but to play safe I've now changed my iPad password, all my other passwords, my date of birth, my social security number, and my mother's maiden name.\nI can turn off the screen, or disconnect the iPad, but that's also a hassle and it involves me remembering that in the middle of the lecture (thinking of two things at once is never a good plan for me).\nIs there any way to disable this \"helpful\" security \"feature\"?\n\nA: There is no way to stop the 'last key ghosting' that you mention, it's baked into the OS and not controlled by a setting anywhere.  A jailbroken phone may have possibilities if you are happy with hacks etc, but I don't think you are interested in that route (correct me if wrong).\nWhat you can do is tweak the passcode requirements in ways that may reduce the number of times you need to enter your passcode.  By default, when you lock your screen (or when it times out and does it itself) you need to re-enter your pin when unlocking.  There is an option in Settings > General > Passcode Lock called Require Passcode with options of Immediately, After 1/5/15 minutes.\nThis is very useful if you want to quickly unlock after it timed out on you without needing to retype your passcode, and does not require you to turn auto-lock off.\nRealise this is only a workaround for half of your problem, but may prove useful regardless.\nAs for other passwords, you could keep them in a password manager program which allows you to copy the passwords whilst keeping them obscured and paste them into password fields.  I don't have any specific recommendations, but leave it to other answers who may be able to take inspiration from experience with these apps.\n", "Q: How can I add a second sender address with different SMTP server in iOS?

I just got an iPad and I'm trying to sync all of my Email addresses across all of my devices, including my iMac and iPhone.\nI already had an Apple ID and had iCloud set up for my iPhone and iMac, but when I went to set up my Email on my iPad it prompted me to create an @me Email address. So I did. But none of my Emails are syncing up with my iMac, and I thought the whole purpose of creating an @me account was so that all of my Emails would sync up through iCloud.\nWhat I have is a couple of different Gmail accounts that I would like to sync up using iCloud. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: Practically speaking, the answer would be no - iCloud doesn't \"sync\" multiple email accounts (this is built into iOS). @me.com email address is just like gmail - it is just another email account. If you really wanted to, you could have all your gmail forward to iCloud's @me.com email account, but that wouldn't be practical.\nTo have your Gmail accounts synced into your iPad, open Settings, on your iPad, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, select Add Account, for a Gmail account select Gmail, and enter your information in there. Repeat the process for every mail account you have. (You should notice your iCloud account in the list of email accounts when you first open it)\n\nA: First, you can sync google's calendar/contacts/mail throughout all apple devices just like you can with iCloud.\nThe integration if very easy and reliable. In general, the procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the System or Application's settings\n\n*Select the Accounts section and add your preferred service.\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to simplify and centralize your email services is\n  to forward all the mail to just one address.\n\nThis address you can then setup with all your devices to sync in the settings preferences. \n\nA: iCloud doesn't sync your email accounts, only your me.com account.\nTo truly sync the others you should have IMAP or Exchange accounts. You can then sync these with your devices, you can't do it with pop mail accounts.\n", "Q: Sparrow for iPhone: Download all mails I use Sparrow for iPhone with Gmail.\nSometimes it confuses me because the unread count for some of my labels doesn't match with the one shown in the Google Mail app (it's lower, presumably because Sparrow doesn't download all mails).\nThe thing is, that I know the expected unread counts of most labels, and if they differ from the official app, I can't quickly see whether there is something new in or not.\nI think for this to work correctly, Sparrow would have to download all mails, or update the unread mail counts from the server instead of the mails it already has on the device.\nIs that possible?\n\nA: Sparrow computes the number of unread emails based on the downloaded emails in the specific folder.\nThat would be possible to show the number of emails based on the server but some servers shows the wrong information, some servers requires to consume lots of bandwidth to get that information.\n\nA: No need to waste all your bandwidth on downloading all mails.

I don't understand why Apple does not use SSD drives in the Macbook Air like some other manufacturers to (e.g. Asus, Samsung). The technical specifications of the Macbook Air on Apple's website never mention the use of SSDs.\nApple only speaks of flash memory in the Macbook Air.\n\n\n*\n\n*How does the use flash memory compare to SSDs? What are the benefits?\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does dropping the SATA interface improve the theoretical throughput and latency of I/O operations to the hard-disk?\n\n\nA: They are pretty much the same. The only thing that differentiate SSD with a flash is the fact is housed in a big case. And the MacBook Air flash memory is attached to specific card inside the MacBook Air.\nTo save space for starters (there is simply not any space left for a real SSD) and I thought is served better cooling too.\n\n\nA: \nWhat is the benefit of using flash memory in the Macbook Air?\n  How does the use flash memory compare to SSDs? What are the benefits?\n\nThe Macbook Air uses an SSD.  Apple markets it as merely flash memory because in the consumer market there are only two storage types - flash and hard drives. The typical consumer Apple is aiming for does not know what SSD is, nor do they care.  But they do know what a \"flash drive\" is, and due to aggressive marketing they believe it's better than the alternative.\nIt's a custom form-factor SSD, but it uses a SATA flash controller, and the Air reads it just as if it were any other SATA drive.  OS X does, however, understand it as an SSD and treats it slightly differently from a hard drive in order to use it to its full potential, but in every other respect it's just a custom form factor SSD.\nThe reason Apple uses a custom form factor SSD is for size, weight, and - most important to Apple - cost.\nThey have both Toshiba and Samsung on the line for supplying these SSDs.  When they get a poor price from one, they go to the other.  They need this because the SSD is one of the few things in the Air that requires custom PCB layout and comes from multiple suppliers. The pinouts and circuitry are different between the samsung and toshiba flash controllers, so they can't build them into the main PCB as Apple would prefer, without locking them into one vendor or the other.\nThe flash market is so volatile right now that they can't lock themselves into just one supplier, especially since some 80% of Apple's revenue comes from products that use copious amounts of flash.  If they thought they could get a better price manufacturing their own flash, they'd have their own plant - or ten.  Instead it's cheaper to play the major flash producers against each other to get the lowest cost.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Storage in the Air is a SATA interfaced SSD\n\n*It's not on the main PCB to give them the ability to use different parts from different suppliers\n\n*It's not a 2.5\", 1.8\", or SATA slim interface because they needed it to be smaller - they designed their own interface, but it's still SATA, just with a different low insertion force connector\n\n*They aren't using the latest and greatest chipsets due to cost and power consumption\n\n*They aren't using hard drives due to size, weight, and power consumption\n\n\nA: There seems to be a lot of confusion about the Air's Storage.\nThe Macbook Air comes with an SSD which uses an custom mini-PCIe/mSATA connector also found in some Dell and ASUS computers.\n\nSome notebooks (notably the Asus Eee PC, the MacBook Air, and the Dell mini9 and mini10) use a variant of the PCI Express Mini Card as an SSD.\n\nThe connector on the motherboard looks like this (the one on the left):\n\nThe SSD looks like this:\n\nThe Macbook Air does not drop the SATA interface. It uses a variant of the mini-PCIe/mSATA connector. You can buy upgrades which work at up to 6GBPS here for example.\n\nApple uses the term Flash Storage as it's exactly what this Solid State Drive is as opposed to the mechanical counterparts Hard Drive Disks. An SSD is (mainly) composed of a main board, a connector, a controller and flash memory chips. At least modern SSDs use flash memory as opposed to RAM based SSDs (with backup batteries for storage or without for temporary operations).\nThe great advantage of the smaller SSD with mSATA connectors comes from their form factor. They are slimmer, thiner and take less room on the motherboard. Smaller connectors require less space and less circuitry to connect with other components.\nWhen you look in the system info the drive shows up as a standard SATA SSD.\nIf you want to connect the SSD in a laptop or desktop PC there are some pretty siple adaptors like this one:\n\n\nIt seems out of scope but for a good overview of the advantages of SSDs and HDDs see here.\n\nNote: I previously thought the connector was a stock mSATA connector which is a PCI Express Mini Card-like connector which is electrically SATA. But apparently it is a variant. See this question for more info about the connector.\n\nMy wife owns one of these and they are great at retrieving large amounts of data and launching programs with large libraries (iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes...).\nBut a Macbook with a similar standard 2.5\" SSD will be just as fast.\n\nA: The genius of the unibody construction is that Apple can cut out all of the protective cases that normally are built around commodity parts to achieve much denser, lighter and slimmer products without sacrificing durability of the product.\nBy eliminating (or severely honing to a minimum) the protective cases around the battery and the mass storage drive (whether you call it a SSD or flash based storage - the chipsets in the MacBook Air and inside all SSD as well as in PCI card based storage are more the same than they are different.\nThe air is simply the first machine that required this sort of design, but I expect that soon all macs where size and weight are important can shift to a raw circuit board with a connector type storage rather than conforming to the legacy 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch packaging boundaries established long ago by drives with spinning magnetic platters.\nApple has honed the craft and practice of encasing components in a durable outer shell from the iPhone, to the iPod to the iPad as well as the MacBook Air. I would expect the MacBook Pro, mac mini and eventually the iMac to adopt these space saving designs over time. As volumes of mac sales grow - more custom design can be justified to save shipping costs, material costs, recycling burden and just make things as small as practical.\n\nA: As already mentioned, size was the reason, you can't put a case inside a MBA, no room for it. However, despite the fact that most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory, there's another thing in the SSD Drives that the MBA doesn't have \"next to it\", and that is the controller. The MBA obviously has a controller for the drive, but possibly not in the same position/size than a regular SSD. \nUPDATE\nThis is how the \"Flash Based Storage\" really looks on a MacBook Air:\n\n\nA: SSD is just marketing speak.  Solid State Drive.  It implies that it's a seperate component unit with all the stuff you usually associate with a drive - power connectors, SATA data connectors, a physical form factor which provides an indication of where is can be used (2.5\" SSD, 1.8\"  SSD etc).\nThe storage in the Air is not a \"drive\", it's just storage.  It doesn't share any of the physical aspects of an SSD other than the important one that it uses Flash Memory.\nTo simplify the answer, the storage in an Air is just raw Flash stuck straight to the motherboard.  Throw that flash into an enclosure meeting standard dimenions and with standard connectors and you have an SSD.  Why don't they use SSD?  Simply space, all that periphery is just wasted space.\n\nA: 1. Flash memory is the technology, not the product.\nEveryone has seemed to focus on the size aspect, but \"flash memory\" is really just the technology, and not really an end product. It is used in both USB storage and SSDs (the difference being the quality of the NAND memory) and it was just unfortunate that the name got tagged along and automatically associated with a particular product (USB then, SSD now) — just like how any mention of \"Wiki\" reminds one of Wikipedia, although it really only refers to the technology underneath.\nFor example, this article from Seagate, a leading manufacturer of SSDs and HDDs, does not differentiate the two terms as different products. If you also look at Apple's tech specs, they use the term flash storage, and not flash memory, which is just their way of calling it.\n2. Marketing — \"flash\" conveys notions of lightning speed\nI believe this is the primary reason — the word \"drive\" conjures up images of something in motion. From a marketing point of view, that is the exact opposite of the image you wish to convey when you tout these things as not having any movable parts. Now compare that with \"flash\", which conveys notions of transience, speed (think Flash Gordon), etc. Given Apple's meticulous care for detail, I wouldn't be surprised if they consciously decided to ditch the word \"SSD\" because of this.\n\nA: This has really been answered already, but the MBA's drive is an SSD, and it is just SATA. Apple simply removed the casing and traditional SATA connector to make a smaller interface and drive.\nIt's nothing out of the ordinary, just a custom form factor and socket to save space. Just like the RAM is DDR3, but not a SODIMM.\n\nA: SSDs consist of flash memory in a disk package.\nThe MacBook Air uses the same technology as SSD, but uses individual chips instead to meet the form factor requirements of the device.\n\nA: Most confusion comes from not knowing what the diffrence is from magnetic memory which comes from hard disc drives and what flash memory is in standard flash drives, memory cards ect... If your device is not spinning a hard disk it is using some form of flash memory. Flash DOES NOT MEAN SPEED (I.e. Flash Gordon) Flash is the way the data is saved to the memory. Example: flashing a new operating system to a android phone. The data is pushed together and flashed to the memory card. Flash generally used low current electricity for reading and writing data where as hard disk drives use magnetism. writing data to a flash memory card is actually slower than a hard disk drive f.y.i. Although reading from a flash drive is faster. The notion that flash means faster is rediculous and there are some major things left unknown about flash drives. The main thing you need to know about flash memory is that it does and will run out of memory. It won't matter what you do with it. Flash drives can only be overwritten so many times before it completely runs out of memory corrupting your data. Hard disk drives can be overwritten unlimited times. You can save and delete as much as you want without ever having to worry. It's seems extremely rediculous to me to run flash drives in all our technology in today's world, phones, tablets, notebooks, etc... They know when they put the flash drives in there that it will not last more than a few years with standard use. Some laptops last 10+ years with hard disk drives. You will not find that kind of long term use from a flash drive. It will run out of memory eventually. Flash memory is best used for read only files you never need to move, delete, change, add stuff to, etc. doing those things on flash memory cards wears them out. The worst part about it is you won't know when flash drive has run out of life. One day you turn your device on and it says \"data corrupt\" no way to save it either. \nThink of flash memory like a photo album. You save your pictures in the photo album and can look at them (read) them whenever without any harm done. Well say you want to delete a photo from your photo album. The way flash works instead of taking the photo out of the album it will just stack a blank photo on top of the one already there. So now you have 2 photos on that stack. Keep adding photos to that stack and deleting (remembering photos is any information saved in this example) and eventually the stack gets too full. Then when it is too full you will try to save a new photo on it but can only get part of the photo in there and end up ripping the photo. (This is where data corruption comes in) flash memory actually does work just like camera film in a sense. Take too many pictures on top of eachother and eventually you can't tell what the pictures are. \n", "Q: How to fix this OS X Dock Tooltip encoding problem?

I suspect that apps that use system services might take time to register each app in the appropriate places at startup. \nIs the boot time of an iOS device affected by the apps that are running at the previous shutdown or the number of apps installed?\n\nA: My experience is no one, ten or even 50 apps can slow down your boot in any measurable manner. Even an old iPhone 3 with 11 pages of apps booted in visually the same time as a freshly restored iPhone 3.\nThe reason for this is a number of design choices that provide real benefits to the running system and also are good at isolating boot times from application influences. Specifically, nothing auto-launches, there are not multiple user accounts to prepare, and the OS systems that display and interact with apps work from databases that update when apps are deleted or installed - not at boot time.\n\nA: No, during boot of an iOS device only a couple of default applications (springboard, wifi, mobile etc., which could be better called services) are started.\n\nI suspect that apps that use system services might take time to register each app in the appropriate places at startup.\n\nThis app are already registered. Let's think of using the push notification service (PNS). During startup of the app they are registering (and renew their registration) to iOS. If you manually close one of this apps or reboot the whole device, the apps is closed, not running and doesn't use any system resources (beside their permanent storage).\nIf one of this apps is notified by the PNS (or the local notification service), you get a iOS (not app specific) notification and if you then open the app, a special (pre-defined) method\n(void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification\n\nis called and the developer can decide how to handle this kind of event. If you dismiss the notification, the app is not executed.\nAs bmike wrote, the springboard load time depends of course on the number of installed apps, but I agree that this is small. Also in this this scenario the apps are actually not executed.\nTo summarize this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Number of apps installed influence the boot time only marginal (see @bmike)\n\n*App which are running at the previous shutdown does not influence the boot time.\n\n\nA: I have an iPad 1st gen with over 600 apps loaded.  It doesn't take longer than the time posted at What's the startup/reboot time for iPad (3rd generation) compared to other iOS devices? to boot up, so I don't believe the number of apps installed matters for boot up.  It does matter for checking for updates in the app store, which can take some time.\nI've rebooted it after a few weeks of using it with dozens of apps seemingly \"open\" and I've rebooted it twice in a row, and the reboot time doesn't seem to be different between the two, so the number of open or running apps does not appear to affect boot up.\nI've also recently removed the largest of the apps and a few hundred I was no longer interested in to see if I could be happy with a 16GB iPad (3rd gen).  Boot up does not seem any different in this case as well.\nThis is with iOS 5, on a first generation iPad.\n\nA: Yes,\nAs with all computing the more the device has to load up the more time it will take.\nHe difference in this case will be minimal as the total storage space of a device is fairly small and the amount of processing power taken up by the applications is also small in comparison to a computer starting up. So will not really notice a difference.\nOften iOS updates have included performance upgrades and these updates can reduce login time as the processes are shortened.\nThe case with apps running at last shutdown is dependable. When you Shut down the device totally the phone has to load up the last pages and instances the apps were in. This again is not an awful lot of processing power and will affect your start-up in seconds.\nAdvice is to keep multi-tasking apps to a minimum, as they can slow down your device overall, not just booting.\n", "Q: What is the easiest way to 'save as' in iWork?

However, sometimes we open a document and start working, only to realize that it's now (in our mind) a \"new\" document based on the original.\nApplications that support Lion's versioning will give you the option to Duplicate and Revert, meaning that they will make a copy of the current document in it's current state, then revert the original document back to its last saved state. \n\nIf some unwanted changes have been saved within the original, you can use Revert to restore the original to the state you prefer.\n\nIf a document hasn't been opened for a period of time, it will open in a locked state and you will be prompted to either unlock or duplicate it before you can make changes.\n\n\nA: The answer is No.\nVersions (autosave) is a feature introduced with Lion and the logical continuation of making OS X more like iOS - in this special also more user-friendly.  If you want to save the same document using a different name, you have to create a duplicate.\nUltimately, you need to find a solution which makes saving as a duplicate faster:\ne.g. You can assign a shortcut to Duplicate inSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts.\nThis way it takes two fast steps to save the same document as a different name:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+⌥+S to create a duplicate.\n\n*⌘+S to save duplicate using different name.\n\n\n\n\nA: Shawn Blanc suggests A Hack to Get Back \"Save As\" using Keyboard Maestro\n\nWith a keyboard shortcut of Command+Shift+S, the macro will select “Duplicate” from the File menu, choose “Duplicate and Revert” for the original document, close the original document, and then open up a Save dialog box for the new document.\n\n\nA: Without third party software, the answer is\nYes, you can.\nThe caveat is that you'll either need to repeat this for each of your iWork apps, or make it system-wide.

One of our users is complaining that he can't see the app in the Location Services settings, even though the application reports that Location Services are turned off.\nHe claims he already uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and even checked the Restriction settings. According to him, short of restoring the device (iPhone 4, iOS 5.0.1) he tried everything.\nWhat can cause an app to not show up in location services?\n\nA: It's easier for me to control for the things you know rather than guess at what one instance has shown.\n\n\n*\n\n*How many iPhone 4, iOS 5.0.1 does the app show in Location Services?\n\n*What can not prevent an app from registering for Location Services?\n\n*What can make a delete / reinstall not actually clean the user data from the device?\n\n\nCould there be a systematic issue?

I've got two Macs sitting right next to each other and I'm logged on to both of them. Is there some app that will allow me to drag and drop across the two of them? Specifically, I'm trying to share snippets of text. I could upload the text to a website or put it into a file and sync it via AirDrop or DropBox, but if there's an app that would \"combine\" the desktops while allowing me to remain logged in to both machines, that would be phenomenal. Is there such an app?\nEdit:\nTo clarify, I'd like my two desktops to behave as though they were two \"spaces\" next to each other on one computer, despite that their both logged in from separate user accounts on different machines. I'm not looking for a file-sharing solution.\n\nA: The app can do that can do what you want is Apple Remote Desktop. You can drag&Drop files from desktop to desktop and get and push clipboards from and to other computer.\nThe best set is to have 2 monitors (having the remote desktop fullscreen-ed), so that you can stare at the two computers at the same time. If you don't, you will have a window with the desktop of your second mac.\nAnother advantage of this solution is to you only have one keyboard and one mouse in front of you. And you can also put the second computer away from your desk. You just need to have it connected to you network.\n\nA: Another option is Synergy. It let you work with one set of keyboard/mouse and multiple computers (Mac, Linux and Windows). \nThe two Macs would have to be connected through network to work.\nI used this open-source software at work to share a Windows and Linux machine. Copy/Paste of text was an important part too and it worked well.\nMaybe it's a bit of an overkill if you're only looking for a kind of shared clipboard but worth a try.\n\nA: If you're using Snow Leopard or higher. You get Screen Sharing (BUILT IN For FREE). There are some limitations using the Built-In tools. For example, you can't copy and paste files by dragging it. You could use Finder and copy and paste.\nYou can't distribute files to multiple Mac's.\nIf you need more advanced features then please try Apple Remote Desktop.

This includes Firefox.\nFF is one of the applications our kids are allowed to use, but after each upgrade they are unable to use it before I approve/allow it again. I usually do the upgrades at night, and when I leave for work early in the morning this means the kids can't use FF before I get home to approve it the next evening.\nIs there any way I can approve applications without logging in to each parental controlled account, starting the application and approve it with my own username/password? \nI.e. I want to do it in one step (from my admin account) instead of in several (by logging into each restricted account). I also don't have the passwords for my kids accounts (I can get it if I want to by asking them), since I'm trying to teach them to keep their passwords safe and secret.\n\nA: There is no need to log in to individual accounts, at least with more modern versions of OS X. You can set access privileges for managed accounts from within the Users & Groups pane of System Preferences without leaving your own account.\n\n\nBy selecting the Other tab in the Parental Controls dialog you can even enable Remotely managing parental controls.\n\n\nUpon further clarification by Cra, it seems that Apple's file quarantine system is causing the difficulty. Starting with Mac OS X 10.5, files downloaded from the internet are quarantined and checked for safety. \n\nApplications that are downloaded must be approved the first time that they are run, and only the owner of the account used to initially download the software can grant that approval.\n\n\nIf you have multiple user accounts on your Mac, the user account that downloaded the file is the only user account that can remove the quarantine attribute to the file.  All other user accounts can open the quarantine file, but they will be presented with the quarantine dialog box asking \"Are you sure you want to open it?\" every time they open the file.\n\nᔥ Apple Knowledgebase:About file quarantine in Mac OS X v10.5 and v10.6 \nMake sure that you download software updates using your administrator account and that you open and approve the software from your account before making any adjustments (which may not be necessary at this point) to the Parental Control settings. It may be necessary to disable automatic updates in Firefox.\n\nThe quarantine system works by attaching an extended attribute to a downloaded file.

I'm willing to pay for them, just looking for sources of this information.\nI'm not necessarily looking for repair manuals since iFixit.com does a nice job of documenting tear down disassembly of pretty much anything Apple makes. I'm more interested in the technical discussion about bus speeds, design tradeoffs, and hints on how the machines are built and where the specific limiting factors lie.\nFor example, being able to read about the storage bus of the MacBook Air lets me know if I can replace the flash storage and not guess whether it's on a SATA bus or uses a proprietary controller in addition to a proprietary shape / connector. \n\nA: As far as repair of hardware http://ifixit.com is actually pretty awesome, more visual than you may be looking for however.\n\nA: Global Service Exchange might be what you're looking for - its the worldwide system that provides repair manuals, software, and case histories for all Apple products.

I've compared the specs and honestly just don't understand the differences. \nAnyone know whether the AT&T or Verizon iPad is more likely to work with Bell?\n\nA: It does seem to be a difficult choice, but the bottom line is that if you are typically in a 4G area, then you can get either iPad. It only matters when you are in an area without 4G coverage - then you have to choose either GSM (Rogers/AT&T) or CDMA/EVDO (Bell/Telus/Verizon). Since you're looking at Bell, go with the Verizon model. At minimum, you'll get 4G with the Bell SIM card, and if you can get the setup and configuration right, you might be able to get 3G in Canada, although that seems tricky.\nApple has typically sold the GSM model in Canada, however Bell Canada does use EVDO for 2G and 3G connections, so the Verizon iPad 3rd generation might be more suitable for your particular use.\nNote that everyone in Canada is moving to LTE, and both models support LTE as well as the various radio frequency bands needed for any given common LTE network.\nFor comparison, check out the technical specifications listed for the iPad 2 on Apple's Canadian store:\nhttp://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_iPad/family/iPad/select_iPad2\nVersus the technical specifications listed for the iPad 3rd generation shown on Apple's US store:\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_iPad/family/iPad/select_iPad\nCanada iPad 2 Wi-Fi + 3G model: UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\nAT&T iPad 3rd gen Wi-Fi + 4G for AT&T model: 4G LTE (700, 2100 MHz)1 ; UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\nVerizon iPad 3rd gen Wi-Fi + 4G for Verizon model: 4G LTE (700 MHz)1 ; CDMA EV-DO Rev. A (800, 1900 MHz); UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\nSome online reports have suggested that the LTE (4G) SIM cards from AT&T work on their Verizon iPads, which indicates that it's likely that on 4G networks it doesn't matter which iPad you buy - it only matters when you have to fall back to 3G or 2G away from population centers. Since Bell Mobility in Canada uses CDMA/EVDO for their 3G coverage then you'll likely have better coverage if you purchase the Verizon model in the US - but it's not a guarantee that you'll even be able to connect it since it's not SIM card based, as GSM is. You'll need to provide the IMEI to Bell Mobility, and hope that it's not locked to Verizon in the cellular chipset.\nI believe you'd have better luck choosing a GSM provider (Rogers) in Canada and using the AT&T model, switching the SIM card as necessary between the US and Canada.\nYou might find the following useful: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_mobile_phone_companies\nIt indicates that of the three providers Apple supports (Bell, Rogers, and Telus) only Rogers has GSM 3G coverage - which is interesting because that means that Bell and Telus customers don't get coverage outside their LTE areas.\n\nA: I bought the AT&T iPad 3 in the US and brought it to Toronto this week. I bought a Bell Mobility LTE micro-SIM from the local Bell store. I swapped out the SIM cards and the IPad connected to Bell right away. Rebooted just for good hygiene's sake. \nAt the moment, the icon indicates that I am connecting to 3G. I have not been able to find any references to indicate whether the icon is wrong or not. I got a 7.3 Mbps download from a speed test which seems fast for 3G so perhaps I am connecting at LTE speeds and the icon is wrong? \nIn contrast, I got 4.3 Mbps today back in the US with my AT&T SIM and the 4G icon live. \n", "Q: Are there any physical differences between the Verizon and AT&T iPad (3rd generation)? Should some buyers in the US be concerned which iPad they buy? \nAssuming you don't prefer AT&T over Verizon while in the US, but instead want to be sure the device will have the correct antennas, not need messing with APN settings, configuration profiles and/or jailbreak the device when the time comes to use it outside the US of A.\nAre there any internal antenna, firmware, or chipset differences to allow the Verizon iPad to work better with the legacy Verizon (non LTE) data networks? If so, is this better or worse for world usage or specific countries or locations?\nMy impression from Apple's marketing is that they are identical devices made from the same parts and manufacturing process and only get differentiated when the micro sim is inserted and it gets labeled a Verizon or AT&T iPad for sale in the US. Note: although I'm focused on US iPads, if an answer is general for iPads worldwide, awesome! However, I don't need that information for the purposes of this question.\n\nA: Yes, the two models are physically different. The radio is different.\nAs per Apple's website, the radio frequencies aren't the same. The verizon iPad supports Verizon LTE, and as per this post, AT&T 3G. However, the Verizon iPad does not support all LTE frequencies that the AT&T iPad does.\nFrom Apple.com:\n\nWi-Fi + 4G for AT&T model: 4G LTE (700, 2100 MHz); UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\nWi-Fi + 4G for Verizon model: 4G LTE (700 MHz); CDMA EV-DO Rev. A (800, 1900 MHz); UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\nNotice that there are some differences between the listed frequencies. They're nearly the same, but not quite.\nEdit:\nTo confirm, the difference is a hardware difference, not a software imposed limitation on AT&T LTE. From the Macrumors article:\n\nThe Verizon iPad hardware supports only the 700 MHz band for LTE to match the carrier's technology, while the GSM version sold for use on AT&T's network supports both the 700 MHz and 2100 MHz bands as used by that carrier.\n\nIf you're looking to travel internationally, go with the AT&T iPad. (I got the Verizon iPad because I wanted the free hotspot feature, which AT&T does not offer for free at this time.)\n\nA: There is a difference in hardware, at least that is what AT& T and Verizon say...I gifted my AT & T ipad to a friend who is on the Verizon Network, she took it to Verizon to change out the sim.  (thinking it was just the sim change out that was the difference) Verizon stated that the AT & T ipad would not work with their sim card...the only way to be able to use the ipad on Verizon 3 g was to purchase a Verizon jetpack (mobile hotspot).  I was thinking maybe this is a ploy by Verizon to sell a 2 year contract for the hotspot...so I contacted At & T, they verified that an a Verizon ipad would not work on their network and vise versa and the only workaround other than purchasing the correct version ipad for the specific carrier is to get a mobile hotspot from the carrier of your choice.  I contacted Apple support and they stated the information is true that is why when purchasing an ipad you have to chose a specific carrier.\n", "Q: Do refurbished Macs come in the standard boxes when ordered from the online store Do refurbished Macs come in the standard boxes when ordered from the online store?\n\nA: Speaking from experience, I can tell you that they do not come in the retail packaging. There are instead shipped in white box packaging. \nMy Mac was delivered by UPS, it was just the white box, with the handle, on the side of the box was the barcodes and address etc, there was a mention of Apple on the barcode stickers, but no Apple logos, or images.\nThe standard iMac box, I also know from experience, has an image of the iMac on the outside and is a thinner box (I'm guessing as it doesn't need to be shipped).

All key combos work.\nI believe the fact that the Bootcamp control panel does not show up on the Windows side, is because it is Windows 8 and Bootcamp and it's Windows support drivers are meant for Windows 7.\nAlso plugging the wireless keyboard into the mac also sped things up\n\nA: I'm not sure how likely it is that drivers tampered with the EFI.  That said, you have a few options.\nYou could try installing reFIT.  This should bring up a boot menu regardless of your holding the Option key.  You can find it here.\nYou could try resetting the System Management Controller.  I don't know so much about it to veritably say that this is causing your issue, but it's worth a shot.\nMy first course of action, however, would be to get a FireWire cable and boot to FireWire Target Disk Mode by holding \"T\" during bootup on the stunted computer and hook it up to a working Mac.  You can then try running disk integrity checks on it using Disk Utility as normal.  You can even try selecting the boot disk on that computer and restarting to see if there's an actual file-level issue with the your operating system.\nIf your disk does not appear on the Mac you attach it to, you can't boot to FireWire Target Disk Mode, or you can't boot to the OS on the attached Mac (assuming the OS is compatible), you've got additional issues which you should come back and tell us about.\n\nA: Turn off the mac, then when it is starting up again, hold the option key.

All this pus from some infection is disgusting.\" The doc will want to know what's happening, where and why. You might be right and need chemo, but it also could be something treatable with a band-aid and some bacitracin.\n", "Q: What other browsers are available for iPad As the question says, what other web browsers are available on the iPad? \nI would ideally like Chrome or Firefox.\n\nA: Dolphin Browser\n\n*\n\n*Gestures: create a personal symbol to access the websites you use the most\n\n*Visit your favorite sites with one touch.\n\n*Tabbed browsing\n\n*Bookmarks Bar\n\n*Full Screen Mode\n\n\n\nA: Chrome and Firefox are not available for the iPad. If you want an interface which looks like Chrome, you might like Diigo Browser. Here's a review of the app which may help.\n\nYou could search for \"browser\" on the app store, but realize that most of the applications that you find will still be using the same rendering engine that Apple developed. It's only the stuff around the rendering engine that will look different.\nUpdate: There is now a version of Firefox for iOS.\n\nA: Chrome and Firefox haven't been developed for iOS yet, but you could try Dolphin Browser. It's very similar to Chrome, and you can download extensions for it. Personally, Dolphin is my favorite. Opera Mini and Murcury Web Browser (quite similar to Desktop Safari) are another couple nice alternative to Mobile Safari, and Atomic Web Browser is slightly better than Safari, but doesn't have many features. If you want to watch Flash videos on your iPad, try out Skyfire. It's limited, but it does what it says. There are plenty more browsers out there for iOS, but these are the ones I use most.\nUpdate: There is now a version of Firefox for iOS.\n", "Q: What exactly is a retina display? With the advent of the new iPad, which has a retina display, I started thinking about what exactly a retina display is. I know it has higher resolution, but what exactly is the definition of a retina display?\n\nA: The definition according to Wikipedia:\n\nThe screen is marketed by Apple as the \"Retina Display\", based on the\n  assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 12\n  inches (305 mm) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel is the\n  maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.\n\n\nA: A retina display is one that equals or surpasses the human eye in resolution - in other words where the resolution of the display is higher than the visual acuity of the eye.  Specifically the fovia centralis which is the central region of the retina with the highest visual acuity, or sharpness.\nThe fovia centralis in the typical human eye can discern two lines as separate when they are more that 57 arcseconds apart, taking the eye as the center of the angle.  That's 0.16 degrees apart.  For instance, hold your hand at arms length and examine the hairs.  You'll find that hairs that are very close together will appear to be one hair, but as you bring your hand closer you'll notice there are two or more hair where previously you thought there was only one.\nApple has determined (or decided...) that people hold their phones about 10\" (25.4cm) from their eyes.  At that distance the portion of the eye with highest visual acuity (fovia centralis) cannot discern two pixels that are 3 thousandths of an inch apart as separate pixels.  The ipad is held about 15\" away from your eyes, and at that distance your eye cannot discern two pixels that are 4 thousandths of an inch apart as separate pixels.\nTherefore, at the ideal viewing distance, the resolution of these \"retina\" devices equals or exceeds the visual acuity of the portion of the human eye with the highest visual acuity - meaning that at those distances one cannot tell two adjacent pixels apart, and it appears to be one seamless image composed of continuous tones as one sees in nature, rather than a digital device composed of discrete lights.\nThis does mean that at a certain distance your monitor pixels will exceed your eye's visual acuity.  The distinction is that there's a typical or ideal viewing distance for each display device, be it a monitor, TV, theater, or billboard.  If, at that distance, the device exceeds the visual acuity of the fovia centralis, then it could be termed a retina display in the way apple is using the term.  A simple trademark search for retina and retina display suggests that Apple has not trademarked this term, and none of their advertising copy has trademark near the term, so others may be able to use this term to describe their products in other ways.\n\nA: Retina displays\nTo user Philip Schiller's own words from the WWDC2012:\n\n...which means: The pixels of this display are so small that from a\nnormal working distance your retina cannot discern those individual\npixels. (watch at youtube)\n\nThere is no industry standard for \"retina display\". The term retina display is relative, as the definition follows the human eyes's perception of a display's sharpness.\nWhen the iPhone 4 was introduced, Steve Jobs made the following definition:\n\nAt a distance of 10\" to the human eye (or retina), a pixel density of 300PPI is the maximum that an eye can distinguish.\n\nBecause this definition is relative, calling a display a retina display depends on two factors:\n\n*\n\n*pixel density\n\n*distance between the human eye an the display\n\nBoth the iPhone 4S and the new iPad have \"retina displays\" when you apply Steve Job's definition. A mathematical explanation can be found in this answer.\n \n\nA: Retina display is a marketing term invented by Apple; it means whatever they say it means. They have said in the keynote address for the iPhone 4 that it is a display in which, when viewed by an average person at an average viewing distance, individual pixels can not be discerned. \n\nWhile talking about the new display, Steve Jobs went on to detail that after a certain point the human eye fails to distinguish individual pixels. According to the Apple CEO this \"magic number,\" when visible pixelation is no more, is around 300ppi. Therefore, with the iPhone 4's screen coming in at more than 300 pixels per inch (326ppi) the display will supposedly always looks smooth and crisp, with no jaggies in sight.\n\nᔥ Chris Brandrick: iPhone 4's Retina Display Explained\nThe iPad (3rd generation) Retina display has a lower pixel density, but it is presumed that the average viewing distance is greater.\n\nA: It has to do with normal viewing distance. The new MacBook Pro has a lower dpi than the iPad, which has a lower dpi than the iPhone, but you will normally view them from respectively farther distances. At that distance it should be impossible to discern individual pixels. I wonder how many HDTVs technically count as \"retina displays\" if you consider the normal viewing distance to be from across the room.\nBut note that if you stick even the iPhone right in your face you can glimpse individual pixels. \n", "Q: What is the InterCheck process that occasionally uses 96% CPU on my Mac? I heard my computer's fan spinning fast, so I checked Activity Monitor and saw that a process called InterCheck was using close to 96% CPU. What is this process and why's it using so much CPU?\nIn the Inspect window, it said that the parent process is launchd.\n\nA: It's a real-time scanning process by Sophos Anti-Virus that scans your computer's running processes in the background.\nThe parent process is launchd so that when you accidentally kill the Intercheck process, it gets restarted.\n", "Q: Run script when logged out? Is it possible to run a script when and only when a user is logged out? Why I want to do this is so I can change the login message (sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText \"Message\"). Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: Machints has got a sample script available here to write the logon and logoff events to a log file.\nYou basically need to write your script, give it execute rights and then add it to the LogoutHook event:\n\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow \\ LogoutHook /usr/local/bin/logoutscript\n\nFor some more advanced script you can also have a look here\nAlternative solution\nHave a look at the launchd services. It's the built in service management system used by OSX. Some suggestions are to have launchd monitor a file, and using the logoutHook above, touch the file, which will trigger launchd to run. In the launchd job you can sleep the process for a few seconds to ensure that logout is completed.\nNot the ideal solution, but could work.\n\nA: You can change your login screen text, no need to run a script if this is a one-time or infrequent change. You have to add the key\n\nto /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist either with a text editor or by a terminal command which does the same thing.

I realize that opening up the iPhone can void the warranty, it's already out of warranty, so I'm okay with that. I was wondering where I could get a screwdriver that will open up the 2nd generation iPhone 4.\nThe original iPhone 4 had normal phillips screws. The newer iPhone 4 (2nd generation, not iPhone 4S) has screws that look like a 5-pointed star.\n\nA: They are called Pentalobe screws and look similar to this picture from Wikipedia:\n\nYou can find compatible screwdrivers on iFixit or Amazon. If you do go with Amazon, though, make sure you read the reviews before you buy anything, since many of them are filled with complaints about the product not working.\nThere's even a guide which will show you how to replace the screws with normal phillips ones.\n\nA: iFixit has an article calling these screws \"Pentalobe\". They also sell an \"iPhone 4 Liberation Kit\" which includes a driver and replacement screws that are Phillips-head.\nThey also mention that similar screws appear on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.\n\n\nA: The name is a Pentalobe screw. \nalthough some places call it a torx screw, this isn't quite correct (Torx screw has 6 sharper points, wheras the pentalobe has 5 more rounded points, so make sure you buy a screwdriver with the correct number at least)\nHere's a screwdrive on Amazon, although iFixit sell a \"Liberation Kit\"\n", "Q: iPhone alarm through headphones only? By default the iPhone alarm sounds both through the headphones and speakers (understandably), is there a setting somewhere to set the alarm to only go through the headphones?\n(The use case is I want to wake up with the alarm but not wake everyone else in the house)\n\nA: I found a solution, albeit it might not be ideal for some.\nInstead of using the alarm app, use the reminders app, as the reminder app plays only through your headphones while also letting you set a time for the alarm. \nThe only 2 downsides that I can see could cause issues are that it plays the set sound bite once, instead of looping it like the alarm app (solution is probably put multiple reminders back to back), as well as that the reminder app splits time into 5 min intervals, preventing you from say, setting an alarm at 6:48 for example.\n\nA: I recorded a silent alarm and then used that as the sound and set the alarm to vibrate.  This way, the vibration wakes me up but not everyone else.  The vibration works really well if you put the phone next to or under your pillow.  The phone can get warm if it is under the pillow though so I usually put it just to the side.\n\nA: You could mute the voice before inserting the earphones and then put in the earphones and set the volume. This way the alarm sound will only come through the earphones because you have muted your phone, not the earphones. \n\nA: No, unfortunately there is no such setting. Your best bet is probably to use a 3rd party app with alarm clock functionality. That way it will only play the sound through the headphones and not the speakers. The main disadvantage is that you would need to remember to keep the app launched before you go to bed each time.\n\nA: Use the built in clock app for your alarm and it will bypass the cable and come out the speaker.  All third party alarm apps fail at this...\n", "Q: AVI on the iPad? I have about 20 GB of video files that I would like to put on my new iPad.\nTo my utter surprise, there's no de facto solution for \n\n\n*\n\n*playing AVI files on iPad and\n\n*syncing any filetype on Wi-Fi without syncing to the cloud (Dropbox only allows 2 GB, and Acrosync doesn't sync AVI files).\n\n\nYeah, technically I can convert them to h.264, but that's kind of troublesome. If an app automatically does this for me then I wouldn't mind.\nHow can I do this? Surely, I can't be the only one who wants to watch their AVI videos on his iPad. \nEDIT:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any free solutions?\n\n*I want sync over wifi. Stream is a nice feature, by syncing over wifi is a must\n\n\nA: There are dozens of apps which let you watch AVI files on your iPad, some better than others. The one I currently use is AcePlayer (currently $2.99, though the price has dropped to Free a number of times), and it also supports streaming most every video type there is (mkv, divx, flv, etc.).\nOther apps with this functionality include yxplayer2 ($4.99), playable PRO (sale price $2.99, free version available), and GoodPlayer ($2.99).\n\nA: Playable covers what your looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's free (ad supported, you can pay for pro version to remove the ads),\n\n*You can upload videos to your device using your interent browser (no need for itunes)\n\n*it plays AVI files, and FLV, XVID, MP4, MOV and MKV (not HD MKV however)\n\n\nA: I know you said it was troublesome, but if you take the time to queue up these videos in Handbrake, with a target of \"Universal\", you will find it much easier to deal with them from that point onwards on both your Macs and iOS devices. Doing the queuing doesn't take long (find file, specify destination, click \"add to queue\") and you can just let them compete overnight, then drag and drop into iTunes. From then on it can't get much easier.\nI would venture to suggest it's easier to queue these up in Handbrake than to download and begin using some third party app and to maintain separate viewing queues for ever after.\n", "Q: Is there a command line mail program for Mac?

My iPhone 4s with iOS 5.1 started to present overheating very often: 2-4 times a day and this happened while the outside temperature is only around 18-20C and the phone was not under heavy use, in fact in half of the cases it wasn't even used.\nHow can I debug these?\nGoing with the phone to Apple store would be the next step, but I don't want to loose precious time. I could bet that this will not happen while a \"genius\" is playing with the phone. Also, I'm sure they will ask me to wipe the device, something I don't want to do (did it too many times and takes a lot of time to sync ~50gb of data). \nNote: Rebooting does not solve the problem!\n\nA: I would advise phoning Apple first. you will be able to speak with someone regarding the overheating error you are having. \nThey will more than likely tell you why, and failing that recommend that you go to an Apple store. They will look at the device and run diagnostics.\nIf you report an issue with a product at the store and the issue cannot be replicated they will usually replace the device with a refurb model on the spot. I have had this happen twice (the swap, not the overheating) once with an iPad and the other an iPhone 3GS, both were replaced.\nYes the sad thing is that they will need to wipe all the data if they cannot fix it after diagnostics. You will hopefully have a backup on your computer, or if you used iCloud a back-up in the cloud, which you can start to download instantly at the store.\nHope it works out for you\n\nA: Chris Breen describes his process for Troubleshooting a battery-sucking iPhone 4S.\nBy using System Activity Monitor, a low-cost app, he discovered a problem with iCloud contact syncing that was causing dataaccessd (a process) to continuously crash. His fix was to wipe the phone and do a fresh (not restored) installation, then reinstall his data and apps. \n\nI used the same process to solve my own iPhone 4 overheating issue when iOS 5 was first released. Fortunately, iCloud makes it relatively painless process to migrate data to a new phone.\n\nA: There are only three reasons your phone might be overheating when it's not due to the environment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware problem\n\n*iOS problem\n\n*Program running requires a lot of resources\n\n\n1 and 2 really require a device wipe in order to test for, since you're trying to avoid that, the only thing you can debug is 3.  The easiest way to debug that is to reset your device (power off completely, then reboot) every morning after charging, then go about your day and make note of what apps you use, and whether your phone overheats or not.  Rebooting it will make sure few to no apps are running.\nIf the overheating problem goes away then it's most likely a particular app that's causing the problem, though finding it is going to be difficult since it's one you don't use daily.\nIf the problem still happens occasionally, keep track of what apps you had run prior to it overheating, and see if there's a correlation, then try going a few days without using the app that shows up most often, and then try a few days using it every morning.  That should give you solid evidence about whether the app is the culprit or not.\nIf there's no correlation between any particular app usage and overheating, then you're pretty much going to have to wipe it.  Perform a backup, and take it to the store.  Since you have to do a wipe anyway, you might as well do it once and get a replacement while you're at it.  Apple takes overheating concerns very seriously and they should replace it without difficulty if it's under warranty.\nIf it's not under warranty, then it's worth wiping it yourself, updating the OS, loading just those apps you really need, and seeing if it still overheats.  If the problem goes away, then restore the backup and see if it returns.  If it doesn't return after the backup, then it was likely a corrupt iOS issue.  If it does return after the backup, there's some app that's causing the problem.  If the problem didn't go away after wiping and reinstalling the OS, then it's a hardware problem, and you should have it repaired or replaced.\n\nA: I do not think this overheating issue is specific to any cell phone model. I have it with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and have come to conclude that it is a MS Exchange Active Sync issue. This is my second phone already in one month. I turned off all applications, Wi-Fi and GPS when not needed, and use only button push-activated sync. Nevertheless, I have an exchange account that keeps syncing every five seconds... until phone is hot and battery low. Activity log also shows that MS Exchange uses >80% data. I stopped using this application and will report later if this \"fixes\" the problem....\n\nA: As I bicycle rider in south Florida overheating has become a huge probelm on the i-phone.  The phone gets extremely hot when set in the holder on my handlebars.  Like in several other discussions I brought the phone in to be checked. The phone is fine according to Apple.  After viewing a number of discussions I see it's more of a common problem than I thought.  After alot of frustration and lose of data I've figured out the remedy!! It's not technical but it works. I simply place a wash cloth over the device and jury rigged it with a small clamp.  Since doing this it has not overheated once.  Yesterday I was on a 4 hour ride in the sun and beside the battery problem(!) which I will describe next it never overheated.\nMy I-phone battery when using gps related program gets about 2 to 2 1/2 at tops.  For this I have turned the screen setting brightness to half.  Still another frustration.  I've just purchased a extended battery back that plugs write in to the bottom for $5 on EBay.  Also I purchased a portable charger from Brookstone.  The latter is great except I need to dismount my bicycle and invest an hour into letting it recharge.  If I take a lunch break it is super but for continueous exercise a problem.  Hence, I bought the prior mentioned plug in on ebay today.  Funny, other phones have both exteneded battery life and also no overheat problems.  hmmmmm\nRichE  \n\nA: I noticed my 4S running iOS 6 started overheating and losing power the last few days.\nI suspect it is a hardware issue resulting from the camera since when I use the camera, it starts to heat up. When I turn it off and shut down the phone it is better but still losing power; in 3 hours it went from 100% to 10% battery life.\n", "Q: How can I check for available entropy? On linux systems, one can check for available entropy (useful to know if you're tapping /dev/random for any PRNG purposes) with \ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail\n\nHowever, there is no equivalent of /proc on a Mac (AFAIK). How can I check for available system entropy on a Mac? I'm running OS X 10.7.3 (Lion)\n\nTo update with some of my comments under Kyle's answer — One of the reasons for Macs not displaying this information is that it isn't needed (in most cases). Linux systems will block calls to /dev/random if there isn't enough entropy in the pool. On Macs, it periodically keeps adding to the entropy pool using the SecurityServer daemon.\nHowever, it also notes that if the daemon fails for some reason, the output quality will decline without any indication of failure:\n\nThe quality of\n       its output is however dependent on regular addition of appropriate entropy. If the SecurityServer system daemon fails for any reason, output quality will suffer over time without any explicit indication\n       from the random device itself.\n\nSo even though the amount of entropy is not made available easily, it doesn't mean it isn't there and there might be instances where its knowledge might be helpful.\n\nA: This is not a solution, but a clarification of how entropy is gathered and used in Linux.\nLinux actually has two different entropy pools:\n/dev/random and /dev/urandom.\nThe former is a true random pool, fed by system entropy sources.\nThe latter is more of a PRNG such as those found on the BSD's and OS X.\nHowever, even urandom requires a seed of 'real' random entropy in order to produce quality pseudo-random data. On recent kernels, a complete lack of entropy in /dev/random will still not block urandom, but urandom will re-use the last valid seed until more entropy becomes available. Because urandom is nonblocking, most services that require a steady stream of entropy use it rather than relying on /dev/random.\nThere are still some services however, such as various SSL suites, which can't make do with pseudo-random entropy, but require a truly unpredictable entropy source. In this case, urandom (or any other PRNG) can't be used, and /dev/random comes into play. \n\nA: Mac OS X simply uses Yarrow. Even FreeBSD went further and switched to its improved version called \"Fortuna\".\n\nYarrow's strength is limited by the size of the key. For example, Yarrow-160 has an effective key size of 160 bits. If the security requires 256 bits, Yarrow-160 is not capable of doing the job.\n\nAll-in-all this is another reminder Apple's priorities don't include security/robustness or anything like this.\n\nA: Mac OS X, like FreeBSD, does not rely on external sources of entropy. Instead, it uses a pseudorandom number generator based on the Yarrow algorithm. Because it's using an algorithm and not an entropy pool, there's no need to make sure there's \"enough\" entropy - you will always be able to read from /dev/random without blocking.\nSo, to answer your question, unless you are \"paranoid\" and need to base your entropy on external sources (keystrokes/mouse movements/etc), in which case you have to do it yourself, the amount of available entropy for /dev/random use is always infinite.\n", "Q: What are \"dmgpart\" files and what tools can create, merge, or manage them? I downloaded something that came as three large files:  One was a *.dmg (a disk image file, which I expected) and two more were *.dmgpart files, which I haven't happened to see before – I never downloaded something so large on my Mac!\nI suppose these *.dmgpart files are just the parts of a single disk image, but spanning three files so each can fit within a target size for media backup purposes. For instance, the first two parts of my download were 4.3GB each, conspicuously the capacity of a single-layer DVD-ROM.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is my supposition about *.dmgpart files correct, or did I miss something key?\n\n*How long ago were these multi-part disk image files introduced in Mac OS X?\n\n*Is there a logical limitation to the *.dmg file format itself requiring images over a certain size to be made multi-part, or is it an optional facility for spanning media only?\n\n*How can I create multi-part disk images like this? Is this supported by the standard tools (i.e. Disk Utility), or are special command-line or other tools required?\n\n*Is there an easy way to merge the parts back into a single disk image?  (One could conceive making the mistake of not copying an entire set – not a problem where only a single image file is involved.)\n\n*Is there an easy way to split an existing very large disk image into a spanned set?\nThanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, you're correct. The hdiutil man page has a section on \"segmented\" files, disk images which are split across multiple files.\nNote that simply double-clicking on the first file should automatically mount the entire disk image, taking the others into account with no extra work!\n\n*Looking at the old man pages, we can still see segmented disk image support way back in OS X 10.2 Jaguar. (Earlier man pages aren't available there, so it might have existed even earlier.) I'm not sure the extent of support for mounting them in the GUI, but I suspect it was functional back then as well.\n\n*I'm not sure about the maximum size of a dmg file, but the man page mentions the limit for sparse images:\n\nThe maximum size of a SPARSE image is 128 petabytes; the maximum for\n  SPARSEBUNDLE\n                            is just under 8 exabytes (2^63 - 512 bytes minus 1 byte).  The amount of data that\n                            can be stored in either type of sparse image is additionally bounded by the\n                            filesystem in the image and by any partition map.\n\nA sparse image expands as necessary when files are added to it, in contrast to a disk image which actually takes up as much space as you allocate for it.\nBasically, with modern filesystems that support very large files (8EB for HFS+), you're much more likely to hit disk capacity constraints than anything else. It might be more convenient to split your files for network transfers, DVD distribution (as you noticed), and the like.\n\n*Disk Utility doesn't provide a GUI for creating these segments, but you can split an image using hdiutil directly from the command line. You specify the base filename and the size of each segment. An example, directly from the man page:\n\nhdiutil segment -segmentSize 10m -o /tmp/aseg 30m.dmg\n\ncreates aseg.dmg, aseg.002.dmgpart, and aseg.003.dmgpart.\n\nI also found an application called DMGConverter which has a GUI for segmenting disk images.\n\n*You can merge the files using hdiutil convert, for example:\nhdiutil convert firstFile.dmg -format UDRO -o output.dmg\n\nwhich will automatically include the .dmgparts.\n\n*See #4.\n\n\nA: You can reintegrate these files using a command such as the one here\n4.29Gb is the formatted size of a DVD in OSX so you are probably correct that the files were created to sit on DVDs\n", "Q: Can I accept a call on iPhone without manual intervention? I would like to know if I can accept a call without me or any person hitting the accept button?\nIt can happen immediately after receiving the call or after any number of rings, but automatic it should be.\n\nA: There is an app called AutoAnswer, but it only works on jailbroken phones.  If you're into that sort of thing, you can find an article on it here:\nhttp://www.ijailbreak.com/cydia/autoanswer-automatically-answer-specific-numbers-and-facetime-calls-on-your-iphone/\n", "Q: iMac is mysteriously unable to use WiFi that works for all other systems So, my house has Wifi that works pretty consistently with all of our computers, both macs and PC's. However, we just set up our iMac (which runs Snow Leopard) for the first time in a few months, and data just trickles in. It usually connects to the router, but if a page loads at all it will take at least a minute (which is obviously entirely useless). I've tried playing around with AirPort settings a little bit, but nothing has worked. I've also done a good deal of internet searching, but nothing particularly helpful has arisen. So, does anyone have any possible suggestions?\nI should also mention that I brought it to the Genius Bar to have this dealt with. When I was there, however, the store internet worked fine. This was after the employee showed me how to clear the PRAM, so we figured that this was the issue and I left on my merry way. However, the problem was the same back at home, no matter how many times I reset the PRAM.\n\nA: It's not unknown for there to be incompatibilities between two things that are supposedly using the same WiFi standards especially since so many manufacturers departed from or anticipated the standards bodies in producing MIMO, draft-N (or even draft-G devices if you're dealing with something completely ancient). Is there an update available for your device? \nWhat you didn't say was what kind of access point you have in the house and what kind of wireless radios are in the PCs that work. You mentioned Airport but you might have meant the WiFi settings on the menu bar, or if you did mean it is an Apple Airport then it might be an original graphite UFO, a white UFO, an Express or an Extreme. I switched to a current model Airport Extreme (square) in the past year and found speeds and signal strength far better than my previous white UFO Airport Extreme.\nAnother thing to look at is what channel the AP is on. Are there any other access points visible from your house? You might be suffering from collision with a nearby radio and switching the channel in use in your house could help. This old blog fro New Zealand has a good illustration of how various channels overlap, so switching might be worth a try, even if the diagram doesn't seem to suggest you have a conflict.\nFinally - can you just try moving the AP or the machine to see if things improve? It might look like there aren't any wireless obstacles between the AP and your machine, but you might find a thin wall houses a whole lot of copper pipes or foil insulation, and can be a fairly effective wireless shield.\n\nA: Sounds like your internet connection is having some issues with traffic to/from sites.\nCan you open 'Terminal' and type this:\ntraceroute google.com\nthen repeat with\ntraceroute 74.125.47.113\nand put the two results here?\n\nA: A few things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Mac HD > Library > Preferences and delete (or archive) the folder called System Configuration. Reboot. You will have to choose and enter your Network password again. If that doesn't work.\n\n*Create a test user account on your Mac if it does it here too after step one then it's a system wide issue (or your router)...\n\n*Factory reset the router, I had the same problem recently, all other Macs were fine, restarting the router didn't help. Factory resetting the router fixed the issue.\n\n", "Q: Changing my iTunes account details I have a UK account but have relocated to Australia.\nI'm trying desperately to change my account details but the system won't let me as I have £10 credit on my UK account.\nI don't mind losing the £10 I just want to change my details to my new Oz details.\nAnyone know how?\nAlso, is possible to credit the £10 to my Oz account as that would be fantastic.\n\nA: After searching around the internet, it sounds like other people are having this same issue. You could try contacting Apple to get their advice, but it will probably be easier to just spend the £10 credit on something and then try switching again.\n\nA: Remove the credit card from your account first. Then you can spend the £10. \n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes, go to iTunes store.  \n\n*Click the \"down arrow\" next to your email at the top right side of the page and click \"Account.\"\n\n*Enter your username and password and click \"View Account\" to log into your account information.\n\n*Next to your Payment Type, click \"Edit.\"\n\n*Select the \"None\" button and click \"Done.\"\n\n\nYou can confirm your card has been removed by going back to the Apple account info screen and under payment type, it should say that there is no payment information on record. \nThis will make your account work as if it was started with an iTunes gift card. \nFrom there you should be able to switch over the the aussie store. \n\nA: Not true.  The device will still tell you:\n\"you have a store credit balance; you must spend your balance before you can change stores.\".\nTerrible catch-22 situation that Apple has put their global users in.\nI have an amount of $4cents left on my iPhone, but moved to Europe.\nI have no way of spending this amount, so I can start using local European iTune cards.\nCompletely crazy situation!!\n", "Q: Zoom (green) button & Finder list view I am using Finder list view in OSX Lion 10.7.3, and I want to size the window to the contents. I click the zoom (green) button which according to the web 'toggles the window between the “user state” and the “standard state”'.\nHowever, I find that OSX miscalculates and makes the window about 2.5 lines too short to fit the whole file list, unless the list is very small in which case it goes no shorter than a minimum size.\nHow do I avoid this behaviour and size the window to the list correctly?\n\nA: Unfortunately I think you may be out of luck on this one. I tried hiding the toolbar, path bar, status bar, holding down modifier keys — nothing seems to change this behavior. You could check out some third-party utilities to change the zoom button's behavior, but I don't know of anything that will give you the exact behavior you want.\n\nA: As far as I'm concerned, it's a bug - this is a feature that has worked the same way in every version of the Mac OS that I've ever used until Lion. I'm stunned that it still hasn't been fixed after three major 10.7 updates. It defies logic that \"zoom\" would mean anything but \"only make the window large enough to show all of the window contents,\" as it does in Icon view. I'm filing a report right now:\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\nCome on, Apple, fix this.\n", "Q: Does SSH on Mac keep a local cache of data? If I'm say, editing a file in VIM, the state of the remote machine needs to be sent to my Mac. I know that browsers cache images and such. Does SSH do the same? Are there any programs for Mac that do that? Would I be able to use that data to recover remote files?\n\nA: SSH simply allows you to use a shell (command line) on a remote machine; it doesn't cache the data that you access.\nIf you're looking for a solution to back up files from another machine, and Time Machine isn't what you want, perhaps check out rsync.\n", "Q: How significant is the new iPad's heat issue? I've heard a fair bit about problems with the new iPad \"overheating\". However the details seem a bit shaky.\nIs the increase in heat noticeable? Is it only when playing games and watching videos, or is it just from using it for extended time? \nAlso, does the problem only affect some iPads, or is it a general problem (I think some components are made by different manufacturers, eg the screen)? So if you buy a new iPad, is there a chance you'll get one that heats more than it should?\n\nA: As usual Gruber nails the issue to the wall here:\nThe short answer is COMPLETE NON ISSUE.\n\nComparing Temperatures ★\nSam Byford, writing for The Verge, “Tests Show New iPad Runs Up to 18 Percent Hotter Than iPad 2”:\n\nDutch website Tweakers.net has taken an infrared camera to the new\n  iPad and revealed that it runs at up to 33.6 degrees Celsius (92.5\n  Fahrenheit) when running the GLBenchmark — that’s an 18.7 percent\n  increase on the iPad 2, which reached 28.3 degrees Celsius (82.9\n  Fahrenheit).\n\nAs Alex Dedalus points out on Twitter, to say this is a crap headline is give crap headlines a bad name. Celsius and Fahrenheit are relative temperature scales, not absolute, so you can’t do percentage-based comparisons. Think about it: 33.6 / 28.3 gives you an “18.7 percent” increase, but if you do the math with the same temperatures in Fahrenheit, you get 92.5 / 82.9 = “11.6 percent” increase. If you really want to do a percentage based comparison, you need to convert to an absolute temperature scale like Kelvin, which shows you that it’s actually a 1.8 percent increase in temperature (306.75 / 301.45). This is middle school science.\nThat doesn’t make for a good Verge headline though, and neither would “5.3 degrees” (Celsius), so I suggest going with Fahrenheit — “Tests Show New iPad Runs Up to 10 Degrees Hotter Than iPad 2” — to maximize the sensational impact while still being technically true.\n\nA: This is a complete non-issue. Yes, the new iPad gets a little warm in a back corner, but it's not uncomfortable and it's nothing compared to how hot my MacBook gets. It's noticeable, nothing more. Granted, iOS devices, including iPads, can overheat, but that's based on the environment they're in and not how hot they're operating.\n\nA: It's on the borderline.\nVarious reports have been published already. While most blogs say the temperatures are normal - if not - to be expected due to the powerful graphics of the A5X, I like to take a more critical standpoint.\nApple's recommendation for battery temperatures\n\nYour iPad is designed to work in conditions ranging from 32° to 95° F. That’s 0° to 35° C for the metrically inclined. But keeping your iPad as near room temperature as possible (72° F or 22° C) is ideal. (link)\n\n\nApple says that \"Heat will degrade your battery’s performance the most.\"\nTaking this into perspective, the temperatures can be considered slightly harmful to your batteries on the long run. But this is only when you constantly keep your iPad performing at a maximum level (games, Wi-Fi, GPS, Push...).\nMacrumors reported that they managed to achieve maximum temperatures of 133°F which is not good for the battery.\nApples gives advice in this documentation on how to optimize your settings for best battery performance.\n\nA: Not at all. I have noticed that it is warmer when sitting for long periods (i.e. reading in iBooks, playing Hero Academy) but it is not a big deal and not even unpleasant except when the day is hot. If you look at this on a relative scale that I've just made up:\n10 - 2007 MacBook Pro 17\" playing World of Warcraft\n9 - Hell\n8 - Dave's Insanity Sauce\n7 - Chili con carne\n6 - cup of coffee\n5 - iPhone 4 in Personal Hotspot mode\n4 - cup of coffee when you remember to drink the last bit\n3 - New iPad\n2 - Old iPad\n1 - Fonzie\n\nYou get some more perspective.\n\nA: I did indeed notice my Verizon LTE iPad getting warm in the \"bottom left\". (well, bottom left if it's oriented with the home button at the bottom) However, it's not any worse than any other Apple product I've ever owned. My Late 2009 iMac was a lot worse, and that was bearable to touch. This is not quite as severe. I don't think it's an issue. \nHowever, MacRumors says that the new iPad is reported to hit 116 degrees Fahrenheit. That sounds problematic to me. \nAssuming that the reports are true, it's the GPU. If that's the case, it depends on your use case. I'm not planning on springing for Infinity Blade II, but if you are, it might be an issue.\nEdit:\nCnet did some tests and they say it's not yet a problem.\n\nA: *\n\n*34 °C   - The commonly accepted average human skin temperature.\n\n*33.6 °C - The maximum temperature of your iPad 3 when you thrash it's brains out.\n\n\nA problem?  You decide... You can start by asking if you ever worried about burning yourself when you touched yourself.  Have you ever got worried about setting your pants on fire just by sitting in them.  If the answer is no, you are likely just fine\n\nA: I think this is simply another example of media hype.  I agree that there is a temperature difference and that it may make some users a tiny bit uncomfortable while doing extreme gaming.  But is that an issue worthy of national press?  I seriously doubt it.\n\nA: After having used the new iPad for over a week and performing a few tests, I've found that it's noticeably warmer to the touch than the previous generations of iPads, but could not be considered \"hot\" - it isn't uncomfortable to touch or hold.\nI found that even though I don't currently have an active Verizon plan, turning off the cellular connectivity (Settings --> Cellular Data --> Cellular Data OFF) reduced the heating to nothing during normal activities (reading, web use, email, simple games).  It feels about room temperature when the LTE cellular chipset is off.\nThe heat would go up slightly for very graphically intense games, but not to the degree that it increased just having the cellular connection on.\nAs power efficient as the LTE chipset is, it still consumes significant power, even when not actively transmitting data, and that power results in additional heat.  Consider turning it off for those times you know you're going to be in an area with wifi, when you need the battery to last longer, or when you are concerned about the extra warmth.\nThe heating is entirely within the operating temperature range of all the iPad components and humans, so it will not damage the iPad, nor burn anyone under normal use.\n", "Q: restore from time machine without a mac I want to restore a couple files from a time machine chronicle of backups, but I don't have the mac to restore them to.\nHow do I search for files within just using the folder structure\n\nA: You will need an OS that can read the HFS+ filesystem. If you are running Windows, give MacDrive a try. You will have a trial period which will be plenty of time to allow you to at least pull the contents of the drive.\nOnce you access the Time Machine partition, look for the following directory: Backups.backupdb. In there, you will see a folder named after the machine you used to create the backups (e.g., cqm's Mac). Navigating into it will show a list of all the backups, each folder having a unique time stamp. Going into those folders will provide you with the general structure of your Mac (folders like Applications, Library, etc.). You'll want to go into Users and then your username. From there, just browse the contents and pull the files you are in need of.\nTime Machine works by hard linking the files (saves space), but the general structure is identical to that of OS X. So finding things shouldn't be an issue.\n\nHard linking is a neat feature often overlooked. Unlike symlinks, which create a pointer at the OS level to the original file, hard linking actually creates a pointer at the file system level, so for all intents and purposes, they are treated as one file. Let me explain.\nWhen a file is written to the disk, a pointer to that information is also made. When you, for example, delete something, typically the system just removes the pointer. But the data still remains on the disk. This is how recovery software works. It scans for the data and restores that pointer.\nHard linking, creates another pointer to the original data. If you remove one hard link, the other will function without problems (unlike symlinks, which are destroyed when the original file pointer is removed, resulting in a broken link). Finder won't differentiate between a real file and it's respective hard link, but you can see what files are hard linked using the ls command:\n-rw-r--r--  2 cksum  staff  24806 Dec 27 12:02 icon.png\n-rw-r--r--  2 cksum  staff  24806 Dec 27 12:02 icon2.png\n\nAs you can see from the above example, the \"2\" before the username (cksum) denotes that they are hard linked. If you created another hard link (e.g., icon3.png), that number would change to 3. Run an ls on any folder and you'll see that all the files will typically have a 1 before them. This means they are not hard linked.\nAs I said above, Time Machine uses hard links to cut down on the space it requires. And you can do the same. Rather than copying files or working with symlinks, it's possible to hard link content all over, and have your computer treat them as unique content. The beauty of this method is it will not inflate the data stored on your hard drive, since no new data is being written, just a new pointer.\n", "Q: Does AppleCare cover physical wear on MacBook Pros? I have a Mid-2010 MacBook Pro with AppleCare. I've had a few minor/cosmetic hardware issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*My power cord recently started coming apart. The rubber/plastic coating around the MagSafe end of the cord has begun to fray a little bit. I've covered it with electrical tape for now. I did find this question which seems to have a satisfactory answer for this particular issue. But more interestingly:\n\n*The right-front corner of the body is scuffed and losing its silver coating. I haven't put any particular extra stress on this part of the body, but the silver coating is coming off. The left side is fine.\n\n\n*My left command key is starting to wear through. A layer of the material seems to be chipping away slowly; here's a picture where you can see the backlight shining through a few tiny holes. The right command key is fine.\n\nIs it possible that I could get these issues repaired since I have AppleCare? Is it even worth taking in to an Apple Store? If they wouldn't do this for free, how much would they be likely to charge me?\n\nA: Is it worth taking it in? Absolutely! Apple have legendary customer service and will likely fix things they have absolutely no legal obligation to fix.\nThe power cord is absolutely covered. Apple will replace it free of charge under your warranty. As for the weathered keyboard key, they may likely do the same as that shouldn't be happening and a replacement key (which they will likely have a plentiful supply of in the back) costs next to nothing and is trivial to swap.\nAs for the scuffing on the case, they may shy away from that as that is a) a considerable amount of work to do and b) not cheap. But press them and you'll find that they may just acquiesce. The unit should after all retain its coating and they may tell you it's a \"one time cosmetic replacement,\" but will still do the servicing.\nI have personally had them replace my iPhone even though I couldn't reproduce the problem I had reported. My friend had his replaced, free of charge, after he dropped it and admitted to such when bringing it in (he is not alone here, as I have had other friends receive the same treatment). They also overnighted a new battery when my MacBook Pro was 6 months out of warranty!\nI always encourage people to make use of their warranty. Apple's customer service is bar none the best in the world. Truly. They will make you feel like you own part of the company. I cannot express here how good it really is.\nWhile you may not find precedent for them to fix any of those issues, you'll soon find that you won't need to. Apple works to make you happy, and not just to meet some legal requirement.\n\nA: I want to add two things to address the repair - but cksum nailed in on the big picture. Normal wear and tear is excluded from both the warranty and AppleCare by wording, however when it interferes with the operation or might be premature, I've seen coverage in practice.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your mac before the bar appointment and bring in the backup if you are not 100% sure it's perfect and reliable. Better safe than sorry. Repairing the top case is a major repair - not hard, but everything moves into a new case.\n\n*Even if the repair is quoted as out of warranty - $320 covers all cosmetic and non-abuse related damage to most portables with a short (less than a week normally) turn around. You can get good information as part of the quote process, so ask the tech at your appointment how things are repaired.\n\n", "Q: Mirroring iOS device app layouts, find apps more easily when switching devices As an iPhone and iPad user I have many apps in common and I spend a lot of time swiping back and forth on one device looking for an app that I know was in a certain place on the second screen... only I was thinking of the other device and it's actually in the third screen. \nOne scheme I thought of is to map the iPhone's 4x4 grid of icons onto the iPad's 4x5, showing the apps that appear on both devices on the same relative screens on the iPad with iPad-only apps displayed in the bottom row. That way when swiping between screens I could have the same apps on the same numbered screens, with the iPad apps that don't appear on the iPhone in a position that won't confuse things (in the fifth row, assuming portrait orientation - I realise this comes unstuck in landscape but I don't use that much). \nOf course I could sit there for hours arranging manually or doing it the somewhat faster way in iTunes (though I find myself not doing a lot of device syncing since iOS 5.0).\nIs there a way to automate positioning of these apps or could there be a way to Applescript this process? Could any of the enterprise device management tools be used to find apps from a list of known apps and to move them into groups or positions (and of course move the groups too) that are common across devices?\n\nA: Sorry, there is no way to do this apart from restoring from a back up and clonning a device, but that is not ever an option.\nThe only way to do it is to manually move apps around from screen to screen, and like you mentioned the easiest way is in iTunes.\n", "Q: How do I sign out of a Twitter account on the iPhone? When I use an app such as Safari, I can choose to \"Tweet\" a page and it uses my Twitter account. How do I sign out of that Twitter account so that if I give my device to someone else, they can no longer tweet things on my behalf?\n\nA: As of Feb 27, 2023, both the original answer and even the Twitter's existing documentation are not accurate.\nFor the following configuration:\n\n*\n\n*Twitter: version 9.45\n\n*iOS: version 16.0\n\nTo log out:\n\n*\n\n*Tap on your profile icon in the upper left of the screen to open the profile menu\n\n*In this menu, tap the Add Account icon (upper right of menu) to open the Accounts sub-menu. In this menu, you should see your account, and the options to Create a new account or Add an existing account.\n\n*Swipe left on your account to reveal the option to Log out\n\n\nOriginal Answer\nThe only way to sign out of an account is to actually delete it, according to the UI. This is tied into the Twitter integration that was part of iOS 5.\nTo sign out of the account, you need to:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Choose Twitter\n\n*Tap on the account you want to sign out of.\n\n*Tap Delete Account\nThis does not delete your actual Twitter account, it just logs you out and removes that accounts credentials from your device.\n", "Q: How do I install the mobile version of Google Chrome on my iPod touch 4th generation? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan you install Google Chrome on an iOS Device \n\nI want to install Chrome on my iPod touch 4th generation.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: Chrome is currently not available for iOS. Although, Safari itself uses the same Webkit rendering base as Chrome.\nThere are third party browsers in the App Store, but all of these are still just using a WebView (a la Safari) as their backend. The only one that may not is Opera, but that is because everything is rendered on their servers.\n\nA: Chrome and Firefox haven't been developed for iOS yet, but you could try Dolphin Browser. It's very similar to Chrome, and you can download extensions for it.\nOpera Mini and Murcury Web Browser (quite similar to Desktop Safari) are another couple of nice alternatives to Mobile Safari, and Atomic Web Browser is slightly better than Safari, but doesn't have many features.\nIf you want to watch Flash videos on your iPad, try out Skyfire. It's limited, but it does what it says.\nIf you want an interface which looks like Chrome, you might like Diigo Browser. Here's a review of the app which may help.\n\nYou could search for \"browser\" on the app store, but realize that most of the applications that you find will still be using the same rendering engine that Apple developed. It's only the stuff around the rendering engine that will look different.\nThere are some rumors that Firefox will eventually release an iOS version.\nPersonally though, I prefer Dolphin as my favorite. :3\nDolphin Browser\n\n*\n\n*Gestures: create a personal symbol to access the websites you use the most\n\n*Visit your favorite sites with one touch.\n\n*Tabbed browsing\n\n*Bookmarks Bar\n\n*Full Screen Mode\n\n\n\nA: Chrome and Firefox haven't been developed for iOS yet, but you could try Dolphin Browser. It's very similar to Chrome, and you can download extensions for it. Personally, Dolphin is my favorite. Opera Mini and Murcury Web Browser (quite similar to Desktop Safari) are another couple alternatives to Mobile Safari, and Atomic Web Browser is slightly better than Safari, but doesn't have many features. If you want to watch Flash videos on your device, try out Skyfire. It's limited, but it does what it says. There are plenty more browsers out there for iOS, but these are the ones I use most.\n\nA: Unless it is in the App Store, that will involve first jail breaking your device, and then compiling it yourself (or else finding a trusted source). I think you'll find it impossible at present.\n", "Q: Is there a Bowtie theme that looks like a Flurry icon? I have a number of Flurry icons on my desktop linked to applications I use frequently. I envision an almost identical looking icon, but instead of an icon and filename, it displays the album art and track name of the currently playing song using Bowtie.\nIs there such a theme in existence? If not, what's the easiest way to create one from scratch?\n(Info about developing themes for Bowtie can be found here. It's mostly HTML and CSS.)\n\nA: You could start by adapting the default theme that comes bundled with Bowtie and is just HTML/CSS as well. Copy it from the application bundle (Bowtie.app/Contents/Themes/Default.bowtie) to ~/Library/Application Support/Bowtie and rename to e.g. Flurry.bowtie.\nMake sure to edit all information in the contained .plist file, especially name (BTThemeName) and identifier (BTThemeIdentifier) to custom, unique values.\nTo get from this theme to something more like Flurry, the following need to be changed:\n\n\n*\n\n*-webkit-border-radius in #artHolder (I used 18px)\n\n*-webkit-box-shadow, same location (e.g. 0px 0px 4px #000)\n\n*width and height, same location (I used 96px).\n\n*Remove the img tag referencing img/gloss.png.\n\n\nThe result will look like this:\n\nWhat's missing is a proper border and maybe some glossy overlay. The file img/gloss.png in the theme produces the glossy overlay effect in the default theme. Replace the image file with your own containing a border and some highlight at the top matching the Flurry style. I shamelessly ripped the AirPort Flurry icon apart for this, deleted the background and border contents, and used the result as overlay image. Don't do this unless you know as little about image editing as I do.\nThe position of the border will be off by a few pixels. Play around with the top and left values in the image CSS until it matches the cover art. Change cover art size or border image size until they match as needed.\nThis is what it looks like on a darker background now:\n\nNow, this is missing the light highlights at the top and some glossy effect, but this is about all I am able to do in an image editor.\n\nOf course, this is just a rough outline. Much depends on the detailed requirements you need to work out yourself, e.g. whether you also want to flip the cover image to get the controls, and how they should look like.\nI'm not sure about the licensing here. To be on the safe side, especially if you want to publish your theme, make it original, especially the border/overlay image.\n", "Q: Can Numbers save a file as CSV? I'm trying to switch over from Excel to Numbers. Is it possible to save a file as a CSV in Numbers?\nThe whole idea behind this is I prefer to have my documents on the cloud as well as on Numbers for my iPad and iPhone. I do not do typical data sheets, I manage database files so I do not need any features, I just need to be able to work with CSV files.\n\nA: Saving out and reading in CSV is simple for Numbers. (And perchance you should wonder, the autocorrect runs from the system service, so turning that off will disable that as well for you.)\n\nA: Yes, Numbers can export CSV files.\nGo to File » Export and click the CSV tab.\n\n\nA: You can't save your projects as csv but you can export to csv. Which is kinda the same thing. \nRegarding autocorrecting numbers, I'm not entirely sure what that means in your context but if the cell text format is the correct one it'll leave them alone. \n", "Q: Can I uninstall the Messages Beta? I'm thinking about trying the Messages Beta on OS X Lion. I'm wondering if I will be able to uninstall it if I don't want to use it anymore. If so, will I be able to use iChat again?\n\nA: Yes. \nIn the Messages menu, there's an option to uninstall the beta. Apple just messes with the App bundle to add support for the iMessage protocol. The underlying app is pretty much the same.\nSee this AskDifferent Answer and this post which it references for more information.\n\nA: You can choose uninstall Messages Beta from the menu.\n\n", "Q: How do I copy text from another application without switching to it?

When I open a CSV file in Numbers, it \"helpfully\" converts fields it recognizes as numeric by stripping leading zeros, converting things it recognizes as dates, etc.\nTake for example, you type a UPC code into a Numbers spreadsheet 005566778899, Numbers will automatically convert that to 5566778899. This is not what I would want...\nHowever, the way I use Numbers, I open databases with thousands of UPC codes with preceding zeroes. Some of them also contain dates which Numbers will also reformat. Basically I do not want any of these features, I want my content to be left alone.\nHow can I get Numbers to leave my data intact when I open a CSV file?\nConverting the fields to text after importing won't help since the data was already messed with...\n\nA: If a field in a CSV file begins with an apostrophe ('), both Excel and Numbers will treat the field as text, and not render it with any numerical formatting.\nYour CSV files appear to try to force text rendering through enclosing number fields in double quotes, but Numbers and Excel don't seem to take the hint that double quote numbers should be treated as strings. The trick seems to be to modify the CSV files so they use the \"starts with a single apostrophe\" trick rather than the \"contained in double quotes\" trick for numeric fields, but keep the double quotes for text fields involving punctuation (including commas, quotation marks, line breaks, etc).\nTo process your CSV files so they do this, you can create an Automator application.\nIn Automator, create a new Application.\nIt will have a single action: Run Shell Script (passing input as arguments). Here is the script:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    perl -pi -e \"s/\\\"\\\"([0-9A-Za-z: \\.\\-+]+)\\\"/'\\1/g\" \"$f\"\ndone\n\nSave the resulting application on your Desktop. Drop any CSV files you want to use in Numbers on the application icon, and they will be converted so Numbers should keep the numbers in the fields as literal numbers, and not format them or throw away information.\nBack up your data before trying this; it is possible that a particularly oddly constructed string in a record field could throw off the results here.\n\n\nA: Specifically, here's how to handle leading zeros. I think your question is more about cell formatting than autocorrect.\nAs was mentioned the autocorrect feature itself is a system item, and needs to be disabled from System Preferences.\n\nA: Huzzah, thanks to this answer and others, there is now a method with the following benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*Works in Excel as well as Numbers\n\n*Can be automated.\n\n*Is invisible in Numbers.\n\n*Produces zero-impact CSV files from import to export.\n\n\nThe trick is to not prefix each field with an apostrophe nor wrap in double quotes, but to prefix with =\" and suffix with \". On import Numbers treats the field contents as a string and on export it drops the prefix and suffix.\nHere's a handy one liner that pre-processes a file called my.csv:\nsed 's/^/=\"/;s/,/\",=\"/g;s/$/\"/' my.csv | sed 's/=\"\"//g' > tmp.csv\n\nThe first sed puts =\" at the start of each line, changes each comma to \",=\", then ends each line with \". The second sed then strips out any empty fields, because Numbers chokes on them. Finally it writes a file called tmp.csv that can be doubled clicked or passed to open to import into Numbers.\nIn practice this will garble any fields that have commas in them. You might be better off only wrapping those fields that start with numbers, but then you need to be careful with the start and end of each line and your version of regular expressions. This will do on macOS:\nsed -E 's/(^|,)([[:digit:]][^,]*)($|,)/\\1=\"\\2\"\\3/g'\n\nThat is, match the start of the line or a comma, a digit and then any number of characters that aren't commas, then the end of the line or another comma. Replace with the same beginning and end, but with the middle bit wrapped in =\" and \".\n", "Q: Disable Kerberos / Single Sign-on We have a Mac mini running OS X 10.7 Server which has a number of shared folders/drives using AFP. We have a user account called fcp setup as sharing only which coworkers use to access the shared files. \nWhenever a coworker clicks on the machine in finder we get prompted for a Kerberos password:\n\nWe can get around this simply by clicking cancel (and we are then presented with the classic login window), but it confuses people.\nHow can I disable single signon/kerberos?

So to access a development server I use something like http://localhost:8888 which is forwarded to port 80 on a remote host.\nIs there a way to simplify my setup with custom domains? For instance, I want to be able to type in http://remote.dev and actually be accessing http://localhost:8888?\n\nA: DNS and hosts are only for domain mapping of IP addresses. Ports aren't part of a domain, and according to this post, it cannot be done in the way you're asking. There is an alternative solution mentioned there, but things can get messy when modifying firewall tables. Essentially what you have to do is redirect 127.0.0.1:8888 to a remote server (you'll have to know the IP address of the server, and it'll have to be unique). That being said, it is possible, but may not be worth the effort or potential consequences.\n", "Q: How do I temporarily disable applications from starting up at login? Is there any way to temporarily disable applications from starting up at login? I'm referring to both Lion apps that are started due to the resume/reopen feature, and also to applications set to launch in the Login Items setting.\nI know that I can disable the apps from launching in Lion by unchecking the relevant checkbox right before I shut down, but what if I forget to do this, or if I decide I don't want them to start up right before I login?\nTo clarify: I'm looking for a one-time, temporary solution rather than something that will disable them all the time.\n\nA: Hold the shift key as the user log in process starts.\nYou need to hop on the shift key quickly if you enter a password right after pressing return, get on the shift.\nIf your account logs in automatically, look to get on the shift when you see the gray screen with the dark grey apple logo. Next comes the blue screen and then the graphical user log in portion. If you hold the shift too early (before the Apple logo) you will have a safe boot(not what you want) \nA safe boot has much more temporarily disabled than just the user log in items.\nSee the Apple knowledge base article for more information about items that open automatically at start up and how the shift key trick works.\n", "Q: What does Mail do when you try to quit it? For some reason, Mail takes significantly longer than most of my other apps to quit. It might become unresponsive for a period of time after I hit [command]+[q] before it actually quits. What is taking Mail so long to quit?\n\nA: Turn on the Activity window to see what's going on. You probably have it set to purge deleted emails or some other shutdown maintenance. Press command-option-0 (command-0 if you're not on Lion 10.7) to see it or select from the Window menu.\nI keep the Activity window up all the time just to see what's going on. But then, I have to monitor about 30 different email accounts for various work-related reasons.\n\nA: Mail is like many apps that use the network - it can't just quit if there is network traffic active, it needs to see those requests safely terminated. If for example Mail is checking your iCloud account it needs to wait a certain time until all processes are complete before exiting. It may also be sending an email that you have just hit \"Send\" on,  and then you have immediately tried to quit - can't work that way. Even if the network communication is asynchronous these things need to be tidied up before exiting.\n", "Q: How can I install Adobe Flash manually or without giving root access? Background info:\nI've locked down my /Library folder so even the admin group can't write (only root can).\nThe Adobe update app opens the password dialog when I click \"install\". Is it possible to install without giving root access to this executable?\nThe ps command says the installer is running as $TMPDIR/FPUnpackPath/Install Adobe Flash Player.app/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Flash Player Install Manager. That file is a compiled binary (Mach-O).\nI also found a single dpkg directory: Contents/Resources/Adobe Flash Player.pkg. Under this is Contents/Archive.pax.gz. The file list looks innocent enough, my existing installation seems to have the files under /Library.\nWould the install be clean if I just run the dpkg file, rather than proceeding with their Mach-O binary? I take it that running the dpkg is safer?\n(I have a feeling that the Mach-O only does installation-support stuff like making sure the old files aren't in use before replacing.)\nPlease support your answer with evidence, don't merely speculate.\nBtw, Cmd-I when the Installer app is running will list the contents. Very nice. (See How can I open a .pkg file manually?)\n\nA: Download the dmg from Adobe's website. Mount it and right click on the Install Adobe Flash Player.app and select \"Show Package Contents.\"\nDrill down into Contents > Resources:\n\nLaunch the Adobe Flash Player.pkg:\n\nWhen the plugin installer launches, go to File > Show Files (or CMD + I).\n\nThere you will see a list of the files it installs and where. You'll need to use something like Pacifist to extract the contents, but once you do, you can install the files manually. And yes, the install would be just as clean if you used the pkg to install the plugin. It's not any safer, it's just an alternate route that doesn't have the Adobe wrapper (so it doesn't use Adobe's proprietary installer).\n\nA: If you need to install Flash Player.plugin manually, I've found a workaround, but it's a bit of a pain due to how Adobe packages it. For this you will need Pacifist by CharlesSoft or another tool capable of opening macOS installer packages (or find out how to extract what you need using pkgutil), you also need a full download of the Flash Player plugin (not the internet enabled one), the correct download should be a disk image of around 15-16mb.\nSteps are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, mount install_flash_player_osx.dmg\n\n*In the Flash Player disk image, right click \"Install Adobe Flash Player\" and choose \"Show Package Contents\".\n\n*Inside the package, open Contents, then Resources, and open Adobe Flash Player.pkg in Pacifist (or similar, or get ready to use pkgutil to do it).\n\n*If you already have Flash Player.plugin installed under ~/Library/Internet/Plug-Ins, you may wish to take a copy of it as a backup.\n\n*In the contents of the installer package (the BOM file), locate Flash Player.plugin.lzma and flashplayer.xpt under Library and Internet Plug-Ins, and copy them to your ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins folder.\n\n*In the resources for the installer package, locate the finalize tool under Scripts and copy it somewhere.\n\n*Finally, run the following command in Terminal.app (with the correct path to finalize): /path/to/finalize \"$HOME\"\nAfter completing the last step, the Flash Player.plugin.lzma file should be decompressed as Flash Player.plugin, overwriting any previous plugin. If you have a Flash enabled browser open, you'll need to restart it to use the new plugin.\nIf you'd rather not do this using your plugins folder, and just want to get a decompressed version of the plugin, then you don't have to; all the finalize tool wants is an install location, under which it will then look for Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Flash Player.plugin.lzma. You could therefore decompress it from your Downloads folder by copying the plugin to ~/Downloads/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Flash Player.plugin.lzma and then running /path/to/finalize ~/Downloads.\nOf course, Flash support is ending soon, but it may stick around in some browsers like FireFox for a while, so I thought it would be good to document how to manually install rather than installing as root along with all the other crap the installer adds (launch agents, preference pane etc.). If you want a way to play .swf files without a browser, you should look for a standalone Flash player, such as the Adobe Flash Projector.\n", "Q: longevity of iPad Smart Cover Since the launch of the iPad 2 I have been using a cover that I painted so I am reluctant to replace it. However the inside surface of the cover seems to be thinning or just becoming generally less fuzzy and it is doing less to clean the screen. In particular it is leaving vertical stripes that don't get cleaned. What kind of time are people getting out of their covers and is there any way to rejuvenate them or is there any material thin enough and effective at cleaning that can be bonded to the inside of the cover?\nThis cover dates from iPad 2 launch - have these covers changed during their lifetime or are they still the same inside and out? I know they have not changed specifically for \"new iPad\" but I read one forum post that claimed the inside material had changed.\n\nLooks to me like the leather covers might be less resilient - I saw one only about six months old that looked very shiny and polished inside, like worn suede.\n\nA: The smart covers, generally do leave the vertical stripes. This happens when the fold areas of the cover do not touch the screen when it is closed. If you remove the smart cover fold it up and hold it horizontaly while wiping down the screen you will remove these stripes. \nI have found that after owning 2 covers, both ployuretherene, that the microfiber lininng does start to fade away, but this like most things will be determined by the amount of use, and whether you take care of the cover.\nTry not to let the microfiber part touch any dirty surfaces when it is off, or you are using it as a stand.\nTo clean the microfiber lining you are better to use another microfiber cloth.\nThey have changed since first release. My first one was a lighter green on the outside and grey on the inside, the covers now all have matching inside colours and slightly more contrast in the clolour of the outside\n", "Q: How to install Xcode from downloaded package I recently uninstalled all dev tools from OS X after having issues with gcc and realizing both Xcode 3 and 4 were installed - but not before saving an Xcode package file to the desktop. It's over 3 GB and I assumed that in some way I could use that to re-install it.\nHow can I use it to re-install Xcode?\nThe purpose for re-installing is so that I know for certain that the latest version of Xcode is being used for any future attempts at compiling code which I call from the terminal (for a local build of Google's V8).\nP.S. Do I even need to re-install at all? I don't understand why double-clicking on this 3 GB Xcode file does seem to load the IDE just fine which seems to indicate it's relying on compilation tools and other components held inside the package, rather than looking for them elsewhere in the system. (Which I imagine should be the case considering the fact that I just *un*installed dev tools from OS X.)\n\nA: The latest Xcode (4.3) does in fact come in its own stand-alone package, so it will run independently of whatever you have in /Developer. Once installed it lives in Applications like every other app on your system. You will probably find (or have found) that it requests permission to install other parts of itself as required. \nIf it is not in /Applications, just drag it there - simple as installing any other app. This is a big change from the bad old days of having it in /Developer and having to be careful about removing versions with \nsudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools –mode=all\n\n(Once you have no need for the old Xcode you can get rid of it like that, and you should do that rather than just putting it in the trash or rm'ing.)\nOnce the basic Xcode app is available in Applications you can drag it into the dock, again just like any other app. The support applications, like Instruments or FileMerge or OpenGL ES Performance Detective used to live with Xcode in /Developer but now they can be found under the Open Developer Tool > option in the menu bar's Xcode menu.\nSome people like to have these frequently-used apps available in the dock; FileMerge for one is useful at times other than when you're running Xcode. You can find them all in the Xcode app bundle, if you navigate to it in the finder and use Show Package Contents in the right-click contextual menu. The stand-alone tools live under Xcode/Contents/Applications and you can drag them into the dock like any app.\nNow the basic install of Xcode does not include everything you might need. You should also take a look in Xcode Preferences under the Downloads tab, and at a minimum install the command line tools - it's a smallish download and doing it immediately will save you waiting later. Under Documentation you will find the option to download Documentation bundles for various APIs. If you don't do this then Xcode will go and fetch documents from the web as you require them. It is much faster to have them installed locally.\nXcode is improving rapidly and this change to the way Xcode installs is really helping to simplify updates and moving Xcode to the status of a \"normal\" app that installs and interacts with the system the way we are used to apps behaving. The last update with this new scheme was a simple 80MB download initiated from the Mac App Store - compare with previous versions where an upgrade meant downloading 4GB and replacing everything!\n\nA: As Adam stated, Xcode 4.3 switched over to being a self-contained application.  I would suggest uninstalling the old version of Xcode as he stated, then just copying the new .app over into your Applications folder.  Finally, delete the whole /Developer directory.\n\nHowever, Apple decided to make the mistake of not updating the paths for the development tools.  So, you need to update those paths manually.  If you've put Xcode in your Applications folder, you can run the following in Terminal to switch the paths over to your new app location:\nsudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\n\nIf you need to check the current path, you can do the following:\nxcode-select -print-path\n\n", "Q: Make Spotlight indexing use less CPU? Whenever spotlight begins indexing my files, my computer's fan starts spinning like crazy. Is there any way to essentially tell spotlight that it doesn't need to finish as quickly as possible, and that I would rather it take longer and use less of my CPU percentage at a given time? (I.e. reduce fan noise.)\nOne thing I noticed is that Spotlight was causing Sophos Anti-Virus's InterCheck process to run at near 100% CPU. By disabling Sophos' \"on-access scanner\", my CPU usage is less, but still hovers around 50% occasionally. \n\nA: You cannot configure how fast Spotlight will index files. Normally, it should auto-throttle itself and not cause massive CPU usage (unless fully rebuilding indexes or doing first-time indexing).\nIf you run into trouble with Sophos and Spotlight, you could tell Sophos to ignore Spotlight's metadata folder. Also, note that there a lot of grief about Sophos interfering with spotlight: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3562174?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: How to Run the Spotlight indexer at a lower priority to reduce CPU load on your Mac\nIMPORTANT!: \nThis procedure has been successfully applied to OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion), OS 10.7 (Lion), and OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard).\nDo NOT attempt this procedure on OS 10.9 (Mavericks)! The mds daemon functions differently and cannot have its processing priority lowered.

I recently bought a iPod Classic (160 GB).\nWhen I try to sync the iPod with my computer, it produces a \"Not enough space\" error, and copies no music to the iPod.\nI would expect it to sync some portion of my library, and ideally rotate the synced portion every time it is connected.\nIs this normal behaviour, or is something broken?\nIf it is normal behaviour, is there any way to make itunes sync a random subset of the music in my library, until it fills the iPod?\n\nA: I believe that you can create a smart playlist, limit it to 160 GB (chosen randomly), and then choose to sync only that playlist. At least you can do something like this with an iPhone.\n\n\nA: Well, I wound up looking into Senseful's answer, and found a better way in the process.\nIf you go to the \"Music\" tab for your iPod, and change the \"Sync Music\" radio-button to \"Selected playlists, artists, albums and genres\", an option \"Automatically fill free space with songs\" become available.\nChecking that seems to do what I want.\n \n", "Q: Does Find my Mac work if you boot into Windows on BootCamp? If I have Find my Mac set up and Bootcamp is installed as well, will my computer be trackable when I'm in Windows?\nWhat happens if a thief steals my computer and remains in Windows all the time, will I ever be able to track the laptop?\n\nA: No. The service requires you to be running OS X (Lion specifically) and to have a recovery partition installed (created by Lion during installation).

I should have used only about 80 gigabytes, but according to DaisyDisk about 25 gigabytes is taken up by hidden space. The mystery disk space seems to be classified as other in the About This Mac window.\n\nI've disabled local Time Machine snapshots with sudo tmutil disablelocal and deleted /Volumes/MobileBackups/.\nDoes anyone know what the hidden space could be or how I could free it up?\nPossibly related to Macbook HD \"Other\" all the Sudden Almost Full.\n\nA: Starting up from the recovery partition and repairing the disk fixed the issue. (Disk Utility showed an error about an invalid free block count.) Thanks @cksum.\n\nA: DaisyDisk's hidden space (if scanned as administrator) should be within 4-8GB limit for most Macs. If the numbers are larger, try repairing the volume as this may serve an indicator for file system errors.\nTaras Brizitsky, DaisyDisk's designer.\n\nA: Another possibility—and one that ended up being the culprit in my particular case—is that your machine is making local backups when it's unable to connect to your external backup source. In this case, you can just disable the backups by entering the following command in the Terminal:\n\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nLater, if and when you decide to re-enable the backup, you can reverse it with the following Terminal command:\n\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\n\n\nUpdate for MacOS Sierra and Later\nIt seems like the disablelocal and enablelocal commands are no longer available. As an alternative you can delete local snapshots by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a list of the local snapshots by running:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots\nYou should get some output like\n\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2018-10-03-145245. \n\n\n*Delete a snapshot by running:\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots <date of snapshot>\nSo, for example, using the output from step 1, you would run:\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2018-10-03-145245\nAnd you should get some output like\n\nDeleted local snapshot '2018-10-03-145245'\n\n\nA: According to DaisyDisk manual:\n\nSometimes the amount of \"used\" space on a disk may appear greater than the total size of all scanned files and folders on that disk. This is normal. The difference is usually taken by the file system overhead and system stuff like Spotlight index, but in certain cases a significant amount of disk space may be hiding in other users' accounts or folders that are normally not visible to you. In order to reveal those folders you should scan the disk as administrator.\n(Hidden space) is a virtual disk map item that only appears when the total size of restricted files is significant, so you can see whether it's worth rescanning the disk as administrator or not.\nLarge amounts of hidden disk space may also indicate to file system errors. Follow our troubleshooting guide for details.\n\nIn case you have a lot of hidden disk space when running it as administrator, it's possible that you have file system errors or broken file permissions.\n\nA: I noticed this folder /.MobileBackups.trash was taking a lot of space (62GB!). Check yours with sudo du -hs /.MobileBackups.trash\nJust ran sudo rm -rf /.MobileBackups.trash and got my space back.\n\nA: In my case I was missing 771 Gigs of space. I had to clear my /cores folder. Apparently an application was crashing and leaving core dumps the amount of space missing was the exact amount of disk space in the cores folder.\n\nA: Another possible culprit could be homebrew (if you are using it). By default, it keeps old vesions of the installed packages after updates. In my case, this summed up to ~11GB. Run brew cleanup -n to see how much space these backups take up on your machine (this won't delete anything yet. To do so, leave out the -n flag).\nSource: https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/44a4b95cdd-homebrew-is-eating-up-your-harddrive\n\nA: In my case 40GB was missing, and by using DaisyDisk Pro I had it isolated to root, which I was denied permission to look into.\nVia Command ⌘ + I I gave myself permission, and found a partial systems Library folder with old sound files for Garageband and logic.\nI have no idea how or what - and some of the folders in that Library folder has today's date, e.g. Keychains, which has me worried a bit.

They are often left hanging in \"Waiting...\" mode for several hours until they get installed. I can stop the \"Waiting...\" process by removing the app and trying to install it again, but it still waits for a while until it installs.\nThis never happened before as apps used to get installed instantly. Is this normal in newer iOS version or is there something wrong?\nPS. This is happening on WiFi.\n\nA: I had the same problem after upgrading to iOS 5.1. In addition to the issues you mentioned, the Music app got really slow after start up, taking up to 10 seconds to respond to my taps and touch gestures.\nAs I couldn’t find a simple solution to the problem, I ended up restoring my iPhone to factory defaults (this is basically a clean iOS 5.1 install) and started over. This fixed my problem.\nUpdate: Seems like there is a workaround:\n\nIf you’re trying to install a handful of iOS apps and your entire home\n  screen is filled with app icons labeled “Waiting…” without any of the\n  progress bars moving, downloading, or installing, you can fix this\n  fairly easily with the two methods below. Try the first method before\n  going nuclear with a reboot though:\nTap a single app icon so that it says “Paused” and then tap that app\n  icon again to see if it resumes downloading If pausing and resuming\n  didn’t work: Reboot the iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch You may notice a\n  related issue where apps from the App Store will say they’re\n  “Installing” though they aren’t appearing on the iOS home screen yet,\n  that is also resolved with a reboot.\nIt’s not totally clear what causes this, though it seems that a lot of\n  people are encountering the problem right now when moving from an old\n  iPad to a new one. It could be that Apple’s servers are just\n  overloaded with downloads from the App Store, or it could be a bug.\n\n\nA: Turn off your iOS device with a total shutdown, then boot up again. That worked for me; my downloads reset and restarted.\n\nA: Had the same problem. Try the usual: restart iOS device, sign out and back into the iStore, sync with iTunes - but nothing helped, then I found following solution on 'iOS apps “could not be purchased at this time”' and the deleting of the downloads.*.sqlitedb helped. \n\nA: This problem seems to have appeared recently (maybe after the iOS 5.1 update).\nI think it is related to the amount of free storage space left as on my iPad with 3 GB left this does not happen and on my iPhone it happens when I have very large (1GB to 1.7GB) applications updating.\nSyncing the iPhone with the computer solves the issue until the next update. Freeing some space seems to solve the issue until the iPhone gets cluttered again.\n\nA: OSX Daily had a good blog post on that. http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/17/fix-ios-apps-stuck-on-waiting/\n\nA: I have found that putting your phone into airplane mode and then turning it back off will help this once it has to be done again next app update or install.

However this requires some manual steps and takes a while (exporting will copy and resize pictures).\nAnother approach I tried is to create symlinks to starred photos in a folder (like this) and sync that with the iPhone. This also requires some manual steps but it's a bit faster to generate the folder. However, syncing with iPhone via iTunes takes a lot of time because iTunes will resize the pictures (actually it rebuilds some sort of \"iPod photo cache\").\nI keep hoping there's a simpler way to do this!\n\nA: You could set up the symlink script to run daily (or however often you possibly sync your device) to at least generate the symlink folder automatically. If you are uncomfortable writing the plists for the LaunchDeamons, you can use an app like Lingon to generate them. At this point, they may not even need to be symlinks, just a copied 'export' if you will, using the same logic.\nEither way, you are still stuck doing the 'iPod Photo Cache'. I think the only reason this is slightly faster when using Aperture or iPhoto is due to them having various thumbnails and other sizes rendered, but it still takes time to process, especially the first time.\nAssuming smaller files would actually process faster, you could also update the script that exports the stared items with symlinks to actually copy the files elsewhere, and then resize them using a tool like sips.  \nFor example, sips -Z 1024 image.jpg would resize the image down to 1024x768, retaining the aspect ration (more examples can be found on this blog, or elsewhere online).\nYou may have to find which process works best for you and your workflow, and where the bottle neck would be. Again, if this export could be daily, outside of the actual sync to your device, that folder could always 'be ready'. \nThen, you just keep your iOS device sync the same, but it can process smaller files, and you have automated most of the process. The iPod Photo Cache may also be incremental, so if these files stay the same, and then just have new ones added, only the new ones are added to the cache as well. \n\nA: So far it seems the best way to do it is to run the following bat script (Windows 7) periodically:\n@ECHO OFF\nSETLOCAL\n\nC:\nCD \\\nCD\n\nRMDIR /S /Q starred\n\nMKDIR starred\n\nPUSHD starred\n\n@FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%a IN    (%userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Picasa2\\db3\\starlist.txt) DO @(\n    ::ECHO %%a\n    CALL :get_path \"%%a\"\n)\n\nPOPD\n\nGOTO last\n\n\n:get_path\n:: get file path\nSET _path=%~p1\n:: get file name and extension\nSET _name=%~nx1\n:: remove trailing backslash from path\nSET _path=%_path:~0,-1%\n:: trim path\nCALL :trim_path \"%_path%\"\nIF NOT EXIST \"%_path%\\\" (MKDIR \"%_path%\")\nPUSHD \"%_path%\"\nMKLINK \"%_name%\" %1\nPOPD\nGOTO :eof\n\n:trim_path\n:: get file name from a path returns the last folder\nSET _path=%~nx1\nGOTO :eof\n\n:last\nCD\nPAUSE\nECHO ON\n\nThis will leave me with a folder full of symlinks (C:\\starred\\), neatly organized in subfolders, which I will sync with my iDevices.\n", "Q: Modifying \"User interface sound effects\" with applescript Good morning all,\nI would like to be able to turn the system sounds on my mac off (and back on) with an applescript activated as an extension for Alfred.\nI have little knowledge of applescripts but I have found that I can open the system preference pane. How do I check and uncheck the \"Play user interface sound effects\" and \"Play feedback when volume is changed\" check boxes?\n\nThe start of my code is as follows\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to activate (reveal anchor \"effects\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\")\n\nThanks guys\n\nA: System Preferences and the Sounds prefpane don't have direct ways to script this. But you can use regular UI scripting in AppleScript:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"effects\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        if value of theBox is not 1 then\n            click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nOr if you want to set a certain value rather than just toggle the checkbox:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"effects\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        set theBox to checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1\n        if value of theBox is not 1 then -- or \"is 1\"\n            click theBox\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nYou can also explicitly say checkbox \"Play user interface sound effects\" of ... instead of just checkbox 1, but I'm not sure how this behaves with localizations.\n", "Q: Why does a \"SAMSUNG_Android\" network service keep appearing? I recently noticed a strange service in the Network preferences called \"SAMSUNG_Android\", which seems to be configured as a modem:\n\n\nI don't have an Android or Samsung device and I've never plugged one into my computer. The only things I've recently plugged in are an iPhone, iPad, and Sony camera.\nI noticed this yesterday, and deleted the service. Today, it's back!\nWhere could this be coming from, and how can I make it go away for good?\n\nA: This looks like someone near you has a Samsung Android device with the ability to create a personal WiFi hotspot.\nYour computer WiFi is able to detect this so will add it to your list of available networks. You might try disabling the prompt to join new networks if you don't want your Mac polling for open and closed hotspots and cluttering up your network connection profile if you cannot isolate or control for the source of this hotspot.\n\nA: I began noticing the \"SAMSUNG_Android\" preference (via a message from a pop-up dialog box every time I connected my Samsung Galaxy S II to charge on the USB cable) shortly after I'd installed Kies on my MacBook.\nI've just Un-installed Kies gracefully by using the uninstaller and no longer receive the pop-ups when attaching my phone to USB, nor does the Samsung network appear in my network preferences. \n\nA: Did you by any chance install the Android SDK? Apparently, installing it create this network interface.\n", "Q: iTunes Match and syncing iOS device with iTunes Library Is it possible to have iTunes match turned on, on my device/itunes. And then sync songs from my iTunes Library to the device.\nAt the moment my internet connection is very slow, so downloading all the songs I want to listen too takes time, it would be easier if I'm near my computer to sync with a local library.\n\nA: Currently, no. If you are using iTunes Match, it takes over playlist and music syncing for you. \nThe only way to get around this currently is to disable iTunes Match on the device, and then you can do a cable or wifi sync like you have been able to do. Match just gives you access to your library anywhere, so if its smaller than the device size, you can just sync everything. Or if you don't always need that access, then just cary what you want with you. iTunes Match will still be helpful for upgrading bit rates of files, as well as if you have other machines with a better internet connection.\nFinally, you can also submit a feature request to Apple at the iTunes Feedback Page. For example, make a request to do local network syncing before iTunes Match syncing if the file exists on your local network. Dropbox somewhat works this way with their LAN sync - items are synced on your network first, and then any other changes are pulled down from the 'cloud'. \n\nA: A possible alternative to what jmlumpkin said, would be to use the Share Library feature. \nOf course it will only work when you're in the same network.\n\nEnable that (add a password for security) and you should see your shared library on your other computer. This has a few limitations (you can't copy the music) but at least it lets you listen to your music without the need to download from the Cloud. \n", "Q: Can Apple refuse service under warranty if an iPhone presents only some scratches? One morning I found that one corner of my iPhone was hit and there is a scratch on the metal and the small plastic border around the glass. The glass is in perfect shape.\nNow, I encounter an overheating problem with the phone and I want to go to Apple but I'm wondering if I could have problems with the warranty due to this.\n\nA: I have had some personal experience with this type of warranty problem. I had an iPhone 3GS which had stress cracks in the white case. I left the phone in my pocket the day before my genius appointment, and hey presto it went in the washing machnie.\nIt came out dead! I took it in, told the gyt what had happened, he took one look at the cracks, and replaced the unit.\nLegaly with warranties - if there was a problem with the product at the time of purchase you are able to take a refund without any quibble.\nGoing back to your specfic case, a few scratches on the phone will go down to standard wear and tear, and cannot be expected to be the cause of overheatingt. Obviously if the scratches are deep so deep in fact the phone is in bits then they won't refund or replace.\n\nA: Before seeking a repair, you might want to do some troubleshooting of your own. Sometimes a runaway process can cause an iPhone to overheat. Chris Breen provides some tips in Troubleshooting a battery-sucking iPhone 4S. I solved a problem I had with my own overheating iPhone 4 by wiping the phone and reinstalling the OS. I did a fresh install, I didn't restore the phone from a backup. (This was when iOS 5 was first release, many of these problems have been sorted out now by OS updates.)\nIf you can't solve the problem yourself the next step is to take the phone to an authorized Apple repair center, in general an Apple Store. Which brings the warranty into play:\nFrom Apple's (US) warranty for the iPhone 4\n\nThis warranty does not apply: (a) to consumable parts, such as\n  batteries or protective coatings that are designed to diminish over\n  time, unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or\n  workmanship; (b) to cosmetic damage, including but not limited to\n  scratches, dents and broken plastic on ports; (c) to damage caused by\n  use with another product; (d) to damage caused by accident, abuse,\n  misuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other external cause; (e)\n  to damage caused by operating the Apple Product outside\n\nThey're not going to cover damage caused by misuse and they're not obligated to replace parts to fix cosmetic damage made by the user, though they will if its is a manufacturing or design fault. Your attitude when dealing with the Genius/Repair Tech may influence the outcome so I advocate being polite, pleasant and not acting like you are entitled to extra service.\nIf the damage is as you describe, I doubt you'll have any difficulties. In general, it is my experience that Apple tries to err on the side of the consumer. If the damage is worse than you describe and the repair tech feels that it in some way responsible for the overheating, then service may be refused. If that happens and you feel this is unfair, escalate to the store manager and Apple Customer Relations as you feel appropriate. You can reach Customer Relations through just about any Apple support line by asking for that department by name.\nIn all likelihood, you're making a mountain out of a mole hill. Take the phone in and have an Apple tech have a look. You'll most likely be pleasantly surprised.\nSee also, Gigaom: Apple Tech Support Tips: 4 Steps to Bend Apple to Your Will\n\nA: Short and simple, nope.\nI had an iPhone 5, dropped caseless multiple times which resulted with huge dents in the corners and buffs and scratches all along the chamfered edges.\nThen the phone's data communication antennas died. I took the phone into the apple store and they replaced my phone with a brand new one.\nSo from experience, they don't deny service if there are scratches (or in my case huge dints in the corners) if your device has encountered a major fault/failure for an issue that is covered by warranty.\n\nA: They did for us, a small nearly invisible scratch on back our Iphone 7 and they said is not under guarantee any more because is damaged. The probem because they refuse it's because the mother board is dead and it's expensive for them to fix it.\n", "Q: How to define Lion’s key variations in a `.keylayout` file? In Lion you can hold down a key to show its variations.\n\nHowever, when using my custom keyboard layout in .keylayout format, this functionality is disabled.\nI assume Lion’s default keyboard layouts have the special characters that appear when you hold down a certain key hardcoded somewhere, and my old custom keyboard layout (based on the default Snow Leopard-layouts) lacks that data.\nMy question is: how can these “key variations” be defined in a .keylayout file?\n\nA: The special characters included in the popovers are defined in files like /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en_US.plist, not in .keylayout files. (The popovers are also used with languages that have their own input methods like Vietnamese.)\nI don't know how to add a property list like that for a custom layout though. I also tried copying the U.S..keylayout that comes with Ukelele to ~/Libary/Keyboard Layouts/ (without changing the name or id), but the popovers didn't work with it.\n\nA: Ukelele.app 2.2 now supports this, kind of:\n\nBy saving a keyboard layout in a bundle, it will become compatible with the “press and hold” mechanism for entering diacritics, introduced in OS X 10.7 (Lion). For this purpose, an “intended language” can be supplied (default is the system language), which will determine which possibilities are offered in the pop-up. However, such bundles may not work with OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and earlier.\n\n\nA: As far as I know the .keylayout file is not involved with this feature, it is somewhere else in the system.\nMany people have also asked how the character picker can be customized, but to date nobody has figured out how to do that either.\n\nA: The new version of English/Russian Typographical keyboard layout by Ilya Birman (v. 3.0) supports Press and Hold for entering key variations even though it’s a custom keyboard. I’ve managed to replace his layout from the bundle with mine, but these functionality worked only if layout name set in Ukelele was kept the same.\nNow I have my own custom layout with my own icon and Press and Hold support, but it’s name is “English — Ilya Birman Typography” and yet I can’t do anything about it. Can anybody think of an workaround for these?\nYou can download Birman’s layout from here (install script) — http://ilyabirman.ru/projects/typography-layout/ (click on “Скачать раскладку для Мака”)\nor here — http://cl.ly/HrDP though I’m not sure the second option will have Press and Hold support without running install script first.\n", "Q: Can 'Find My Mac' work while the computer is sleeping? Is the 'Find My Mac' feature of iCloud supposed to work while the computer is sleeping? I use this feature to check on things every once in a while, as well as show the feature off to other people. Every time I show them though, it always lists the machine as being offline. \nI ask too because a 'sleeping' mac does actually wake up every once in a while (in a very low level state), to basically check and update its mDNS/Bonjour config, as well as a few other minor things (I know specifically my iMac does this, I haven't looked on my MBA). I figured that if it was waking to at least check this stuff, it would also propagate to Find My Mac.\nFinal Update: So after switching around more network configs (and going just wifi), it actually worked worse - I couldn't wake the machine locally either (and this is with wake on network access checked). So I think its either something odd with my setup, or actual machine (I know already wifi is odd on it - I tried a defaults command to enable airdrop, and that didn't work either). My actual issue is due to the machine not being able to wake from sleep.\nNew Update: So, noticed a few things. Wifi was on, but not connected (nor should it be). I turned it off, and disabled the interface, and it still doesn't wake the computer up on the Ethernet adapter. I just now tested the opposite way, and it actually looked like it worked! Want to try again a bit later to make sure.\nUpdate: I re-enabled Find My Mac, and verified that wake on LAN was active. While it did work earlier on, once the computer actually went to sleep (about an hour later), it never seemed to want to update, until I woke the machine. Is Find My Mac supposed to wake it anyways? Or would Find My Mac while sleeping never actually show its current location until the next wake? As a precaution, I restarted my Mac and Airport Extreme just recently. Also, could this be a port forwarding issue on my FiOS router?\n\nA: If the Mac is sleeping there is no way for iCloud to locate it and it appears offline. \nHowever, as you noted, you can enable Wake for network access in energy preferences for it to periodically wake and check the network allow remote wake up using and AirPort.\nWhen the Mac connects to iCloud next time, your commands (locate, lock, wipe, message/alert) are sent to it.\n\n\nA: Yes it both can and is supposed to work while your mac sleeps, but it's far from perfect in several instances.\n\nApple has designed the hardware and software to let this specific and many other sorts of network accesses succeed even when a mac is sleeping to save energy.\nThis system relies on your Airport base station to proxy the incoming requests and wake up the mac when it detects and inbound request to locate, screen share, print to a shared printer or otherwise connect to the mac. Your AirPort doesn't sleep and is there to poke the mac and wake it up.\nThe two best articles to read up on this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bonjour Sleep Proxy\n\n*Mac OS X v10.6: About Wake on Demand\nIn a nutshell, the mac will warn you if you have not set up the hardware to allow the router to wake it up on demand. This is also called \"wake on lan\" WOL and uses the concept of a \"magic packet\" that is broadcast to identify the specific machine that is being requested to wake up. Once the mac is set to actually listen for a wake up signal, then it communicates to the router about all of the services that it should be woken up for. This means the mac will wake from spell periodically to check in with the router to re-register as needing to be awoken.\nAs you can see - there are several components, so this isn't 100% perfectly reliable - if the router reboots while the mac is asleep, you will be unable to wake the mac up until it reaches its next timed interval to wake up and reregister. Also, problem networks and/or hardware can cause this to be less reliable, but I have been very happy with this for the past three years in several sites where I have this turned on.\nNow - for the stolen mac situation, this is less useful than Find My Mac on an iOS device. First, the Wake on Demand does not succeed when a portable mac is not plugged in to power or an external display when the lid is shut. Second, the mac could be outside of WiFi access and unreachable. Third, the router where your mac might be sleeping (at a coffee shop for example) might not be an AirPort device or have the equivalent sleep proxy service enabled or even present. In those cases, your mac can not be located while sleeping. Until a data connection is added to a sleeping mac - the iOS devices will be far ahead in locating due to their near constant connection with the network when they are not powered off.\n\nAnd at long last, many of my macs lost their registration some time between enabling this in Lion and upgrading to 10.7.3. I think the change to the Recovery HD might have caused the service to be looking for the old image and I am now in the practice of testing this monthly for important macs and just deleting and re-creating the Find My Mac registration after each software update that changes the core OS. Not knowing why they drop off, I'm trying to compensate and keep the system working by extra manual labor.\n\nA: The problem is that that your iMac is not waking from sleep.\nSeveral people have been affected by this and discussed this on discussions.apple.com in these two threads. Both threads have been opened recently and deal with the \"Wake on network access\" problem in Lion.\nIt's required for your Mac to wake up because it needs to build up a Wi-Fi connection. Your iMac disconnects from the Wi-Fi in sleep mode. But without a connection to a known Wi-Fi network, Find my Mac cannot locate your computer.\nThis is what the iCloud troubleshooting guide says:\n\nFind My Mac can only locate your Mac if it is connected to an internet via a known Wi-Fi network. If your Mac is connected to the internet only by an ethernet cable, Find My Mac will not be able to locate your Mac.\n\nIdea\nDoes your iMac support wake on Airport network access? Newer Macs can wake up on both Airport and Ethernet access. This is then called \"wake on network access\" instead of \"wake on ethernet/airport access\".\nIf you iMac supports waking on Airport access, disable your Ethernet port. Maybe this will force the iMac to stay connected to the Wi-Fi during sleep and the 'bug' will not occur then.\n\n\nA: Yes - In the image below it has found mine, even though it is sleeping and has been for the last 12 hours. (sorry planet) Although I caught the screen shot when it was updating the location, but the green dot shows that it was found on both the iPhone app and the iCloud.com web app.\n\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. For me, what was wrong was that Find my Mac (and Back to my Mac) were not working reliably with Lion's low power wake. I disabled low power wake (that is, it now wakes on LAN to full power mode) by adding \"darkwake=0\" under the Kernel Flags key in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>Kernel</key>\n        <string>mach_kernel</string>\n        <key>Kernel Flags</key>\n        <string>darkwake=0</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: send to your iMac signal from \"find my iphone\". After that it will work properly. Sounds strange but it worked for me.\n", "Q: Retrieve Voice Memos from device? iOS seems to refuse to allow me to email \"long\" voice memos, and I'm unaware of any way to extract them from iTunes backups of my phone. How can I retrieve entire voice memos that aren't really short?\n\nA: There is a free third-party utility that I find very useful in situations like this. Macroplant iExplorer, for Mac and Windows, lets you mount the file system of your iOS device in the Finder or Windows Explorer, so you can copy the voice memo files (and most other iOS document files) directly to your computer without using iTunes. Macroplant also provides other paid apps with additional functionality.\n\nA: You can extract the voice memos from your iPhone back up by downloading this free application: http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=4974\nThis will allow you to read the files from your back up files. (saved my life)\nThe site also walks you through how to use it - it's really simple.\nOnce you have extracted the IOS files, go to the media folder and you will find recordings. That's where your voice memos will be!\n\nA: There is an unclear aspect of iTunes which isn't mentioned in the other answers here.\nAfter selecting the iPhone, iTunes (12.1.2.27) shows an On My Device > Voice Memos list in the sidebar.  However, this list doesn't actually seem to show all the voice memos on the device(!).\nIn particular, newly recorded memos don't seem to show for me, although they do in the PhoneView app.  Perhaps memos only appear in that list after the device has been synced.\nSo: don't try and use the On My Device > Voice Memos list to retrieve memos from the device.  Use the solutions mentioned in the other answers here instead.\n\nA: This answer by jmlumpkin is canonically correct, all existing memos sync over to a special \"Voice Memos\" playlist in iTunes. However, if you like to record voice memos that you will retrieve later on your computer, my suggestion would be to check out DropVox. Instead of having to go through iTunes, DropVox uploads your recordings to your DropBox folder as soon as you finish recording, which for me is far more convenient than syncing and dealing with iTunes. Personally, I have completely dropped Voice Memos and now completely use DropVox for everything.\n \nAnother avenue to avoid iTunes but still use the Voice Memo app is to use a software package like PhoneView to grab your existing memos directly from the device.\n\nA: If you look in the iPhone user manual - in the section on Voice Memos (Chapter 28, page 105) - it walks you through the intended process for syncing with your computer.\nhttp://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf\n\nSharing voice memos with your computer\nYou can sync voice memos with\nthe primary iTunes library on your computer, then listen to  memos on\nyour computer or sync them with another iPhone or iPod touch.\nWhen you\ndelete a synced memo from iTunes, it stays on the device where it was\nrecorded, but  is deleted from any other iPhone or iPod touch you\nsynced. If you delete a synced memo on  iPhone, it's copied back to\niPhone the next time you sync with iTunes, but you can’t sync that\ncopy back to iTunes a second time.\nSync voice memos with iTunes:\nConnect iPhone to your computer, then in iTunes select iPhone.  Select\nMusic at the top of the screen (between Apps and Movies), select Sync\nMusic, select  “Include voice memos,” and click Apply.\nVoice memos\nsynced from iPhone to your computer appear in the Music list and in\nthe Voice  Memos playlist in iTunes. Memos synced from your computer\nappear in the Voice Memos app on  iPhone, but not in the Music app\n\niTunes should actually sync Voice Memos if you have the option 'Sync Voice Memos' checked in the 'Music' tab when the iOS device is connected (either through USB or Wifi).\nI actually forgot I had this item checked in iTunes, and noticed I had a new playlist named 'Voice Memos' in iTunes. These were rather short (only a minute to 5 long I think), but synced ok.\nIf you delete a Voice Memo from the iTunes Library, it will not be deleted from the device on which it was recorded, as stated by the Manual, the next time that device is synced. In fact when you re-sync that device again, it is possible to have that Memo (which had been deleted from the iTunes Library on the computer) be copied back again into the iTunes Library on the computer, by checking the Include Voice Memos on the Device/Settings/Music page (as of iTunes 12.11.0.26).\nAdditionally, if the iTunes Library on the computer is empty at the time you connect a device on which some memos have been recorded, these memos will not be erased on the device when you sync; on the contrary, they will be copied back to the iTunes Library on the computer, no matter if Include Voice Memos is checked or not on the Device/Settings/Music page. Do not be deterred by the warning message in iTunes :\n\nThis iTunes library is empty. If you link the iPhone [device name] to\nthis library, all songs on the iPhone will be erased. Are you sure you\nwant to continue?\n\nas this will not apply to the Voice Memos which were recorded on the device (as of iTunes 12.11.0.26).\n\nA: First, you don't need to download any software. \nVisit this article, which explains how to transfer the memo to iTunes.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Dock your iPhone via USB\n  \n*Click the name of your iPhone under Devices in the left column\n  \n*Click the Music tab\n  \n*Click the checkbox for Include voice memos\n  \n*Sync your device\n  \n*Your files will appear under a new Voice Memos playlist\n  \n\nThen, if you want to have it play on Apple Tv or hear it from your phone and it still doesn't work, there is another trick.\nGo into iTunes, hold the Ctrl button and click on the song/memo you've imported. Choose the \"Create an AAC Version\" option. It will make a copy of the song above or below the original in iTunes. Then you can play this on Apple TV or off your phone like a regular song.\n", "Q: Can't login after updating software MacOS asked me for update to EFI 2.7, I said ok.

But I would like to be able to transition that pie-chart to new numbers and it grows or shrinks the appropriate parts automagically.\nClarification: I would like to animate between these two pie-charts:\n\n\nA: I also wanted this effect , and am getting close to what I want by setting the first slide transition to 'Magic Move' with zero delay and Start Transition on 'Automatically', and then duplicating the first slide about 25 times, and incrementing each segment data value on each slide to get close to 'smooth clock winding' action on 'Play'\n\nA: Here's one approach that's fairly quick and easy:\nCreate a Pie chart and input its values with the Chart Data Editor.\n\nWith the chart object selected, open the Slide Inspector and set the transition for Magic Move\n \nWith the chart still selected, copy the chart object using the menu or ⌘ + c\nCreate a new slide following your original and paste the chart object onto it.\nUse the Chart Data Editor to change the values for your pie slices to reflect the new figures. \nThe chart will now morph from old to new when you advance the slides.\n", "Q: How to remove or disable a default keyboard layout? Is it possible to remove or disable one of OS X Lion’s default keyboard layouts?\nI’m using a custom keyboard layout, and now that I managed to set it as the system-wide default keyboard layout, I’d like to be able to uncheck or remove the built-in “U.S.” keyboard layout that came with OS X. Here’s a screenshot — note that the checkbox is disabled:\n\nIn OS X 10.9, this preference pane has been redesigned, but still there’s no way to “remove” the built-in “U.S.” keyboard layout:\n\nSince I never use the U.S. keyboard layout, I’d love to get rid of it, i.e. remove it from the Input menu in the menu bar. How can I do this?\n\nUpdate: Daniel’s answer doesn’t really answer this question, but it does offer some valuable information regarding this problem:\n\nMac OS X seems to require at least one keyboard layout that the system recognizes as a “Latin character” layout to be selected.\n\nAssuming this is accurate information (thanks, Daniel!), the question could be rephrased as follows:\n\nHow to make OS X consider a custom keyboard to be a Latin character layout?\n\n\nUpdate: I just came across something that might help.\n\nA: It appears that you cannot do what you want to without some yet-undiscovered hack to the system. Mac OS X seems to require at least one keyboard layout that the system recognizes as a \"Latin character\" layout to be selected. This prevents your from being unable to enter your password at the login screen, etc. If you selected French, or Canadian, or another keyboard layout that the system recognizes as Latin characters, you can deselect the US layout.\nYour problem is that your custom layout, while containing Latin characters, is not recognized by the system as a Latin keyboard layout, and thus cannot be the only selected keyboard layout. See this question (sadly lacking a great answer) for more information.\nNote that a great answer to this question would answer your question also. Alas, my answer here only clarifies what the problem is, but I have no step-by-step solution for you. While such a hack may be possible, I see no evidence that anyone has figured out how to convince Mac OS X that a particular custom keyboard is safe to use as the sole selectable keyboard.\n\nA: For the sake of completeness, I filed this as bug ID #11137961 with Apple, and this is the response I got:\n\nBug ID #: 11137961\nBug Title: Allow disabling default (built-in) keyboard layouts when using a custom one\n\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based\n  on the following information:\nIf the issue is just getting your keyboard layout recognized as\n  ASCII-capable, the easiest would be to \"bundle\" your .keylayout, then\n  your Info.plist can contain a \"KLInfo_\" dictionary that\n  further describes it, like:\n <key>TISIntendedLanguage</key>\n <string>en</string>   # BCP 47 language string\n\nI'd need to look into this a bit more, but it looks like TIS will scan\n  the keyboard layout output to produce a USet and produce an initial\n  idea of ascii-ness by whether it passes the following minimal test:\n uset_containsRange(uSet, 0x0020, 0x0021) && uset_containsRange(uSet, 0x002C, 0x0039) &&\n uset_containsRange(uSet, 0x003F, 0x005A) && uset_containsRange(uSet, 0x0061, 0x007A);\n\nTIS will also examine the exemplar set for the above indicated locale and require a good dozen or so characters in the range [a-z].\nFor some suggestions on bundling a .keylayout, also see\n  TextInputSources.h.\nIf this is still an issue, or you have questions regarding the\n  resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with that\n  information.\nWe are now closing this bug report.\n\n\nA: For macOS 10.8 and later:\n\n*\n\n*Change the current input source to your custom keyboard layout.\n\n*Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist (in 10.9) or ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist (in 10.8 and earlier). You can convert the plist to XML with plutil -convert xml1.\n\n*Remove the input source or input sources you want to disable from the AppleEnabledInputSources dictionary. If there is an AppleDefaultAsciiInputSource key, remove it.\n\n*Restart.\n\nFor macOS 10.7 and earlier:\n\n*\n\n*Enable an input source that is not like your physical keyboard layout from System Preferences (I used Afghan Dari).\n\n*Run f=~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox*.plist; plutil -convert xml1 $f; open $f -e.\n\n*Remove other input sources except the temporarily enabled keyboard layout and your custom keyboard layout.\n\n*Log out and back in.\n\n*Remove the temporarily enabled keyboard layout from the property list.\n\n*Log out and back in.\n\n\n\nA: Here's another idea:  A few years ago the bundle(s) for Apple Keyboard Layouts were much easier to edit, and this problem seems to have been solvable:\nhttp://hintsforums.macworld.com/archive/index.php/t-71629.html\nPerhaps one could still use the old editable bundle, if you could get one from an old system, in the current OS.\n\nA: I just came across something that might help. Here goes:\n$ defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist \n{\n    AppleCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSourceID = \"com.apple.keylayout.Dutch\";\n    AppleDefaultAsciiInputSource =     {\n        InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n        \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 1337;\n        \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = QWERTY;\n    };\n    AppleEnabledInputSources =     (\n                {\n            InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n            \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 26;\n            \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = Dutch;\n        }\n    );\n    AppleInputSourceHistory =     (\n                {\n            InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n            \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 26;\n            \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = Dutch;\n        }\n    );\n    AppleSelectedInputSources =     (\n                {\n            InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n            \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 26;\n            \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = Dutch;\n        }\n    );\n}\n\nThis is on my system, where my custom keyboard layout (named “QWERTY”) is the default. Note that the KeyboardLayout Name and KeyboardLayout ID properties refer to the ID and name at the start of the .keylayout file.\nAs you can see, defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist AppleCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSourceID still returns the string \"com.apple.keylayout.Dutch\". Is there a list somewhere of the available com.apple.keylayout values? Is it possible to get such a value for a custom keyboard layout? ’Cause in that case, we could simply override the property.\nAlso, the AppleEnabledInputSources, AppleInputSourceHistory, and AppleSelectedInputSources properties all seem to ignore the custom keyboard layout, as their values correspond to the native OS X keyboard layout I originally selected when running Setup Assistant.\n\nAnother update: Aha! Seems like there’s another plist file from which we might be able to copy the settings.\n$ defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist \n{\n    AppleCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSourceID = \"org.unknown.keylayout.QWERTY\";\n    AppleDateResID =     {\n        smRoman = 2;\n    };\n    AppleEnabledInputSources =     (\n                {\n            InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n            \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 26;\n            \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = Dutch;\n        },\n                {\n            InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n            \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 1337;\n            \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = QWERTY;\n        },\n                {\n            \"Bundle ID\" = \"com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM\";\n            InputSourceKind = \"Non Keyboard Input Method\";\n        },\n                {\n            \"Bundle ID\" = \"com.apple.KeyboardViewer\";\n            InputSourceKind = \"Non Keyboard Input Method\";\n        },\n                {\n            \"Bundle ID\" = \"com.apple.inputmethod.ironwood\";\n            InputSourceKind = \"Non Keyboard Input Method\";\n        }\n    );\n    AppleGlobalTextInputProperties =     {\n        TextInputGlobalPropertyPerContextInput = 0;\n    };\n    AppleInputSourceHistory =     (\n                {\n            InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n            \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 1337;\n            \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = QWERTY;\n        },\n                {\n            InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n            \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 26;\n            \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = Dutch;\n        }\n    );\n    AppleNumberResID =     {\n        smRoman = 2;\n    };\n    AppleSelectedInputSources =     (\n                {\n            InputSourceKind = \"Keyboard Layout\";\n            \"KeyboardLayout ID\" = 1337;\n            \"KeyboardLayout Name\" = QWERTY;\n        },\n                {\n            \"Bundle ID\" = \"com.apple.inputmethod.ironwood\";\n            InputSourceKind = \"Non Keyboard Input Method\";\n        }\n    );\n    AppleTimeResID =     {\n        smRoman = 2;\n    };\n}\n\nAs you can see (AppleCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSourceID), apparently custom keyboard layouts get values like \"org.unknown.keylayout.FOO\" where FOO is the name of the keyboard layout (as specified in the .keylayout file).\nSo, to let’s try setting all values to our custom keyboard layout, named QWERTY and with ID 1337 (specified in the .keylayout file):\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist AppleCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSourceID -string \"org.unknown.keylayout.QWERTY\"\n\nSadly, this doesn’t seem to work.\nUpdate: @Lri discovered a reliable method — see his answer.\n\nA: Apple’s response to my bug report, in which I was asking to make it possible to remove the system default keyboard layout if another one is selected through System Preferences:\n\nEngineering has determined that this is not an issue for Apple to\n  address.\nAssuming this custom keyboard layout is bundled (.keylayout is inside\n  a bundle like foo.bundle/Contents/Resources/foo.keylayout), then this\n  could be as easy as inserting into the Info.plist's KLInfo_\n  dictionary:\n<key>KLInfo_Qwerty</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>TISInputSourceID</key>\n  <string>com.imgur.stack.keyboardlayout.Qwerty</string>\n  <key>TISIntendedLanguage</key>  \n  <string>en</string> \n</dict>\n\nIf this layout is needed system-wide (i.e. including password input)\n  it could be installed in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/, rather than the\n  same location in ~/Library/.\nPlease update your bug report to let us know whether this is still an\n  issue for you.\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please\n  update your bug report with them.\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple products for any updates\n  that might affect this issue.  Again, thank you for taking the time to\n  submit bugs.  We sincerely appreciate your input.\n\n\nA: I have just had success removing the default layout on High Sierra using the following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to your Library/Preferences folder.\n\n*Open the file com.apple.HIToolbox.plist file, either by double-clicking it or by using open on the command line. This will make XCode pop up and it may want to install additional components.\n\n*Repeat step 2 until XCode is finally showing the file’s structure.\n\n*Locate the AppleEnabledInputSources node and unfold it.\n\n*Remove the entry for the layout you want to remove.\n\n*Save the file and quit XCode.\n\n\nNow you probably need to log out or reboot to make this final. I had to reboot anyway for some update so that did the trick for me. Now I’m happily typing along in Neo at an agonizing glacially speed but not a single QWERTZ is in sight!\n\nA: After moving my custom keyboard layout to /Library/Keyboard Layouts instead of ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts I could suddenly remove the US layout.\nThis also fixed the issue I was having where the keyboard layout would switch back to the US layout whenever I activated apps such as Mail or the App Store.\nSupposedly this is because if the layout is installed as the current user instead of system wide then system apps can not use it, which would explain why it's not possible to remove the US layout from Preferences.\n\nA: Here is an idea:  After making sure the keyboard id of your custom layout is set to Roman, make a custom AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle which contains only that layout and substitute this for the one that comes with the OS. (I don't know myself what is involved in creating a .bundle)\n\nA: You can use Ukelele to mark your used layout as one that uses Latin script. Export as a bundle, install and then you will be able to delete the US one.\n\nA: It can be done easily.\nFirst change to your custom layout (use menu bar Input menu), then deselect the U.S. layout.\n", "Q: OSX Lion Spaces & desktop files When I switch between spaces, after the transition effect the files on the previous desktop fade back in, so that the same files are on every desktop.\nIs it possible to keep separate files on separate Spaces desktops?\n\nA: It's not; there is only one \"Desktop\" folder in your home directory, and the contents of that folder determine what appears on all of your desktops.\nOne problem with allowing varying sets of files for various desktops wouldn't that it's not clear what should happen if you delete a secondary desktop. Where would the files on that desktop go? Lion has made it relatively painless to add and remove desktops, so it's a user experience question that would have to be addressed.\nThat said, in theory someone could probably write an app that would let you do this. I believe the system sends out notifications when the active desktop changes, so you could probably write an app that watched for those changes and then swapped out the contents of the ~/Desktop/ folder for you. But as far as I'm aware, nobody has written that app yet.\n", "Q: Restoring one system file from Time Machine backup I have this file that I want to restore, that is a system file, normally stored on /tmp.\nIf I open Finder, and select GO > GO TO FOLDER\nI type /tmp on the window and it opens /private/tmp  (???? why ?)\nAnyway, the file is not there, but the file was there 5 days ago.

I right click on a file and select RESTORE TO, but nothing happens...\nHow do I select a system file from days ago from a time machine backup?\nYes, I am sure the file is there.\nthanks.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you're not going to be able to recover that file using Time Machine. There are a number of files and directories that Time Machine does not back up—primarily cache and temporary files. This includes the files in the /tmp directory. The directory itself (minus contents) is backed up, because it is necessary for a reinstall.\nThe complete list of exclusions can be found in /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist\n\nᔥ Devin Lane: Time Machine Exclusions\n\nA: because /tmp is a symbolic link to /private/tmp\naka /tmp does not really exist\n\n", "Q: How to search more magazines in Apple Newsstand on iPod? When I open Newsstand on Apple iPod, I don't find any magazines other than the featured ones, is it possible to find more magazines using the Store part of Newsstand?\n\nA: No - You have to click on Search and a serach queery will bring up all results accross iTunes.\nThe store page behind newsstand is just a coverpage for the iTunes store. You will find that once you have entereed the store from newsstand you are able to browse and download any iTunes content.\nIt is easier in this case to use iTunes on the desktop of a computer.\nYou can browse in alternate ways by tapping on release date and then sorting by name, most popular or release date.\nHowever when you use the iTunes store on an iPad, you have the additional option of filtering results by Category, you can then select Newsstand.\n", "Q: Enable mirroring on iPhone 4 (over-the-air) Through a cydia tweak or otherwise, is it possible to enable over-the-air mirroring for unsupported-by-default devices, i.e. iPhone 4, iPad 1 et al.?\nYou would think it's a popular question but all google results result in a dead end. The closest I've come to finding an answer is this topic, where an user claims to have come up with a solution, but then dies*.\nConsidering people managed to even port Siri for the iPhone 4, I'm sure someone must have made a successful attempt at enabling mirroring, which I guess only involves flipping a switch, i.e. no authorization checks, proxies, and missing binary files here.

However, this should be similar. I've stumbled upon it in Cydia a few times, but never bothered to try it, because AirPlay just never appealed to me. It's not explicitly AirPlay Mirroring, but it does the same thing. There's also a package called Display Mirroring and DisplayOut found in Cydia, and they enable mirroring, but it's not over-the-air (you have to use a VGA adapter).

There are many places where the \"linen\" texture is used in Lion, from the Login Window to various app backgrounds like Safari and so on.\nIs it possible to replace this image with something else?  Let's say I have a nice hessian weave pattern from a lovely house I lived in that hasn't been decorated since 1979, or some sand, or a patchwork quilt depicting the transperambulation of pseudo cosmic anti matter?\nWhatever I wish to change it to, a) can I change it, and b) will it change it for all instances where the linen appears, or does each application have it's own resources which would need ammending one by one with differing methods, and c) is there a particular size/fileformat/other feature that any replacement image must have, for example must it be a 200x200 PNG that tesselates etc.\n\nA: You can change the linen of the login background, but I've not seen this change affect other places (e.g. reading list in safari).\nThere is a tool, which combines various GUI tweaking options in an app. It's called...\nLion Designer\n\n*\n\n*customize backgrounds for Login Screen, Mission Control, Dashboard, Launchpad\n\n*customize folder backgrounds in Launchpad\n\n*get the colorful finder sidebar (like in previous version of OSX), requires SIMBL\n\n*reset settings\n\n\nA: Removing linen in Safari\nSafari uses two different sources of linen, one for scrolling past the edge of the page or resizing the page in full-screen mode, and one for use behind the Reading List. To replace the Reading List linen, gentmatt has identified the file you need to replace. Replacing the linen you see when you scroll past the edge of the page, however, is slightly trickier.\n\nHere's how to change it:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need administrator access to make these changes. Login with an administrator account.\n\n*Download SArtFileTool and unzip. Note: I did not create this tool, and it is a compiled executable, so use at your own risk\n\n*Open the Terminal, and cd to the folder you unzipped.\n\n*Run sudo cp /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Resources/SArtFile.bin .. This copies your existing SArtFile.bin so we can work with it.\n\n*Run ./SArtFileTool -d SArtFile.bin sartfiles.\n\n*This creates a directory in the folder with system artwork called \"sartfiles\". Open it.\n\n*Inside, find 226.png and 226@2x.png. These are the linen textures Safari uses.\n\n*Make whatever changes you wish, so long as the files remain the same dimensions. When you're done, save over or replace the existing 226.png and 226@2x.png files.\n\n*Run ./SArtFileTool -e sartfiles SArtFile.bin SArtFile.new.bin.

It’s lighter and more subtle, and it can be\n  appreciated when navigating between webpages with the new gestures.\n\n\nSo it seems that for Safari and Reading List the image is probably a part of the Safari Application Bundle, which I will now start to investigate more thoroughly.\n", "Q: What is VPN on demand, and how do I get it to work with iOS? I know what a VPN is, and I've done a little reading about how to set up VPN on demand. However, I'm confused. \nIs VPN on demand essentially a certificate instead of a password prompt on each connect? Do apps need to take care of this specifically, or does iOS handle it whenever it sees that an app wants VPN on demand? What is VPN on demand?\n\nA: EDIT: This answer is outdated. Here are some newer links that may help you if you are trying to set up VPN On Demand:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/apple-configurator\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mdm/vpn-overview-mdm2d2adb35d/1/web/1\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/vpn\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/personal_vpn/vpn_on_demand_rules\n\nYes, it does involve authentication by certificate. From this article from Apple:\n\niOS supports VPN On Demand for networks that use certificated-based authentication. You specify which domains require a VPN connection by using a configuration profile.\n\nThe VPN connection is made whenever the device tries to connect to certain domains. Specific apps don't need to do anything; as soon as they try to access such a server the VPN connection is initiated.\nVisit this support page for information about how to use the Configuration Utility to create a configuration profile that sets up VPN On Demand.\n", "Q: Make RSS screensaver show more articles? I have an RSS screensaver, but at the moment it only displays a few articles and then loops. Is there a way to make it display more articles?\n\nA: Sure — the easiest way to do this is to edit the screensaver's Quartz composition file. It's located at\n/System/Library/Screen Savers/RSS Visualizer.qtz\n\nIn order to edit this, you'll need Quartz Composer, which you may already have (if you installed an old version of the developer tools), or you can download it with the Graphics Tools package here.\nOpen the aforementioned file, click on the \"RSS\" macro patch, and change the News Count to your liking:\n\nThen save the file or make a copy and put it in ~/Library/Screen Savers.\n\nEdit: I just spent a while trying to figure out if you can expose this option via the options panel, but it seems there's some very specific interface in place for the RSS Visualizer screensaver (see /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/.Quartz Composer.saver/Contents/Resources), so you can't do it if you also want to see the normal RSS options.\n\nA: This might depend on the RSS feed. If the RSS feed only contains 5 entries, there’s no easy way for you to display more entries in the screensaver.\nIf that’s the case (your question didn’t specify which feed you’re talking about, so there’s no way for me to check), you could create your own RSS feed based on the website’s HTML, rather than use the one the website is offering. That way, you could have more entries in the feed. This can be done using FeedWeaver, a free online web app.\n", "Q: Prevent iMac from sleeping, for VPN login? We have an iMac in the office, and I have been getting inconsistent access when trying to log in to it. The firewall isn't going down, since I can connect to the VPN. After discussing it with the people at the office, we suspect that the iMac is going to sleep. \nIs it possible to keep the iMac \"awake\" 24 hours a day? How do I instruct the people at the office to configure the iMac? What settings should be changed? The iMac is running OS X Lion 10.7.3. \n\nA: You can disable sleeping in the Energy Saver preference pane of System Preferences.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use a free app called Caffeine to easily prevent your Mac from sleeping just with a click of the mouse.  Both work exactly the same, but Caffeine makes it easier to dynamically switch between the two settings.\n\nA: There are two main things that would make connecting to the iMac difficult over VPN, the machine going to sleep being one and being assigned a different IP address over DHCP being the other.\nThe settings for sleep are stored in the Energy Saver preference pane in System Preferences.\n\nThere is a slider for Computer Sleep, slide this to 'Never'. This will mean the machine will never sleep automatically. \n\nThere are options for waking over LAN too if you desperately need things to sleep.\n\n\nIf you still experience issues after this you may find that you need to configure a manual IP in the firewall and in the Network preference pane, again in System Preferences.\nI don't have a 10.7 system here for screenshots otherwise I'd add some. If someone edits with some or if I get home to grab some that would be ideal.\n\nA: If you need more control over when to or not to sleep, take a look at Wimoweh. It allows you to never sleep when: specific apps are running, system conditions such has high CPU usage, network connections, etc. $1 on the Mac App store\n", "Q: Where does the Mac store account pictures? I took a picture to add to my account on Mac. \nNow I want to use it on messenger, but I can't find it. On the account config, it's too small. I need to find the original. \nWhere are the accout pictures stored on a Mac?\n\nA: On Mac OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion, they exist as files that are a mix of jpegs and tiffs on my Mac. Thus, they can be copied to another location.\nThe full set of user photos are in two different locations. However, the user photo in question, does not necessarily correlate with the respective user folder. So it's a bit quirky.\nLook at:\nMacintosh HD/Users/user0/Library/Images/iChat Recent Pictures/\nBy 'user0' I refer to the name of the first-defined user on the system (see below context).\nIn this location are 3 user photos, for 3 of my 4 users.\n3 jpegs, all good quality.\nIntriguingly, it is for all users except for user0.\nThe jpegs are called the exact names as follows: 'Recent 1.jpg', 'Recent 2.jpg' and 'Recent 3.jpg'\nFor user0, this photo is in:\nMacintosh HD/Library/Caches/\nIt is a tiff, poor quality.\nThe tiff is called exactly 'com.apple.user501picturecache.tiff'\nImportantly, here is the system context to above:\n- An Apple iMac 20\" early 2009 which originally ran Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard\n- The first-defined user was user0. Nor the name, nor the photo, have been changed.\n- All other users followed shortly after. Again, nor the names nor, nor the photos, have been changed.\n- It has been updated with every new Mac OS X when released.\n- Currently running Mac OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion.\nNote:\nWhen I updated to Lion I recall that the user0 photo did not look so good at login. It looked poorer quality. So something happened there. I expect that Lion rearranged where the photos were and did something to the photos - I have no proof of this, it's just a hunch.\n\nA: That's the way to find it on OS X 10.8.3:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ImageKit.RecentPictureService/Data/Library/Images/Recent Pictures/\n\nA: I was having difficulty finding the account picture cache on Mountain Lion 10.8.3. They were not found in \n~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iChat/Pictures\n\nor\n~/Library/Images/iChat Recent Pictures/\n\nPresumably this is because iChat became Messages in Mountain LionSo I used the command line tool fs_usage to find them. By running the command\nsudo fs_usage -w | grep .tiff\n\nAnd then clicking and setting a new account picture you can see the path to the file that is written to disk when you change account pictures.\nTurns out that in mountain lion 10.8.3 the recent account pictures have moved to:\n   ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ImageKit.RecentPictureService/Data/Library/Images/Recent Pictures/\n\n\nA: Mac OS X 10.5+ stores user's account pictures within the Directory Service with the exception of an account that has not modified their user picture from when first created. When first created an account contains a 'Picture' attribute in their user record that is a path to the image in question. This can be read using the dscl command (dscl . -read /Users/${USER} Picture).\nIf a user has modified their user picture at any time the account picture (aka cropped version if appropriate), it is stored in the 'JPEGPhoto' attribute of their user record.\nOriginal files can be found at /Library/User Pictures if you're looking for an Apple provided picture, while your personal original files should be found at ~/Library/Images/iChat Recent Pictures/. If the files are ever removed from the iChat Recent Pictures folder, it will not affect your user account's image whatsoever.\nIf you wish to extract a version of your account picture you can do so by running the following command\ndscl . -read /Users/${USER} JPEGPhoto | tail -1 | xxd -r -p > ${HOME}/Desktop/accountImage.jpg\n\nThe resolution can vary, depending on the original size of the photo and what version of the operating system you're using when it is saved.\nIf you are running Mac OS X 10.4, my memory is failing me as I don't recall if the user picture was stored in NetInfo or not.\n\nA: I found the default pictures in /Library/User Pictures\nThere are six subdirectories under this directory. You can put your own set of pictures in as part of the default collection.\nCreate a new empty subdirectory with your name and since this is a directory outside your account and can be accessed by any user, you will have to enter your administrator password.\nThen copy and paste your pictures to this new subdirectory, again entering your admin password.\nYour own pictures should now show up in the default collection. Then you will have to go into the contacts app and change your photo. Then go into the Users and Groups under system preferences and change the photos. To change the photos select edit and then default and then scroll down. \n\nA: Take a look in ~/Library/Images/iChat/Recent Pictures. \n\nA: Running Snow Leopard 10.6.8\nI have found my captured picture for user login at the following location.  Both the original and the cropped were found in ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iChat/Pictures\n\nA: Building upon all the previous answers here is mine:\ndscl . -read ~$USER JPEGPhoto | xxd -p -r > $USER.jpg\n\nAlso here is something mostly original I have found:\nsudo plutil -convert xml1 -o - /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/$USER.plist |\n    vim '+/>j/+3,/>j//<\\/d/-1j | .!base64 -D > $USER.jpg' '+q!' -\n\nEven if it is way more complicated it can be useful, because plutil is also available on other platforms. It converts the binary plist with the user info to xml, then uses vim to select the part with the picture and finally decodes it from base64 into jpg. \n\nA: If you click on the icon in the \"Accounts\" preference page a context menu appears that offers \"Edit picture ...\" as the top-most option. This opens a dialog that - at least in my case - shows a larger version of my user icon. I guess for the specific purpose of creating a messenger icon it would be feasible to simply screen-shot this picture.\nAdmittedly, without having the technical background to answer the actual question I'm really not sure whether the actual user icons are stored in a regular file. If this file were located inside your user account (i.e. ˜/Library) the preference page would have to crawl deeply in your account for displaying the icon if another user merely opens the \"Account\" preference page. \nIf, OTOH, the file were be stored somewhere in /Library it would probably be difficult to set the icon individually for each user who doesn't have administrator rights. Someone else shed some light on this, please.\n", "Q: Mac Keyboard Doesn't Recognize iPhone via USB I have a new Mac Keyboard and I've successfully connected my mouse to it, however when I connect my iPhone nothing happens.  The iPhone doesn't go into a charge state and my MBP doesn't detect the iPhone.  I've tried three different cables with no difference.  Connecting directly to the MBP works fine.\nWhy would the keyboard support the mouse but not the iPhone?\n\nA: The Mac Keyboard is a non-powered USB hub. As such, it may or may not recognize your iPhone when attached to it.  Just in case though, have you tried connecting it to the port that your mouse currently is in? Do this just to make sure you don't have a bum keyboard.\n", "Q: Auto delete old Sent mail from IMAP sent folder on ipad/ipod Using an IMAP email account there is an option to delete \"Deleted Messages\" : \"Remove after one week\". I want to do the same with Sent Mail since I CC: all sent-mail to my inbox and it is stored on my main computer.\nBut I can't find a setting in iOS to auto delete Sent Mail after a certain time (but it exist on OSX).   Is it okay to set my \"Sent Mailbox\" to the same \"Trash\" folder as my \"Deleted Mailbox\" in the \"Mail Behaviors\"?  Will all mail then be deleted after a week?  Or what is the right way to handle this?\nSettings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars \nAccount > Advanced\nhttp://tutorials.bluehost.com/help_media/iphone_imap_advanced.jpg\n\nA: The mailboxes in iOS will, for the most part tend to themselves. The mailstore isn't permanent, and if the system needs more room, it will purge the local copies of older messages from the local store. The sent box will also sync with the Sent mailbox on the IMAP server, so if that mailbox is being purged, the messages will disappear from your local store.\nBottom line, unless you have a very specific reason to want those messages deleted right now, you don't need to worry about it. Your iPhone isn't going to \"fill up\" with sent messages.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s can't use office internet (Squid Proxy) I've configured iPhone 4s to use our office wifi and specified a squid proxy and its authentication data (tested and working on computers and my colleague android phone) but when I connect to office's wifi a \"Login\" completely white screen appears.\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: On the phone, go to advanced WiFi network settings and put the HTTP Proxy settings there.\nIt can happen quite often for the iOS to not be able to detect the proxy.\n\nA: You can apply a configuration profile containing the Wi-Fi details, including the proxy details.  This can be done with iPhone Configuration Utility, Apple Configurator or an MDM solution.\n", "Q: Can iTunes find all songs with no Album Art? I want to find all songs or tracks which don't have Album Art associated with them in my iTunes music library.  I want to do this so that I can fix Album Art problems in advance of a backup.  How can I have iTunes show me just these tracks?\nMy iTunes library is on a Windows 7 PC.\n\nA: With the new iTunes 11, the smart playlist has a new filter labelled \"Has Artwork\". Simply set that to false, and there's your songs without artwork!\n\nA: You can do this by creating a Smart Playlist:\n(I'm using a Mac, but it will be similar for you)\n\nSet the \"Album Artwork\" rule to \"false\":\n\nThis will update automatically as you add artwork to your albums. And you can simply delete this playlist when you're done.\n\nA: Sounded like a good answer but on my itunes on Macbook Air, this finds 439 songs with no artwork, yet many of them when I look at them in the playlist, I see album artwork.  Even odder, some of the songs in the same album, having the same artwork, make the list while others don't.\nI have used Doug Scripts to find songs with missing artwork\nhttp://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/scripts13.php\n\nA: If you want to get all the album artwork for your songs or albums I recommend you find a program that gets metadata for your songs. Like I use TuneUp on my mac and it gave all my albums with no artwork an artwork that is one of the ones for your album.\n", "Q: Keynote: appear, disappear, reappear in Build Order Is there a way to make an object in the Build order appear, disappear, then reappear on the same slide?\nFor example, I want to show a blank slide. Then, when I click, I'd like a circle to appear. When I click a second time, I'd like the circle to disappear. Finally, when I click a third time, I'd like the circle to appear again.\nObviously, this is a vastly simplified example of the problem. However, if you can tell me how to accomplish this, I can apply the solution to the very complex slide I'm building.\nAlso, I know I could do this by duplicating the slide and playing with what is visible on the second slide. However, I would like to accomplish this in a single slide.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not possible to do. (Provide Kenyote feedback to Apple if you'd like to see this feature added!) Here are two possible alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create 2 copies of the object on the slide and have them build in/out in sequence. This will keep your slide deck cleaner and make it easier to align the objects.\n(objects shown separately for illustrative purposes; you'd want to align them perfectly!)  \n\n\n*As you suggested, create 2 copies of the slide with no transition (so the effect is seamless and there's no delay). This will make it easier to see how you've set up the effect in your list of slides. (But if nothing else on the slide changes, it might just be annoyingly redundant.)\n\n\nA: Add Opacity action set to 0 with duration 0s. Then increase the opacity to 100 with duration 0s. And repeat setting start on click for each action. \n\n\nA: Duplicate the object, and have the duplicate version appear on the third click.\n\n", "Q: BF2 via CrossOver \"@\" problem I've installed BF2 with CrossOver, and so far it's working.\nNow I like to play online but I can't login with my e-mail because of the \"@\"\nDoes anyone know how to type the \"@\"?\nCan't find it...\nThanks\n\nA: It usually depends on your keyboard. It's ⇧ Shift+2 on US keyboards, and I suspect you might have to use that in Crossover as well.\nAlso keep in mind that Crossover has the ability to configure your modifier keys, so you might want to try some other modifiers with L if that's what you normally do.\n", "Q: How can I use text substitutions without having to type a space? I have some custom text substitutions set up in the Language & Text pane of System Preferences. But in order to activate a substitution, I have to type the shortcut and then press the spacebar. This results in the replacement text followed by a space character. So if I want the text to be at the end of a text field when I submit a form, for example, I have to type \"[shortcut]space⌫↩\" instead of just \"[shortcut]↩\".\nIs there any way to make the replacement instantaneous, so I don't have to insert and delete a space that I don't want?\n\nA: Related: Text expansion for Mac OS X Lion?\nTextExpander and DashExpander meet the requirement. \nIn TextExpander I have macros that are expanded without keying space, return or enter.\n\nA: The closest thing to doing what you’re after without using additional software, is to create a custom keyboard layout. You can map a single key or a key combination to any string you want.\nFor example, using my custom QWERTY layout, I can type ⌥ + O to get ಠ_ಠ (instead of ø, which I never used).\nIt’s not really “text replacement”, but it’s a solution nevertheless. Also, I found that keyboard shortcuts work much faster than text replacements, once you get used to them.\nAnother benefit of this solution is that it works in all applications, while text substitution only works in Cocoa apps.\n\nA: I don't have this issue, pressing the enter key also works instead of space.\nI created a custom Text Substitution in Language & Text, then opened TextEdit and it worked on any key press, not just space or enter.\n", "Q: Same shortcuts across input sources OS X by default supports emacs key bindings, for example Ctrl+A to go to the beginning of the line, My problem is when I switch to a different language these Ctrl key bindings stop working.\nIs it possible to either modify the keyboard layout to send English letters when the key is pressed with Ctrl. Or add new binding to OS X that accept the Ctrl binding with the correspoding letters in the other input source. Or is there a third choice?\n\nA: I tried modifying some non-Latin layouts that came with Ukelele, but couldn't get shortcuts like control+A to work with them. I haven't found a way to get them to work with my custom keyboard layout either, but I'm probably just missing something...\nAnother option would be to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"^ф\" = moveToBeginningOfParagraph:; // ctrl-a on the Russian layout\n    \"^щ\" = (insertNewlineIgnoringFieldEditor:, moveBackward:); // ctrl-o on the Russian layout\n    // ...\n}\n\nSome of the default control key actions, copied from lri.me/keybindings:\n\"^p\" = moveUp:;\n\"^n\" = moveDown:;\n\"^b\" = moveBackward:;\n\"^f\" = moveForward:;\n\"^h\" = deleteBackward:;\n\"^d\" = deleteForward:;\n\"^a\" = moveToBeginningOfParagraph:;\n\"^e\" = moveToEndOfParagraph:;\n\"^k\" = deleteToEndOfParagraph:;\n\"^l\" = centerSelectionInVisibleArea:;\n\"^v\" = pageDown:;\n\"^t\" = transpose:;\n\"^y\" = yank:;\n\"^o\" = (insertNewlineIgnoringFieldEditor:, moveBackward:);\n\"^P\" = moveUpAndModifySelection:;\n\"^N\" = moveDownAndModifySelection:;\n\"^B\" = moveBackwardAndModifySelection:;\n\"^F\" = moveForwardAndModifySelection:;\n\"^A\" = moveToBeginningOfParagraphAndModifySelection:;\n\"^E\" = moveToEndOfParagraphAndModifySelection:;\n\"^V\" = pageDownAndModifySelection:;\n\"~^b\" = moveWordBackward:;\n\"~^f\" = moveWordForward:;\n\"~^B\" = moveWordBackwardAndModifySelection:;\n\"~^F\" = moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:;\n\n", "Q: Adium + Office Communicator We are required to use Office Communicator at my work for instant messages.  I am currently using the multi-protocol client Adium for my other accounts (AIM, Gtalk).  I don't see a way to add an account for Office Communicator, so I'm wondering if there is any 3rd party support for this?\nAll of the searching I've been doing only points to running a separate application (which I already use), or to requests to add this feature to Adium.  I've haven't tracked down a 3rd party module, so I thought I would ask here if anyone knows of one.\n\nA: A SIPE plugin is under development.

It does work if I use the key combos directly from my laptop's keyboard, however. It's also not working in Messages, to go between conversations.\nMy Apple wired keyboard (full size with number pad) is plugged into my 30 inch Cinema display, but to be honest, it still doesn't work if I plug directly in to my laptop.\nAny ideas?\nUpdate: On both my internal laptop and wired keyboard, I've remapped the Caps Lock key to be the Control key, and vice versa. If I restore defaults, the tab cycling is fixed. If I set the Caps Lock key back to being the Control key, and try to cycle backwards, it breaks. Just confirmed the same is true in Safari. And, no matter how I modify the keys of the internal keyboard, cycling is perfect.\n\nA: If the Shift key works in normal context, and if the same combo doesn't work in say Safari, then I'd think the keyboard hardware has an issue, or the keyboard combination is mapped to another function in Keyboard Shortcuts.\nI mapped the combo to Show Launchpad and experienced the exact same issue.  Shift works, Ctrl + tab works, but because I mapped the combo elsewhere it was no longer available to apps to use, and Ctrl + Shift + tab failed in Chrome and Safari.\nIf that is not the case, then its remotely possible that the keyboard is faulty, but since I would expect other combinations to fail if it were faulty, you haven't mentioned any and I assume that none are.\n\nA: I just stumbled upon a shortcut that seems to work in both directions:\n\ncontrol + shift + command + left\ncontrol + shift + command + right\n\n", "Q: iTunes Download Previous Purchase Fails I'm running iTunes 10.6 on OS X Lion 10.7.3.\nI've tried multiple times to download this one song, and it keeps failing.

Any suggestions?\n\nA: Do you run any AntiVirus on your Mac?\nIntego NetBarrier seems to be the culprit for a lot of people with the same issue.\nThere are similar reports of error -100000 on Windows as well and many of them were resolved by disabling Firewall and AntiVirus.\n", "Q: Deleted email from iPad while offline gets a strikethrough line on web app rather than deleted When I delete an email message in Mail on my iPad, everything works normally—unless I'm offline. When this is the case, it deletes from the iPad, but the message on the web interface (in this case FastMail) retains it in the Inbox with a strikethrough line:\n\nIs this a problem with IMAP, Mail, or FastMail? How can I make Mail actually delete the message?\n\nA: The IMAP protocol has this silly concept of a message that has been marked as deleted but isn't really actually deleted.\nThe iPad only marks the mail as deleted. The IMAP client on the iPad considers this sufficient for the message to be gone, and you can't see it anymore when using that client. The web mail wants the message to be REALLY deleted before it goes away. If it's just marked deleted, it will still appear... with a strikethrough line.\nTo get the message to disappear from the web mail, you need to expunge deleted messages. The web mail interface might offer a way to do it directly, or else it will do it automatically when you delete any message from within the web mail interface. When messages are expunged, they are expunged all together, so it is enough to delete one single other message, and all of the other marked deleted (struck through) emails in the same folder will follow.\n", "Q: Can I block ports and network traffic when using Personal Hotspot? I would like to block ports and network traffic when using my jailbroken iOS device as a Personal Hotspot.\nThe reason is I don't want my backup program, computer updates, or any high bandwidth usage applications to be able to download or upload too much data.\nIs there a way to do that using iOS itself or an application?\n\nA: For outgoing connections, the only jailbreak application that exists is Firewall iP. It behaves similarly to the Mac OS X application Little Snitch.\nFor incoming connections, you will have to use a regular firewall system such as ipfw.\nDisclaimer: To anyone actually looking to use ipfw on iOS, you're going to have to patch the kernel to include support for pf. Documented, nobody has ever done it, but it's not technically impossible. The jailbreak itself patches the kernel upon boot, so this would require the same exploits used during that process. If you have happened to patch pf into the kernel, then proceed with my original answer below.\nAdd the http://theworm.altervista.org/cydia/ repository in Cydia > Manage > Sources > Edit > Add. Then install the MTerminal app from the BigBoss repository and the network-cmds package from The Worm repository. Then you can go into the terminal app you just got and run ipfw. This will let you write to your firewall tables. If you need a tutorial on how to use ipfw, there's a good one here.\n\nA: You could look into using the tweak Firewall iP (a paid package hosted by BigBoss repository) - it provides a number of options for controlling outgoing connections from your iPhone.\n", "Q: How do you access the content of the iPhoto bundle from Time Machine?

It looks like there is a dark spot on the bluetooth antenna which prevents it from picking signal from devices positioned in particular places next to the computer.\nMy bluetooth headset loses the connection (drops some sound) when I stand next to the computer with my head and body between the computer and the right ear cup.\nSo you should check if you don't have a similar dark spot next to your computer. Or if the disconnections are not happening (more often) in particular situations which could impact the signal.\nBatteries\nSome batteries will start having problems with the contact, when oxidation occurs all you have to do is turn quickly the batteries in the mouse to remove the oxidation... If it's not enough you can try scratching the parts which are touching the mouse's contacts and the mouse's contacts with something metallic to remove any traces of oxidation.\nAlso tapping the mouse on the desk will increase the chances of batteries moving and shifting position just so slightly that they might be touching the connectors with a dirtier part.\nMismatched rechargeable batteries seem to create problems. Using two batteries both from the same brand but with different recharge cycles seems to trigger disconnections of my Razer mouse.\nThis answer also has a good explanation about how the battery level is calculated. It also states that some \"cheap\" batteries will discharge differently and will not be able to properly power the mouse after a short period of time:\n\n...they can't supply the sudden bursts of power the radio in the mouse requires, so some transmissions are lost...\n\nOther\nOne other major problem you might experience is interferences. You will want to have a look at this list of sources.\n\nA: For the last few months, I've had the same problem with my magic mouse.  The only fix I've found is to remove the battery cover and leave it off.  I came across this advice from someone on another blog and it's worked for me.\n\nA: The first thing to do would be to try replacing the batteries — even if they may seem full, there's still a chance they could affect performance.\nIf that doesn't work, take a look around your workspace for possible sources of interference, such as cordless phones or microwaves. Apple has a knowledge base article listing many possible sources, and suggestions on how to avoid problems.\nFinally, if the problem is easily reproducible, perhaps you should take your computer and mouse in to the Apple Store to get their advice (and, if necessary, perhaps a replacement).\n(It would also be interesting to note — if you have any other bluetooth devices, do they experience the same connection problems that your Magic Mouse does?)\n\nA: Are you using rechargeable batteries or even the same brand all the time? I'm thinking there could be a battery-related problem, not necessarily bad batteries but just the interaction between the battery compartment of the Magic Mouse, which is distinctive, and the profile of the battery.\nThe Magic Mouse has some big cylindrical contacts at the negative end that are spring loaded and provide a good clamping force. At the other end are two recesses that house the positive terminals.\nIf the profile of the top of the battery is such that the button top is rounded or the sides slope down to the flat top (however slightly) rather than being perfectly parallel then perhaps the bang forces the the button against the edge of the contact surround, forcing the battery down and back, breaking the contact with the positive terminal. If you look at the positive contacts and observe any rounding to the plastic around the contacts that could be it.\nThe metal button on the positive end may be soldered, welded or just contact the electrode without any mechanical connection other than the sleeve of the battery and the clamping force of the contacts. If you can switch batteries and still see the connection issues with a bang on the desk then you've taken a step toward ruling out any individual set of batteries being faulty.\nIf it's neither of those things, head off to the Apple Genius Bar. Chances are they will just replace it.\n\nA: Make sure you aren't using cheap batteries.  Minimum is good rechargeable, or alkaline.  Best is name brand alkaline (Energizer or Duracell).  Cheap batteries or cheap rechargeable will not last long, and may result in the system believing they are full when they are actually close to empty.\n\nA: I had this problem, and the fix for me was to move to a 5 GHz Wi-Fi network.  The usual 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi networks interfere with the Bluetooth signal.  I used to have disconnections of my mouse every five minutes or so, which was somewhat annoying for a new computer.  But choosing the 5 GHz network on my home Wi-Fi seems to have fixed it.  I have had no disconnections for over 24 hours.\n\nA: Your iPhone might be obstructing the signal when you put it between the mouse and the mac.\n", "Q: If I'm using Gmail, can I clean out the space that \"Mail Messages\" are taking up on my hard drive? In looking to make some room on my MacBook Pro's Hard drive, I ran the excellent Disk Inventory X\nAs I expected, movies, my Aperture Archive and other media-intensive files took up a ton of my space. But I was surprised to find that files that Disk Inventory X categorized as \"Mail Message\" took up a whopping 22 GB.\nI mostly use Apple Mail as my email client, although I've been giving Sparrow another try lately.  But in either case, other than a legacy MobileMe account that I never use, Gmail is my mail provider (and storage facility). \nWhat the heck is stored locally in that size, and can I safely delete it somehow?\n(I can't fathom it matters, but I'm running Lion.)\n\nA: Mail is caching your Gmail contents and this is normal for IMAP. See this SuperUser question and answers for possible solutions and implications regarding SpotLight search through emails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable all message caching\n\n*Disable attachment caching\n\n\nA: I'm thinking it's probably messages, attachments, indexes, and logs. If you clean them out, you could just try using the online Gmail if it happens again. Otherwise, there's probably a setting for Mail that allows you to choose how many messages to store, and whether to download attachments. (I'm not at my Mac right now)\n", "Q: Is there a window tiling app that snaps to other windows' edges rather than predefined screen areas? All window tiling apps I've seen are designed to make windows snap to preset screen areas, such as \"the left half of the screen\" or even \"this size of rectangle specified with a grid.\" Is there one that would let me do, say, this:\n\n\nA: Take a look at this Wiki question, and see if any of the answers meet your needs.\nIn particular, this one looks interesting:\nZooom/2 - \"Magnetism. If you like snapping windows the the edges of the screen or other windows (as in many X window managers), you will love this.\"\n\n\nA: Cinch provides the snap to edges you are looking for, but I don't think it's good enough to do the total window arrangement you are looking for.\nSizeUp by the same provider as Cinch provides the ability to quadrant your screen, but these are more precise full quarter, rather than the different sized windows you have.\n\nA: BetterSnapTool\nJust like BetterTouchTool this app by Andreas Hegenberg is a very feature rich and highly customizable windows management tool.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can either snap or use shortcuts for predefined areas.\nWindow snapping can be customized for each corner and and side (except bottom).\n\n*You can define snap areas for any sort of window position and dimension.\n\n*Shortcut behavior may be customized depending on application.\n\n\n \n\n\nA: Update in 2018:\nRejoice, this is now an OS feature!\nTry dragging your window slowly against another one, you'll encounter some resistance. You can use this to line them up quite easily.\nI can't remember for sure when they added this, but I believe it was in OS X v10.12 Sierra.\n", "Q: Google Mail for iOS: How to disable image resizing? I occasionally mail screenshots to colleagues and clients from the official  Google Mail app on my iPhone.\nApparently, it automatically scales them down:\n\nThe image originally was a 1.9 MB screenshot from the new iPad.\nI checked the app and the settings but was unable to find a way to disable this behavior.\n\nA: At the moment you cannot configure this. As an alternative you can use the native email app which will ask you if you want to resize large images and let you choose their new size.\n\nA: You could also use a service like Dropbox and mail them the link. A bit less convenient but you'd make sure that no resizing is happening.\n", "Q: How can I install OS X Lion on a new HDD? I need OS X Lion on a new HDD that I am preparing to install in a MacBook.\nSince I don't have an existing disk to boot up and Apple isn't selling flash drives with it (or are they?), how do I use it for booting?\nSomething to keep in mind: I may ultimately be restoring a partition with a Time Machine backup, but I need to boot in OS X first to get to Disk Utility or the Time Machine restoration interface.\n\nA: If you have a copy of Lion already downloaded you can use the instructions here to create your own. The installation image is in the downloaded package and can be restore using Disk Utility.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Add the InstallESD.dmg image to Disk Utility\n  \n*Select empty USB drive and go to restore tab\n  \n*Make the InstallESD the source\n  \n*Make the USB Drive the target\n  \n*Click Restore\n  \n\nAlternatively you can purchase a Lion install USB drive from your local Apple Store or online here for $ 70.00.\nIf you only redoing the actual OSX partition and already had Lion installed, you can use Cmd+R during boot to access the Recovery partition which will allow you to download OSX Lion or restore from Time Machine.\nMountain Lion is only available to registered developers with access to the Mac Developer Section, but the manual process above works exactly the same.\n\nA: Apple actually thought about this exact scenario. If your MacBook is from Mid-2010 or later and has previously had Lion installed on it, you should be able to use Lion Internet Recovery. It's similar to using the Recovery Partition, but intended for cases where that partition is not available (e.g. a new hard drive.) Hold down Cmd-R while booting, and it will download the recovery partition from Apple and then boot into the normal recovery partition.\nOf course, this will only work if your computer has Internet Recovery support in its EFI. This was originally only available in computers that shipped with Lion, but has since been added to all MacBooks back to the Mid-2010 model via Software Update. So if you were previously running Lion and kept up to date on your updates, then you should be able to restore just by holding down Cmd-R while booting and connecting to the internet.\nMagic.\nFor completeness, here's a list of computers that support Internet Recovery.\n\nA: The easiest way is to download CarbonCopyCloner, and purchase a USB to SATA cable.  When you start the copying process, CCC will notice that your new disk doesn't have the recovery partition and offer to make it for you.  At that point, it will shrink the existing partition on your drive, and create the boot partition.  At that point, your drive is bootable to it's recovery partition.  From there, you can either install Lion from the App store (which is what I did), let CCC copy data over, or do your Time Machine restore (didn't test time machine.)  Should you find CCC worthwhile, purchase a license. \n\nA: It would be fairly easy to locate a new-in-box Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard installer DVD, probably for sale for less than US $25. Do a Google search for computer stores that might have one in stock. If you are a Mobile Me member, Apple will send you a Snow Leopard DVD for free as part of the move to iCloud efforts.\nSo the next question would be, exactly what model MacBook do you have, and will it be compatible with a Snow Leopard DVD installer. You'll also have to check which version of Snow Leopard (10.6.0 or 10.6.4, for instance) is on that DVD.\nOnce you install a working copy of any version of 10.6 on that hard drive and boot up the MacBook with it, you can download the combo update for 10.6.8, which gives you access to the Apple Store, where you can buy, download and install Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.\n\nA: I'll add yet another option to the list: before you remove the old HD, use the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant to copy its recovery partition to a flash drive.  Then, after you replace the HD, you can boot from that and use it to reinstall Lion and/or recover your system from Time Machine.  There are a number of similar options that can be a little confusing, so here's an attempt at clarifying their differences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a Lion installer (USB drive) from Apple.  Advantages: you can boot from this and reinstall Lion and/or recover from Time Machine without needing an internet connection.  Disadvantage: costs $69.\n\n*Create your own Lion installer drive (per Diago's answer) using a downloaded Lion installer app.  Advantages: just like the purchased installer, you can boot from this and reinstall Lion and/or recover from Time Machine without needing an internet connection.  Disadvantages: you need to download the installer first (around 4GB), and it requires an 8GB or larger flash drive.\n\n*Create a Lion Recovery drive (per my answer above) using an existing Lion system and Apple's Lion Recovery Disk Assistant.  Advantages: you can boot from this and recover from Time Machine (and/or reinstall Lion if you have an internet connection and enough time).  Disadvantages: you must create this before removing the old HD, it requires an 1GB or larger flash drive, and since it won't include the full Lion installer you'll need an internet connection (and 4GB worth of patience) to reinstall Lion with it.\n\n*Use Lion Internet Recovery (per BJ Homer's answer).  Advantages: doesn't require any advance preparation; as above, you can boot from this and recover from Time Machine and/or reinstall Lion (if you have enough time).  Disadvantages: requires an internet connection and new enough firmware; since everything is coming over the internet, booting will be slower than with your own recovery drive (and again, reinstalling Lion will require 4GB worth of patience).\n\n", "Q: How can I back up my app data? I have some app data that I'd like to preserve when the time for a new iPhone rolls around.  This app does not (seem to) have any cloud-syncing functionality.  I regularly sync my iPhone to iTunes via USB on a Macbook Air running OS X 10.5.8.  How can I ensure that this app's data is backed up, so as to re-use it on a new device?\n\nA: Vlad's answer is good, and he's absolutely right.\nAn alternative to iTunes would be to use an iOS device browser. This would be especially good if you only wanted to back up one app's data rather than the whole device. Options of these include Phone Disk and PhoneView.\n\nA: To backup your device to iCloud:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Settings app.\n\n*Go to iCloud > Backup & Storage.\n\n*If you enable iCloud Backup all your data will automatically be backed up each night.\n\n*Or you can press Back Up Now to immediately perform a backup of all your data.\n\n\nTo restore your data to the same phone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you backed up and that the backup completed successfully.\n\n*Delete all data on the phone by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. -- WARNING: This will delete all your data, so make sure you have it backed up, especially anything not syncing to iCloud.\n\n*Follow the steps below for a new phone.\n\n\nTo restore your data to a new Phone:\n\n\n*\n\n*During the Setup Assistant, choose to Restore from iCloud Backup.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This will only work if you have less than 5 GB of data on the device. Otherwise you will need to buy more space from Apple or choose to not sync certain things (e.g. Photos and Videos). If do the latter, realize that when you erase all your settings all that data will be gone unless you copied it somewhere else besides iCloud.\n\n\nA: If you take a full backup of your iPhone (right click on it in iTunes and choose Back Up) and then restore it to a new phone, all data will be preserved, including apps' data:\n\niTunes will back up the following information\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Contacts* and Contact Favorites (regularly sync contacts to a computer or cloud service such as iCloud to back them up).\n  \n*App Store Application data including in-app purchases (except the Application itself, its tmp and Caches folder).\n  \n*Application settings, preferences, and data, including documents.\n\nFrom iTunes: About iOS backups.\n\nA: If you have jailbreak on your device, you can use \"Apps Manager\" tweak (https://repo.xarold.com/pack/appdatamanager) to locally backup/restore data by app. It works fine even on iOS 10 and 11.\n\nA: i dont know about i cloud but with itunes it back ups everything\n\nA: Only the best thing to save data is icloud\n", "Q: Set different double click times for physical click and trackpad double-tap When clicking my trackpad physically, I want the double click speed to be as fast as possible. When using the tap-to-click feature, though, I want it to be a tiny bit slower. Is there any way to set this, either natively or with third party apps?\n\nA: You can rule out SteerMouse, I just connected a second mouse and there is only one setting for double-click delay shown. Based on that I'm doubtful of USB Overdrive's claim:\n\"The USB Overdrive can easily handle several USB devices at once and can assign different settings to each one.\" - but it's probably worth a look!\nI think ControllerMate could do it if the developer felt like it - it's a way more configurable approach and is flexible enough to build complex control schemes for HOTAS game controllers. You should register your interest in being able to control the Magic Trackpad with a quick email. I don't know for sure that ControllerMate can't do what you want, it all depends on whether its building block approach sees a \"Source\" for each mouse-like device or whether it just uses the kernel's mouse driver output and sees an aggregate of control input for the two devices. There is a time-limited trial available.\n", "Q: Upgrade dual booted MacBook Pro to Lion from Snow Leopard/Ubuntu I have a MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard and Ubuntu on separate partitions. I use rEfit to choose which operating system I want to boot into. I would like to upgrade to Lion, but I'm concerned this will cause major problems due to my partitioning scheme. Has anyone else done this?\n\nA: I used to dual boot fedora and snow leopard on a macbook pro and upgraded it to Lion no problems. You should just be able to upgrade as normal without altering your ubuntu partition, although as per Vlads answer it's always best to take a full backup first (not that I'm always very good at following that advice myself).\n\nA: Lion upgrade should not touch your Ubuntu partition (unless you choose to repartition/format the disk). You might need to reinstall/update rEfit as well to be able to boot into Ubuntu after upgrade.\nI highly recommend you take a full backup of your disk image before the upgrade to an external drive. Better safe than sorry!\n", "Q: Can you apply jailbreak tweaks to a non-jailbroken device using a file browser such as Phone Disk? Is it possible to use an iOS browser for Mac such as Phone Disk to apply a jailbreak tweak to a non-jailbroken iOS device?\n\nA: It depends.\nThere are some hacks, such as a hidden panorama mode, which reportedly work without a jailbreak. The App to use on your Mac or PC to make the necessary changes to tweak your iPhone is called iBackupBot. I'll bet if you dig around those files, you may find more cool things. \nRemember, a jailbreak consists of a firmware image which has been modified, presumably at the binary level. (Odds are that jail breakers don't have access to iOS's actual source code. So, they'd use tools like binary/hex editors.) Hacks that require binary changes can't be used without changing the code that the phone executes. Changing the binary code is the essence of a jailbreak. \nHowever, sometimes, as in the case of the hidden panorama mode mentioned above, apps (or even parts of iOS, more below) will read \"settings\" or \"preferences\" from external files. In those cases, simply supplying another value by editing property-list files may cause the app to act differently.  \nApps that tap into the Settings app to store their settings write those settings to the phone's persistent storage as property-lists, which are simply a special form of XML.\nIn the panorama mode example, the Camera app looks inside the relevant property-list file to check for a \"flag\" or a switch which will turn panorama mode on or off. There just isn't any user interface for turning the mode on or off. (For clarity's sake: The XML to turn panorama on is not in the same place that most settings are.)\nUsing the tool mentioned in the article, I've noticed that technically, which icons are shown on SpringBoard is also editable. There are tens of property-list files which configure the system, you just need to have access to them and know what values might be useful.\niOS uses a lot of \"Property Lists\" and XML, and knowing what does what can yield interesting results. Just bear in mind that most of the \"useful\" hacks are either available via Settings, or only via a binary jailbreak.\n\nA: No, you cannot run jailbreak tweaks without being jailbroken.\nTo jailbreak, from the lowest-level point-of-view, means that you have the ability to patch the kernel (modify the core operating system code). A couple of the kernel patches that are common in every jailbreak  is one that mounts the / partition as read-write (so you can modify operating system files) and one that makes it so you can run unsigned code (either code that isn't approved by Apple or approved code that has been modified).\nAlmost all jailbreak tweaks make use of CydiaSubstrate (MobileSubstrate) which allows you to hook into running processes (run your own code inside them). Hooking works by rewriting the beginning of functions in a process's code, and that requires code signing to be disabled (which requires the kernel patch mentioned earlier). Also, CydiaSubstrate needs to inject itself into launchd (the process that manages all other processes in iOS), and that can only be done as root (the superuser) which requires placing a script in /private/etc/rc.d (a directory whose contents are each executed as root when the operating system boots) which requires write access to the / partition.\nAdditional Information\nThe actual iOS operating system is on a partition separate from your data. The user/data partition (/dev/disk0s1s2) is mounted at /private/var and can be written to. The operating system partition (/dev/disk0s1s1) is mounted at / and cannot be written to unless you've patched the kernel.\nIn your iOS filesystem browser on your computer, you can only access files in /private/var/mobile/Media. This is because the USB filesystem access daemon afcd (the code that your iOS filesystem browser connects to on the device) is jailed to that directory (it cannot access anything outside of it). When you jailbreak, you can install afc2d which is a replacement for afc that is no longer jailed.\niOS apps are jailed to their own directory and cannot access anything outside of themselves. \nEditing your iOS backup does allow some simple modifications to be made. The backup, however, only contains files from the user/data partition (/private/var), so you will only be able to modify files there.\n\nA: No. Tweaks and items found outside of the App Store are not given permission to run on iOS. Any program must pass a series of checks before it is allowed to execute. Jailbreaking removes (most of) these checks.\nMoreover, they all require various frameworks and libraries also not included in Apple's mobile operating system.\nLastly, you may only copy things to your user account. Tweaks and apps found in Cydia require root access (and that can only come by way of jailbreaking).\n\nA: If the tweak is for a specific app that is in the Appstore. for example phantom for Snapchat. since you can get to the app folders of Snapchat could you manually extract each file to where it goes\n\nA: Some of these old posts contain misinformation. You can install cydia apps/tweaks and maintain a sandbox.\nThe weblin and ipwnstore are cool stuff. Most of my tweaks still do rely on being out of the sandbox.\n", "Q: iMessage Weird Behavior I have multiple mobile devices (2x iPhone, 2x iPad) in my home, all which share the same iTunes account between them.  When iMessage is used to exchange messages between two of the devices (e.g. the two iPhones), the messages appear to be sent from and received by the same identity.  The only way I have found to correct this by turning off iMessage on one of the devices and only using SMS.\nIs there a way to associate iMessage with a different iTunes account than other apps on the same device?\n\nA: If you go into Settings > Messages, you should be able to choose which email addresses you get iMessages to. It's under the Receive At option which let's you input additional email addresses.\nAdditionally, you can even sign out of your iMessage account without affecting the iTunes account by tapping on the name of the account you are currently signed in as (on the same screen).\nHere's what it looks like on an iPhone:\n\n\nA: iMessages on an iPhone will always receive on the phone number of that phone, and (by default) the email address associated with the iTunes ID you logged into.\nOn an iPad or iPod, there is obviously no phone number and so they will only listen on the email address of the Apple ID.\nHowever you are able to add additional email addresses to receive messages against.  You are welcome to create any number of additional iCloud accounts for each device and add them into Settings > Messages > Receive At.\nThen you just need to remember to use the correct email address to start a new conversation with.  You can have contact entries for \"My iPad/myipad@me.com\" and \"The Wife's iPod/thewifesipod@me.com\" etc if you wish to effectively address a device directly rather than the user of the device.\n", "Q: Lion Fullscreen Desktop Switching Quirk I make Java programs, many of which require input from the command line before they actually open a window. When I'm using the Terminal in fullscreen mode and I run java Program, it jumps over to an open desktop and then does nothing, causing me to have to switch back to the Terminal to do the stuff it's asking and then switch over. I know it's a really simple fix of not using fullscreen but is there any way to let the focus stay on the command line until the program is ready to open the window?\n\nA: I'd recommend not allocating any GUI elements until after the command line input is finished. \nIf you run your app from a non-fullscreen Terminal, you'll probably notice that the app launches in the Dock (even if no windows appear) before you finish entering your command line stuff. This is probably what's causing the Space-switch.\n\nA: @CajunLuke is right, Apple's Java Virtual Machine prepares the desktop to display a peer component, even before setVisible() launches the event dispatch thread. It's a feature, most of the time. One way to achieve the desired effect is to launch the GUI component in a separate JVM, as shown here using ProcessBuilder.\nSee also Using Headless Mode in the Java SE Platform.\n", "Q: No Scroll Lock on Apple Keyboard My StarTech sv215micusba KVM requires that I use Scroll Lock, Scroll Lock, Enter, but my Apple keyboard doesn't have a Scroll Lock key.  I found this reference:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1216\nBut it refers to key combinations used for Windows functionality (driver-dependent).  What combo would I need to press in order to send the correct sequence to my KVM switch?\n\nA: Having had a look at the StarTech SV215MICUSBA manual (PDF), on page 7 it says:\n\nTo initialize Mac keyboard mapping, please execute the following\n  hotkey  sequence:\n[scroll],[scroll], [F2], [Enter]\n  or\n  [ctrl] [ctrl] [F2] [Enter]\nOnce this has been done, the following keyboard mapping will apply:\n\nThen in the table below, it indicates that the Scroll Lock Lock key on a PC keyboard is mapped to F14 on a Mac keyboard. \nAssuming you have a full Apple keyboard, its probably worth trying this out.\n\nA: Some KVM switches have alternate methods of switching besides Scroll Lock. I would read the manual to see if there is any similar feature on your KVM.\nOtherwise, you might need to resort to having an additional PC keyboard hooked up to the KVM switch with the sole purpose of sending the Scroll Lock command.\n\nA: If you have a large Apple keyboard with an F14 Key, Shift-F14 has been documented to work as a Scroll Lock key in Excel. I don't have any documentation about your sv215micusba device, but if you have a large Apple keyboard, that key combination might work.\n\nA: Use the free remap tool for macbook available at https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/index.html.en, enable functions keys in the settings of the keyboard, and remap the key you want to F14.\nExample for F6 to F14: add the following xml in your private.xml file inside ~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Swap F6 to PrintScroll</name>\n    <identifier>private.swap_F6_to_printscroll</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ \n    KeyCode::F6,\n    KeyCode::F14\n    </autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n\nA: None of the above solutions were working for me, and I was unable to remap my KVM's (Syba SY-KVM31034) hotkey, so I wrote this simple tool that sends the necessary double scroll lock signal to my KVM. It can even be assigned to a key combo: https://github.com/benjaminstout/osx-kvm\n", "Q: Why does look-up not work on every webpage in Chrome? Lion introduced a new feature called look up:\n\n... which can be invoked by double-tapping a word with three fingers. This works fine most of the time, but I've noticed that it fails many times in Google Chrome (I'm running 18.0 beta).\nFor example, it works fine on this website, but fails on http://www.gigaom.com. If I try both websites on Safari, they both work. Why does Chrome have this problem? Is it an issue with the website owner not following standards? Is it a bug in Chrome? Is there any temporary workaround?\n\nA: This bug is known to the Chrome developers and has been filed under...\nIssue 90461: Dictionary keyboard shortcut doesn't work in Lion\nBasically the problems are timing issues for some websites which take too long to respond to information needed to show the dictionary.\nThis is what @resek@chromium.org says:\n\nThere's likely not much that we can do here. We have to block the UI\nthread to implement this feature, which is bad and so that's done on a\ntimeout. If the web page takes too long to respond for the information\nwe need to display the popup, we give up and unblock the UI. If we\ndidn't do this, Chrome would look like it's hung, waiting on the web\npage to respond.\nWe collect timing information about this, and most pages succeed well\nbelow the timeout, but there's also some class of pages that do not\nrespond in time (more than 1500ms, which is what starts to be\nperceived as sluggish/hung).\n\n", "Q: Prevent Windows 7 from activating twice on Vmware Fusion I have Windows 7 VM in VMWare Fusion and I often copy the file from my macbook to my IMac.\nFusion ask if I copied or moved but any answer will made Windows 7 ask activating again.\nI tought that Fusion was virtualizing hardware so Win7 should not recognize any hardware change between machines.\nHow can I prevent activating again?\n\nA: These are likely two separate issues. First, VMWare keeps an identifier for each VM, and can tell when you have moved or copied one over. Whether you change or keep the UUID is more to make sure that particular instance of VMWare doesn't get confused. You definitely don't want more than one with the same UUID. Since this is also stored in the SMBIOS and readable by the virtual OS, keeping it might help.\nAs far as Windows Activation, VMs do virtualize most of the hardware, but they will for example report the actual CPU in the box. For example, even if you allocate only one virtual processor, it will still say \"i7 Quad Core\" in the System properties. Is the CPU for your MacBook and iMac different?\n", "Q: Cached restored files and their logs after the force shutdown (crash). Where are they? Where can I find the cached files or logs from which Mac OS X restores to its current position after the force shutdown (hard freeze problem)?\nMoreover, same question with Google Chrome: from where does it restore previous tabs after the crash?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Some of the files used in restoring applications are located at ~/Library/Saved Application State. These files are updated while an application is running, and if it crashes they are used by the system to restore it (if the application crashes during the restore process, OS X offers to discard the saved state when relaunching a second time).\nBut some applications such as Chrome store more information elsewhere. Chrome stores your open tabs and other data in\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default. There I see files such as Last Session and Last Tabs. (For comparison, Safari uses ~/Library/Safari/LastSession.plist.)\n", "Q: Is it safe to use my US iPhone/iPad charger with a simple European plug adapter? I'm using the US wall adapter that came with my iPhone to charge it:\n\nWhen I travel to Europe, is it safe to use this with a simple US-European adapter, or do I need a transformer or some other device to step to the appropriate voltage/current? Do I risk frying my device?\n\n\nA: Yes, you can use the simple adapter.  If you read the tiny fine print on the plug end you see \"110-240V 50-60Hz\" which means it will work on most common electrical systems around the world without a transformer.\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly safe to use a simple adapter for EU. You do not need additional transformers. When I went in visit to Europe I got one adapter exactly like the one in your post, the black one.\n", "Q: 'Find My Mac' says that it is already in use, how to fully remove previous configuration? I posted a question earlier about using Find My Mac while my computer was sleeping, and after doing some research I noticed that I had 'Wake for network access' already enabled. So when I went to check iCloud again, I noticed it saying this (Find My Mac already in use): \n\nIf I check the box, I then get this alert message: \n\nThe only thing I can think of, is that I may have signed in with another iCloud account on this computer (I have an old iTunes account, plus a mobile me converted account that I actually use). \nbmike mentioned he had see registration issues with Lion updates, and not sure if this was related to something similar, or to possibly linking this computer with another iCloud account originally. I want that original one gone, and only my new one to go. \nMy question is: Is there any where else I should look for remnants of this 'other' iCloud account, to not cause other issues? I know this was working at some point, even recently, so it confuses me on what happened here. \nUpdate: So I went ahead and checked this, clicked Continue below, and it appears to work fine. I would still like to find what ID or anything else that would cause this though to help understand it if it happens again.\n\nA: I had this happen to me a couple of months ago.  I was perplexed, as you were, about what could be causing it.  I figured out the following, but as there's no information for this online it could be incorrect:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find My Mac is tied to the serial number of your Mac\n\n*Find My Mac was partially enabled before iCloud was released\n\n*Since it was partially enabled, a previous MobileMe account could cause conflicts.\n\n\nAgain, I have no definitive proof for this.  But I got this notice on a fresh install of the operating system, only after upgrading my MobileMe account to an iCloud account.\nSo if I were you I wouldn't worry about it.  Most likely it's just a MobileMe bug that never got quite resolved.\n", "Q: Cut functionality shortcut for folders and files I'm accustomed to ctrl+x, ctrl+v combination to move files and folders using only the keyboard. Can I get the same functionality on OS X Lion?\n\nA: Yes, but it's a little different in Lion.\nIn both the move and the copy situation, you use ⌘ CommandC to put a file on the clipboard.\nWhen pasting:\n\n\n*\n\n*To copy the file to the new location, press ⌘ CommandV.\n\n\n*To move the file to the new location, press ⌥ Option⌘ CommandV.\n\n\nA: You could use cmd +x too : if I'm not mistaken, cut exists in Mac OS since the 10.4.8 version, it's just disable. \nTo get the combination cmd +x working, you could just enable it, by opening a terminal and run this command :\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AllowCutForItems 1\n\nYou could re-disable it, by changing the final \"1\" to \"0\".\nEDIT : \nI didn't try this trick for a while, so it appears that it's not working under Lion (It's was working on leopard for me). \nAnyway jtbandes's solution is the best way to do cut and paste :) \n", "Q: Home Sharing, but without syncing purchases? At home we have two iTunes accounts. We do not wish to share our purchases as, for example, we have very different tastes in music.\nWe are looking to purchase an AppleTV that we can both use to stream our content from iTunes.\nI've already read on another question that the standard way to handle this situation is to set up home sharing using one of our Apple IDs for all of the devices.\nHowever, I've also read that setting up Home Sharing will cause any purchases on the other account to be added into the library of the home sharing account, and thus copied onto all linked devices. Is there a way to prevent this?\n\nA: Home Sharing is done under a different Apple ID than the one the computer is authorized for. I have my computer registered under my ID (with automatic downloads on!), and Home Sharing set up under a family ID.\nTo do this correctly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are signed in to your ID under the Store menu.\n\n*Log in to the shared ID with the appropriate command under the Advanced menu.\n\n*Voilà!\n\n\nAlternatively, you don't even need to use Home Sharing. You can play tracks without enabling it, as long as sharing is enabled under iTunes > Preferences > Sharing > Share my library on my local network. Enabling Home Sharing will let you copy files to the local library, whereas this option will not.\n\nA: I've got this same situation going at home; two computers with separate iTunes Store accounts, an AppleTV that pulls content from both of them, and iTunes Home Sharing turned on.\nThe automatic syncing behavior is optional and, I believe, opt-in. When you turn on Home Sharing and select it in iTunes, you'll see this down in the bottom right corner:\n\nWhen you click the \"Settings\" button, you'll see this window:\n\nAs you can see, you have plenty of options. Simply uncheck the things you don't want automatically synced, and you're good to go.\n\nA: Home Sharing works between devices using the same Apple ID. Devices using the second ID will be left out of your Home Sharing setup.\n", "Q: How much is should pay and from where I can find tools to develop for IPhone and IPad I am new to mac dev world. every where i try to download or do something i find \"you should pay $99\".\nI want xcode to develop these apps, and test them before putting on the market place.\nhow much i should pay in total and from where I can download this xcode to start programming?\nplease provide me with links.\n\nA: Well... it's not really $99.

Now that you can sign up for Netflix with your Apple ID and use that for billing, does that allow you to get it billed to your iTunes Credit rather than credit card?\n\nA: According to this Bloomberg article:\n\nNetflix Inc. (NFLX) is deepening its ties with Apple Inc. (AAPL) by\n  allowing owners of Apple TV set-top boxes to sign up for the\n  video-streaming service directly and pay through their iTunes\n  accounts.\n\nMore details and support links can be found on Netflix's iTunes billing page.\nFinally, according to the current US iTunes terms and conditions:\n\nWhen making purchases, content credits are used first, followed by\n  Gift Certificate, iTunes Card, or Allowance Account credits; your\n  credit card or PayPal account is then charged for any remaining\n  balance.\n\nWhile the current T&C doesn't directly mention the Netflix subscription situation., the iTunes Card (\"credit\") comes before the credit card or PayPal account. However, since Apple also has your credit card information, as this Fast Company article notes, your credit card might actually be used to pay for your Netflix subscription instead of the iTunes credits. \n", "Q: Windows RDP client that allows key mapping and easy use of Function Keys I often use RDP clients (like Microsoft Remote Desktop or CoRD) to access my work machines to use Visual Studio at work. This actually works pretty well, except for when it comes to using the Function keys (especially F10 and F11 for debugging). \nAs you can see, the problem is that the Mac OS now also uses these keys for mute and volume down respectively. You can hold down the 'fn' key and get access to these, and sometimes that doesn't even work directly, you have to hold down Command too. This slows me down quite a bit. I have built up some serious muscle memory for Visual Studio key commands, and would like to replicate them as close as possible through Remote Desktop. \nI am looking for a workflow that will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow me to RDP into a Windows machine (Windows 7 if that matters)\n\n*Customize key commands JUST for that application, so that if RDP is the current application, hitting F10 will interact with the debugger in my RDP connection, and not mute my Mac\n\n*If I can't map those exact keys, at least have a way to map two unused keys to the similar function key in the RDP session (as in, if I could map F10 and F11 to F16 and F17 respectively, that could work. \n\n\nIt looks like Microsoft's RDP client allows you to change key commands, but not add new ones. And wasn't sure if there was another method I could use to incorporate these commands just for when RDP was the front-most application\n\nA: The easiest way might be to disable the Fn key. Since you say that using Fn+F10 works, you could go into System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard, and enable Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys. This way you no longer need to press Fn to send F10.\nThe second solution is on the PC side. You could install a utility such as AutoHotkey on your PC and remap the keys there. That way the keybindings will only work on the PC. Lifehacker has nice looking tutorial about this. In AutoHotkey, you can decide which applications the shortcut applies to, but in your case it seems like a global hotkey would work since it is running on the PC side.\nAnother solution might be to try one of the ways to create keyboard shortcuts menitoned in this Lifehacker article. This article's goal is to help you do similar things that AutoHotkey let's you do on the Mac.\n\nA: Looks like the new Jump Desktop app for Mac will do this. \nSee: \n\nI've not tried it yet, but the iPad app is highly regarded.\nhttp://jumpdesktop.com/jump-desktop-mac-rdp-vnc \n", "Q: How do I transfer my Disney Digital Copy movie to iTunes using Lion? I want to try this \"Digital Copy\" to iCloud movie deal but when I pop in the DVD it says:\n\nYou can't open the application Up because PowerPC applications are no longer supported.\n\nIs there any other work around besides using Snow Leopard or a Windows PC?\nI just want to watch Disney Pixar's Up on my iPad.\n\nA: I agree 100% with Adam's answer that DRM is a horrible thing, and \"Digital Copy\" in particular is a bad joke; see here.\nHowever, I'll point out you can still watch your Up! Digital Copy on your Mac, even if OS X Lion doesn't support the PowerPC-based installer software on Disney's antiquated disc.  I had the same issue and solved it as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes.\n\n*Put the disc in your Mac's DVD drive.\n\n*In the left navigation area, select the disc.\n\n*You should see a page on the right asking you to Enter Code.  Enter the unique activation code that came with your copy of Up!, then click Redeem.\n\n*Authenticate with your iTunes credentials, when prompted.  (Assumption: You have an iTunes account, a working Internet connection, and your Digital Copy code is valid, not expired, and not yet redeemed.)\n\n*After authenticating with iTunes (the service), iTunes (the program) will proceed to copy the now-authorized movie content from your Up! \"Digital Copy\" disc to your Mac.\n\n*Find the new title in your \"Movies\" library.  Watch it on your Mac*.\n\nAll the details, including screenshots, can be found at:\n\n*\n\n*Apple Support - Transferring or downloading an iTunes Digital Copy.\n\n* Worth mentioning:  Even after you get your \"Digital Copy\" into iTunes on your Mac, it remains protected and can only be played back on a device authorized to play back purchases from your iTunes account.  Consequently, you may still prefer using another extraction method on the original movie, in order to yield a liberated version of your content unencumbered with such restrictions.\nSummary: DRM is still a horrible thing, even with the workaround above.\n(p.s. FWIW, this method also worked (for me) for non-Disney titles such as Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!, from Twentieth Century Fox, and Despicable Me, from Universal Studios.  Mentioning this in case somebody else finds this answer but has a non-Disney disc; i.e. it doesn't seem to matter whether the \"Digital Copy\" is Disney or not, the above method should work to authorize & copy the content to iTunes.)\n\nA: Movie DRM is a horrible thing - it's a sad fact that your best option is probably to torrent a HD h264 copy of the movie, and just feel OK about it because you paid for the physical media - even though you can't do anything with it.\nI don't even know a way to install Rosetta to Lion - system binaries are no longer \"Fat\" so even if the installer could be fooled it will probably not work. I know of people who have used it in a VM running Snow Leopard, or who have dual booted with Snow Leopard just to keep ability to run PPC-only apps, but I don't know anyone who has installed Rosetta to Lion.\n\nA: Macs are a bit dumb when it comes to this stuff. New ones work well, but if you got the disk a few years ago when Digital Copy was first included, basically you have to ignore the instructions included with the DVD/Bluray and do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load Itunes \n\n*Put the Disk in  \n\n*Itunes will automatically load the \"redeem this item\" page\n\n*Put your code in and press redeem...\n\n\nNow it will load. I know Chris already gave this answer, but his second instruction of \"In the left navigation area, select the disc.\" is confusing, so I've worded it better.\n", "Q: video player that remembers where you left? Is there a video player that remembers where you left on each video?\nPretty much like listening to podcasts in iTunes, but with videos.\n\nA: Take a look at MPlayerX. I love it. Not only does it remember video location, but also has seamless fast-forward to the next episode of a season.\n", "Q: Why does my 4S keep splitting my text messages? I have an iPhone 4S, and an unlimited data plan, so I text. A lot. Apparently, it has been cutting one to two words off the ends of my text messages to my (non-iPhone-user) fiancé. I've always stayed under 160 characters - it splits those texts. Lately, I've taken to trying to stay under 100 characters, and still, the last 1-2 words get chopped off the end and sent as a new text. I can't find any answers online, and this is getting really aggravating for me and the recipients of my text messages. How do I fix this???\n\nA: I have suffered numerous... Countless compatibility issues between different handsets/carriers. Even when texting in the same country.\nOne thing you have to understand is that a text is normally limited to 160 7-bits characters. Which means that any message containing special characters outside the range of the 7 bits characters will immediately be shorter.\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nDepending on which alphabet the subscriber has configured in the handset, this leads to the maximum individual short message sizes of 160 7-bit characters, 140 8-bit characters, or 70 16-bit characters.\n\nDepending on the characters you use the iPhone will select the character set adapted to the message.\nAlso I noticed that sometimes problems with character encodings and message length appeared when I was receiving messages from another carrier.\nYou should try sending the same message to another phone on the same carrier, then the same message on your carrier to see if the problem can be reproduced in these contexts. \n\nAs a side note you say you have an unlimited data plan. To my knowledge no carrier includes text messages in the data plan. You might want to check if you have unlimited text messages in your plan. If you use iMessage (blue messages on the iPhone) you effectively use the data plan, otherwise (green messages) go through the voice/text plan.\n\nA: I am having the same issue with my texts splitting way under the 160 character count. This is happening to Sprint users since the IOS 5.1 upgrade. This is not happening to iPhone users who are with other carriers. A quick fix (until Sprint fixes this issue) is to space 3 times at the end of your message and it will not split (provided that is not over 160 after the spaces). It does work.\nI have contacted Sprint and they want me to come in and have the prior operating system restored (when I was able to send a complete text). After that they will log it into the system as an issue.\n", "Q: Where is the dividing line (mount point) of the two iOS partitions? I know that iOS has two partitions, but I've never found anywhere that gives clues as to where they split. Is one partition on / and the other on /var/mobile/, or are all the user profiles (/var/root/, /var/wireless/, etc) on the second partition (at /var)? Is it possible to resize these partitions? On the same note, is /var a symbolic link to /private/var/ or is it the other way around?\n\nA: / is the mount point for /dev/disk0s1s1; /private/var is the mount point for /dev/disk0s1s2.\n\ndisk0s1s1 is reserved for iOS system files. It is equivalent to OS X's /System and /Library directories. It is the smaller of the two partitions (the size can be set using Redsn0w or Sn0wbreeze during the jailbreak process). The default size is set to 1 GB for iOS 5 and around 600-700 MB in previous versions.\ndisk0s1s2 is reserved (as of iOS 1.1.3) for user data (3rd party applications, music, photos, etc.). It is the larger of the two and varies depending on the flash memory available (which is dependent on the device purchased).\nThe layout of the disk is stored in /etc/fstab, which is also used by jailbreak tools to make the system partition writable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Source: iOS Forensic Analysis\n\n*Additional reading: The iPhone Wiki\n\nA: One partition is mounted as \"/\" and contains OS, basic apps and firmware upgrades.\nThe other is mounted as \"/private/var\" and contains pretty much everything else (apps, iPhoto data, SMS etc.).\nWhy would you want to resize these partitions? I don't believe it is possible. \n", "Q: How does keychain restore work in other idevice? app A stores passwords in keychain programmatically. One password is stored in one keychain item. Keychain item is a class of type Generic Password. app A is installed & used in idevice1 & idevice2 (ios4.0 & later). Now take the encrypted backup of device1 and restore it in device2.\nDoes it overwrite the keychain items of same match in device2 or stores the keychain items from backup alone?\n\nA: When you restore an iOS backup - all the previous contents are gone so there is no merging of old and new contents. You end up with the current keychain matching the backed up keychain.\nThe only subtle aspect is that if you do not have a passcode lock on the device, some items stored in the keychain are wiped (either not backed up or not restored - it's not clear when this happens). This ensures that you actually have to re-enter mail passwords and such.\nThis protects from someone restoring your backup without your knowledge and then being able to read your email. They either need to know your passcode or your password to make use of a restored keychain and app settings on a new device initially after restore.\n", "Q: How can I get the Parallels Desktop Application Icons in Launchpad? I have the opposite problem of this one; I have Parallels Desktop 6 installed and while I do have the Applications folder in the dock, I don't have links to any of these applications in Launchpad.\nHow can I get these application icons in Launchpad? I'm aware that Parallels has the following knowledge base article which says that there is going to be a folder in Launchpad, but that's not what I want. I'm looking for a way to get all the applications icon to be visible in Launchpad, similar to this:\n\nNote: I had Parallels installed on Snow Leopard (before I had Launchpad), and now I am using Lion.\n\nA: To add an application to Launchpad, you can simply drag it to Launchpad in the Dock.\n\nBut be careful — currently there's no way to remove something from Launchpad that you've added.\n(And if you have items in a folder in Launchpad, you can easily drag them out and organize them as you wish.)\n", "Q: Photo Sharing from iTunes In iTunes, from the Advanced menu, I selected Photos to Share.  I then picked a folder and the hard drive cranked at full speed for good 5-10 minutes.\nI do not see any of the photos on the iPad.  So, who did I actually share the Photos with?\n\nA: Mathias is correct about the proper way to sync photos to your iPad. Sharing photos from iTunes approves them for Home Sharing, a system designed to share iTunes Store purchases and media amongst family members.\nApple Knowledgebase: iTunes: Setting up Home Sharing on your computer\nHome Sharing can also be used to allow access to photos from an AppleTV.\nApple Knowledgebase: Setting up Home Sharing for Apple TV (2nd generation)\n\nA: You don't copy Photos to an iPad using the Advanced menu…\nHere’s how I do it: go to iTunes → Devices → Your iOS Device → Photos → enable “Sync Photos from…” and choose either iPhoto album(s) or a folder on your hard drive. Then press the Sync button in the bottom right corner.\nSee Apple Knowledgebase: iOS and iPod: Syncing photos using iTunes for more details.\n\nA: It seems that Advanced > Choose Photos to Share uses iTunes' Home Sharing feature to share photos with Apple TV devices.\n\nIf you want to sync photos from your computer to the iPad, you can either use PhotoStream or enable photo syncing when you connect the iPad.\n", "Q: Not enough space to migrate from Legacy FileVault to FileVault 2 When I try to change from using Legacy FileVault to the new FileVault in Lion, it says that I don't have enough disk space.\nWhat are my options besides having to delete bunch of files? (20 GB in my case.) Is there any way, for example, to hook up a a large capacity USB thumb drive and tell it to use it for temporary disk storage? What about an external drive?\nI notice that for each 1 GB of files I delete in my User's folder, the amount of additional disk space I need to free is reduced by 2 GB. I'm guessing that this is because it would no longer need to copy that data to a temporary location.\n\nA: I don't know of any way to remap another drive as a scratch space and, when it comes to data integrity I distrust complex solutions.\nFirst, go ahead and clean all caches, and search and destroy old/duplicate/obsolete/redundant files and applications. I often find a lot of clutter, and uneeded installers, in my Download folder. Don't forget to empty the Trash.  You might be pleasantly surprised at how much space you recover. Also see the excellent tip about recovering drive space by temporarily disabling Smart Sleep. \nIf that didn't free up enough space,  solve this problem by copying one more of your larger files, for example in my case I might choose my Aperture Library, to an external drive. An alternative would be to copy a large directory. (In fact, the Aperture Library is a actually a directory structure bundle). Your choice of files should be influenced by what is simple (fewer files from fewer places) and will have the least impact on the system. For example, I would be reluctant to move my media files for fear of damaging their sometimes delicate links from the iTunes Library file. (This fear has been somewhat mitigated by iTunes Match, but still I'm cautious.)\nConfession, I don't really have to copy this file because it's already on my SuperDuper! clone drive, and also backed up offsite for safety—so in reality, I would just check the integrity of those backups and proceed.\nUse copy, not move. While I've never been bitten myself, the reports of problems moving large groups of files to an external drive, particularly when using Finder, are numerous enough to frighten me away from this bad practice. You need to check the integrity of your copy before proceeding. \nProvided you already have another trusted (meaning verifyed), redundant, backup copy of the file(s)—you do, right?—you can now delete the file(s) from your main drive. If not, take the time to make another copy. A file doesn't exist until it exists in three places – Alex Lindsay, The Pixel Corps. \nThe rest should be self-apparent. Turn FileVault off. Copy the file(s) back to your main drive and again verify the integrity of the copied data. Activate FileVault 2—remembering to safeguard the recovery key.\nLaborious, but safe and approved by Apple in that there's no voo-doo involved. \n\nA: I just thought of a way to temporarily free up 2 GB - 8 GB, depending on the amount of RAM you have.\nBy default, Macs have Safe Sleep enabled, which occupies the same amount of space as your RAM. In other words, if you have 4 GB of RAM, it's taking up 4 GB of hard drive space. If you temporarily disable this feature, and delete the hibernation file, you can use that space during the migration process. You can then re-enable safe sleep. Using this tip in addition to @jaberg's suggestions can help free enough space so that the migration is possible.\nTUAW has an article explaining safe sleep and how to disable it.\nThis article might help too: OS X: Changing Hibernation Mode\n", "Q: How can I easily transfer videos from iPhone to iPad iPhone records nicer videos than iPad, but working with iMovie on iPad is more pleasant than on iPhone. How can I easily transfer recorded videos from iPhone to iPad, preferably without using a computer?\nThere are many ways to share photos easily like Photo Stream and direct device to device beaming using the iPhoto app, but these do not work (yet) for videos.\n\nA: If you do not use iCloud and would like access on a PC or a web browser then you can use DropBox, this free app (sign up required) will allow you to save photos and videos to a folder in the cloud. You can access this folder on both iPhone, iPad and also your computer.\nYou also have to give Dropbox permission to access your photos from the iPhone app\n\n\n*\n\n*In the app go to Uploads, (on the bottom)\n\n*Click the + button\n\n*Allow access to your photos\n\n*tap on the videos you wish to put onto your iPad\n\n*choose a folder to upload them into(you can create new folders here too.\n\n*Choose the folder and upload.\n\n*Wait a short time and navigate to the file using DropBox on the iPad. you can then save the video tyo your videos and open in iMovie.\n\n\n\nThe benefit of this over using iCloud is that you are instantly starting the process, iCloud and photostream can take a few minutes to start the sync process, you also have th eoption to be able to open the videos on a web browser, which you cannot do on iCloud.com\n\nA: Since PhotoStream doesn't work for videos, your best bet is probably a 3rd party app.\nIf you're worried about your pictures being stored on the Internet, you might want to try an app such as PhotoSync ($2) or Photo Transfer App ($3). The former seems like it uses your Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection to transfer between the two devices rather than uploading the pictures to a webserver and then downloading them on the other device.\nI believe that any 3rd party app that deals with photos will need to be granted access to location information. The app isn't necessarily using the location information, it's just that that information is embedded inside of pictures taken while location services was enabled. Therefore, since the app could potentially access your location info, it needs privileges to do so, even if it never ends up actually doing so.\n\nA: Just email them to yourself. You may have to trim some of the video but it's simple and works.\n\nA: If you have Apple's iPhoto for iOS you can \"beam\" photos and movies between devices.\nSome tutorials:\n\n\n*\n\n*How-to: Beam your photos with iPhoto for iOS @ TUAW\n\n*How to set up and use iPhoto Beam on iOS @ cnet\nThey describe how to do it with photos but movies should work as well.\n", "Q: Is it possible to automatically sign in to the Mac App Store?

Or is there any way so I get signed in automatically? \n\nA: No, this option doesn't exist. (Perhaps because it would be to some extent a security risk.) You might remain signed in for a short period of time, but you can't automatically log yourself in.\n", "Q: How many External Hard Drives can I plug to Airport Extreme? I need to backup all my computer data. I'm thinking of buying 3 External Hard Drives and connect them to Airport Extreme. Can I do this? \n\nA: The constraint is be the number of ports available on your USB hub.\nAny connected hard drives should appear in Mac OS X. \nUse a self-powered usb hub and connect hard drives your hub. Only then will multiple external drives have enough power to run.\nAlso see store.apple.com for related questions.\n\n\nA: As shown on the Apple website, the Airport Extreme has only one USB port:\n\nHowever, you can use a USB hub to connect multiple devices to it.\n\n(I also wouldn't be surprised if Apple eventually creates a Thunderbolt-compatible version of the Airport Extreme — and Thunderbolt devices can be daisy-chained, so you might be able to connect more than one hard drive at a time.)\nFor a single hard drive, you might also like the Time Capsule which has an integrated hard drive.\nFor a more flexible and heavy-duty solution for multiple drives, you could use something like Drobo.\n\nA: Yes you can - Apple's web site says \"multiple printers, multiple hard drives\" and mentions using them with a USB hub.\nDon't expect fancy NAS or RAID features though, you will just be able to share the existing partitions.\n\nA: The problem is how much power USB on the Airport Extreme supplies. \nIf you had one external drive, then 2.5 inch drives will be fine with the power they get, 3.5 inch drives usually are not. I had one drive that came with a special USB cable with two connectors, one for data + power, the other to get a bit more power. That won't work obviously. \nFor multiple drives, you need a hub. For multiple drives without their own power supply, you will need a POWERED USB hub, that is a USB hub with its own power plug. Be careful when you order one, because some people sell their unpowered hubs as \"USB POWERED\", which means it tries to get its power from the Airport Extreme USB port. That's not going to work. \nIf you buy 3.5 inch drives that usually come with their own power supply, they might be fine with an unpowered hub, but I wouldn't take the risk and get a powered hub. \n", "Q: Using an Apple Keyboard Dock as a keyboard for a computer? Is it possible to use an Apple Keyboard Dock as a keyboard for a computer, rather than an iDevice?\nAs I can, obviously, connect it to a computer via USB, I think it'd be great if I could as I love Apple's keyboards but I don't really want to fork out for a wired/wireless Apple keyboard if I've just got this sitting here.\n\nA: It’s not possible to connect it to a Mac. The Apple Store detail page for this product says that it’s only compatible with the iPad. Note that the full product name is “iPad Keyboard Dock”.\nHere are some ways you can use the iPad Keyboard Dock, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the dock to your computer with the USB cable included with\nyour iPad to sync iPad and charge its battery.\n\n*Connect the dock to an electrical outlet using the iPad 10W USB Power Adapter (included with\nyour iPad) to charge the iPad battery.\n\n*Use the dock to hold your iPad\nat the perfect angle to compose email and notes using the keyboard or\nto watch your favorite videos or photo slideshows.\n\n*Connect the dock\nto a TV or video projector using a compatible cable such as the iPad\nDock Connector to VGA Adapter or the Apple Component or Composite AV\nCable.\n\n*Connect the dock to a stereo or speakers using an AV cable or\na stereo audio cable to play music from iPad.\n\n\nA: Based on the available pins on the 30-pin dock connector it is almost certainly a USB keyboard -thee's no pairing so it can't be Bluetooth. In practical terms it would be almost impossible to use it connected to a Mac though - you would need to recable it completely, or make an adapter cable with a female 30-pin connector to USB adapter. Probably it also uses sense resistors on pin 27 (Data+) as Apple likes to use to identify various things like the 10W iPad charger (a sense resistor is what lets the iPad know it is connected to the right charger and allows it to begin charging) and you maybe need to find and remove it to make it appear as a regular USB keyboard.\nThe pinout for the connector is shown here.\nHey I was just browsing Sparkfun - they have just what you need if you decide to try and build this hack: PodSocket Breakout. It's the female Dock connector (as you would find on the bottom of an iPad).\n\nA: I use the dock keyboard for iPad on my Mac mini.   I plug the USB in and  everything works.   I charge my iPad with a regular adapter. I said no charge but it charges anyway; just left it plugged in. \n", "Q: Mac OS \"Go to desktop #\" keyboard shortcourt I am looking for a shortcut to change desktop in Mac OS X (10.7.3)\nI am used to awesome WM in which you can do + to go to desktop #\nI am looking for a keyboard shortcut in MacOS X to do this.

The screen refreshes from video memory, and the video memory is modified by the OS or by OpenGL commands executing on the GPU.\nIf you run two quicktime movies side by side, the will separately update the video memory, and could have two different frame rates based on the system load and several other factors.\nAny tools to measure framerate would need to measure just one applications framerate.  Many applications, such as video players and video games, can report their own framerate.  \nFurther, any software tool will consume system resources that may affect framerate.\nWhen I've had to objectively measure framerate for an app that didn't measure and report framerate itself I've used a high speed camera (for consumers the PS3 camera is considered high speed) and then examined the frames of video for display updates to determine the framerate.\nThe Macbook Pro display refreshes 60 frames per second, and no faster framerate can be displayed on it. These techniques would only measure framerates below 60.\n\nA: It is usually application-provided or developer-tool provided. If you want to know for some particular application look for a developer console or other debug output. If you are a developer, use the OpenGL tools in Xcode's Instruments such as OpenGL Profiler.\nYou need to get this information from the application because it is the only thing that can count how many times it is refreshing display per second. the hardware refresh goes on regardless, if nothing changed in the frame buffer it gets refreshed anyway.\n\"About This Mac\" used to show the hardware refresh rate for each display but doesn't appear to any more. It is almost certainly 60 or 75 Hz for your internal LCD.\n\nA: You might be able to use Apple's OpenGL Profiler for something like this by attaching it to a process and then seeing what values it displays for the frame rate. You can get it at Apple's website.\n", "Q: Attempt to download app, says it's already installed on my Iphone4 I had the sirusxm app on my phone and everytime it would give me problems I would delete it and reinstall it.  I forgot that I had just recently changed my email password from my laptop, which is synced with my phone.  When I went to download the app after having once again delete it due to having problems, the column which you click on to download quickly changes to purchased.  The app is not on my phone.  How can I get it?\n\nA: There is a difference between an app that has been purchased and one that is installed. To install a purchased app, open the App Store app on your iOS device.\nClick on the Updates button in the lower right corner to advance to the Updates pane:\n\nClick in the Purchased area near the top of the screen to advance to the Purchased pane:\n\nSelect the Not on this iDevice tab to see purchased apps that aren't currently installed:\n\nSelect the app you're looking for from the list and install it.\n\nA: When I get to the \"Not on this iPod\" folder, the app (instagram) I am looking for has an action button that is greyed out. iPod Touch 4th Generation. I have tried to sync via cable with iTunes and no change. I have tried to remove the app from our iTunes and re-sync and also no change. \nBackground: My niece plugged her iPhone into our iMac a long time ago and some of her apps are on our iTunes and they load to our devices. Instagram was one the apps. \nThis would seem related to the problem. Unless Instagram is not able to run on an iPod Touch. \n\nA: Search for it on your phone using Spotlight. As mentioned in the comments, it may be on an invisible home screen. If that doesn't work, you can try using iTunes to sync it over, or at least to help you find it. \nIf you'r absolutely convinced that it's not actually installed, you can try using a utility to muck around with system files. (Particularly, the SpringBoard property-list files, which may contain info that the App Store is using, although honestly, I doubt that doing so would work.)\n\nA: Have you tried searching for the application on your device? If you have enough applications installed, some of them may not be shown on the home screen. You can search by swiping to the left from your first page of apps.\n\n\nYou can also check iTunes to see if the app is installed, and uninstall it there:\n\n", "Q: How accurate are iOS apps that measure heart rate? There are apps like Instant Heart Rate and Cardiograph which claim to be able to measure heart rate by reading color changes on arterial pressure change. They generally require you to place your finger over the flash led and camera.\nFrom my tests the values don't quite match rates measured traditionally (by feeling arterial pressure changes, counting them over 10 seconds and multiplying by 6) but I'm not a physician so I might be measuring incorrectly.\nSo, are these apps more precise than I can be or is it the other way around?\n\nA: I suspected that apps which rely on the flashlight and camera weren't more precise than a manual check (assuming you are used to checking your BPM regularly). Event if they rely on a technique used by medical apparatus (photoplethysmography).\nBut then I did some testing.\nTesting\nvs myself\nComparing with my own readings the results seem to be consistent with a ~5 BPM margin based on the approximation due to the multiplication. I actually am less precise than these apps.\n2 different iPhones models with flash\nThe results of some testing using 2 different iPhone models, the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S shows that on 6 readings (3 per device), I had a difference of 2 to 0 bpm with less than ideal conditions.\nvs a Gamin Forerunner\nTesting of one of the apps agains a GPS sports watch with BPM Showed very close results on a dozen readings. A 3 BPM difference was be the least precise it would get in when testing in good conditions, most of the time they are off by 1 or 2.\nConclusion\nConvenient and precise\nIf you don't press hard on the camera (to avoid blocking blood flow), remain calm, not moving and there are no strong variations in lighting around you you should get a decent reading without having to concentrate on feeling the blood flow and counting the heart beats.\nhistory\nApart from the convenience, I believe the real advantage of these apps is the tracking and history of your bpm.\nIf you want to use these apps before and after exercising they will be enough. Based on my tests, the accuracy seems very good (better than I believed) if you make sure to place your finger properly, covering the camera without pressing hard as not to stop the blood flow (again this is important).\nI think I will trust the iPhone from now on ;)\nHow To\nTo properly monitor your heart rate with the iPhone you must:\n\n*\n\n*avoid testing in a place where there are high light variations\n\n*cover the camera and the flashlight with your finger\n\n*keep your finger from moving around (to avoid making the camera refocus)\n\n*press only very lightly to properly cover the camera (if you press too hard you will reduce the blood flow and it will be impossible to read the pulse)\n\n\nAs a side note. If you want a really good way of keeping track of your bpm and blood pressure this product works great on the iPhone/iPad.\n\nA: I have just tried an app claiming to do this and compared it to my Garmin HRM and a manual test and the figures shown on the app are in line with the other tests.\nAs for inanimate having a heart beat what I believe the app does is increase its sensitivity looking for a regular pulse(change in the image). Once the sensitivity goes high enough it appears to pick up background vibrations causing tiny movements in relation to the object being measured. The changes in the finger are much larger and will therefore be picked up more readily and background vibration becomes insignificant. Therefore I conclude that the claim that it is inaccurate because inanimate objects have a pulse is irrelevant.\nFor a quick check of heart rate such as for resting heart rate in the mornings then these apps seem good enough\n\nA: Very interesting question! I wasn't even aware that these kind of apps exist. In order to answer your question, I decided to put one of them to the test against a chest strap heart rate monitor. (I was using a Garmin brand chest monitor similar to this one.) I was using both heart rate monitors at the same time when I performed my tests and compared their values.\nI tried out Instant Heart Rate Monitor, and it turns out that it is remarkably accurate... when it worked.\nThe main problem was that it only worked about 1 in 30 times. Every other time it would say it could either not detect a finger, or it started detecting the pulse, but then never finished the process.\nWhen it did work, though, the results were surprisingly similar to my other heart rate monitor. After performing 5 (non-scientific) tests, it was off by an average of only 1.26%. Had it worked more consistently, I would have tried it out more than 5 times.\nA few notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*While it is beeping and gathering info, the heart rate it shows is usually way off from your actual heart rate. Sometimes it's almost exactly half your real heart rate.\n\n*The final heart rate it outputs is usually very close to your actual heart rate.\n\n\nTherefore, you should only trust the last heart rate value it outputs (i.e. the average).\n\nA: The operative term here is photoplethysmograph. It's the term for what your phone is acting as. \nBasically, your blood vessels rhythmically dilate and contract with every heart beat. This is measurable as either a change in reflectance or transmittance (depending on how the photoplethysmograph is configured. In the case of your phone, it's measuring reflectance, as the light is adjacent to the camera.\nIn medical instruments, it's generally done with infrared light, because blood absorbs shortwave infrared more then red or white light, and your tissue is more transparent to infrared. However, there is no reason it wouldn't work with a phone camera.\nIf done properly, it should be as or more accurate then manual measurement. However, a phone is not a proper photoplethysmograph, so the realistic achievable accuracy is likely dependent on a number of factors, including camera performance, proximity of the illuminating LED to the camera lens, and the algorithm used to extract the pulse from the video return. \nHowever, you need to be aware that all photoplethysmographs are very sensitive to mechanical movement. It is essential that you hold your finger as still as possible, and avoid moving the phone relative to the finger.\n\nA: In some senses, the accuracy might be no better than if they had you tap out the pulses with one finger and using your other hand to palpate an easy to find artery like your carotid artery. Also note, for exercise, new low energy bluetooth 4.0 accessories are far superior hardware for detecting and reporting heart rate as well as blood pressure.\nThere are several technologies for measuring cardiac activity:\n\n\n*\n\n*pulse detection - measures the periods of maximal flow rate from the left ventricle output.\n\n*blood pressure - measures the volume/flow of fluid in your arteries due to the pumping action of the left ventricle.\n\n*two lead pulse detection - measures electrical changes at the surface of the skin on the chest\n\n*12 lead ECG/EKG - determines actual heard muscle activity in different chambers of the heart by comparing the timing and amplitude of electrical signals from the surface of the skin from multiple measurement sites carefully positioned around your torso.\n\n\nWith the right filtering of the camera input, The motion of your finger (side to side as well as pressing harder or less hard) is pretty easily distinguishable by the camera when all the algorithm needs to do is tell when fresh blood is washing into your fingertips. By the time the blood gets to the extremity - the pulse is less strong so this is one of the worst areas to try to detect pulses (but it's very convenient and the skin is fairly translucent to the LED flash and oxygenated blood does reflect the light so it does work fairly well in some body types).\nI like the wahoo fitness blue heart rate belt and especially the Mio Link wrist band, so the market for hardware custom designed for this should overtake any software that runs on iOS directly and uses the camera for measurement. For a quick read on your pulse, these camera apps should be decent enough to get that job done. Apple watch also is a nice alternative to using your iPhone camera to record pulse data.\n\nA: Unless for some reason you are not able to count the pulse beats, these apps are never more precise than standard manual check.\nThe way they work is when you put you finger on the led light and the camera they monitor colour changes of your skin. Your skin colour changes rhythmically as the blood is pumped through veins. This could be a fairly accurate method, but requires very strict behaviour of the person who is being checked. Any move of an arm, hand, or a finger can, and most likely will skew the result.\nI believe both apps say, the results provided are not definitive and cannot be used as a source for medical diagnosis.\nSo, to sum up - they're almost never as accurate as the standard manual check.\n\nA: There is no way any built in camera in mobile devices has the accuracy to detect the kind of changes these applications claims to use to detect pulse from your skin. I don´t need to hear all of you claiming it´s +-2, 3 or 5 bpm precise, to put it simply: cameras aren´t that evolved, it´s a hardware limitation! \nYou can check it just by pointing the camera to any inanimate object to see what the app says it´s heart beat is...\nOf course it´s not magic, this app is just playing dices in the inside while painting funny stuff on screen.\n\nA: I have downloaded several apps to calculate my pulse I have a very high one anyways but they all came out the same except one said they could not calculate cause it is to high 99bmp\n", "Q: How do I mark songs as Explicit in iTunes to make them match correctly in iTunes Match I have a few CD's that I ripped a while ago that are in my iTunes library, that have an explicit label. They play fine on my local computer. \nThe problem is, these ripped CDs are not marked as explicit in my iTunes library, so due to a bug in iTunes Match, when I play these songs on other devices, they play the clean versions 'Matched' from iTunes Match. Imagine my surprise when I'm listening to a song I expect to have explicit lyrics all of a sudden clean. \nI know that there is a metadata 'flag' somewhere in the file that sets this, and its not available through the iTunes interface. I have seen online that there are tools to edit this flag, but then either hear that it doesn't actually do this, no real decent walk-throughs, or even discrepancies on which field to edit. What do I need, and how do I mark these songs as explicit to then get matched 'correctly' in iTunes Match?\nUpdate: The answer from gentmatt does let me set the Explicit flag on the files as I was hoping to do. I thought this would solve the problem, but it does not. Also, I noticed that various other albums, with explicit lyrics, do actually sync correctly. The only problem albums I have are a Kanye West album, and a Jay-Z album. But with this question being related more towards how do I get them to work correctly in iTunes Match, im continuing to look for answers.\nFinal Update: This was an issue with  iTunes Match. After a while, I tried downloading them again, and it pulled the right ones. There were several albums that reported this way, and they are continuously working on it. So it was less of an issue with my actual files, and more of an issue of how the files were indexed on the iTunes Match server side.\n\nA: Subler\n...allows to edit (almost?) any metadata to a song manually.\nYou can use this tool add the explicit label to a song.\nI've successfully tested version 0.14 in Lion.\n\n\n\nA: I sent an email to iTunes store support. This is what they said:\n\nI understand that iTunes Match is providing the clean versions of certain explicit songs. I imagine that you are eager to enjoy the original content. I am happy to look into this for you.\nThis is a known issue that Apple's engineers are currently investigating. At this time, I don't have an estimate as to when the issue will be resolved.\nI've added five credits to your account. Each credit can be used for one song. When you sign in to the iTunes Store with this account, the credits will appear in the upper-right corner by your account name. The next time you buy songs from the iTunes Store, your credits will be used as payment until all credits have been used or have expired.\n\nSo looks like there's nothing we can do for now. If you email them they'll give you five free songs to make up for it.

The button mappings are detailed in their wiki.\nWith Plex installed and running you can access all your media, navigate on a TV-friendly UI using your Apple Remote and use plugins like their Netflix plugin to access streaming content all from one slick interface.\nYou can download the Plex apps for your iOS and Andriod devices and use it to connect your mobile computers back to your Mac-located content and stream it over the air.\n\nA: I'd vote for the wonderful XBMC:  http://xbmc.org/download/\nI love it:\nit's free\nit's beautiful and it can change its look easily with themes\nit has a lot of custom functions that can be easily added as plugins or widgets: from weather forecasts to rss downloaders, youtube (with video downloads) and more and more\nit has an app to use your phone as its remote controller (or any other kind of remote I have in my house - mostly irda)\nit has automatic retrieval of art, scrapers, plots, actors names, genres and so on from the internet\nit has automatic download of subtitles for films and series\n...\nwould you ask anything more? :)\n\nA: I would recommend the following setup (which is what I currently use):\nPlex\nUse Plex as your remote-control-friendly home theatre hub. I find Plex to be much easier to set up than XBMC, but where I think Plex really shines is in how easy it is to share your mini's media with other devices.\nOn your mini you install both the Plex Media Server and Plex Media Center apps. If you want to stream to additional Macs or PCs, you can install just the Media Center on those.\nOn your iOS devices, you can install Plex Mobile to stream your mini's media to the device. Plex Mobile can also be used as a remote control for Plex.\nYou can add your iTunes Media folders to Plex to access your iTunes songs and videos, however neither Plex nor XBMC can play DRM videos purchased from iTunes.\nHulu Desktop\nHulu Desktop is a remote-control-friendly app for browsing and watching Hulu videos. Best of all, you can launch Hulu Desktop directly from Plex.\nHippoRemote\nHippoRemote is a remote control app with better integration with various media players than Mobile Mouse (formerly Air Mouse) and Plex Mobile. Plex Mobile only works with Plex, Mobile Mouse works with most things except Plex. HippoRemote works with Plex, Hulu Desktop, and just about everything else, and it even works with the Netflix player.\nHippoRemote also has much smoother mouse tracking than Mobile Mouse.\nApple Remote\nThe Apple Remote is certainly easier to just pick up and use than using than any remote app, so it can be handy to have it close by for quickly navigating Plex and Hulu Desktop on a whim.\nLogitech Harmony Remotes\nI actually don't have one of these yet, but I know several people that love Logitech's Harmony remotes. If want a remote that will also control your TV and receiver, these would definitely be worth checking out.\n\nA: You could use Hulu Desktop in conjunction with Mobile Mouse ($2), which has a dedicated layout for Hulu Desktop that looks similar to the iTunes layout:\n\nThis only works for Hulu though.\n\nA: I use TouchPad its £2.99\nThis app allows the user to control a Mac from an iOS device. You can use it as an extension to keyboard and mouse as well as an Apple Remote, and a media player controller.\nBelow you can see images of its functions, This is the TrackPad/Mouse and Keyboard\n\nThe image below shows the remote function on the iPhone\n\nHere you can see the iPad version and can see the different media players it is compatabile with.\n\n\nA: I have used both XBMC and Plex (http://www.plexapp.com/).  I found that the Plex software is far easier to install, and it can be used with external remotes (even the Apple Remote).\nAlso, I like the fact that there are Plugins that you can use.\n\nA: We suggest nessMediaCenter (http://www.nessmediacenter.com).\nIt is like FrontRow designed to use the Mac system features - that way it is small (8 MB) and needs less system power.\nThe hight contrast (white on black) and large font size allows it to recognize the content better than in other media centers. Background / foreground color and font size (aka how many entries are shown) can be setup in the preferences.\nThe media center offers internet content, iPhoto & iTunes media, Miro video podcasts and local media (picture / movie folder and volumes).\nThe local media can be accessed without adding it to a separate library - local media is organized as the Finder's folder structure.\nFor DVDs a preview will be searched automatically - thru \"Movie Info\" a preview and description can be set for DVDs and videos / movies.\nThe \"Movie Info\" also allows it to save all movie informations as HTML page to share these informations with your friends.\nSupported media: pictures, videos / movies, PDFs, DVDs, EyeTV movies.\nBy installing the QuickTime extension \"Perian\", all common video formats are playable (AVI, DivX, MKV etc.).\nProtected iTunes media (DRM) will be started in iTunes, EyeTV movies in EyeTV or VLC (if EyeTV is not available).\nIt can be controlled by Apple remote control, \"NV Remote App\" for iOS (http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/nv-remote/id389343735) or keyboard.\nWith \"NV Remote App\" and the iTunes control of the media center, the music can be controlled within the local WLAN. In landscape mode the app will show the current selection - very helpful if one is sitting e.g. in the kitchen and want to change the playlist.\nnessMediaCenter can be used as demo for 30 minutes after each launch. The full versions costs 9.50 Euro.\n(This is a promotion - my company \"FINESS UG\" is selling nessMediaCenter.)\n", "Q: How to pass the endless verifying status on iMessage or FaceTime activation when phone number is wrong?

From that point my network settings went bad and I experienced numerous issues (visual voicemail, FaceTime and internet access were not working properly or at all).\nTo solve the problem I had to restore the iPhone and then setup the iPhone as a new iPhone.

I have a few leads, but wanted to know what people feel is an excellent stock price data-visualization and data-exploration app on a retina iPad display.\nExcellent would include:\n\n\n*\n\n*very clear data with multitouch features for zooming, selecting price points or data ranges.\n\n*more native iOS features than simply a web view app (unless that web view stands on equal ground with a native stock app)\n\n*is equal to or better than the iPhone stock app in terms of features, polish, ease of use and data viewing function.\n\n*some basic import / export capabilities for portfolio management (extra credit - not mandatory)\n\n*simple averages and overlays to see trends and not just the open/close/range volume data (extra credit)\n\n*no ads or the option to pay money to avoid advertisements on the screen \n\n\nExcellent doesn't necessarily mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*Real-time data feed (although a solution that required a lot of steps to refresh the data on a daily basis would be far less useful than an app that could tap into a feed of data that was market delayed.)\n\n*derivative and super complicated analysis lines that are more appropriate for professional trading software (and I would expect to cost hundreds of dollars)\n\n*portfolio management\n\n*actual trading - I'm looking for historical data - not a platform for executing trades. Don't rule out a trading app if it otherwise meets the requirements and is open to anyone with a reasonably low bar to entry (like opening an account with $50 or such)\n\n\nIt doesn't matter if you need to buy the app or if it has an optional or mandatory data service that feeds the data (but please call that out if makes or breaks the app).\n\nA: I know that AllMyShares is highly regarded (one of the developers attends my CocoaHeads group in Melbourne) and I've confirmed they are planning a retina display update. If you like it, it might be worth adopting this one.\nHere's the website for an overview, lots of videos, screenshots etc.\n\nA: The one app that seems closest to my criteria at the moment is MarketDash by Yahoo.\nIt does have some retina optimization, but the graphics of stock price itself are somewhat chunky and not as nice as I would like.\nIt has some multitouch gestures, but the app feels laggy and slow much of the time. Simple swipes work well, but pinch and zoom not so much.\nIt has ads that I would rather pay to get rid of, but cannot see an option for that presently.\nIf you don't mind sharing your stock symbols with yahoo - it allows you to load a portfolio from their finance web site, so that is quite nice. You also can set up a portfolio on the device.\nOverall the design is quite nice with dark gradients, tasteful color scheme and all the expected things like \"links to news articles for the companies you  have selected\". Unfortunately, most of those links direct you to spas screens asking you to install other iPad apps, rather than the content. Once you navigate the slash screen promos - the sites it links to are ad heavy and not as useful as mobile news sites like the NYTimes or Wall Street Journal.\nThis is the best app I have found, but it's only good in comparison to the rest. I wouldn't recommend it highly for making good use of the retina display. It is free and obviously intended to drive traffic to yahoo and it's partner sites and does serve up accurate, timely stock data on the iPad.\n\nA: When it comes to nice looking Data visualisation, I think you should have a look at Roambi Analytics Visualizer, even if I´m not sure if it fulfils all your wishes.\n", "Q: How to seamlessly sync contacts and calendars across devices? I currently have all my contacts and calendars on my Mac, but would like to sync them over the air with my other devices (iPod, iPad and Android phone). I also want it to be multidirectional: being able to add, edit or delete from all devices. \nAs far as I understood from reading other threads, the best bet is to keep all calendars and contacts on Google and sync them with the other devices. This means not using iCloud to sync calendars or contacts.\nIs this correct? Do I really have to move all my contacts and calendars to Google Contacts and Google Calendar in order to have them synced across all devices? Will I be able to add contacts or edit calendars from any device and have them in sync as well?\n\nA: Yes, the best way to sync cross platform is via google.\nBy far the easiest most care free way to sync all contacts, calendars, email etc is to have all Apple devices, this is how Apple meant for this service to be used.\nGoogle has done a good job of making this service available to people working on multiple platforms.\n\nA: Use Google Sync. You can set up Exchange on your iOS devices, and for Android there are instructions available per version.\nI’ve been using this solution for years on my Mac and iPhone, and it works really well. I haven’t tested how this works on Android, but I can only assume Google would do anything in their power to make it work correctly on their own smartphone :)\n\nA: The key is your Android phone.\nIf you want to sync with it, you cannot easily use iCloud.  However the choice of using Google for everything just to make the android device happy may well be of scant benefit when you consider the fact that you are missing out on the iCloud stuff which is a better fit for the majority of your devices.\nYour call, but consider you are compromising every device for the sake of your android phone, and forcing google on everything for its sake.  It would have to be my primary device for it to make me do this.\ninstead, I would look into using iCloud for everything, and using the many and various fudges for getting devices that don't officially work with iCloud to make your Android phone use it.  Technically the iPhone 3G does not support iCloud, but that doesn't mean that with a bit of studious messing about manually configuring caldav settings you cannot get it to work, and I see no reason why your android phone should be any different.\n\nA: For cross-platform contact sync, IntouchApp is the best option today. It works on Android, iPhone, Blackberry, Blackberry10 and Java phones. A single contact list is created in the cloud that is available on all your devices. The app is also easy to install and use. http://intouchapp.com\n\nA: I got my samsung Note 2 to sync contacts messages and calenders seamlessly from my iphone  4 using an android app called easy phone sync. Youll need to download and install it on your Mac 1st then do the same on your android phone. Then launch it on the mac it invokes itunes then plug your android phone to your mac and it syncs from your itunes back up. Make sure you have deselected encrypted backup from the iTunes options. This app cant read an encrypted itunes back up. It wil sync. It also syncs google gmail contacts and linkedin contacts and formats them real well. The calender is a bit messy too busy with details. Still trying to work it out.\n", "Q: Logitech C615 web cam sound control I have a Logitech C615 web cam with a built-in microphone.

Basically what was happening is that I was trying to navigate through the on-screen menu on the AppleTV, but instead the input was affecting playback in iTunes.  Note, though I do have AirPlay enabled, iTunes was not streaming to the AppleTV at the time.\nIs this expected behavior, and if so, what must I do to prevent it?\n\nA: This is because they both use similar technology. You need to pair the remote with the device you wish to use it on if you have multiple devices. \nYou can do this on the Apple TV by:\n\n\n*\n\n*going to Settings\n\n*General \n\n*Remotes \n\n*Pair Remote\n\n\nMore info is available in the Setup Guide as well.\nIf you want to pair it with the Mac, you can do the following steps (From an Apple KB):\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in on your Mac as an Admin user.\n\n*Get very close to your Mac (about 3 or 4 inches away).\n\n*Point the remote at the infrared sensor on the front of your Mac.\n\n*Press and hold the Menu and Next/Fast-forward buttons simultaneously on the remote for 5 seconds.\n\n*Your Apple Remote is now paired with your computer. You should see a chain-link style lock appear in the center of your screen for a moment.\n\n\nIf you never want the Mac to be controled with the remote, then you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Go to Security \n\n*Select  \"Disable remote control infrared receiver\"\n\n", "Q: Can I globally change the cmd-Q shortcut to require holding for two seconds, like the option in Chrome? Many, many times, I accidentally press ⌘+Q when I meant to close a tab or window, or switch applications. When I saw the option in Google Chrome to require the shortcut to be held, I was overjoyed. Problem is, I use Safari.\nSo, in short: How can I make the \"hold command-Q\" shortcut universal across all of my applications (or at least Safari)?\n\nA: Another option is to use Karabiner with the following XML:\n__HoldingKeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_NONE, KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND, Option::NOREPEAT\n\n\nA: CommandQ ($4.00) does exactly this. It's very customizable and has a nice GUI, though I haven't used it personally. It seems to fulfil the requirements of this question.\n\nA: Here's a partial solution for starters:\nPreventing accidental quitting in Safari (or any specific application)\nSimply set up an unusual keyboard shortcut for the \"Quit Safari\" menu item in Keyboard preferences.\nThis will disable the standard ⌘Q shortcut, so accidentally hitting it doesn't make a difference — and you have to think before you quit!\n\n\n(Unfortunately, I haven't found an easy way to do this for every application, without entering each one manually.)\n\nA: Continuing on jtbandes' solution, once you have remapped the standard Quit command to a different keystroke (yes, sadly, you need to remap it manually for every application you are worried about accidentally quitting), you can create a service in Automator that takes no input. It should have a single action: Run AppleScript. The script is:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set theName to name of the first process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\ntell application theName\n    display dialog \"Are you sure you want to quit?\"\n    quit\nend tell\n\nYou then save that service (I called mine \"SafeSave\"), and assign the service the keystroke ⌘Q. You have thus reclaimed the standard keystroke.\n\nA: Douglas Teoh has made an app called SlowQuitApps, that does exactly this.\n\nAn OS X app that adds a global delay of 1 second to the Cmd-Q\n  shortcut. In other words, you have to hold down Cmd-Q for 1 second\n  before an application will quit.\nWhen the delay is active, an overlay is drawn at the center of the\n  screen.\n\n\nA: I don't believe that's possible.\n", "Q: How can I restore an iPad to factory defaults? I'm planning to sell / give my old iPad to a friend.  I've already saved everything that I want off of the old iPad.  How can I restore the old iPad to factory default settings so that my friend can start fresh?\nIt's a first-gen iPad, in case it matters.\n\nA: In iPad Settings, go to General, then Transfer or Reset, then \"Erase All Contents and Settings\". The next thing you see ( after confirmation) is the welcome screen as if just out of the box.\nAlso: If shipping it you might want to power off by holding top and bottom buttons until you see the \"slide to power off\" slider. I recently sold my iPad 2, cleared it to factory settings as described and powered off. Happy new owner received it with charge, ready to configure.\nLate note:\nIf FindMy is enabled, you must disable this first [meaning you must have access to its iCloud account] or the new owner will not be able to use it, it will still be locked to you.\n", "Q: How can I send an email to a google contact group on my iOS devices? I have groups in my Google Contacts for sending emails to sets of people via the web interface on a browser.\nI sync Google mail and contacts onto a couple iOS devices via Microsoft Exchange.\nHow can I send an email to a google group from iOS? Neither the built in mail/contact apps have any reference to my groups, and I cannot acces them via the web browser (mobile version), nor the official gmail app (which seems to be a resigned web interface). \n\nA: Unfortunately, there's not a way of doing it with the native iOS app. Try using the Gmail app (which I personally prefer). If not, there's this little workaround: http://red66.com/2009/07/how-to-send-group-emails-from-your-iphone/\nThe gist of the workaround is to make one contact for the group and add a comma separated list of emails to the singular email field for the \"group contact\"\nThis doesn't allow you to leverage arbitrary groups and does require some manual setup, but once that's done you can email limited group sizes from iOS without needing a computer.\n\nA: I use Google Chrome on iOS.\nGo to google.com/contacts and choose \"Request Desktop Site\" from the top right icon (three horizontal lines).\nSelect your group from the left and click the empty square above the list to select all members.  It will then open a new message in Gmail to all the recipients.\nI've tested this on my iPad, running iOS 6\n\nA: Actually it is possible, I just went into my sent mail where I've emailed 34 people from my desktop, I clicked forward email, which will display all of the emails, I selected all, copied.

Go to gmail app in apple os ipad, click compose, click plus sign, select name in contacts where group emails were added, and click send once email is ready. It sent. I know it did because I received 13 out of office replies. I did get a message that said invalid email, send anyway? I selected send and it sent to everyone\n\nA: I would suggest the app \"ContactSync\" to turn your Google Groups into mail groups for the ios mail. \n\nA: I run a list (upwards of 300 names) and have been stymied by this as well when needing to send an email on the run (\"Hey--we're still playing disc today...\")\nMy work around is to save a draft letter (from the web app) with the BCC filled in with my group members.

I saw a super deal where I could get an iPhone 4 8GB for such a small amount that I couldn't resist.\nDoes someone know if it's possible to change the flash storage for a 16GB or 32GB ?\nWould iTunes recognize the device and/or enable me to reset it to default iOS and settings ?\n\nA: The flash memory is a BGA surface mount package, and is not something you could manage even if you were proficient with a soldering iron.  A hot air reflow workstation would be required, along with a few other specialized tools for working with replacement and repair of BGA devices.\nEven if you made the change, it's possible it wouldn't be recognized by the device, and if they are storing configuration information in the flash you may need to get a copy of someone else's 64GB flash to be successful.\nIt's something very few electronics professionals would attempt, and it would certainly cost them more than $200 in time and effort, assuming they already had the tools to perform the work.\n\nA: No there is not hard drive nor a removable SSD or even a removable flash drive. It is all integrated into the circuit board as noted in iFixit's teardown for the iPhone 4. However it is possible to swap the entire board out, but that would probably not be practical unless you could get one for cheap.\nAs noted on iFixit, the largest chip pictured below with Samsung written on it is the flash storage for the iPhone.\n\n\nA: No, it is flash memory soldered onto the main circuit board and cannot be changed. It is not similar to devices with removable/upgradeable storage at all. \nIn this case \"no user-serviceable parts inside\" would be pretty close to the truth. iFixit has a great iPhone 4S tear down if you'd like a complete tour of the internals.

The home button is no sensor in the meaning of a pressure sensor.\nFor reference see this.\n\nA: The home button is a mechanical button.  It can get gunged up over time like any other button, and one seemingly useful remedy for enabling freer movement like it was when you bought it is to apply a tiny amount of WD40 down the side of the button and rapidly press it lots whilst rotating the phone around on a level ish plane.\n\nA: Whilst reading this thread I literally put my mouth over the button and sucked and it's suddenly fine.\n\nA: I read it somewhere too, but I guess doing a soft reset will help in resetting home button sensitivity.\n\"To reset iPhone, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the same time for at least 10 seconds, until the Apple logo appears.\"\nNothing is lost during a soft reset.\n", "Q: How does the new iPad's Retina Display affect its battery life? As we all know, the new iPad has a gorgeous new Retina Display. And yet, it's advertised to have battery life just as good as the iPad 2's.\nHow is this possible? Doesn't the new display require a lot more power to run? Were any performance tradeoffs made (e.g. refresh rate), or did Apple improve the battery enough that it's irrelevant?\n\n\nA: Your question's wording is a bit unluckily.\nThere is no previous iPad with the same battery capacity. It does not really makes sense to talk of an impact of a new display to the battery-life. That's not a reasonable comparison because the battery has been updated as well.\nThe retina display of the iPad 3rd generation\n\nThe new iPad uses 2.5 times the backlight power of the iPad 2. This is due to the TFT transistors of the high-res LCD display blocking more light. (source)\n\nThis also contributes to the heat emission. The overall performance however is only little affected, because Apple compensated the increased power drain by adding a 70% bigger battery.\n\n\n(pictures 1,2)\n\nA: Battery life is marginally improved overall.  Basically it's a bigger battery.  The extra power required by the higher quality screen, along with the GPU that is needed to power it is more than made up for by increasing the battery capacity by approximately 70%.\nRumours that the iPad 4 will include Fuel Cell batteries with a 14 year lifecycle that takes 3 years to charge are thus far unfounded.\nSee this interesting article for more info\nexcerpt follows:\n\nBecause of the increased battery draw of the MDM9600 and Retina display, Apple had to significantly increase the iPad's battery capacity. The original iPad had a 24.8Whr battery, and Apple increased that slightly to 25Whr in the iPad 2 while shaving off nearly 5mm of thickness. Though the iPad 3 is just 0.6mm thicker than the iPad 2, it boasts a 42.5Whr battery—an impressive 70 percent capacity improvement.\nThe revised three-cell design appears to be slightly larger than the battery in the iPad 2—each measures about 125 x 65 x 4 mm, according to iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens. The cells in the iPad 2 measure 108 x 63 x 2.7mm, so the iPad 3 battery is actually about 70 percent larger. Earlier speculation suggested that Apple had somehow significantly improved on the power density of the cells, but our calculations show otherwise. Apple was just able to more efficiently pack in the components—and increase the overall device thickness ever so slightly—to make the battery larger.\n", "Q: Is there a way to have iOS remember passwords to HTTP authenticated sites? There's a page I frequently access on my iPhone that's protected by HTTP authentication, and I'm finding it annoying having to type in my username and password every time I want to access it. I tried saving the logged-in page as a home screen icon, but I'm still prompted every time. There isn't option to save my password when I'm logging in, and I can't find one in the settings either.\nIs this possible?\n\nexample authentication screen to show what I'm referring to\n\nA: I just had to do this on the latest version of iOS as of this date, 10.1.1. I also had to make a shortcut on the home screen. Problem was, putting the username:password in the URL wouldn't work because Safari would immediately remove the username:password from the URL, so I couldn't capture the fully-formed URL in a home screen shortcut.\nI made a web page that redirected (JavaScript) to the fully-formed target URL (e.g., http://user:pass@hostname). I navigated to it in Safari, and Safari preserved the fully-formed URL for some reason. From there I made a home screen shortcut.\n\nA: You can do this with the app 1Password. You just have to use the browser inside of the app. \nCreate a login in the app with the appropriate URL, username and password. \n\nA: It seems that Safari on iOS doesn't support this natively. You have a couple options:\nWorkaround:\nIf you're not too worried about security, you can embed the username and password in the link itself, and bookmark that:\nhttp://username:password@hostname.com/...\n\n(Also of note: it sounds like iOS may pop up a warning when you visit a link that includes a username and password.)\nAlternative:\nThere is another browser called Atomic Web Browser [App Store link] that can autofill HTTP authentication, among many other neat features.\n\nA: Mercury browser will also save Basic Authentication on iOS and is a free download.\nhttp://mercury-browser.com\nBe sure to finish typing and then press \"Save\" before logging in. You may have to do it a couple times for different parts of the site.\n\nA: While I haven't managed to make Mobile Safari prefill the dialogue, you can manually add the credentials via the Accounts & Passwords section in Settings. There's an 'Add password' button at the bottom of the list (search for something to make it shorter).\nThen, next time you get presented with the dialogue you can tap the key icon in the autocomplete bar and search for the credential and have it fill in the dialogue fields for you. Not perfect, but better than nothing.\nN.B. I did also try moving the creds from my login keychain on my Mac to the iCloud one, so that it would sync across, but it wouldn't show up on my iOS device. \n\nA: In iOS 15, Settings > Passwords allows adding new entries by hand. You can fill in the website URL and the credentials here. The next time the basic auth dialog shows up, it will not, unfortunately, be pre-filled, but you will be presented with the Passwords button in your on-screen keyboards once you focus either of the username / password fields and from there you can pick the credentials. It's not completely straight-forward, but it is the best option I found, especially because some websites do not support reading the username and password from the URL, only from the HTTP header, so the trick with the bookmark with the credentials in it doesn't work everywhere.\n", "Q: Analyzing the iPhone's moisture sensor Every time I'm near a Genius Bar I see a lot of ENT (ear, nose, throat) microscopes peering down the headphone jack of various iPhones. I asked about it and found that the moisture sensor is down there, and if your device got wet then it turns red, and the purpose of that is that you don't have a warranty and don't get a free new device if it has mysteriously died but the cause is moisture.\nI'm curious about how these things work and whether this simple examination could be subverted. I don't have a wet iPhone and I'm not looking to defraud Apple here, but I'm curious.\n\n\n*\n\n*The sensor must involve a chemical reaction, if it didn't show the indicator color when it dried it wouldn't be much good. What is the reaction and is it reversible? Would the required reagent be safe to drip down the headphone opening?\n\n*Could one buy a new sensor component, open the phone and replace it?\n\n*How about simply getting a material that looks like the sensor, opening the phone and putting it in place of the sensor - an inert sensor?\n\n*Simplest of all, painting the sensor - if the \"OK\" color is white then a paint marker should do.\n\n\nAgain, not trying to get a free phone here. I'm curious about devices like this since I saw my first \"tip-n-tell\" on a shipping carton, and played with Maxim iButton temperature loggers.\n\nA: An inert \"sensor\" would be white paper.\nAn actually working sensor could be paper coated with cobalt(II) chloride, whose hexa hydrate (cobalt chloride \"containing\" water) turns light red.\nIf you want to tamper with the original sensor, think of water free clear coat.\n", "Q: Macbook Air iPhoto does not see albums on the iPad I have a number of photo albums on my iPad.

I can't sync my photos because it was synced with another device previously and I don't want my photos on my iPad to be deleted. I need to get the photos onto my mac first before I sync.\n\n*When I had a PC I could simply go to the iPad and select the photos and copy and paste them. I cannot find any place on the mac where I can browse the photos on the iPad?\nAm I missing something? \nPlease help. I am starting to thing I made a huge mistake getting the macbook air.\n\nA: You could use a 3rd-party app such as the free WiFi Photo Transfer to access all those pictures on your MacBook Air. It uses a web browser to access the photos, so you don't have to install any software on the MacBook Air or deal with syncing.\nThe whole process is easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the app on the iPhone or iPad\n\n*On your computer, you type in the address it tells you to in a browser.\n\n*You can then choose to either download a specific picture or entire albums.\n\n\n\nAnother benefit is that none of the pictures are sent to the Internet.\n\nA: Use iPhoto for iOS\nYou could download iPhoto for iOS, this will sync all your iPad's photos to iPhoto on your Mac.\n\nUse iCloud\nThis can also be done by enabling iCloud's Photo stream on both your iPad Settings>iCloud>photo stream - turn that on. (Obviously only if you have an iCloud account)\n\nThen on your MacBook go to System Prefrences>iCloud>photo stream.\n\nThese settings will enable photo syncing between your devices over the cloud.\n", "Q: Run AppleScript after waking from Sleep? Is there an easy way to run an AppleScript or application immediately (or a brief delay of X seconds) after waking up from sleep?\nI'm looking for a solution that doesn't involve a 3rd-party app.\n\nA: Yes indeed there is, and it is detailed in this, the Dragon Systems Software UK blog.\nI do not believe it is possible without using some external software. The kernel notifies apps that register for registerSleepWakeInterest events, and AppleScript seems not to include the ability to register for this notification.\nThere's a code sample given in Apple's Kernel Programming Guide.\nBernard Baehr has even made source code for his application, SleepWatcher, available. \n", "Q: iOS Camera Roll and Photo Stream workflow When I take a photo on my iPhone it is added to both the Camera Roll and Photo Stream.  I can then upload the photo into \"permanent\" storage in Mac iPhoto either from Photo Stream or Camera Roll (during a sync).\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any difference in the photo stored in Camera Roll or Photo Stream?\n\n*Photo Stream automatically reduces the resolution when it transfers a photo to an iOS device.  Does this down resolution process only apply to photos transferred to a different iOS device, i.e. a photo taken on the iPhone is full resolution on the original iPhone but would be down sampled if Photo Stream transferred it to a different iPhone?\n\n*Is there any easy way to delete multiple photos from Camera Roll and Photo Stream on an iOS device?  One at a time isn't exactly practical for the hundreds of photos I might take on a long trip.\n\nA: *\n\n*A photo stored in the Camera Roll is permanently stored on your device (until you delete it). Only 1,000 photos are saved in the Photo Stream on an iOS device, so if enough photos are uploaded to your Photo Stream the old ones will be purged. (But a Mac or PC will save all of the photos in your Photo Stream by default.)\n\n\n*According to Apple, the downscaling does only apply on iOS devices — if you have Photo Stream set up on your computer, those photos will be full-resolution.\n\nOn your Mac or PC, your photos are downloaded and stored in full resolution. On your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV, your Photo Stream photos are delivered in a device-optimized resolution that speeds downloads and saves storage space.\n\n\n\n*Yes — to delete multiple photos, just tap the action button in the upper right corner, select some photos, and tap the Delete button.\n\n\n", "Q: Unified Inbox in Mail does not display all emails I have 4 different email accounts in Mail; therefore, there are 4 different inboxes. \nWhen I select the unified Inbox, I should see all emails listed from all accounts. But I don't. \nWhat could be preventing seeing all email in unified inbox? 3 email accounts are POP; 1 is MobileMe IMAP. When I control-click on unified Inbox, all email accounts are in the drop-down list. One of the POP accounts shows nothing in large box below that.\n(Snow Leopard 10.6.8 with Mail version equivalent for Snow Leopard.)\n\nA: My guess is that one of your clients is removing emails from the server - last time I used POP this was the default, and it was one of the best reasons for switching to IMAP. If any of your clients is doing this then those emails will not be appearing on your other clients. Have you checked this on each client that you access those servers with?\nI know you didn't say you access those emails from multiple places but it's a common thing to do.\n", "Q: Reduce iPhone Ringer Volume Without Affecting Messagaging Alert Volume I need to know how I can lower the volume on my phone ringer without lowering the volume for messaging alerts.  At night, I need Messaging to be LOUD, but I want my phone ringer to be barely audible (note: ringer still needs to emit some sound, not completely turned off).\n\nA: Sadly this isn't an option on a non-jailbroken device.\n\nA: One option is to use a silent (or very quiet) ringtone for phone calls and then have the normal sound play for messages. This site has a walkthrough. You could also use the same trick to silence calls from specific numbers.\n", "Q: Can't download previous purchases in iTunes I'm trying to download a specific episode of 24, that I have previously bought and I keep getting an error message that is completely out of place.\nI have tried to download many previous purchases and all result in the same error:\n\nHowever I am on my computer, and I am connected to Wifi.\nI am able to download new purchases as usual, it is only previous purchases.\nHow can I get around this error which is blantantly incorrect?\n\nA: You could rule out the possibility of a local problem by attempting to download purchases on another authorised device, and refine the diagnosis by trying it both on and off that same wireless network. \nOr you could head straight for iTunes support - when I got corrupted characters in my pre-purchased copy of the Steve Jobs biography last year they had a fix to me within two hours. Based on the Q&A so far I think you're going to need to get Apple to look at your account.\n", "Q: Is there a way to access iCloud's Photo Stream from the Finder, similar to Windows? On Windows, Photo Stream works in a way that all the files are automatically copied to your 'My Pictures' folder or the like. \nI currently have Photo Stream working in Aperture, but every once in a while I think it would be nice to have direct access to Photo Stream in the Finder, so I could possibly script something (i.e., copy photos to Dropbox, add automatically Evernote, etc). \nIs there a way that I can reach this, outside of iPhoto or Aperture on the Mac? And do one of these apps have to 'trigger' a sync from iCloud? Or is Photo Stream syncing automatically somewhere on the file system?\nThis could be a direct path, a smart folder, etc. \n\nA: After doing some research, I finally found where they were located, and then figured a quick way to get back to them. \nThe files themselves are stored in hashed folders under ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub. \nI then created a Smart Folder using this path, and then selecting Kind as \"Image\". This then provides me with a directory with just the images in Photo Stream, outside of their folders. \n\nI also verified that this was working on a machine where iPhoto didn't have Photo Stream enabled itself, the only Photo Stream part was enabled in System Preferences. Therefore, it was syncing on its own, and not with a relation to iPhoto having to launch to trigger it. \nYou can't cd into a smart folder, but it looks like I can use some actions with it it. I moreso wanted a direct folder, so I could copy stuff out quickly.\n\nA: In short, no.\nAperture's Photo Stream album is accessible in the Finder at ~/Pictures/Aperture Library.aplibrary/Database/Albums/, but good luck viewing it without using Aperture.\n\n\nA: You can use my PhotoStream2Folder application to exploit this folder and store the images where you want on your drive.\n", "Q: Accept auto-correct suggestion with one keystroke Sometimes, there's an auto-correct suggestion I want to accept, but I don't want to type a period or space followed by a delete. Nor do I want to hit down arrow, return. (That's incredibly lazy of me, now that I think about it.)\nIs there any way, barring macro apps, to do this with one keystroke?\n\nA: I have 69 non-modifier keys on my MacBook Air and 9 modifier keys. Having worked my way through all 78 single keystrokes possible on my keyboard, I can say with confidence that none of them have the effect of both accepting the autocorrect suggestion and not producing any input on your system. If you are looking for a single key press, the answer is definitively, as set up out of the box, no this cannot be done.

I see most of popular iOS apps allow only upload one picture at a time to the service's backend storage. Is there any reason why they don't support upload multiple pictures in one shot? \n\nA: Why yes - the iOS photo picker has been modal for some time now and allows one picture to be selected by apps that use the long time iOS API to access the camera or the picture roll and albums.\nFurthermore, copy and paste is also a single item and there is no clipboard history functionality in iOS.\nI suppose a jailbroken device could be modified - but I don't know of any apps or work to actually do that, so this is a theoretical capability to my awareness.\nYou can use the Photo all (and the new iPhoto app as well) to send multiple photos to email or a message. In that case, you can email these multiple pictures directly to a Posterous Spaces account that you have set up using the Posterous app. Twitter has purchased Posterous recently and announced that the service will not be shutting down immediately and that users will have an export tool and notice should the service get shuttered in the future.\n\nA: It all depends on how the app developers chose to implement the software.\nTake Dropbox as an example. It's pretty popular and let's you upload multiple photos at once:\n\nIn fact, I would also expect them to eventually make it automatically upload all your photos as part of their auto photo upload feature they are rolling out.\n\nFor facebook on the other hand, you may need to use a 3rd party application such as SwingVine or iLoader, until Facebook change their application to allow this feature.\n", "Q: Why can I not edit some photos Imported from an iPhone to Windows Vista?

If there is any demand I may write a cleaned-up UI version but for now it's a simple Java Commandline utility.\n\nA: I was having the same problem, but I was able to fix it by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your picture in Paint.\n\n*Save it in .bmp format.\n\n*Open your Windows Live Photo Gallery and there make a copy in .jpg format and save it.\n\n*Open this in any photo editor software, and you should be able to edit it.\n\n", "Q: How to disable Finder triangle reveal animation in 10.7 Lion In Finder's list view, you can click the little triangles to the left of folder icons in order to reveal the contents of the folder. In 10.7 Lion, this reveal/expansion is accompanied by a vertical sliding animation.\nMy problem is (a) the animation slows me down and (b) the animation will often hiccup even on my new i7 Mac Mini with external video card (especially on folders containing many files).\nI've searched high and low on the googlesphere for a solution to this, but I've only come across these terminal commands, to no effect:\n1\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AnimateInfoPanes -bool false\n\nNo effect on Finder, info panes don't seem to have reveal animation anyway\n2\ndefaults write com.apple.finder DisableAllAnimations -bool true\n\nNo discernible effect on Finder\n3\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool NO\n\nThis does disable the zoomimg new window animation in all apps, but doesn't affect my issue\nIs this an issue for anyone else? Does anyone have a solution?\n\nA: I've been looking for this solution for quite some time.  What this is is an NSOutlineView.  The expanding and collapsing of an NSOutlineView now always animates the roll down and roll up of the content and makes you wait for it to finish before you can actually see and use the content.  It's infuriatingly irritating that we can not turn this unwanted \"feature\" off so that it functions as before.\nAccording to a developer at Apple, there is no way to do this and I was encouraged to file a request since this is an annoying addition to the OS that you can not turn of that was not present in previous system releases.\nI've reported the bug/usability regression to Apple.

Apple has featured Voice Dictation as one of the marquee features of the new iPad. Either through a app that ships with the iPad or an App Store one, can the iPad record audio (as for a podcast) and at the same time transcribe the text therein?\n\nA: No, this does not work.\nI started a background recording with DropVox, then switched over to PlainText and tapped the dictation button and dictated a sentence. I then switched back to DropVox and it looked like it was still recording (the counter was still going up). I stopped it, it uploaded the file, but when I listened to it the start and end were there, but the part from when I started dictating to when I opened DropVox back up wasn't. Very strange, but ultimately the answer is it doesn't work.\nIf you're curious, the resultant audio file can be found here. \"And it looks like the timer's still going\" was said after DropVox opened back up.\n\nA: OK, so a possible workflow is thus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Record audio file\n\n*Transfer audio file to iPhone or iPod touch\n\n*Sit iPhone/iPod touch next to iPad\n\n*Get text editor app set up to transcribe on iPad\n\n*Play audio via speakers on iPhone/iPod touch\n\n*Generate transcript of audio file\n\n\nA: I've had a look in developer docs and I don't think it's possible for any app to do this. I was thinking of a line input recording audio while Voice Dictation processes input from the built-in mic - but the developer docs don't show me any way to select which audio input is active at any one time. \nThere is only a simple boolean available to AVAudioSession, the class providing the recording context for an iOS app, to determine whether an audio input source is available with no means of enumerating or selecting any specific input. \n", "Q: Does PhotoStream copy videos too or just still photos? If I use PhotoStream to sync photos from an iOS device and my Mac, will it transfer videos too? Are the higher resolution videos from the new iPad treated any differently than other devices?\n\nA: The iCloud Photo Stream FAQ says no - photos only.\n\nA: Apparently, some research after posting the question tells me that the answer is no to the first question, making the second a rather trivial no also.\nAccording to Apple, PhotoStream is only for still-photos.\n", "Q: Identify Podcasts in Smart Playlist? I'd like to exclude all podcast-type items from a Smart Playlist my iTunes library.

I used this to create my .osx file which is full of hidden OS X tweaks.\nOpen Terminal.app, cd into a temporary directory, and check the difference between defaults read output before and after changing the setting.\ncd /tmp\ndefaults read > a\n# change the setting using TinkerTool or however you like\ndefaults read > b\ndiff a b # view the difference\n\nIf you’d rather use a UI to view the diffs instead of the diff binary, you could download the Kaleidoscope.app trial.\n\nAlternatively, you could do a Spotlight search within the past hour/day/minute for plist files. That will only tell you which file changed, though; you would still have to figure out which setting in the file was tweaked.\n\nA: This may not really be the answer you´re looking for, but I´d suggest having a look at secrets.blacktree.com for a very good database of hidden OS X settings (they also offer a preference pane to manipulate them). \nIf you´re looking for a more specific function that is available in TinkerTool, chances are that someone around here will know the command line way for it ;-) \n\nA: The most GUI-friendly way I can think of would be to use the endlessly-fascinating fseventer, which lets you see which files on your disk are changing, in real time. With a bit of filtering, you can narrow it down to showing only those files that are changing in your Preferences folders, as you make settings changes in TinkerTool (or anywhere else).\n\nA: Here is something you might try:\n1) Purchase the paid version of TinkerTool for €11.90. It's called TinkerTool System 2.\n2) Send an email to the developer, Marcel Bresink. Tell him that you are a paid customer. Ask him nicely if he will tell you the answer to your specific question.\nI don't know Marcel, but in my experience, independent shareware software developers are very helpful when you help them out by buying one of their modestly-priced products.\n", "Q: What does setting Media Kind to Audiobook do? If I change the Media Kind option on a track to Audiobook, what does effects does that have on my iTunes library?  How does it change the presentation and functionality of the track?\n\nA: Jesse Hollington wrote a great guide to Audiobook handling \"The Complete Guide to iTunes Books, Podcasts + iTunes U\" at iLounge. Basically it comes down to separating AudioBooks from music and providing different sync and management options within iTunes.\nYour sync differences are obvious, you get a different sync category enabling you to sync all or selected Audiobooks. One really interesting difference is that on iOS devices, media kind Audiobook lets you adjust playback speed. I haven't tried setting a music track to audiobook and then changing playback speed - might be useful for learning guitar tracks if pitch is maintained.\n\nA: If an MP3 has its Media Kind set to Audiobook (in the Options tab):\n\nthen iTunes will do some different things, compared to Music type tracks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Audiobooks will appear in their own section of the iTunes library, rather than in the Music section. For me, it was a huge improvement to get these items out of my Music library.  \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If your Audiobook is a .m4b file, you can play it at twice the regular speed.\n\n\nThe Remember playback position option isn't solely a property of Audiobooks, but if you're importing Audiobooks you might want to check that this is enabled.  \n", "Q: 1st gen iPad charges slowly and doesn't show charging indicator A few months ago, my 1st generation iPad fell on the carpet and started having issues with charging. Note: it wasn't plugged in to anything when it fell.\nWhen I tried charging it, it didn't show any indication that it was charging.\nI took it to the Apple store, and they said that it can no longer charge and that the only thing I can do is get a new iPad. I decided to go home and try leaving it plugged in to the wall for several hours and see what happens. After 4 hours of charging, the charge only rose by 5%. Note: the iPad was on, but the screen was off.\nWhen I tried turning the device off and charging it overnight, it was able to charge to 100%.\nSo my two problems are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The charging indicator no longer shows up.\n\n*It takes a long time to charge while the iPad is on.\n\n\nIs there any way to fix these two problems? If it's a physical problem with one of the components of the iPad, which one would I need to replace to fix these issues?\n\nI'm guessing that Apple came to that conclusion because they didn't have time to leave it plugged in and wait a few hours just to see it charge a little bit. Therefore, I understand why Apple thought it could never be charged again.\nNote: I'm using the charger that came with it, and I've tried other chargers as well. Apple tried their own chargers too.\n\nA: Did you try charging using another USB cable (the one for your iPhone, perhaps) and see if that made a difference? I’d recommend testing this first before replacing attempting to replace any components yourself.\nThat said, it’s most likely a battery issue.\nHere’s a guide on how to replace the first-generation iPad’s battery yourself.\n\nA: I'd say it's more than likely an issue with the dock connector or it's connection to the internal circuitry (the flexi connector)\nThere will be circuitry that will be there to detect the connector, some also to detect the current in the charging circuit and feedback to the iPad for both.\nIt's obvious to me that the loop for the current detection, or the feedback signal it generated is broken, but I've not been able to determine where that functionality lives.\nFrom experience in design of rechargeable devuces, such circuitry can be very small and might be a tiny chip embedded in the flexi connector.\n\nA: Did it fall while it was plugged into the cable?\nYou should consider replacing the dock connector and the battery pack.  Those are the two less-expensive parts that are most likely the culprit, and the iPad is still a valuable enough device that it's worth replacing them.  There are many source for these parts and services that will fix them for you.  Try searching google for \"ipad repair\" \"ipad battery replacement\" \"ipod dock repair part\" and you should have a number of sources for parts or service.\niFixit has reasonably good guides for disassembly and repair, and the iPad first generation is notably easier to repair than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPads.  \nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-iPad-3G-Battery-Replacement/3186/1\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing-iPad-3G-Dock-Connector-Cable/3187/1\n\nThe only thing between the charger and the battery is the dock connector/flex cable.  You can try replacing just that component and see if it resolves the problem, but since that ipad is 1-2 years old, and a new battery is only $50, and you're taking it apart anyway, you might as well replace the battery while you're in there.\nIt's probably not a software problem, however you can erase it and refresh the entire OS from iTunes to double check before spending money on parts and time on replacing them.\nIf it is a hardware problem, chances are very good that replacing the battery and dock connector/cable assembly will resolve it.  If that doesn't fix it, and a software refresh doesn't fix it, then there's a problem with the main logic board, and replacing that is expensive - might as well get the iPad 2 instead.  Used iPad gen 1 and gen 2 are pretty inexpensive as people are upgrading, so it might not even be worth your time and expenses to fix it.  Sell it on ebay noting the charging problem, and you'll probably still get a good bit of cash from it toward a new ipad.\n", "Q: How can I wirelessly get videos off of a new iPad? If one has a New iPad and uses it to shoot video, is there a way to wirelessly transfer videos off the iPad and onto my Mac?\nWe've established that PhotoStream is for still photos only, so that won't be the solution.\n\nA: You could use iTunes Wi-Fi syncing.\nPrior to iOS 5, you would have to plug in your device to sync with iTunes.\nAs of iOS 5, 2 new features were introduced:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud\n\n*Wi-Fi syncing with iTunes\n\n\nFor people like me that mainly used iTunes for backup purposes, iCloud eliminated the need for syncing with iTunes altogether. However, there are people that still sync with iTunes and thus Wi-Fi syncing could help.\nIt does the exact same thing as syncing with the cable but you don't need to have anything attached. Both computers just need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. Apple has all the steps necessary in order to get this working.\nOne of the things lacking on Apple's page is how to force a sync from your device. On an iPhone, you would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Settings.\n\n*Navigate to General > iTunes Wi-Fi Sync\n\n*Press Sync Now. (Note: This will only appear if you have set up Wi-Fi syncing according to Apple's directions and that computer is on and connected to the same network.)\n\n\nA: Another solution is to use a 3rd party app such as PhotoSync ($2).\nThe advantages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*It won't degrade the quality (unlike email).\n\n*It doesn't require you to sync the entire device (unlike iTunes Wi-Fi sync).\n\n*It doesn't send the data over the Internet (unlike an app such as Dropbox).\n\n\nA: When you open a video in your photo library you have the option to email video, send to YouTube.\nYou can also copy it in case some third party app lets you paste a video for upload? Dropbox (for iPad) can upload videos too.\n\nA: Unless you are looking for some kind of synchronization solution (e.g., an app to push your personal videos), the simplest solution would be to email it to yourself via the built in sharing feature. \n", "Q: How to checksum for a DVD under Panther? I'm helping a friend checking if a DVD was burned properly but he's saying that  under Panther there's no Images menu in Disk Utility.\n\nA: It looks like Panther's hdiutil supports checksumming, even if the Disk Utility GUI might not:\nhdiutil checksum myimage.dmg -type MD5\n\n(The supported types of checksums are listed in the man page. A common one seems to be UDIF-CRC32. If you use UDIF-CRC32 or UDIF-MD5 the checksums will be calculated separately per partition.)\nOr you could always simply use the md5 command:\nmd5 myimage.dmg\n\n\nA: Use hdiutil on the mounted drive:\nhdiutil checksum /dev/disk1 -type UDIF-CRC32\n\nThe final calculated CRC appears at the bottom when the command completes running:\nmacbook:~ me$ hdiutil checksum /dev/disk1 -type UDIF-CRC32\nChecksumming Driver Descriptor Map (DDM : 0)…\n Driver Descriptor Map (DDM : 0): calculated CRC32 $4F7D78B1\nChecksumming Apple (Apple_partition_map : 1)\n Apple (Apple_partition_map : 1): calculated CRC32 $C4E22BED\nChecksumming disk image (Apple_HFS : 2)\n      disk image (Apple_HFS : 2): calculated CRC32 $04805620\nChecksumming  (Apple_Free : 3)…\n(Apple_Free : 3): calculated CRC32 $00000000\ncalculated CRC32 $52BB898F\n\nThis final calculated CRC ($52BB898F in the above example) is exactly the same as the one reported by Disk Utility: \n\nYou can use the diskutil list command for assistance in finding out the mounted drive's name.\n", "Q: Unable to manage mobile account settings I'm trying to manage my mobile account settings after migrating my local account to a network account.\nThe problem is that the settings button is greyed out.\n\nHow can I change this in order to get my local account syncing with my home server?\nnote: the lock icon is \"locked\" in the screenshot, however even unlocked the settings button is still grey\n\nA: This is something you'll have to change in Workgroup Manager on your home server (assuming you're using Mac OS X Server). \nWhat you'll need to do is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Workgroup Manager from /Applications/Server\n\n*Authenticate as a server administrator\n\n*Find your user account and go to the Preferences tab\n\n*Go to Mobility\n\n*Change all the managed preferences from Once or Always to Never:\n\nLog out and log back in on your client computer and you should be good to go!\n\nA: I had to go into active directory (Windows 2008 R2) and go to the user's properties. From there, Profile Tab, then the \"connect\" radio button under \"Home folder\" has to have any drive letter selected, and a UNC path the the location that the users home folder will reside.\n", "Q: Saving a picture to a file in Skitch with one click? Is there any way to press a single button in Skitch and have it save the current image to a folder of your choosing (e.g. Documents). This is as opposed to using the drag and drop feature and having to open up finder and only then dropping the picture there.\nI'm looking for something simple like the Save to history button on top.\n\nA: If you press ⌘ Command+E, it brings up an Export window where you can select the destination to export:\n\n(I would suggest pressing ⌘ Command+⇧ Shift+O to switch to the Documents folder, but it seems this doesn't work in Skitch's Export window!)\n\nA: As others have pointed out you can't save with one click. My solution is to create a folder specific to the project I'm working on which I place in the dock. Then I just drag the skitch tab to that folder. This way I can quickly create a few image variations and have them in one place ready for whatever's next. This method is handy too because you can very quickly set the image file type, drop it off and get back to manipulation.\n\nA: No.\nThere is no other single-click option besides saving (edited) pictures to the history.\n\nYou can however create an Alias of the Skitch folder ~/Pictures/Skitch where the history is saved and drag it to a custom location.\n  → \n", "Q: How can I force my keyboard backlight to turn on? I have a MacBook Pro. When it senses the ambient light is low, the backlit keyboard turns on, and there are keys that let me control its brightness.\nBut when enough light reaches the ambient light sensor, the backlight turns off and I can't adjust it:\n\nIn some settings the screen may be illuminated, but the keyboard is not well-lit and hard to see, so I'd really like the backlight to turn on. Is there any way to force-enable it?\n\nA: gentmatt’s answer seems useful!\nAlternatively, you could try going to System Preferences → Keyboard, and unchecking the “Automatically illuminate keyboard in low light” setting. That should prevent the “disabled” icon from your screenshot altogether.\n\n\nA: You can just put your hand front of iSight sensor and then press backlight keys.\nLike this:\n\n\nA: Another solution: put a piece of tape or something over the ambient light sensor.  It will always think it is night.  The sensor is either below the speakers or on the display somewhere (on my early 2008 MacBook Pro, it was below the speakers; on my new Retina MacBook Pro, it is right next to the camera).  You can find it by running your hand across the computer in full light until the keys light up.  Note that if it's below the speakers, it might require both speakers to be covered.\n\nA: LabTick allows you to manually control the keyboard backlight:\n\n\nA: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1305637\nI tried this after replacing my RAM.

We would like to know if Apple keeps track of iOS App opening by users.\nFor example, Facebook keeps track of Facebook app opening to collect data of Facebook Insight.\nDoes Apple keep track of user behaviours like iOS app opening by users? Thanks.\n\nA: I just tested this using Apple’s built-in “Music” app on an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1, using ngrep and tcpdump to monitor network activity. No connections to Apple servers are being made when opening an app on any iOS device.\nAs you mentioned, individual apps (e.g. Facebook) may keep track of data like this by pinging a server every time you open their app — but Apple does not do anything like this globally.\n", "Q: Do non-retina graphics looks worse on a retina display than they did before? There are complaints that non-retina apps look terrible compared to retina apps on a retina iPad.\nIs this purely in comparison with high-resolution apps, or does it actually look worse than it did on an iPad without the retina display, i.e. do four pixels forming one big virtual pixel on a retina display look worse than one big pixel of the exact same size on the old display?\n\nA: Not to me - it probably looks worse because you are seeing the difference now more readily. Subjectively things look worse because you now expect a new-iPad level display. I had this effect when iPhone 4 came out, everything looked fine until I saw one.\nIt's not just the increased resolution that has improved - the maximum brightness of the new iPad display is brighter and the minimum brightness is dimmer. Dan Frakes noted this in MacWorld on March 30 2012 and it is important - the screen does look better if you can adjust the brightness to the right level, bright in the sunlight and dim when you're reading in the dark. Given that I say that non-retina graphics should in fact look better on the new iPad display when greater ability to adjust brightness matters.\nI don't know if you ever played Marathon for Mac, late 90's game. State of the art graphics in its day, but now it's hard to tolerate when you play it on a modern machine. Not because it looks worse on a modern LCD but because you expect so much more.\n(if you're interested - get the Marathon trilogy for Mac OS X - a GPL'ed release by Bungie)\nWith computers, you truly never can go back.\n\nA: The retina display of the new iPad has both...\n\n\n*\n\n*a four times higher pixel density\n\n*a better color saturation\n\n\nMore vibrant colors will improve the looks of anything displayed on the screen. So this should make \"non-retina compatible\" games more fun as well.\nHowever, all of the iOS apps by Apple are in high-res and due to the huge difference in the used pixels, non-retina apps will appear to have worse graphics.\nThe retina display is theoratically able to display four times the content. Apps that make use of only 1/4 of the pixel resolution are perceived less detailed.\n\n\nA: As far as the graphics go, they look just the same on both screens. It’s just that you get used to the high-resolution Retina display very quickly, so you notice the difference when you “go back” to the old graphics by opening an app that isn’t optimized for the Retina display.\nOther than that, there are other display specifications that may differ between two devices. When the iPhone 4 came out for example, I remember the colors were much more vivid on the new display than on that of an iPhone 3GS, regardless of the Retina display. I’m not sure how much the new iPad display differs from older screens in terms of color calibration, though.\n", "Q: New MacBook Pro: Migration Assistant or Time Capsule? I'm in the process of buying a new MacBook Pro.\nMy actual notebook is a MacBook Pro Core Duo which dates back to July 2006.\nMy actual operating system is Snow Leopard, and I have a Time Capsule unit in place since 2010, so my backups are OK.\nNow the question is: when my new computer arrives it'll have Lion; I'd like to take back my whole digital life from my backups in Time Capsule, but I'm wondering they are coming from Snow Leopard. Could this represent a problem for system restore?\nWould it be better in this case to proceed with a Migration Assistant operation?\n\nA: It actually doesn't matter. If you install Lion you can use the Time Machine backup as the source for restoring all data through Migration Assistant. It works exactly the same as if you put your old machine into target disk mode and use it as a drive for Migration Assistant. \n(I was really surprised to find this out a couple of days ago when shuffling hard drives - 3 bad SSDs in a row, long story - and I was not allowed to select Time Machine to restore from because it was too large for the 240GB SSD, after using a 750GB spinning disk for a while - even though I had carefully excluded enough data to be sure it would fit. Then when Migration Assistant came up it allowed me to use the Time Machine drive to restore all the data I wanted anyway - all 90GB of it. All's well now, and this unexpected feature of Time Machine saved me some time.)\n\nA: In general restoring from Time Machine or using the Migration Assistant is not much of a difference (you can even neglect speed, if you consider using the Gigabit Ethernet ports in both cases). What won´t work (if you´re thinking about the newest MacBook Pros) is simply copying the old hard drive to the new one, since Snow Leopard (as far as I know) never incorporated the drivers required for the newest generation of MacBooks.\n", "Q: Which iPad PDF viewers (annotators, readers, whatevers) give a faithful rendering? I got a bit of a surprise when viewing a PDF today.  I'd originally looked at it on my iPad in Safari.  Then I looked at it later on my Linux machine using xpdf.  It looked ... different.  Here are the screenshots:\nSafari on iPad:\n\nxpdf on Linux:\n\nThis is a document produced by Adobe, so I'd expect them to get the PDF stuff right.  I therefore attribute it to the renderer rather than malformed PDF.  Here's the specs for the PDF:\n% pdfinfo /tmp/PDF_Transparency.pdf \nTitle:          Transparency in PDF   Technical Note #5407\nSubject:        Transparency in PDF files\nKeywords:       PDF Transparency\nAuthor:         Adobe Developer Technologies\nCreator:        FrameMaker 6.0\nProducer:       Acrobat Distiller 4.05 for Macintosh\nCreationDate:   Fri Dec  1 16:41:40 2000\nModDate:        Fri Dec 15 16:53:01 2000\nTagged:         no\nPages:          82\nEncrypted:      no\nPage size:      612 x 792 pts (letter)\nFile size:      420449 bytes\nOptimized:      yes\nPDF version:    1.3\n\nI got the document from the wayback machine at  http://web.archive.org/web/20011109072226/http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/acrosdk/docs/PDF_Transparency.pdf.\nAs a mathematician, the appalling rendering of the formula is extremely worrisome.\nI tested this in a couple of other PDF-capable apps and they had the same rendering as Safari with the - obvious! - exception of Adobe Reader which had the True Rendering.  The fact that disparate apps give the same incorrect rendering makes me wonder if PDF rendering is something that is inbuilt to iOS5 and which most PDF apps use, but Adobe Reader chooses to ignore.\nSo my question(s) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is that assumption correct?  If so, that makes reporting the bug easier as it implies that I can report it to a central place and if it gets fixed there it will propagate out.  So if so, where do I report it?\n\n*Are there PDF apps that get this right?  I've listed Adobe Reader above as one that does, I can report that GoodReader, GoodNotes, iAnnotator, Explain Everything, iBooks do not.  I've provided the source above to make it easy for people to check.  The screenshots are from p7 (internal numbering, p13 absolute).\n\n*Last one: was I just unlucky with this document?  I've been happily using mathematically-heavy documents on the iPad without noticing anything like this.  Should I be worried?\n\n\nA: It seems to me that maybe not enough Fonts have been embedded in this (\"old\") PDF. I downloaded it on my Mac, opened it in Preview and exported it under a different name (without changing anything else). \nGoodReader on my iPhone now shows the alpha´s correctly. Inspecting it with Acrobat Professional now shows more imbedded Fonts than before (and of course a newer PDF standard being used).\n\nA: The work around posted by Asmus works in Explain Everything as well.\nBasically, Apple approved iOS apps use a built in PDF renderer in the iOS SDK.  There are open source PDF renderer's that could be used within apps but they are incompatible with the Apple Store license.\nThe solution would be for Apple to address this in their PDF renderer and the fix would propagate to all apps that use it.\nWe can submit the bug to Apple via our developer account and hope that enough other devs raise the question for it to eventually get resolved.\nReshan Richards\nCo-Creator of Explain Everything\n", "Q: Is it possible to get the API details and protocol details from an MFI certified Accessory Manufacturer? I am not planning to manufacture any Hardware. I wanted to create an app for an existing MFI certified devices.\nIs it possible to get the API details and protocol details from an MFI certified Accessory Manufacturer? \nEDIT:\nI plan to develop an App for an existing MFi certified hardware and release an app in the store.\n\nA: The Apple MFI NDA requires that accessory developers not divulge any information about the device protocols, security chip, interface, etc.\nHowever, device manufacturers are allowed to create libraries and SDKs that others can use to release apps that use their device.\nOne example is Redpark, for instance I have a few of their serial cables:\nhttp://www.redpark.com/c2db9.html\nYou have access to as much of the device as they permit through their SDK, and you can release apps using that SDK that works with their device.  You can search the app store for \"redpark\" and find many apps that use their various iOS cables.\nSo yes, it is possible - nothing in the Apple NDA prevents them from disclosing and providing their API to others.  They simply cannot disclose Apple's protocol/API/interface to others.\nDo note that Apple requires a company to submit device samples and use cases for MFI approval, and it appears they don't allow many developers to develop devices for which they plan to release SDKs.  There have been efforts to create universal infrared remote accessories for instance that haven't been opened even though the developers originally intended to provide an SDK. One I discussed this with indicated that Apple wouldn't approve their device unless it was tied to one, and only one app - theirs.  I understand in cases such as redpark the developers made the cables for specific customers and specific apps first, then started making generic cables for generic apps after initial approval.\nSo there still may be some reluctance on the part of Apple to allow developers to design open API devices.\nWhile your question is about MFi accesories, a number of third party accessories have come out which are not MFi.  Many use Wifi or the audio jack to communicate with their iOS apps, such as http://www.60beat.com/ .  Several credit card readers plug into the audio jack.  Not all of them give their SDK/API freely, but you can always ask.  \n\nA: I would say unlikely.\n\n\n*\n\n*if a partner in the MFI program is creating a device that works using standard protocols and APIs then there would be no need to contact the manufacturer since the APIs are open\n\n*if a partner in the MFI program has created a device with custom APIs and non-standard protocols then they will have created their own App to talk to their device and would have no reason to open their APIs\n\n\nThe exception are manufacturers who want to be the next big thing, creating devices that they want to be integrated into other apps.  They will use proprietary protocols and APIs but open them up for outside developer use in the hope of gaining traction in the marketplace for their hardware and pehaps becoming a standard. In this way they move from being the latter to the former .  Sometimes they will want you to licence their IP to develop your App in return for the information.\nThe only way to find out which is contact the manufacturer in question and ask them.\n", "Q: What is the cheapest way to get windows running on a Mac I want to get windows running alongside Mac OSX, just so I can run one program not available om Mac OSX. what is the cheapest way to get this set up?\n\nA: Microsoft provides virtual machine disk images to facilitate website testing in multiple versions of IE, regardless of the host operating system. Unfortunately, setting these virtual machines up without Microsoft's VirtualPC can be extremely difficult.\nThe so-called ievms scripts aim to facilitate that process using VirtualBox on Linux or OS X. With a single command, you can have IE6, IE7, IE8 and IE9 running in separate virtual machines.\nObviously, this tool is aimed at web developers, but if you don’t care about testing in Internet Explorer and you simply need a working Windows VM, you could just install a single VM running Windows Vista + IE9 using this command (after installing VirtualBox, of course):\n# enter this in Terminal.app after installing VirtualBox\ncurl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS=\"9\" bash\n\nA snapshot is automatically taken upon install, allowing rollback to the pristine virtual environment configuration. Anything can go wrong in Windows and rather than having to worry about maintaining a stable VM, you can simply revert to the clean snapshot to reset your VM to the initial state.\nThe VMs provided by Microsoft will not pass the Windows Genuine Advantage and cannot be activated. Unfortunately for us, that means our VMs will lock us out after 30 days of unactivated use. By reverting to the clean snapshot the countdown to the activation apocalypse is reset, effectively allowing your VM to work indefinitely.\nThis is effectively a free and legal solution to running a Windows VM on your Mac.\n\nIn reply to @josh3736’s comment: here’s an excerpt from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11575:\n\nNote: You may be required to activate the OS as the product key has been deactivated. This is the expected behavior. The VHDs will not pass genuine validation. Immediately after you start the Windows 7 or Windows Vista images they will request to be activated. You can cancel the request and it will login to the desktop. You can activate up to two “rearms” (type slmgr –rearm at the command prompt) which will extend the trial for another 30 days each time OR simply shutdown the VPC image and discard the changes you’ve made from undo disks to reset the image back to its initial state.  By doing either of these methods, you can technically have a base image which never expires although you will never be able to permanently save any changes on these images for longer than 90 days.\n\n\nA: If you just need one program, you could try running it using Wine. This is a compatibility layer that allows you to run Windows software on *nix systems, which includes Mac OS X. Here is a tutorial to help you get started. \nNote that not every Windows programs will run using Wine - you might need to experiment first. Or head over to the Wine Application Database for user reviews on how well your program is supported.\nAlternatively, you could use one of the many virtualization options out there. Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion are excellent but paid options, while VirtualBox is free (and it works great too). However, you'd need a Windows license to legally run Windows in this way.\n\nA: The cheapest way to run a Windows OS along side Mac OS X would be with Virtual Box. Ifs a free x86 virtual machine environment and will run many versions of Microsoft Windows as well as many other OS's both 32bit and 64bit versions.  As for obtaining a copy of windows on the cheap do avoid retail full price versions of the Windows OS, for Windows 7 they start at about $199 USD for a full non upgrade license.   Instead look for OEM versions of the version of windows you need online. For example Windows 7 starts at about $99 for an OEM version.  Also if your in college or in the education field or a spouse is, try checking on Academic Discounts offered from Microsoft.  Additionally see if your employer offers software discounts for personal use, some do and its worth looking into especially considering the significant cost of a legitimate Windows license.\n\nA: You buy an OEM version of Windows 7 Home Premium ($100) and install it using Apple's included Boot Camp installer.\nThat is the best way to do it IMO and will give you the best performance.  \n\nA: There is also Crossover.. its a lot cheaper than VmWare and Parallels. I used to run Vmware to run a single windows app too.. but I gave up on it and now use Crossover and am very happy.\nCrossover is based on Wine - therefore u do NOT need to install Windows (and thus require a Windows install disk) as u do for VmWare and Parallels.\nThere is a free trial so u can download it and see if your app works. If your app is unsupported (as mine was) dont worry. Try installing it using the \"unsupported applications\" option. My 550MB windows app installed and works fine!\n\nA: If you want to make just one program run then I would suggest looking at Wineskin. This is a wrapper around Wine that has been mentioned in the other answers. \nThe main reason I would recommend it is that it has been the easiest way I have found to get an application running ie it hides the wine configuration which is non trivial. However if your application depends on may windows libraries then you will have to deal withe the configuration.\n", "Q: How to automatically login to captive portals on OS X? How can I automatically login to captive portals on OS X?\nA captive portal is used by (often not password-protected) wireless networks that present a web page as soon as you connect to them, requiring you to login.\nI have to login to different wireless networks like this very frequently, and none of the captive portals seem to remember my login/password information. Is there a way to automate the login process somehow, or at least store the login/password pairs in the Keychain?\nUpdate: There’s an iOS app called AutoWifi that basically handles this. If it’s possible to do this on iOS with all its restrictions, surely it must be possible to do something like it on OS X, right?\n\nRelated fun fact: This is how Apple tests for captive portals on OS X and iOS:\n\nOS X and iOS make a request to http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html every time you connect to a WiFi network.\n\nAs of Yosemite the URL is now:  http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html\nThis URL returns the following HTML:\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN\">\n<HTML>\n<HEAD>\n    <TITLE>Success</TITLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY>\nSuccess\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n\nA: Just found this Disable Captive Network Support in OS X\nWhich mentions \"To disable it, set this preference:\"\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.captive.control Active -boolean false\n\nIn case, you would ever want to remove this setting, you can do:\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.captive.control Active\n\nThen, as @Leon mentions, use the regular web browser to login. Or if you are on a network where that somehow does not work then you can still try and open the app manually ( located at /System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app )\n\nA: Doesn't deleting (or renaming) /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/CaptiveNetworkSupport/Settings.plist stop the auto-probing?\nIt could at least stop the opening of the WebView popup.\nOtherwise replace all URLs in that Settings.plist with a local hosted copy of the success.html file and host the success.html file on your localhost webserver.\n\nA: I seeing captive portal requests on my home network every 5 min. \nBut I've changed in file /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/CaptiveNetworkSupport/Settings.plist\nstring: http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html\nto http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html\n(I meant ProbeURL section).\napple changed probe URL for new OS, I do not know why, but new URL response is 200 (OK) and should works (I've faced with same problem on my mbp 2011 Mavericks).\n\nA: With some help using AppleScript, Lynx, Fakeapp/Safari, and ControlPlane, My MacBook now always connected to captive portal automatically in my office. It still not an efficient way to make it, but it still get the job done perfectly. I hope someone can make it simpler.\nHere's the code:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure we are in correct SSID\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -I | awk '/ SSID: / {print $2}'\"\n\n\n*Check captive portal address existence\ntry\n    do shell script (\"ping -c 2 \" & CaptiveAddress) -- set your captive address here\n    set CaptiveExist to \"yes\"\non error\n    set CaptiveExist to \"no\"\nend try\n\n\n*Test portal connection\ntry\n    set PortalOpened to do shell script (\"/usr/local/bin/lynx --dump http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html | grep 'Success'\")\n    if PortalOpened is \"   Success\" then\n        set PortalOpened to \"yes\"\n    else\n        set PortalOpened to \"no\"\n    end if\non error\n    set PortalOpened to \"no\"        \nend try\n\n\n*Logging in to portal\ntell application \"Fake\"\n    load URL \"http://YourPortalAddress.html\" -- put your captive address here\n    set value of element with name \"username\" to \"user\"\n    set value of element with name \"password\" in form with name \"password\" to \"password\"\n    click element with id \"logincaption\"\nend tell\n\n\n*Save those scripts as one application. Then use ControlPlane rules to make it run when triggered with specified SSID.\nSurely login form on captive may have another HTML elements. You can add some display dialogs or notifications, another different SSID with it's own HTML elements and username/password. Fake is a browser+automator, so it will make life easier.\nDon't forget to disable captive login popup. Now your Mac 100% autoconnect to the portal.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Update: note that question was asked and answered in 2012, a lot has changed in the OS since that time, including SIP, which prevents the renaming proposed here. The answer below by @cwd is now the recommended way as it doesn't need disabling of SIP...\nYou can rename\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app\n\ninto\n/System/Library/CoreServices/No More Captive Network Assistant.app\n\nand you're all set. Password entering now goes via your browser of choice and can be stored using 1password or other plugins.  Note that if you were already logged in while doing the renaming, it may take some time for your session to expire...\n\nA: Although a few years old this question and answer shows high in googling this. Unfortunately MacOS has changed since then. This page on MacWorld from 2016 seems to describe the current (as of this writing) state.\nWhich essentially is that because of SIP you can disable the assistant only in  recovery mode. I have yet to find any solution to the other part of this question, \"can we automate the login?\"\n\nA: Tyilo's NetworkAutoLogin project on github is an os.x daemon that \"Automagically logs into to Captive Portal Networks\" with user-supplied credentials. \nIt uses PhantomJS & CasperJS to post the necessary info to the fields on the captive portal login page. Could be the secret login \"password\", a username-password pair, or just activating a EULA checkbox and the \"connect\" button.\nI can't remember exactly how it is triggered, but it registers a .plist with launchctl.\nYou put configuration options in a json file, specifying the name of the fieldset (optional) on the captive portal page and the necessary fieldname + content pairs (required). Here's an example of the config file stored in ~/.networkautologin.js\n{ // Example with all possible options\n    match: {\n        SSID: ['Example WiFi 1', 'Example WiFi 2'],\n        BSSID: '01:23:45:67:89:AB',\n        URL: 'http://logon.example.org/?url=http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html'\n    },\n    form_selector: 'form#login_form',\n    fields: {\n        'username': 'test',\n        'password': '123123'\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: A captive portal is not like a password. It's more like a sign in sheet. Every time the network you're connected to hands out an IP address through DHCP, it gives you the captive portal to sign into/agree to and then it allows you to connect. From what I understand, this is a cross platform restriction that cannot be altered. It may be something that the network administrators can change, but even that may depend on the type of equipment being used. \n\nA: You can use Mili, an open-source tool I wrote for auto login hotspot pages. It also works on Linux.\nWhen you change your Wi-Fi connection, Mili checks for Mikrotik services and then attempts to log in with your login information.\nYou can also use multi-login information like this:\n{\n    \"username\": \"USER 1\",\n    \"password\": \"PASS 1\",\n    \"share\": 5\n}, \n{\n    \"username\": \"USER 2\",\n    \"password\": \"PASS 2\",\n    \"share\": 1\n}\n\n", "Q: How can I navigate to individual windows?

Also, I do not prefer to install any paid software and would like to use build in features if possible.\n\nA: To switch between windows of the same application, use ⌘ + ~.\nIf you need a shortcut like the Windows' Alt+Tab that switches between all open windows, you can set one in your System Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts as shown below.\n\nAs you can see above, the default is Ctrl+F4, which actually means you need to press Ctrl+Fn+F4 because of the special meaning of the function keys.

I have created a number of desktops in which to keep Safari, Mail, iCal etc. These are all kept in full-screen mode and I have unchecked the setting to automatically rearrange spaces, yet whenever I restart my Mac the Spaces have changed order. Any ideas why? \n\nA: You have a race condition and the outcome of it is non-deterministic.\nThey desktops get created in the order the programs are full-screened. So first desktop goes to the first application that tells the OS it wants to be full screen and so on. Apparently, when you resume your applications after a restart, they resume windowed and tell the OS that they should be full screen as they where before you shut down. The order in which they tell this to the OS is non-deterministic on every boot. They tell the OS, when they tell the OS, and in no particular order. So your full screen applications appear in random order every time you boot.\nAs of OS X 10.7.2, you can quickly re-order your desktops by bringing up Mission Control and then dragging the windows shown along the top of the screen in to the order you desire. Pre-10.7.2 you have to un-full screen all your applications and then re-full screen them in the order you want them to appear.\n\n", "Q: How do I refresh the devices in Image Capture? For some reason, Image Capture doesn't always update the list of devices after I plug in my iPhone. Sometimes restarting Image Capture works, and sometimes it does not. Does this have to do with the number of images on my iPhone, which is several hundred? The fact that there's a passcode on my iPhone? \nIs there a steady way to make my iPhone appear?\nEdit:\nThe iPhone is indeed visible in iTunes. Connecting via the other USB port makes it visible in Image capture as well - after a wait.\n\nA: If you quit the application and re-start it, that seems to resolve any devices that connect and get missed when you plug them in after the application has launched and enumerated the connected USB devices.\nEven if you have iTunes and Xcode and other apps running, I've not seen Image Capture fail to recognize connected devices if you restart the program and I have certainly seen it miss device connects on occasion when other apps are running and want to talk with an iOS device.\nThat being said, here are things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Different USB ports and cables\n\n*Trust setting on the iOS device (Settings -> Reset -> Reset Location & Privacy.)\n\n*restart either the phone or the Mac or both\n\n*update software on the phone or the Mac or both (iTunes updates install sync software and drivers needed)\n\n*make a new account on the Mac (to test once)  in case image capture or your photo library settings or data are corrupt \n\n\nSee https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202778 for trust issues and iOS. \n\nA: Connecting the device via another USB port (or in my example via USB hub, connected to another port) was the only thing that helped me.\nWhat did not work for me was: \n- Force Quit and restart the Image Capture\n- Restart the computer\n- Opening/using iTunes\n\nA: On my iPhone, I had to go to Settings -> Reset -> Reset Location & Privacy. Once I reset this setting on my phone, I got a prompt on my iPhone asking if I wanted to trust the computer I was connected to. After I tapped the Trust button, all of my photos appeared.\n\nA: a restart worked for me! then restart itunes, disconnect and reconnect phone, open image capture... but when the app is open select \"image capture\" on the drop down far bottom left.\n\nA: It wasn't showing in Image Capture to me. What I was missing was to sync my iTunes and my iPhone (as I has recently upgraded to Yosemite). Syncing both solved the problem to me. Right after, I opened Image Capture again and my iPhone was there and all the photos were showing.\n\nA: My resolution was to quit and reopen the Image Capture application. My iPhone then appeared as a connected device. In Image Capture, I then selected the device from the right sidebar and clicked on the triangle icon at the bottom left of the application's window. I set this to \"No application\" when the iPhone is connected. This way I don't have Image Capture automatically open with the device not appearing there and can choose to open Image Capture as I please after plugging in my phone and it has loaded.\n\nA: I just tried closing iTunes, then closed and reopened image capture and bingo - iPhone showed straight away.  May work for others\n", "Q: How do I transition from a MobileMe account to an existing iCloud account? I'm starting to get more messages about MobileMe ending, but despite all the info people have been posting online, I'm still confused as to how to deal with my own situation.  \nI currently keep all my contacts, calendar, and probably a few other things on MobileMe, and have my devices tied to that account's Find My iDevice function.  \nHowever, I use a different email address for my Apple account (app purchases, Game Center, etc.). I believe I've already created an iCloud account using this email, though I'm not sure if I have anything on it yet.  It seems that Apple really only wants you to have one sign-on for iCloud, the app store, etc., since you can store your purchases there.\nIt sounds like I can't really merge the MobileMe data into my existing Apple/iCloud account.\nIt sounds like some me functionality is going away (ie, not replicated by iCloud functionality).\nWhat do I need to do to keep my calendar and contacts synced across all my computers and devices, and how do I move them from my existing MobileMe account to my existing iCloud account?\nCan I still keep my @me.com email address?  \nDoes iCloud have an email account/address that comes with it?\nIt seems like I should be able to wrap my head around this myself, but it's still unclear.\n\nA: Here is a fantastic article on moving to iCloud. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4918\nAnd, yes, you can keep your current @me.com address. Instead of being associated with MobileMe, @me.com email addresses are now iCloud (and MobileMe user will be migrated over), so the email address that comes with iCloud is @me.com. Again, I believe you are able to keep your current @me.com address.\nUnfortunately, merging wouldn't be possible.\n\nA: Here's the best advice I can provide if going back and re-reading the FAQ doesn't solve your decision making process.\nIf you try signing up for a new iCloud account, and any person has a MobileMe account with the same name - then you will be told the user name is taken. If that old account has expired, then you will need Apple to either release the old accounts (which could happen all together) or get Apple to re-activate it. I could imagine either would be hard to find a lever to accomplish as one person acting alone.\nHowever, if your MobileMe account is still active (which is likely since you are still receiving warning messages), you should plan to migrate the account before it gets too late. \nWhen you migrate, you do lose the ability to sync with older devices (pre-Lion and pre-iOS5) but you have preserved access to the majority of the functions on devices running Lion and iOS5. This need to run recent software is the only drawback to migrating. The rest of the \"not making it to iCloud\" functionality like galleries, iWeb hosting and such will still work until MobileMe expires on June 30, 2012.\n", "Q: Lost keyboard shortcut for beginning-of-line/end-of-line After purchasing a new computer (Mac Mini w/Lion) and migrating my settings from old one (Macbook Pro w/Snow Leopard), the system shortcuts for beginning-of-line and end-of-line text navigation commands (Cmd-left/right arrow) just don't work anymore, anywhere. \nCuriously, this happens only in a single user account, and in other accounts on the same computer it's OK. Other shortcuts with the Command key (like Cmd-up) also work just fine.\nI have browsed through the keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences > Keyboard. I also have KeyRemap4Macbook installed and browsed through its settings, to no avail. There is no Keybindings folder in my ~/Library, either.\nAnybody have any idea how to even start debugging this problem?\n\nA: I remember having the same problem in some apps after upgrading to Lion. A reboot fixed it for me.\nWorkaround: use Ctrl+A (instead of ⌘+←) to move the cursor to the beginning of the line and Ctrl+E to move the cursor to the end of the line (instead of ⌘+→). This works in all Cocoa-based applications.\n\nA: Thanks to the commenter Lri for pointing to this question: Command+right/left stopped working! It made me browse through the system shortcuts again, and lo and behold - Cmd+Left & Cmd+Right were indeed in plain sight as shortcuts for \"Move Left a Space\" and \"Move Right a Space\" - I didn't even look there before because I did not use Spaces at all in Snow Leo, and so I assumed these shortcuts were inactive. Now the upgrade to Lion and Mission Control activated them, but I still had only one space so they did nothing.\nSo it was enough to actually redefine them to something else to regain the beginning/end-of-line functionality.\nSorry everyone for misleading with the wrong information (turns out I did not actually browse through all possible shortcuts...)\n", "Q: How do I build a PC Into a Mac PPC G5 case? How can I convert my (unfortunately) obsolete Mac G5 PPC case into a PC? It only supports Leopard OS-wise and I'd like to keep the beautiful Mac Case and reuse it with PC components inside.\nCan that be done? Can the hardware inside be replaced with a PC motherboard etc?\n\nA: Yes it is possible, and instructions are probably outside the scope of this forum due to the extreme variations and nature of the hardware available.\nBut heres a video of one guy's journey to turning a G5 case into a hackintosh so you can see what is involved before you make the decision.\nAnd another more detailed tale here again not for the faint of heart.\n\nA: The easiest method is to purchase a smaller computer that fits inside.  If you do a google search for \"atom pc\" you'll find a lot of options of reasonably useful machines that will readily fit into the G5 case.  You won't be able to use the original slots for cards, but you should be able to extend SATA cables outside the atom pc to the drives, and attach the power button wire to the correct spot on the atom PC.  You can also extend the USB ports to the outside of the G5 case.\nIt's not ideal, but for a quick hack that's easier than a full PC upgrade, it's cheaper and easier if you merely want the  design aesthetic.\n\nA: To the question regarding whether one put can a PC motherboard in G5 tower: the answer is yes. \nI placed a gigabyte ga-945gcmx-s2 with 6700 intel into the G5 (it was one I took out of a tower I was updating). The G5 was one that I found at a Goodwill store. There was nothing inside except a fried motherboard. It has four 120mm fans which I added. You will have to rewire the switch but the computer now lights up and turns on. It also has a 500w power supply. \nThis is my first attempt at something like this. I am planning to upgrade the processor to i7 next month. By the way, I recommend that you do some planning before doing any cutting. That is something I wish I would have done.\n", "Q: See Installation Status of All App Updates I have so many apps on my iPhone, when I install a batch of updates it takes a while for them to complete.  Given how many different screens my iPhone has, it's difficult to determine when all of the updating apps are done installing.\nIs there a different view/screen I can pull up to track the progress of all apps currently being installed and/or updated?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no feature like this built into iOS. Something may exist with a Jailbreak, but I am not aware of such a tool. \nYou have something 'like' this in the Mac App Store, where the update screen shows the progress itself. \nYou can possibly suggest the feature on Apple's Feedback Page, or submit a bug through Apple's Bug Reporter.\nLuckily, in iOS 5, multiple apps can be downloaded and installed simultaneously, so this should speed up the process, and make it more noticeable. \n\nA: I found that when I go to the home screen and there's no spinning network indicator, then my updates are done.\nI usually hit update all, then go to the main page and watch the little counter on the App Store icon decrement until it disappears (this is so I don't wake my phone later to find the process has halted because one of the apps is rated 17+ because it has a browser).  Then I check it occasionally and wait for the network indicator to stop spinning.\nI also have almost all my apps inside folders on 3 pages, so it doesn't take long to page through each page and look for the progress bar on the folders.  If you have a lot of pages of apps it might take awhile, but put your apps into folders and the folder shows a progress bar that takes all the apps inside it into account for updates, so that can reduce the time you spend looking at app icons to see if an update is still occurring.\n", "Q: What advanced calendar scheduling can Siri do? I just found out that Siri can do complex calendar schedules, such as scheduling something for every three days.  The calendar app has a very limited interface for complex scheduling, so I'm wondering what other calendar scheduling I can do with Siri that I can't do with the regular calendar interface?\nOne thing I'm curious about is whether it can schedule monthly \"first ... of\" repeating events.  For instance, I have a meeting I attend on the second Tuesday of each month.  Can I schedule that using Siri, and what is the best phrasing to use?\n\nA: While I am sure its not a complete list (the only people who would have that would be Apple), here is a list I found on many of the phrases Siri understands:\nAdding Events\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a meeting at 9 \n\n*Set up a meeting with Michael at 9 \n\n*Meet with Lisa at noon \n\n*Set up a meeting about hiring tomorrow at 9am  \n\n*New appointment with Susan Park Friday at 3 \n\n*Schedule a planning meeting at 8:30 today in the boardroom\n\n\nChanging events\n\n\n*\n\n*Move my 3pm meeting to 4:30\n\n*Reschedule my appointment with Dr. Manning to next Monday at 9am\n\n*Add Lisa to my meeting with Jason\n\n*Cancel the budget review meeting\n\n\nAsking about events \n\n\n*\n\n*What does the rest of my day look like?\n\n*What's on my calendar for Friday?\n\n*When is my next appointment?\n\n*When am I meeting with Michael?\n\n*Where is my next meeting?\n\n\nMore available at http://www.iphonehacks.com/2011/10/iphone-4s-features-exhaustive-list-of-phrases-siri-can-understand.html\nI personally have found that many of these features are available through the UI, but so complex or have a confusing workflow that most people wouldn't deal with it (for example, think of how many taps it would take to set a meeting at a time somewhere and invite someone?). For example, in the linked question about every three days, I wonder if it set a repeat that way (which is not available in the UI), or created new independent events. \nAfter seeing your updated question, related directly to recurring monthly events on a certain day-of-week, I could not reliably get this to work. Using a phrase like 'schedule _ for the first Thursday of every month' did prompt for a time, but then tried to create the even for every day. This may work on a month to month basis, as in 'schedule __ for the second Tuesday of April'. I did another test just now, and it actually created a repeating event, but nothing more than a repeating one on the 30th of every month (it said it was creating a new event starting today). This was using the same phrase, and gave obviously different results. \nI am not sure if this was due to a limit of Siri, or the fact that the recurrence options of Calendar on iOS is limited. This feature is easy to do on iCloud.com or in iCal itself. \n\nA: I believe it is only limited by the recurrence rules based on the iCalendar standard. Thus repeating events or reminders like 'the first Tuesday of every month' should be possible but 'the first Tuesday and last Thursday of every month' is theoretically not with just one event because iCalendar doesn't support that recurrence.  The trick is figuring out which keywords trigger Siri to setup the schedule.\n\nA: I have been having issues lately with SIRI giving errors of \"Sorry Tim, I Can't schedule appointments in the past. For example if you ask it to remind you of something the third week of every month, or I even asked it to schedule something for a specific date later this month and it gave the same error. I was pretty sure SIRI could handle something like that, but since it's happening on all my IOS devices, it is not currently capable of that type of request. I have also learned that no matter what, it is definitely not perfect, and many time I just need to do it manually anyway. Hopefully this will improve and one new one I like the looks of very much for more complex questions is called \"Hound\", it's by the folks who make soundhound\n", "Q: How to find a cause of a Kernel Panic message, or BSoD? How to understand why Beautiful Screen of Death1 appeared?\n\nWhen I tried to find what happened using \"Console\" I couldn't find anything useful in logs? There's no 'panic' or 'SIG*' in logs, so what should I look for?\nWhere does OSX writes the cause of it's death?\n\n1 I'm not sure that it's called BSoD on OSX, but it doesn't look like kernel panic screen (black screen in text mode) either.\n\nA: All panic and sleep failure logs are stored in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports since Mojave, in Kernel-%DATE%-.panic files.\n\nA: \nThe kernel panic text is added to the log after you restart the computer, assuming that you did not reset PRAM (the kernel panic text is stored in PRAM until you restart). In Mac OS X v10.6, the logs are located in in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports. In Mac OS X v10.5, the logs are located in /Library/Logs/PanicReporter (source)\n\nIf you cannot find these files, or they contain no information on the kernel panic, then there is likely something wrong with the hardware of the computer.  Running a system diagnostic or visiting the genius bar is probably your next step.\nIf you are really interested in attempting to resolve the issue yourself, you might find this guide to resolving OS X kernel panics helpful.\n\nA: It is indeed a kernel panic, the default behaviour is to display this screen rather than printing anything useful unfortunately.\nIf there's nothing in the system logs in console, then you can try booting your Mac in verbose mode. Hold Cmd + V while powering it on, you'll know when you get it right when loads of text gets written to screen instead of the normal spinning indicator.\nVerbose mode causes kernel panics to log information to the screen rather than just showing the \"you need to restart your computer\" instruction. If you get another panic this should at least give you more specific details about the problem.\nApple's official troubleshooting guidelines recommend a safe boot and then a reboot. That support page also includes advanced troubleshooting information such as the location of the panic logs.\n\nA: The cause of a kernel panic can be found in the appreciate report logs and core dumps. \nThe location of kernel panic log can be found at /Library/Logs/panic.log on your startup disk.\nSource: Retrieve Kernel Panic Log.\nCores dump (if enabled), can be located at /cores.\nSee: Where are core dumps written on Mac?\nSee also: Technical Note TN2118 about Kernel Core Dumps.\n", "Q: How to setup FTP server in Mac OS X Lion Server?

The whole instruction set is on the blog post referenced or just look at both posts. If someone wants me to duplicate that other post here let me know.\nGetting in is one thing. Now you have to mount the folder you want to use. Unfortunately you can't use a symlink inside of a chroot jail. This is where MacPorts is your best friend. I don't know why I've never seen fit to install this before. After installation just issue the following commands.\nsudo port install fuse4x\nsudo port install fuse4x bindfs\n\nYou might have to restart. Now with an empty folder created in /chroot/user you can mount --bind to a folder outside of the chroot jail. For example\nsudo /opt/local/bin/bindfs -u user /Library/WebServer/Documents/mysite/yourfolder /chroot/user/scratchpad\n\nSo far this seems to work here.\n", "Q: Do 64gb and 128gb SDXC cards work on the Macbook Air 2011? I'm considering getting a SDXC card to extend the drive space of my Macbook Air. I just want to make sure both the 64 GB and 128 GB SDXC cards work on the 2011 Macbook Air.\n\nA: It appears to work according to several reports:\nhttp://www.zdnet.co.uk/reviews/ultraportables/2011/07/26/apple-macbook-air-2011-133in-40093522/\n\nThere has been some concern that Apple lists the MacBook Pro models on\n  its web site as having an SDXC card slot, for high-capacity SD cards,\n  and only lists the card reader on the Air as an SD card one. We tried\n  a 64GB SanDisk SDXC card in the MacBook Air's card reader, and the\n  system recognised it as the appropriate size and was able to access\n  files on it. However, if you're looking to get a massive SD card in\n  order to augment the smallish 128GB SSD built into the Air, note that\n  the card slot leaves the SD card hanging halfway out on the side of\n  the system, so it's not appropriate for full-time use.\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3014714?start=0&tstart=0\n\nI got my Transcend SDXC 64GB flash card, and yes, it reads and writes\n  perfectly in my MacBook Air.\n\nAccording to iFixit it uses the Gensys logic GL822 SD slot controller which is a USB 2.0 high speed device (480mbps) and supports up to 2TB SDXC cards.\n\nA: According to this discussion thread on Apple's forums, both 64 and 128 GB SDXC cards are well supported on the latest [mid-2011 at the time of writing] MBA, provided you format them using the Mac OS X Journaled option.\n\nA: My mid-2011 MacBook Air recognizes and uses a Komputerbay 64 GB SDXC card just fine. It's a $54 card from Amazon. However, I only get read speeds around 33 MB/s from this card.\nthe card reader is on a USB 2 bus so it will never be all that fast.  As some point they put the card reader on a ?pci-e? bus and it has higher possible speed.\n", "Q: How can I prevent my Macbook Pro 2011 from going to sleep when I close the lid? This is not a duplicate of this question as it does not work: Is there any way to set a MacBook Pro to not sleep when you close the lid?\nI have a Macbook Pro 2011. I want to be able to close the lid without the Macbook Pro going into sleep mode. It seems InsomniaX is not doing anything. I've seen people with MacBook Air having the same problem.\nDoes anyone have an alternative suggestion for that?\nUPDATE: I forgot to mention that I close the lid but I have a Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter plugged in that displays something on an external monitor. I want to close the lid and still be able to view to video that is playing on this external monitor.\n\nA: The laptop will automatically go to the default sleep mode when closed unless it is plugged into power. Once plugged in, you will be able to run it to the monitor, wireless mouse, etc.\n\nA: If you're running OS X Lion, you need you use...\nInsomniaX 2\nThe other post only refers to InsomniaX 1 - which does not work in Lion.\n\nA: In my experience with my early 2011 MacBook Pro, it has to be plugged in to power (charging) for it to send anything through the thunderbolt port, even with external mouse/keyboard. Caffeine  seems to work for me for keeping my MacBook Pro awake when plugged in to power and external monitor.\n\nA: You don't need to install software to prevent sleep. Simply open a terminal and enter\npmset noidle\n\nIf that is tedious to remember you can create an alias to it by appending your ~/.bash_profile with\nalias nosleep='pmset noidle'\n\nyou can then prevent sleep with nosleep\nTo exit out of the no sleep mode hit control c in the terminal and stuff goes back to normal.\n\nA: Another choice, if InsomniaX does not meet your needs, is NoSleep. I've used it for several years without issue, and it provides for separate settings for powered vs. battery.\n", "Q: Moving mobile sync to home laptop My iPod Touch is synced to my work Mac. My iPad is synced to my home laptop. I want to move the Touch sync/backup to the laptop. If I copy the latest Touch Mobile Sync backup to the laptop will it clash/interfere with the iPad backup? I don't care about music just apps and preferences. I realize they're different numbers in the file name but is that enough to distinguish them?\n\nA: You can back up as many iDevices to your computer as you please (technically). On my computer, I sync and have backed up at least three different iDevices.\nAll you need to do, is plug in your iPod Touch to your laptop, open iTunes, and back it up. It will know the difference between your iPod touch and iPad.\nThe difference comes in if you sync music from a computer (but that isn't relavent to this question, so I won't elaborate).\n", "Q: accidentally deleted entire iTunes Match music library - is there a way to recover? I'm slightly panicking here.\nI don't keep local copies of songs in my iTunes library, instead streaming them on demand via iTunes Match, to save space on the SSD drive.\nIn certain situations such as buying music from a source different than iTunes, or if i decide to download an album for listening locally, the songs end up on my disc. So whenever i feel like it, i select all the music in the library and hit delete in order to delete the local files. My music is still stored on Apple's servers.\nToday though, in a hurry, i must have hit the wrong button which, in a blink, deleted my entire library from iTunes Match. It disappeared from my iOS devices and from iTunes on my Mac without a trace. Gone. Help! is there a way to undo this step?\nI should add, ~99% of my collection is not bought through iTunes, so it's not a matter of re-downloading previous purchases.\nupdate: okay, shortly before this incident, i was adding an album to iTunes in ALAC format which i had reencoded from FLACs bought from boomkat.com - this was \"exotic\" music not available from iTunes, and the Match status said \"uploaded\" from all tracks. Now, when i added these same files again to my freshly wiped library, it didn't upload them. Sure enough, the status says \"uploaded\", but the process took like 2 seconds. The files were definitely cached on Apple's server, so I still have a little hope..\n\nA: Unfortunately, iTunes Match really isn't made to be a backup service in this way, and it can be really easy to loose stuff if you don't have other means of recovering it.\nFor those songs you purchased from iTunes, you should be able to still see them in the purchased list in the iTunes store, and re-add them to your library. Many other sources, like Amazon, will also allow you to re-download their files.\nIf you had a Time Machine backup, maybe your old library is stored there as well?\nIf you happen to have an iPod, and had any music synced to it, you could actually use that as a 'backup' and pull your songs from there using an application like iRip. This would only work though if you had a device with the files actually on there, as in a iPod classic or nano, or an iOS device you had downloaded music too.\nFinally, you MAY be able to contact Apple Support and see if they have any way of helping, but this may take a very long time and not actually produce anything. I have had a hard time getting support on anything with Match, so replacing an entire library may even be harder. I would recommend calling them if possible. \n\nA: I had this same problem. I had accidentally deleted all of the music off my iTunes library. \nThis website, if you are using a mac, gives an easy way to recover your library. This sadly only works if you have made no changes to your library since you deleted everything and I'm guessing you have because you posted this in march. \n", "Q: Quitting and reopening Mail loses all accounts Every time I quite Mail or reboot my computer, all of my mail accounts are gone and I'm prompted to reconfigure my accounts (6 of them).\nThis is incredibly annoying and I'm not sure where I've gone wrong.\nWhat I have tried id deleting the plist file in ~/Library/Preferences/ and recreating from scratch, but the same crap still applies.

Apple stores print receipts from their iPod touch credit card readers.  They probably use a custom solution with a server backend.\nSquare has a few wireless receipt printers it can work with.\nI haven't yet seen a receipt printer that is airprint compatible though, allowing more apps to use it.  While credit card acceptance and sales apps would obviously benefit, I can imagine a number of other uses for a small printer that prints bits of disposable information.  The daily forecast, sudoku puzzles, today's schedule, todo lists, etc, for those who have to share their iPad with a spouse or children, for instance.\nAre there air print receipt printers, or is there an easy way to set up a receipt printer, perhaps with an airprint server (device or software on the mac) that would allow this?\n\nA: The Apple Store doesn’t list any AirPrint-compatible receipt printers.\nHowever, the AirPrint Activator (an app for your Mac) allows you to use any shared printer via AirPrint.\n\nA: Most receipt printers I have seen use a wired ethernet connection, so you could add a slick Lantronix xPrintServer which uses AirPrint to avoid needing a computer running for your iOS devices to print to these specialized printers.\nImage from the vendor site linked above\nThere are several reviews of this product, and the unit is physically about the size of three iPhone 4 stacked in a neat pile. It is intended to support between 7 and 10 printers before you need to buy a second device. I am not clear whether you can set this up from iOS, but it works well once you have it set up.\nThe day will come when label printers ship with wireless chips and AirPrint embedded, but that day is not yet here.\n\nA: By adding something like atBox, you could send the PDF to an email account which in turn sends it to a selected printer.

But right below it, its now saying new-host-3.home as well. \n\nThis also appears that it would then be on two domains - .local and .home. \nHow do I correct this? If I change the computer name, it won't change this. \n\nA: Unfortunately the computer name and host name can get out of sync.  Open a terminal window and use\nsudo hostname <new hostname>\n\nto change the hostname.  Once executed, it changes the system configuration, so the new hostname will be there when you reboot.\nAlso, be aware that some DHCP servers will assign a hostname.  Depending on the network you attach to and the DHCP server configuration you may have to work with the network administrator if you need to use a different hostname.  You don't have to worry about this for most consumer grade routers.\n", "Q: How to Change File Type Associations?

I back up to an external NAS drive with 2 partitions, one using time machine and the other superduper to make a bootable copy of my mac.\nI would like to encrypt the data on there but from what I've read I will need to move the data, format the drive and then move the data back. \nDoes anyone know another way to do this? or software that will enable this? \n\nA: What you are looking for is encrypting a drive \"in place\".  Some software packages do provide this, however you can also do this with Lion's built-in whole disk encryption, which you have to enable via the terminal, since the diskutility does not expose this functionality.  It was intended only to encrypt the main OS disk in place, but is available if you need to do it by hand for other volumes.\nInstructions can be found here:\nhttp://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1935/lions-whole-disk-encryption\nExcerpt:\n\nTo convert an arbitrary volume to Lion’s whole-disk encryption, you\n  use diskutil’s core storage “convert” command, and provide a\n  passphrase. For example, if you have a volume called “Data” attached\n  to your Mac, you would run something like this from the command line:\n% diskutil cs convert /Volumes/Data -passphrase [yourPasswordHere]\n\nWhat this does is kicks off a conversion process similar to what the\n  System Preferences panel does when allowing you to convert your main\n  startup volume to core storage with encryption. At any time during the\n  conversion, you can use the diskutil command again to see status of\n  your volumes, whether they are encrypted, not encrypted, or\n  in-progress while converting.\n% diskutil cs list\n\nYou’ll see a bunch of information, but search carefully for the named\n  volume (e.g. “Data”) that you just started the conversion process on.\n  You’ll find a line starting with something like:\nSize (Converted):\n\nThis shows you what the progress in the conversion is. From time to\n  time, check this manually, to see how far along things have\n  progressed.\n\nI'm not sure that this will work on a network volume.  If not, check out TruCrypt carefully.  It allows in place encryption of non-system windows volumes, and so it may have the same functionality for OS X volumes.  Otherwise, the google search (first link in this answer) does bring up some other options.\n\nA: Yes - this is how FileVault works on Lion with DAS storage drives. It encrypts data in place. The downside is you can't use that drive with older Apple OS and non Apple OS.\nIt's not clear if this works for arbitrary NAS - but I have tried it on TimeCapsule to ask TimeMachine to encrypt the data and it seems to be safely locked away from my basic testing. I can't tell if this encryption is whole drive or just per image and can try to test that later this weekend and update things if no-one else knows that aspect.\n\nA: I'm not sure when this feature was added, but Apple has extended its in-place encryption to external drives. To use it - right click the drive in Finder and select \"Encrypt\" from the drop down menu. It will prompt for a password and begin encrypting. There is no special progress bar for it. But if you right click on the drive again it will tell you if it is currently encrypting. I'm not sure of the drive requirements to do this. My drive was formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n", "Q: What is the difference between .m3u8 and .m3u playlists types? iTunes will export a few different kinds of playlists, including .m3u8 and .m3u types.

(.m3u files can have various encodings.)\n", "Q: Using FaceTime without the video I have a first generation MacBook Air that heats up a lot when playing videos, and almost grinds to a halt after a few minutes of playback.\nIs there a way I could turn off the video during FaceTime calls so that the audio could continue smoothly?\n\nA: All reports seem to indicate that there is no way to use facetime on the mac without video.  You can continue a facetime call audio-only on iOS devices by pressing the home button, but oddly enough you can't disable video for the mac.\nOne suggestion I read awhile ago for low end machine was to place a piece of black paper over the camera.  It takes much less processing power to encode a static image of mostly black than your face.\nMinimizing the window will disable the video reception decoding, and may save you some processing power.  Taping over your camera and minimizing the window might give you enough processing power back to use audio comfortably.\nYou might also consider skype or google voice if all you need is audio.\n\nA: Yes — if you simply minimize the FaceTime window (⌘ Command+M) or hide FaceTime (⌘ Command+H), video will pause while audio still functions as usual.\n(Similarly, on iOS, pressing the home button will pause video and allow you to use other applications while audio still works.)\n\nA: If you are having trouble with heat due to video processing through FaceTime, you should look at alternatives for your Mac. It is not just the video you are sending but also the video you are receiving that is causing your processor to overheat.\nPerhaps if you were to use skype you would have lees issues during calls, as you do not need to share video. \nSkype is available on all devices that FaceTime is available for with the added benefit that you can call non Mac and iOS users including Windows 7 PC, Windows Mobile, Android and the link. See it as a more compatible solution.\n\nA: I discovered a simple hack. If you use Google Hangouts, while in hangouts you can turn the camera off (standard feature). This switches off the camera globally. Even after you've closed the Hangouts browser, next time you go into FaceTime, the camera remains switched off with a message \"No camera available. To use FaceTime turn on the camera.\" \n\nA: Depending on if you were planning to use your Mac for other purposes during the call, you can always just dim your screen all the way off. That's what I do while I'm out the country!\n", "Q: I installed Xcode but I still don't have gcc in my terminal I just got a Mac and I'm a complete newbie, so this may be kind of a really easy question, but I wasn't able to solve it with Google or F1.  \nI was trying to run a C program from the Terminal that comes with mac, but when I used gcc test.c, it said -bash:  gcc:  command not found.  I looked up the error on Google and discovered that I needed to download Xcode.  I did that and installed it (I think, after all it runs), but I still don't have gcc in my Terminal.  What can I do?\n\nA: If the command-line tools are all you need and you don’t really need Xcode, then there’s a much more efficient way to install these tools that doesn’t require you to download multiple gigabytes of data.\nSimply download the “Command Line Tools” package from Apple Developer (free account required; you can use your Apple ID). As of this writing, the package is named “Command Line Tools for Xcode - Late March 2012”. It’s a 171.70 MB disk image, which pales in contrast to the 4+ GB Xcode download.\nNote that, if you’ve already installed Xcode, you’ll want to uninstall it before installing the Command Line Tools.\n\nA: Great question — this recently changed, so I suspect many other people are wondering the same thing.\nIn the latest version of Xcode, the command line tools are distributed as a separate package. Luckily they're very easy to install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Xcode, and open the Preferences window (⌘+,).\n\n*Switch to the Downloads tab.\n\n*Click \"Install\" (or \"Update\") next to \"Command Line Tools\". You can also configure automatic updates, and additional Xcode components.\n\n\nNote: since these tools are actually a completely separate package, you can install the command line tools without installing Xcode, if you don't need Xcode and want to save some disk space. They can be downloaded separately from the Apple developer site.\n\n\nA: This is the expected behaviour, Xcode now uses LLVM as the default compiler. Starting with Xcode 4.3 gcc is not included anymore, distributed builds is not available anymore either.\nIf you want gcc you will have to download the separate package named \"Command Line Tools for Xcode\" from Xcode as described in this answer.\n", "Q: Where can I find software for the Mac Classic? I just found a really great application: Mini vMac, a Mac Classic emulator (simple and one that actually works). Is there a place where I can find some actual software that was meant for the original Macintosh? I think someone I know might have some boxes of floppies, so would it be possible to copy files off of them? I don't want modern software that was made for emulators. Would the Apple website have some hidden like how they have old System 6+ downloads?\n\nA: Apple's website has a page dedicated to Older Software Downloads for systems earlier than 8.1.\n(They also still have a support page for OS 9, but the Downloads link on this page just links to the current OS X downloads page.)\n\nA: In addition to AppleCare's Older Software Downloads list, there are a few other sites that host old Macintosh software, including Software for Classic Macs and Info-Mac Archive.\nWikipedia's list of old Macintosh software should also help you get names of specific applications.\n\nA: Macintosh Garden is another good source.\n\nA: You can download System 6, System 7 and MacOS 8 and 9 from my ftp server hosted on a 1992 Mac LCII running system 7.0.1:\nftp://oldservers.ddns.net/\n\nA: And a few classic games: Cliff Johnson's game site\n", "Q: Why does iPhone Maps app sometimes ask to enable Wi-Fi for \"accuracy\", even though Location Services (GPS) is enabled? Background:\nI have an iPhone 3GS with iOS 5.1, and a 3G data plan that I keep enabled. I also keep \"Location Services\" (GPS) always on, since I use applications that take advantage of it.\nHowever, I make a point of keeping Wi-Fi turned off because it's a battery sucker and I seldom use the phone within range of a base-station for which I'd be authorized – and I dislike the practice of hopping onto unsecured \"free\" networks, even briefly.\nScenario:\nSometimes when I need to look up an address or directions I use the Maps app.  When I launch the app for the first time in what seems a while, I see a dialog telling me I should \"enable Wi-Fi to improve accuracy\".\nI forget the exact text for the dialog, but that's the general message and the buttons are \"OK\" and \"Settings\". (\"OK\" apparently meaning \"I get it, now go away\", as opposed to \"OK, enable it.\")  I find the dialog both irritating, and puzzling.  When I dismiss it, I still get an accurate location, far as I can tell!\nSo I'd like to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is it that Maps is telling me the location accuracy would be improved with Wi-Fi enabled?  Is there some problem with GPS that Wi-Fi can somehow compensate for?  I fail to see how this would be helpful.  Isn't GPS accurate enough?\n\n*In terms of dealing with the annoyance: Is there a way for me to silence that dialog once and for all?  I dislike continuing to acknowledge something I've been informed of dozens of times already.\nThanks!\n\nA: Hybrid positioning system (XPS)\n\n\n*\n\n*A-GPS (Assisted GPS) is  a method of localization where both GPS and cellular towers are used (cell-site triangulation) for improved accuracy.\n\n*WPS (Wi-Fi Positioning System) is when you use Wi-Fi network identification for localization.\n\n*Hybrid positioning system (XPS) is the combination of both A-GPS and WPS.\nUsing this combination you achieve maximum accuracy in both rural and densely populated areas.\nWikipedia on hybrid positioning:\n\nHybrid positioning systems are systems for finding the location of a mobile device using several different positioning technologies. Usually GPS (Global Positioning System) is one major component of such systems, combined with cell tower signals, wireless internet signals, Bluetooth sensors or other local Positioning Systems.\n\n\nHere's a comparison of the performance of different localization services:\n\n[source]\n\nA: If you haven't used GPS for awhile, the GPS chipset won't have a current GPS almanac and ephemeris information.  It takes up to a minute to gather enough of that information from the data the GPS satellites are sending to get a good fix, and it takes longer to collect a complete almanac and ephemeris information.\nIf the device can narrow its location down to a few hundred feet then it can send that information to Apple's servers and they can generate enough of that information to get the GPS chipset to lock on to the satellites much more quickly.  This is often referred to as \"assisted GPS,\" although that title is relatively misleading in many ways.\nIn theory it would be able to get that information from nearby cell towers, but historically iPhone ran on GSM, which had poor tower positioning capabilities when the iPhone first came out.  Apple decided to go with wifi positioning primarily, and cell tower positioning secondarily.\nSo yes, you will receive a better position faster if you are near a wifi hotspot that apple has mapped (and due to its data collection program it's got a lot of wifi signals mapped) if you enable wifi.\nI do not believe there's a way to disable the alert requesting you turn on your wifi.\n\nA: Per Apple Support:\n\nImproving GPS Accuracy\nGPS accuracy varies depending on the number of visible GPS satellites.\n  Locating all visible satellites can take several minutes, with\n  accuracy gradually increasing over time. Use these tips to improve GPS\n  accuracy:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Ensure the date, time, and timezone are correctly set on the device in\n  Settings > General > Date & Time. If possible, use \"Set\n  Automatically\". Important: Incorrect settings on your computer can\n  sync to your device. Verify the date, time, and timezone on any\n  computer that syncs with your device. \n  \n*Verify that you have a cellular\n  or Wi-Fi network connection. This allows the Assisted GPS (A-GPS) on\n  the device to locate visible GPS satellites faster, in addition to\n  providing initial location information using the Wi-Fi or cellular\n  networks. Note: Microcells (sometimes called Femtocells) are not\n  supported with Location Services. \n  \n*Maintain a clear view of the horizon\n  in several directions. Keep in mind that walls, vehicle roofs, tall\n  buildings, mountains, and other obstructions can block line of sight\n  to GPS satellites. When this occurs, your device will automatically\n  use Wi-Fi or cellular networks to determine your position, until the\n  GPS satellites are visible again.\nCrowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cellular Location Services\nIf Location Services is on, your device will periodically send the\n  geo-tagged locations of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers in an\n  anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to augment the crowd-sourced\n  database of Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations. In addition, if\n  you are traveling (for example, in a car) and Location Services is on,\n  a GPS-enabled iOS device will also periodically send GPS locations and\n  travel speed information in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple,\n  to be used for building up a crowd-sourced road traffic database. The\n  crowd-sourced location data gathered by Apple does not personally\n  identify you.\n\nIn short, iOS uses crowd-sourced Wi-Fi in Apple's database to help fine-tune GPS measurements.\n\nA: The iPhone uses assisted GPS to improve the accuracy of the location system using GPS and cell towers. Wi-Fi networks are used to help determine the device's location; this is called a hybrid positioning system (XPS).\nPrior to iOS 4 iOS tapped into the Skyhook Wireless database of Wi-Fi hotspots and their locations. Apple disclosed in April 2010 that they had switched over to their own proprietary database.\n\nIf Location Services is on, your device will periodically send the geo-tagged locations of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to augment the crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations. In addition, if you are traveling (for example, in a car) and Location Services is on, a GPS-enabled iOS device will also periodically send GPS locations and travel speed information in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to be used for building up a crowd-sourced road traffic database. The crowd-sourced location data gathered by Apple does not personally identify you.\n\nFor your security concerns, read this Apple press release.\n\nA: The iPhone and iOS in general implements a hybrid GPS which relies on a database of known WiFi spots to pinpoint the user's location faster than with GPS and for added accuracy when conditions for GPS are not optimal (area with high buildings, indoors...).\nThis database is built from anonymous data collected by iOS devices. \nWhile Apple used to rely on Skyhook for their WiFi location database they now are using their own according to this article.\n\nAccording to the response by Apple lead counsel Bruce Sewell, Apple does collect anonymous location data from iPhones in an effort to improve its own database of cell tower and WiFi hotspot locations. Devices running iOS versions older than 3.2 still rely on the databases from Google and Skyhook for these locations...\n\n\nA: I don't have much more than anecdotal evidence to back this up, but I'm fairly certain the WiFi is also used to assist Apple's Region Monitoring feature.\nThere's a post in the developer forums (I can't find the link, and I think you might need a developer account to access it anyways) from an Apple employee in late 2010 or early 2011 that indicates region monitoring is based only on cell towers (not the hardware GPS).\nWe were having an issue today in an app we're testing where regions weren't being picked up by a particular phone.  Then we realized it was the only phone with WiFi turned off (the others were on, but \"Not connected\").  When we turned the WiFi on, suddenly it started picking up everything.\nAs such, if you intend to use apps like Banjo, Highlight, or anything using Geoloqi, I'd suggest turning your WiFi on for a better experience.\n", "Q: A utility for tuning your WiFi network? Is there an app available to help tune Wi-Fi network settings?\nMy local air space is starting to get congested and I want to make sure I'm using the optimal channel and settings on my router to avoid collisions and keep my WiFi as speedy as possible. I'm looking to run it on a 2010 MacBook Pro that supports up to Wireless N but I'd like to be able to tune the N and G protocols on my router (a D-Link DIR-655).\n\nA: Netspot\n\nYou can use netspot to basically create a 'map' of your location, and see network information around you. It will show you areas that network connectivity may suffer. You can then revisit the data points to possibly determine better locations for your router, or where the worst offending networks are to better decide which channels to use.\n\nA: iStumbler\niStumbler is an application that shows nearby Wi-Fi networks along with lots of useful diagnostic information (such as signal strength and noise). It doesn't seem to have any built-in optimization tools, but it should get you started with some information.\n\nList of features:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Lists visible wireless networks with complete information.\n  \n*Inspector shows detailed information including a high-resolution graph, notes, extended properties and samples.\n  \n*Always displays the connected network, even if it's private.\n  \n*Graphically indicates network type and encryption status.\n  \n*Signal and noise graphed over time for the selected network.\n  \n*Connection monitor for connected network.\n  \n\nWi-Fi menu extra\nIf you hold down ⌥ Option while clicking on the Wi-Fi menu item, you can see some more information about the Wi-Fi network you're connected to and others (hover over other networks to see information about them.)\n\n\nA: Apple has beefed up the Wireless Diagnostic tool to help perform the most important checks for most consumers:\n\n\n*\n\n*graph signal to noise ratio\n\n*show TxRate negotiated between the chipset and base station\n\n*suggest optimal channels\n\n*perform a scan of open and visible base stations\n\n\n\nYou can also perform packet captures and collect some very nice logs in one file for analysis of conditions over time. I find a weekly check useful for problem sites or active work and also like to keep a diagnostic snapshot of the conditions when I place a new router in service. Also, the airport command line binary might be useful if you wanted to script some aspects of the data collection.\n", "Q: OS X Lion behaving oddly after upgrading to 16GB RAM Just upgraded Early 2011 Macbook Pro w/ 4GB RAM to 16GB RAM. System now sometimes runs smoothly and other times pauses frequently. \nTerminal keeps giving me 'System is low on disk space/memory' error. I have 12GB free disk space and 16GB RAM for God's sake. Activity Monitor says I got 10GB RAM free. So why is it saying I'm low on disk space? Lion also says sometimes that I'm low on disk space. \nThis often happens when spotlight finishes indexing, I guess then system think it's low on disk space (even though I have 9 gb free at that point), then it appears that spotlight trashes its index, systems becomes smooth again, spotlight re-indexes, and same thing happens again. \nMy theory so far is that if I have 16GB RAM, then the OS is for some reason trying to reserve atleast 16GB Swap Space on disk 'just in case I run out of the 16GB RAM'. \nIs this true? Does this make sense? \nI really don't want to free up more hard drive space. I already have a 128GB SSD which is small enough as is, and 16GB RAM should be plenty enough for the OS' memory needs. \nThoughts? \nThanks!\n\nA: I got the \"System is low on disk space/memory\" error as well as a number of other intermittent problems when I upgraded my original apple memory.  It turned out to be either bad memory, or marginal timing specs.\nStartup disk has no more space available for application memory?\nWhen I put the original memory back in, the problems went away - so try that if you've exhausted your other options.\nI did eventually do a little more research and found a 16GB set that very closely matched Apple specs for my early 2011 macbook pro 17 memory, and it's had no problems for several months now.\nI suggest trying out the original apple memory and seeing if the problem goes away.  If it does, return the memory you have, and see if you can get a different set that works better.\n\nA: I looked into it some more and what my OS is trying to do is create the sleepimage file. This file I believe is being used for hibernation, even though I'm not trying to hibernate at the moment. Maybe Lion is trying to be smart and have that file created beforehand so that just in case I want to hibernate/sleep it can do that quickly. \nSo it kind of makes sense that 16gb of RAM would require 16gb of disk space, if you want Lion's safe sleep feature. So options are to either disable this feature or live with 16gb of your hardrive being taken up for this feature. \nI called Mushkin support (the makers of my memory), they weren't very useful but said 'I was on the right track', lol. \nI'll run some memory tests and look into how this safe sleep features works some more. But for now, I think this is the cause of this problem. I think the memory is fine. \nIf people think otherwise though and that this is not normal behavior of OSX, let me know!\n\nA: The first step in troubleshooting is to shut the computer down and unplug the external power, remove all the new RAM, and replace the old RAM in the same configuration before the trouble started. \nThen see if the trouble goes away. If it does go away, then your RAM is either the wrong specification or it is the right specification but is defective.\nI always check specifications with Other World Computing, who specialize in RAM upgrades for Macintoshes.\n", "Q: How can I get the iPhone to \"forget\" certain words? The auto-complete features can be nice, but somewhere along the line my iPhone has learned some questionable language.  How can I get the iPhone to \"forget\" certain words from its auto-complete settings / dictionary?\n\nA: I opened notes, typed the word I wanted and when the incorrect autocorrect showed I pressed the cross. I pressed space bar and repeated the process 8 times. On the 9th time the incorrect suggestion stopped showing. Now it doesn't suggest the incorrect word anywhere!\n\nA: Go to Settings--General--Keyboard--Add New Shortcut\nPut the CORRECT word in the phrase spot and the misspelled word in Shortcut spot.  Every time you type the word the phone wants to autocorrect with the misspelled word, it will automatically default to the CORRECT spelling!  It doesn't remove the word from the dictionary, but it beats the phone at its own game!\n\nA: You can either erase all learned words by going to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary, or you can have your iPhone automatically censor out bad language that you type. To do the latter, go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Edit. You can then set a \"censor\" for bad language. What you could do is create a new shortcut for when you type the Phrase \"cheese\", it'll automatically Shortcut to \"ch***e.\"\n\nA: The easiest way is to reset the keyboard dictionary:\nSettings → General → Reset → Reset Keyboard Dictionary\n\nA: Short of a reset (as the other answers mentioned) or jail breaking, you can't :-(\nThere are a lot of tips to tuning it in this GigaOm article (including the name of the file to edit if you do jailbreak).\nYou can tune it by typing a word and insisting it is correct, you can add a word manually Through a somewhat hidden feature in international keyboard settings, but annoyingly the only way to make it forget is to forget everything.\n\nA: It sounds like it used to be possible to manually edit the user dictionary, but unfortunately it isn't anymore.\nJust a guess, but perhaps you can have it forget them the same way it learned them — when it suggests the word, try tapping on the small [x] next to the suggestion. If you do this a few times it may \"forget\" the word.\n\nYou can reset the dictionary entirely by going to Settings > General > Reset:\n\n\nA: For completeness, there's also this option which will make it not replace any words:\nTurn off Auto-Correction:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Settings app\n\n*Go to General > Keyboard\n\n*Turn off Auto-Correction\n\nA: Found a solution to this. Opened notes, and commenced meeting in a word.  Words I do not want appear on the banner above the keyboard. Just press and hold those words and you will be invited to remove the word from the dictionary.\n\nA: I had an issue where every time I typed the name \"Larissa\" it would capitalize it to \"LARISSA\". No matter how many times I hit the \"X\" next to the suggestion, the thing just would not go away.\nI discovered that I had a contact in my address book with the surname \"LARISSA\" (capitalized), and it was using this contact to make the correction automatically. As soon as I adjusted the contact, it no longer forced this capitalization.\nIt's possibly a rare case, but hope it helps someone else out there.\n(Using iOS 9.3)\n\nA: In more recent versions of iOS, this process has changed. To remove a specific incorrect autocorrect suggestion, long-click on the incorrect suggestion, click \"Stop suggesting\", then--this is important--click the right suggestion. From my testing it appears as though the incorrect suggestion is not actually removed until you tell it the correct suggestion.\n\n\n\n\nA: Keyboard was capitalising a name. I tried resetting the keyboard in settings but that didn’t work. Found it capitalised in contacts. As soon as I corrected it in contacts it stopped suggesting it.\n\nA: You can create a keyboard shortcut. Settings>General>Keybord>Text Replacement. This may work for a word or phrase you use frequently.  This may help in reprogramming the dictionary. It's an indirect way to edit the spell check function. \n\nA: add another English keyboard (e.g Canada / UK) and voilá \n", "Q: iPad app for collecting door-to-door survey information? I need to be able to develop a custom form so I can have workers go door to door and collect survey information.  Think census workers, but geared towards the upcoming election.\nWhile I could develop a custom app, I expect to have to customize it heavily for each area, and make changes to the forms throughout the process.\nIn order to control costs we're not going with 3G service, so all the form data has to be collected on the device and saved until it's uploaded via wifi network (or any other method) later.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any apps that let me design my own custom fields for form entry, and save the data on the device?  \n\n*Simple database apps with custom forms or similar?\n\n\nIf I had my wishlist, it would also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically download the latest collected data when in range of a network.\n\n*Update a standard database server directly (MS SQL, Oracle, MySQL, other?).\n\n*Track the location the info was collected (difficult and imprecise, probably, since it's a wifi tablet only)\n\n*Allow hundreds of tablets to check in and upload to the central server at any time, including simultaneously\n\n*Prompts the survey recorder with a script - not just a form, but gives them what to say, what to ask, and leads them through a configurable tree of questions, some of which depend on previous questions answered.  For instance once they indicate their political affiliation, it might skip questions not appropriate to save time.\n\n\nA: You could use Bento for iPad. It allows you to create custom databases with great looking entry screens. It will also store information on the device until you sync it again. \n\n\nA: The apps from FileMaker sound like they would be good candidates:\nBento (iPad & iPhone)\n\nUse standalone or synchronize with Bento for Mac.

I'm looking to replace my aging DIR-655 and the new DIR-857 looks appealing. This C-Net review has this to say about the USB port on the device:\n\nSharePort is a useful feature of D-Link USB-equipped routers that enables the router to support any USB device as though it were connected to a network computer directly. Over time this technology has evolved from allowing only one computer to access the connected USB device at a time, to multiple access, and now, the ability to share data via the internet.\n\nBut I'm having a hard time finding any concrete details on how that port works and what it really supports. D-Link's product page is lean and so is their brochure.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I connect a drive array to this port such that multiple Macs in my network can do their remote Time Machine backups to that attached storage space?\n\n*Will it handle a HFS+ formatted file system?\nAnd as a bonus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will it handle a Drobo?\n\n\nI know none of the above is possible with the DIR-655 I have now.\nSome clarifying points:\n\n\n*\n\n*I realize I could do this with a TimeCapsule but I have all the disk on hand already with the Drobo and I happen to really like the features of the D-Link firmware (see my comments in Kyle's answer below for details)\n\n*Daniel Beck has found out that the SharePort software does work on Mac, but is it Time Machine friendly? There are non-Apple, remote storage devices that do support Time Machine (see this ReadyNAS FAQ for example) so is this similarly blessed and compatible?\n\nA: Product description\nAccording to the datasheet, it looks like this device's share functionality does not work with Macs at all, since you need to install a driver to get USB-via-Ethernet support. From the footer of the last page of the PDF you link to:\n\nMinimum System Requirements\nComputer with:\n\n*\n\n*Windows® 76, Windows Vista®6, Windows® XP\nSP26, Windows® 20006, or Mac OS® X (v10.4)5 + Internet Explorer® v6 or Mozilla® Firefox® v3.0\n\n\nAnd 5 translates to:\n\nThe software included with this product is not Mac-compatible.\n\nSharePort drivers\nThere are SharePort drivers for OS X though:\n\n*\n\n*This forum page links to a driver download for OS X up to 10.6.\n\n*This manual (zipped PDF)  is linked as Additional downloads and also mentions support for OS X up to 10.6.\n\nThis is for the \"USB via network\" feature, so this might work. The advantage is that the file system on the drive should be transparent to the router just forwarding the USB connection. That's why they can say they support any USB device: They don't actually care what kind of device is connected.\nRegular sharing\nIt doesn't look like this device has any regular sharing functionality. Wouldn't surprise me, given the networked USB feature.\n\nA: I suggest being very conservative when it comes to your backup strategy. The more pieces you have, the greater the chance that one of them may not work 100% all the time, especially when dealing with third-party hardware. If something does fail and you're not aware of it, you may find yourself in a situation where you only find out your backup is bad/out of date/nonexistent when your primary drive fails.\nIf you're looking to do over-the-air backups, I suggest doing them to a Time Capsule or setting up AFP sharing on another Mac and backing it up that way. Both those solutions are supported ways for Time Machine to work, and, yes, if you're so inclined you can hook your Drobo to the Mac and use that.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut in Mail.app for moving the active email to the top of the inbox? I'm trying out Mail.app on Lion (10.7.3) for the first time and, nice as it is, I'm frustrated that I have to use the mouse to jump to the top of my inbox after using the search function.\nTo give you an idea of what I'm talking about, here's a quick demo:\n\n\n*\n\n*option-command-f to search your inbox for something a couple weeks old\n\n*tab out of the search field and navigate mail in the mailbox with the arrow keys\n\n*option-command-f to go back to the search field and delete your search terms\n\n*now tab back into the mailbox view- the old email is selected, and you're miles away from the top of your inbox\n\n\nHitting \"home\" shifts the view to the top of the inbox, but the \"cursor\" is still on the last active email (i.e. the one that was highlighted in blue), and as soon use you hit the up or down keys, the view will snap/jump back down to show you where the active email is, relative to the top. you're miles away from the top of your inbox again!\ncommand + up arrow, option + up arrow, fn + left arrow, or any combination of arrows, home, and page up keys- none of them will make the topmost email in the mailbox active!

I suggest providing Mail feedback to Apple if you'd like to see it work properly.\nFor a workaround, try the following AppleScript:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set the selected messages of message viewer 1 to {} -- deselect messages\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 115 -- scroll to top\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nYou can make this into a Service and assign a keyboard shortcut to it from the Keyboard section of System Preferences.\n", "Q: Adobe Bridge Opening on Login For some reason Adobe Bridge is opening on login, even though my Login Items shows that it is unchecked.\nWithout uninstalling Adobe Bridge, how can I stop it opening on login?\n\n\nA: The checkbox is to hide the application:\n\nRemove it from the list by clicking the \"-\" button while it is selected.\n", "Q: Word for Mac - Equations I am finally making the switch from Windows to Mac and one big impediment/irritant is in the switch from Word for Windows to Word for Mac.  I do a lot of mathematical work and have a large number of Word documents with equations in them from the Word 2010/2011 equation feature.  In the Windows version, this is just a Pi symbol that I click to start typing an equation, and I can insert functions, summations, fractions, exponents, things like that really easily.  I have Word 2008 on my Mac right now and none of those documents will even open.  I could try updating to the newest version of Office, but I'm worried that I'll do that, they still won't work, and I'll be out a lot of money.  \nI'd like to not only open all these documents but also to continue writing mathematical documents the same way I'm used to on Windows.  What can I do?\n\nA: In a blank document, go to Insert → Object → Microsoft Equation Editor to insert new equations. (If you were using Word for Mac 2011, it would be Insert → Equation.) Do you see that menu item or not? If not, note that Equation Editor isn’t part of the default install, and you might not have it. You’ll need to pop your install disc back in and do a custom install of it. Check the Value Pack Installer.\n(Source).\n\nA: Office 2011 for Mac is very much like Office 2010 on Windows. You'll see the same equation button in the Ribbon, and more buttons while you're editing an equation. I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\n\nPlus, you can always download a trial version of Office 2011 to make sure your files will be compatible!\n\nA: You may be interested in checking out MathType Mac 6.7. Their news release notes:\n\nSince Microsoft has restored VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to\n  Office 2011, we were able to restore all the MathType commands in Word\n  that had to be dropped for Office 2008, including an insert equation\n  button, equation numbering, and many others.\nAlthough many of our customers use MathType with Office, we also know\n  that you are interested in adding equations to emails, blog posts,\n  elearning systems, and many other applications and websites.\n  Continuing our “Equations Everywhere and Anywhere” philosophy,\n  MathType 6.7 expands support to more than 500 applications and\n  websites, including iWork '09 (Pages, Numbers, Keynote), OpenOffice,\n  Google Docs, InDesign, Maple, Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Blackboard,\n  Moodle, Smart Board, Gmail, Wikipedia, to name just a few.\nSome of you will be happy to know we’ve rewritten MathType’s installer\n  from the ground up. It no longer requires Rosetta and the installation\n  process is much, much faster.\n\nThe full feature list is listed on this page.\nOffice 2011 now also has Equation Editor, per this Microsoft Office blog post:\n\nFor users who add or edit equations in their Word docs, the new\n  equation editor in Word for Mac 2011 is a welcome new feature that\n  makes equation editing cross-platform with Word for Windows.\n\nYou now have several options to select from for working on equations within Word.\n\nA: For you, using Microsoft Office 2011 is the best way to go, IMO.\n\nIn case you are not familiar which TeX tools in OSX, you may continue reading :)\nI prefer to use TeXShop or LyX for mathematical documentation.

The only application I have on my Mac that works with PhotoStream is iPhoto. I'm wondering if my Mac grabs the images from PhotoStream constantly or if it only downloads them when I launch an application that uses PhotoStream (such as iPhoto).\n\nA: Yes! A process called PhotoStreamAgent runs at login, and idles in the background, downloading new photos when they're uploaded to your Photo Stream.\n\nThere exist both /Applications/Aperture.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/PhotoStreamAgent.app and /Applications/iPhoto.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/PhotoStreamAgent.app, indicating that this background-downloading behavior works no matter which application you use to manage your photo library.\n(And as Asmus points out, photos are stored in ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets)\n\nA: The photos are \"constantly\" downloaded to your Mac, and stored in subfolders within ~/Library/Application\\ Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub.\n", "Q: How can I start Bluetooth tethering using the command line?

Using the bluetooth menu, I can choose the Connect to Network option in the submenu for my device, but is it possible to automate this?\nUltimately I want to assign this to a shortcut in (the very awesome) Alfred.app, but anything using the command line or AppleScript will work. \nIs this possible? Thanks!!\n\nA: It doesn't look like there is a direct AppleScript dictionary for working with Bluetooth this way. \nYou could use GUI scripting though, which basically uses the accessibility feature of the Mac OS to select menu items, etc. \nA great writeup on how to start with GUI AppleScript is available on MacOSAutomation.com. \nGUI automation can be difficult if you have a constantly changing list of things, but if you commonly have a list of bluetooth items connected that stays the same you should be ok.\nYou could then call this AppleScript through Alfred. \n\nA: http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=38559\nIn the above link there's a very nice script I've just updated a bit.

Now that iOS has Twitter integration, and many apps use these credentials rather than asking you for the Username and Password, I was wondering if there was any way to tell each app which account to use.\nFor example, in Settings > Twitter, you can sign on to multiple accounts. Now let's say I use 2 apps that both have Twitter integration. Is there any way App A could use one account on Twitter and App B could use my other account?\nFurthermore, I notice that at the bottom of the Twitter settings page, it shows a list of apps that have access to Twitter. Is there any way to allow each application access to only a specific Twitter account?\nI noticed that the Twitter app itself has a \n\nA: Developers access your Twitter accounts through the Accounts framework.\nWhen an app requests access to your accounts, it uses the requestAccessToAccountsWithType:withCompletionHandler: method. (The only supported account type is currently ACAccountTypeIdentifierTwitter.) This grants access to all accounts of that type.\nTherefore, unfortunately, apps can't request access to only a single account — you have to give access to all of your Twitter accounts.\n", "Q: Are there any differences, feature-wise, between Safari for Mac and Safari for Windows? I know that Chrome for Windows and Chrome for Mac are extremely similar. So similar that I only notice one difference for the Mac version: the green + button doesn't maximize. However, that can be remedied: http://maximizechrome.com. According to Google - I'm not sure where - there's only one difference: dragging highlighted text. I didn't notice this, but I don't usually drag highlighted text.\nI don't use Safari very often, but one thing I do appreciate is when an app behaves the same no matter your OS. I might even switch to Safari if it does this. Thus, the question: Are there any differences, feature-wise, between Safari for Mac and Safari for Windows?\nI mean real differences, not just things like the dropdown box styling provided by the OS.\n\nA: Anything involving the multi-touch track pad is going to be different, since that is an OS X feature. Including the double finger gesture to scroll back or forward.\n\nIn fact that feature works so seamlessly in Safari for Mac that that's one of the reasons I might switch to Safari from Chrome. It integrates beautifully with all the latest features of OS X.\n\nA: There is a significant issue in viewing PDFs on web sites.\nAdobe Reader for Mac has a browser plug-in for viewing PDF files. It's never been compatible with FireFox for Mac, or Safari 5.1 and higher for Mac.\nWith FireFox, there's no reliable way to view a PDF file that's on a link from a Web site within FireFox itself. The best you can do is download it and open it using a PDF viewer on your Mac.\nWith Safari, you can view a PDF file in the browser window with Mac OS X's built-in PDF display capability. It works well enough, but it isn't the Adobe Reader Browser Plug-in, and that can create some problems with services that require the Adobe plug-in.\n\nA: Pretty much all of the menu options and features in Safari for Windows are exactly the same as Safari for Mac, but you won't get the same integration with the operating system that you see on OS X — standard-looking Downloads popover, Dictionary integration, great drag & drop and text editing, a nice PDF plugin, gesture support, etc.\nI can see the benefits of using the same browser on two operating systems (familiarity, syncing of user data, etc.). But I have to mention that most of my Windows-using friends really dislike Apple's Windows software — it doesn't quite \"fit in\" with the rest of Windows, and they have a Software Update for Windows that's infamous for sticking around when you try to delete it, offering to install new software that you don't want.\nBasically, I think that if you want a better Windows experience, you probably shouldn't use Safari. Chrome seems to be a favorite of many, and it uses the same rendering engine as Safari, so the web will work just as well.\n", "Q: Can I use iPad 1 or iPad 2 accessories (such as cases / covers) on the new iPad (3)? Does the new iPad have the same form factor / dimensions as the first two iPads?  Can I re-use accessories from the first two iPads?\n\nA: It depends. The iPad (3rd Generation) is slightly thicker than the iPad 2, but there are reports that many cases designed for the 2 will work on the new model. Both of these iPads can use the smart cover technology too. Check with the case manufacturer or online forums to be check the compatibility of specific models.\nUpdate: It seems not all Apple Smart Covers are created equal. Early smart covers may not work with iPad (3gen) because Apple changed the polarity of the sleep sensor magnets at some point during the production run. \nThe original iPad was the thickest of the lot and had no smart cover capability. Most cases (if not all) were not interchangeable between the newer models.\nAccessories should work unless they're truly dimension critical or require a technology not present in a previous model.\nMy inCase Origami case and the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard it protects continues to work with all iPad models, as do my car chargers, video adaptors and the Apple Camera Connection Kit. The OtterBox Defender case on my original iPad won't doesn't work on newer models.\n\nA: The Smart Cover will still work.\nAccording to the Smart Cover page on the Apple store:\n\nThe iPad Smart Cover is compatible with iPad 2 or later.\n\nAlso at the bottom of the page:\n\nSo, the answer, based what Apple has said, is yes, the original Smart Cover will fit both the iPad 2 and the iPad 3.\nThere are also several questions linked in the product page that say that the cover will fit.\n\nA: The iPad 2 and new (3) have cameras front and back and the cases for iPad 1 cover the cameras.

If I enable the new FileVault feature in Mac OS X Lion, will it also encrypt my existing Windows bootcamp partitions? (And/or any new bootcamp partition I create?)\nUpdate: If not, where can I get information about using FileVault and BootCamp? I'm looking for info on how to enable FileVault 2 with an existing BootCamp installation, and also for creating a BootCamp installation after FileVault 2 is already installed.\n\nA: No, Windows does not support FileVault (so it would not boot if it was encrypted thus!) The Windows option would be BitLocker.\n(perhaps it is more correct to say FileVault does not support anything but Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partitions)\nIf you need a great, free, cross-platform, open-source, strong encryption tool check out VeraCrypt.\nCan you use FileVault on your Mac OS X partition and BitLocker on your Boot Camp Windows partition at the same time?\nTheoretically it should be fine but I don't think I would do it for two reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*There are quite a few mentions (if you google) of the Boot Camp partition failing to boot if FileVault isn't enabled in a very specific way. That could be from early FileVault and everything might be fine now but it makes me nervous enough. If you do it clone your drive first.\n\n*It's really useful to be able to share information between operating systems. If you have both encrypted using a method the other can't handle you lose that ability. However, if you use VeraCrypt, you can host a partition file on either OS and access it from both, and mount it as required - as well as back it up, archive it etc. If you're worried about encryption strength, VeraCrypt is also the better option as you can configure it for truly paranoid security. I also like the thought that crypto experts are able to look at the source and would have blown the whistle on it by now if it claimed to be something which it was not.\n\nA: I documented how to enable Bitlocker on Bootcamp (and I have FV2 enabled too) here: Enabling BitLocker without TPM on MacBook Pro with Bootcamp\n", "Q: Iphone 4 drain wifi 1 percent per minute I have an iPhone and it's jailbroken, running iOS 5.1.

Is there anything that could cause the battery's \"cycles count\" in the Power section of System Information app to report number of charge cycles greater than the actual number?\nI ask because the number of charge cycles displayed for my MacBook Air is greater than the number of days I have owned the computer, and I certainly have not used it every day, nor charged and then used the battery more than once a day. What could cause the number to be so high?\n\nA: A faulty sensor could do it. Apple says:\n\"A charge cycle means using all of the battery’s power, but that doesn’t necessarily mean a single charge. For instance, you could use your notebook for an hour or more one day, using half its power, and then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it would count as one charge cycle, not two, so it may take several days to complete a cycle.\"\nLooks like a good case for a visit to the Genius Bar, and perhaps having your battery replaced. I agree it does not seem at all plausible that your cycle count is higher than the days you have owned it.\n", "Q: How can I reset my iPhone 4 to an old version of iOS? I have a jailbroken iPhone 4 with iOS 5.0.1 and baseband 4.11.08.\nI'm having some battery life issues (1% is consumed per minute), so I want to reset (or reformat) my phone to 5.0.1. I dont want to use 5.1 since it will upgrade to a new firmware. How can I do that?\nI would like it to remain jailbroken.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I tried my best to include all information I could possibly give, but I could have mistakenly left something out. Please be careful, and I won't be responsible for anything that goes awry with your device. These steps worked for me, but sh** happens.\nApple isn't signing the iOS 5.0.1 .ipsw's anymore, so you're going to have to make sure you have your SHSH blobs for 5.0.1 by going into Cydia and seeing if 5.0.1 is listed up at the top:\n\nIf you see it there, you're good to go to the next step. The way Apple signs .ipsw's has changed with iOS 5, so if you've previously done a downgrade/unsigned restore, you'll notice many steps that aren't the same as the ones you're used to. You might run into a problem if your SHSH blobs weren't saved properly. It's not your fault, and if you do encounter any problems, stop following this tutorial. You won't be able to fix it. Nobody can yet; that's the sad truth. I do, however, suggest that you save your SHSH blobs using iFaith. That way, if anything goes terribly wrong, you'll still be able to restore to any version of iOS that you have the SHSH blob for.\nYou'll also need iFaith for another step, so make sure you have it. Once you have everything saved and the programs downloaded, you need to download the iOS 5.0.1 .ipsw file here. You're going to want to make sure you get the correct version for your device. Once that's finished downloading, plug your device into your computer, open iFaith, and dump your SHSH blobs (if you haven't already done so). Once they're saved, you'll be taken back to the main menu in iFaith. Create a signed .ipsw with your SHSH blobs by selecting the respective option and following the on-screen instructions. Once it's created, open up iTunes, navigate to your device from the menu on the left, and you'll see the Upgrade and Restore buttons. You need to hold down the Option key (Shift on Windows) and click Restore.\n\nYou'll then need to select the .ipsw file you created earlier in the window that comes up. Once selected, it'll start restoring your device back to your selected version. Now you'll just need to wait for it to finish. It's easy to mess up, so please be careful.\nYou should now have a brand new (non-JailBroken) install of iOS 5.0.1. If you need it JailBroken again, just do it the same way you did before (with redsn0w).\n", "Q: How do I completely disable automatic keyboard backlighting on Macbook Pro with OSX Lion? I have the system pref \"Automatically illuminate the keyboard in low light\" disabled. However, when I wake the computer from sleep and the login prompt appears, the keyboard backlight turns on. Despite the fact that I didn't ask for this, it's actually somewhat useful, so I don't object to that. But, once I log in, the keyboard backlight stays on. AND, to make matters worse, the machine seems to \"think\" that the backlight is off, because pushing the backlight dimming button (the one shared with F5) doesn't dim the keyboard backlight. Instead, I have to first increase the backlight, then decrease it, in order to disable it.\nSo, I'm looking for a way either to: 1. ensure that the auto-enabled keyboard backlight self-disables upon login, or 2. completely, 100%, totally disable any auto-enabling of the keyboard backlight (an acceptable alternative to 1, since I don't really need it auto-enabling at login).\nNote: an unacceptable solution is one that completely disables the keyboard backlight. I need to be able to invoke it manually when desired.\n\nA: Lab Tick is a shareware menu item that gives you complete control over the keyboard backlight. You can set the level of illumination by hand, and electively disable automatic adjustments made by the OS.\n\n\nA: You can try reset SMC to fix the bug. Shut down the computer,then press option+control+shift+Power for several seconds and then boot it. \n\nA: I had this exact problem you described on my MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra. What I did to solve it was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keyboard preferences: Apple Logo > System Preferences > Keyboard \n\n*Check and uncheck the top 3 options (\"Adjust keyboard bright in low light\", \"Turn keyboard backlight off after X of inactivity\", and \"Show keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar\". I just messed around with them to see what they do. \n\n*Close it out.\n\n*Re-open Keyboard preferences: Apple Logo > System Preferences > Keyboard\n\n*Make sure \"Adjust keyboard brightness in low light\" is unchecked. \n\n*Close it out.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nI'm not sure if all these steps are necessary since I cannot replicate the initial problem anymore, but I found the reboot to be necessary. Good luck.\n", "Q: How can I send a mail message later? Back in the day, I remember having an e-mail program (perhaps it was Eudora?) that could schedule the sending of mail, so when composing a message, you could set some preference for when it would be sent. The message would be composed and queued up, but would not send until the computer was connected to the internet at or after the schedule time.\nIs there a way to duplicate this feature in Apple Mail? Specifically, I want to compose a message, but rather than clicking \"Send\", I click \"Delayed send\" (either from the Services menu, the AppleScript menu, or, ideally, from an icon magically added to the Mail toolbar, but I don't expect that will be easy to pull ofF). When I do this, I'd get a dialog box asking me when I want to send the message. I enter the information, and the message is queued up and will be sent at the soonest time after the scheduled send time/date when the computer is on and connected.\n\nA: There is a plugin for Mail app which name is SendLater:\n\n\nA: No promises, because some of the scripts break under OS X 10.7 Lion, but you might find your answer by using Andreas Amann's Mail Scripts which includes \n\nSchedule Delivery (Mail)\nAllows you to send individual messages at predefined times (this\n  script uses iCal for scheduling message delivery).\n\nAndreas makes the source code of his compiled scripts available.

On my Mac, I can log in to the developer center to watch the videos from the website, and that I can log in on iTunes on my Mac to browse and download them. However, is there a way to browse and watch WWDC session videos directly from my iPad or AppleTV?\nI've tried logging in to the Apple developer center on my iPad's browser, then viewing the videos \"in iTunes\"--this brings up the iTunes app, with a section called \"Developer on iTunes\", but also a pop-up dialog telling me \"Access Denied\". On the AppleTV, there isn't even a browser, and searching iTunes U in both places has yielded nothing.\n\nA: You can find them in iTunes U, and if you log in at \nApple Developer Site\nwith a valid developer ID, you will get a list of videos - and there is a button to \"View all in iTunes\".\nWhen I did this a minute ago on the iPad I got a \"One moment please\" followed by a redirect to iTunes, and all the videos appeared in categories, all marked \"Free\".\nIf it isn't working for you then there must be a problem with your account. If you can access it through the Mac you're probably going to need to talk to Apple about it. \nYou've probably thought to try \"Clear Cookies and Data\" from Preferences->Safari?\n\nA: What Adam Eberbach said all applies, but you have to also make sure you are signed in with the same Apple ID on your iOS device.\n\nA: There is an official  WWDC app on the iOS App Store.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Colorware with Apple Products Could someone who has, or knows someone who has, used Colorware for an Apple product comment on their experiece?  I'm thinking about getting an third-generation iPad colored through Colorware, as they seem to be a solid coloring solution.  Are the devices returned in factory condition?  Does Apple accept colored devices if, say, a pixel died in the first month or so?  Does the coloring look professional?\n\nA: Colorware clearly states that their customization voids Apple's warranty:\n\nColorWare Inc. replaces all existing Apple Inc. warranty policies and procedures with a ColorWare Inc. warranty, the documentation for which is included with all products purchased from ColorWare Inc.\n\nMore detailed information is available at ColorWare's warranty page, where they specify that they cover \"workmanship defects and non-accidental hardware failures\". While this sounds similar to Apple's warranty, it would be difficult to expect similar quality of service, especially outside of the United States.\n\nA: I know the above question was posted some time ago,  but perhaps others have thought about ordering a customized Apple product from Colorware. \nI purchased my Macbook Pro in 2010 in the Apple Retail Store located in Greensboro, NC. \n2 weeks later,  I shipped my Macbook Pro to ColorwarePC.   My color choice was Ferrari Red,  with trackpad and hinge in Smoke White. \nSome 2 weeks later,  I had my one of a kind Macbook back in hand.\nFirst..... I have visited them for training and technical questions regarding software and technical questions about upgrading RAM,  etc.  (Since this was my first Mac).   NEVER ONCE did anyone at Apple EVER even try to avoid helping me.  In fact, they all gathered around wanting to check it out. That was in 2010.  Here it is 2016, and they STILL flock to help me,  and everyone wants to know where they can get one.   Of course,  the cost keeps most only observers. \nI still have the same Macbook... It still looms lime it did the day it came back from Colorware PC.   Only one light surface buff mark.   I can't say enough about the incredible glossy finish.   \nI have replaced the 350GB HDD with a 1TB SS Drive.... and I have replaced the standard 4GB RAM with 16GB RAM.   Yes... You read that correctly.   Nothing special needed... and yes,  FULLY compatible,  with no glitch and no rejection.   Lightning speed. \nBTW... It will void your Apple warranty,  but I've never met the very first Macbook user who ever had to utilize the warranty anyway.

Nobody is that paranoid about their emails being exposed but it seems like best practise not to, there's always that person who thinks everyone wants to be on their \"funny\" picture mailing list, some addresses will be corporate and that kind of thing can cause problems for the recipient.\nIt's fine if there's a free or paid app you can suggest, ease of use is the number one requirement.\n\nA: May I suggest our unique \"MailShot Pro\" app, which is the ONLY app on the store that lets you create contact groups in your address book that you can use from any app to send email, just as you would use a single contact.\nWe have tens of thousands of users using it for exactly the sort of thing you describe\n\n\n*\n\n*You can protect privacy by adding the contact group to the Bcc line.\n\n*You can edit the group permanently in the MailShot app, or temporarily just before you send an email (simply by saving and retrieving the email from Drafts)\n\n*And you can share groups between multiple devices using iCloud contact sharing.\n\n\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mailshot-pro-group-email-done/id445996226?ls=1&mt=8. (A free trial version is also available.)\nPeter\nSoluble Apps\nFull Disclosure:I am the developer of MailShot and will benefit from its sale, but so might you :)\n\nA: I know it's not strictly an iOS app, but my suggestion would be to use Google Groups for her mailing lists. I've set up a few for immediate and extended family and they work very well. Sending email to everyone in the group is as simple as sending it to the @googlegroups.com email address you pick when setting up the group, and because it's been sent to the @googlegroups.com email address the email addresses of the recipients are naturally kept private.\nAdministration is web-based (can easily be done on Mobile Safari) if she wants to add or remove people, but the advantage of using Google Groups is that she can configure it so that people can add or remove themselves to the group, so she doesn't have to bother with doing that.\n\nA: The easiest solution may be to purchase an app like Group Email! I don't have any experience with the app, but it well rated in the App Store.\nOne trick I use to keep group members email addresses private: I put my own email address in the To: field and put the group address(es) in BCC:\nUnfortunately, iOS Mail doesn't provide a way to make use of them (yet?) but you can create and manage Contact groups on your iPad using Bento, the simple database solution from Filemaker.\n(Why do I suspect that if Apple updates Mail.app to work with groups, they'll also provide a way to edit groups, making this explanation moot?)\nBento reads the Contacts core data automatically and creates an Address Book library. Any groups already defined (in Address Book on the Mac) will be added as collections and contacts that are part of a group will be added to that collection. (A record can be part of multiple collections).\nYou can add new members to the group by adding them to the collection. You can create new groups by adding a new collection. Bento is sharing the core data with Contacts so these collections are in turn displayed in the iOS Contacts.app as groups, but you may have to manually quit and reopen Contacts to see them.\n\n\nA: Easiest way: Use Dolphin browser and log in to www.icloud.com\nThere you can access your contacts and create a group there and move people into the group. The iCloud will sync this to iPad contacts. \n", "Q: Delete a rented movie that is only partially downloaded I rented a movie and actually was able to watch it, but in iTunes it still shows up as a download in progress with an error and when I tap the icon it just says I don't have enough memory to continue the download (for the movie that I already watched and the rental time expired for). It is taking up a bunch of space and I want it gone!  Please help. I do not have a computer I can get onto at this time and don't want to lose my 100+songs currently stored on my iPhone.  \n\nA: Somewhat bizarrely it is not possible to delete downloads in the iPhone iTunes.\nThe only way to delete the download, is to contact Apple (the iTunes section) and they will delete it for you. (you can contact support through the desktop iTunes app, or here)\n\nA: Yeah agree with Jonathan, explain that you've already seen it, that it is causing issues and you want it removed from your downloads queue. They should have no problem doing so for you.\n", "Q: iPad/iPhone on iOS 5 - images don't always load in Safari, just on my network This question is baffling to say the least, as I'm just not sure how to diagnose where the problem is happening.\nHere's the problem: when I am connected to my network in the office (but not on other networks), the iPads or iPhones (all running latest iOS) sometimes don't show all of the images in Safari, and you have to reload the page (sometimes several times) to get all of the images to load. This was never an issue with prior iOS builds (prior to version 5).\nThis never happens on any other network - for example at the Apple Store, or cafe wifi networks.\nOur office setup is as follows:\nD-Link 4 Port Modem Router DSL-526B connected to ADSL2+ service\nconnected to:\nD-Link NetDefend SOHO UTM Firewall DFL-160\nconnected to:\nD-Link 16-Port WebSmart Gigabit Switch DGS-1210-16\nNothing has changed with the aforementioned setup between going from iOS 4 to 5. And we're seeing it with both iPad 2s and 3rd-generation iPads and with iPhone 4/4S\nWhat could be happening for this to be a problem with our network? We don't have any issues with our Macs.\n\nA: Tough one.  Definitely need to see more troubleshooting.  Some places to start:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find an image that the iPads are having difficulty loading, then open just that image in a separate page in Safari.  Any problem loading and reloading the image on a page by itself?\n\n*How many WiFi devices are being served by one base station?  At some point it gets overloaded with sheer volume of requests, even if the data transfer is small.  \n\n*Is the WiFi base station doing NAT, possibly leading to a double-NAT setup that will clog the local network with failed connections?  You would still be able to browse the web, but overall network performance would suffer.\n\nA: I have experienced similar issues and performed a couple of steps that seemed to help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable ipv6 in the routers. Of course, this assumes you are not using ipv6. I believe this step gave me the most improvement.\n\n*Restrict your wifi to the minimum number of standards needed. For example, if all the devices are N-capable, limit your wifi network to that standard.  \n\n", "Q: How does \"Find my Mac\" work, since there's no GPS in a Mac? I have used \"Find my Mac\" to find our Macbook Pro. It was pretty accurate and was able to place the computer within 10 feet of its actual location. I started thinking about how it actually works, since the MBP doesn't have a GPS. How does \"Find my Mac\" work?\n\nA: Even without a GPS chip, your location can be determined using your MAC address, SSIDs of WiFi networks in range (both private and public networks), their signal strength, etc. In Apple’s case, this data is submitted to the Skyhook Wireless service, which then returns a set of GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude).\nIf you’re interested in how geolocation works in other devices and applications, and what data is being sent back and forth exactly, see this answer on Stack Overflow which explains how Firefox does this using Google’s geolocation service (which is what most other apps use).\n\nA: It checks what Wifi networks are in range and then looks up their locations in a big database of known Wifi access points -- I think Apple use the Skyhook database.\n\nA: Wi-Fi Positioning system (WPS)\nThe Mac can use Wi-Fi network identification for localization. This is called a Wi-Fi Positioning System (WPS). The access points name and signal strength is determined and looked up in a database to identify the location. The more access points are found, the more precise the localization.\nUnlike GPS (Global Positioning System) or cell-tower triangulation (together called Assisted-GPS), the Wi-Fi based localization works well inside buildings.\nThere are different databases which collect wireless access points:\n\n*\n\n*commercial: Google, Navizon and Skyhook Wireless\n\n*open: OpenWLANMap (GNU Free Documentation Licence)\n\n\nA: SIMPLE ANSWER:\nmac laptops don't have a GPS chip.

I'm considering buying DayOne, a journaling app for iOS and Mac that syncs through iCloud's Documents and Data feature. I already own the iWork app suite on iOS and Mac, and I do not want to use iCloud syncing for the iWork apps. Is there a way I can turn on the Documents and Data syncing on iCloud for use with DayOne without having the iWork apps sync through iCloud?\nedit: Thanks for the iOS portion of the answer, Jonathan. I still would like an explicit answer about the iWork apps on my Mac, though. Has iWork '09 been updated for iCloud? If so, does each app have a setting to turn on/off iCloud storage? I read somewhere that there's a ~/Library/Mobile Documents folder where your files are stored if you are using iCloud, and I want to be sure that I do what is necessary to prevent the iWork apps from doing this once I enable Documents & Settings on my Mac. Please reference the source of your information. I'd rather not have to learn by trial & error. Has anyone already tried this?\nedit 2: Sorry I didn't specify earlier, I thought it was an obvious assumption, but I'm using iOS version 5.1 on my iPhone and OS X Lion on my Mac (the latest released versions of both operating systems).\n\nA: You can disable iCloud on iWork by going to the Settings app, and scroll down to the install apps settings, you will find each iWork app has it's own section, Pages, Numbers and Keynote.\nIn each iWork app's settings there is an option \"Use iCloud\". Turn this to off, and keep the Documents and Data in the iCloud menu on.\nFor Mac, the iWork apps do not support iCloud Document Sync. (If you enable sync on iOS, the files created on iOS will download into your library, you can't open them however, and you are unable to upload to iCloud in iWork)\nIn Mountain Lion they will, but it appears that iCloud Doc sync integration will be at the OS Level, rather than iWork app level. Instead being more like DropBox* where you have an area (I say area, because it's not a folder, but it's quite similar to one) for iCloud.\n*Although this area only seems to appear in Open/Save Dialogs, and will only show files that are registered to the App.\n\nA: The primary element of syncing is having Data to sync.\nIf you simply do not chose to store documents in iCloud and instead choose to store them locally on your hard drive in the way you have always previously done, then those files cannot be synchronised by iCloud, even if it remains turned \"on\" (Where \"on\" really means \"available to use if you want to\" rather than \"It's on, you're now using it\")\nDayOne has a similar option, you can choose to use iCloud, or you can choose the old fashioned file/folder method.  The fact that this folder can be in Dropbox and then result in subsequent synchronising is not relevant to the app.\nSo, in summary, using iCloud requires you to knowingly put your files into the cloud.  Your existing files and indeed file locations will remain unaffected if you continue to use them.\nAs pointed out in another answer and subsequent edit to the question, the iWork suite '09 for Mac has yet to be updated to use iCloud.  Chances are it will not be, and the OS will simply handle this for all supported applications.  iCloud enabled documents in Mountain Lion simply share the same save dialogue that any normal document has, there is simply a toggle at the top of the dialogue that you can flip to say local or icloud.  As such, you have the choice to save to either/or on a per document basis, and there will be no system wide setting to choose one or the other on the Mac.  This mechanism will likely be brought into Lion when ML is released.\n\nRegardless of ANY of the above, DayOne app syncing over iCloud has got absolutely no relationship with any other Application, whether is used iCloud or not, and can happily be configured to use iCloud completely independently of your choices for other apps.\n", "Q: Xcode 4 and Snow Leopard This is the thing :\n\n\n*\n\n*I have Xcode 4.3 on my MacBook Pro (running Lion)\n\n*I am stuck with 4.0.2 on my iMac (running Snow Leopard)\n\n\nGiven that I would really like to retain a SnowLeopard-running machine (for development purposes), is there any way I could get anything 4.1 or above, to run on my iMac? \n\nA: If you have registered for the paid iOS developer program, you should be able to see Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard available in the iOS Dev Center.\nHere's what I see from a paid account: \n\nHere's what I see from a non-paid account (there's no Xcode 4.x for Snow Leopard):\n\nThis also explains why Xcode is a paid download in the Snow Leopard App Store, but is free in the Lion App Store.\n\nA: If you don’t really need Xcode, but all you need are the Xcode command line tools, here’s how to install them on Snow Leopard.\nSimply download the “Command Line Tools” package from Apple Developer (free account required; you can use your Apple ID). As of this writing, the package is named “Command Line Tools for Xcode - Late March 2012”. It’s a 171.70 MB disk image, which pales in contrast to the 4+ GB full Xcode download.\nNote that, if you’ve already installed Xcode, you’ll want to uninstall it before installing the Command Line Tools.\nOnce you’ve downloaded the package, launch Terminal.app and type:\ncd\nmkdir osx-gcc\ncd /Volumes/Command\\ Line\\ Tools\ncp -r * ~/osx-gcc\n\ncd ~/osx-gcc\nmkdir pkg\nmv Command\\ Line\\ Tools.mpkg pkg/install.mpkg\ncd pkg\nxar -xvf install.mpkg\n\nNote: It’s important that you use cp -r, rather than simply cp; the former will copy all hidden installation files to the ~/osx-gcc directory. The Command Line Tools.mpkg file is merely a 512 KB descriptor that contains the installation instructions; the actual packages are located in the hidden, aptly-named Packages directory.\nNext, open the Distribution file with your favorite text editor. I prefer TextMate (mate Distribution), but you can use vi, emacs, BBEdit, TextWrangler, or even TextEdit (open -a TextEdit Distribution). On the tenth line, you should see the following:\nvar majorOSVersion = '10.7';\n\nThis specifies the minimum operating system requirement — OS X 10.7 Lion, in this case. Change '10.7' to '10.6', save the file, and close your text editor. You’ve now modified the package so that it will install successfully on Snow Leopard; the final step is to recreate the package file so that it can be read by the installer app:\nrm install.mpkg\nxar -c . -vf ../install.mpkg\ncd ..\nopen install.mpkg\n\n\nA: After logging into the mac dev center, the \"OS X Lion\" homepage has a link near the bottom \"Additional Downloads\" with the description \"Find additional pre-release software, previous versions of Mac OS X, and hardware driver downloads in the Apple Developer Downloads site.\"\nClicking the View All Downloads link takes me to a list of >150 downloads, sorted by date, and a category search.\nIn the Developer Tools category, click the \"next page\" link until you get to Xcode  for Snow Leopard.\nNote I found it in the Mac Dev Center, I didn't check the iOS Dev Center, though I suspect the download might be there as well.\n", "Q: How to remap delete and shift+delete keys to delete and permanently delete a file in Mac OS X Lion? I would like to delete and permanently delete a file in finder using del and shift+delete (windows style).\nIs there any way to remap this in OS X lion?\n\nA: If you want to delete files immediately, you can copy the files, open Terminal or iTerm, type rm -r ‌ and press ⌘V.\nIf you want to delete the files securely so that they cannot be recovered with an application like DiskWarrior or DataRescue, you can use srm -srf. srm uses the 35-pass Gutmann algorithm by default, but -s only overwrites files with a single pass of random data.\nYou could also create a service like this:\n\nosascript -e 'on run argv\n    set text item delimiters to linefeed\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        display dialog \"Delete the following files immediately?\" & linefeed & linefeed & text items of argv\n    end tell\nend run' \"$@\"\n[[ $? != 0 ]] && exit 0\nrm -rf \"$@\"\n\nI didn't use an Ask for Confirmation action, because it can't be used to display the paths specified as arguments, and the dialogs shown by it don't get keyboard focus.\nThe service cannot be used to delete a file if deleting it would require superuser privileges.\nYou can give the service a keyboard shortcut from System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services. The shortcut recorders don't allow entering ⇧⌦ as a keyboard shortcut, but you can first give the service some temporary shortcut, then close the System Preferences window, then run something like f=~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist; plutil -convert xml1 $f; open -e $f, and then change the key equivalent to $&#x007F;:\n<key>(null) - Delete Immediately - runWorkflowAsService</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>key_equivalent</key>\n    <string>$&#xU007F;</string>\n</dict>\n\n$&#x007F; is ⇧⌦ (where ⌦ is Mac forward delete / Windows delete). ⇧⌫ would be $&#x0008; (where ⌫ is Mac delete / Windows backspace). The format used for the shortcut strings is described in http://lri.me/keybindings.html.\n\nAs for making ⌦ (Mac forward delete / Windows delete) move files to the trash, you can modify Finder's property list:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict 'Move to Trash' '\\U007F'\nkillall Finder\n\nHowever that also makes pressing ⌦ move a file to the trash when you are renaming a file.\n\nA: If a two-step keyboard process is acceptable, you could always do:\n⌘ + ⌫ to move the file to the Trash\nthen\n⌘ + ⇧ + ⌫ to empty the Trash (with confirmation popup) or\n⌘ + ⇧ + ⌥ +⌫ to empty the Trash (without confirmation popup). \nObviously, that will also get rid of all the other files already in the trash.\nAlternatively, maybe something like Trash X would help. The description says:\n\nYou can use it to instantly delete or shred file and folders without\n  sending them to the trash. You can use it to empty or shred trash only\n  on selected disks. And of course, you can use it just like the\n  trashcan you've always had on your desktop.\n\n\nA: What you can do is send the file(s) to trash, and then click Finder->Secure Empty Trash.\nYou can also make a keyboard shortcut to make that process a little quicker, as described in this article.\nIt's not exactly what you want, but seems to be the closest you can get without looking into creating something with Automator or Keyboard Maestro.\n\nA: I have made a simple app in cocoa, which acts like the trash icon but with different behaviour ie. when a file or folder is dropped on its icon in dock, it deletes it permanently.\nI have also written a blog post about it-\nMac OS X : shift + delete\nHere is the link for the app- DeleteMe\nBasic idea is - use: rm -rf  , exactly the same what is suggested in the most voted answer, but implemented in a different way ;-)\nUpdate\nNow there is a better way to achieve 'permanent delete' functionality as specified by Matt Sephton in comment to this answer - Just use command + alt (option) + backspace. Thanks to him for the update.\n", "Q: What is the most effective way for a iPhoto user to have all photos synced and stored in the cloud for sharing? If I make the switch in handling my photos on my Mac, from Picasa to iPhoto, then I need to have a way to have all of my photos synced and stored on cloud servers, for photo sharing online. (note, all photos, not just the most recent 1000.)\nWhat is the most effective way for an iPhoto user to have their entire collection synced, stored, and shareable on a cloud server?\nThanks!!!\n\nA: iPhoto supports sharing of albums (including synchronising of comments, and name/face tagging) with Facebook.\nThis allows you to select a group of photos, and either put them into a Facebook album or post direct to a wall.  If you synchronise with a Facebook album, then iPhoto will perform a 2 way sync and pull the new pictures down locally for offline storage.\nIf you are worried about Privacy, you can always create an account just for this and really lock it down.\nIf even works on photos of girls with seemingly impossible sized teeth:\n\nOther than Facebook, sharing options are more limited.  Apple used to offer the MobileMe gallery service, but that is now not open to new customers and will be turned off in the coming months.\nThere is limited support for Flickr (believe it was better in '09 than in '11, which is weird), but to get anything close to the Facebook levels of deep integration you will have to get happy with some scripting and automation to (for example) run a script after each import to automatically copy the contents of the last import to Flickr etc.  This article talks of numerous ways to Flickr Sync, but non of them are as self-contained as Facebook sync, and require other tools and software to create a more complicated workflow, but it is possible and if you are a Flickr fan the extra effort may make it worthwhile\nAs a final option, you can still happily use your Picassa Web Albums, and just not use the local application, this question elsewhere in AskDifferent has an accepted answer on syncing iPhoto to Picassa.\n", "Q: Which text editor has better OSX support, TextMate, or Sublime Text 2 I've been using Sublime Text 2 for Windows and Linux because it's simply the best for those platforms.  However, when using OSX I have the option to use TextMake, which is where Sublime Text 2 seems to get its inspiration from.\nWhich editor works more seamlessly with OSX as far as speed, ease of use, OSX integration, and naturally intuitive keybindings?\n\nA: Go with what you're familiar with and don't worry about whether you're missing something or not.\nFamiliarity will trump any additional features you might likely discover in TextMate and the ability to sit in a familiar coding environment no matter what OS you're working is a really big productivity boost.\nOverall Sublime Text 2 is a move forward from TextMate at the time I'm writing this. It has better undo semantics. It can load in most TextMate bundles so you can extend it in the same ways TextMate can be extended. Though, truthfully, after switching from TextMate this year I haven't found a need to install any TextMate bundles because anything I had been using in TextMate was available as a better implemented, more feature rich bundle in native Sublime Text 2 format so far.\nThis being said, TextMate 2 is in alpha and can be downloaded, so an update is on the distant horizon. But my advice still stands: familiarity on multiple OSes is a fantastic thing for your development environment.\n\nA: If you're using multiple platforms, then I'd suggest going with Sublime Text 2. Sure, some things just don't act natively on the Mac, but as Ian said, nothing beats familiarity.\nPersonally I've been (and still am) a huge fan of ST2.  But recently I've switched over to a new application that is written in native Cocoa.  It's called Chocolat.  I've watched it get progressively more powerful through the betas, and It's definitely worth a look.\n\n\nA: There’s no objective answer to this question. Both TextMate and Sublime Text 2 integrate very well with OS X and use intuitive keyboard shortcuts.\nIf you’re used to working with Sublime Text 2 on other platforms, it would make sense to use it on OS X as well.\n\nA: I think TextMate 2 integrates better with OS X UX guidelines, it has a really beautiful interface, better finder integration and it has more Xcode-ish tools, like source control panels. Sublime Text does a pretty good job on integration, for a cross-platform software: it's interface's components don't feel alien in the system, it has support for overlay scrollbars, etc. In fact I think ST2/3 integrates better with OS X than with any other platform.\nHowever, regarding editing capabilities I wouldn't stick with anything else than Sublime. It has better keybinding settings, it's way more extensible.\nTextMate 2 is definitely an OS X app - along with other editors like Chocolat and Espresso - but if you're comfortable with Sublime, stick with it, it does a good job in order to not feel alien compared to the others.\n\nA: It's not a direct answer to the question, but consider BBEdit. It's beautifully integrated with Mac OSX. It's fully modern, and has been rock-solid across 10 versions for 15 years (I've been using it for that period, since 1.0). A trial version is freely available; in addition, there's a freeware stripped-down version, TextWrangler. \n\nA: Other apps are GitHub's ATOM and Panic Inc.'s Coda. These two are powerful code editors.\n", "Q: Use FaceTime with the same Apple ID? I and my wife own three Apple devices. MacBook Pro, iPad 2 (only Wi-Fi) and iPhone 4S. All of these are registered with the same Apple ID and Gmail account. With FaceTime I can call to IPhone, but I cannot call from my iPhone. Probably because iPad or MacBook do not have a unique id. How can this be fixed so I can use FaceTime in any direction? I do not want more than one Apple ID as it makes trouble in App Store and iCloud.\n\nA: You can add another email address for FaceTime in your iPad:\n\nThis will allow you to call your iPad uniquely with this id. \nSimilarly, you can add another email address to your MacBook Pro's Facetime:\n\n\nA: You have only on apple id, but do you have several emails ?\nIn this case, you can add on your Macbook or your iPad another email address on which you will be call on Facetime.\nFor example :\nYour apple id account : myname@gmail.com\nTo call to your iPhone, use your phone number.\nTo call to your iPad, use your apple id email.\nTo call to your Macbook add a new adress in FaceTime preferences :\n\nHope this helps !\n\nA: FaceTime, the App Store, and iCloud can all use separate Apple ID's for this reason. \nYour iPhone will also register its phone number with Apple's servers, so it can be reached there as well. \nIn your case, I would recommend making a new ID either for each device, or each person, and only use this ID for FaceTime for now. A limitation to this is that while you can add multiple ID's for FaceTime to recognize, these emails can not be used for another Apple ID. If you make one for each device, you will not have to worry about this limitation. \nFor example, my Apple ID is tied to iCloud and FaceTime and all my devices. I have a separate account for iTunes. I can not set up FaceTime to use the iCloud account and the iTunes account.  \n", "Q: Interference on external VGA monitor (intermittent ripple) only when booted into MacOS X but OK on Windows Bootcamp, why? and how to fix? I'm seeing a ripple-like interference on an external display attached to my 2010 Mac Book Pro via VGA (Display adapter). This only occurs when the Mac is booted into MacOS X but not Windows. It's intermittent may not happen for a period but then comes in short sporadic bursts.\nHow can I stop the interference happening? It has only recently started happening in the last 2 months.\nReason for using (analogue) VGA and not digital HDMI or DVI is that I have a KVM switch that shares the monitor with 2 other machines - one of which only has VGA output.\nThings I've tried already (still seeing the interference):\n\n\n*\n\n*Eliminate the KVM itself from suspicion - connect the monitor direct to the Mac, via VGA no KVM in between\n\n*Re-arranged the power plugs of the various other PCs and devices in case there was some kind of earthing issue\n\n*Disconnected the Mac from the mains, again to see if there was an earthing issue\n\n*Checked drivers and OS up-to-date\n\n*Took Mac to Genius Bar at local Mac Store. They made thorough checks and diagonstics and reset \"PRAM\" etc. They couldn't reproduce my problem on a VGA monitor in-store\n\n\nTried to link the issue to hard disc activity or activities on other devices (DVD, blu-ray burners attached, USB3 Express card) but drawing no conclusions.\nSince taking to Mac store not seeing the interference so much but it did still happen. Their further suggestions are to screen record to verify if the interference is in the digital domain (i.e. happening on the graphics card) or in the analogue domain (which I think is the case), to boot off the install disc (thinking here is driver issue), to check refresh rates of the monitor and try alternatives if possible.\nThe fact that I never see this when the Mac is booted into Windows leads me to believe that there is some kind of driver issue in Mac OS X.\nPerhaps it is telling hardware to put signals on some pins or paths that cause interference. Or perhaps a flaw in the driver software that is involved with the switching between the discrete and integrated graphics cards (which shouldn't happen anyway because the Mac is always on mains power when it happens).\nThoughts?\n\nA: Under OS X, open Terminal.app and enter the following command:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2\n\nThen, reboot your Mac.\nThis will enable subpixel font rendering on non-Apple LCDs. This simple tweak solved a lot of display issues for me back when I was using an external Dell display at work. I hope it helps you, too!\n", "Q: Understanding iPhone Provisioning Portal and how it works? The process of provisioning portal, certificates, provisioning profiles, etc are still confusing me. I read apple's documentations and googled a lot about it.. Nothing helped me..\nI have a Mac and an iPhone. How can I install the application which I developed in Xcode in my device?\nCould anyone give a simple steps to understand the work flow of Provisioning Portal process?\nThanks\n\nA: I faced the same problem too when I started out.\nFor my first app, the steps at Provisioning unveiled worked perfectly for me. \nThe next thing you could try out is distributing your app wirelessly (along with the provisioning profile), which gets very exciting :)\n\nA: The tutorial linked by Hippo in his answer looks perfectly fine, however it doesn't mention a small detail that Apple does. When you're in the step: \n\nTime to request your certificate. Open Spotlight and enter Keychain. Create a new certificate request.\n\nBefore you do the \"Create a new certificate request\", you should go to Keychain's preferences and in the Certificates Tab, turn off both OCSP and CRL. \n\nAfter that, you can safely go to Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority.\n", "Q: How to speed up my iMac (Mid 2007) running Lion I've had this 24\" Al iMac since it came out in August 2007.\n\n\n*\n\n*2.8 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo (X7900 Core 2 Extreme)\n\n*2GB 667 DDR2\n\n\nThe machine has never been rebuilt, and the profile is the original profile from my original iBook G4 back in 2004 (migrated to a MacBook and then to the iMac)\nI'm loath to spend any money on the machine since it is coming up to 5 years old, and I want to save up for a new one later this year.\nI want to know what software tweaks that I can use to speed up the iMac as it is now slow for much of anything except the basics.\nI'm looking for ways to speed up the boot time, runtime memory efficiency, and responsiveness.\nEdit for clarification purposes:\nIf you have any quick fixes, they would score higher for me than say having to rebuild the system (sorry Stuffe)\n\nA: If you don't want to spent money, then that rules out hardware upgrades, which means you are down to software.  You are already running the latest OS (and anecdotally at least for anything reasonably up to date the received wisdom is that you gain a speed boost with new OS releases from Apple on the same hardware) which means you are down to configuration.\nSo, as you say you have never performed a rebuild and you have potentially 9 years of cruft kicking around gathering dust I would simply test out your backup strategy by ensuring you have copies of everything you need, and perform a fresh install, recovering back only that which you are sure you need and still use.\n\nA: By far the best way to \"speed up\" an old computer is to add more RAM.  I believe a 2007 iMac will take up to 4GB of RAM.  It depends on what applications you're running, but if you run multiple tabs on your browser, or more than one application at a time, then odds are, you will notice a speed improvement, as it will spend less time swapping memory to the disk drive (in computer terms, the disk drive is dramatically slower than RAM).\nI noticed this first hand on my wife's early 2008 iMac.  We maxed out the RAM at 4GB a couple years ago and she said World of Warcraft ran much better after that :-).\n\nA: The issue was resolved in the end as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iMac froze and had to be force ably shutdown multiple times\n\n*On rebooting the dreaded flashing question mark appeared\n\n*Booted into Lion Recovery Mode\n\n*In Disk Utility - Repaired Permissions, reset the partition map\n\n\nAfter all that, the machine now starts quickly and applications are much more responsive.\nSo the moral(s) of the story is/are:\n\n\n*\n\n*repairing permissions should be done a lot more regularly than every few years :p\n\n*even after 9 years as a Mac owner and power user, even the little things can surprise you\n\n\nA: If you have a good fast USB flash drive of at least 8GB - 16GB or larger is really the minimum -  to also have apps - you could also try a clean OS install onto it and using that as your boot device.  I don't have your exact model iMac on hand to test, but it might be worth noodling around with, and cheaper/less time invested than upgrading to a SSD.\n", "Q: Getting notified when someone logs into a server using SSH or Remote Desktop I have a mac mini server running OS X Lion Server 10.7.3. It pretty much runs unattended without problems. However, the server is under constant \"attack\" according to the logs. The firewall and security is holding up it seems.\nIs there any application/script that can send me an email whenever someone/anyone logs into the server using SSH, Admin Tools or ARD? \nSince the machine runs unattended, headless in a datacenter in a different city, I'm concerned that someone may (through pure persistance) manages to crack a password or find a compromise on the system. Knowing I'll get alerted will put my mind to ease.\n\nA: Your best defence is always to turn off unnecessary services. If you're not using remote desktop: turn it off. If you're not using the HTTP or FTP servers: turn them off. Fewer services running, fewer points of entry for possibly intruders to exploit.\nAside from locking it down, there are some free and open source products that are OS X friendly you can look at to do intrusion detection on your machine.\nSnort\nThough I haven't personally run it, I do have colleagues who know and trust it for intrusion detection. It's BSD-compatible so it makes a it a good fit for OS X. Another upside to going with Snort is it's available as a Homebrew package:\n> brew info snort\nsnort 2.9.0.5\nhttp://www.snort.org\nDepends on: daq, libdnet, pcre\nNot installed\nhttps://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/snort.rb\n\n==> Caveats\nFor snort to be functional, you need to update the permissions for /dev/bpf*\nso that they can be read by non-root users.  This can be done manually using:\n    sudo chmod 644 /dev/bpf*\nor you could create a startup item to do this for you.\n\nSo you get a simplified path to installation and some trust in the fact that it ports well to OS X and runs there. With Homebrew installed you only need to do:\n> brew install snort\n\nAnd you're ready to get started with it.\nCheck out this Snort for OS X Lion Server setup guide that the Snort community provides to get started with rule writing for your OS X machine. That's a great document and, in addition to walking through installing Snort from source (which you don't need to do), it talks about all the things you should do your OS X Lion Server instance to help protect it. If you install via Homebrew, start at Section 5 (page 13) in the PDF since you don't need to worry about installing it from source code.\nTripwire\nI've run Tripwire on linux machines to do rapid intrusion detection and alerting. It's effective but it's a bit of a beast to set up. It can perform actions when rules are matched against log files. Of course, a savvy hacker is going to know to disable Tripwire as soon as they break in so they don't end up with their session getting cut off.\nThe MacWorld hint talks about setting up Tripwire on OS X. It's not simple and the article ends with mentioning that it's not been tested.\n\nA: You can harden ssh and install denyhosts, sshguard, and Snort, Barnyard, Base and Swatch.\nSee these links for details:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3565475\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4473229?tstart=0\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off root and password logins:\nvi /etc/sshd_config\nPermitRootLogin no\nPasswordAuthentication no\nChallengeResponseAuthenticatio no\nThen use ssh-keygen on the remote client to generate public/private keys that can be used to remotely login to the server:\n \nclient$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C client_name\n[Securely copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub from client to server.]\nserver$ cat id_rsa.pub > ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n \n\n*Install denyhosts and sshguard.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo port install denyhosts sshguard\n\n*sudo port load denyhosts\n\n*sudo port load sshguard\nYou can configure denyhosts to block all traffic, not just ssh traffic.\n\n*Snort, with a world map of attacks:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4473229?tstart=0\n\nA: To directly answer the question posed. I have another script that emails me, again, around midnight, if anyone successfully logs in via ssh.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nmm=`date +%b`\ndd=`date $1 +%d`\ndd=`expr $dd`\nif [ \"$dd\" -ge \"10\" ]\n  then \n    dt=`echo \"$mm $dd\"` \n  else \n    dt=`echo \"$mm  $dd\"` \nfi\n\ncat /var/log/secure.log | grep -E '(Accepted|SUCCEEDED)'| grep -E -v '(my.ip.address|192.168.1)' | grep \"$dt\" >> /tmp/access_granted\n\n/usr/bin/mail -E -s \"Access granted\" email@myserver.com < /tmp/access_granted\nrm /tmp/access_granted\n\nEdit the grep above to exclude your own fixed IP, if you want, and to use your email address. You can combine some of the code in my other answer to add failures for VNC.\n\nA: To expand a bit on Fail2ban, once it is set up and running I have a script that I run just before midnight that scrapes the logs and emails me what Fail2ban has been doing for the previous day.\nThe script is as follows and can be run from cron or a launchd plist.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nmm=`date +%b`\ndd=`date $1 +%d`\ndd=`expr $dd`\nif [ \"$dd\" -ge \"10\" ]\n  then \n    dt=`echo \"$mm $dd\"` \n  else \n    dt=`echo \"$mm  $dd\"` \nfi\n\ncat /var/log/system.log | grep \"$dt\" | grep org.fail2ban | grep -v COMMAND > /tmp/fail2ban_deny\ncat /var/log/fail2ban.log | grep -E '(WARN|ERR|rotation|target)' | grep `date $1 +%Y-%m-%d` >> /tmp/fail2ban_deny\ncat /var/log/ipfw.log | grep TCP | grep \"$dt\" >> /tmp/fail2ban_deny\ncat /var/log/secure.log | grep VNC | grep FAILED | grep \"$dt\" >> /tmp/fail2ban_deny\n\n\n/usr/bin/mail -E -s \"Fail2ban ipfw\" email@yourserver.com < /tmp/fail2ban_deny\nrm /tmp/fail2ban_deny\n\nYou will obviously need to use the email address of your choice.\nSetting up Fail2ban is a whole other issue. I've written extensively about it.\n\nA: It's fairly simple to install Google Authenticator PAM plugin on Mac OS X if you have X code command line compiler installed.  The code and instructions are here:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/wiki/PamModuleInstructions\nOnce you initialize your token (generate a code you feed to the app on your phone), you'll have two factor authentication to protect your machine.  Any account without an initialized token won't be able to login, so if you don't want to allow root login, don't initialize a key for that account.\nBut seriously, something like DenyHosts just makes sense if you have to keep SSH open on the internet.  Unfortunately, since Mac OS X V10.8, Apple's removed tcpwrappers support from the SSH daemon, so it ignores /etc/deny.hosts, which was a dumb move, if you ask me, removing a security feature.\nTo work around that, I used MacPorts to install an up-to-date openssh daemon, and restore the full tcpwrappers functionality, edited and use DenyHosts daemon to monitor /var/log/system.log and ban IPs that are guessing logins and passwords.  And don't forget to update MacPorts and check/reinstall openssh/DenyHosts every time you upgrade the OS.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: I realize that this is an old post but I figured this might help someone that cannot program or save them time scouring the web. I just wrote this on my lunch break and it will email successful and failed attempts as well as blocked IPs via failed attempts. The program is written in Ruby.

In Lion, Quicktime can do screen recordings. Is there a way to capture system audio also and then sync the two tracks into a movie with both system video out (The screen) and system audio out? I own WireTap Studio, which I just upgraded to work with Lion, if that helps. I'm fine using any of the tools that ship with the system and any software I already own (like WireTap) but would rather not go out and buy more software.\n\nA: If you're OK with recording your mic audio and system audio pre-mixed, you could download the free utilities Soundflower and LineIn. Soundflower appears as both an input and output device, and echoes whatever it hears when you send it output to its input. This means that you can set your system output to Soundflower, as well as use LineIn to echo audio from your microphone to Soundflower, and use Soundflower as the audio input to your Quicktime recording.\nThere is one disadvantage to doing this though: because of latency, you don't want to hear yourself on a short delay as you're talking, which means that since you're piping both your computer's audio and your own audio into the same Soundflower device, you're not going to want to monitor it. Which, in turn, means you won't be able to hear the sounds your computer's making (but they will be recorded).\nIf you don't want them premixed, you can use the same setup minus the LineIn to record system audio on the QuickTime screen recording, and use a separate app like Audacity to record the audio from your microphone. You'll have to start the recordings separately and align them by hand in iMovie or whatever you're using to edit. If you're doing this and if you want to hear your system audio, open up SoundflowerBed and from the menu bar drop down select the audio device you want to send the Soundflower audio to.\n\nA: In order to monitor the audio from your application while muting the audio from your mic you can do the folloowing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Soundflower (16 ch) instead of Soundflower (2 ch).\n\n*Direct audio from your microphone to channel 3 of Soundflower (16 ch) via Linein.\n\n*Direct audio from your application to channels 1 and 2 of Soundflower (16 ch).\n\n*Monitor channels 1 and 2 via Soundflowerbed, and do not monitor channel 3.\n", "Q: iPhone will not automatically connect to one particular wifi network There is a wifi in my home (run by landlord - I have no control), which is called \"Default\" and has no encryption enabled.\nI can manually connect to the network from my two iPhones - but whenever an iPhone loses connection, it does not automatically connect again when in range.\nWhat can cause the phone to not automatically connect to a know access point?\nBoth my computers connect and reconnect with no issues.\nI have not seen this behavior with these phones with any other wifi access-points.\nI have tried resetting the network settings to factory defaults on one phone, but it did not make a difference.\nBoth iPhones are up to date with latest iOS updates (5.1) and are not jailbroken or anything out of the ordinary.\n\nA: Let me start this somewhat lengthy soft answer with a suggestion:\nSee if your landlord will allow you to extend his network by allowing you to add an Airport Express in your apartment. This may be the miracle solution you need to what is otherwise likely to be complex and quite possibly unsolvable problem otherwise.\nI strongly suspect you're looking for a technical explanation to your problem. That answer is likely to be lengthy and beyond my expertise. It will also be largely theoretical because without some specific tests performed in your environment, the truth is unlikely to be known, only speculated upon.\nThe practical answer is that sometimes certain access points don't like certain wifi transceivers. Several years ago I had massive wifi problems with my the just-purchased MacBook Pro and a LinkSys wifi router that had been serving the house successfully for years—and still worked fine for all the other computers in the house, including my iMac G5 running the same version of the OS. \nI applied numerous patches and tried various*tricks* on the Mac. I installed  alternative firmwares onto the Linksys. All with no success.\nWe installed an Airport Extreme and all of my wifi woes went away. Instantly.\nIf you're looking for explanation, you'll have to look further. If you want a solution to the problem, see if you can install an AEX, enjoy full use of your device, and don't sweat the details.\n\nA: It's a security feature. \niPhones don't connect to routers that have factory default SSIDs, such as default, linksys, dlink, etc... This protects from the following: as you traverse the world, you will certainly pass by locations that are not customized and therefore have a default SSID with no password. Your iPhone would connect to these networks without you knowing. This is fine and all, unless someone is fishing for people to connect to their network so that they can read the traffic.\nUltimately, connecting to an unknown network is risky.\n\nA: I had this exact same issue.  iPad and iPhone would not automatically connect to my home router.  The problem turned out to be the SSID of the router - default.  Once I changed it to something unique, both devices now automatically connect.\n", "Q: Is there software to mirror a Windows PC via AirPlay? I would like to mirror my Windows PC to my Apple TV via AirPlay. I've found a few options which enable Windows Media Player to receive video via AirPlay. I've also found an application named Airfoil which allows you to stream audio from Windows. I know that the beta of Mountain Lion supports AirPlay mirroring, but is there a Windows option?\n\nA: You can achieve this indirectly if you have an iPad.\nInstall remote control software on the iPad (e.g. Teamviewer) that controls your PC and then use airplay mirroring to display the iPad's screen onto your apple tv.\nHow effective this is will depend upon the type of content you wish to mirror, video is not going to work but static content may be OK.\n\nA: I use a program called AirParrot to mirror my Windows PC to my Apple TV (third generation).

How to get louder Skype audio output on my MacBook Pro? My girlfriend and I are getting really irritated with how quiet Skype is on my new MacBook Pro.  Even with the volume turned up to the max, I can still barely hear her even with my air conditioning and fan off.  \nAt first, I thought about buying a pair of speakers, but even the small USB ones would be irritating to have to have around all the time.  Then I thought of buying a new sound card, but then I realized that iTunes with the preamp in the equalizer set to 12 is actually more than loud enough.\nIs there a way that I could connect to that and make Skype that loud?  Or is there any other way to make it louder?\nOn a smaller note, I've been having the same issue with movies played in Google Chrome.\n\nA: Did you check the settings in the app \"Audio MIDI Setup\"?\nIt's in /Applications/Utilities.\nSometimes the settings there can get out of whack.\n\n\nA: Try the Boom system-wide volume booster tool.  While it's not free, it is cheap: $6.99. See reviews here, here, and here.

I've been nagged to update an iPod to iOS 5 for weeks now. Since it's not mine, I want to be as careful as I can. I'll follow the procedure exactly as Apple recommends, and the device has never been jailbroken. For all intents and purposes, a normal iPod.\nHowever, I'd like to inform this person of all the possible risks that this could have. Since I've never done this upgrade before, I have no idea how it'll go.\nSo, my question to you: What could happen and what is the likelihood that it will?\n(I don't need impossible-to-find statistics, though they might be helpful; I'd just like something like 'Oh yeah, I updated 150 devices and 3 were xyz')\nBTW, this is the second-latest iPod and it currently has iOS 4.latest.\n\nA: Don’t worry about it, nothing will happen.\nIn the off chance that something does go wrong, you’ll always be able to reset the iPod to factory settings and start over with a fresh iOS 5 install.\nIt’s virtually impossible to break an iPod just by upgrading it the recommended way.\n\nA: The worst that could happen is that the iPod could become \"bricked\" (or unusable) during the install process.  This rarely happens, but if it does, it's easily solvable by restoring from iTunes.\nWhat I would suggest would be to create a complete backup of the iPod before you upgrade.  Once you've done that, then I would have no worries about upgrading the software.  Really, unless you're messing around with jailbroken devices, iOS software upgrades are almost always painless.\nI've upgraded all four of my iOS devices. Only one has been jailbroken in the past, but all of them upgraded without a hitch.  So rest easy, and have fun updating your software!\n", "Q: What is the Elo of the Mac Book chess engine at top strength? This will always have to be an approximation, but on a Mac Book Pro with the 2.8 GHz processor, plugged in, and with the engine set to the maximum strength setting, what Elo is it? I don't have direct access to the engine as far as I know, so I can't set it up to run tests against other engines, and doing that manually would be a real pain in the neck. Does anyone know what its Elo is, or if there is another way I could find out? This is assuming that Apple wrote its own chess engine and didn't just use one that was already out there (there are plenty of free, open-source chess engines). I'm also assuming that they don't rewrite the engine with each new version of Lion.\nI was really surprised to see that there was no information about this on Google, and that nobody was even curious. Chess Titans speculation is out there but there is very little on the Apple program, which is surprising, because as an expert player I can handle Chess Titans, but Apple's program is much more challenging.  \nI will upvote guesses, but for the best answer I'd like either the actual Elo (unlikely, since that information probably doesn't exist) or a very educated guess based on tests or some other comparison to other existing chess engines.\nFor those curious about comparing chess engines or chess computer strength in general, check out the Wikipedia article chess engines. \n\nA: The Mac chess app is based on the Sjeng engine.\nA page on the Sjeng website says:\n\nSjeng is probably a bit weaker in bughouse than it is in crazyhouse.\n  Most Sjeng's on the FICS have a rating of about 2000 points in\n  bughouse, with a top of over 2200 points.\nFor standard chess, Sjeng's rating is probably about 2450 ELO [sic]. In\n  suicide and losers chess Sjeng beats all but the very best humans, and\n  will beat non-specialized programs easily.\n\nSo, according to the makers of the engine Apple uses, the Elo is around 2450 in standard mode.\n\nA: From my limited testing and reading it seems to be in the 1600 - 1900 range, but of course I might be completely wrong because I don't play chess that often.\nAs far as I know, there's no information on what the real ELO is.\n\nA: Mac Chess is based on Sjeng's engines for Mac computers. It is one of the most powerful engines in the world available.  At it's highest setting it is able to achieve a staggering rating of approximately 3000+ elo.  See here for references.  \nI can personally vouch for its strength having matched apples chess engine against that of Shredder chess engines (producing a rating of about 2700 elo on my Mac.)  Apple's engine beats shredder nearly every time if the game is not a draw.  It is definitely powerful.\n\nA: I'm doing a little chess software league and I do have Apple Chess competing in it. I'd say 2450 is a realistic estimate for the Sjeng version Apple Chess uses, in my league is loosing 2.5-3.5 against Sigma 6.2, which is rated a little bit over 2500, and 0-4 against Chessmaster 9 (King engine), which stands over 2700; but it does lead 3-1 against Deep Junior 12 Lite ( a lighter version of famous world champion engine) which also ranks around 2500. However, the non-comercial version, Deep Sjeng, the one that competed in World championships and even won a shared title in 2009, has an ELO of 2943, according to computerchess.org.uk, the most competent site for computer chess in my opinion...\n", "Q: Does iChat block content in China? It's relatively common knowledge that the Chinese government blocks certain content in China. Most of this won't affect Chinese users. But does iChat censor messages with said content in them?\nThis Yahoo Answers question says that the content won't be blocked unless it's pornographic or politically extremist. However, I'm not sure if Apple lets China access their messages, so I'm not sure if the Chinese government could do this.\nUnfortunately, I don't have a way to test this myself. I've done some research, and I haven't been able to find a definitive answer, thanks to the fact that I can't read Chinese.\nExample: I send a message to person 1 in China saying 'Down with the government! Tank Man! Tibet! Liu Xiaobo! Tiananmen Square protests of 1989!' Does Person 1 get the message or not?\n\nA: No - iChat has no provision for blocking or filtering what you do.\nIt does rely on DNS and thus is easily blocked by any network operator that chooses to do so. It is vulnerable to blocking of the major chat servers that let people know who else is online. \n\nA: iChat doesn't block anything. On the other hand the Great Firewall of China might block packets containing censored content or trigger alerts to act against users exchanging the data.\niChat had a an option to encrypt communications between users which allowed to keep the communications private as long as the certificates used were not intercepted. But it was removed in Lion and the iCloud transition.\niMessage will probably replace iChat and it is supposed to use an encryption scheme. \nDue to its P2P nature Skype uses an end to end encryption system to avoid intermediate nodes eavesdropping on communications.\n\nA: I did my internship in China and I suffered a lot from the censor. And since I needed unrestricted access to IM's and other information, I bought myself a VPN.  \nThe software will fool the blocking process and pretend to be in an other country. It's how I was sure nothing was blocked and I would get access to the needed sources (Google.com, Facebook.com, YouTube.com,...) \nA good overview of some VPN's can be found here.\n\nA: In any case, I would suggest using the Internet in China only behind a VPN located in Hong Kong. This way no one can stop you from doing nothing online and your speed won't be affected.\n", "Q: How to increase the size of the OS X user interface without lowering the resolution? I can adjust a few things, such as the Dock, but I don't see a way to say, \"I want 1080p resolution, but I'm sitting 5 feet away and want bigger menus, fonts, etc across the entire system.\"\nThis is for a computer to be used as an entertainment center, mac mini 2007 running OS X 10.6.8.\nI can upgrade to Lion if that provides a useful solution.\nHow do I increase the sizes of everything system wide so it's readable from a distance, while keeping the high resolution I desire for movies and games?\n\nA: Better yet, open a terminal and type:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool YES\n\n(enter the admin password).\nLog out and back in, and Bob's yer uncle.\n\nA: As of Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8), the HiDPI feature is no longer experimental. It's available in standard installs of the OS, without messing around with developer tools. But it still doesn't work as well as I'd like for this purpose, because if you're using a TV at the normal full HD resolution (1080P, or 1920x1080), the HiDPI resolution of 960x540 is too small for a lot of apps. iTunes, the Mac App Store, and even the Mountain Lion installer and welcome screens either force scrollbars on all screens (annoying) or truncate content without letting you scroll to see it (even worse).\nHiDPI is probably the only answer to this problem we're going to get from Apple, but it's really not the right one. It would be nice if people would design their apps to run well at 960x540, but I'm not betting on it.\n\nA: There is a feature that's currently experimental called HiDPI that may do what you want. Like the retina displays on the iPhone and iPad, HiDPI mode creates a \"logical\" resolution that's half the current resolution on your display but uses all the physical pixels to keep the image sharp. This results in all the user interface elements appearing much larger, but with no lack in clarity. For example, if you're outputting to a 1080p TV with a resolution of 1920x1080, the HiDPI resolution would be 960x540, and all the elements on the screen would be the same size as if you were outputting that physical resolution.\nTo enable HiDPI mode in Mac OS X Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the \"Graphics Tools for Xcode\" download from Apple. This download requires you to enter an Apple ID, which you most likely have and can get for free.\n\n*Mount the DMG\n\n*Open the \"Quartz Debug\" app\n\n*In the menu bar, select \"Window\", then \"UI Resolution\"\n\n\n*Check \"Enable HiDPI display modes\"\n\n*You'll be prompted to log out and log back in. If multiple accounts are logged in, they must all log out for the change to work.\n\n*Once you log back in, go to System Preferences, then Displays. You will see the new HiDPI modes there.\n\n\n*For your 1080p TV, select \"960x540 (HiDPI)\"\nP.S. If you're curious what HiDPI mode looks like, the screenshots I've taken are both in HiDPI. Click on them to see them full sized.\n\nA: You can also enable the HiDPI modes without Quartz Debug by changing DisplayResolutionDisabled to DisplayResolutionEnabled in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist and logging out and back in.\nThe maximum effective resolutions are half of the native resolutions.\n\n", "Q: Is upgrading to iOS 5 faster on a Mac? As I've mentioned in another question, I want to upgrade an iPod 4th gen to iOS 5. It's currently on iOS 4.latest.\nI'm interested in doing this in the fastest possible time. However, I right now all I have are 2 PCs around. However, I'll soon get access to a Mac.\nI know (edit:Okay, it apparently is) it's  that iTunes on a Mac is not the bloated, slow, ugly monstrosity it is on a PC. In fact, it's quite decent on a Mac. Tons of features are faster and cleaner-looking.\nSo, my question: Will updating to iOS 5 on a Mac be faster than doing it on a PC?\n\nA: For what it's worth, iTunes is probably exactly the most bloated and slow software that Apple includes on a Mac, as it's pretty much the only built in app that isn't 64 bit, and until very recently it wasn't even using Cocoa but Carbon APIs which Apple have been telling people not to use for years now.\nHaving said that, the largest bottleneck is the speed of the USB transfer along with the ability of the iphone to process the update and write to its flash memory and validate it etc, so really I wouldn't expect to see a massive difference.\n\nA: If you find iTunes is running slow on your PC, of course, just starting up iTunes will be faster on the Mac. But the iOS 5 upgrade process will be just as fast on both devices. The bottleneck in this case is the network connection (to download iOS 5). Then, the installation process takes place on the iPod itself, not on the PC/Mac.\n", "Q: Best way to see multiple Microsoft Word windows? I just made the switch from Windows to Mac, and one thing that's been bothering me is that on a Mac, I can't see multiple Word documents that I have open.  On Windows, they all appear in the taskbar (after checking the option to not collapse instances of the same program) and I can quickly switch between them, which is useful for a variety of reasons.  On a mac, I can't do that.  The best way I've discovered so far is to go into mission control, but then I still have to make two gestures instead of one, and it's hard to see which window is which.  What's the best way to do this?\n\nA: App Exposé\nTrigger using swipe gesture:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences → Trackpad → More Gestures → App Exposé\nTrigger using keys or mouse:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences → Mission Control\n\nDock Icon:\n\n*\n\n*You can trigger App Exposé by right-clicking the Word icon in the Dock and choosing the option Show All Windows.\n\nAlternatively you can cycle all Windows of the same application using:\n\n*\n\n*⌘+~ (US keyboard layout)\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Hyperdock will give you window previews of each open window\nbelonging to an application by hovering over the dock icon, which you\ncan then click to activate.\n\n\n*Witch has a popup panel that displays the open\nwindows belonging to an application and also gives you a preview if\nyou hover over it.\n \n\n*Fantasktik probably offers the most\nsimilar functionality to the Windows taskbar. However, the original\ndeveloper seems to have disappeared and this hasn't been updated in a\nwhile (and therefore probably won't ever be). The new\n\"owner\" claims it works on Lion, so it might be worth a try.\n\n\nA: You can use ⌘ + ~ to toggle between multiple windows of the same app.\nThis is an OS X-wide keyboard shortcut, so it works in Word for Mac 2011, too.\n\nA: In system preferences you can turn on the gesture for Application Exposè which is essentially Mission Control but only for either the current application or the one your cursor was hovering over in the dock at the time.\nThis should make it easier to see what it what, but overall it's simply not realistic to force Windows methods of UI interaction onto a Mac desktop.  For every person switcher wanting to see a Dock icon per document window are a probably more non-switchers who want to use the Mac method of seeing an icon for the app, and one for each minimised windows - unless even this is switched off and the document minimise to the app icon.\nIt's one of the fundamental difference between the Doc and the Task Bar.  The Dock is an application launcher/switcher, and a minimised window holder.  The Task Bar is essentially an area for any and all running Windows.\n", "Q: Any performance gains when disabling secure virtual memory? To disable secure virtual memory in 10.7, one does the following:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.virtualMemory DisableEncryptedSwap -boolean yes\n\nHowever, are there any benefits to disabling secure system memory?  I'm not concerned with security as much as I 'm concerned about system speed.\n\nA: According to MacWorld, the advantage of disabling encrypted swaps should be “just a slightly less overhead on the page in & out process”.\nSo yes, there is a minor performance gain, but it won’t be a huge performance boost. To me, it’s not worth the security risk (of potentially having unencrypted passwords and other sensitive data in swap memory).\nYou’d get a much bigger performance boost if you’d disable virtual memory completely:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\nTo re-enable it:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\n", "Q: An iPhone has been detected, but it could not be identified properly Why do I get the following message in iTunes when syncing my iPhone(s)/iPad(s) to iTunes wirelessly on Windows Vista Ultimate?\n\nAn iPhone has been detected, but it could not be identified properly.  Please disconnect and reconnect the iPhone, then try again.\n\nWhenever I sit down at my Windows machine after being away for a while with iTunes running, I get several of these popups I need to dismiss before I can do anything in iTunes.\n\nA: First thing is to Uninstall iTunes, get rid of it entirety.\nReinstall from Apple\nPlug your iPhone in\nIt should now work fine.\nIf not follow the online troubleshooting assistant on Apple's website here\n\nA: Disabling wireless syncing is what fixed the problem for me. My theory is it has something to do with the pass code lock. It doesn't like it if you try to plug it in and sync with it locked by a pass code. I bet its the same thing with wireless. I will have to leave the pass code lock off over night with iTunes running and see if that makes a difference. \n\nA: I logged out of iTunes, iCloud, on all devices, then logged in again. Fixed the problem\n", "Q: How do I install Intel's ifortran and MKLs on Mac OS X? I need to install Intel's ifortran and Math Kernel Libraries (MKL) on OS X 10.7 Lion, available (for non-commercial use) here. Has anyone experience in doing so? Or should I rather setup a virtual Linux instead?\n\nA: The non commercial tools all appear to be for Linux ony so you will need to use the VM.\nAlthough TBB is available for OS X.\n", "Q: How can I download photos from Photo Stream onto a new iPad? I bought a new iPad and I want to download all my photos from Photo Stream there. How do I do that?\nCurrently, it only syncs newly taken photos, but not all those taken in the past which are available in Photo Stream through my other devices.\n\nA: Photostream isn't really a synchronise mechanism, it's a push mechanism.\nWhen you take a new photo on any iCloud enabled device with Photostream turned on, it will inform whatever gubbins sits in the cloud which then accepts an upload of that photo, and pushes it out to other devices which are also registered.\nAs such it can never cater for pictures that were taken before the device was registered to use the service.  It has no way of performing the checking to see if you already have the photo, or options to perform what would effectively be 2 way sync at all, it has precisely no knowledge of your previous photos, and will merely start throwing down photos that are new after being registered to receive the updates.\nSo, in short, you can't.  To give you an analogy, it's like iMessages.  When you register a new device to receive messages, it picks up from that point onwards, and doesn't catch up on your previous history of messages.\n\nA: Unfortunately, PhotoStream does not always add photos taken before it was enabled. \nA few ways around this would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the images into iPhoto or Aperture (I have only tried in Aperture), and add them to PhotoStream\n\n*Open the photo and take a screen shot of the picture, which would then add it to PhotoStream. (although, this would majorly reduce the resolution and probably not the best idea).\n\n\nA: On your PC, simply copy your photo stream photos across to your 'upload' folder in My Pictures and they will all resync with your devices.\n\nA: Just wanted to add my solution to the mix.\nI had the same problem, I upgraded my iPad from 16gb generation 3 to 32gb generation 4. I had nearly 800 photos on the iPad Photostream and when I had finished setting up the new one I had 27 recent photos on the gen 4 iPad... What to do?\nI opened Aperture (Mac) and clicked on Photostream and all the photos were still there, so that was good news. I then created a New Project in Aperture and named it \"Temporary\".\nThen clicked on Photostream again and selected Edit>Select All.\nThen I dragged and dropped the whole 800 photos into the new Temporary Project.\nI checked Photostream and Temporary and the photos were all there in both places.\nThen I clicked on Temporary to reveal the photos and clicked Edit>Select All\nThen I dragged and dropped the whole lot back to Photostream. It didn't duplicate the photos, it seemed to recognise they were all there.\nThen I went back to the new iPad and opened Photostream and lo and behold it was populating it with the 800 photos. It took a while to complete but they are now all there.\nI can only assume that the copying back to Photostream fooled it into thinking they were all new photos, which is exactly what I thought might happen.\nFinally I went back to Aperture and deleted the Temporary Project to clean things up.\nProblem solved, just takes a little time.\n\nA: I have this problem and being a simple soul I have e mailed my photos to myself a few at a time from my old iPad opened the e Mail on the new ipad and then saved the images - they turn up on camera roll and photo stream on my new iPad. Not good if you have thousands I guess but better than losing your favourites. \n", "Q: Can sudo use my existing aliases? How can I let sudo use my existing aliases in my .bash_profile (or .bashrc, .profile …)?\nFor example I want to be able to use ll instead of ls -laGF as sudo.\n\nA: alias sudo='sudo su -i ENV=/home/myuser/.profile'\n\nA: No. Sudo draws from the root account and won't consult your user's ~/.bash_profile.\nBut you can workaround this problem by adding the following alias to your profile:\nalias sudo='sudo '\n\n*Note the space after the command. From then on, sudo will work normally and you'll be able to use your user's aliases without issue (both normally and with root privileges).\n\nExplanation: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Aliases says:\n\nIf the last character of the alias value is a space or tab character, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.\n\n", "Q: iPhone save PDF file and view it I have a PDF file on my Mac and I want to copy it into my iPhone and then read it.\nHow can I do that?  \nI already tried to plug the iPhone cable into my Mac, but it seems Finder doesn't let me save a file onto it. Before I had an iPhone, I used a Windows phone and could simply transfer my file to the phone and view it.\nDo I need additional software? I have an iPhone 4S running iOS 5.1.\n\nA: You need to use iTunes to transfer it to the app on your iPhone that will take ownership of it. The simplest solution is to use iBooks, which you can find in the App Store on your iPhone if you haven't downloaded it already:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the PDF into iTunes\n\n*Select your device on in the left hand pane, then select \"Books\" on the top. \n\n*Make sure \"Sync Books\" is checked, and if you're syncing selected books, check the check box by the PDF you just added.\n\n*Hit Apply\n\n\nThe PDF should now be in iBooks on your iPhone.\n\nA: If you use Dropbox, you could save the PDF file from your Mac, and (after Dropbox syncs) read that PDF file from the Dropbox app on your iPhone.\nProvided you have internet connection, the pros:\n\n\n*\n\n*you only need one copy of the file (at Dropbox) without creating\nduplicates and using up memory.\n\n*you can replace a PDF with an updated PDF and let Dropbox takes\ncare of sync'ing it to your other devices.\n\n*Dropbox is free\n\n*iTunes not needed (and if you set iTunes to backup the device on your Mac's hard disk, then the PDF file(s) will use up hard disk space).\n\n\nThe cons are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox does have a limit to how much storage it allows for free\n\n*you need internet connection and will incur telco's data charges unless you use WiFi.\n\n\nA: You don't need any extra software. \nThe best way to do this would just be to email yourself the PDF. The iPhone can open the PDF in the email, and display it. \nYou can also use apps like GoodReader to open it as well, so that you can somewhat store it on the phone. If you have that app (or some others) installed on your phone, you can hold down on the PDF icon in the email to save it and open it in one of those apps. If you have one of these apps installed too, you can drag the PDF to the app in iTunes when syncing your phone (although, this is much more complicated than it needs to be).\niBooks also lets you save and read PDF's. You do the same as above, either hold down on the PDF icon, or when its open, click the share (looks like an arrow coming out of a box) button to open in another app. (Its the icon in the bottom left of this picture)\n\nAs for where you note that you don't see the iPhone drive, iOS doesn't do this like Windows and Android phones do. You may be able to enable the iPhone as a drive, but it can't access that data, without possibly jailbreaking or the like. \n\nA: Just to add on, some apps which allow PDF viewing for iPhones ( eg: GoodReader, USBdisk, FileApp ) also have an option to transfer files via FTP, which is essentially keying in a specific IP address shown in the app into your browser and then browsing for the file you want to transfer. \nThis eliminates the need for the cumbersome iTunes just for a PDF transfer =)\n", "Q: How to acknowledge updates count on iPhone? When there is a new update on the iPhone, I get a number next to Settings, emails or App Store icon.\nI like to see the count when something changes but when I've checked it, I would like it to disappear.  For instance, I know there is an update for iOS 5.1.  But as my iPhone is jailbreaked, I want to wait until the jailbreak is done (which can take weeks or even month).  That said, each time I login my iPhone, the first thing I see is this red circle displaying '1' to tell me \"hey check here, we have something new!\".\nIs there a way to acknowlegde it to stop displaying it ?\n\nA: There is no built in mechanism in iOS that will clear this, except installing the updates. \nFor jailbroken devices there is an app called Update Hider. \n", "Q: How does iTunes make its decision as to what artwork to provide? I'm trying to download Album Art by right-clicking a track in iTunes and choosing Get Album Artwork.  Sometimes this works fine, but sometimes iTunes finds the wrong Album.  \nAs an example, I have A Taste Of Things To Come from the Mortal Kombat Soundtrack.:\n\nBut this is the only track on that same album with Album Art, so I ask iTunes to Get Album Art for the second track.  This is what it finds:\n\nThe Quigley soundtrack, starring Gary Busey and Oz Perkins.  \nHow does iTunes make its decision as to what artwork to provide for any given track?  And ideally, how can I encourage iTunes to make better choices?\nI'm running iTunes 10.6.0.40 on a Windows 7 PC. \n\nA: iTunes uses an external site to search for album art.  I don't remember exactly which site it is, but I do remember that it was crowdsourced, so there's a high likelihood that, especially with relatively rare music, it will get the wrong thing. \n\nA: This seems to be an ongoing problem with iTunes and MP3s.  It'll get better for awhile, then suddenly a ton of threads on it will pop up on apple's support boards.  It might improve a little, but many will still report problems.\nEven when the ID3 tags match exactly with the information for the same album in the iTunes store people indicate they are still getting mismatches or missing artwork.  Others have complained that after going through and painstakingly attaching artwork manually to all the songs that had missing artwork, a later iTunes upgrade has removed some or all of the artwork they added.\nThe problem is so pervasive that there are apparently several programs intended to do the work that iTunes should be doing itself:\nhttp://www.rinsemymusic.com/\nhttp://www.tuneupmedia.com/\nOthers\nI suspect that you won't find an easy solution to this problem with songs not purchased from Apple.\n\nA: Unfortunately, when iTunes doesn't do it right, you have to reside to third-party apps to do the dirty work. I have found this a useful piece of advice regarding missing iTunes artwork.\nThis only proves that no artwork-finder app is perfect and applies data 100% correctly, especially iTunes. In my case, iTunes did not find more than 100 of my album artworks: \n\nA: Yes, it could be a problem for songs not puchased from the Store. I advise to store a covers with all full albums / compilations you have. I do so and haven't these situations because I add the covers when I edit meta info of the files (using The Tagger utility).\n\nA: Clearly, the database being polled either has errors or the mix of the data used to determine the track listing isn't uniquely specified which leads to the errors.\nHere is what you have in your control:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually override these artworks by hand or by using a competing service. There are many and I've never found them to be worthwhile for the music I have issues with. YMMV of course and I know several people really love these iTunes add-on programs and cleaners.\n\n*The metadata - you can edit the title or the author or any of the other music tag information on the problematic tracks to better match what Apple sells the music. If you have a Jimmy Buffet album labeled \"stoner rock\" for genre - perhaps changing it to \"Rock\" would be the difference in retrieving the correct artwork.\n\n\nAs you can see, the details aren't public, so some trial and error may be needed. If you have the actual CD and can re-encode them, usually this gets the data correct for matching with artwork.\n\nA: itunes just gets confused sometimes i guess, an easy solution is to go to google, copy the album art you want and go to the album you want to change in itunes. click on advanced and add album art (top left hand corner). then you go to album art i believe and control and copy/paste the picture into the album art space. this allows you to get custom art work! \n-:) iph4u on Youtube! \n", "Q: Is RAM upgrade worth it if I have an SSD already? I recently purchased a Macbook Pro.  I had an SSD from my last computer which I formatted, installed into my Mac, and used as my one and only HD (I don't need that much space so I didn't opt to do the upgrade where people pull out their optical drive).\nI'm not much of a hardware guy - my knowledge is limited to basic understanding of where my data is hiding and how to swap parts.  I do work in Eclipse though, and I'm noticing that my RAM usage is near 100% (I still have the default 4gb installed).\nI'm considering going for the 8gb install, but I'm wondering, Is upgrading the RAM worth it if I have an SSD already?  I know that when RAM is full it will use swap space on the hard drive so I don't know if it would benefit me to get an SSD or not...\nI know there are some similar questions out there, but they all seem to focus on \"Should I get RAM or SSD.\"  I've got the SSD, I just want to know if the RAM would provide any increase in performance.\n\nA: On MacPerformance.com  look for Optimizing the MacBook Pro Core i7 on the home page. It's a 5 part article that compares combinations of 4/8 GB memory with & without an SSD.\nJust eye-balling the graphs, and other random experience guessing,  I'd say\n\n\n*\n\n*Given 8 GB memory, an SSD is absolutely worth while.\n\n*If you have 4 GB memory, upgrade memory first\n\n*If you have 8 GB memory, upgrade to an SSD\n\n*For Joe Average User, once you have an SSD upgrading beyond 8GB memory is virtually pointless.\n\n\nOther points specific to recent MBP models\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the SSD the boot drive. (not MBP specific)\n\n*Get an SSD w/ 6G (speed) interface, vice 3G.\n\n*The MBP main drive slot has a 6G interface, the CD-ROM slot has a 3G interface\n\n*Don't put a 6G drive in the CD-ROM slot. It's buggy. Also a waste of $ of the premium for a 6G SSD. See MacPerformanceGuide.com for more info.\n\n\nA: RAM still is a lot faster than any SSD which you use in your Mac. RAM has a shorter access times and much higher transfer rates:\n\n[table]\nThe SATA interface by which the hard disk is connected limits the throughput to a theoretical maximum of 6Gbit/s (600MB/s) for SATA3.\nYou can determine how much the page outs are written to the disk by taking a look at the Activity Monitor. I try to keep the ratio at a maximum of 10/1 (page in/page out). The more page outs you have, the more like a RAM upgrade will benefit you.\n\n\nA: This is hard to say, without knowing exactly how you use your computer it's difficult to suggest exactly what the outcome will be, but one thing is for sure your performance will not decrease if you throw more RAM in ;)\nHaving said that, if you had an issue with low RAM, one of the things you can expect to see is more virtual memory paging.  If you already have an SSD, then that paging process is likely to be considerably better performing than for an normal HD.\nAs such it's possible that the SSD is already making up for low RAM by paging much faster.  The boost you may get from more RAM will be lower than if you had a spinning magnetic platter.\n\nA: It depends what you want to do. Your computer's memory and its storage are used in different situations — and thus performance improvements will affect different aspects of your workflow.\n\n\n*\n\n*Memory (RAM) is used to keep track of data used by currently running applications.\nUpgrading your RAM will improve your ability to work with many applications at the same time, and open/work with large files. Your computer will feel more responsive.\n\n*Storage (SSD or HDD) is used for long-term file storage, and manipulation of files which don't fit in memory. Also, if your system memory is full, a swapfile is used to extend the memory using your disk.\nUpgrading your HDD to an SSD will make downloads and other file operations faster, and in some cases it may make applications more responsive. It also has the benefit of no moving parts, so your computer will be more robust against sudden motion.\nBut note: SSDs are still slower than RAM! If you're using more memory than your system has physical RAM, upgrading to an SSD may improve the speed of virtual memory (your swapfile), but you won't see the same improvement as you would if you add more RAM. Plus, the less swapping you do, the less wear you incur on your disk.\n\nA: I consider 4GB OK for current general Mac usage. 8GB is better, 16GB is what I currently have (although not \"officially\" supported in a current MacBook Pro, it works well and OWC sells a kit). You just can't have too much RAM. Right now it is relatively very cheap, compared to what we used to have to pay.\nEven if you have a SSD, paging (virtual memory) is still considerably slower than having RAM available. Memory-hungry apps like Photoshop, Xcode and Safari on a system will be noticeably faster on any system where they are able to access all the memory they need rather than having to go to virtual memory. In fact the presence of any two of those apps is more than enough justification for me to install 8GB.\nI would rather have the RAM upgrade than the SSD.\n\nA: The question the OP is asking is will having extra RAM increase performance when the MacBook is using the SSD for the swap file.\nSSD is fast. Yes, RAM is faster but, come on, we're talking milliseconds here, so it's not going to be noticeable to the average user. So why fork out cash for extra RAM when you won't notice any difference?\n\nA: I have 2 identical systems, except one with 2GB+SSD, and the other 6GB+HDD.\nI find the SSD system just as fast if not faster\n", "Q: Am I allowed to install Snow Leopard on my MBP using someone elses install disc? I bought a 2009 Macbook Pro 13\" used from someone and it doesn't have the install disc for Snow Leopard which is currently installed.  If I have to restore the computer someday can I use a friends Snow Leopard Install Disc? \nI'm not sure how the licensing works.  All I know is right now I have a legit version of Snow Leopard on the computer. The install disc's are like $50 and I don't want to buy one unless I have to.\n\nA: Yes, if it's an install disc that was either a boxed copy, or an up-to-date CD, no if it was just the disc that came with the machine unless the model number of the machine is the exact same one.\nThere are no license keys or otherwise.\nYou may not be able to install bundled versions of iLife as they are often locked to the machine it was bought from (but even this is get-roundable by showing package contents and using the individual packages rather than the wrapper installer), but the OS is usually fine.\nI think the only install media that isn't usable across a number of systems are the Lion USB installers which I believe are tied down at serial number granularity.\nFrankly, if you are worried about licensing, just upgrade to Lion for $30.\n\nA: No.\nFrom your question I understand that you want to use his install disks for your computer. No matter if they came shipped with that computer or he bought it as an upgrade - the Snow Leopard single licence may only be installed on one of your Macs at a time.\nGenerally, it's possible to use the install disks on another computer. But this depends on the licence you got.\n\n*\n\n*The install disks shipped with the hardware may only be used with that hardware.\n\n*The Snow Leopard Upgrade single licence may only be use with one computer.\n\n*The Snow Leopard Upgrade family licence may be use with up to five computers.\n\nThis is what the Software License Agreement for Firmware Restoration CD 1.9 says:\n\nSection 3: Transfer\nYou may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Apple Software. You may, however, make a one-time\npermanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Apple Software\nto another party, provided that: (a) the transfer must include all of\nthe Apple Software, including all its component parts, original media,\nprinted materials and this License; (b) you do not retain any copies\nof the Apple Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a\ncomputer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the\nApple Software reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of\nthis License. All components of the Apple Software are provided as\npart of a bundle and may not be separated from the bundle and\ndistributed as standalone applications.\n\nVersion 1.8 of the Agreement is more specific about Restore Copies:\n\nRestore CDs or DVDs that may accompany an Apple hardware bundle, or are otherwise provided by Apple in connection with an Apple hardware bundle, contain a copy of the Apple Software that is to be used for diagnostic and restorative purposes only. These CDs and DVDs may be resold or transferred only as part of the Apple hardware bundle.\n\nNote: There are different versions of this agreement depending on what hardware/software you have.\n\nA: The letter of the EULA says the friend \"may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Apple Software\".  That agreement binds the friend, though, not you.\nIf you believe you acquired a license to Snow Leopard when you bought the computer - i.e., the former owner had truly lost the install disks; not just retained them to reuse them - then functionally, you have the right to re-install Snow Leopard.  A bill of sale from the former owner would tend to confirm this. Technically you're supposed to have your own disk(s) to do it but I can't imagine Apple caring.  EULAs are generally intended to prevent piracy, not to block legitimate use in the face of technical difficulties.\nObviously, this is my personal opinion and I doubt there is language in the EULA to support it, but I would have no concerns that were Apple to discover such a re-installation, that they would care about it.  (That's not to say that asking one of their lawyers for permission mightn't get you a formal refusal; lawyers are paid to hold the letter of the [law, agreement, contract, what have you], not to interpret it [unless there's some money to be made? -- but maybe that's just my cynicism!]).\nBottom line: if I got stuck, I'd go ahead and do it with a clear conscience.  But if it were me, thinking ahead about it as you are, then for only 30 bucks, I'd just buy a retail install disk right now today, and rest securely in the knowledge that I'm prepared to maintain or repair my OS, no matter when, where, or what.\n", "Q: Do I really need Bonjour on Windows? One of my least favorite things that Apple does to every Windows computer during an installation of iTunes is that it installs Bonjour. On almost every Windows machine I've installed iTunes on, Bonjour has caused an error of some sort.\nAs far as I can remember, I've removed Bonjour by deleting the folder it's in. Most of the time, this has not caused any major problems. However, I have a new installation of iTunes and I'm wondering if once again I should delete Bonjour.\nAre there any issues caused by deleting Bonjour? Would I lose any functionality?\n\nA: You don't need it, about the only thing I have ever actually used it for in a Windows machine is to enable printing to a printer attached to my Airport Extreme.  In fact because of the unusual port range it uses, I have actually encountered issues with VPNs that have refused to work properly until it is uninstalled, so I actually remove is as a matter of course.\nOf course if you do magically require it later down the line, you can always install it as an individual package.\n\nA: From Apple's knowledge base article about Bonjour on Windows (my emphasis):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*iTunes uses Bonjour to find shared music libraries, to find AirPort Express devices for streaming music to, and to find Apple TVs.\n  \n*Safari uses Bonjour to find devices advertising web pages on your network. Many of today's network printers, network cameras, and wireless gateways provide a web interface for status and configuration, and many of these devices (especially network printers) now advertise those web pages using Bonjour, to make them easily discoverable in Safari.\n  \n*Internet Explorer, via the Bonjour toolbar plugin, also provides easy discovery of Bonjour-advertised web pages.\n  \n*The Bonjour Printer Setup Wizard uses Bonjour to discover and set up Bonjour-advertised network printers.\n  \n*Adobe's Creative Suite 3 applications use Bonjour to discover digital asset management services.\n  \n\nIf you don't use any features, then removing Bonjour won't cause you any trouble (except perhaps Apple Software Update might offer to install it again...)\nFurthermore, this page has some instructions for more throughly uninstalling Bonjour.\n\nA: You are able to use \"[computer name].local\" domains all over your network. This also applies to Apple mobile devices and other hardware (I have: Mac Mini, Western Digital NAS, HP printer and Linux laptop -- it has its own Bonjour called Avahi).\nPlease support adoption of the Zeroconf protocol and report bugs to Apple, because they give us an opportonity to drop the horrible NetBIOS technology and to connect across different platforms.\n", "Q: How can I figure out which tab in Safari is using CPU? I usually have several tabs open in Safari in the background, and sometimes I see it taking up an unusual amount of CPU (PluginProcess or WebProcess).\nHow can I figure out which tab (or tabs) is causing this? If there are no easy GUI solutions, I'm also open to Terminal-based techniques for finding the culprit. I hope not to have to do this very often.\n(Note: I realize this is similar to an old question, but Safari has been updated since then and perhaps there are new techniques available.)\n\n\nA: The Activity Monitor app provides entries for individual Safari tabs. You can search for “Safari” in it to see just Safari-related processes, including all its tabs, and sort by CPU percentage to see which ones are active.\nUnfortunately, each process name only includes the domain of the URL, rather than the full URL, so it can be a bit tricky to work out which tab it is if, like me, you have lots of pages open from the same domain.\n(I’m on macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and Safari 10.1.2; I’m not sure when this was introduced.)\n\n\nA: For what it’s worth, I’ve checked both the Develop menu and the Debug menu in the latest Safari.app (Version 5.1.4 / 7534.54.16), and couldn’t find any helpful features.\nDevelop menu:\n\nDebug menu:\n\nThe debug menu can be enabled using the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu -bool true\n\n\nA: cmd ⌘+alt ⌥+A ⇔ Window > Activity may help you to identify which tab is the heaviest in activity if it is lasting long enough.\nI must admit that all my tests where failure, but I'm mostly using web servers which are fast.\nI also tested Debug > Show Frame Rate Meter (see Mathias Debug dropdown menu) which is a partial answer to the original question. You have to test it by reloading every tab and compare the output of the 3 meters to see who is the hog.\n\nA: *\n\n*You need Safari 6.1 or newer\n\n*Enable Debug menu.\nUpdate: For Mac OS Mojave and newer, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access and add Terminal before entering the command.\n    defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu -bool true\n\n\n\n*Set \"Use Per-tab web processes\" and \"Show Web process IDs in page titles\" to on.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to import DVD's to iTunes I will be traveling long haul over a few times over the next few weeks and would like to watch some TV series I have on DVD, using an iPad, but do not want to have to purchase it again on iTunes.\nSo, is it possible to burn a DVD into iTunes for later viewing on iPad?\n\nA: You can use Handbrake to rip it to a file, then just copy to iTunes. Handbrake is free and has a very simple to use interface. Just select the DVD in the file browser,  choose a preset and you'll be on your way.\n\n\nA: iTunes doesn't support ripping DVDs itself, but you can use other software to do so, then import the file into iTunes and sync it to your device.\nHandbrake\nHandbrake supports many formats and includes presets for many types of devices (to optimize resolution & quality for performance).\n\n\nA: Handbrake is a very nice, but somewhat difficult tool to use.  You've got to also download VLC, and if you get the newest version, you need an additional library.  It's not hard, but it's not point and click.  For that reason, I'm going to throw RipIt into the mix.  It's not free (there are free trials.) They're a small app developer, and it's a good product.  I use it for the few times Handbrake fails.  \n", "Q: Xcode 4.2 install for Snow Leopard fails with an OpenGLApps.pkg During an install of XCode 4.2 for Snow Leopard (this is on a brand new install of Mac OSX that has been updated to the latest OSX version), I'm getting the following error in the /var/log/install.log file.\nFailed install preflight: Error Domain=PKInstallErrorDomain Code=102\nUserInfo=0x1003c46b0 \"The package “OpenGLApps.pkg” is untrusted.\" Underlying \nError=(Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-2147409654 UserInfo=0x1003b1f10\n\"The operation couldn’t be completed. CSSMERR_TP_CERT_EXPIRED\")\n\nThe installer indicates a generic error and suggests to try the install again or contact the vendor.\nBased on the entry in install.log, I'm guessing that there may be a way to force the OpenGLApps package to ignore the cert check.\nThis install was downloaded today from apple's developer website under Other Downloads.\n\nA: Dave, your post and subsequent answer were just what I needed, and very refreshing indeed.  I was getting the same error and log output, trying to install Xcode 3.2.6 with iOS 4.3 on OS 10.6.8 (the untrusted package in this case was iPhoneSDKTools.pkg).  I had tried a bunch of other things, to no avail.\nWhen I followed your suggestion and checked for updates, it listed one for Safari (including some security-related fixes) plus another for the Application Installer (or something similar) - the description for that mentioned something about fixing problems installing certain apps on 10.6.8!  After doing those updates the Xcode install finally worked.  I'm pretty sure it was the Application Installer.  I didn't have to download a fresh Xcode installer, I just used the one I'd been trying to use all along.\nOther posts I'd found recommended reinstalling Snow Leopard, which seemed a bit extreme and didn't answer why it was happening.  I think you've hit on the real issue and a nice straightforward easy solution.  Thanks.  I can now abandon my plans to leap into the Abyss.\n\nA: After updating Safari and other applications, the Xcode installation was able to proceed.\n", "Q: How to kill stuck Screen sharing authentication dialogue? Sometimes when connecting to a screen sharing machine in Finder, the authentication dialogue hangs indefinitely. The only way I've been able to get rid of it is log out.\nSo far I've tried killing a number of processes including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen Sharing\n\n*Finder\n\n*Dock\n\n*SystemUIServer\n\n\nTo no avail. Any idea what process this UI is attached to?\n\nA: Yes, it's called NetAuthAgent.\nYou can tell I've had this problem before! :(\n", "Q: What functionality of iTunes is not available anywhere else? I commonly use iTunes to add items to iPods and iPhones. However, I'm using Ubuntu more and more and I'm really liking it.\nUbuntu has some apps that replicate iTunes, but some features are either hard-to-find or missing. So my question:\nWhat functionality of iTunes is not available anywhere else?\n\nA: iTunes match is a huge feature for the iCloud integration features for easy streaming and syncing of playlists and metadata across iOS and Mac/PC. Ping is unique, though few would argue this is highly useful. \n\nA: The principal functionality that is not available anywhere else is that iTunes.app is the front end to the iTunes Store, giving you the ability to purchase and rent music, videos, books and apps sold by Apple, Inc. You can't buy any of what they sell unless you have iTunes.\n\nA: iTunes has no unique functionality. Pretty much anything else is better than iTunes, except maybe Windows Media Player.\n", "Q: AirPrint doesn't work with router that has DD-WRT installed Years ago, AirPrint worked in my house on my current printer. It's an HP Photosmart Premium and it absolutely does support AirPrint.\nThen a year or two ago, I installed DD-WRT on my Linksys WRT160N router. I installed it so I could add a guest wireless network, but I probably shouldn't have, because the technical specifics of networking that I see everywhere on the DD-WRT site and forums are mostly over my head.\nSoon thereafter, I noticed that AirPrint didn't work anymore. I searched and searched for things I could try to fix it, but what few answers I found either didn't work or assumed too high a level of networking knowledge.\nI've had other faulty or missing behavior with some other Bonjour-related services like Screen Sharing, too, and I'm about to the point of just shelling out for an Airport Extreme. But before I do that, I ask you wonderful people: Is there anything I can try that doesn't require me to get a degree in networking to understand? \n\nA: If all else fails, you can always use the AirPrint Activator (an app for your Mac) that allows you to use any shared printer via AirPrint. If you can get the printer to be available over your network, you’ll still be able to use AirPrint this way.\n\nA: If you have your Wireless Access Point (WAP) configured as a router, and your AirPrint printer is connected to Ethernet, then your wireless AirPrint client and the printer are on different IP subnets. Link-local broadcast discovery protocols typically do not work through routers. That may be your problem, which can be fixed by configuring the WAP as a bridge.\n", "Q: MATLAB and Objective-C in Sublime Text 2 Is there a way to set Sublime Text 2 (running under OSX) so that it can identify MATLAB (.m) files and Objective-C (.m) files automatically? Meaning that ST2 would be able to differentiate between each one and apply it's special syntax highlighting rules. I have already seen this behavior in the all mighty VIM and Emacs.\n\nA: You may want to have a look at /Users//Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Matlab.sublime-package. It's a simple ZIP file containing a bunch of XML (Plist) files. \nIn the Sublime Doc for syntax definitions you'd be able to find a documentation of how to create (and edit) syntax definitions.\nFor an example have a look at the perl syntax definition, it contains a key named \"firstLineMatch\" which is not used in the Matlab syntax definition. But you could add one and create a file magic for/in your Matlab files.\nUpdate : I just gave it a go and it doesn't seem to work. Do be fair TextMate can't do it either.\nUpdate 2 : After some more investigation: The question about firstLineMatch came up in the Sublime Forum. The file extension is taking precedence over firstLineMatch right now. So there's not much that can be done. With firstLineMatch working you could do nice things. And this would mean that no file magic would be necessary since the syntax of Obj-C and Matlab files is different.\n\nA: In the file Matlab.tmLanguage change it to\n<key>fileTypes</key>\n<array>\n    <!-- Actually, it's generally .m, but that's taken by Objective-C. It needs an entry to show up in the syntax list. -->\n    <string>m</string>\n    <string>matlab</string>\n</array>\n\nand remove it from ObjC.tmLanguage\n", "Q: Does having Bluetooth enabled draw extra power when no devices are connected? I generally turn off Bluetooth on my Macs and iOS devices when I'm not actively using a Bluetooth device. My assumption is that this saves battery life, but I realize that I have no fact to back that up.\nDoes having Bluetooth enabled draw extra power when no paired devices are within range? What about when paired devices are in range but not connected?\nDoes turning off 'Discoverable' except when I need to pair to a device save power?\n\nA: Yes.  When the Bluetooth radio is active it not only turns on the receiver (which consumes power) but also periodically transmits to see if any known devices are in range.\nWhen paired devices are on and within range, they do communicate occasionally even if not being used, and thus consume some power.\nTurning off Discoverable will save some energy as it transmits less frequently than when it's not discoverable.\nHowever, Bluetooth is such a lower power communications standard that it's hardly worth worrying about - active Bluetooth use (headsets in particular) do use a noticeable amount of power, but almost any other use, or just leaving it on, is negligible.\nFurther, for iOS devices the Bluetooth is often part of the RF chipset, and turning it off doesn't have much impact because it shares resources with the other RF functionality of the device, and without turning the other radios off (Wifi, GPS, cellular, nike+, etc) very little actually turns off when you disable Bluetooth.\n\nA: If Bluetooth is enabled, it’s listening for connections. So yes, having it enabled will require more power than not having it enabled, even if no devices are connected.\nThe same goes for WiFi — OS X is constantly looking for new wireless networks in range unless you disable it. \n", "Q: Is the gloss on iOS icons automatically applied? Clearly it isn't completely automatic, as many icons don't have a reflection, but is there some sort of checkbox when creating an app to determine whether the gloss is applied?\n\nA: Yes, it is automatically applied by iOS. \nThere is an option for iOS application developers to turn this off, called UIPrerenderedIcon. This is a value in the Applications Info.plist, that can be turned on and off (checking it would note that this is a pre-rendered icon, and to not apply the gloss).\nYou can read more details in the iOS Human Interface Guidelines.\nWeb Applications (as noted in Mathias's answer) also do have this reflection applied to them. You can override this by naming your file apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png. More information is also provided in the HIG for web clip icons.\n\nA: jmlumpkin’s excellent answer is about native app icons. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that there’s another type of “app” that can have home screen icons.\nIt’s a different story for web apps (which can also have touch icons when added to the home screen).\nA web developer can add a touch icon to his website as follows:\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"apple-touch-icon.png\">\n\niOS then automatically adds some visual effects to your icon so that it coordinates with the built-in icons on the Home screen (as it does with application icons). Specifically, iOS adds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rounded corners\n\n*Drop shadow\n\n*Reflective shine\n\n\nAs of iOS 2.0, you can prevent the addition of these effects by using the precomposed keyword:\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" href=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\">\n\nThis is described in the Web Clip Icons section in the iOS HIG. There are some other gotchas that I documented in this write-up, but that’s the gist of it.\n", "Q: Wobbly Macbook Pro I bought a MacBook Pro yesterday, and it's \"wobbly\".  My front-right leg is about 1 mm or so shorter than my back-left leg.\nIs there a quick fix for this (I was thinking of just making it bigger by myself) or should I send it back to Apple?\n\nA: Most times I have seen this, the table is the thing not level. Does closing the lid and rotating it ninety degrees with the apple logo staying over the same spot actually move the short peg or is the table the issue?\n\nA: I suggest taking it back. I suspect that the bottom plate with the legs on it wasn't attached properly (it can flex a bit), but if it's a brand new device it's easier just to get it replaced than to try to fix it yourself.\n", "Q: Set ForkLift as default file viewer Is there a way to set ForkLift as the default file viewer, to a degree? PathFinder somehow does this, see http://cocoatech.com/faqs#3, but how does it do this and could that option be set to redirect to ForkLift instead of PathFinder?\n\nA: Now as the ForkLift V3 came out, the new command should be:\ndefaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.binarynights.ForkLift-3\n\nAt the same time, if you like to restore Finder to be the default file manager again, use:\ndefaults delete -g NSFileViewer\n\n\nA: From Forklift official documentation:\n\nIf you are using ForkLift from Setapp, paste this command instead: \ndefaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.binarynights.forklift-setapp;\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=\"public.folder\";LSHandlerRoleAll=\"com.binarynights.ForkLift-3\";}'\n\n\n\nA: Path Finder looks like it's modifying the \"NSFileViewer\" preference. You can set this manually from Terminal to point to ForkLift (I tried this, and it seems to work):\ndefaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.binarynights.ForkLift2\n\n(The -g sets this preference globally for all applications.)\nHowever, be warned that the Path Finder website lists some applications that don't respect this setting, such as the Dock and Firefox.\n\nA: You can change default file manager like this, but ForkLift or Transmit not work as expected, only Path Finder are\n#!/usr/bin/python2.6\n\nfrom LaunchServices import LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType, kLSRolesViewer, LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme\nfrom CoreFoundation import CFPreferencesCopyApplicationList, kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost, CFPreferencesSetAppValue, CFPreferencesAppSynchronize\n\napplicationBundleIdentifier = \"com.cocoatech.PathFinder\" #\"com.panic.Transmit\" #\"com.binarynights.forklift2\"\n\nLSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType(\"public.folder\", kLSRolesViewer, applicationBundleIdentifier)\nLSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(\"file:///\", applicationBundleIdentifier)\n\napplicationIDs = CFPreferencesCopyApplicationList(kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost)\nfor app_id in applicationIDs:\n    CFPreferencesSetAppValue(\"NSFileViewer\", applicationBundleIdentifier, app_id);\n    CFPreferencesAppSynchronize(app_id);\n\n", "Q: Can I use iMovie to edit a .mov file without altering the aspect ratio? I created a screencast using Snapz Pro X that gets saved in .mov format (H.264, AAC). I want to just cut a few seconds off the end of that file.

I've downloaded m4v videos (legally if you should ask*) and played them with Quicktime, VLC and MplayerX.  \nThey have the audio only in the right channel, is there a way I can equalize the output so I hear it through both channels?  \nI've tried equalizing from Audio Preferences but it obviously just decreases the volume of one channel and increases the other, but doesn't move the output from one channel to the other.\n* http://www.atheist-experience.com/videocast.php\n\nA: You can use the Universal Access preferences to play the same audio in both channels:\n\n", "Q: Can't delete folder named __MACOSX So, I have a folder in my ~./Trash folder, and I can't seem to delete it. It's named __MACOSX, and I've tried everything I can think of to get rid of it. Finder won't start at all because of it (it starts for a bit at login, but then crashes/freezes), the terminal freezes up when trying to remove it (both as me and as sudo), and it even freezes up when auto-completing (tabbing) after typing the first few characters of it. Any suggestions?\nUpdate: doing a normal ls lists it just fine, but an ls -l to try and find out more about it freezes the terminal:\npolaris:~ rob$ cd .Trash/\npolaris:.Trash rob$ ls\n__MACOSX\npolaris:.Trash rob$ ls -l\n^C^C\n\n(Pressing ^C doesn't do anything)\nAnother update: Onyx's trash utility freezes while deleting trash or secure deleting trash, SuperEmptyTrash crashes,\n\nA: I can think of a couple of things.\nFirst, try deleting everything in your .Trash folder with sudo privileges:\nsudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/*\n\nIf that fails, then try resetting the PRAM on your Mac. Sometimes doing so can surprisingly fix odd errors.\nFinally, make sure that the permissions on your .Trash folder are correct\nls -ale ~/.Trash/\n\nThe permission for the folder should be like the following:\n\ndrwx------  24 username  staff         816 Mar 24 22:06 .\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 34 username  staff        1156 Mar 24 09:51 ..\n\n\nA: First I suggested \"sudo rm -rf __MACOSX\" - that freezes the terminal.\nHmm. I only have a .Trashes in my ~, are you in 10.7?\nAnyway - \"ls -lA\" shows the trailing permission character is t, so \"only file owners can link or unlink files in the specified directory\". In this case you want to unlink (delete). The owner of this directory is root, so you need to be root.\nBy default you can't \"su\" in Lion. You can enable the root account using Directory Services, in /System/Library/CoreServices. Authenticate then choose \"Enable Root User\" in the edit menu. \nOnce that is done a plain \"su\" followed by the password makes you actually \"root\" not just another user doing things with root's permissions. The prompt will change to something very much like sh-3.2# instead of the usual, and whoami will reply \"root\".\nThen you should be able to kill that file!\n\nA: I moved the folder to /tmp and restarted my machine.  I believe /tmp isn't retained across reboots so I let the system take care of the issue.\n\nA: I tried all the suggestions above except the last one because I didn't want the machine to  fail to boot up in case it got hung trying to erase an un-erasable file.  But the following worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Moved __MACOSX out of trash by dragging it into an empty folder. \n\n*From Finder changed permissions so that owner, group, everyone could\nread/write/execute.\n\n*Opened terminal and issued sudo -r -f __MACOSX\n\n\nI was surprised that the above worked but it did!\n", "Q: iTunes or other RSS/podcast reader that can retrieve whole podcast, I.E. transversing pages? I listen to a podcast* which is in Atom RSS 2.0 format.  \nI subscribed with iTunes, the feed presents 5 entries in each page, and pages are accessible by appending ?page=n, n being the page number.  \nBut iTunes doesn't seem to see farther than the first page, is there an option for iTunes to retrieve the whole podcast instead of just the first page?  \nIs there another RSS/podcast reader that can?\n* http://venganzasdelpasado.com.ar/posts.rss\n\nA: I don’t know of an app that supports this.\nPerhaps you could add more than one feed:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://venganzasdelpasado.com.ar/posts.rss\n\n*http://venganzasdelpasado.com.ar/posts.rss?page=2\nAnd have iTunes handle it that way?\nAlternatively, you could create your own RSS feed based on the website’s HTML, rather than use the one the website is offering which is limited to 5 items. That way, you could have more entries in the feed. This can be done using FeedWeaver, a free online web app.\n", "Q: How can I charge my iPhone without waking up my MacBook Pro? I have a MacBook Pro (10.7.3) and an iPhone 4 (5.1). When I'm trying to conserve outlets, I charge my iPhone at night by plugging it directly into my computer.\nIf my computer is asleep with the lid closed, when I plug in the iPhone, the computer briefly wakes up, and it takes a few moments before it starts charging. (If the computer is already awake, the charging is instantaneous.) But my computer takes a while to go back to sleep because it saves the contents of RAM (safe sleep).\nHow can I plug the iPhone it in to charge, without waking up the computer? (And why does this happen in the first place?)\n(I've already set up my computer so that iTunes and iPhoto don't launch when I plug in my phone — but this doesn't seem to be enough.)\n\nA: It has to do with connection activity on the USB data lines in a usb cable. For example, I have a Matias Tune Blocker connected to my Mac Pro. When I have the switch set to sync my iPhone, aka its acting as a regular USB data cable for for a USB device, the Mac Pro will wake from sleep as soon as the iPhone is connected. \nHowever when I have the switch on the Tune Blocker set to charge only, eg only the USB power pins are enabled, the Mac Pro will not wake from sleep when the iPhone, etc is connected to the cable. So a solution to keep your mac a sleep when connecting your iPhone would be something like a Tune Blocker, or making a modified USB extension cable that cuts the Data wires for the device plugged into that extension cable. \n\n\nA: You can't - activity on the USB port requires the computer to wake up. If this behaviour was disabled then the times when you do something on USB and want the computer to wake up, it could not.\nOne time where this would definitely not be desired behaviour is when you plug in a USB keyboard and external monitor in order to use your closed MacBook Pro with the lid closed.\n\nA: TwelveSouth offers a product called the PlugBug to charge both devices together. \n\nPlugBug is made exclusively for all MacBook Power Adapters, including current and previous models. Snap PlugBug onto your MacBook Power Adapter and you now have the first ever device that lets you charge your MacBook + iPad or iPhone simultaneously, from one wall outlet.\n\nhttp://twelvesouth.com/products/plugbug/ Maybe is this something for you!\n\nA: You could always install Caffeine (App store)  to keep the Mac awake and make sure the screen is dimmed right down if you're away from the machine (TBH, burn-in is not much of an issue on modern LEDs). Not ideal, but will work. \n\nA: Just go to system preferences and go to display and turn on power nap. Then go to the top left apple and plug in device and click sleep on the apple menu. It should still charge but it only works with the 2012 or later models of mac or iMac or Mac air or any mac really.\n", "Q: What are the wireless display options for MacBook Air? Are there any viable Wireless display solutions for MacBook Air (with Thunderbolt port). I know I can connect to HDMI-compatible TV or Monitor using cables and convertors. Is there any way I can avoid using wires?\nFirst thing that comes to my mind is DLNA since so many TVs support DLNA. But that is just for streaming videos and not for normal laptop usage. I am curious to know any solution exists?\n\nA: You could use a Nyrius Wireless AV Sender. If you're looking for a small, slick unit to get your presentations displayed while visiting clients it probably isn't for you. If you want to get content from your Macbook Air onto your wall-mounted display at home without stringing a long HDMI cable across the room it might be just what you want.\nAn alternative - look at this youtube video showing how to do it with an intermediate iPad, maybe not so practical. It uses an app called iDisplay for $4.99. In that it seems to be doing the same kind of function as Air Display which I use and would recommend over anything else. \nSecond alternative - AirFlick from Erica Sadun - allows you to make your Mac an AirPlay source so you can mirror its display to an AppleTV, just as if it was an iPad. This won't be as easy as we might expect of Mac software, Erica is an awesome hacker but doesn't employ a team of graphic and web designers to make beautiful lick able software.\n\nA: While not available until this summer, the next version of the Mac OS (Mountain Lion) will allow you use AirPlay on some Macs to send your display to an AppleTV. \nFrom the site:\n\nYour Mac is on TV. This new feature in Mountain Lion is made for an audience. With AirPlay Mirroring, you can stream what’s on your Mac to your HDTV via Apple TV. Show web pages and videos to friends on the couch. Share lessons with a classroom. Present to a conference room. It’s a big deal for your Mac. And for everyone around it.\n\n\nA: MECast dongle will do the job and only costs around $35 online! It is much better than Chromecast for the price.\nIt supports mirroring Windows PC Laptops as well as MacBook in addition to Android phone and tablet in Miracast functions including Audio. It is also compatible with iPhone/iPad too! It supports DLNA and Airplay as well.\n\nA: I am running windows 8.1 on a macbook air 2012 and the screen mirroring is working flawlessly (1920 X1080). The TV connects as a projector under devices and you can either duplicate, extend or display on tv only. If you really want the screen mirroring function you should install windows 8.1 which supports this out of the box.\n\nA: An airplay device is not always required. We have created solutions that mirror your mac screen for a number of TV brands:\nMirror for Samsung TV: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1107644799?at=11l9Aw&mt=12\nMirror for LG TV: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1152966194?at=11l9Aw&mt=12\nA similar solution is also available for Panasonic TV's\nThese apps use DLNA to stream your screeen directly to your TV\n\nA: You can use Google Chrome to cast your mac to android tv(Or any device which supports chrome cast).\n\nA: There's an app that will allow you to cast from roku to mac.Airplay works on Roku\n", "Q: Long time Migration of macs (over 80 hours) I just changed my previous Mac (MacBook Pro dual core running Snow Leopard) to a MacBook Pro i7 with Lion, and after it is still migrating after 3 days (and according to the migration bar is about 60%, even if it indicates since it started between 60 - 80 hours. I wasn't aware of the reboot with one key (guess T) to use firewire, so it is using wifi...\nIt has been the worst nightmare I have gone through with a computer with any OS (yes, even Windows)\nThe worst thing is that the MacBookPro doesn't bring a CD/DVD so I could start the process on scratch usinqg FIREWIRE... and reinstalling the OS in case of any corruption.\nI don't know what to do, but, waiting another 3 days is going to be a big issue.\n\nA: Yeah, I have had similar experiences with WiFi transfers involving large amounts of data. The good news is that if you are extremely patient it will probably work out OK. The other good news is that if you have not messed with the factory partitioning scheme it doesn't matter that you can't install from CD/DVD. \nIf you do choose to restart the whole process - by resetting your new machine to original configuration with the Lion Recovery Partition - then a Migration using Target Disk Mode and the right FireWire 800 cable will probably take only an hour or so to complete.\n", "Q: After restoring my iPhone from iCloud, my photos are all low resolution. How can I fix this? I restored my iPhone 4S from iCloud after recieving a replacement one from the Apple store. It took many hours for The applications and photos to come back but once restored, all of the photos on the iPhone are now low resolution.\nHow can I restore the photos, which were backed up to iCloud, back to my iPhone in their original resolution?\n\nA: According to this site it is a limitation of iCloud. You can, however, download the full-resolution images from iCloud to your computer. So you haven't lost the high-res versions, you just have to pull them over through local syncing and not iCloud.\n", "Q: Xcode 4.2 Snow Leopard Doesn't Install My mac crashed and I am trying to install Xcode 4.2 again, but it doesn't work.\nThe GUI shows an 'The Installation Failed' error.\nIn the console a few messages stick out to me.

I had this error when Xcode 4 was first released.\nFirst of all, have you tried rebooting? That solved the problem for me.\nAlso, in case rebooting doesn't work, just redownload the SDK. It might have gotten corrupted during download.\n", "Q: stop iTunes from auto-playing after import I drag a movie onto the iTunes icon. iTunes imports the movie, and then begins playing it for me automatically.\nHow do I stop it from playing the movie automatically?\n\nA: according to this macworld article, do the following in Terminal, quit & relaunch iTunes\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunes play-songs-while-importing -bool FALSE\n\n\nA: Use cmd+O inside iTunes instead of drag and drop, at least that worked for me!\n\nA: There is a thread here on the Apple Support forums that mentions your problem.  Here's what you can try:\n\nThe most consistent way I've found to solve this is to drop your files\n  into the \"Automatically add to iTunes folder.\"   How I do it on a Mac:\n  Navigate to Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/ Seconday click on\n  \"Automatically Add to iTunes\" Select \"create alias.\" - this makes a\n  shortcut, for those who didn't know Click and drag the new shortcut\n  you just made to your desktop or launchbar or somewhere else where it\n  is more convenient for you. Drag any new files that you want to add to\n  iTunes onto that from now on, if you don't want them to autoplay.\n\nAnother user suggests that you can use the shortcut of ⌘-O, or just use the open dialog to open your media.\n\nA: Another way is to drag the movie or song to their respective folders in your library, and then use the file - import method in itunes to add it to your library without having it play when it's done importing. \n", "Q: iCloud access through browser My iphone takes photos, automatically uploads them to the cloud in a cool way and then they arrive on my iPhoto without me having to do anything - that's excellent but is it also possible for me to view the photos online through a browser or similar? Apologies if this is a particularly easy question - my google-fu is failing me today...\n\nA: Modern Answer (2016):\nThis is a feature of iCloud Photo Library, that launched in 2015 (and was in beta in 2014). With the updates to Photo Stream/iCloud Photo Library, your photo library is now viewable on iCloud.com.  \nOriginal Answer (2012):\nThis feature is called Photo Stream, and at this point, there is no web version of it. \nThe previous iteration of iCloud, which was called Mobile Me, did have a gallery option, but did not have the direct upload integration like Photo Stream (you had to manually post images).\n\nA: iPhoto for iOS (but so far not Mac) can create galleries (called Journals) on iCloud which you can then share. Although you have to do this manually, and it doesn't operate on the photo stream automatically so this doesn't do exactly what you're asking about. But I mention it because you might find it helpful.\n", "Q: MacBook Air has delay when waking from sleep I have a MacBook Air (11-inch, Late 2010). \nEver since I purchased it, I have noticed that it has quite a delay waking from sleep. It takes sometimes up to 5-10 seconds to fully wake up and allow me to do anything. \nWhat is causing this, and is there any way to prevent it?\n\nA: Airs do go into standby mode more readily than other macs. \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (Late 2010) and later: About standby mode\nAssuming its not just the extra time to exit standby mode (and isn't really sleeping anymore), have you checked the startup disk preference as the article above recommends?\nYou may have to look in the console log for sleep / standby messages in case your mac is entering standby / hibernate earlier than the expected one hour. The pmset command can show you the details of your Air's power management settings. Here's what a Mid 2011 Air looks like with mostly default settings:\nmac:~ me$ pmset -g\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1\nAC Power        -1*\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelay   4200\n standby    1\n womp       1\n halfdim    1\n panicrestart   157680000\n hibernatefile  /var/vm/sleepimage\n networkoversleep   0\n disksleep  10\n sleep      10\n hibernatemode  3\n ttyskeepawake  1\n displaysleep   10\n acwake     0\n lidwake    1\n\nYou can also use pmset to change either the number of seconds before standby kicks in, which is standbydelay; or turn standby off completely by setting standby to 0. Use the command man pmset for details.\n\nA: I'm starting to think this might have to do with WiFi. I've done all the SMC reset stuff. But a second problem was that the MBA 11\" was also not automatically connecting to known WiFi networks upon wakeup. It seems if you address that problem the wakeup gets quicker (yet not as immediate as one may still wish). What you do to solve the WiFi problem is to make a new Location in your Network settings.\n\nA: One way to start to figure it out is to create a new user (System Preferences/users and groups), log out of your user account and into the new user account, then restart the computer.\nNow close the lid, wait a bit, and open the lid. Did it wake up faster? If so, there's something in your user account that's running causing it. The next step would be to log back into your user account and go back to system preferences/users and groups and see if you have things that are running in the background.\n\nA: Something like this happens if it did a hibernation (saved the memory on disk). This happens when it runs out of battery so if this always happens I expect you have problems with the battery.\n", "Q: iTunesConnect iOS app on iPad? The iTunes connect site has a link for the native app, when you browse from an iOS app. On iPhone the download link works fine, however on iPad it opens the iTunes app (rather than the app store) and doesn't seem to ever load anything?\nDoes the app exist for iPad (or if you can install it, does it only work in 2x mode)? And is there another way to to get to the app page?\n\nA: I have the same issue on my iPad, and if you search the store, it seems to be hidden. If I search the store on my Mac in iTunes, it shows up though.  \nThe direct link to it is http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/itunes-connect-mobile/id376771144?mt=8\n\nIt also is a universal app, so it has an interface designed for the iPad. \nClicking this link on my iPad though still doesn't take me to the actual app. I think this may be a bug in the App Store. I can see it in iTunes on my computer and add it to my iPad that way.\nAfter syncing it to my iPad through my computer, it launches fine, will connect, and looks good. The copyright on the app is 2010 though, so it looks like it hasn't been updated in a while (for example, no retina graphics on iPad). I did have a few times it threw an error saying it couldn't connect. I also don't have any apps in thee right now to test.\n", "Q: How secure are iCloud backups? Are iCloud backups encrypted, both when transmitted and stored?\nIs it possible for someone at Apple to access any backup made to the data enter?\nI have heard that when apps have been pulled from the app store they have also been removed iCloud backups, so if they can be modified by apple then surely they aren't stored securely?\nI have a lot of my passwords for websites and apps saved, so I assume these are stored in the backups as well?\n\nA: ArsTechnica just wrote a great piece on this. \nA quick outtake:\n\nThe simple answer is that your data is at least as safe as it is when stored on any remote server, if not more so. All data is transferred to computers and mobile devices using secure sockets layer via WebDAV, IMAP, or HTTP. All data except e-mail and notes—more on that later—are stored and encrypted on disk on Apple's servers. And secure authentication tokens are created on mobile devices to retrieve information without constantly transmitting a password.\n\nAnd backups are stored and transferred encrypted. As for an employee being able to access a backup, only an Apple employee would be able to correctly answer that. \nIf an App was pulled from the store, they may not need to actually go into your backup to remove it. All apps have a unique identifier, and if anything they can just delete that backup for everyone (think of the backups being stored individually rather than a big ZIP file if you will). Again, this is internal to Apple so no one can fully answer that part. \nFinally, backups do include the Keychain, but this is also encrypted and the key is tied to the device that did the backup. \nFrom various places I have read online, Apple meets or exceeds (more often the case) standard security procedures in this regard.\n\nA: Documentation does exist covering this topic. Note:\n\niCloud Security\n  iCloud secures your content by encrypting it when sent over the Internet, storing it in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for authentication.  \n\nYou can find more at:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4865\nYou probably should not send your passwords to a cloud server, though. In any case this is a poor choice as far as your security and information are concerned. \n\nA: The good news.  Data is encrypted using SSL while it is transferred between your computer and the iCloud servers.  Also, data is encrypted while it is \"at rest\", stored on the iCloud servers (with some exceptions; see below).  Encryption is invisible, easy to use, and automatic (on by default).\nThe less-good news. iCloud uses server-side encryption, not client-side encryption.  When sending data to the cloud, it gets encrypted on your machine with SSL, then decrypted at the iCloud servers, then re-encrypted using an encryption key that Apple knows for storage.  This means that Apple employees have the technical ability to read your data.  There may be procedural, technical, or policy controls to make this unlikely, but the capability is there.  That means that if Apple's cloud ever gets compromised by a sophisticated attacker, the attacker could potentially access all your data.  In other words, any data breach or accident on Apple's part could potentially expose your data.  This may not be too likely, but given that even respected companies like Google have been breached, a breach or other exposure of the iCloud servers is not unthinkable.\nEmail and notes are not stored in encrypted form, while on Apple's servers.  Email often contains sensitive information -- e.g., account passwords, reset links -- so this is a bit dangerous.\nIf law enforcement asks Apple for a copy of your data, Apple will share it with them.  Apple won't necessarily require a warrant.  EFF gives Apple only one out of four stars for protecting user data in its report, When Government Comes Knocking, Who Has Your Back?, and dings Apple for not being transparent about government requests for access to your data and not telling users when their data has been disclosed to the government.\nThe risks are not limited to government requests.  If you get sued, or end up in a contentious divorce, the opposing party's lawyers could subpoena your data from Apple, and Apple would be required to disclose it to them.  Note that the threshold for a subpoena is relatively low: primarily, that the data has a likelihood of being relevant to the case.\nThe security of your data on iCloud is only as good as the passphrase on your Apple ID.  Therefore, if you want your data to be secure, you need to choose a long and strong passphrase.  Unfortunately, there are some aspects of the current systems that tend to nudge users towards choosing short, weak passphrases.  The OS refuses to store this passphrase in the keychain, requiring you to type it in frequently.  If you use an iOS device, you will frequently need to type in your Apple ID passphrase (e.g., every time you install or update an app).  Because entering a long and strong passphrase is a major pain on an iPhone, many users may end up choosing a short, poor passphrase just for convenience sake -- which unfortunately leaves their iCloud data poorly secured.  So, the current design may tend to encourage many users to use a weak password, leaving their data at risk.\nFurther reading. The Economist has an excellent argument summarizing the security implications of storing your data on the cloud, and the different levels of security afforded by different providers; for comparison, iCloud is similar to DropBox in its security properties, and weaker than SpiderOak.  To help understand why Apple might have chosen the particular architecture it did, you might enjoy Ben Adida's blog article: Encryption is not gravy; it has significant implications for usability..\nSummary. iCloud's security practices are largely in line with mainstream practice in this area.  iCloud appears to have a reasonable and professionally designed security architecture.  While there are some security risks, for most people, iCloud's security is likely to be good enough, and the convenience benefits of iCloud will likely outweigh any risks for most folks.\nHowever, storing your data in the cloud does increase the risk.  For some particularly-sensitive users -- e.g., health records, financial institutions, or other companies with sensitive data -- it might be prudent to avoid storing the most sensitive data in the cloud.\n", "Q: Any difference from Apple instructions when installing Bootcamp to dual-drive iMacs? Apple's Bootcamp instructions make no mention of how to proceed with a dual-drive iMac. Are there any differences in formatting/installation procedures involving either or both of the drives? I am new to Macs and don't want to muck up what is working well. \n\nA: If you have an internal SSD and HDD I think it comes down to which one is the boot drive. You can choose the startup disk in the Preferences pane.\nYou can change the startup disk by formatting the new drive with GUID in Disk Utility.\nI think the Bootcamp partition must be on the same drive as the startup disk, so that it shows up when you press Alt during boot.\nIf you use an external SSD drive, Bootcamp can not start the installation on an external drive (eg. external Thunderbolt enclosure with SSD), however you can install on the internal drive and clone the partition.\nBootCamp installation on a secondary internal drives may require cloning a partition, see this post.\n", "Q: iPad photo editing app that exports edits as XMP to reuse in lightroom? Basically, I'm looking for Lightroom for iPad :) but until then, I'm trying to find an alternative.  \nTo organize and tag pictures I'll be using Photosmith which integrates with Lightroom. \nNow, I need an app to do basic editing of pictures (cropping, exposure, saturation). But I need an app will do this in a non-destructive way and that will make the edits available as XMP so that later, I can just copy the XMP as sidecar files and load them in Lightroom (or better, it could load them via a lightroom plug-in the same way Photosmith works).\nPS: I posted the same question on photo.stackexchange.com, see here.\n\nA: Have you tried Adobe Revel?\nBasically you can edit photos on your iPad, store them on your computer and the edit them there as well.\nIt's a subscription service with many of the features of Lightroom.\n", "Q: iPhoto not recognizing memory card, but mounts in Finder I am running Lion with most recent version of iPhoto.\nI can access the memory card in Finder without problem, but when I launch iPhoto the card does not show up to import photos it contains. I have tried rebuilding my entire iPhoto database and settings by pressing option+command while the app is in the process of starting and selecting to rebuild. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Connect the memory card and launch the program Image Capture (found in the Utilities folder in both /Applications/ or in Launchpad, if you're running Lion. In the lower left corner of the screen, there should be a menu that says Connecting this camera opens...; from the menu, select iPhoto from the list.\nThis should make iPhoto launch when you connect this memory card.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem where my camera stopped appearing in iPhoto. It turned out that the problem was the camera contained too many photos (more than 1000) and I was just being impatient. When I waited for 4-5 minutes it finally appeared. Usually I don't have so many photos on the camera and I was used to it appeared in iphoto within a few seconds of being plugged in.\n\nA: Open iPhoto, and then drag the SD card symbol that is on your desktop, into a folder in iPhoto (you can create a folder and name it whatever you want). Then iPhoto will import all the contents of that SD card!\n\nA: this answer is from 2017.  I only had videos on my SD card.  My Sd card would mount to the finder but not auto mount like usual in Photos.  My solution was to put the SD card in my camera, take one picture.  I inserted my SD card back in my iMac and Photos auto mounted the SD card like usual.  Hope this helps!\n", "Q: CD digital audio ripping tool for OS X that has accurate extraction, error detection, and verbose reporting? I'm almost ready to say I have found a good OS X replacement for every piece of software I use on Windows (excluding some Windows development tools), but there's still this gap to fill:\nFor CD digital audio ripping / extraction, I use a tool on Windows called EAC - Exact Audio Copy.  I like EAC because:\n\n\n*\n\n*it supports a very reliable extraction mode by default,\n\n*it takes advantage of drive features like C2 error correction\n(and will tell you if your CD-ROM drive doesn't have it)\n\n*it validates tracks were ripped accurately by consulting an online database, and\n\n*it reports verbose details about potential issues, when they arise, and I can then listen to the track to see if the issues are perceptible or not.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, I can be confident whether a track was reliably ripped or not when using EAC.\nI don't get this sense of confidence from iTunes.  iTunes has an option under Import Settings to Use error correction when reading Audio CDs, but that seems to be the extent of reliability-oriented settings in iTunes. Currently, I'll use iTunes if the disc I'm ripping appears pristine and without scratches – otherwise I turn to EAC.\nIs there an application for OS X that, like EAC above, focuses on reliable CD digital audio extraction and provides detailed information?  Thank you.\n\nA: XLD\nIt started out as decoder/encoder/transcoder tool but it's branched out in to ripping in recent years (version 20080812 and above have ripping features) and it supports most of your criteria:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uses the AccurateRip technology, comparing MD5 sums against known-good library of rips to ensure the rip was done correctly.\n\n*Uses cdparanoia 10.2 as the ripping and error correction library. Can be used on drives that don't have Accurate Stream and utilize C2 error pointers.\n\n\n(Source for above)\nI can't comment on the \"verbose details when errors arise\" request because I've never encountered an error ripping with it.\nIt's free. It will multi-thread to speed up encoding of albums. And it's pretty fast. It's been my encoder/transcoder of choice for years now.\n", "Q: Reinstall Mac OS X Lion and do selective restore from Time Machine backup My MacBook Pro is so slow that it would put a Windows XP laptop to shame, so I am considering a fresh installation of Mac OS. I have Time Machine backups of the system, but I don't want to restore system files, preferences, applications, etc., because it would probably reimport stuff that was slowing down the system in the first place.\nWhat's the best way to go about this? I am currently downloading the OS from the Mac App Store. I know how to start off the installation from an external drive. But then what? I just want my documents and iPhoto library.\nAnyone with any experience with this?\nAm I right in assuming that since I have a current Time Machine backup, in the worst case I can go back and find any missing files if I do a clean install?\n\nA: As I answered in this recent question your Time Machine drive will also appear as a valid Migration Assistant source if you opt for wipe and reinstall - I was surprised. When you use Migration Assistant you do get some control over what you install and what you leave behind.\n\nA: Different people will recommend different strategies, but here's what I'd recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a clean install of the OS. Get everything installed and set up the way you want it.\n\n*Import your documents and iPhoto library from a Time Machine backup.\n\n*Copy the latest backup of your pre-reinstall computer to another drive as a back up backup.\n\n*Delete the rest of the old backups and set up Time Machine again.\n\n\nA: If not sure it's 100% necessary but you might want to deauthorize your existing install of iTunes before doing the clean install.\n", "Q: Slow connection to my particular brand of router over WiFi with Lion on MacBook Pro I own a MacBook Pro for some months now, it came with OS X Lion pre-installed. Since then, surfing the net with it is painful due to slowness. I also have a MacBook with Snow Leopard on it, there the internet works at normal speed. Based on this I conclude the problem is inside the MacBook Pro - it shows full WLAN connectivity but loading Google takes forever. My Router is a AVM Fritz!Box.\nWhat I tried so far to optimize the speed - unless (noted) the changes made below don't affect the measured latency or speed at which pages render:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting the router, turning WLAN on and off\n\n*Switching WLAN channels, trying 802.11n+a and 802.11n+g \n\n*Deleting all Wi-Fi networks in the system preferences\n\n*Resetting PRAM and NVRAM\n\n*Re-starting the MacBook Pro multiple times in a row\n\n*Disable iCloud in system preferences\n\n*Using another Browser than Safari\n\n*Renaming the network\n\n*Disableing \"Use channels optimized for 300 Mbit/s\" in my router (this helped, but still not to equal the speed of Snow Leopard)\n\n\nWhat else could I try? I read changing the DNS server Google's can help, bit to  my understanding, this really can't fix the problem. Reinstalling is not an option. I am really desperate to solve this problem because it is more than annoying!\n\nA: Have you tried flushing the DNS cache? In Terminal.app, enter dscacheutil -flushcache.\n\nIt could be your DHCP router handing out IPv6 information incorrectly, which is especially annoying if you don’t need IPv6 — like at home. This seems like the most logical explanation, given that all browsers and applications are suffering from the speed issues.\nGo to System Preferences → Network → WiFi → Advanced → TCP/IP and set “Configure IPv6” to “Link-local only”.\n\n\nA: Since this issue has been outstanding for months and you have done a very good job of ruling out the easy sources of slowness, you are now faced with digging in and doing some measurements as well as spending more time isolating the issue.\nThese things are very helpful for next steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*isolating the OS as installed\n\n*taking the Macs to a different router and re-testing\n\n*reinstalling the OS (I know you said it's not an option, but it is for many and may be the cure you need if you have a driver problem or other corruption on the OS install)\n\n\nBefore you do anything, you will want to get accurate timing of three web sites that you care to optimize for. Since you say everything is slow and it's taking forever, you could use a stopwatch to time things. I prefer using the web inspector in Safari to get millisecond accurate timing of the elements that make up a page load.\n\nYou get to this by the settings, advanced tab and enabling the checkbox that places the Develop menu in the menu bar. Here (above) you can see a reasonably fast wireless network with a fairly good broadband connection to the internet. Below you can see the same page when loaded over 100 MB ethernet - significantly faster load time and less latency.\n\nOnce you have a feeling for what slow actually measures to be, you can know if it's a latency or routing or bandwidth issue.\nNow you can change one thing at a time (the OS, the router, whatever) and re-measure to see if you have made things better.\nI would install Lion cleanly onto an external drive and test that. It's possible your router and Mac just don't work together well, but I would expect you could tune things well enough with these tools to resolve the issue. Once you have the details of a page load, you'll know if the same content is begin drawn to both OS and where to look for improvements. Don't neglect free RAM as well - if your Mac can't cache items well due to space issues, you could simply be re-downloading things from the internet on the \"slow\" machine.\nGood luck hunting.\n\nA: One tip I found on the German Apple Support Community actually solved my problem: I disabled WiFi 802.11n, so went with 802.11bg. Since then, my speed is comparable to Ethernet again. I am suggesting this because you do not seem to have tried that. WiFi 802.11n is the fastest WiFi standard, so it hurts to switch it off. But WiFi b+g is faster than my internet anyway.\n(After posting my initial answer sometimes the WiFi was fast, sometimes slow, sometimes unusable, sites would wait to load forever. That is the reason why I voted to delete my initial answer, because it did not actually solve my problem.)\n", "Q: Apple lossless through iTunes Match to iPhone? I have some songs that are encoded in Apple Lossless on my MacBook Air. They are in iTunes Matched. \nWhen I add the songs I get 256 kbps. I cannot add via iTunes because I have Match enabled.  If I turn off Match, my songs get wiped from the iPhone.  \nHow can I get my Apple Lossless songs to coexist with my Match library without wiping them every time I switch?\n\nA: You could use a different media player app that does not use the iPhone music library but uses it's on memory. Then you can upload your lossless music files to that app and play it. Something like AnyPlayer might be suitable.\nOr, if you have a dropbox account, you might find songbox helpful.\n\nA: One workarond would be to change the media type for those files from music to podcast or video.  Match would ignore them in the future. \n\nA: To get lossless on two computers when  using match you just need:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect to the shared iTunes on the second computer\n\n*make sure that you don't have local copies of the tracks (little cloud icon by the name)\n\n*import tracks that are lossless.\n\n\nIt looks like you will create a second version of each track, but in fact ultimately iTunes sorts itself out and keeps only the lossless version\nI haven't tried with a  physical 256 copy of a track already downloaded to the library, only when the track is listed but showing as iCloud only\n", "Q: App Store opens unDock Lite product page seemingly randomly I recently installed unDock Lite from the Mac App Store but was not satisfied with its functionality and uninstalled it the same day.\nBut from time to time the App Store opens the unDock Lite product page.\nIs this some very rude advertising from the unDock Lite creators, or could there be a shortcut registered for example, and OS X takes me to the product page associated with it, if it's not currently installed?\n\nA: Is there any mention of the app or the page in ~/Library/Cookies/com.apple.appstore.plist? At least one other AskDifferent user had trouble with this file and solved the problem by deleting it - maybe that should be the last resort though.\nYou can also enable \"debug mode\" in the Mac App Store by doing defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -boolean YES - when you have done that you will see a new menu:\n\nI would try Clear Cookies first, and if that doesn't help, Reset Application.\n\nA: While the other tips might be useful for some people experiencing similar issues, I have found the reason for this weird behavior.\nI had a tab open in Firefox, and every time I restarted Firefox, it opened the shop. I didn't immediately drew a connection between the two, since I have many open tabs, and the timing seemed coincidental, as it took maybe two or three minutes after launching Firefox for the App Store to pop up. \n", "Q: Ability to set even below the minimum brightness on iPad In the night the lowest brightness setting on iPad (1st gen) is still too bright.\nIs it possible to set it even lower somehow?\nOn iBooks it's possible but it works only on iBooks itself and not on whole iPad.\nrunning the latest iOS 5.1\n\nA: Many people use the black on white mode to invert the color mapping for applications that will not specify more of the LCD to be grey or black and less of it white. Some blog articles call this \"night mode\" but it's a typical adjustment for people that have different visual abilities.\nSettings App -> General –> Accessibility –> Triple-click Home -> “Toggle White on Black.”\nEven though you can't reduce the illumination of the lights in the iPad further without a jailbreak, you can use this system setting to increase the amount of light that gets blocked in many cases by triple clicking the home button.\nAlso, many apps are being programmed to only draw in night mode where only red pixels are used. This also cuts down on the transmission of colors that our eyes use to constrict pupils and preserve night vision. This isn't a general solution, but for apps like Star Walk - this works very well in practice.\n\n\nA: Depending on just how much you want the brightness lowered, you might consider applying a screen protector to the iPad. Reviews of the Splash Masque Screen Protector in particular mention that the display seems slightly darker when the protector is applied. The reviews take this as a negative, but if that's the effect you're looking for, you could exploit this side effect for your advantage.\nIn the absence of a non-jailbreak software solution, a hardware solution might be your best bet.\n\nA: On a jailbroken iPad, you can use SBSettings to lower the brightness even further than the arbitrary lower limit that iOS normally allows.\nWithout jailbreaking, you can lower the brightness beyond the settings limit only in the iBooks app (as you mentioned), not system-wide.\n\nA: The ipad generation 1 has an LED backlit LCD, so if the hardware supported it, it could go lower (if it were CCFL it would have a limit before it turned off completely).\nHowever, the backlight hardware simply doesn't let it go lower - similar to the iPhone 3GS.  Remember that when they came out you could only change the brightness in Settings, and Apple didn't provide nor see a need to dim them further until the iPad became the success it was, and people complained that the minimum brightness was too high.\niBooks includes a workaround specifically because people complained about brightness issues when reading in the dark.  Once you try to go below the minimum supported backlight brightness, ibooks starts to decrease the brightness of the screen simply by using darker colors.  You can see this by setting iBooks very low on a gen one ipad, then taking a screen shot, then setting it very high and taking a screenshot.  The actual image is darker.\nI haven't played with SBSettings to find out if it actually causes the backlight hardware to lower the brightness (which, despite the hardware not supporting it, is still possible if you get the CPU to PWM dim the backlight itself - but it costs you CPU cycles) or if it modifies the video driver to reduce the color space so that all apps appear dimmer.\n\nA: To lower brightness lower than the limit:\n\nSettings app > General > Accessibility > Zoom:\nSet Zoom Region > \"Full Screen Zoom\"\nSet Zoom Filter > \"Low Light\"\nSet Maximum Zoom Level all the way to the right (The highest value)\n\nGo back to Accessibility:\n\nSettings app > General > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut:\nSet \"Triple-Click The Home Button For\" > Zoom\n\nTo Test: Triple click the home button and the screen will go darker.\n\nA: There's no way to do that because the video driver has established limits in his firmware. \n\nA: Use a cooling glass while using iPad at night.\n\nA: Try \"Night web browser by Alex\". Only a web browser but you can dim the screen as much as you like. \n", "Q: iPhoto Lost Faces I just noticed that my iPhoto lost all of the \"Faces\" data (reason unknown).  It must have happened fairly recently.  I sync the entire library with my iPad, and the faces are still on the iPad.  And I definitely have Time Machine backups of the library on the computer (though I don't want to just restore to an earlier state because I've added photos since).\nHow would you guys recommend I go about restoring this data?  If I have to, I can restore an earlier version of the whole library and open the library data file (it's just XML, right?) and manually copy data to the current file.  I'm just curious what people here would recommend, if you're more familiar with the library format and all.\n\nA: Try giving this a shot.  Find your iPhoto library in your Pictures folder (unless you've moved it).\nRight click on it, and hit Show Package Contents.  In the resulting folder, look for two files named face_blob.db and face.db.  These are the two files that probably got corrupted in your case.\nNow, I'd browse your Time Machine backups and look for the last date when you had faces.  Copy those two files from the past, and replace the current files (make a backup of those just in case).\nThat should do the trick.\n\nA: The same thing happened to me, thousands and thousands of face-tagged photos in iPhoto completely lost that info after the latest OSX update (May 11).\nLuckily I had Time Machine backups from before that - the files/folders that need recovering are:\nFaces.db (in Pictures/iPhoto Library/Database/apdb)\n\nFaces folder (in Pictures/iPhoto Library/Database)\n\nNotably in the latter folder, I noticed that the folder FaceNames had almost zero entries in the current copy but older versions had a few hundred (corresponding with around the number of faces I would have guessed I tagged). I recovered from the most recent copy that had the most entries.\nUpon restart, all Face tagging was back!\n", "Q: Google Mail doesn't download label as folder I use GMail for push mail on my iPhone. I need that feature to sync my contact, calendar and email with Google. Setup is done using Microsoft Exchange following official tutorial from google at http://support.google.com/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&topic=14252&answer=138740\nThe problem is, it seems the push mail downloads all of my labels on GMail, which is 200 labels, and it annoys me. (Screenshot below)\n\nIs there any solution to remove that Label/Folder?\n\nA: You can disable these from your Gmail Preferences.\nGo to Settings > Labels, and uncheck all the labels you don't wish to appear on your iPhone.  Once done, the iPhone should update accordingly.  If not, just delete the account and add it again.\nFor example, here are my settings:\n\n\nA: You might want to consider using imap instead of MS exchange. It's quite possible to sync your contacts with Gmail. To do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*connect your phone to itunes and select the \"info\" tab\n\n*Enable the \"Sync Contacts\" option.\n\n*Enable Sync Google Contacts and enter your google details.\n\n\nNow you can change your gmail to imap as per the settings in sudo rm's answer.\n", "Q: How to hide video on an iPad? So Walking Dead season 1 was a welcomed recent gift, it isn't The Sopranos but it's not bad. But it's pretty graphic. With a couple of hundred hours of Left 4 Dead 2 I don't mind but I don't think it is suitable for children.\nIs there a means to hide either selected video, or ideally, all episodes of a show in iTunes?\nFailing that are there third party apps to achieve this that are still good for playing and watching video? I'm thinking along the lines of Comic Zeal which does a great job for comics - drag and drop iTunes syncing, great organization tools etc. The difference would be that if older son switches away from the game I said he could play to my app, without an extra password the videos would either be unplayable or just not appear at all.\nDisabling iTunes isn't an option because sometimes I'll want to hand over the iPad so he can watch a video that is OK. So global Parental Controls options won't really work.\n\nA: I feel that this is absolutely third-party app territory. One that fills your needs well would be OPlayer HD (not a Universal Binary, iPad specific), chiefly due to it's capability to password protect content, with a few very notable caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the 'safe for everyone' videos in iTunes, sync it and use the Videos player for those.\n\n*Use OPlayer's sync mechanisms (iTunes Document Sync, WiFi Transfer, etc.) for getting the restricted videos into the app, and then password protect it. \nFirst, note that OPlayer does not support a simple pin/passcode, instead you have a full keyboard to type out a password. (You can always make your password a simple pin, I'm just stating that the input interface uses the full keyboard and not a \"ten key\" digit mode.)\nSecond, note that OPlayer's password protects the WHOLE app. Not just specific videos. This is why I suggest you split up the videos between the built-in player/iTunes housed videos, and OPlayer specifically.\nLastly, and perhaps most annoyingly, if you are done using OPlayer you should absolutely double-tap the home button and manually close OPlayer when you're done with it. If the app is running at all, even \"suspended\", you will NOT be re-prompted for the password when you return to the app.\n", "Q: How do I use piano pedals in Garageband? I created a new piano project in Garageband. When I click the on-screen keyboard, it plays notes. On a normal piano, one of the pedals causes notes to continue playing even after they are released (I believe they eventually begin to slowly fade away). How can I get this same effect in Garageband?\n\nA: The ⇥ Tab key functions as the sustain pedal in the on-screen keyboard, if you switch to the Musical Typing mode:\n\nIf you must use the Keyboard mode, you can insert pedaling after the fact in the Score editor:\n\n", "Q: Can I delete an iOS game and retain my progress? I want to delete a game from my iPhone in order to make room for other apps. If I try to do so, it warns that all of the app's data will be deleted.\nThis is a game which has stages that you need to unlock in order to play them again. If I ever reinstall this game, I don't want to have to go through the entire process of unlocking stages. I want to be able to retain my progress and start from there. Is there any way to delete the game from my iPhone but have it remember my progress in case I reinstall it later?\nI know that Game Center stores information about high scores and badges, but does it also save my progress?\n\nA: Some developers will help you out by telling you just which files you need to copy from the bundle to keep your progress - it's worth an email. Mika Mobile is one of these - see how I was able to copy my Battleheart progress from one device to another here. If you are comfortable copying a file it's not hard.\nIf you delete an app then the app's bundle (and the app) will still be backed up as part of the iTunes backup if you have made one.\nYou could archive the backup, found in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/.\nThat's a really chunky approach though. It is going to restore everything, so you are going to overwrite any progress you have made in other apps since that backup.\nMy approach would be to use iExplorer to copy the Documents and Libraries directories from the app, and put them back later. To be sure that this is going to work you would need to backup, archive the backup, then copy docs & library directories for the app. Then delete the app. Reinstall the app, put the docs and libraries directories back. If your app retains progress like you want then you are free to proceed. If not, restore from the backup and keep thinking... maybe pick some other app to remove?\n\nA: Game Center does not currently have any mechanism for saving game progress.\nFor games which store progress information on your device, that information will be deleted when you delete the app. However, it will be backed up in iTunes, so you can restore this from a backup (see this question for more information).\nGames which choose to save progress in iCloud may do so — in which case, if it's properly implemented, simply reinstalling the app will give it access to the old data (assuming you're logged into the same iCloud account).\n\nA: When you delete an app, it no longer gives you an option about saving your data. You can't choose keep or remove anymore. \n\nA: I'd like to comment on the answers here, since they both state that deleting an app will remove all data.\nHowever, Supercell (creators of Clash of Clans) have apparently found a solution to this problem. Although all game data is stored on their servers, it does save account information somewhere on your phone, which will remain even after the app has been uninstalled.\nFirst: No, this is not the Game Center Account which recovers the data, because even when I log of GC, uninstall the app, reinstall the app and start the game, it will go back to where I was before.\nSecond: I have been hearing about using UDID to define that it is the same device, but this is not true either. Since March 2012 (I think) Apple no longer allows applications/games to access the UDID of the device (for privacy reasons).\nI guess it is possible that (probably a very limited amount of) data is stored outside of the app-bundle, although I am not sure how and where. \n\nA: I too have an apple device, After one of the recent updates, I have not been able to save data it says \"Deleting this app will delete its data\" In the past you pressed delete, and it asked you if you will remove the apps data. But now, You have no option. It just deletes it with its data. \nI tested this out on my app, redownloaded it, and opened it, and my data was gone. \nI did it because I have the same problem I don't want to lose my Minecraft worlds, so I tested out iCloud, it wont work, so don't risk it. Game Center only saves achievements. Not data or progress.\n\nA: Some games ask for you facebook account and they use it to save the player progress. For example Tap Titans, Real Racing, Candy Crush...etc. check that out. \n", "Q: Apple iPhone 4 flash memory I read that flash memory has a certain amount of read and write operations which can render it unusable after it has exceeded the threshhold.\nIs this something to be concerned about with regards to the Flash memory used in my iPhone, or is there a way to mitigate any ill effects of using it too much?\n\nA: From the Wikipedia-page:\n\nMost flash devices are designed for about 100,000 - 1,000,000 write\n  operations (or \"write cycles\").\n\nAs you can read, the typical NAND flash has 100k+ write cycles, so I won't worry about that. Besides, I'm sure Apple has figured out some kind of system to increase this number by making iOS \"drive-smart\", meaning they've optimized the way iOS is reading/writing data to the flash in order to extend his life-cycle.\nLike XAleXOwnZX said in his comment, the NAND flash memory will survive most iPhone life spans.\nAnd another fact, it will take you about 140 years to wear out the same flash location. Most of the time, the data stays in the cache rather then it will be written on the flash memory.  \nI hope this answer comforts your concerns :)\nEDIT: I've found what kind of flash is used in an iPhone 4. It's Samsung K9PFG08 flash memory and this blogpost tells you more about the typical reading and writing data and kind of confirms my findings above.\n", "Q: How to clean off keyboard marks on screen? On the screen on my MacBook Air, there are some little square marks from the keyboard.\nAre they permanent, or can I clean them off? How can I prevent this from happening in the first place?\n\nA: The MacBook Air keyboard shouldn't be touching the screen when it's normally closed.  This only happens when you've put the computer under pressure when it's closed.  For example, maybe you put it in a backpack with heavy books surrounding it and putting pressure on it.\nAbout whether they're permanent, it depends on how \"etched\" they are.  If you try a moist, soft cloth and rub the screen gently for about a minute, and they don't come off, then unfortunately they most likely will not ever come off.  If you're still under AppleCare, they might fix this for you.\nYou can prevent this from happening in the future by putting a very thin cloth between the keyboard and the screen when you sleep it.  Also, try not to put pressure on the computer, then it won't happen in the first place.\n\nA: If you are very lucky it is just dirt and can be wiped off but usually it is permanent and there isn't much way to avoid them. I have seen it happen even when a soft cloth is used to cover the keys when the lid is closed. In fact that may even make it worse as the cloth adds thickness to the sandwich and may make the contact between the high points of the screen and the keys firmer. The screen surface of an anti-glare display just isn't very hard - glossy glass is harder but can still be marked.\nUsing a quality micro fibre cloth with a 70% water/30% isopropyl alcohol solution is a good way to clean the marks off if they are not permanent. I have been using the cleaning solution provided by my optician for my glasses for years with no ill effects, and I love the iKlear blue microfibre cloths (for both glasses and displays). They call it \"terry\" as opposed to their \"chamois\" cloth.\n\nA: I have MBP 2017 without touch bar. I usually cary it with  Thule case which I am sure it does’t put pressure on my MBP. I have tried many solution to wipe the marks off  still having marks of the keyboard’s edge on my screen and it seems permanent. \n\nA: The short answer is you can't prevent these marks.\nIt's a design flaw. The screen doesn't have enough clearance, is in contact with the keyboard when closed, and gets marked.\nMy current laptop is a MacBook Pro 16 I bought in May, about four months ago, and noticed key marks on the screen straight away. I bought screen cleaner and a microfibre wipe, and with prompt cleaning can see marks appearing regularly.\nI have a (Bellroy) sleeve to protect the laptop, and transport it in a dedicated bag that is very lightly loaded; just an A5 notepad, water bottle, and small zip case for cables.\nThe good news is that this is a known issue at Apple. I opened a support request yesterday, during which the rep acknowledged Apple recognizes this problem, and was offered service.\nMy previous laptop was a MacBook Pro 13, which I kept for five years due to waiting out the the butterfly switch fiasco.\nThe 13 inch laptop had the same issue, and over time the key marks became permanent, as sweat, debris, oils, etc on my hands would have degraded the screen coating over time.\nMy 16 inch has the extended warranty, and I am going to just use as normal keeping the screen and keys as clean as possible. I'll take it in for service & get a new screen just before the warranty expires. Hopefully I can avoid any permanent marks in the interim.\nYou can leave feedback for Apple here https://www.apple.com/feedback/ but be aware you don't get a response.\n\nA: The Mac Book screen usually doesn't get marks, but if you put pressure on the mac, it will get marks. Since I go to school,I have layers of books along with my laptop, so it get marks. In order to get rid of it, just get a cloth and put Little water as possible. Then let it dry naturally, and it should be fine unless you got some water on the screen.\n\nA: I had keyboard prints on my 16 inch and have tried Windex. But it didn't work at all. Guess what works? Glass cleaner from a Dollar store. I spent 15 mins wiping it off with Bounty kitchen towel soaked in the cleaner, and voila, it came out good as new! The glass cleaner is called \"First Force, No Streak Glass Clear\". I've installed a screen protector so that I don't have to go through this again.\n\nA: I know this is old thread but I had to sign in to point one thing that no one here is sharing that for future references instead of going for a thin cloth or smth lol simply apply screen protector and I bet it won't ruin your panel it would only if you have a titanium key cap keyboard or smth lol\n", "Q: What kind of SSD is compatible with the 2010 Unibody MacBook? I'm considering buying a solid state drive for my Unibody White MacBook 2010. The trouble is, I have no idea what to look for. What kind of connector am I looking for? (SATA?) What size? I'm told to get the kind that Apple uses so that I don't void my AppleCare warranty. What model/brand(s) would that be? \n\nA: You're looking for any 2.5\" SATA drive. I'm not sure if the MacBooks came with SATA 3 (6 Gb/s) or SATA 2 (3 Gb/s), so you should match whichever the installed drive is. (There's no harm in putting a SATA 3 drive in a machine that only supports SATA 2, you just won't get the speed and you'll pay more.) You should be careful of 12.5mm height drives - they won't fit in some Macs. Anything smaller should be fine.\nSome references: \n\n\n*\n\n*mid-2010 MacBook manual – look in Chapter 3 for specifics on hard drive replacement\n\n*iFixit's MacBook repair guide – has better pictures than Apple's manual (I think this is the right one)\n\n\nA: Moshe, If you can find one instance of AppleCare being refused for a simple HD swap I'll be amazed. In fact I was surprised to find that it is not specifically allowed by AppleCare terms (linked below) as I had heard it was for Unibody models onwards.\nHaving said that, I don't think you can buy an Apple OEM drive anyway. \nI have had a horrible experience with \"iRam\" drives - installed fully on two of them, after sleep both came up completely blank! But this is not an isolated experience. Many SSDs will work at first and fail quickly. In my office we have had bad Kingston, OCZ and other brands. \nThe only one that I have found good so far (fingers crossed) is the OWC Extreme 6G series, and even then only after getting a bad one first and having to exchange. The new one from OWC bears a different label so I would say direct from OWC is the way to go, not from a reseller who may have older stock.\nCurrent Intel drives are highly regarded but I have not used one personally.\nI had started by saying that the AppleCare plan specifically allows you to change the hard drive as a user-serviceable part. But it doesn't. Then I interpreted \nThe Plan does not cover:\na Installation, removal, or disposal of the Covered Equipment, or installation, removal,\nrepair, or maintenance of non-Covered Equipment (including accessories, attachments, or other devices such as external modems) or electrical service external to the Covered Equipment;\nb Damage due to accident, abuse, neglect, misuse (including faulty installation, repair, or maintenance by anyone other than Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider),\n\nTo mean that you can't do it - but that could mean you only have a problem if you cause damage while doing it. And the limitation of warranty for performing an operation like that might be illegal depending on the laws of where you live anyway. \nBottom line is I would (and do) do it, and Apple do treat such altered machines as covered. The inclusion of instructionsto do so in the manual is a pretty strong hint that it's OK.\n\nA: Your Macbook will accept any standard 2.5\" SATA drive including the 240GB or 256GB models. \nThere's no limitation or compatibility issues with the size being 240GB, your Mac will recognize it and macOS will format and utilize the space just fine. Since this model has the space for a spinning hard drive, pretty much anything that's physically the same or smaller than the OEM drive will work.\nI just recently upgraded the drive in a 2007 White MacBook with a Kingston SSD Now 120GB with no issues. It's a standard SATA I interface and while the drive is SATA III, it is backward compatible.  The interface on the 2010 is SATA II (if memory serves) and will also be compatible with a SATA III drive. \nThe best piece of advice I can give is to use a drive from a brand that you trust.  Avoid no-name or generic brands.  Kingston, Samsung, PNY, and Crucial are all good, reliable brands to consider.\n\nA: Any SATA SSD up to 2TBs will work (2TBs + 16GBs RAM IF you've got your white 2010 Macbook's firmware upgraded to the latest version from Apple).

I have heard broadly about the so-called \"rise\" of the Mac viruses. Apparently, there is a \"whole new deluge\" of Mac viruses. So far, I have gotten nothing that I can see.\nBut I'm beginning to wonder if this is a real danger and if I should take steps to protect my computer. I know that the Mac OS is very secure - that's part of why I use it - but is antivirus needed? I'd prefer not to have to use it - I've seen many PCs with antivirus that are slow because of it - and also because of the cost. Maybe I've just gotten lucky.\nSo: Is antivirus software a necessity with the \"rise\" of mac viruses? \nI'd count Apple/security experts as good sources.\n\nA: I say no, and while MacDefender is not something I would ever install, it is an app you must install to be \"infected\" by it. Malware, crapware, bloatware or any other name it is not a virus which replicates itself without your knowledge or permission.\nIn a corporate environment you may be required to install some kind of email scanner because you will undoubtedly receive PC viruses in email from time to time - sometimes I have seen them arrive in hotmail etc. Having one may help stamp out the problem in the office but I have never encountered and never even read a reliable report of a Mac virus.\nIf you did want to install antivirus software, there's a good list in this AskDifferent answer - you might want to make an IT Manager happy, for instance.\nUpdate April 2: This is also not a virus but a trojan - but it is worth knowing about.\nArs Technica report on a new Trojan targeting Mac OS X\n\nA: Good security software does not just think of viruses\nAdvanced Windows security software usually includes other features besides (live-) scanning the computer for infections. They also provide protection from:\n\n*\n\n*Phishing attacks (attempts to steal your passwords)\n\n*Spyware (exploiting private information)\n\n*...\n\nOSX maintains a list of malicious software which you can update automatically (System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General).[1]\nIf you want advanced protection by a specialized company, I'd say go for it. But if you use your computer sensibly and browse the web carefully, there is no need.\nSecurity patches\nThe renown german IT website Heise says that Apple can take months to fix a known security vulnerability. Microsoft on the other hand, takes threat reports very seriously. They encourage communication with the 'community' in providing security patches. \"Replies from Apple are not to be taken for granted,\" they say.\nThird-party security companies generally provide protection from newly discovered threats quite fast.\nWorking in a Windows environment\nAt the university I exchange files via flash drives or emails on a regular basis with Windows users. Some of those flash drives have been exchanged between lots of users which led me to use antivirus software myself in order to minimize the possibility of transmitting threats.\nI've been using Sophos Mac Home (free) for a long time. Sophos updates it's signature list frequently. While the live-scan does not seem to add any significant CPU load most of the time, there are cases where it impacts the use quite noticeably. I'm thinking of repairing permissions lasting more than ten minutes instead of just one or spotlight indexing.\n1 - Heise reported that this list contains only a relatively little amont of signatures and a smart attacker can easily bypass it. As of now, this security features is rather to calm down the user than offering advanced protection. Their words are that \"any virusprotection software provides better a better solution\".  \n\nA: The whole \"immune to viruses\" myth is completely false. When Windows controlled 90% of the market share, Apple got away with \"security through obscurity.\" This means Macs were generally safe because the virus writers attacked the largest market, Windows; however, now that Apple has grown in popularity, more viruses have been reported, and the number will continue to increase. Since Apple has relied on obscurity, its security is actually very weak. It is easier to exploit a security hole on a Mac, but less have taken the time to do so.\nAlso, Macs are a bit nicer when they crash. Since there is no \"blue screen of death\" or scary error messages, many users never even suspect that a virus might have caused the crash.\nStill don't believe me, eh? Well, considering it only takes10 seconds to hack, I'd say there are some vulnerabilities.\n", "Q: How can I prevent certain tracks from going to iPod? I manually put music onto my iPod by dragging albums over from the library in iTunes.  For some albums, I don't want all of the tracks to copy over to the iPod - for example, audio commentaries and dialog tracks.  Short of deleting these tracks from my iTunes library, how can I prevent specific tracks from being copied over to the iPod when I place albums?\n\nA: I love the setting where you can only sync songs with the checkbox to one or more iOS devices.\n\nSimple deselect the songs by plalist, genre, or as you find them and even if they are in a playlist or genius mix that would normally install the song on your device during a sync, iTunes will suppress those songs that are not check marked.\n\nA: bmike's answer is correct; alternatively, you could select the album and hold ⌘ cmd while clicking the tracks you don't wish to copy. Then, drag the still-selected ones to the iPod.\n", "Q: How can I get iTunes to use iTunes Store Album Art? Some of my music in iTunes won't get Album Art via \"Get Album Art\".  (These might be tracks from physical CDs, or that I've purchased a long time ago from other MP3 stores.)  I'd like to use the iTunes Store's Album Art whenever possible, because when it exists, it's usually a better quality image than from those from web searches.  \nWhat do I have to do to my tracks to get the iTunes Album Art?  What properties of a track does iTunes use when matching Album Art?  \n\nA: What I usually do in this situation is look up the album in the iTunes Store.\n\n\n*\n\n*If it’s not available in the iTunes Store, I get the album art from some other source.\n\n*If it is available in the iTunes Store but “Get Album Art” doesn’t seem to do anything, there’s probably a mismatch in the meta data somewhere. Compare the Artist, Album Artist, and Album fields and make sure the fields in your local copy match those from the iTunes Store. Then try again.\n\n\nThis should take care of it in most cases. If that still doesn’t work, try adding a space after the album title and/or the artist name.\n", "Q: Simulate touchpad or gestures on iMac I recently started using a MacBook Air and find some of the gestures such as the double click zoom in Safari extremely useful, I'm aware I can zoom normally using cmd - (+) but find the gesture zoom much better. Can I simulate the touchpad or another way to do this on my iMac.\n\nA: You can use a Magic Trackpad with your iMac - that will let you perform all the same gestures as you use on your MacBook Air.\nThere are even neat accessories to make it one unit with your Apple Wireless Keyboard. The ones I know about are the Twelve South \"Magic Wand\" and the Henge \"Clique\".\n\nA: BetterTouchTool does exactly what I was after, you can set keyboard and mouse shortcuts to emulate gestures and a bunch of other stuff. You will also need SteerMouse if you want to map the buttons on your mouse to keystrokes then assign them inside BetterTouchTool to gestures etc.\nAfter some testing it's more of just a zoom not smart zoom but still works quite well; I'm happy enough with it.\n", "Q: How can I get persistent Dictionary popups to go away? In some applications, such as nvAlt, the Dictionary popup (accessed by double-tapping with three fingers or by using the Look Up command in the context menu) won't go away once called. The only solution I've found to make it close is to quit the program. Is there any way I can do it without quitting the application?\n\nA: This popover is built into the NSView class (showDefinitionForAttributedString:atPoint:). Since (as far as I can tell) it isn't controlled or powered by a distinct system process, it is completely owned by the app that owns the view where the popover was triggered.\nIn short, since the popover is owned solely by whatever app triggered it, there's no way to get rid of a stuck one without killing its parent app.\nFYI, if the popover isn't dismissed with the escape key or by clicking outside of its body, something has gone wrong. I would file a bug report with the developers of the app where this happens.\n\nA: In my case the popup came from hovering over a spotlight result and became stuck.

I've seen and used many laptops, and one of my favorites is the MacBook Pro. It has a nice, clean design - but most of all, it seems quite sturdy.\nAllegedly, this is due to the \"unibody\" design. However, I own a Dell Inspiron 1545 which is even stronger - I dropped it several times in multiple ways, see comment on accepted answer - and it is most definitely not unibody - in fact, it is the polar opposite. Almost every part of it can come apart.\nDoes the unibody design of the MacBook Pro and MacBook contribute at all to this strength, or is this strength from other factors, like the aluminum?\nPlease note: This is different from How tough is the aluminum body of a MacBook?. That question asks how strong the aluminum body is; I'm asking if the unibody design has anything to do with that strength or if 'unibody' is just a marketing term.\n\nA: There are some basic approaches to making a laptop as strong as it needs to be. One is the internal chassis, IBM Thinkpads (pre-Lenovo) were famous for having a cast magnesium chassis along with a metal skin - they defined \"business class\" and were much imitated. Another is the Toughbook approach. Another is unibody. If size and weight did not matter we'd probably all carry Toughbook-style machines because they're, ah, tough. Big rubber bumpers everywhere are pretty good protection, but unibody is the nicest compromise between toughness and size/weight. You get more toughness for a given size and weight by combining the skin with the chassis.\nBefore its introduction in laptops the idea of a monocoque design was well known in aircraft, automobiles, even armoured vehicles and rockets. Ignoring the structural strength of the skin material and relying on the strength of an internal chassis wastes weight. By using the skin for structure as well, there is no wasted space or weight. By making the skin a single rigid piece, structural integrity (not to mention appearance) is not harmed by joins or fasteners. By machining out what is unnecessary only, the case can be left stronger (thicker) where it matters, at the stress points. Cheaper laptops of a few years ago would flex and creak if not picked up with two hands, just the weight of the parts inside would cause the skin to deform. I can't flex my MBP 15\" at all, not even if I grab the sides and try to twist.\nAll materials being equal this design is responsible for the strength of the machine. As a material, aluminium (you may know it as aluminum) is desirable because:\n\n\n*\n\n*it is easy to source and relatively cheap\n\n*it is easy to treat for surface toughness (anodizing)\n\n*it is relatively light and strong\n\n*it is easy to machine\n\n*what is machined away is easy to recycle simply by sweeping the floor and re-casting\n\n\nAdditionally, unibody design can actually reduce cost by reducing the amount of parts in the laptop, by reducing the number of assembly steps and opportunities for failure during and after the manufacturing process.\nThe video here, at Apple's MacBook Pro page is the usual stuff with a lot of sexy shots of perfectly arranged MacBook Pros, you've seen it before. But the segments with huge billets of aluminium being extruded and then machined into unibody components are just incredible so watch it all!\n\"In many ways I think it's more beautiful internally than externally\" - Sir Jony Ive.\n\n(How do you know the Dell is even stronger? Destructive test results with photos, please :-)\n\nA: Yes - unibody design offers more strength at the same weight.\nThe idea of unibody design is not very new and not limited to manufacturing processes of the modern industry.\nE.g. you can find unibody-like designs in furniture quite often. An example is crafting a chair out of once piece of wood - or at least the same tree. This has several advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*all parts of the cover have the same thermal coefficient of expansion\n\n*all parts of the cover have the same heat conducting coefficient\n\nThose two points especially matter in the design of the portable Macs. They 'suffer' from extreme variations in temperatures which stresses the material. Unibody design causes the whole cover to expand at the same rate and thus avoids unpleasant side effects:\n\n*\n\n*Just little divergences can cause a bottom piece to not exactly fit a connected side piece. This creates tensions to the construction's edges and may result in unpleasant squeaking noises when you touch the device as attacking forces does not get distributed evenly over the whole construction.\n\nIn the unibody design, pieces are connected at the lowest level possible, making them...\n\n*\n\n*torsion-resistant\n\n*stiff\n\n*more stable at the same weight than a modular design for the body frame\n\n*higher customizable design (no limitations for connecting elements)\n\n\nA: Look at nature.  A lobster has an exoskeletal structure (shell is both skin and structure) while a mouse has an internal structure, where the skin has little structural value.\nThe lobster will not survive a long fall onto a hard surface without cracking its skin, but the mouse might survive from that same distance.\nThe mouse will not survive a certain steady weight placed on top of it, but the lobster might.\nEach structure has its own benefits, and you can't strictly say that one is stronger than another.\nIf your environment involves a lot of falls and dropping, it's possible for one style of laptop architecture to survive better than another.  If it involves being placed in a bookbag with 40 pounds of books on top, it might survive better with one architecture than another.\nNeither base structure is better, stronger, or worse in every environment.  The designers can, of course, take a little from both (and other) structure basics, and attempt to find a moderate solution that provides enough strength for all scenarios they believe their products will be subject to, but they all involve tradeoffs.\nThe unibody design is the strength of the macbook line.  Being machined from a solid billet of aluminum means you get better flexibility than cast aluminum (ie, less brittle), and the fact that the skin is thicker than the skin on most laptops lends additional strength.\nHowever, Apple does this primarily for looks, and they have made many tradeoffs to increase the laptop's appeal.  For instance, the screen has very little protection, and the aluminum flexes enough that the screen may break under the wrong impact.  Laptops with a different structure can protect the screen better.  Not because the unibody design is inherently weaker, but the way Apple implemented that design to increase appeal at the cost of robustness means that Apple's overall design is weaker for that particular use case or environment.\n", "Q: What has changed Finder list view in Lion to make \"Calculate all sizes\" exponentially faster? Since way before Mac OS X came on the scene, we have been able to ask the Finder to Calculate all sizes in order to determine the sum total of readable file size space contained in each folder for the Finder window in question.\n\nI have tested List view sizing of folders on several Macs where it doesn't matter if an SSD is present or not, but Lion is so fast at calculating sizes I am curious if there is some new caching data structure or if Finder is using the metadata information from Spotlight or a similar database to speed up this calculation immensely.\n\nA: Before Lion, the File Size column in Finder.app would display the size each file requires on the hard disk, not the exact file size. For example, 1 byte files were displayed as 4 KB because they do in fact take up 4 KB of space on a HFS-formatted system. There was no easy way to see the actual file size of 1 byte, other than opening File › Get Info (or using a different app, like Terminal.app and then using ls -lsa, or a Finder.app replacement like TotalFinder.app).\n(Back in the day, I reported this as bug 8926275 on bugreport.apple.com.)\nAs of Lion, this behavior has been corrected, and the File Size column will now show the exact file size for each file rather than the size it allocates on the hard disk (which depends on the file system anyway).\nSince these sizes are the same numbers you’d get from the ls binary in Terminal, they’re much more efficient to calculate.\n\nA: I have not observed Lion to be faster at calculating folder (and package/bundle) sizes during the first time it calculates sizes in a folder. However, subsequent calculations in the same folder do seem to be much faster.\nPart of the perceived quickness may be that Finder will immediately show the previously calculated sizes in gray text while it recalculates folder sizes, rather than showing \"--\" until it's been calculated. After a folder's size has been recalculated, the number will update (if the size has changed) and turn black.\nBecause the Finder is observably caching previously calculated folder sizes, it's possible that it's only recalculating sizes for folders that have changed since the last time it was calculated.\n\nA: Starting with OS X Lion, Apple has added a SQLite database that the OS uses for file tracking in system features such as Spotlight. Querying from a SQLite database rather than inspecting the file system every time is more than likely the cause for the performance improvement. John Siracusa's OS X Lion review explains in depth the changes to the file system in Lion. Particularly, here you will find an explanation on the new SQLite database. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: I wouldn't be surprised if they were using Spotlight metadata to cache file sizes. If you're already using FSEvents to track all changes in the file system and (potentially) Time Machine to back all those changes up, the added cost of calculating and storing aggregate file sizes is negligible.\n", "Q: How can I make a flash drive with a portable app that runs without admin permission? I'd like to have a flash drive with my common programs on it. That, combined with SkyDrive, allows me to be productive anywhere.\nUnfortunately, I can't do this on Macs that don't give me admin permission. I get the portable app, download it to a flash drive on my PC, plug it in to a Mac, and lo and behold, it doesn't work. It needs admin permission.\nIs it possible for me to download/create a portable app that I can run without admin permission?\n\nA: You can run an App no matter where it is located - even on a write protected volume unless the app is severely non-standard and attempts to write to the application directory or self-modify itself.\nAre you certain that there are not some other form of managed preferences or parental controls enabled that is restricting non-whitelisted apps?\n", "Q: Where are all those audio files on the iPhone?

When it's straightened out, and the monitor is connected after the system has started, everything is working okay. I've tested that for a couple of weeks now.\n\nA: I know from experience that this cannot be fixed. There is a big compatability issue with OSX Lion and some Dell monitors. I used a MacBook Pro on Snow Leopard with a Dell monitor just fine. I upgraded to Lion, and now it doesnt work at all, hoiwever the monitor works with other computers (PC's)\nMy advice here is to take the macBook and monitor into an Apple store and get them to have a look, there may be a chance someone can get it to work, but not in my local store sadly. \nFailing that, you may need to buy a different monitor.\n", "Q: Share calculations with others from OS X If there an easy way to share calculations from OS X with others?

However when booted into Windows it should be able to pick up the drivers from Windows Update or you can simply download and install drivers manually for any Windows compatible PCI Express graphics card. \n\nA: Often you can flash a card intended for PC and \"transform\" it into the Mac version that sells for much more money. Here's one example of a site showing how.\nYou know the advantage, which is cost. The disadvantage is you rely on the kindness of strangers for support, you trust programmers you know next to nothing about and if it goes wrong you could end up with a dead card and it will cost you more than if you bought a Mac version in the first place. Then there's the highly questionable legality of someone ripping the ROM off a card and letting you download it.\nPersonally I would find a second-hand Mac version of the card you want, if you run headless you don't need any real performance and you should be able to find something old and relatively cheap. Just watch out for the people on eBay who flash cards and sell them as the Mac version when they are not.\n", "Q: Boot from USB on MacBook 1.1 (early 2007) I’m trying to install Windows 8 from USB on my MacBook 1.1 (early 2007).\nI have tried booting using rEFIt (on 10.6): \n\n\n*\n\n*Partition my USB key as MBR: the Windows 8 logo fish stays stuck forever.\n\n*Partition my USB key as GPT: same problem.\n\n\nI didn’t try to boot Linux EFI from USB but I think it would be the same fail.\nI’m really wondering if the problem comes from the MacBook firmware or the way I try to load the Windows installer.\nHow would you proceed on the Apple generation of MacBook?\n\nA: I was able to install Windows 8.1 by\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a BOOTCAMP partition using the 10.6 Boot Camp tool (latest version available for 32-bit Macs)\n\n*Creating a Windows 7 USB stick on a PC using http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool\n\n*Install rEFInd http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/\n\n*Start Windows Windows 7 installation\n\n*During disk/partiton select, choose to format the BOOTCAMP partition as NTFS (still, it refused to install)\n\n*Restart Windows installer, second time it would recognise partition as valid\n\n*Install Windows 7\n\n*Update to Windows 8\n\n\nHowever, the Apple drivers for MacBook1,1 is pretty outdated unfortunately. Also, I would say that Windows 7 is a more appropriate OS for MacBook1,1.\n\nA: This MacBook should support booting from USB as referenced here Starting from an external USB storage device (Intel-based Macs)\nHowever as noted in the knowledge base article:\n\nIf you use Boot Camp, you may not be able to boot natively into supported versions of Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista operating systems installed on external USB hard drive.\n\nThis can probably be extrapolated to USB boot media as well.\nAccording to the Bootcamp 3.0 installation guide it seems to hint that a install CD / DVD disk is required:\n\nImportant: You must use a single full-install Windows installation disc. You cannot use an upgrade version of Windows. If you’re installing Windows XP, you must use Service Pack 2 or later. You cannot install an earlier version of Windows XP and then attempt to update it later.\n\nMac OS versions up to OS X Lion and MS Windows versions up Windows 7 32 bit  are officially supported to boot on this Mac according to \nEveryMac's MacBook 1,1 notes on supported operation systems\n\nA: I have a MacBook2,1. I wasn't able to boot from USB during Alt/Option boot selection (Maybe because Boot Camp Assistant disabled USB boot?).\nWhat I did was burn Ultimate Boot CD to a CD and booted it. In HDD > Boot Management, there is Plop Boot Manager. In Plop, select USB boot.\nThe Windows USB flash drive must be formatted using MBR partition scheme and without Rufus MBR. The Rufus MBR prompts to press any key to boot, which does not work on the old MacBook.\n", "Q: What Database programs/tools are included with OS X? Many years ago I believe Apple included a copy of Hypercard with it's OS.  That's before my time, and I have never used it.\nBut, I do have occasional requirements for very simple databases.  I am not talking full relational database systems necessarily, a flat file \"cardview\" system would be suitable for most of my needs.\nMy question is simply what tools does are provided that enable simple database style data files to be created and accessed.  Graphical would be preferred, (although I am fairly sure that no such thing exists) but command line tools may be fine also, and there are a vast range of Unix/Linux style tools included so it's not beyond the bounds of possibility that some are either suitable, or at least able to be co-opted with a bit of scripting to provide a minimal database app.\nI am aware of (and indeed own) third party database software such as Bento, and I am not looking to replace it or acehive it's levels of customisation.  They key is that the tool must be pre-installed with Mac os X 10.7, and not require me to download anything extra.\nI have experimented with creating a custom Address book datafile with custom fields and using the Address Book front end for entering data and searchign etc, but with limited success (mainly in that I cannot subsquently use my real address book easily).\n\nA: Sadly, the database tools that ship with OS X Lion are special purpose tools and lack an interface building toolkit. Apple implemented Core Storage for developers and not end users to use and a similar path seems to be likely for iCloud in the next year. The address book is the only card like storage GUI and adapting it for purposes other than storing contacts is painful to say the least.\nLet's look over the open source projects included with OS X v10.7.3 that ship and call out the candidate database and key-value store frameworks you could possibly bend to your wishes:\n\n\n*\n\n*BerkelyDB\n\n*OpenLDAP\n\n*PostgreSQL\n\n*SQLite\n\n*WebKit\n\n*libsecurity_keychain\nI'll leave the various programming languages off the list since that's more of a Stack Overflow answer, but none of these is ready to go with a simple card based graphical user interface. If I had to pick one tool to re-implement hypercard, I would start with WebKit's implementation of HTML 5's client side database storage and use Safari for layout / user interface. This would likely need javascript knowledge as well as HTML / CSS to pull off a workable solution.\nIn a similar way, you could take tk and one of the programming languages to build up your database and UI logic and hook into your favorite data store listed above. Also, don't overlook iCloud's key-value store since it could arguably be considered \"shipping with Lion.\"\nYour constraint of not needing to install additional software is limiting since Apple no longer ships a tool that both stores data and has any sort of usable UI. Even automator can store variables, but you'd be hard pressed to make something of it in practice.\n\nLeaving the run only what is installed constraint opens the gates to many solutions. The best (as of today) card based studying app seems to be Mental Case, but it lacks the database aspect and simple programmability of Hypercard.  I haven't seen a single viable hypercard replacement that ships on the App Store, so perhaps some developer will provide exactly the tool needed to fill the gap left by Hypercard. \n\nA: MySQL used to be installed on Mac OS X by default but it is gone with Lion*. PostgreSQL is now installed standard but it is only available from the command line. \nOf course with Xcode you have the ability to use Core Data also, for development - built on sqlite as are many OS X internals.\nFor users wanting something graphical, buying Bento or something similar is probably the best option. I you choose to work with PostgreSQL then pgAdmin is a good configuration GUI, and free.\nBottom line, if you don't want to install anything else, learn to love PostgreSQL command line.\n*since Oracle now own it, licensing has tightened up. I downloaded it to use for a Rails project and very soon after had an email from Oracle asking which license I was thinking of buying... This new ownership is maybe what prompted the change for Apple.\n\nA: If Bento is too powerful for you, perhaps you can keep your information in a text file. I would have suggested a spreadsheet, but you specify that you want to work only with pre-installed software.\n", "Q: Mac OS X freezes while choosing a keyboard after reset Lion back to the Setup Assistant I have a problem with my MacBook Pro, which runs Mac OS X Lion.\nI have reset it back to the Setup Assistant.\nAfter I executed the following commands, I need to select the region when I boot; this works fine, but when I choose the keyboard, the whole Mac gets stuck, and I see the loading icon on the screen. Even if I wait one hour, nothing happens.\n$ mount -uw /\n$ rm -R /Library/Preferences/\n$ rm -R /Users/username/\n$ rm /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/username.plist\n$ rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nHow can I solve this? I have no Mac OS X disc to reinstall Lion.\nCan I create a user via the command line, or skip the setup assistant?\n\nA: Sounds like a bad install. I suggest booting the computer into the hidden Recovery partition by holding ⌘ Cmd-R at startup and doing an internet recovery system restore. It'll be the second option in the OS X Utilities window that comes up. As long as the iMac is connected to the internet it'll re-download the installer and restore a fresh system to the drive.\nIf you're trying to bring the MacBook back to the way it was when you purchased it I'd suggest opening the Disk Utility in recovery first and erasing the drive completely. (But only if there's no important data on it!)\n\nA: Ok, so I had the same issue on my Mid 2010 MacBook Pro, and I fixed it by holding down shift and booting into safe mode into the setup assistant. It flows smoothly, and before it stopped exactly where you failed at.\n\nA: \nHow can I solve this? I have no Mac OS X disc to reinstall Lion.\n\nYou don’t need one. Here’s how you can buy or create a Lion installer USB stick or DVD.\n\nA: It may help to remove the file at /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist (this file contains information related to the current time zone). Alternately, you may be able to remove /Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist (which contains keyboard layout settings) to get the setup assistant to complete normally.\n", "Q: How can I use multiple browser versions at one time?

This support document describes increased fan speeds as a symptom of SMC problems and how to reset the SMC\n", "Q: Writing equations inline in Mac Word This may be just something that I'm going to have to lose with the conversion from PC to Mac, but:\nOn the Windows version of Word 2011, when you click equation, the program immediately goes into equation mode and you can start typing the equation right there on the line.  Once you're done, you just hit the right arrow key to exit.  If you want to edit the equation, just click in it and the cursor will move inside it.  It's incredibly convenient for someone who has to use equation mode every ten seconds to add an integral or something, like me.\nOn the Mac version, equation is a button that you press.  A window comes up (it takes about five seconds to appear), and then you have to type your equation in the window and click X.  If you want to edit the equation, click on it and the window will pop back up.  It's very inconvenient and makes writing math documents take a lot longer.\nIs there a way to get the Mac version to behave like the Windows version?\n\nA: The 2007 version of Word for Mac was quite different from the Windows counterpart and Microsoft didn't maintain a 1:1 release schedule for the Windows version and the Mac version. Consequently the Windows version got ahead of the Mac version and this can lead to some confusion and frustration with the different behaviours when you move between then platforms.\nThe good news is if you upgrade to Office for Mac 2011 you'll get inline equation editing in Word that works very much the same as the Windows counterpart. And it's as fast as the Windows counterpart on similar hardware.\n\n", "Q: Finder jumping to currently selected item When I am browsing a long list of items, and have one of the items selected (whether above or below the current viewing area/viewport), quite often it jumps up or down to show the currently selected item - which is super annoying.

Is there any suggestions as to how to fix this?\nThank you!\n\nA: Simply press \"esc\" to de-select an entry and you'll be able to scroll to your heart's content without the annoyance of jumping back to a selection.\n\nA: Are you talking about Column view? If so, then this isn't a bug, it's a feature... This behavior of Finder was already in Snow Leopard (and possibly previous versions as well):\nWhenever you select another child folder in a column, the column left to it scrolls up or down just enough rows to show the current selected folder's parent.

Then, there are free apps like CoverSutra but those don’t do what I want exactly.\nIs there free app which shows name of the song that VLC or iTunes plays in menu bar?\n\nA: Try the following freeware/open source tool: QuickTunes.\n\nElderly, but may work fine still.\n\nA: My minimalistic solution involves using GeekTool to display a geeklet like the one I made on top of the menu bar. It runs an AppleScript every 10 seconds and will unobtrusively display nothing when iTunes is not running or not playing, otherwise just show the current track's name.\n\nAdvantages: you can resize, position and format the text of the geeklet as you wish (e.g. put it in the very center of the menu bar – something the freeware programs discussed here can't do), as well as have it display additional info such as album, artist, etc. by editing the AppleScript. See here for ideas.\nDisadvantages: The geeklet's position is fixed. When your front application uses a lot of space on the left-hand side of the menu bar, the geeklet will be shown on top of the rightmost menu items. This problem is, of course, more relevant for small display sizes.\n\nA: I've just found Tune Buddy which does exactly what I wanted:\n\nI'll check other apps latter, thank everybody who answered…\n\nA: Simple iTunes is a simple iTunes menu bar application which displays current track (Song - Artist) playing in iTunes in menu bar.\nhttps://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/47609/simple-itunes\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4958098?start=0&tstart=0\n\n\n\n\nA: You Control: Tunes\n...is free, but requires an email address to receive a serial.\n\n*\n\n*access the whole iTunes library via the menubar\n\n*access playlists via the menubar\n\n*see the current song in the menubar\n\n*see player controls in the menubar\n\n*notifications\n\n*change rating on the fly\n\n \n\nA: After having been on iTunesMenu for years I decided it was best to move on, considering the crashes.\nSo I found SmashTunes: nice and simple, plus it drops the radio station name (which is usually extremely long and just as useless)\n\nEdit: now I prefer Tune Buddy, suggested in an answer above.\n\nA: It may not be exactly what you want, but the best I can suggest is Vox which is free and displays the player controls in the menubar, which you can click on to get the currently playing song (and the current playlist).

Open Finder, Applications/Safari, \"right-click\" Get info (or command + \"i\"), uncheck \"Open in 32 bit\", restart Safari. Hope that helps!\nAfter the fact: Apple released Safari 5.1.5 this afternoon. The update addresses this 32-bit issue specifically.\n\n\nA: Try to disable all the plugins and see if it works then.\nYou said you cleared your browser cache, did you try to \"Reset Safari\"?

Host keys are stored in ~/.ssh/known_hosts in the user's home directory.  Addition-\n     ally, the file /etc/ssh_known_hosts is automatically checked for known hosts.  Any new hosts are auto-\n     matically added to the user's file.  If a host's identification ever changes, ssh warns about this and\n     disables password authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could\n     otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption.\n\nIn essence - either the key changed, the host name changed or the IP address changed and ssh is warning you that one or more of these do not match. You can turn off the storing, the warning or clear the cache if you don't care to investigate more. This is a very useful tool for people that ssh into fixed servers and need to know when things like the above change.\n", "Q: Will an iOS reinstall make a jailbroken iOS device \"unjailbroken\" and “supported by Apple” again? Will an iOS reinstall\n\n\n*\n\n*Work on any jailbroken-iPhone and\n\n*Make a jailbroken-iPhone \"unjailbroken\"?\n\n*Make a jailbroken-iPhone \"supported by Apple\"?\n\n\nSimilarly, does such an iOS reinstall reset the iPhone (jailbroken or not) back to a \"clean, factory default\" state?\nMy near-term purpose: I have an iPhone 4S running iOS 5.1 I'd like to jailbreak to at least install better Google Voice integration like GVIntegrated.\n\nA: Apple cannot tell if you've previously been jailbroken if you do a full restore. Apple has a tutorial on how to do this (support article HT201252).\nJailbreaking only affects the software, and restoring a jailbroken device to an official version of the iOS firmware will make your device \"not jailbroken.\" Doing a full restore can be done to any device regardless of whether or not they are currently or have previously been jailbroken.\nDoing a full restore will set the device back to factory defaults for that version of iOS. A full restore erases everything including /private/var/ where all your personal data is stored. If you do an update instead of a full restore, data from the jailbreak could be left behind, since an update leaves files from the previous version.\nAdditional Information\nThere is one part of an iOS device called the NVRAM that persists even across a full restore. The NVRAM contains environment variables that are needed for the device to boot. If you have gone out of your way to make modifications to your NVRAM, it can reveal that you have been jailbroken since these modifications can only be made from a jailbroken state. If you don't know how to make modifications to your NVRAM or you've never heard of NVRAM, then don't worry, this doesn't apply to you.\n\nA: One word, yes.\nRestoring the iPhone (in iTunes) will make it \"Not jailbroken\".\nTo avoid trouble and if you want to make sure all residual files are removed I would recommend restoring in DFU mode using the latest iOS firmware and setup the device as a new iPhone after the restore.\nI had to use jailbroken iPhones for testing and this worked for me, no application ever complained that the phones are jailbroken after a full restore.\n\nA: Fwiw.  Spoke with an Apple rep at a retail, brick-and-mortar (sort of) Apple Store today.  Rep said that he actually worked to confirm a customer's iPhone hardware prob by reinstalling iOS on customer's jailbroken phone, and that it was \"totally cool\" by him, no known (or at least strict) Apple policy against such a thing.\n\nA: Ostensibly there is no difference between a brand new phone running 5.1, and one that was jailbroken, and then restored via a full reinstall to the same OS Level.  It should not leave any traces of it's history in there, so long as you set it up as a new iphone in iTunes, and do not subsequently throw a restore over the top which could reasonably be expected to hold old data etc.\n\nA: It does not only make it supported by Apple again, it will also clear possible malware out of your device which is a very good thing :)\n", "Q: How do I stop email reminder from iCal? I'm using Google calendar, and I subscribe to my Google Calendar from multiple computers.  Whenever I set an event with (an) email reminder(s) on Google calendar, I'll get multiple emails because (1) Google calendar itself sends me the email reminder and (2) each computer that subscribes the calendar tries to send the email reminder (when the computer wakes up).  It's very annoying.\n\nA: You can disable all alerts, including email alerts, in ical via\niCal --> Preferences --> Advanced --> Turn off all alarms\n\nIf you need to have iCal display alarms on the mac, but simply not send the email, then you will need to turn to other software.  Here are two applications that help tame iCal notifications:\nhttp://www.nhoj.co.uk/icalreplychecker/ \n\n\n*\n\n*This should allow you to define what emails get sent.  It's primary use is taming meeting schedule notifications that iCal sends when you schedule a meeting with multiple participants, but it looks like it can be used to better configure what emails iCal sends\n\n\nhttp://cleancutcode.com/calendarbar/\n\n\n*\n\n*This tracks your calendars (iCal, or google directly) and use growl to alert you for upcoming events.  Use this if you want to disable emails by disabling all iCal alerts, and then setting this up to receive the alerts on the mac that you want to receive onscreen.\n\n\nA: I created a filter in gmail to delete these alert emails.\nIt's not a perfect solution, but I do want to be able to receive alerts in iCal, and I want to receive email alerts from Google Calendar as well. This meets both of those requirements, but it's definitely a workaround.\n\nA: For Mac OS X Mountain Lion  10.8.0:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the \"Calendars\" button on the main window to show the sidebar of calendars.\n\n*Right mouse click on the calendar you want to ignore alerts from & choose \"Get Info\"\n\n*Check ON \"Ignore Alerts\" & click \"OK\"\n\n\nSeems as thought you don't have to globally set this preference, you can now selectively choose which calendars have alerts or not, through iCal.\n\nA: as far as i understand iCal it is on the \"receivers/subscribers\" side to deal with email-updates (and not on the \"senders/changers\" side) ...\nto NOT get email notification about updated events from a shared calendar you subscribed to you have to uncheck \"events affect availability\" in that calendars \"info\" (mac os X.7 and X.8: iCal —> calendars dropdown —> right click on the subscribed calendar —> choose \"get info\" from the context-menu —> uncheck \"events affect availability\")\nthis availability-logic kind of makes sense once you think about it ... problem is: \"events affect availability\" is checked by default for any newly subscribed shared calendar\nhere is a screenshot of the calendar-info-window: https://discussions.apple.com/message/20506464#20506464\n", "Q: What type of storage does an iPod classic use?

So as long as your iTunes library is on your external drive, your AppleTV will have access to it. The method for moving your iTunes library to another drive has been well covered on this site. I suggest you check out:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/31393/292\nThere are some things to consider when moving your iTunes library to an external drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*External drive access can be slower, especially if it's over an already busy USB buss, so take that in to consideration if you need to stream multiple high definition videos out of the box at the same time.

A video screen capture tool, and a movie to gif conversion tool.\nLook at these two questions for possible solutions:\nScreen video capture application\nHow can I convert a .mov into a .gif (or a .apng)?\nThere don't seem to be that many apps that do the movie --> gif conversion on OS X, though.  A lot of people use VLC to capture frames and imagemagick to collect them back together into an animated gif.  This is probably why the only answer to the conversion question above used an online service.\nManual process:\nThere is a way to do it in OS X without an additional tool, and this works well if, for instance, you just want to show someone the sequence of steps to disable a particular system preference.  The basic process is this:\n\n*\n\n*Use Cmd-shift-4-spacebar to capture a screenshot of the window for each frame.\n\n*Convert the images to gif (or set your screenshot preferences to gif prior to capturing the screenshots)\n\n*Open the last screenshot in preview.\n\n*Open the sidebar in preview\n\n*Show the screenshots in finder, ordered by date\n\n*Select the remainder to the screenshots, drag and drop them directly on top of the icon in the sidebar of preview for the file already opened.  If you drop them elsewhere it won't add them properly.\n\n*Preview the animation by selecting the top icon in the sidebar, then using the down arrow.  Rearrange any that are out of order using the sidebar to drag and drop.\n\n*Save the document as gif, and then preview using a browser, or another app that shows animated gifs.\n\nThis technique is somewhat limited in that you can't easily capture video frames without pausing the video before each capture (for that you should get a video screencapture program and then convert the resulting mov or avi to animated gif), and you can't readily adjust the frame time for each frame.\nThere's a more detailed tutorial with example here:\nhttp://ipliance.com/index.php/eng/Blog/Howto-Animated-GIF-s-Creation-and-Display-in-OS-X\n\nA: Cleanshot X has support for this feature (Available through SetApp, otherwise you can buy the base tier for $29, or subscribe for $8 a month).

(I.e., if you can go back to a previous page but not forward, you can bounce on the right side but not the left. If you can't go back or forward, you can bounce on both sides. If you can go back and forward, you can't bounce on either side.) If you have two-finger back and forward gestures off (as I do), you still can't bounce laterally (which is very annoying, as I like to idly bounce the webpages as I read them). \n\nA: This issue has been removed with the latest Chrome update (18.0.1025.142).\nYou can read more about the update here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stable Channel Release 18.0.1025.142\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to move the position of the Dock?

Or how to login as root user in apache server because following php script showing you are logged in as \n<?php echo `whoami`; ?>\n\n\nnobody.\n\n\nA: There really isn't a good reason to run your web server as root. It opens you up to all kinds of potential abuse. OS X defaults to running the service as a severely under privileged user to protect you.\nDon't make these changes unless you're absolutely certain you know what you're doing!\nThe httpd.conf file for the default Apache2 installation that comes with OS X can be found in /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf. Before you make any changes to this file BACK IT UP! That way you can get back to a sane starting place if you make a catastrophically bad change.\nOpen the file in a text editor and look for the following lines:\n# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run\n# httpd as root initially and it will switch...\n#\n# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.\n# It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for\n# running httpd, as with most system services.\n#\nUser _www\nGroup _www\n\nThe _www user/group is the default for OS X. If you want to run the server as root you'll need to change this to the appropriate user. For root:\nUser root\nGroup wheel\n\nThe plist that describes the Apache service to launchd is at /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist -- OS X runs any launchd runs daemons described in this location as root so the server starts with sufficient privledges to change context to another user.\nOnce you've made the changes, restart Apache with:\nsudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart\n\nand you should be running as root.\nAgain: BE CAREFUL DOING THIS!\n", "Q: Snap/Maximize function has stopped working.

I'm using OS X Lion, and there is a feature that I use all the time with my Thunderbolt display.\nSpecifically, if I grab the title bar and drag it to the top-center of my display, it expands the window size to the full size of my display.  If I drag the title bar to either the left or right of the screen, it fills 50% of the display, on that side.\nAll of a sudden, this functionality has disappeared.  I haven't been playing around with my computer preferences, either.\nIs there a chance that I've hit some type of keyboard shortcut and accidentally cut it off?  Or, is there some preference setting (which I've tried my hardest to find) that I can check to see if this functionality has been cut off?\nUPDATE\nThis is my first Mac.  It was purchased by my company for an iOS project that I've been given to complete.  My boss had setup some aspects of the machine before he passed it off to me-- I doubt he would have installed a third-party app because that's not how he works.\nI did, however, install a third-party app that I used to make a few minor sensitivity tweaks to my magic mouse.  I know that app was a bit of over-kill for me, but I may have set some feature in it.\nThe odd thing is, I don't recall keeping that application, nor can I find it in my app folder.  Oh well.  Thanks for the helpful tips.  I'll restart and see if that helps.\nIt's unbelievable how much you can miss such a simple feature until it's gone.\n\nA: This is not a feature provided by OSX.\nYou must have an extension installed  which adds this feature. e.g. BetterSnapTool or BetterTouchTool.\nMaybe everything is fine and the applications just crashed.

You probably had a third-party addon you were using to emulate Windows' Aero Snapping feature.\nThere are many of these utilities, but the first one that comes to mind is Cinch.  \nDoing a quick search in the Mac App Store brings up quite a few titles that do this, including HyperDock, BetterSnapTool, DoublePane, Divvy, and Split Screen.

I'd like to use iCloud, but my Macbook Air only has OS X 10.5.8, which is too old for iCloud.  Is there a web-based interface for iCloud that I could use to edit iCloud-synced things like contacts?\n\nA: Since your iPhone let you sign up for an iCloud account, you have full access to the web services provided by iCloud.com, which include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contacts\n\n*Calendars\n\n*Mail\n\n*Find My iPhone\n\n\nYou are only limited by your computer, but still have access to the web tools. \nThere may be (unsupported) ways to get some of these applications on your 10.5 Mac to sync, especially with Mail. Most of iCloud uses standard networking protocols, and therefore older programs may be able to use them. One may want to tread lightly though, since this is unsupported, and may cause issues/corruption in other parts that are supported (ie, you wouldn't want to edit your contacts in a way on 10.5 even if you could, since it could break them on your iPhone).\n\nA: Other than Apple developed tools, such as at iCloud.com, there are none.\nApple has not yet release an iCloud API and keys for web development.  Currently they  only supply the necessary information and SDK for OS X and iOS developers to access iCloud.  This restricts developers from developing iCloud apps for the web, windows, android, or any other platform.\nSo no, you won't find a general interface that permits editing iCloud entries via anything other than OS X and iOS - at least not yet.  Perhaps Apple will open the doors to alternative APIs later, or someone will reverse engineer the API and release the details.  Even if it is reverse engineered the keys and authorization sequence will make it difficult, if not impossible, to keep such a service online without Apple eventually revoking the keys once they determine they are being improperly used.\n\nA: https://www.icloud.com/\nYou can edit your contacts and calendar events here.

After keeping my MacBook Pro open for an hour or so, it will creak loudly when I close it. Is this normal? If not, what should I do about it? It's a late 2011 MacBook Pro 13\".\n\nA: This is not normal. I had a very similar problem with a unibody Aluminium MacBook (they only sold them for a short time in 2008. This is nearly the exact same case as the MBP that you have, except your Pro did actually have minor updates to help alleviate the problems we had in our MacBook. \nThe problem would only appear after the machine had warmed up for a little bit. The hinge would make a creaking noise when closing, and as it got worse, when opening. It also would stay hinged just slightly open (not waking from sleep) when being carried in a laptop bag. \nThis was due to an issue in the hinge on the keyboard part. Apple replaced two screens for us. The problem would fix it self for a month or two, but them come back. They finally redid the entire top half of the machine, and it worked great for 9 months. \n2 months out of warranty, it happened again. Due to having over 3 repair attempts (there were actually 4), Apple instead offered us a replacement machine. We were told at that time that there were quite a few reports of this problem, and they had been addressed in the latest rev of the MBP. Since the unibody MB was no longer available, they upgraded us to the base 13\" MacBook Pro. Im assuming that while it mostly had been fixed through minor updates, there may be one with a similar problem now and then.\nThe problem is related to the hinge design, and I have only seen it affect 13\" models. I would highly recommend taking it to the Apple store and having it replaced. They will not replace the whole top part on the first try, only the display. \n\nA: No.  You should take it to an Apple genius and have them evaluate it for repair or replacement.  It indicates that the hinges are either misadjusted, or have become damaged.  \n", "Q: What's the best way to place 4 pictures on a A4 sheet using the mac?

The challenge\nI would like to convert a large collection of WAV files to AAC using the \"iTunes Plus\" setting in iTunes. iTunes describes this setting as:\n\n128 kbps (mono) / 256 kbps (stereo), 44.100 kHz, VBR, optimized for MMX/SSE2.\n\nI would like to automate this import process.\nTrial and error\nThe afconvert command line tool can convert between audio file formats. I've tried a few settings and the closest I could get is:\nafconvert -v -d aac -b 256000 -f m4af -q 127 -s 2 --soundcheck-generate input.wav output.m4a\nSo: be verbose (-v), use the AAC data format (-d aac), encode at 256 kbps (-b 256000), store in the Apple MPEG-4 Audio file format (-f m4af), use the highest quality (-q 127), use VBR constrained (-s 2) and add SoundCheck data to the file.\nI've also created an m4a file using the iTunes Plus setting.\nThe m4a file created by afconvert is about the same size as the iTunes file; just 65536 bytes smaller.\nResults\nUsing the afinfo tool, I compared the file generated by iTunes to the file generated by afconvert. There are two differences in the afinfo output:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file generated by iTunes has an audio data file offset of 131072, the one by afconvert 65536. This explains the difference in file size\n\n*Somehow the file generated by iTunes has different sound check values than the one converted by afconvert:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes file:\nsc ave perceived power coeff             343 407\nsc max perceived power coeff             6873 8940\nsc peak amplitude msec                   154389 194861\nsc max perceived power msec              194025 194025\nsc peak amplitude                        31129 30928\n\n\n*afconvert file:\nsc ave perceived power coeff             341 388\nsc max perceived power coeff             6087 4157\nsc peak amplitude msec                   212509 152323\nsc max perceived power msec              215481 185017\nsc peak amplitude                        31024 29857\n\nEspecially the sc peak amplitude msec and sc max perceived power msec values differ quite a lot. These are the exact same input files, what could cause this difference?\nQuestion\nIs there a way to get results even closer to the \"iTunes Plus\" setting?\n\nA: I had the exact same obsession, and ended up creating a FLAC-to-iTunes importer that decodes FLAC files to WAV and imports them into iTunes using iTunes' own encoder: https://github.com/cbguder/FLAC2iTunes\nIt should be easy enough to modify FLAC2iTunes to support direct WAV input.\nAs for the soundcheck values, I compared iTunes, XLD and afconvert by encoding WAV files to AAC and decoding them back to WAV and comparing the decoded audio data. I also compared afinfo outputs for the encoded files. While the souncheck values are different for each file, the decoded WAVs are exactly the same, so even if you use XLD or afconvert, the chances are the resulting files will sound exactly the same.\nFor afconvert, I used the parameters suggested by Apple in the \"Mastered for iTunes\" guide, with an intermediate CAF file:\nafconvert source.wav intermediate.caf -d 0 -f caff --soundcheck-generate\nafconvert intermediate.caf -d aac -f m4af -u pgcm 2 --soundcheck-read -b 256000 -q 127 -s 2 final.m4a\n\nOn newest versions of afconvert:\nafconvert intermediate.caf -d aac -f m4af -ue pgcm 2 --soundcheck-read -b 256000 -q 127 -s 2 final.m4a\n\nFor XLD, I used these settings:\nFormat: MPEG-4 AAC\nMode: VBR (Constrained)\nEncoder Quality: Max\nSample Rate: Auto\nTarget bitrate: 256 kbps\nAdd gapless information for iTunes: checked\nWrite accurate bitrate information: checked\n\n\nA: You can use the \"Mastering For iTunes\" droplet available on apple's website. \nhttp://www.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/\nI did need to modify the script to run on Yosemite/ El Capitan, but it's fairly trivial:\n\n\n*\n\n*Show the package contents of the app in Finder (Applications/ Utilities/ Master for iTunes Droplet).  \n\n*Navigate to Contents/ Resources/ Scripts\n\n*Open main.scpt\n\n*Update system version compare lines to \"10.10\" (there are two lines that need this change): \n\n\nif systemVersion is less than \"10.10\" then\n\n\n*Save main.scpt\n\n\nNow you can simply drag and drop your FLAC or WAV files onto the droplet and it will create an intermediate CAFF file followed by the iTunes Plus AAC file.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFor those interested, it looks like the afconvert subroutines use the following commands (note these are pulled out of context of the code and will not run as-is):\n\n\n*\n\n*WAV/FLAC to CAFF:\n\n\n*\n\n*if the sampleRate is greater than \"44100\":\n\n\n\nafconvert -d LEF32@44100 -f caff --soundcheck-generate --src-complexity bats -r 127\n\n\n\n*\n\n*else\n\n\n\nafconvert -d 0 -f caff --soundcheck-generate\n\n\n*CAFF to AAC\n\nafconvert -d aac -f m4af -u pgcm 2  --soundcheck-read -b 256000 -q 127 -s 2\n\n", "Q: How to use the new iPad (3rd gen) as a second screen?

They issued a press release of some sort last week, many blogs covered this upcoming feature. They also covered this on their blog and how it will work.\nUpdate - it looks like this feature is now available in version 1.6. More on MacStories as well. \n\nA: Take a look at AirDisplay, which does exactly what you need:\n\nRetina and HiDPI support are coming very soon as per this blog post, which suggests the App is already in the review process:\n\n\"So, stay tuned.

It's been working absolutely flawlessly for me.\n\nA: Another option is Screen Recycler. Basically you set up Screen Recycler on your Mac and then you run a VNC app on your iPad which extends the desktop of your Mac. That means that any computer/tablet capable of running a VNC client would be compatible. (It was originally designed for an old Mac you no longer use.)\nTUAW has a short explanation of the app. There's a more in-depth tutorial here.\n", "Q: Does the iPad 3rd generation output 1080p video using the HDMI adaptor? I can play 1080p videos I've loaded onto the iPad using the video player on the iPad itself.  Before I invest in the HDMI adaptor, I'd like to know if the HDMI output actually displays 1080p on the external display, and shows the video at full resolution?\nI'm worried that either the output will be something lower (1080i, 720p) or that it may be 1080p output, but the video will be resolution reduced to 720p or 480p even though displayed on a 1080p device.\n\nA: It works at 1080p. As stated on the Apple web site:\n\nAirPlay video streaming to Apple TV (3rd generation) at up to 1080p and Apple TV (2nd generation) at up to 720p\nVideo mirroring and video out support: Up to 1080p with Apple Digital AV Adapter or Apple VGA Adapter (adapters sold separately)\n\nEnjoy your new iPad!\n", "Q: How to batch forward messages from Mail.app I get mail forwarded to my OS X Mail from an Outlook account at work. I use my Mac to reply to messages directly from Mail.app and now I want to forward all my sent mails from Mail to my Outlook account for filing.\nIs there any way to do this that's easier than individually forwarding all the messages manually? I want to keep all the messages separate.\n\nA: You can set Rules in Mail.app preferences to take actions on emails. What should work is a rule configured like this:\n\nYou would just need to fill in the to: field with the account that should be receiving all email.\nAnother option is to forward mail from the source. If the source is iCloud, you can Forward all messages automatically. If you use Gmail, Gmail can do it too.\n", "Q: What obsolete files can I remove from my iPhoto Library? I've been using iPhoto since many versions ago ... probably since version 1. In that time, the file structure of its iPhoto Library has changed a few times, and I suspect that some of the files in there now are no longer needed. I'd like to clean it up to save disk space. Do you know if the following are needed?\n\n\n*\n\n*The root level of the iPhoto Library contains some folders named after years, from 1998-2006. Each folder contains subfolders for months and days, and each day folder contains a data folder and then two numbered files, one with no extension and one with the .attr extension. These files are only about half a kilobyte in size and appear to contain metadata only. It looks like a version upgrade in 2006 made these obsolete since they're all older than that.\n\n*A Caches folder contains two files with long alphanumeric names, last modified in 2009.\n\n*A Contents folder contains a PkgInfo file, last modified in 2008.\n\n*An Auto Import folder is empty, last modified in 2008.\n\n*A Dir.data file, last modified in 2008.\n\n*Files named Library.data, Library.iPhoto, Library6.iPhoto and Library6.iPhoto.back, last modified in 2009.\n\n*A ThemeCache file, last modified in 2010.\n\n\nIt seems pretty clear these are no longer used; I could always delete them and find out, since I have a backup. But maybe someone who started using iPhoto after 2009 can tell me if any of these files are in their library?\n\nA: It is a bad idea to try to manually modify the folder structure inside the iPhoto library, as you seem to want to do.\nThe best way is to follow Apple's instructions for rebuilding the iPhoto library.\nHowever, this is usually only used as a repair procedure if iPhoto is malfunctioning.\nYou can try this, but make sure you have a complete backup of your iPhoto library before you start the rebuilding procedure.\nAlso, realize that iPhoto has an internal Trash that is separate from Mac OS X's Trash. If you have deleted hundreds of photos over the years, and never emptied the iPhoto Trash, those photos will still be in there and taking up space in the file structure.\n\nA: I quit iPhoto, deleted all the files and folders I listed above, and restarted iPhoto. After browsing through a bunch of old photos and albums, I don't see any problems. I'll keep my backup for a while, and post back here if I see any problems later.\n", "Q: How to watch an iPhone rental on a Mac? I foolishly forgot that renting a movie on an iPhone meant you had to watch it on that phone.\nIs there anyway to just watch it on a Mac (which is authorised on the same Apple ID)? Not neccessarily to transfer it?\nI have airserver app on my Mac, but when I try AirPlaying it to the Mac, it opens a window that looks like QuickTime (but isn't), and says Can't play Content not authorized.\nOr is it possible to delete it from my phone and redownload it on my Mac without paying again?\n\nA: Do not delete the download or you will lose the rental.\nThe only method for transferring rentals is between two devices is when you start by renting it from a computer. This is detailed at the end of a quite large knowledge base article under the section worded Can I play my rental on more than one device?.\n\nIf you download a rented movie on your iPhone 4 or later, iPad, iPod\n  touch (4th generation or later), or Apple TV: It is not transferable\n  to any other device or computer.\n\nYou can get help from Apple to accomplish this move if you are not certain if your software is the correct version or are having difficulties with your account. They might issue a one time refund, but this isn't intended to be something you can regularly do. If you have a TV and an Apple TV, your best alternative might be to AirPlay the movie, but on Lion, you will need third party software like AirServer to get video and music from your iOS device (your phone in this case) to play on the mac. Please research this option well (especially the returns policy before buying), since it says it plays videos and it may not work with protected content like a movie rental.\n\nA: No, AirServer, AirPlayer, or another of the dozens of applications that turn your mac into an airplay server won't work due to missing content protection.  If you had an apple tv you'd probably be able to use airplay for that.\nSince that doesn't work, then your next best bet is probably to use the HDMI AV adapter kit to watch on a tv or monitor.  You won't be able to use the VGA adapter as it doesn't feature content protection, but the HDMI adaptor to a new TV or monitor should be fine.\n", "Q: How to connect two non-Thunderbolt displays to the Macbook Pro 2011 via Thunderbolt? I have the VGA and HDMI adapters for my Macbook Pro 2011, but can only connect one display at a time - neither adapter has a female Thunderbolt connector to act as a passthrough.\nMy understanding is that I can use two Apple Thunderbolt displays by daisy chaining them and have three displays - the native notebook display, and two Thunderbolt displays - at once.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to connect two non-Thunderbolt displays to the laptop, via a splitter, or some sort of Thunderbolt cable or adapter?\n\n*If I buy one Thunderbolt display, can I then use the VGA or HDMI Thunderbolt adapter daisy-chained off that display to drive a non-Thunderbolt display and have three monitors that way?\n\nA: There are cheap DisplayPort to HDMI splitters, all based on the IDT ViewXpand chipset. You do not get full control over your monitors, mind you, to the OS it's just one huge monitor. But, did I mention it's cheap? http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=101&cp_id=10114&cs_id=1011409&p_id=8117&seq=1&format=2 or http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812500002 . I plan to drive a T221 from the two DisplayPorts on the 2012 MacBook Pro. 14 megapixels from a 2kg one laptop, that'd be something :D\nEdit: to clarify, this is a hack. This is not a MultiStreamHub for DisplayPort.\n\nA: This MacRumors article notes:\n\nApple's notes one other caveat about the Thunderbolt display: older\n  Mini DisplayPort displays won't light up if they're hooked directly\n  into the Thunderbolt port on the newer LCD. Macworld's testing found\n  that Mini DisplayPort LCDs can be added to a Thunderbolt chain and\n  work as normal by hooking them into another Thunderbolt peripheral.\n  It's unclear why simply hooking the older monitors directly into the\n  newer ones doesn't work. For best performance Apple recommends hooking\n  the Thunderbolt display directly into the Mac's port, then hooking\n  Thunderbolt storage devices into the display's relevant port.\n\nFrom Apple Support's KB:\n\nMini DisplayPort displays will not light up if connected to the\n  Thunderbolt port of an Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-inch). Displays\n  connected via Mini DisplayPort video adapter to the Thunderbolt port\n  of an Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-inch) will not work. Connect Mini\n  DisplayPort displays directly to a Thunderbolt port on a\n  Thunderbolt-capable Mac or to a compatible Thunderbolt peripheral.\n  If the Mini DisplayPort display is connected to a Thunderbolt peripheral, the display should be connected at the end of the\n  Thunderbolt chain.\n\nFrom another Apple Support KB:\n\nConnect Mini DisplayPort displays directly to a Thunderbolt port on a\n  Mac or to a compatible Thunderbolt peripheral; do not connect a Mini\n  DisplayPort display to a Thunderbolt display. Use only one Mini\n  DisplayPort device in a Thunderbolt chain. You cannot use a Mini\n  DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable to connect an iMac (Mid 2011) in\n  Target Display Mode to a Thunderbolt chain. See iMac (Mid 2011):\n  Target Display Mode does not work with Mini DisplayPort cable for more\n  information.\n\nI don't have the right hardware to test this setup, but the article/KBs above imply that driving multiple monitors may be possible, depending on your MBP model (see this KB for more details) regarding the number of monitors that are supported. Some MBPs with integrated graphics can only support one Thunderbolt monitor, which may preclude three monitors from being used together.\n\nA: The Apple mini-DisplayPort to VGA or HDMI adapter terminates the Thunderbolt chain where it is connected, so until Apple released new MacBook Pro with two Thunderbolt ports (similar to the iMac that has two ports) then you will only get one video signal from the device through the Thunderbolt port.\nYou may find an inexpensive USB to VGA solution to get around this limitation. Initially they were slower, but the newer ones are getting much faster and the software much better. You can then put the most important content on the Thunderbolt port and have the secondary display served over USB.\nShould a Thunderbolt adapter come about that drives two displays, I'll update the answer, but nothing has been released (or even rumored) even though it's clearly something the protocol could support.\nI like this knowledge base article for the clear deprecation of which Macs support two Thunderbolt displays and which ones only support one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-inch): Connection options for Thunderbolt Macs\n\nA: This question from July 2011 came to the conclusion that there wasn't a display splitter available yet and it seems there still isn't as far as I can search.\nMy feeling is that it's going to be an expensive device when or if it appears - probably more along the lines of a Thunderbolt-connected video upgrade (because Thunderbolt allows PCIe bus extension it may be a chassis allowing use of an off-the-shelf video card with dual outputs) rather than a simple adapter like the current DVI or HDMI adapters. Expect more products like this to appear. \nThis is one potential way to get two displays - if the software issues are solved, the product page says it does not currently work pending support from Apple - but I don't know what it might cost!\n\nA: Go for the PSE-DP4196.\nLooks like a winner!\n\nA: I searched hard to find something that will enable me to use 2 displays from my 2012 MacBook Pro without sacrificing on a USB port (by using an external graphics card)\nMy search ended here.\nBasically this beauty enables me to plugin into the thunderbolt port (which also take Mini display ports) and connect 2 x 24 inch monitors using HDMI AND also use my MacBook Pro display.\nSo in total I have 3 displays all running at the same time.\nWhat this adapter does is create an external display spanned across 2 monitors, which I have no problem with as i can resize my application windows accordingly.\nAnd plus you get lovely HDMI resolution.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: OK, I've been doing a bit of research on this topic myself.  What I'd really like to see, obviously, is a thunderbolt hub or splitter, etc.  There appears to be none, although I haven't seen anything saying that technically its not possible.\nThat said, I have 3 external monitors hooked up to my mac air (mid-2013) as follows:\nMy main monitor that I use all the time - Hooked up to the thunderbolt port.\nMy other two monitors - which are used more for reviewing documents, etc. - Are connected to a Diamond USB 3.0 Dual Head Display adaptor Model DV100 (it took me a little while to find drivers for this for the MAC, but they are out there).  This is a USB -> 2 monitor solution (it has two ports - one DVI and the other HDMI).\nThe resolution I get is:\nMain monitor - Asus VE278 - on Thunderbolt:  1080P\nSecond and third monitors - on Diamond device - Dell 2009W :  1680 x 1050\nThis is the resolution I was able to get on all three monitors when they were connected individually, so I believe I am not losing anything there.  \nIssues:\n1.  Every time I reboot they default back to being mirrored.  I have to hit Command F1 which puts them into extended display.  Occasionally, I also have to go to display settings and rearrange them. An apple tech told me this is true of USB type devices, as Apple first loads the display settings, then the USB ones.  So, when the USB settings are loaded, its too late to set the monitors the way they last were.  This is annoying, but I'm getting used to it.\n\n\n*As with any USB connector, the monitors refresh rate is a bit slow.  With my particular setup, I don't notice this.  Any videos I play are on my main monitor (on the thunderbolt cable), which works fine.  If I were to try to play a movie on the other USB ones, it would be either very choppy, or would not play at all.  that said, the other monitors are fine for reading email, typing documents, etc.  For that purpose, they are fine.  \n\n\nAs a side note, my monitors happen to have USB ports plugged into them.  So, the cabling is actually pretty funny:\nComputer USB port -> Monitor 1\nMonitor 1 USB #1 -> Diamond device \nDiamond device (HDMI) -> Monitor 1\nDiamond device (DVI) -> Monitor 2\nMonitor 1 USB #2 -> Monitor 2 USB input\nThis leaves 1 USB port free on my computer, which goes to a USB hub.  It also leaves several USB ports available on my monitors, which I am using most of...\nI know this isn't really the direction you were trying to go, but hope it helps.\n\nA: This answer may be a little late but StarTech released a thunderbolt 2 dock that has two separate displayport connectors allowing you to connect two non-thunderbolt monitors via one thunderbolt port. It is backwards compatible with thunderbolt 1 and even on thunderbolt 1 you should be able to get two monitors at a maximum of 2560x1440 (if not 2560x1600) connected at the same time.  It is a bit expensive at $347.99 though. https://www.startech.com/Cards-Adapters/Laptop-docking-stations/thunderbolt-2-laptop-dock~TB2DOCK4K2DP\n\nA: You can by interface miniDP -> DVI and switcher\nYou can find cheaper but they won't support 2560x1600px resolution on each monitor.\n\nA: I have done this with using a thunderbolt port to VGA and USB to VGA set up. The USB to VGA set up was achieved using a DIGITECH XC4879 USB to VGA converter. It needed drivers downloaded from the web but it works fine. The OS recognises Three Separate monitors and they can extended or mirrored.\nThe adaptor also works fine via a powered USB hub.\nMac 2.3ghz corei7 OSX 10.9.5.\n", "Q: My Notes app accidentally got deleted from my iPhone 4s and I cannot locate it in the app list in iTunes when I synch. Any ideas? I accidentally deleted the Notes app and cannot find it (although when I do a spotlight search it does come up).  Any ideas how I restore it to my screen?  Thanks!\n\nA: It sounds like it's not deleted, but just off of the screen. I've had this happen to a few of my apps. What I always do to fix it is go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Home Screen Layout. You'll get your Notes app back, but your Home Screen will be arranged into alphabetical order, and unless you're JailBroken, this is pretty much the only way to get it back without restoring.\n\nA: It's not possible to delete it, as it is one of the built-in apps that you cannot remove.  You can, however, move it somewhere daft.  If you check in your app folders, and do the press-and-hold to move jiggle, it should show up somewhere, possibly on the mystery last screen.\nYou aren't close to the app limit by any chance are you?\n\nA: This happened to me today. The solution for me was simple. \nLook carefully in each of your folders amoung your Apps.  It is possible that you moved it by mistake into one of them. \n\nA: Have you tried restoring your iPhone?\nSee http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1414 for the details on how to do this.\n", "Q: How do I hide an icon? I just saw this question and answer:\nMy Notes app accidentally got deleted from my iPhone 4s...\nSo apparently it's possible to erroneously hide system icons.  How can I do this?  I'm sick of the Weather and Stock icons taking up space.  My iPhone 4 with iOS 5.1 isn't jail broken.\n\nA: You can't hide them except by putting them away in a folder - I keep one called \"useless\" just for stuff like the stock calculator, weather, stock apps - wish I could delete them without jail breaking.\nA folder is easily created by tapping and holding an icon until they start to shake, then dragging one icon on top of another. The lower icon will take on a border and if the icon is released both are placed inside the newly created folder.\nThere is at least one icon that cannot be hidden in this way, the Newsstand icon. It can be repositioned but will not create (see above) or allow itself to be put inside a folder. It is the only icon I know of so far with this special behaviour.\n\nA: According to my understanding, this bug has since been removed from iOS 4+, but I'll tell you how to do it anyway. Other than this bug, I don't know of any others, except for one that has no replication steps (iOS just randomly hides apps, and they usually return after a reboot). You're welcome to try this, though.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fill all 11 pages on your home screen with apps (that's 180 total apps).\n\n*Install one more app.\n\n*Your new app will be hidden.\n\n*There may or may not be a 12th page that you can use while in edit mode (I just tried on iOS 5.0.1, and it didn't have one). If there is, you can put any apps that you want hidden here (as long as there are already 180 apps).\n\n*You could also do this with folders on iOS 4 (you would create a folder with multiple apps, and then start taking everything out of the folder and the last one would split from the folder and hide).\n\n\nIt's difficult to get the apps to go where you want and which ones you want hidden, but the more you play around with it, the more you'll be in control.\nLike I said, this has been fixed, but you might be able to find another similar way. If you'd like to JailBreak, though, SBSettings is a great tweak that allows you to easily hide applications on your Home Screen.\n\nA: I believe this is a bug with the software, and therefore might not be easy to reproduce. If it was common and easy to reproduce, I would guess that Apple would have patched it up by now. However, it may be related to a similar problem that was prevalent in earlier OSs...\nThere was originally a bigger problem in earlier versions of the OS when there was a lower limit to the amount of apps you could install. Once you installed too many, they would disappear. Since then, Apple added folders and more home screens making it much harder to reach the limit now.\nOn one of the earlier OSs (I believe it was iOS 2.something), you could repeat this by moving apps to the hidden 10th screen. Basically, you would fill up the 9th screen (the last one available at the time), and then begin pushing apps to the 10th screen. Once you were done editing, they would no longer be available.\nI believe this is a bug with the software, and therefore might not be easy to reproduce. \n", "Q: Is there a way to see the time that a photo was taken on the iPhone? Sometimes I took a photo using my iPhone, and then later on, I wonder how long I have been there at that location, I thought of checking when the last photo was taken, and can tell the time when I arrived, but I found it wasn't easily possible to see what time the photo was taken.\nIs there really a way to see the time that photo was taken, be it 1 hour and 20 minutes ago, without using any third party app and without importing the photo to a computer?  I thought this might be a simple photo info thing that might be invoked by some easy way?\n\nA: You are not missing anything, the iPhone has no mechanism to see that information natively. However, if you search for EXIF on the App Store, there are a few (some free) apps that will happily do that in the device itself. \nYou must note that, due to the way iTunes work, pictures coming from iTunes will not have their metadata associated. Sad but true.\n\nA: Yes - the old mobile iPhoto app as well as the Photos app shows all sorts of photo metadata (assuming you allowed the camera app to store it in the first place) including the capture time.\n\nCamera roll and Photo stream are part of the Library, so you should be good to go. You can get the above screen by tapping the i with the rectangle to bring up the information for photos stored in the library.\n\nIn the case of time, even if you deny location services, it should have the timestamp based on the file's creation date/time.\n\nA: To view the EXIF data (time taken, GPS coordinates, and other values) of your photos on the iPhone you will need a 3'rd party application. I could only find these two on the app store:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exif & IPTC Metadata Browser\n\n*Exif Wizard\n\nA: You can do this with the built in Photos app. Open the photo and observe the date and time shown in the navigation bar at the top. This only works if you hold the phone in portrait mode (vertical)!\n    \n\nA: iPhoto for iPhone will also show you this along with many other details about the photo (ISO, shutter speed, etc) if you prefer to stick with Apple written applications.\nI have started to use iPhoto as a replacement for Photos on my iPhone!\n\nA: As on iOS 11.0 or later, You can view time stamp of photo within Apple's Photos App without Third party Apps.\nNote that, if it doesn't display the Year, that photo was shot on same year.\nBut it doesn't display \"seconds\" field in time stamp, so if you need that level of details, checkout Third party \"EXIF\" apps on Appstore, like \"EXIF Viewer by Fluntro\"\n\n\nScreenshot using EXIF Viewer by Fluntro.\n\nDisclaimer: I have developed the EXIF Viewer by Fluntro App :)\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/exif-viewer-by-fluntro/id944118456?mt=8\nTo know more features about the app, checkout\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycz0b0uDn9A\n\nA: The free app Camera Awesome allows you to see when a photo was taken.\nOpen the app and go to the camera roll. Tap the plus button and import the photo you want to view date information for. Select that photo and tap the (i) button. The date and time the photo was taken will be displayed, as well as lots of other useful details.\n\n\nA: If you want to see what time it was taken without an app, you could simply open the image on a computer using a notepad program of some sort. The time and date will often be within the first few lines of code.\n\nA: Rotate your iPhone. The built-in Photos app shows the date and time the photo was taken in the navigation bar at the top, but only in portrait orientation.\n\nA: Instead of looking on App Store for EXIF, also search for term 'metadata'... there is a free app named 'Photo Metadata Viewer' from Boxo (??) that dumps this info to screen for fairly easy reading. NOT fancy, but free.\n\nA: Some other camera apps give access to EXIF data. Camera+, for example, has an info button in its lightbox picture-viewer which shows EXIF data and even shows a map detailing where that picture was taken.  \nNote this is helpful even if you're looking for EXIF data in photos taken with standard iOS photo services, embedded in some other app, as Camera+ can import images from the iPhone's standard Camera Roll.  \n(I have no connection to Camera+ except as a satisfied user)\n\nA: There are probably other apps, but ProCamera has this ability.\n\n\nA: A free, lightweight app for this is Exif Wizard (size 0.2 MB).\nIf you only want to access the timestamp or other Exif data, it makes more sense to install Exif Wizard instead of e.g. Camera Awesome (18.1 MB) or ProCamera (17.4 MB).\n\n\nA: Another third party solution (of which I feel obliged to confess I created) is Photo Timestamps. It's an elegant solution to this problem- it displays your photos in a 3 photo grid with the timestamp displayed over the photo's thumbnail\n\nA: We just released a new app that makes it easy to sort, organize and share your iOS photos by date and location.\nPhotowerks scans your camera roll and displays your photos similarly to the Apple Photos app, but groups them by date taken or photo location.  \nFeatures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quickly sort photos by date taken, city, state, country, camera make, or camera model.\n\n*View photos in a grid or list view.\n\n*Tap photo to view date taken and location (city, state)\n\n*Share photos via email, Facebook, Twitter (with photo captions listing photo date and location)\n\n*Create new albums in the Apple Photos app.\n\n*View photo details with standard pinch to zoom gestures and swipe to view previous/next photo.\n\n\nThe app is USD $0.99 on the App Store.\n\nA: Photo Timestamps is a third party app that provides this information. It's not free, but it's also not $4.99. It's got a really clean, minimal interface (obligatory disclosure: I made it).\n\nA: Since this took me awhile to find and a few of the apps here are old I thought I would share several iphone date viewing apps. \nThe ones I have tried: \nExif Wizard\nGood app that I have used for about 2 years. Nothing fancy it just lets you view the metadata. It is only 0.4 MB. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/exif-wizard/id387652357?mt=8\nKoredoko - Exif and GPS Viewer\nGood app that I have used for about 2 years.

Bear in mind this is from 2005 but I see very similar behaviour to what is described here.\nThe standout image for me is this one:\n\nIt shows pretty clearly that shuffle does use rating in determining which song to play. I find it strange that mid-rated songs are much more likely to be played than high-rated songs.\nAskDifferent user Ian C. did some interesting experiments last year and found that the appearing non-randomness of shuffle is probably due to the algorithm re-using the seed rather than being completely random.\nThe meaning of this is that shuffle is not truly random, only pseudorandom. As this Random Seed article (Wikipedia) explains, having the seed used in a pseudorandom process will allow you to recreate the same \"random\" results. True randomness is actually very, very hard to get. (While working on a mobile phone at Siemens years ago a doctor of mathematics had to be brought in to write the random function - the ordinary programmers weren't considered qualified, and the C library function considered inadequate.)\n", "Q: Can Safari on an iPad be controlled with gestures? On the Desktop version of Safari, you can navigate back and forward with a swipe gesture on the trackpad. Setting up other gestures (close tab, new tab, next/previous tab) is trivial with an app like BetterTouchTool.\nI find myself trying to use these gestures, especially the swipes for back and forward, on my iPad (third generation).\nIs there any way to enable gestures for Safari on the iPad?\nI realize that the answer is probably no; Apple isn't much for hidden features/preferences in iOS and there are no BTT equivalents. So, I'm willing to explore alternatives. Are there any other web browsers for iPad, preferably as similar to Safari as possible, that support gestures?\n\nA: Yes - Dolphin Browser supports gestures. So do Atomic Web Browser and Perfect Web Browser.\nAs you correctly realised the answer is no for Safari, unless you count the four-finger swipe up to get to the current app list, and other system gestures.\n\nA: There are a few Cydia packages which modify Safari to enable gestures and fullscreen mode. I have used \"Fullscreen for Safari\" which kind of works but is buggy with the debug console enabled (and the swipes are also buggy) on my iPad3. \nI have also tried \"Swipe Safari\" now and it is far superior to the other one, though I think it costs more. It gives you a lot of options in terms of gestures (one, two, three finger swipes, pulling, multi taps, tap and hold)\n\nA: Safari for iPad does not support multi-touch gestures beyond those you mention, and there is no additional way to configure it to do so.\nIt looks like the following browsers offer muti-touch gestures, and might fit your needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perfect Web Browser\n\n*Atomic Web Browser\n\n*Dolphin Web Browser\n\nA: only way to get gestures, download manager and other cool thinks on you iOS safari is by jailbreaking. \nthese are the tweaks which will do a magic for you\n-sleipinzer for safari\n-swipesafari\n-fullscreen safari\n-safari download manager\n", "Q: Increase font size in OS I have a 17-inche Macbook-pro, the resolution is at the moment 1920x1200, the font size of the system looks very small. Is there a way to increase the font size without changing the resolution? It seems that we can't parameter it via System Preferences...\nPS: the OS is Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C2002)\n\nA: See this answer - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/45719/11118\nBasically you enable a higher-resolution mode where everything uses twice as many pixels, so things appear bigger.\n\nA: Higher resolution is not a good choice for a permanent default because you lose the benefit of the larger screen.\nInstead, go to Settings > Accessibility > Zoom\nIf you are using a trackpad, choose \"Use scroll gesture with modifier keys …\" This enables you to use the two finger swipe to enlarge the entire screen, including menus.  Make sure to adjust how you want the window to move so you can see what is off-screen using \"More Options\" - I prefer \"only when the pointer reaches an edge\" to ensure a smooth, slow scroll sideways or up/down, but there are other choices. \nIf you don't have a trackpad, you can also set accessibility options for mouse gestures or keyboard control.\nWhen you need, zoom the entire screen - which will include menus. Once you have finished with whatever system level task you are doing, simply zoom back down.  \nRemember that you can set the \"view options\" for system level windows, which currently allows you to increase the font to 16 and increase the size of the icons. If you are brave enough, there are also ways to modify the preferences through terminal to change this default size, but so far I have found none that will change the main menus.\nFor non-system windows, i.e., application windows such as browser pages or documents, you can zoom with a pinch (if you have a trackpad) or set the accessibility options you prefer.\nIf this is an issue for you, I highly recommend getting a trackpad, as I did for my father, because many gestures for zoom can be completed on the fly with little disruption to your usability.\n\nA: Another alternative (which is not system nor app wide) is to customize your tool bar. Under the menu view, right click or two finger tap on the tool bar, select customize tool bar, add the little A and Big A to your tool bar this will allow one to enlarge or decrease the element inside the running program. Press big A to enlarge and little A to decrease.\nThe keystroke is command (apple) + or _ when zoom is enabled.\n\nA: Set up an alias:\nalias bigxter='xterm -font lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24'\n\nThen put that alias in your .bashrc, so that after you log in, you can type bigxter and your easily visible font xterm window will pop up!  Maybe put one or two of those windows as default to logging in as well so you have enough windows to work in.\n", "Q: How to translate between Windows and Mac -style file locations?

It's not always sunny and 73° where I live. Is there any Weather forecasting app for iOS which will change its icon to show current conditions? Or even a way to make the standard Weather.app behave like this?\n\nA: There are two apps, Celsius and Fahrenheit, that I know of that will add badges to their icons to attempt to give you an up-to-date temperature at a glance. I say attempt because the badge approach doesn't support negative numbers so if your temperature dips below zero for either of those two scales you won't know.\nBut without jailbreaking your phone that's as good as it gets. The App guidelines from Apple don't let third party apps change their icons.\n\nA: Official 3rd party apps are not authorized to change the icon in iOS see this question.\nSo there is no solution there. The only feature you could get from an official app would be a badge displaying the temperature.\nYou could look at the cydia store if you have or want to jailbreak your phone.\n\nA: You're looking for Pocket Weather World or Pocket Weather World HD by awesome Australian developers Shifty Jelly. It will display the current temperature (for your most recently-viewed location) as a badge on the icon. \nIf you're in Australia look for the local versions (i.e. Pocket Weather AU HD which offer better integration with the Bureau of Meteorology's radar services etc.\n(iOS icons can't change dynamically, the badge is the best they can do so far)\n", "Q: Virtual machines to install for OS+Ubuntu+Windows I have a MacBook Pro running OS X Lion 10.7.2, and I am going to install VMware to run virtual Windows.\nI would like to use Ubuntu at the same time; is it technically possible? Do I need to install another virtual machine for that? In this case, which virtual machine is a best choice?\nSo ideally, I would like to use OS+Ubuntu+Windows, with a shared folder. Is it possible to adjust frequently the memory that a machine occupies?\nPS: some info of my hardware:\nProcessor: 2.5GHz Intel Core i7\nMemory: 8GB 1333 MHz DDR3\n\nA: Yes it's possible. You don't need to install multiple virtualization software to run multiple virtualized systems.\nYou can use one virtualization software (VMware, Parallels or VirtualBox for example) to run multiple virtual machines at the same time.\nYou can edit the Virtual Machines. \n\nYou can change the amount of memory and the number of cores used by each virtual machine among other things, but it requires shutting down the VM you will edit.\n\nFor non Bootcamp virtual machines, you can also change the settings of virtual hard drives by creating new drives, removing existing ones or even resizing existing virtual hard drives (which are just files on your hard drive).\n\n\nGetting the best of both worlds.\nI would recommend you install Windows in Bootcamp first. Then back in Mac OS you create your Windows virtual machine from the bootcamp install. Follow this procedure.\nThis way you will be able to either launch Windows from Mac OS and run both systems at the same time and restart your computer to boot into Windows natively for better performance (for video games or power hungry applications).\n", "Q: Is it possible to drag the Dock around the screen? As a Windows/Mac/Ubuntu/Fedora user, I have seen many different ways to manage windows. Some of these, like the Windows taskbar and the OS X Dock, are very interesting and highly useful.\nOne feature that the Windows 7 taskbar has is the ability to drag it around the screen to snap it left, top, right, or down. This is very fun and also practical in many instances.\nI've come to like this feature so much that I accidentally did this in Lion - but nothing happened. \nIs it possible to drag the Dock around the screen?

The dock will snap to the left, bottom, or right side of the screen as you drag it.\n\n", "Q: Does an iPad consume more battery power when there are multiple applications open? Does an iPad consume more battery power when there are multiple applications open compared to let's say, having only one application resident in memory? \nIf there are differences between the different versions of iPad, then I am specifically looking for the answer for the new iPad. \n\nA: No. Only one app truly runs on iOS at a time. \nYes, there are some seconds an app can ask to finish a task before the OS will kill the process if it's not done. \nYou can have some background tasks like a Skype phone call going in the background, but again this is really the iOS running that specialized code for the app, not the entire app still running. \nOther than the edge case, where you exit one app and it has a few seconds to finish up tasks, only one app runs at a time on iOS and your battery life isn't affected by multiple apps. Your battery gets drained due to the foreground app and/or the OS itself doing radio, lighting the screen and running the CPU. \n\nA: Short answer:\nIn the best case, the amount of resources consumed by multiple apps will be the same as when you are running a single app. In the worst case, multiple apps will consume more resources than a single app. Therefore, to stay on the safe side, you should close all background apps.\n\nLong answer:\nAn iOS device consumes more (or the same amount of) resources when there are multiple applications running. Let S be the amount of resources consumed with a Single app running, and M be the amount of resources consumed with Multiple apps running. We have the following relationship: S <= M, and closing apps will keep you on the safe side.\nAlthough Apple's intent was for users to not have to worry about background apps, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is that way. The fact is that developers have the freedom to implement apps as they please, and once Apple opened up the App Store to any developer in the world, all bets of Apple's intent were off. Although developers technically only have 5 background profiles to choose from, there are several ways in which Apps may undesirably consume resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unwanted background behavior: E.g. A user uses Skype for IM only, and doesn't quit the app after the IM session is done. The app is listening to VOIP even though the user is not using it for that reason.\n\n*Unknown background behavior: Imagine an app which helps remind you where you parked by using your GPS. Is it using Apple's GPS background process, or is it using some other feature? Or how about a podcast app which is playing a podcast that is in the process of being downloaded. Will it automatically remove itself from the background once it no longer needs to download the podcast?\n\n*User error: A user is running a radio application and uses the pause feature rather than stop feature, which causes the app to continuously consume resources, but, since the music is no longer playing, has no indication that it is doing so.\n\n*Application error: A radio app which gets indefinitely paused in the background, e.g. due to a poor connection. The user has no indication that the app is running and consuming up resources. Even this article which argues the opposite case mentions that there are apps that can go \"berserk and will not terminate properly.\"\n\n*Undocumented features. There have been cases where apps pass the review process even though they contain features Apple doesn't allow (e.g. tethering). It's not farfetched to imagine a developer hiding a background process in their app as well. It could easily be masked if some portion of the application actually utilizes the documented background processing feature, while the rest does whatever it pleases once it's running in the background. The main reason tethering apps are removed from the App Store is because of the publicity they generate. An application that uses background processing for undocumented reasons would be able to fly under Apple's radar for many years, since no one would necessarily know about these features, let alone care enough to discuss them on the Internet.\n\n\nWith over 500,000 apps on the App Store, there is no way to know what each application does, let alone know what kind of background process it may be running, and whether or not it is well-written.\nThis is the same reason an Apple Genius would recommend that you close all the apps in the tray. No one is arguing that all of those apps are running and consuming resources. They're arguing that some of those apps may be consuming resources, and since there is no  way to know which of them are using up resources, since the icons look the same, the easiest way to solve this issue is to close all of them.\nTechnically, you could go through the list and ignore all those apps which you know for sure don't use background processing, but that is a far more challenging task than simply closing all of them. (Here's an example which although is exaggerated could still be real: This is a turn-by-turn GPS app, so I need to shut it off; this is a radio app, but I never pressed the play button, so it shouldn't be streaming in the background; this is a GPS app which doesn't use turn-by-turn, so I don't need to close it;  this is an app which might be downloading something I don't care about, and I closed it 6 minutes ago, so it might be in the 10 minute window of bg processing, and I should close it; this is just a game, so I don't need to worry about it; this is a parking app which uses my location, did the developer implement it as a GPS app or does the GPS only work when I launch it?) Compare that with: close, close, close, ...\nAs the number of apps you have installed on your iPhone increase, so does the likelihood of having background processes consuming undesirable resources.\nYou can't expect a user to know how every app they download will behave. Therefore, if a user is concerned with unnecessary background processing, then closing apps is a good idea.\n\nThere have been many times when I would notice my iPhone getting really hot even when I'm not using it. The cause is always some application(s) which is using the processor even though it's not necessarily running in the foreground. The quick fix is to close all the applications (by double tapping the home button). So far this has always resolved my iPhone's overheating issues within a few minutes.\n\nA: Under normal circumstances only one application is in the foreground and actually running. Of course what that app is doing can have a big effect on battery life.\nOther applications may be multitasking, but only in very specific circumstances - it's rare. Most apps will actually be doing nothing, so the answer is  conditionally, \"no\".\nWhen you tap the home button the foreground app receives a set of messages that allow it to prepare for and then enter a background mode. The app doesn't have to terminate completely but it is not running either. By default apps may not continue running in the background in iOS. They may request permission to run for up to ten minutes in the background (for example to complete a download) when they are notified that they are about to lose foreground status. Abusing this would be one way to get an app rejected by Apple.\nFraser Speirs recently wrote a very interesting blog post about this which was widely retweeted by developers, because it is right, and current for iOS 5.x.\nQuoting from it:\n\nThere are exactly five kinds of apps allowed to run indefinitely in the Background state in iOS 5:\n\n*\n\n*Apps that play audio while in the Background state. A good example is\nInstacast while it's playing a podcast.\n\n*Apps that track your location in the Background. For example, you\nstill want voice prompts from your TomTom navigation app, even if\nanother app is Active.\n\n*Apps that listen for incoming VOIP calls. If you use Skype on iOS,\nyou can receive incoming Skype calls while the app is in the\nBackground.\n\n*Newsstand apps that are downloading new content.\n\n*Apps that receive continuous updates from an external accessory in\nthe Background.\n\n\nNow if you are running an app that fits into one of the above categories it could be performing background processing. If it is a badly written app it could possibly be doing unnecessary processing. If at the same time you were running a foreground app that is demanding of processing resources then it's possible that killing the background app could make your foreground app go faster.\nHowever! If you look at the categories you will see that these are all things that you would want to do if you were using those apps. You would not want to be able to receive a Skype call only when you brought Skype to the foreground. You would not want TomTom to stop giving you directions just because your passenger started to check email. So terminating apps is almost always a bad idea.\nNow a word about the Recent Apps List that you bring up by double-clicking the home button. Notice the name is not \"task list\" or \"multitasking list\" or anything like that - it's just a list of recent apps. Some of them may be in the background, suspended and ready to run. Some may be terminated and not running at all - if tapped they would have to start running from scratch. An app from one of the listed categories may even be running in the background. But this list gives no indication of what is running right now. You can remove apps from the list but if the app wasn't running it can't be terminated. Proof: do a hard reset of your phone, letting it boot from the white apple screen. All the icons remain the same. Apps that may have been running are now not running but their icons remain.\nGenerally speaking there is no need to manually remove an application from the recent apps list.\nIf you really want to terminate an app that is currently in the foreground without switching to switch away from it before terminating it via the recent apps list, you can hold down the sleep/wake button (top of the device) until slide to power off appears. If you then hold down the home button until the device returns to the springboard, the app is terminated. (If you press Cancel and return to the app instead it is not terminated.) Proof: use an app with state - e.g. do a search in the iTunes Store app. Terminate it in this way, when you reopen the app your state is gone. If you don't terminate it your state remains.\nGenerally termination of the foreground app is never required - as you may have seen, an app that crashes is terminated by the phone automatically as soon as the watchdog process detects that the app is not responding to system events.\nFrom the iPhone OS 4 press event in 2010:\n    Q: How do you close applications when multitasking? \n    A: (Scott Forstall) You don't have to. The user just uses things and doesn't ever\n have to worry about it. \n    A: (Steve Jobs) It's like we said on the iPad, if you see a stylus, they blew it.\n In multitasking, if you see a task manager... they blew it. Users shouldn't ever have\n to think about it.\n\n\nA: I just found out that the multitasking apps DO run down your battery. I have a 3rd Gen. I-Pad and noticed it was not charging up like it should, wasn't sure why.  As of yesterday it suddenly hit 10 % and I panicked. Talked to a nice guy at Apple tech who had me pull  up the multitask bar and then physically close all the apps and I had a bunch -- had never  heard of this.  After an hour, the battery is now up to 30% and still climbing. So folks it DOES happen and the open apps of a variety of types are what causes it.   I am now closing them on my iPad and my husband's 1st Gen. iPad which does not seem to be affected -- its battery stays on 100% almost all of the time, but the newer one -- not.\n", "Q: Are OS X and PureDarwin binary-compatible Are OS X and PureDarwin binary-compatible?\nCan I run simple non-GUI app compiled for OS X on PureDarwin (or vice-versa)?\n(Darwin is the Open Source operating system from Apple that forms the basis for Mac OS X)\n\nA: Yes - as long as you do not rely on a library or other feature that is only available in OS X.\nThe Pure Darwin project is a continuation of the Open Darwin project which was founded by Apple and a non-profit organization called the Internet Systems Consortium. This effort came to an end on 25 July 2006.

The web is awash with information on connected displays, and which support it, don't support it, and stories of people who weren't warned that theirs don't support it, paid $15 for a movie, and are now screwed.\nBut for internal displays, I can find nothing. Apple's own Technical Specifications do not list HDCP support. Everymac.com has nothing. I was once able to play an HD iTunes movie on my Late 2008 MacBook Pro, but had to take a leap of faith that it supported HDCP. A StackOverflow answer indicates even a motivated developer couldn't make an app that determines whether a given Mac has HDCP support for its built-in display.\nIt seems the only way - not exaggerating here - is to buy some protected content from iTunes and hope it works.\n\nA: Basically every modern Mac with an embedded screen supports HDCP.\niTunes will play all copy protected HD content on all integrated displays (MacBooks and iMacs) but not on non HDCP displays.\nThis lets us deduct that the integrated displays are HDCP compliant or at least that Mac OS ignores the HDCP flag when playing protected HD content on the integrated screen.\nApparently you might get this strange error, which leads me to think that Mac OS simply bypasses the HDCP check when using integrated displays.\n", "Q: Mac OS and distributed compile Is there an alternative to distcc on Mac OS X Lion?\nApple recently removed distcc from Xcode.

I'm curious because I generally only do small apps.\n\nA: You might be out of luck on this one.

The '[' or ']' characters appear when you use the AltGr key.\nI would hate to be doing Objective C on a French keyboard!\nHome and End depend on context in Windows. If the text is editable, home goes to the beginning of the line and End to the end of the line. The Mac does this with Command-Right Arrow (End) and Command-Left Arrow (Home).\nWhen the document is not editable, Home goes to the beginning of the document and End to the end of the document in Windows. On a Mac, for Home you use Command-Up Arrow, and for End you use Command-Down Arrow.\n\nA: On the French keyboard on a Mac, whether a hardware keyboard or the French keyboard layout in software, I believe that you must hold down three keys simultaneously to generate the \"[\" and \"]\" characters.\nI cannot test this myself, not having a French hardware keyboard, but I believe the required sequence is:\nThe \"[\" is generated by typing Shift + Option + (\nand the \"]\" is generated by typing Shift + Option + ).\nHere is a diagram of the Apple Wireless Keyboard - French which you can purchase from Apple.\n\nThe Option key is Apple's name for the \"Alt\" key on a PC. It is located between the Ctrl key and the Command key, next to the space bar.\n\nA: In Canada, the 'french' keyboard is QWERTY.  It looks like this: \n\nTo answer your questions:\n[ is accessible via alt + 9\n] is accessible via alt + 0\nHome is accessible via  + <= (left arrow)\nEnd is accessible via  + => (right arrow)\n", "Q: Can I move the top menu bar? As a Windows/Fedora/Mac/Ubuntu user, the menubar at the top of the screen has always bugged me. It doesn't go away and you can't move it. I've tried dragging it away in vain several times. It would look so nice on the right, just like my taskbar.\nBut after experiencing success with asking other questions that I thought impossible, I decided to ask it here to see if anyone knows how. So, with no further ado:\nHow can I move the top menu bar in Mac OS X?\n\nA: You can not re-position the menu bar, but you can configure it to be hidden when idle by checking the option 'Automatically hide and show the menu bar' under the General tab of System Preferences. Screenshot provided for further clarification. \n\nA: The top menu bar is non-moveable since the first version of MacOS and later Mac OS X.\nYou can't move it (tho you can drag it to an external display if you have one). \n\nA: I think the only moving of the menu bar you can do is from monitor to monitor.\nSecondBar gives you, well, a second menu bar. It is draggable, so you could position it in the middle or bottom of your screen, but I can't get it to change orientations to go vertically on the right.\n\nA: As mentioned in other answers the menu bar can unfortunately not be moved. However  - as of El Capitan - it is possible to hide it!\nIt is in General | Appearance | Automatically hide and show the menu bar:\n\nNo top menu bar! \n\nI appreciate this additional vertical real estate as well as diminished visual distraction.\n\nA: You can't\nmove the menu bar to your application top. This is a designed function from the original desktop metaphor. This is providing both an ergonomic (it's faster to move to a fix location) and a security function (this area is protected,\nand thus can never get hidden).\nYou can\nmove your keyboard to the menu bar:\nctrl ^+F2\nand from there access any menu entry without touching the trackpad and faster than any mouse addict.\n\nA: You can by holding ⌘ Command while moving the icons but it would only work for the bars that were created by apple.\n", "Q: Can I turn off the screen with a keyboard shortcut? One of the first customizations I make in Windows is to install WinBubble, an awesome piece of software that lets me add an option the the right-click menu of the desktop: 'Turn Off Monitor.' It's really quite awesome.\nNow that I'm using Macs more and more, I want to know how to do this on a Mac. But instead of using the mouse (yes, I'm a keyboard guy), I want to use the keyboard.\nIs it possible for me to turn off the screen with a keyboard shortcut? I'm thinking AppleScript - but something simpler is definitely better.\n\nA: Yes - shift-ctrl-eject is the keyboard shortcut for this.\n\nA: Control+Shift+Power For current Mac keyboard layouts. Control+Shift+Eject works for older keyboard layouts that still include the Eject key.\nThis page explains some alternate solutions as well.\nAlso, if you have \"Require password after sleep or screen saver begins\" set to immediately in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy, it will ask you for your password after doing this.\n", "Q: Can I use Adblock/Adblock Plus to block ads in games that are not in a browser? Occasionally, there are apps that embed little chunks of the Internet. In most cases, this is a good thing. However, occasionally they are used to display ads.\nThis is annoying, especially if I've contributed to the development of the software. As a software developer that uses ads to make money, I know that I'd be fine with someone contributing via PayPal and deciding not to view the ads.\nThis is my situation with quite a few apps: I've contributed to their development and I don't want to be nagged with ads or otherwise. One, in particular, embeds a mini-browser to display ads. \nIs there any way I could block such ads using ABP or other OS X software?\n\nA: You are going to want to use a hosts file to block all ads in all games. First you're going to have to find the domain name of the server that the ads are coming from. You can use a number of programs to monitor network traffic for this step. My favorite is ettercap-ng, but you might prefer Little Snitch (if you want to do this on a per-app per-port basis, then Little Snitch will be just right for you without having to modify your hosts file). Once you've determined the domain of the ad server you're wishing to block, open up /etc/hosts in your favorite terminal text editor with sudo permissions (sudo nano /etc/hosts) (the file has no extension; it's simply named hosts). Add this line to the end of the file after replacing \"domain.com\" with the domain you're trying to block:\n127.0.0.1 domain.com\nThis will tell your Mac to loopback when it comes across \"domain.com\", thus returning nothing, which essentially gets rid of all ads from that server in every app/program/game on your Mac (keep adding more lines for each ad server, and make them all loopback to 127.0.0.1). This method will also work on JailBroken devices and Linux.\nIf you want to use my omnipotent hosts file that blocks nearly all ads (it was written primarily for my JailBroken iPod), knock yourself out by replacing yours with mine: http://ss.gy/u Mine works on both desktop computers and mobile devices in multiple countries/languages (primarily the United States and France).\n\nA: No, Adblock/Adblock Plus have to install in a browser. Any app that is not a supported browser from this list is not going to be able to make use of it.\nGlimmerBlocker is one attempt to block all ads for all applications. I haven't tried it though.\n", "Q: How can I copy a Playlist from one iTunes library to another? I have one iTunes instance (v10.6.0.40) a Windows 7 PC.  I'm having problems copying playlists from there to my Macbook Air's iTunes instance.  Here's what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Win7 machine, I right click the Playlist, choose Export, export it as a .m3u8 file, and save it in my Dropbox.\n\n*On the MBA, I grab the new playlist from the Dropbox, and drop it into the Mac's iTunes library.\n\n\nAfter that, instead of a list of songs from they Playlist, I just get this:\n\nWhich I guess means that the newly imported playlist is blank.  \nHow can I (successfully) copy playlists between two computers?\n\nA: Under the File menu, In the Library expanding list, you will find \"Export Playlist\".\nOn the receiving machine you would use \"Import Playlist\" found in the same menu.\nSeems like you have the right procedure (although I do not know for sure that drag and drop will work with the playlist...) but have you tried to export a .txt file - that's what I get when I export a playlist. If you have the option could you export it as txt, verify that the file contains a list of songs, then verify that it also contains a list of songs when you get it back from dropbox? You should at least be able to isolate where the list disappears.\n", "Q: How do I increase significant digits in Grapher? How do I increase the significant digits in Grapher? \n\nA: All the numbers settings can be found via Grapher → Preferences → Numbers.\n\nYou can set the “Notation” setting to “Engineering” to display numbers as 123,4568e3 (7 significant digits) instead of 1,2346e5 (5 significant digits).\nPerhaps the “Number of Decimals” setting is of interest, too.\n", "Q: An Automator workflow for extracting text as speech from PDF files I get PDFs to revise course content which I want to convert to MP3 files and take with me as spoken audio.\nAutomator offers 'text to speech' conversion and it's great. When I try and build a workflow around it, seemingly everything happens except what I need.\nI want, as a folder action:\n\n\n*\n\n*To extract the text from a PDF dropped on the relevant folder\n\n*To get this text turned into spoken audio\n\n*To provide details for iTunes\n\n*Import this into a playlist of my choosing\n\n\nI currently have variations on this sequence, which does not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract PDF Text, save\n\n*Convert text to Audio, save\n\n*Import Audio\n\n*Give iTunes info\n\n*Add title to PlayList\n\n\nCurrently the PDF text gets extracted, doesn't end up where I expect, and the script then seems to hang on generating the audio. Simple TextEdit documents work fine.\nWhat's wrong?\n(This question is a continuation of one I asked yesterday: here)\n\nA: While Automator is pretty useful, I personally find the Terminal / command line a nice place to solve problems like this.\nThe basic idea is still using the steps you describe, but doing all the work from the command line. I researched a useful PDF-to-Text converter, and I found PDFminer quite useful. If you can get it to run, half of your work is done!\npip install pdfminer\n\nStep one and two, then can be solved with this one-liner in Terminal:\npdf2txt.py example.pdf | say -v Daniel -o example.aiff\n\nStill missing is the addition of metadata — what do you need here: Title / Album / \"Artist\"?\nIn a final step, you would add the file to a certain iTunes playlist. Depending on your ideal workflow, one then could build a little LaunchAgent that monitors a folder for new files...\n", "Q: App that caches Maps I've tried looking for an app that caches map data, so that it doesn't need an active Internet connection on the move.\nThe built-in one doesn't work well in that aspect. Caching the satellite maps turns out to be a nightmare because of the zoom levels involved. Only the road maps (the non-satellite ones) are somewhat easy to cache, depending on how large an area you want to cache.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to cache areas in the Maps apps?\n\n*If not, is there a good app that caches satellite/hybrid map data? Paid apps will do.\n\n\nA: I use the GaiaGPS App for my walks. This is free and does the job. You can save maps and use them once you're on the spot without any connexions. And you can zoom!\n\nA: Advanced caching options are not supported for the build-in maps application. If other applications would provide this using Google's maps data, they would act against the Google Maps TOS. See section 10.1.3 \"Restrictions against Data Export or Copying\" - (b) \"No Pre-Fetching, Caching, or Storage of Content\".\nThis leaves us with apps which use other maps data. Such as...\nOffMaps 2 (for iPhone/iPad)\nOffMaps 2 allows you to download maps for offline use. The maps data is originally retrieved from OpenStreetMap.\n\n*\n\n*You download maps on a per-region-basis. Two maps are included for free.\n\n*You can purchase a download 'licence' for unlimited maps for $5.99.\n\nI wondered myself how they could demand money for open data - they say:\n\nWe do not charge for the data, but for the service we provide around it. We clean the data and leverage its full potential from removing unneeded information via linked addresses with streets to providing a public transport layer. We also need money to feed the hamsters in our server farm treadmills.\n\n", "Q: Looking for an app to manage an archived music library My iTunes library is huge, so I am dragging music I no longer listen to, but I'd like to keep out of this into an archive folder.\nThe problem with this, is that the folder structure isn't preserved, and since many songs have the same name, I may lose some things if they are copied over. It also makes it hard to find artists or albums I want to retrieve.\nI'm looking for something like iTunes which will be able to watch a folder (or even manually import) and then create a folder structure to organise the music based on artist/album/track or something similar.\nI've tried 8 iTunes alternatives so far, and they either rely on iTunes existing library, or they simply create a structure within their own app and leave the folder unorganised.\nCan anyone offer any suggestions?\n\nA: iTunes will actually let you use multiple libraries if you want, and then can switch between them on launch. So if disk space (and just keeping the files where they were wasn't an issue), you could use a second library. \nIf you launch iTunes while holding down the Option key on your keyboard, you will get this dialog. \n\nYou could choose 'Create Library' here, and make a second library. \nUnfortunately, the storage location of your music is a iTunes general setting versus per library. But, there is the options in Preferences -> Advanced to not copy files into the iTunes Media folder. Changing this though would affect your main library too though.\n\nA: How about creating a new Mac user, and maintaining a separate iTunes library in that account?\nYou get a full and separate iTunes library which will be protected by system user permissions. It is easy to stage the music for copying via your public folder too. This would bring with it easy backups in the form of Time Machine as you would do for your own account. Restoring from a backup would be as simple as adding that user at the Migration Assistant stage.\n", "Q: Is storing an iMac sideways safe? I have some old devices in storage on their sides. They are otherwise completely normal - well ventilated, etc, etc. except that they could only fit when they are on their sides. After being reminded of them by a certain comment, I wondered if they were OK.\nSo: Is is safe to store an iMac on its side, assuming every other aspect of its storage is normal and safe?\n\nA: Yes, it won't hurt the iMac. In fact they can even be used sideways, as long as you don't block any vents. Hard drive bearings are said to last longest when they are either upright or flat, but apart from the convection-cooled Mac Cube I don't know of any Mac that depends on orientation for cooling or anything else. \nIf you are putting them away for any length of time, get some silica gel packets or a \"Thirsty Hippo\" or local equivalent to ensure humidity does not speed corrosion or otherwise damage your machines. Wrap them tightly in plastic to prevent critters crawling in, there is nothing worse than finding something living in your old computer. Dead bodies or other debris may be corrosive or conductive. If your iMac is the CRT kind consider cutting a panel out of plywood to protect the glass screen. CRTs are hard to smash but easy to scratch or chip.\nIf you are putting away anything really precious (iMac signed by the Steves?) best practice is sealing the computer in an environment of dry nitrogen gas - it's a serious measure but not actually that hard to do since airtight bags are easy to find and nitrogen is becoming common in auto tire shops. Removing oxygen prevents oxidisation (rust) and will also make it impossible for creatures to colonise your Mac since they cannot live without oxygen.\nIn the last decade the ROHS directive has seen the use of lead-free solder increase. One big problem with this is the growth of \"whiskers\" from the solder and other circuit elements that can bridge what should be gaps between circuit paths. While the exact cause of whiskers and the right way to prevent their growth post-manufacturing is still unknown there are minority suggestions that vacuum or nitrogen environments help - but from my reading, a temperature-controlled or even cycling environment is more likely to be effective. When the exact facts are known the right way to store computers long-term will probably change. But it's sad to think that there is a risk to our machines even if they are well cared-for. Modern Apple machines, since about 2006, conform to the ROHS directive so this applies to them. Older machines may well be manufactured using lead solder and so tin whiskers would not be an issue. I could not find a definitive answer.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 battery life on Wifi all day I want to ask what is the average life of your iPhone 4 running iOS 5, with Wifi turn on, and what you are doing is just surfing through Safari. I'm getting 1 percent decrease every 3 minutes. \n\nA: When actively browsing, that's not unusual.  1% every three minutes is 5 hours, which is expected if you've got the display on and using the wifi for browsing.\nIf it dropped 1% every three minutes with the display off, then you're likely running a background process that uses wifi and/or the GPS (turn by turn directions, running tracker, online streaming music, etc).\n", "Q: Can I use my iPhone as a hotspot on Wifi (instead of 3G/4G)? I would like to use my jailbroken iPhone as a hotspot for my MacBook. It works well when my 3G internet is enabled. But when I disable it, the hotspot menu becomes unavailable... even if my iPhone is connected on the WiFi network.\nI disabled the 3G to make sure it wouldn't use my 3G data plan.\nCan I use my iPhone as a hotspot on WiFi (instead of 3G)?\n\nA: According to an Apple Support KB:\n\nYou cannot use your Wi-Fi connection for Internet connectivity while\n  other devices are using Wi-Fi for Personal Hotspot. You can share only\n  a cellular data connection; you cannot share a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nThis KB mentions the support for hotspots, by device:\n\nWhile this Apple Support information might not apply to jail-broken devices, it's good for reference.\n\nA: You can do this with USB or Bluetooth tethering on jailbroken iOS devices using an app such as MyWi.  There are many other jailbreak apps for this function, so it's worth shopping around.  \nSome will only share the 3G internet connection, but I understand others will share any internet connection over USB or bluetooth.\nYou can't use wifi tethering to connect your computer to a wifi network your phone knows about.\nThe hotspot creates a new wireless network, but the iPhone is capable of attaching to only one wireless network at a time.  It cannot connect to a wireless network with internet and create its own wireless network to share.\nSince the iPhone is on the wireless network, though, you can get your computer on that same network since it will likely be in range.\n", "Q: What are the apps in iOS app store which are used to fetch data from External Accessories? I am searching for some of the apps in App store, which have been developed to get data from External Accessories. Is it mandatory to have an MFi device, to download an app for the Mfi device?\n\nA: \nIs it mandatory to have an MFi device, to download an app for the Mfi device?\n\nNo. For instance you can download the Oscium apps and use them in demo mode without owning or attaching the hardware MFi device they interface with.\nYou keep asking specifically about MFi devices, but there are also a number of non-MFi devices that connect through the headphone jack, such as credit card readers (square, intuit, and others) and heart rate monitors (60beat.com).\nSo far Apple has allowed many of these devices and apps to be developed and sold in the app store, although they prefer people use the MFi program, it's not always necessary.\n", "Q: Is there a way to show an icon in the status bar if iPad is muted? I \"accidentally\" muted the iPad (four finger up, slide to the left, push mute button). After that in iBooks an interactive book didn't play ambient audio, which is OK if you remember the muting. But it was playing other sound effects which was confusing. I thought that something is wrong with the iBooks app.\nAfter hours I noticed the muted button...\n(My mute switch on the side is changed to screen locker.)\n\nA: iOS does not have an option for this, nor does apple approve apps which alter the status bar.  If you want this function you will have to jailbreak your iOS device and install a third party status monitor.  As pointed out in another answer, LockInfo does this.  SBSettings used to, but no longer does.  If you're running an iOS 4.x device, OpenNotifier might be useful as it does this as well as give you pull-down notifications similar to android and iOS 5.\nIf you're developing for this device, however, you can add this function yourself.  As a developer you can run custom code without jailbreaking the device - you just can't submit that code to the app store.\nThe trick, then, is going to be finding example code for this feature.  I expect someone in the jailbreaking community will have some info on what the code needs to do, and if you're lucky you'll find an open source project for it.  Then you can compile and sign it yourself, and as long as you keep your ad-hoc license current and recompile/re-sign it yearly, you can use it on your personal devices.\nI think a lot of developers overlook the fact that they can run any code they want on their own devices without jailbreaking.  They can also distribute such apps in a limited manner to their friends using adhoc distribution as well.\nIt looks like OpenNotifier is open source, and has the functionality you need:\nhttps://github.com/n00neimp0rtant/OpenNotifier\nI don't know much about the status of the project, but it might be usable for you as a developer to bring this functionality to your devices.\n\nA: If you jailbreak your iPad, you can install LockInfo, which has a setting for this.\n", "Q: How to switch input languages with different key combination? I don't like to switch languages with ⌘ + space. Is there any way I can use more common keyboard combinations: \n\n\n*\n\n*Control + Shift or\n\n*Control + Opion or\n\n*Caps Lock\nI'd preferred the simplest solution possible. Can I just change some system settings instead of installing a software to solve this problem?\n\nA: I already use PuntoSwitcher which does the trick but it has some annoying bugs and it's  only useful for russian-speaking users because UI is only in russian. That's why I want to find an alternative.\nThe main purpose of PuntoSwitcher is to fixe words typed with wrong keyboard layout. For example:\n\nруддщ → hello\nghbdtn → привет \n\nSo it may be useful for somebody who uses russian a lot (outsourcing managers, people who learn russian, etc). \n\nA: You can change the key combination via System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Keyboard & Text Input:\n\nThe settings you’re looking for are the last two in the list: “Select the previous input source” and “Select next source in Input menu”.\n", "Q: How to make clicking on icon in dock == open new instance I have several applications in my dock that can have multiple instances open (eg.

You can achieve this without a launcher app with Mission Control set up to have more than one virtual desktop on Big Sur and later.\nIn order to open a new window in the current desktop:\n\n*\n\n*Open preferences->mission control and disable \"When switching to an application...\"\n\n*Now let's say you have opened your app in the Desktop1 and you're in the Desktop2.

I can drag \"New iTerm.app\" to my Dock and it'll be a Dock icon I can click on any time I want to get a new iTerm window open. But the icon is the generic AppleScript icon.\nLet's change it to the iTerm icon. Select \"New iTerm.app\" on the Desktop and click Cmd-I to bring up the properties screen for the application.\nNow navigate to /Applications in a Finder window, find iTerm in the list of installed applications, select it and click Cmd-I to open the properties screen for the iTerm application.\nClick the icon in the iTerm info window so it gets a soft blue shadow around it. Press Cmd-C to copy the icon to the clipboard.\nNow click the icon in the \"New iTerm.app\" info window and press Cmd-V to paste the iTerm icon on to the \"New iTerm.app\" application.\n\nIt should now have an iTerm icon.\nYou can move the \"New iTerm.app\" to your /Applications folder if you like. Drag it from the folder you decide to keep it in, back to your dock, and you can now click on it in the Dock to open up a new iTerm window with every click.\nIf you wanted to be able to distinguish it from the running iTerm.app Dock icon you could consider pasting the icon in to an image editor like Pixelmator and adding a big red + to it so it's clearly identified as the icon to press for a new iTerm window instead of the icon to press to see the exiting, open iTerm application.\nHere are some more scripts for some other applications to get you started customizing things:\nGoogle Chrome (New Window)\nset myapp to \"Google Chrome\"\non appIsRunning(appName)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to (name of processes) contains appName\nend appIsRunning\nif appIsRunning(myapp) then\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        make new window\n    end tell\nelse\n    tell application myapp\n        activate\n    end tell\nend if\n\nGoogle Chrome (New Tab)\nset myapp to \"Google Chrome\"\non appIsRunning(appName)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to (name of processes) contains appName\nend appIsRunning\nif appIsRunning(myapp) then\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        make new tab at end of tabs of window 1\n    end tell\nelse\n    tell application myapp\n        activate\n    end tell\nend if\n\nSublime Text 2\nUnfortunately ST2 doesn't seem to have an AppleScript accessible extensions.

I have an iPod Nano (6th generation). I bought it 10 months ago. I fully charged it and it started to work. Since then, I left it 10 months without using nor charging. Now, when I connect it to PC, it charges, but after detaching from PC, it says 'Connect to power'. What is the problem? Is its battery damaged? What should I do?\n\nA: The battery in your iPod has died. I suggest making an appointment at your local Apple Store Genius Bar and they may be able to replace it for you.\n\nA: Fixed it! there wasn't any problem with battery. just charged it with a charger (not with usb) and it started to work.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my trusty iPod which I had plugged into my Audi's adapter. It worked perfect for years. I recently moved it to my new Audi (which no longer has a built in adapter).  Up came a message \"connect to power\" with a picture of a battery. Plugged into USB outlet on my car with a cord I had not used in years and no luck, then plugged into outlet in home with no luck.\nMy wife fixed it by using a cord from her older iPad. In short check your cord first.\n\nA: I recently tried to restore my 2004 20GB iPod Classic; and got the \"plug in to power outlet\" to complete the restore. The iPod was then stuck on this for 24 hours+ using a 30 pin - USB plugged into my Apple iPhone charger. What I did was connect it direct to a 2 gang with USB socket (in the UK) via an Amazon's Basics 30 pin - USB lead which my wife uses to charge her iPad2 - this immediately started charging the iPod. I seem to recall Apple going from 12v to 5v (or something like that) with the iPhone4(?) - so I'm guessing not enough juice was present to complete the restore process.\nAnyway, hope that this might help someone.\n", "Q: Does daisy chaining FireWire 800 and 400 cause all devices to use 400 speeds? I recently purchased a Drobo, and in looking over some online documentation, I encountered this support article which states:\n\nIf a FireWire 400 device is also connected, it will pull down the overall performance to match FireWire 400 (FW400) instead of FireWire 800 speeds.\n\nI realize that if I attached a FireWire 800 device to a 400 device, and then that 400 device to my computer that obviously I'd only see 400 speeds from the 800 device, but this KB article seems to imply that connecting a 400 device to the other FW port on my Drobo, and having my Drobo connected via 800 to my Mac, will cause the Drobo to communicate at 400 speeds.\nIs this true? Is this a limitation of the FireWire protocol, a practical limitation common to many implementations of FireWire, or a limitation specific to the Drobo itself?\n\nA: FireWire is a point to point protocol and the controllers are generally fully functional and can use the full capacity  between two adjoining controller chips over a FireWire cable. So in practice just don't put a FireWire 400 speed cable between devices that are capable of FireWire 800 and the computer. Place your first FireWire 400 cable and device at the end of the chain of FireWire 800 capable devices.\n\nBasically a FireWire 400 cable has six conductors - two for power and four for data. FireWire 800 cable has eight (or double) the data conductors and the same two power lanes.\nThink of an analogy with the interstate highway system. Here you have a computer connected via fire wire 800 to the Drobo and fire wire 400 to something else. This is the same as three highway exits with four lanes of traffic between the middle and the last exit and eight lanes of traffic between the first in the middle exit. Assuming there's no delay getting on and off the highway exits (which is true for FireWire but not in reality), it shouldn't matter that traffic between the first two exits will be slowed down just because later on the highway merges down to four lanes. \nOf course when you have simultaneous traffic some going all the way to the end of the chain at the 400 speed that will impact the bandwidth available for traffic between the two 800 speed ports. \nThe FireWire protocol is fast for exactly this reason whereas the USB chain always slows down for the entire \"bus\". From an engineering standpoint it's simpler and cheaper to just slow down the entire transport to avoid having to deal with the network topology and differing link speeds due to cabling conditions down the chain. \n\nA: It depends primarily on how the devices are connected.\nSay we have three devices connected:\nA(400) <--> B(800) <--> C(800)\n\nFirewire is processed in chips.  800 speed firewire chipsets will pass 400 speed along the 800 bus at 400 speeds as data is passed along the chain. So anything C sends will be seen by B and A as 400 speed, and it will exist as 400 speed on the 800 bus between A and B.  It doesn't increase the 400's total bandwidth, but it does take twice as long to transmit along the 800 bus as it would if B had sent it natively.\nWhen B sends to A it will be at 800 speeds.\nThe problem is that if A is particularly communicative then it will drag down the total bandwidth of the 800 bus between B and C.  If A transmits at full speed, the 800 bus becomes a 400 bus.  If A transmits 25% of the time, then its 100mbps data consumes 200mbps of time on the 800 bus.\nWhen C sends data to A, it will be at 400 speeds, and use up twice the bandwidth on the 800 bus than it would if it were transmitting native 800.\nThis is called multi-speed concatenation.\nWhen B notices C sending 400 speed data, it simply passes that data along the 800 bus at 400 speeds.  When that packet is done it can immediately send the next packet at 800.  The transition is instantaneous, so there's no additional bandwidth lost, but again, if A talks a lot, it can reduce the total bandwidth on the 800 bus significantly.\nB(800) <--> A(400) <--> C(800)\n\nThis configuration will reduce the total bandwidth through the entire bus to 400, regardless of the chipset used in each device.\n", "Q: How would I make a keyboard shortcut to *maximize* the current window? I love using the keyboard in Windows. It's an integrated part of the OS, and it feels like it; nearly every mouse action has a keyboard equivalent.\nHowever, as I am starting to use Macs more and more, I'm missing two things primarily from Windows: the ability to maximize (not whatever the green button does (what does it do?))- windows and the ability to maximize windows from the keyboard.\nThus, without further ado: How can I maximize windows with a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: One of the easiest ways to do this is to use BetterTouchTool. It will let you bind a keyboard shortcut or a trackpad shortcut to many commands, including maximize window.\nOnce you are in the BTT settings page, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Keyboard tab on top.\n\n*On the bottom near Keyboard shortcut, enter in whichever keyboard shortcut you want.\n\n*For Predefined action, choose Maximize Window.\n\n\nThere are many other options related to maximizing besides \"Maximize Window\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Maximize Window Left\n\n*Maximize Window Right\n\n*Maximize Window To Bottom Half\n\n*Maximize Window To Top Half\n\n*Maximize To Next Monitor\n\n\nA: I have assigned this script to ⌘M with FastScripts:\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\" to bounds of window of desktop\n    tell application (path to frontmost application as text)\n        set bounds of window 1 to result\n    end tell\non error\n    try\n        tell application \"System Events\" to tell (process 1 where it is frontmost)\n            click (button 1 of window 1 where subrole is \"AXZoomButton\")\n        end tell\n    end try\nend try\n\nIt doesn't work with multiple displays though.\nApplications that haven't been mentioned by other answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*ShiftIt\n\n*SizeUp\n\n*Slate\n\nA: You can use an application like Divvy to do this. Divvy lets you select a rectangular area that you want the current window to take up. Selecting the entire screen lets you do a Windows-like \"maximize\" to have the frontmost window take up all available space on the screen.\nIt also lets you define keyboard shortcuts for specific rectangular selections that you want to use frequently. These can either be per-app, or a \"global shortcut\" that will work with all apps. To define them, right-click on the Divvy menu bar icon, select preferences, and select \"Shortcuts\". Click \"new\" and you'll be presented with a screen to define the selection and the keys you want to use:\n\n\nA: BetterSnapTool (by the same author as BetterTouchTool) will allow you to do this. You can either drag the window to the top of the screen to maxmimise it (á la Windows 7) or define a shortcut key. There are also lots of other options such as maximise left-half or right-half etc. Its also only £1.49/$1.99 on the app store, which is almost free :-)\n\n\nA: There's another great app called Moom -- similar to Divvy, but only $5.\nIt does everything Divvy does, plus keyboard resizing, drag-to-edge-ing, etc.\n\n\nA: There is a built-in way to do what you want. I currently have Mountain Lion but I suspect it will work on Lion, Snow Leopard and earlier too*:\nTrick we'll use:\nHolding the Shift key when pressing the Zoom button (the green button) maximizes the window the way Windows does. We'll add a keyboard shortcut for Zoom that contains the Shift key.\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*Select \"Application Shortcuts\" and press the plus sign (+).\n\n*Make a new Zoom keyboard shortcut that contains the Shift key:\n\n\n*\n\n*Application: All Applications\n\n*Menu Title: Zoom \n(that's the name of the green button's function)\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut: Anything that suits you. Make sure it contains the Shift key!\n(e.g. Ctrl-Cmd-Shift-Z.  Make sure it doesn't clash with existing shortcuts, e.g. Cmd-Shift-Z with Redo).\nEDIT:\nTurns out it doesn't work on Safari (and others probably) - I was using it with Google Chrome. The app has to be programmed to support it.. \n* If someone with Leopard/Snow Leopard/Lion can confirm I would be grateful.\n\nA: To do a full maximize, press ctrl-cmd-f\nBy \"full maximize\" I mean the kind where the menubars go into auto-hide mode.

While this battery DOES hold charge, when it is on the charger, MacBook still states \"Not Charging.\"\nI've tried the SMC Reset, taking out the battery, even reinstalling OS! (I wanted to clean install Lion.)\nThe new battery is an Apple battery.\nWhy is it doing this?? Also, when I boot into Windows, there's no problem like that. (I need Windows for work. =( )\nHere are the screenshots.\n\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention - there's no light when I put MacBook on charger. I've tried other chargers. I've tried charging other MacBook. It's not the adapter.\n\nA: Since you've already removed the battery and reset the SMC as mentioned in this Apple Support KB, your best bet is probably to bring in your MacBook to an Apple store to get checked out by one of the Genius techs. This is especially true since you've already replaced the battery with a new Apple battery.\n", "Q: Apache module run under MacPorts gives SQLite error I have an Apache module, compiled from source, which works just fine with the stock Apache 2.2 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.7.

My hands were a little wet when I touched the touchpad on my MacBook Pro 15\". I think that a little water went into the cracks, or the tiny space around touchpad. The \"click\" mechanism stopped working properly. Multitouch still works perfectly. \nI ordered a new touchpad, but NO! Problem remained. Touchpad still only registers \"clicks\" from bottom left corner. \nI use my comp for work (Photoshop, Illustrator).\nI tried loosening, tightening the screw on touchpad. Still nada.\nPlease help?\nEdit: I need the physical \"click.\" I use laptop for work. The touch to click does not function well with real work in Illustrator and Photoshop. I don't want to sound like a jerk, but please don't suggest the use of a mouse or \"touch to click\". These are not real answers to my question.\n\nA: Check your MacBook's battery. My trackpad stopped clicking consistently, and then sometimes locked in click-down, keeping me from de-selecting things. When I opened it up I noticed that the battery was puffed up a bit. If I removed the battery and closed the case, the trackpad clicked just fine. Apple replaced the battery and all's good.\n\nA: Try pushing down relatively firmly on the trackpad but not so hard to break the glass or damage the delicate springs. By pressing on all four corners, you can sometimes dislodge a piece of crumb on a pad that moves physically. \nWithout opening the computer, I’m 100% sure if it fixed the problem for me (MacBook Pro 15\" Mid 2014) by pushing the battery back into place so that the trackpad can move down more when clicking it or if it was debris. I suppose if it’s battery swelling, that will just get worse again but then I’ll know. \nSource: the comments in this YouTube video.\nEDIT I was thinking this could be caused by picking up the MacBook (with the screen folded open) with one hand on one corner next to the trackpad, as I do now and then. I can imagine this pushing up the battery a little bit or slowly undo or break the plastic fasteners. \n\nA: I had the same issue. I checked the battery, and it's also puffed up! I took it out and this solved all the trackpad issues I had.  ow, hopefully Apple will be nice about replacing the battery!\nI had recently had a lot of issues with the computer overheating, which had mysteriously stopped just before the track pad stopped working. Somehow related to the puffed up battery, perhaps?\n\nA: If you really work in Photoshop or Illustrator, get the Wacom for god sake.\nRegarding the touchpad it is a common issue. Mine seems better when I start working but required more and more firm clicks during the work. Going to disassemble the laptop, fix the battery position, and reassemble. \nThat happened after I spilled a cup of tea on it 2 days ago.\n\nA: Since you said that the multi-touch on the trackpad works, one work around is to enable the Tap to click setting in System Preferences > Trackpad:\n\nThis way you can tap your trackpad to click instead of having to rely on physically depressing it.\n", "Q: How can I force a Photo Stream sync on the iPhone? The Settings page says that Photos will automatically by sent to Photo Stream when I am connected to Wi-Fi, however I've waited several minutes and don't see them in iPhoto. I believe they haven't been sent to iCloud yet. Is there any way to force them to be synced to iCloud from the iPhone?\n\nA: Echoing this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Activity Monitor\n\n*Search for Photos Agent and quit it.\n\n*Restart the Photos app.\n\n\nA: I found this post after having the same issue - needing to grab an image from Photo Stream that wasn't coming up.\nI found that I had wandered outside my WiFi range, and had reverted to a 3G connection. Upon reconnecting to my WiFi, Photo Stream immediately updated (and I mean immediately :)\nI checked this by opening my Photo Stream within the Photos app, and taking a screenshot. Within one second my phone started uploading the new image, and within 10 seconds it was live within my Photo Stream.\nIf you're having long delays check your WiFi connection - This may not be the only reason for a delay, but it helped me in my situation.\n\nA: In my case, it was nothing mentioned in the other answers. My problem was that I didn't have enough space.\n\nI don't quite understand why it needs space locally to upload something though.\nMore info in this forum thread.\nUpdate:\nAnother realistic reason could be this:\n\nSo make sure you're connected to a wireless network.\n\nA: Go to iCloud Preferences > Photo Stream. Uncheck \"Enable Photo Stream\", then click apply. Turn Photo Stream back on in preferences (check \"Enable Photo Stream\"). After a few seconds, iPhoto will start to download all the photos again. Depending on the number of photos, and your bandwidth, it may take awhile.\n(Disable Shared Photo Streams on the SUBSCRIBER device, then enable again.)\n\nA: I figured out if you turn off Photos and start again it starts working.\n\nA: Fastest solution (iPhone restart NOT needed!): I've found that if I open Photos on my iDevice after taking a photo, and then (after the spinning icon goes away) open Photos* on my Mac, the photo appears in my photo stream.\n\nNotes:\nThis is way easier and faster than rebooting or resetting Wi-Fi.\nIt's also faster and more likely to work than just killing Photos Agent and restarting Photos.\n(Further evidence showing WHY this works: When I open Photos on my iDevice, I see the spinning icon on my iDevice - IFF  I've just taken a photo.  If I access my photo stream on my Mac‡ without having opened Photos, the new photo is not there.)\n\n*(or iPhoto if you haven't switched to Photos)\n‡(such as by clicking Photo Stream under Media in the standard File..Open dialog box in recent versions of MacOS)\nNote: Photo Stream only syncs the last 30 days of your photos.\n2020 UPDATE: Recently, Photos was changed; when you open it you may need to take an additional step to cause the upload - but if so, you’ll see a prompt about it.\n\nA: I had this very problem today. I had taken 40 or so photos on iPhone 4, iOS 5.1, and when I got back to WiFi connection, I waited more than an hour for the photos to appear in PhotoStream either on the iPhone or my iPad, and they didn't.\nNone of the following worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switching the iPhone to Airplane mode and back\n\n*Killing the Camera and Photos apps\n\n*Turning off Photo Stream in the iCloud bit of the Settings app (this told me it would delete all PhotoStream photos on the iPhone, so I cancelled)\n\n\nEventually, after an hour or so, in desparation I forced the iPhone to power-down, and turned it back on.\nToday's photos then started appearing straight away on the iPad. In the time it has taken me to type this, most of them have now arrived already.\n\nA: I've been searching this question too.  I found that if you go to the iCloud control panel and uncheck the photo stream box.  Hit Apply.  Recheck the photo stream box.  For me. hiting Apply again, my pc started to pull down the new photos right away.\n\nA: Nevermind, read this instead: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/48270/15253\n\nA: Make sure Low Power Mode is turned off. It blocks all syncs of images.\n\nA: In a similar situation, just keeping the Photos app open on the iPhone caused photos to start syncing immediately for me.

However the notes aren't as easy as I would like in the iOS app.\n\nA: OmniFocus for iPhone meets all but the web-based service criterion (there is a MacOS X companion application which came first).  If you are away from all your iOS/Mac devices, you're stuck.\nI've used Remember the Milk, Things, Toodledo (synced with ToDo), and a half-dozen others - OmniFocus is the best, hands down.\n\nA: I swear by Awesome Note and would be lost without it. \nIt does all the things you mentioned on your list (with the possible exception of projects). You can sync with Google Docs and Evernote. The only thing I'd personally like to see, which may or may not bother you, is an Mac version so I can edit my todo's whilst I'm at my computer.\nThere's also a free trial version on the app store.\n\n\nA: Wunderkit has everything you need, and more. (I personally use its stripped-down version, Wunderlist, for personal tasks - make sure you check it out as well.) Wunderkit is a perfect tool for collaboration (sharing tasks and workspaces, commenting, tracking team progress), but also works flawlessly for personal task management.\nHere are some of the features (I think these cover each and every requirement of yours):\n\n\n*\n\n*Workspaces (that is, separate spaces for projects)\n\n*Tasks (tags, assignees, due dates, recurring tasks, comments, starring)\n\n*Notification-type badges for tasks due today\n\n*Notes (also with tags)\n\n*Syncing between apps\n\n*Available for Mac OS X, iPhone, and as a web app\n\n\nI expect the app to be available on more devices soon. I base this assumption on the fact that the before-mentioned Wunderlist is available on iOS, Android, Blackberry, WinPhone, Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.\nOh, and the best part: it's wonderfully designed, and it's free.\n\n\nA: Toodledo (the online to-do service) also has a companion iPhone App.  This app has:\n\n\n*\n\n*Due-dates for each item\n\n*Notes for each item\n\n*sync to Toodledo service\n\n*Repeatable to-dos \n\n*Prioritization\n\n*Groups\n\n*Application badge\n\n*Projects (if you are a \"Pro\" yearly subscriber)\n\n\nIt's not as pretty as 2Do, but it is doing everything I need it to.  My only complaint is that the App Badge is not always accurate, even if I'm not editing tasks on the Toodledo site.  \n\nA: I use Wrike (also in iTunes), and would recommend it as a great productivity app. It has everything you mentioned:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can create tasks with and without due dates and prioritize them on your list with drag-and-drop;\n\n*Task description can be easily used as a notepad – you can overview changes in chronological order which is handier than taking separate notes;\n\n*Personally I keep my company’s projects together with personal to-do lists in Wrike. You can group your tasks into folders and subfolders, and include one task into multiple folders;\n\n*There are filters for sorting your tasks by due date, completion date, and more;\n\n*In web version you also can create custom widgets with tasks due today (or basically any other criterion), and Wrike will show you an up-to-date task list on the dashboard once you log in;\n\n*The service integrates with GMail and Dropbox, so you can combine it with whatever tools you already use for your work.\n\n\nA: I have used 2Do, Clear, Any.DO and finally decided to create Q (kyoo) out of frustration with all of the above for lacking features I needed or having too many features I had absolutely no need for.\n\nA: I would recommend adding Must Do Today to the list.

Is there a way to pasword-protect on a per-app basis, e.g. lock mail, but not photos. This is under iOS 5.1 on a iPhone 4S. The password doesn't need to be different between apps, however.\nEDIT: This is with a iPhone 4S, not jailbroken.\n\nA: No, there is no way to do this on iOS 5.1 or on any earlier version of iOS.\nIt's doubtful that Apple will add this feature, given their usual proclivity toward not including features that could be difficult to configure and support, particularly on iOS.\nThis of course means that each app developer can implement their own passcode locking mechanism. It's just not an API that Apple provides to developers to ask again for the same passcode before it operates as opposed to locking the entire device.\n\nA: Apple view these devices as personal so there are no multiuser features. But mail in particular is useful to lock in case you hand your phone over to someone to show some photos, even just for a few minutes. Some people suggest just turning off mail in settings but that doesn't remove cached mail and isn't secure. There is an app called Better Webmail that might meet your needs: PIN locking, supports Yahoo and Gmail etc.\n", "Q: Is there a better photo application than iPhoto for managing iPhone videos and photos? I've been using iPhoto for my photos and videos.  However, it's become so slow, I'm lucky if it can download my 2 or 3 photos/videos when I leave my computer on overnight.  And then I have to often force quit iPhoto even after unplugging my iPhone because it just makes my computer unbearably sluggish.\nI'd love it if I can solve this problem, but really iPhoto is not ideal for me anyway.  Backing up through dropbox is not seamless.  I need to create aliases and each computer needs to have their own folders and cannot share the organization.  The organization of the photos and videos is not great either.\nI think I have pretty common needs for photo/video management.  I also love the iCloud photostream.  What's the best photo/video management tool?\n\nA: The only other app on the Mac that can access photostream is Aperture. So your choices are migrate to Aperture - and that's even less designed with sharing in mind - or fix iPhoto. Performance issues like you describe can be down to a number of issues - Disk Space, Ram, bunged up caches and so on. What fixes have you tried?\n\nA: Yes - software for video storage that beats iPhoto in my book is available. I really like ClipStart for managing video permanently on my Mac. I do find myself using iMovie on the phone and the iPad a lot to put together a quick movie, but ClipStart works really well for the findesktop age and organization of all my video. I'll occasionally put my iPhone video into iMovie on the Mac don't prefer it for storing all my video.\nOn the photo side of things it's really simplest to just keep everything in iPhoto you can make smart albums and such to organize and sequester your iPhone pictures and keep them separate from the DSLR or other single-purpose cameras. \nThe only exception to this seems to be people who do photography as a serious hobby or professionally. In that case I've seen them use products like Photo Mechanic or Aperture for the serious DSLR pictures and just use iPhoto and ClipStart for storing mobile pictures/video footage. I've seen good editors use Photo Mechanic on an old PPC PowerBook to fly through thousands of pictures without delay it stores pictures in the file system using folders so it's far preferred of you want to know where the pictures are and future proof without needing to export from iPhoto's database. You do lose tight integration with things like photo stream, but lots of good options exist in this software space. \n", "Q: What is the best way to clone a disk between two Macs? What is the best way to clone a disk between two Macs? I ask this every couple years or so and every time I get the same answer. \"Use Carbon Copy Cloner\", they say. But the unfortunate fact is that CCC is a file-level copy between disks. When I migrate to my new Mac, sure all the files are there but there are quirks here and there (including file dates being different etc). \nSo, really now, once again: how do you clone the disk over byte-for-byte?\n\nA: You can use the dd command to make a bit-perfect clone of a drive. It's a command line tool that ships with OS X. In order to make the clone perfect you'll need to ensure the source and the destination aren't actively in use.\nTo prepare for the clone I recommend creating a secondary boot disk that you can boot from. Your source for the clone should be an offline volume, not in use, when you're making the copy. Otherwise you risk copying things that are in incomplete states on disk.\nWith your machine booted to your secondary boot disk, log in and fire up a Terminal or iTerm window.\nRun diskutil to get a list of your available drives. One of them will be your target drive you're trying to clone. The other will be your source drive.

Start the clone with:\n> sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk0 of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m conv=noerror,sync\n\nWhen dd finishes you may see an error like this:\ndd: /dev/rdisk2: short write on character device\ndd: /dev/rdisk2: Input/output error\n3726+1 records in\n3726+1 records out\n500107862016 bytes transferred in 14584.393113 secs (34290619 bytes/sec)\n\nThat last error message is actually okay. The last block written was a short block because there wasn't a full 1MB block to copy. No worries.\nNow you've got a bit-wise perfect clone of your Macintosh HD drive. Reboot your system using the Macintosh HD drive and enjoy your clone! And when we say bit-wise perfect we mean it. The disk structure is copied block-by-block so this dd approach works to copy data from a disk that uses a partitioning scheme that macOS doesn't natively support.\n\nA: Carbon copy cloner was good, but then on my Mac Pro it no longer made bootable clones, I tried it 3 times and every clone failed to boot unlike previously.\nSo I switched to SuperDuper! and that clone booted fine\n\nA: Apple's bespoke command line utility to do disk cloning is asr.\nIt is tailored to the specifics of OS X needs to perform file by file as well as block based imaging and deals with differences in partition sizes, allows network streaming (and even multicast streaming) as well as copying between disks that are locally connected. Unlike dd, it knows about Apple's latest Core Storage volume management and is the program that the graphical Disk Utility calls to move data from one partition or volume to another.\nYou can read more at the manual page for asr.\n\nA: Verbose output from dd via pv\n\nCopying even a small disk can take a long time and the silence can be frustrating. If you install pv (pipe viewer) you can use it to monitor the progress of any stream.\nIf you are using homebrew (and you should be) installing pv is as easy as:\nbrew install pv\n\nThen decide which disks you want to copy.\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage SSD                     250.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            SSD                    +249.8 GB   disk1\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                                 2CFBB247-D59D-474F-8467-2B1BDB275524\n                                 Unencrypted\n\n/dev/disk2 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.6 GB    disk2\n   1:             Windows_FAT_32 boot                    43.0 MB    disk2s1\n   2:                      Linux                         15.5 GB    disk2s2\n\n/dev/disk3 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.6 GB    disk3\n   1:             Windows_FAT_32 NO NAME                 15.6 GB    disk3s1\n\nIn this case /dev/disk2 is an Micro SD card from my Raspberry Pi in the internal reader and /dev/disk3 is a new MicroSD in a USB dongle.\nThe command to copy it is going to be very similar to common dd commands except we are going to take advantage of the fact that of (output file) defaults to STDOUT and if (input file) defaults to STDIN. This allows you to use unix pipes in between.

Between two Mac OS Extended volumes, this'll do a block copy, i.e. it just copies the volume structures, so all the files come out identical (down to the file ID numbers).  This is essentially the same thing dd does, except that Disk Utility can expand/contract the volume if the destination isn't exactly the same size as the source, and it's a lot faster (for some reason, dd is quite slow on OS X).\nEDIT: After seeing @Ian's note about speed using /dev/rdiskN vs. /dev/diskN, I ran some quick&dirty benchmarks copying between two 4GB flash drives:\ndd using /dev/diskN: 2737 seconds\ndd using /dev/rdiskN: 907 seconds\nDisk Util, full volume: 840 seconds to copy + 213 seconds to verify\nDisk Util, empty volume: 4 seconds to copy + 1 second to verify\n\nSo it looks like the rdisk suggestion makes dd run about the same speed as Disk Utility; the real differences are that Disk Utility verifies its data (slower, but maybe safer) and skips blank space (faster if the disk isn't nearly full).  That, and as I said above DU can resize as it copies.\n\nA: How about good ol' fashioned dd. It can make a bit-by-bit copy of your drive. There are lots of guides out there on how to do this such as this one or this one\n\nA: There are two types of cloning Mac drive. File level and block level based cloning. As we know carbon copy cloner can create file level based clone only and its one of the big competitor Superduper can create clone of volumes and partition only not the whole disk. So, I will suggest to go for a new emerging Mac cloning software that is Stellar Drive Clone capable to both file level and block level cloning.\nIt can create bit by bit exact copy of your entire drive and particular volumes on your any external drive, volume and network drive too. It can create clone of drive on folder and restore backups from the same in its free demo version feature. It can create clone of recovery HD and support window file formats, MBR, ExFAT, FAT32 etc on your Mac. \n", "Q: Mac OS X 10.6.8 - Can't remove SophosUpdate Packages/Folders on Desktop Every day a new \"SophosUpdate\" folder/package will appear on my desktop (see screenshot).\nWhen I highlight it my trash can turns into an eject button.  When I drag them to the eject button nothing happens.  Also nothing happens when I right click one of them and select \"eject\".\nThe only thing that got rid of them once was starting up in safe mode but they keep coming back after that.\nDoes anyone know what I can do?  I'm stuck.\n\n\nA: \nWhen I highlight it my trash can turns into an eject button.\n\nThis is a huge clue, because it indicates that this is a mounted volume (presumably a mounted image of the update package) and not an actual folder in ~/Desktop.\nIf you enter mount or diskutil list at a terminal prompt, does anything called SophosUpdate show up? If you see one or more of these listed, you should be able to unmount it with sudo diskutil unmount force /dev/diskN where N is the disk number. Alternately, sudo diskutil unmount force \"/Volumes/Volume Name\" has the same effect.\n\nA: you have to do it through Terminal\n# sudo rm -rf ~/Desktop/SophosUpdate\n\nit should ask you for your password and return nothing, to verify that it completed without any errors try this command\n# echo $?\n\nif you get 0 that means everything went ok, if any other number then something was wrong. at that point I suggest you to try Disk Utility to \"Verify Disk\" and/or \"Verify Disk Permissions\"\n\nA: Looks like your Sophos antivirus cannot perform automatic update. Try running it manually or just disable auto updates.\nReinstalling it could also help.\nAlso, have you tried permission check from disk utility?\n\nA: I ended up uninstalling sophos and installed the free personal edition instead of the one I had (corporate?).\nIt's been working fine since then.\nI guess it still doesn't answer the more general question of how to remove a strange mounted item on your desktop with that red bar through it.  Any ideas on that?\n", "Q: Date original picture was taken using EXIF Wizard I received a text with a picture yesterday. I am testing EXIF Wizard. When I saved the pic to my camera roll (iPhone 4) and view it in EXIF Wizard, it gives today's date. How do I get the date the original picture was taken?\n\nA: You should find good EXIF information, including the date the picture was taken, for pictures you took with the iPhone.\nHowever, the problem you're facing is that the image you're examining is an SMS picture.\nSMS picture messages, typically called MMS, don't include EXIF metadata.  When the image is saved to your camera roll the iPhone adds EXIF data, which includes the date the image was saved to the photo roll.\nIf you look at past saved SMS pictures, you'll find the EXIF info shows the date you received it, not today, nor when the picture was actually captured.\nThe MMS format does not specify a metadata area, so it's not a limitation of the iPhone - you'll also see this on any phone that can send and receive MMS images.\nWays around this limitation include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Email images (retains EXIF as it's sent as a JPG)\n\n*Save image online (photobucket, imgur, etc) and text message a link\n\n*Use iMessage (Not confirmed, but should keep EXIF)\n\n\nThe reason this is the case, and why it's not going to be resolved soon, is that each phone model had a different way of encoding and sending MMS - this flexibility allowed it to go into many different handsets more cheaply than if they stuck to one specification.  Once it reaches the phone carrier, it's converted back to an image. All the information is a simple image, and two phone numbers. The carrier then stores the image, converted to a common format, and sends a note to the destination carrier about the MMS message and where it can be found. The destination carrier retrieves it, reformats it for the target phone (again, probably a different format for a different phone) and then notifies the phone that it has an MMS available. When the user requests to view it, it is retrieved from the carrier's servers and displayed on the phone.\nThe EXIF meta data is lost very early in the process.\nYou can find out more about this system by searching for 3GPP Specification.\n", "Q: Sync iPhone Associated with Library That No Longer Exists One of the iPhones in our household is associated with an iTunes library that no longer exists.  The computer that the iTunes library was on had to be wiped clean due to warranty maintenance.  There is data (music, photos, contacts, etc.) on the iPhone that we do not want to lose by associating it with a new iTunes library.\nHow do we create the new library association without data loss?\n\nA: Your photos and contacts can generally be transferred to the new library without any problems via the initial sync to/from the new library. You will need to configure your target photo sync location (probably either iPhoto or a directory).\nHowever, with music (and probably movies), transferring depends on the original source. If you purchased them through iTunes, authorize the computer/new library and transfer your purchases. However, if not all of the music was obtained via iTunes, you will need to transfer the music from the iPhone to the computer, or you'll lose them during the initial sync. This transfer can be accomplished by a number of different software programs. You can then manually add the music to the new library.\nFinally, this wiki article contains a number of links that discuss methods to transfer data from iPhone to both PCs and Macs. Note: The software used in the wiki seem to be freeware, but I can't vouch for them, as I've never used those programs before.\n", "Q: Can I use AirDrop if one or more of the participating computers is asleep/off? I'm currently AirDroppping 3 very large files and I need to know if the files will continue to transfer while I'm not using one of the computers.\n\nA: It should work as long as you have Wake for network access enabled in  System Preferences → Energy Saver → Battery/Power Adapter.\nDepending on the capabilities of your Mac, the option's description may differ:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Wake for network access - Your Mac supports Wake on Demand over both Ethernet and AirPort\n  \n*Wake for Ethernet network access - Your Mac supports Wake on Demand over Ethernet only\n  \n*Wake for AirPort network access - Your Mac supports Wake on Demand over AirPort only\n[source]\n\nThe option \"wake for Ethernet network access\" is mentioned only to round up the answer. Wake on demand for ethernet will not help if your Macs communicate using Wi-Fi.\nHowever, you can enable AirDrop to communicate using Ethernet as well as explained here. This will also enable AirDrop on so-called unsupported Macs.\n\nA: No, AirDrop requires a user to be logged in, which obviously means booted.\n", "Q: Will a reset make my old iPad faster? I have an old iPad (the first generation), and over time it has become unbearably slow. Now I understand that I cannot expect apps designed for faster iPads to work perfectly on this old device. However, it often responds slowly even to trivial actions, such as typing. \nI have never reset an iOS device, and thus I am not sure if it would help. However, I have an Android device that gets an impressive performance boost once I reset it every now and then (the same can be said about most Windows devices, I guess). Thus, my question: does it make sense to try and reset my old iPad? Would it become more responsive, or should I be looking for issues elsewhere?\n\nA: I wouldn't expect it to be any faster, especially if you are comparing the performance increases of doing the same thing on an Android device.\nThe reason is that, on an iPad, Apple goes through a great deal of trouble to ensure that applications don't mess up your operating system (e.g. by using up too much resources in the background). Compare that with a Windows or Mac system where each application you install can load up its own background processes. In an environment such as that, you would expect a reset of the entire computer to speed everything up.\nThe only thing affecting your performance on the iPad, however, is iOS, which Apple provides. Assuming you reset to the same iOS you are currently using, you should expect the experience to be the same at the end.\nMy guess as to why your iPad is less responsive than it used to be is that Apple is optimizing their iOS updates for the newer generation iPad models rather than worrying about how it might affect the user experience on the 1st generation iPad.\nTherefore, I think the only thing that could potentially increase your performance is if you downgrade the iOS on your device (which is beyond the scope of this answer), or wait for Apple to release an update which fixes the issues you are experiencing (unlikely with older generation iPads). A final option might be to jailbreak and see if there are any solutions available there (I'm not familiar with jailbreaking, so I can't point to specifics).\nThe one caveat might be that you are running multiple applications (several of which may be consuming up resources). However, the fix for that is to simply shut them down rather than reseting the entire iOS.\n\nA: It is possible but not that likely. I have had a reset fix WiFi on an iOS device, but in general system management of processes is very strict. If an app is running in the background when it should not or is eating too much memory, it gets killed.\nYour question is very similar to Does an iPad consume more battery power when there are multiple applications open? - where using battery is pretty much the same thing as using system resources that could otherwise make your iPad faster. It's worth reading the replies and accepting that iOS just doesn't allow apps to run wild. A lot of people will say that killing applications helps, but it just isn't true.*\nIf you did reboot you would find the same apps in the task list. That's because it isn't a list of running apps, but of recently-used apps. Seeing them there means they might be running but they're probably not.\n*Why isn't it true? As the linked question and answers show, only a few limited use cases are allowed for an app to remain \"running\" in the background. If you have one of these active you will typically know about it and want that behaviour! If you don't you could shut it down but telling you to shut down those apps is a bit like telling you not to run any apps because they will run your battery down. The bottom line is that apps are NOT doing useless random things in the background and wasting your system resources.\n", "Q: How can I benchmark my new RAM? Based on the responses to my earlier question about memory replacement, I plan to upgrade soon.  That said, once I've acquired and installed said memory, what is the recommended Mac software I should use to burn in and test the new memory?  Are there any free options?\n\nA: I've always used Memtest86 on a bootable disk to do memory testing. Not sure what you mean by \"burn in\" though. Other than testing for stability, bad block and general good-functioning of your RAM there isn't anything else you need to do. Using the RAM doesn't actually make it perform any better or worse than when it was initially installed in your machine.\nBurn Memtest86 to a CD. Boot from the CD. Let it cycle through all your blocks and it will produce a report.\nThere's an OS X build of Memtest that's available through this OS X Daily article but I've never used it. Can't speak to how well it works.\nThere's also memtester and it's available as a Homebrew package:\n> brew info memtester\nmemtester 4.2.2\nhttp://pyropus.ca/software/memtester/\nNot installed\nhttps://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/memtester.rb\n\nTo install it:\n> brew install memtester\n\nAgain, haven't used it so I can't speak about how well it works, but it's a userspace program so it means you don't have to reboot your machine to get it to work. I'd probably start with that and if it doesn't give you a suitable report, move on to Memtest86 on a CD.\n\nA: XBench is a great free benchmarking software that'll show you ram speed under multiple conditions, such as random read, random write, sequential read, sequential write, etc. among other system benchmarks such as graphics card, cpu and storage access speed.\nGeek Bench is even better, but isn't free =/\n\nA: \nRember is a front-end GUI to the 'memtest' command line memory testing program.\n\nhttp://www.kelleycomputing.net/rember/\n", "Q: Specification of mid-2010 15\" MacBook Pro LCD panel?

If I have an iPod touch, which will only connect to the internet via Wifi, how will it work with email?  If I write an email on the bus, will it send when I get home?  If I check an email with an attachment, will it download the attachment when it's connected, so that I can read it offline?\n\nA: Yes. Email works well when not connected to internet.\nYou will get warnings that it cannot connect to your email accounts. One warning pops up for every email account that you have set up on your device (and possibly one for all the outgoing servers as well). After canceling all of these, you are home free.\nIf you send an email and are not connected to the internet, it will sit in the outbox, and should send automatically as soon as you reach wifi connectivity.

I always feel that using the default camera app provides the best results, however some camera apps contain features that I like (burst mode, etc.). I was wondering if apps such as Camera+ and Awesomize have an impact on the quality of photos?\n\nA: The quality should be exactly the same.  They both use the same API, so unless Apple applies some proprietary image algorithm on the picture, the source pixels are identical.\nHowever, when those apps use the \"burst\" mode, then the quality of course will be decreased because they are in effect decreasing the resolution of the image for faster capture.\n\nA: Any up-to-date camera app should have proper quality. However, I have noticed at least one camera app (I believe it was the two by Joby, Frame X Frame, and Gorillacam) that didn't seem to be optimized for the iPhone 4S's 8MP camera and instead used the quality level of the iPhone 4 - shooting 4MP photos. I've deleted both of those apps off so they may have changed something since then, but it has only been roughly a couple months since they were installed.\nAgain, they should have support, but not all do.\n", "Q: Using my iMac in a country with a different power supply standard We may be relocating to a different area of the world where the power standards and outlets differ considerably from what I've got here in North America.\nIs the power supply in my iMac auto-adjusting, universal? Can I just buy a new IEC cable for it to match the local plug standard and run it straight in to the wall? Or do I need a transformer?\nEdit: I have an older iMac. 2007. 2.8 GHz Core 2 Duo.\n\nA: Building on @penguinrob's answer, the specs for the 2007 iMac can be found on the Apple Support KB:\n\nElectrical and environmental requirements\nMeets ENERGY STAR requirements \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Line voltage: 100-240V \n  \n*AC Frequency:\n  50Hz to 60Hz, single phase \n  \n*Maximum continuous power: 200W (20-inch\n  models); 280W (24-inch model) \n  \n*Operating temperature: 50° to 95° F (10°\n  to 35° C) \n  \n*Storage temperature: -40° to 185° F (-40° to 85° C) \n  \n*Relative\n  humidity: 5% to 95% noncondensing \n  \n*Maximum altitude: 10,000 feet\n  \n\nIt looks like you should be able to get by with the IEC cable/adapter; the transformer can handle 100-240V, so you likely do not need an additional transformer.\n\nA: According to http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html (under Electrical and Operating Requirements), it specifies a line voltage of 100-240V AC, so if the country you're going to provides plugs with output in that voltage range, you should be fine.\nAccording to http://web.archive.org/web/20071025020751/http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html (snapshot of the imac tech specs page from October 2007, the same voltage requirements apply.\n\nA: It's not what you asked, but (at least some of) the G5 and G4 iMacs do not support different power supply standards.\nI know this, because a co-worker tried plugging a 120V one into a 240V UPS, and it almost caught fire.\nTo make the situation even more amusing/tragilarious, he did this twice. Only one of the computers he blew up was an iMac, though. \n\nA: No problem re getting an adapter and usung the iMac, BUT instead of directly into the wall, plug it into a power surge bar as some countries have more “ebb and flow” than in North Merica.\n", "Q: Multiple-partition hard drive on Airport Extreme Is there a way to have multiple partitions on a hard drive plugged into an Airport Extreme? I have a 3TB hard drive, and would like a 2TB partition for storage, time machine backups (mac formatted), and then a 1TB ntfs formatted for stuff accessible to windows computers. However, if I have more than one partition, the disk doesn't show up at all in Airport Utility or in Finder. Is there a way around this limitation?\n\nA: No, this isn't possible. According to Apple Support:\n\nTime Machine can’t back up to an external disk connected to an AirPort\n  Extreme, or to an iPod, iDisk, or disk formatted for Windows.\n\nHowever, the same KB also notes that:\n\nYou can use Time Machine with a Time Capsule, and with USB, FireWire,\n  and Thunderbolt disks. The backup disk can be directly connected to\n  your computer or be on a network. If the backup disk has been divided\n  into partitions, you can use one of the partitions.\n\nYou just can't have that drive hooked up to the Airport Extreme.\n", "Q: Making Time Machine Backups while Mac is in Sleep Mode I'd like my Mac to be able to save a Time Machine backup even when I have it in sleep mode. Is there a way I can have my Mac wake up at a certain time automatically in order for Time Machine to run?\n\nA: You can schedule your Mac to wake from sleep or boot at a specific time. Go to System Preferences, then the Energy Saver pane. In there, at the bottom-right, is a \"Schedule…\" button. Pressing it brings up a sheet where you can set a day and time to wake up and another to go to sleep. If you leave a half-hour or so between the wake up and sleep times, it should have enough time to back up.\nI must say, there's not much point in running a Time Machine backup when you haven't been using the computer: if you're not using it, nothing has changed, so there's nothing new to back up. I should also note that if the computer is shut down (like if you're on vacation) it'll boot and then go to sleep if you don't turn the schedule off before you leave.\n\nA: According to Apple Support:\n\nIf your computer is in sleep or your backup disk isn’t available when it’s time for a scheduled backup, the backup is not performed.\n  Backups resume after the computer and backup disk are available again.\n\nIf your Mac is scheduled to wake from sleep (as noted in @CajunLuke's answer), you'd need to create an Automator script to immediately trigger the Time Machine backup upon waking, or wait an hour or so to catch the hourly TM backup.\n\nA: Try Time Machine Editor in conjunction with System Preferences > Energy Saver > Schedule Wakeup.\n", "Q: How do you customize Lion Finder sidebar icons? I'm not looking to hack resources or use SIMBL plugins, but I would like to be able to show custom icons in the Lion sidebar.\nAs far as I've understood custom icons on the folder no longer show up in the sidebar and the \"built-in\" icons that are there are hardcoded to resources pathed in: /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources\nHowever, I notice that the new versions of Dropbox now update the \"Dropbox\" sidebar icon to be a custom icon and it seems to be able to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Without using some code injection thing like SIMBL or needing root access\n\n*Without the actual Dropbox process being running\n\n\nSo this leads me to believe that Lion sidebar icons are customisable, but this metadata is stored elsewhere?\nxattr -l ~/Dropbox doesn't seem to list anything interesting:\ncom.apple.FinderInfo:\n00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020\n\n\nA: There's a good topic on this over at StackOverflow \nThe gist of how Dropbox does it is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*injecting code into the mach_kernel so that it's not dependant on Dropbox running\n\n\nSo the answer is probably no, you can't do it without using code injection, but this may change in the future, or not as the case may be.\n", "Q: Export iTunes music library information (album, artist, track names) to CSV or spreadsheet format? Is there a way to export album/track information from an iTunes music library into, say, a comma-separated values (CSV) file, or another spreadsheet-friendly format?\nI'd like to be able to grab a snapshot of at least basic metadata – being artist name, album name, and track name – and copy into a spreadsheet or database software for reference, cleansing, & analysis.  (If you want to call me a music nerd for wanting to data-mine information about my CD collection, go right ahead! :-)\nIs there a way to do such a metadata export within iTunes itself, or else might there be a third-party tool that can extract such information from iTunes library storage?  Or perhaps you have a quick & dirty homebrew script of your own you could share here?\nI'm aware there is XML somewhere in the bowels of my iTunes library, and I'm a programming nerd too, but I'm hoping somebody has already invented this particular wheel.\nThanks!\n\nA: For enhancements/tools to work with ITunes probably the first place to go is \nDoug's Applescripts for iTunes. There are many useful scripts here.\nOn the page for Exporting Info there is this script that exports track information as a text file.\n\nThis script will write a discrete alphabetical list of your choice of the Albums, Artists, Album Artists, Composers, Genres, Shows, or Track Names in iTunes to a text file.\n\n\nA: Make sure all the columns you want metadata for are visible in the playlist or library you're looking at. Then, select the tunes you want with shift-click or ⌘-click or whatever:\n\nThen, hit ⌘+C to copy. This will allow you to paste what's visible in the iTunes playlist into any sort of spreadsheet you like:\n\nIt won't label the columns for you, but it'll do the trick quickly.\n\nA: You can do File -> Library -> Export Library and get an XML file of your library metadata. From there it would be a relatively straightforward matter for a programmer to convert the XML data into a CSV, spreadsheet, or database.\nFor example, I made this quick Ruby script in about 10 minutes to get the artist, album, and track names from the XML and output a CSV. Note that it will only match tracks that have all 3 pieces of info provided, and that it requires the library file to be called \"Library.xml\" in the current directory:\nrequire 'csv'\n\ntrack = /<key>Name<\\/key><string>(.*)<\\/string>[.\\s]*<key>Artist<\\/key><string>(.*)<\\/string>[.\\s]*<key>Album<\\/key><string>(.*)<\\/string>/\n\nfile = File.open(\"Library.xml\", \"r\")\ncontents = file.read\n\nout = CSV.open(\"Library.csv\", \"w\")\n\ncontents.scan(track) do |match|\n  out << match\nend\n\n\nA: One more option: exiftool will also extract ID3 tags from music files.  One of its many options is to put them in a CSV file, one line per input file.  You can also limit which tags it will pull.\n\nA: One way to do this is to make a playlist with all your songs in it. Then you export the playlist as a text file. Next drag the text file into Excel and all your information should be organized. You can then save the excel sheet as a csv.\n", "Q: How to specify that cover art for a video in iTunes should be a frame from a specific time in the video? When I add a movie or other video to iTunes, it appears that iTunes selects a video frame from somewhere near the beginning of the video file as the default cover art — and most of the time this is a terrible choice.\nMany of the shows and movies in my collection have an opening sequence containing frames where a title is plainly shown (e.g. \"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\"), or at least there's some scene in the video which is distinct & identifiable, a scene I would clearly recognize when scrolling through my collection with the Cover Flow view.\nI'd like to specify such a distinct frame, from an arbitrary point in a video, as a video's cover art.  I expected a slider somewhere to seek through a video and find just the right spot to use as cover, but I didn't find such functionality.\n\n\n*\n\n*How does iTunes determine which frame to select for the cover art from a video?\n\n*Is there a way to tell iTunes to use a different video frame as the cover art?\n\n*Failing that, what is a good alternative?\nThank you.\n\nA: The frame that's used is called the \"Poster Frame\". It looks like iTunes chooses a frame 10 seconds into the video by default.\nTo choose a specific frame as the cover art:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start playing the video.\n\n*Pause the video on the frame you want to use.\n\n*Right-click on the video and choose \"Set Poster Frame\".\n", "Q: FaceTime Front Camera Image Flickers I have an iPhone 4S 32 GB model.  It is not jailbroken, and I do not have any camera-specific apps installed.\nSometimes when I switch between front and rear cameras during a FaceTime session, upon switching back to the front camera the image that I am sending will either be flickering (occasional black frames) or it will be completely black.  This is confirmed both by me as well as the viewer on the other end.  Only by switching between cameras a second time can I get this problem to go away.\nIs there a known bug/cause for this problem, or is it something I am doing wrong myself?\n\nA: Problems like this are most likely in the software of the iPhone. When it happens with a MacBook camera, you can fix it most of the times by dumping the PRAM upon starting your computer (command option P R), but that's not possible on your iPhone of course. You can however try to simply reboot your iPhone, and that might even fix the problem. You reach the off-switch by holding the sleep/wake-button for several seconds.\nIf that doesn't work, we'll reach the next step for fixing most software-related problems: restoring your iPhone's software (what does not mean that you have to get rid of all your personal data). simply let iTunes run a full backup first, then click the restore-button on you iPhone information screen in iTunes. After restoring you will be asked if you want to put your data back, and the problem will probably be fixed.\nIf that does not fix your problem you might want to consider taking your iPhone to a Genius Bar (if available in your area) or send it back for repairs (if you are still in your warranty period). \n", "Q: What properties must an iPhone case have to avoid antenna issues? I have an AT&T iPhone 4, which may have antenna problems when held in some positions (i.e. the \"grip of death\").  To help with this, Apple gave away bumper cases which worked around the problems when the phones were new.  Unfortunately, my old iPhone case broke, so now I'm looking at new cases. \nWhat properties must my new case have to be to avoid these problems with the iPhone 4's antenna? \n\nA: A piece of non-conductive scotch tape is all that is required to prevent your skin from bridging the gap in the metal band and changing the impedance of the antennas.\nAs long as your skin doesn't short the external metal band, you are good to go, so even extremely thin gloves that are dry would work without any case whatsoever.\nFor more reading, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*PC World: Apple Responds to iPhone 4 Antenna Problem \n\n*Apple PR: Letter from Apple Regarding iPhone 4 \n\n*Apple Support: iPhone 4: Antenna or reception issues \n\n*Antenna Engineer Blog: Apple iPhone 4 Antennas...\n\nA: The only thing that matters is electrical isolation. A thin layer of non-conductive tape would probably be fine. It is not the distance from your skin but the possibility of your slightly-conductive fingers (depending on personal skin type, sweatiness, humidity etc.) bridging the electrically-insulated gap in the metal band antenna that causes a slight degradation in phone reception on the iPhone 4.\nAs long as the case stops your fingers from touching the metal I'd say any case is fine.\nThe AnandTech review of the iPhone 4 shows the actual metal pieces that function as the antenna. It is important for antennas to be the correct length to function correctly for the band they are designed to send or receive. If you bridge the gap then you change the effective length of the pieces of metal, and that's the first problem. The second problem is that you are electrically connecting a pair of circuits that are not designed to be connected. Your skin acts as a resistor of some finite value, electrically speaking. A gap, or insulation, is an infinite resistance.\nThe reason that the iPhone 4S does not have this issue is that it has two separate antennae for each band (a \"diversity antenna\" setup) and the phone will dynamically use whichever antenna has the best signal at any time. It is much harder for you to bridge all the gaps when you hold the phone in your hand so you can get by without a case with a 4S.\n", "Q: What programs have trouble with case-sensitive (HFSX) filesystems, and how to fix them? There are some programs that require a case-sensitive filesystem, and others that require case-insensitive. Even though Apple warns against using case sensitive file systems, in some situations it is useful.\nWhat programs have trouble with Case Sensitive (HFSX) systems?\nWhat are the work-arounds?\nIn general, the problem is that the developers have a file in their app called FOO, but try to access the file by the name foo. In an HFS+ system that is case preserving but case insensitive, searching for foo will find FOO. That is not the case in HFSX. The general solution is therefore to \n\n\n*\n\n*Find the misnamed file or folder\n\n*Make a copy, a link, or rename so the expected name is found\n\n\nA: According to this question, Photoshop CS5 won't work on HFSX.\nConvert a partition from case-sensitive to case-insensitive\n\nA: MeshLab version 1.3.2 does not work on HSFX systems. The CFBundleExecutable in Info.plist specifies MeshLab, but the binary in the Contents/MacOS folder is meshlab. The solution is to edit Info.plist (change MeshLab to meshlab) or:\ncd meshlab.app/Contents/MacOS\nln -s meshlab MeshLab\n\nA bug report has been filed here: https://sourceforge.net/p/meshlab/bugs/323/\n\nA: Thing (beta, 1.6b24) does not work with HSFX.

The application itself seems to work, so I created a case-insensitive data volume and moved my OneDrive folder there.\nVersion: 19.192.0926.0012\nNote: I’m using APFS not HFS+ but I think they will cause same issues.\n\nA: Steam\n\nI then put the path on a case-insensitive filesystem, but the program exits after update. I then tried manually run the binary from command line (to see whether it provides more detailed error message):\n/Applications/Steam.app/Contents/MacOS/steam_osx\n\nRunning this twice and it works. Note that the log is different, so it definitely did something different the second time, even though it looks the same in GUI.\nNote: this doesn’t mean that all games work. It’s only about Steam itself.\n\nA: The CrashPlan backup software (v 3.6.3) has a known case sensitive issue.\nSolution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal \n\n*Stop the CrashPlan service by entering this command:\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist\n\n*Open the CrashPlan plist file by entering this command:\nsudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist\n\n*Enter your password for the computer when prompted \n\n*Locate the following string:\n<string>/Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents/MacOs/CrashPlanService</string>\n\n*Update it to (note capital s on MacOS):\n<string>/Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents/MacOS/CrashPlanService</string>\n\n*Press Control+X to exit \n\n*Press Y to confirm the changes \n\n*When you see the prompt File Name to Write, press Enter to save to the existing location \n\n*Start the CrashPlan service by typing: \nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist\n", "Q: Do computers slow down as they age? I have an eMac I bought in 2004. I just used the system restore CD to re-install Panther, iLife '04, Internet Explorer for Mac(!), etc. I don't have any timed specs from \"back then\", so I can't answer this definitively, but the machine feels slower than I remember it feeling back in the good old days.\n\nIf my hard drive has been purged of all the cruft that accumulates over time, should the computer run as snappily as it did when it was new? Are perceived differences in speed due psychological, to comparisons to more modern hardware, or do systems slow as they age for reasons (physical degradation?) other than the accumulation of contents on the system drive?\n\nA: Things that might physically slow an \"old\" computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drive fragmentation. Should not be an issue if you reinstall from scratch.\n\n*Flaky hard drive sectors. Difficulty reading and/or writing sectors causing retries would definitely slow things down, although perhaps not in a uniform way. You might try zeroing the drive to force spare sectors to come online, but all drives will fail eventually.\n\n*Flaky optical drives. Optical drives have reliability slightly better than tissue paper it seems.\n\n*Thermal control. Something with the fans, heat sinks, etc is not working properly or optimally, causing the CPU or some other component to automatically ratchet down. It might be something as simple as dust in the intakes or on the heat sink fins.\n\n\nIf this was a machine with a BIOS, a battery failure might cause the default settings to take effect, which might not be optimal. Dunno if a Mac's NVRAM is fraught with the same peril.\n\nA: No. Most workloads, the processor is what governs performance and the CPU itself remains measurably stable over time in terms of clock rate.\n\nThe OS and memory and storage are largely stable. Storage would be the first thing to slow with age, so benchmark that if you can. \nOur expectations of what make for a fast computer however do not slow down. Camera resolution grows, image fidelity grows, more logic is stuffed into a web page, etc...\nSoftware can become corrupt over time, but the computer itself can be returned to factory conditions with an easy erase and install to confirm that the hardware is still speedy even if we don't feel it's so fast compared to all the new young gun computers that are now shipping.\n\nNow from a purely analytical standpoint, here are the items that could conceivably be measured in benchmark or manufacturer tests:\n\n\n*\n\n*Heat Dissipation failures (thermal grease drying out or dust/worse accumulation) could cause CPU temps to rise when airflow can't remove enough heat from the chipsets. Older CPU didn't throttle as much and had larger metal traces to get the heat out. Newer CPU like the MacBook Air actively reduce cores and clock cycles to thermally control the CPU. This makes for a very noticeable performance dip when the CPU cannot be kept cool. I have seen tower and iMac cases packed with dust or worse / nicotine tar laden dust. So much so, that the computer had no business even running by the looks of it - but other than hot sensors, most still ran full speed (to my great astonishment).\n\n*Hard Drive imminent failures - the expected bad block relocation behavior when a drive has to take more time to land data can be noticeable, but I categorize that as your computer has a bad drive - not that it's old and slow. This can happen to a brand new computer with a bad drive until it triggers the SMART status or just fails outright.\n\nA: Most of the time when a computer seems to have gotten slower, software is to blame.\nFrequently lots of applications have been installed over the years and a computer has become cluttered with login items and background processes. Even when the offending apps are no longer in use, their daemons and updaters can stay alive.\nWhen this happens, the computer really does slow down. Disused apps living in the background and competing for resources takes away from the OS and the apps you really do want to use and can slow things down. The more of this 'crud' that builds up, the slower the system can feel.\nContributing to the problem, hard drives do slow down a little bit as they fill up. If so many apps have been installed and files have been saved that the computer is seriously low on free space, performance can be impacted.\nThe other major component of this is that, as it is updated, software gets more and more complex and requires better and better hardware. When an app is updated, frequently it has some new features that take more power to run. Think about how OS X has gradually had more animation, graphics, and background functions added. The extra tax of having something like Autosave running constantly in the background could seriously impact a very old system, and something like Mission Control could be completely impossible.\nHowever, since you've completely purged your system, none of these things are affecting you.\nHard drives do not really slow down over time; either they keep working well or they fail completely. See this Super User post for more details.\nThe same goes for other components: they keep working much the same until they die.\nIt is entirely possible that your expectations are playing a role here.\nTasks that would be strenuous on your eMac are trivial to your current computer, so you expect them to be instant. When they're not (because the computer has to work harder to get them done), it feels slow.\nThe other potential factor is the fact that (even though you're using old software) you're interacting with things that have been updated and are expecting users to be on newer systems.\nWeb pages have more images, JavaScript, and AJAX calls then they did in 2004, all of which take power to run. Images, videos, and music are recorded at higher resolutions and stored in less-compressed/higher-fidelity/more CPU intensive formats. Text documents are trending to become richer and have more formatting and metadata without considering that more media is likely to be embedded into them.\nSo, here's the test: If your recently-wiped computer feels slower when using the same apps, files, and websites you used in 2004, your expectations have changed. \nOtherwise I would be inclined to blame crud, software surpassing hardware, the hard drive filling up, and interacting with newer resources (in that order).\n\nA: Although computers/processors slow down over time aka transistor aging, the slowing effect felt by the user is in fact because of the software updates and getting used to faster computers.\n\nA: Stob's Index Of Cruftitude may help. Humour obviously, but with a grain of truth.\n", "Q: How do I revert the default mail client back to Mail from GMail? I downloaded Google Chrome and it automatically changed my default mail reader from Mail to GMail in Chrome. I went to the preferences section of Mail and didn't see an option to make Mail the default reader.\n\nA: This can be disabled in Google Chrome. Go to Settings, then select \"Show Advanced Settings...\" at the bottom of the page. Click \"Content Settings\", and click \"Manage Handlers\" under the \"Handlers\" heading. Under \"Active protocol handlers\", change mailto to \"None\".\nThen go into Mail.app and into Preferences -> General, and make sure \"Default E-mail Reader\" to \"Mail\"\n\nA: In theory, it should work as described above. But for me it didn't, so I used RCDefaultApps prefpane to restore the handler for mailto back to Mail.app (on Snow Leopard).\n", "Q: Can I get iPhone charge status from my Mac? I have my iPhone plugged into my Mac via USB. Is there anyway to check on the charge status? I know iTunes does give you a small battery indicator, but I am looking for something a bit more detailed, like % charge.  \nI thought it is something nice to have and I am a bit lazy to reach for my iPhone to check every time I charge my phone.\n\nA: You are able to see the charge status on the iPhone page on the new iTunes 11.\n\nA: Well, it's really quite janky, but one option may be to install Reflection, have the iPhone set to mirror to Reflection, and call it a day.  You're going to want to use a charge cable here since this drains the battery right quick.\nIt doesn't currently support this use-case, but the Apple Configurator does have a monitoring section that probably will support battery-level monitoring at some point.\nReally though?  I'd get iStat for iPhone and set up the device on a dock.  It's got a nice big battery monitor.\n\nA: It's definitely possible to get this information as you get a % charged figure for the iPhone when you plug it into a machine running Linux.\n\nA: You can see it using this app I think: https://www.fadel.io/batteries (mentioned here).\n\nA: The answer is no.  See, the battery in your phone is connected to the \"motherboard\" of your iphone. Think of it as the battery is only working for the iphone.  \nWhen you plug your phone in via USB, you can't access the information about the battery from your computer because of this. \n", "Q: Downloading Xcode libraries with slow internet connection I need to find the link to install the Xcode 4.3 developer library (237 MB) and the iOS 5.1 Library (Apple iPhone OS 5.1) (395 MB).\nSince I have a slow internet connection, I am unable to download it from my Xcode, so I will have to download it from another machine and copy it to my Mac.\nSo, does anyone here know the direct link to the above downloads?\nNote: I am running OS 10.7.3 and my Xcode version is 4.3.1.\n\nA: Sorry, you cannot do it, or at least not in a way that would pay off.\nI would be much easier to go with your laptop to a McDonalds and get it from there.\nTrust me, I've been there ;)\n\nA: One method that might work is to install xCode completely on a machine with a fast internet connection, then copy thedeveloper directory and a few other directories over to the new machine.

Is there any way, short of entering the URL bar (either with a mouse or with ⌘+L and pressing return), to reload the page without resending the form?\n\nA: Strictly speaking, no.  For simple HTML forms using Common Gateway Interface (CGI), the web page you see is the output of a process which uses the form data as an input.  Put another way, the server needs the form data to generate the page.  There a lot of ways to get around that using back-end databases, cookies, javascript, etc.  But generally speaking: no-form, no-result.\nYou mentioned clicking in the URL bar and pressing return, but if the form uses the GET method (form data in the URL itself), then clicking in the URL bar and pressing return does effectively resend it.  However, if the form uses the POST method (form data sent in the HTTP request body), then clicking the URL bar and pressing will not send the form data and so the page will not be regenerated.\nNote that if you tell Safari to reload a form-result page, it will usually ask you to confirm that you really want to do that, then resend the form data.  The reason it asks is that there may well be some side-effect of the form (like charging your credit card) which you might not want to repeat.

In short, how do I make a Keynote template/theme with custom data (unique to that presentation) shown on every slide, and also support masters for a variety of layouts, without the author needing to edit every master every time they start a new presentation.\nFrom this question on setting a common background for all masters, I can see that Keynote does not provide the same \"Inheritance of Masters\" feature that Powerpoint provides, so every Master is effectively starting from scratch, and each slide can only use a single master as its base.\nMy problem with this is that I want to make a template for my organisation that includes the following metadata on most (or all, if need be) slides:\n\n\n*\n\n*A company logo — an image, but the same every time\n\n*The presenter's name — different for each person\n\n*A name for the presentation / event — different for each file\n\n*Logos/names of collaborators/sponsors/etc — often different for each file\nThe problem seems to be that Keynote uses masters for slide layout as well as the theme, without allowing any separation of the two.\nIf users are to have an easy way of getting a Title Page / Section Title / Single column slide / Two-column slide / etc, each of these need to be a fully unique master, with all the above information on it. This means the user needs to add their name + event name + logos to every single master, each time they start a new presentation. And if they miss one, then it won't be obvious but a few slides here and there (with that particular master) will have the wrong metadata.\n\nExpected Solutions — I'd expect Keynote to support something like the following, but it does not seem to...\nPages has a feature that lets you \"merge\" information into the document (e.g. custom fields or from address book), which would be perfect for this, because you'd just set the metadata for the file once and never have to touch masters.\nPowerpoint offers \"hierarchical\" or \"inherited\" masters (not sure exactly what they call it), which means you can put the basic info common to everything on a single master, and then set up layout slides based on that master, so changing the event or author is at least a single edit of the master(s).\nAnother method I can imagine would be to allow multiple masters applied to a single slide, so you apply the base for the metadata and then a layout master for the arrangement of titles/columns/images/etc.\n\nKeynote does not seem to provide any of these methods of achieving this... Have I missed something? This seems like a pretty poor design of slide masters to me. I'm hoping that this is just a case of Apple being too minimalistic in their design for me to have picked up the subtle, elegant solution... but would have expected it to match Pages so am not very hopeful.\n\nA: I ran into this same problem and spent two days searching for it.\nMy eventual answer:  Install VirtualBox.  In a virtual machine install windows XP, then install office and power point.  This also gave me Access, an applicationf or which there is no good mac equivalent.\n", "Q: Is there a way to re-order a playlist? I have an existing playlist in iTunes, and I'd like to move some tracks to the top.  But when I drag them up, the cursor get a \"+\", and the tracks don't stay where I put them.  How can I move these tracks around in a playlist?\nIn case it matters, I'm using iTunes (v10.6.0.40) a Windows 7 PC. \n\nA: You need to switch to list view to reorder songs in a playlist. To switch to list view click the list view button in the upper left hand side of the top of the iTunes windows:\n\nOnce you've switch to list view you need to make sure your items are sorted by track number (click the top of the the first column). Then you can drag tracks around in the playlist to reorder them. For example, I switch Planet Earth and The Valley in the playlist shown above by clicking on Planet Earth and dragging it up above The Valley and then releasing my mouse button:\n\nEdit: I just tried this in iTunes on Windows and I think I see where you're getting the + from. It's actually okay -- just keep dragging. Apparently the + is the cursor icon Apple chose for a grab action on song (or a list of songs). I have no way to take a screen shot of what's happening, but I can definitely reorder songs in Windows by clicking and dragging when in list view. Same as on OS X.\n", "Q: Why is Apple hardware test (AHT) not loading when pressing key D on system start? I purchased a Late-2011 MacBook Pro 15\" used a month ago. At the time of purchase, I successfully ran the Apple Hardware Test.\nI've since installed a new SSD and aftermarket RAM. The computer appears to be functioning normally (I'm typing this post on it), but I'd like to run the full hardware test to verify everything is OK.\nBut I can't seem to get it to load into the hardware test.  I've tried holding down D before pressing the power button on as well as right before the grey screen comes up. I'm confused because I've done this before without any problems.\nIs there something obvious I'm doing wrong or is there a way I can check for problems that would stop the AHT from starting?\n\nAdditional info by @gentmatt:\nThe last time I have performed the Apple Hardware Test, my MacBook Pro was running 10.7.2. As of today, I'm running 10.7.3.\nThe AHT loaded even after I had installed my custom SSD and RAM. But not this time.\n\nA: Same thing here (similar model MBP, same mods). Learned that Option+D does the trick. However, if you get what I see, the AHT fires up and then says that it doesn't support this model of machine. No funny business, it's an Apple MBP (no hackintosh here), but I added a OCZ Vertex 3 and I've tried pre-8GB RAM kit (stock) and post, no difference.\n\nA: Pressing ⌥+D right after pressing the power button and before the gray screen appears works on my late-2011 15\" MBP. This forces an internet-based hardware test, which will work even if you've lost the the local hardware test software. (It will probably work over WiFi, but you have more chance of success with ethernet.)\n\nA: Its Option + D that works for me.  Macbook Pro, Late 2011 model running Mavericks.\n\nA: I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro 13\", which I first replaced the hard drive (totally blank and repartitioned), then installed Mountain Lion, then upgraded to Mavericks.  \nThere appear to be two parts to the problem:\n1) Swapping out a raw hard drive causes the loss of a hidden diagnostics/recovery partition (that I never bothered to look for, and which doesn't appear to be visible using Disk Utility.\n2) The Apple KB article for Apple Hardware Test - http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257 - appears to be incorrect.  The correct sequence to invoke the AHT is:\nOPTION-D during a restart.\nPerforming a restart and holding OPTION-D eventually produced a \"Internet Recovery\" screen, and then automatically started the AHT by itself (the quaint, OS9-styled screen).  \n\nA: Click on your embedded link again - the answer is just beyond the instructions for the \"normal\" startup method that you've been unsuccessful with:\n\nAdditional Information\n  Apple Hardware Test is included on the DVDs that are shipped with some Macintosh computers. If the copy on your hard drive becomes unavailable, use the DVDs to run Apple Hardware Test. \n\nThat should get you going. \nIf you are running Lion and do not have install DVDs, try re-installing your old RAM (assuming you have it) and running AHT. \n\nA: Just to check, do you have internet access when you are doing the hardware test?  According to you link\n\nAn Internet-enabled connection via Ethernet or Wi-Fi is required to use this feature.\n\n\nA: Had the same problem listed here on my iMac Pro, and it turns out that if you have a firmware password set, then the hardware diagnostics system won't work at all, and there is no indication of this, but a nice fellow named Felix from Apple was able to suss that out with me.\nTo disable firmware password or check its status, you need to restart the system while holding down Cmd+R. Note: If a firmware password is set, a screen will show and ask you to input the password. Once you do that, you're greeted with various options like Disk Utility or Install macOS. Ignore them and follow the instructions below:\n\n*\n\n*Select Utilities > Startup Security Utility from the menu bar\n\n*Select Enter macOS Password and enter your Mac’s admin password (for newer macs/macOS)\n\n*Select Turn Off Firmware Password\n\n*Enter the current firmware password\n\n*Exit the Startup Security Utility.\n\n*Open the Apple menu and select Restart to exit macOS Recovery.\n\n\nA: The Apple KB article is inaccurate. After many unsuccessful attempts to launch the Apple Hardware Test on my MacBook Pro Early 2011 15\",I discovered you need to hold Command + D during startup, not just D.\n\nA: Most Early Macs - PRE 2011 or 10.6.3 White Retail Disk(one that came w/your Mac)\ninstalled FIRST..BEFORE Booting up w/D-Key pressed!\n\nA: I ran into similar situation with my mid 2011 mac-mini (with non mac keyboard/mouse & aftermarket updated RAM). After pressing 'D' at startup it searches for internet, eventually asking to select wi-fi connection (no available connections displayed though). There's an option to specify wi-fi access point name & password but for me after putting the credentials the wait icon just kept revolving.\nThankfully, I got it working using the ethernet cable.\n\nA: Struck out with \"D\" and command+D. Option+D worked for me, too.  Late 11 MacBook Pro 15. \n\nA: Alt+D using a Windows keyboard.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem whilst trying to run tests on a second hand Mac mini (Late 2014).  I tried holding D, alt-D, cmd-D, cmd-R, alt-cmd-R, and two different wired keyboards, but each time the machine would just boot to the normal login screen.\nI then reset the SMC (on this machine: unplug power cord, wait 15 secs, replug, wait 5 secs, power on - see Apple's HT201295).  And now alt-D boots to Apple Diagnostics (which has replaced AHT for this model), as expected.  Also, alt-cmd-R now boots to Internet Recovery (this key combination was also previously being ignored).\nPerhaps here, the SMC was holding onto network information from the previous owner and getting thrown by the different network environment in my house until it was reset.  Disappointing there were no error messages if that is the case.\n\nA: Mid 2012 MBP here. Just bought it and wanted to run AHT. Tried D, CMD D and OPT D, all bring same thing: \"Internet Recovery\". I have ethernet cable plugged in but it ignores that and wants wifi password (grr). I enter wifi password, then it connects but bugs out with black screen error: https://postimg.cc/HVq0fbZp\n(The machine has had an SSD installed and 1TB HDD in drive caddy). \nHoping someone can suggest anything. I really want to verify the hardware is good before I commit to keeping this machine. thanks\n", "Q: Delay in receiving messages in iMessage on iPhone 4S I have an iPhone 4S, and I've noticed a delay receiving messages. When I've noticed the problem, I've always been on 3G, not Wi-Fi.\nI'll generally notice this when 5 or 6 messages in a conversation come in at the same time. From there, everything seems to be real-time with no problems.\nI've considered that maybe my 3G service was just inconsistent and is down when the messages are delayed, but my understanding is that if 3G isn't available, the messages will come in as regular SMS.\nAnyone heard of this problem, or have any ideas on how I can troubleshoot?\n\nA: This issue could be caused by a lot of causes.   \nTo start with, it could be a matter of poor data coverage. If you experience the delays at the same time of the day at the same place, maybe that spot isn't that well covered and you just have bad luck receiving messages over there. So if you are always on the same spot, try a different one.\nIt could also be a connection error. Do you experience the problems when one particular person sends you messages, or with everyone? And do they experience delays too when you send messages to them?\nIt could be a malfunctioning 3G. Try to turn off 3G (if you can) and just use GPRS. There have been reports iMessages didn't work out well on 3G, but on GPRS it worked like a charm (it doesn't make any sense to turn off and on 3G just to send iMessages, but at least you'll figure out the cause).\nAnd the last, and probably the most unliky cause, could be an issue at the Apple servers. It happens sometimes, when those things get really busy, they protect themselves and spread the work over time. As I said, it's very unlikely, but it happens.\nAnd to answer your second question; yes indeed. If iMessages fails to send, your iPhone will try to send it as an SMS. You can activate this function at 'General < Messages < Send as SMS'\n", "Q: Auto-launch apps at iDevice startup In another question I asked, Graeme suggested using alternatives like Skype instead of FaceTime for its support for audio-only calls. \nSkype has the advantage of being cross-platform, but is there a way in which I could actually make Skype auto-login when my iPad starts, and keep it running continuously like FaceTime? Or is this functionality restricted to in-built apps only?\n\nA: Skype is a VOIP app so it is in the class of apps that actually do run in the background. However you need to start it manually. There's no facility in iOS to start a non-Apple app every time the device starts.\n\nA: Auto-launch app: \n    To use the features of the External Accessory framework, you must add ExternalAccessory.framework to your Xcode project and waitting for Accessory send RequestAppLaunch IAP2 control message, but it needed a Accessory with MFi.\n", "Q: Where is \"search\" on the iPod nano 6th gen? I just won a 6th generation iPod nano at an auction, so I didn't get the box or the instructions. I've mostly figure it out, except I can't figure out where they hid search. I had it on my old nano and it was handy. Is there some arcane double tap or funky gesture I need to use? Unfortunately, trying to search for \"search\" on the web hasn't been super fruitful.\n\nA: It looks like this iPod doesn't have this feature: it's not mentioned in the manual (http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iPod_nano_6thgen_User_Guide.pdf) - even in the index.  \nHowever, you can go to all items starting with a certain letter.

However, I want to establish some minimum requirements for it.\nThus, I need a slow Mac. However, I don't have access to a slow Mac that has a modern browser (IE 9+, Safari 5+, Opera 11+, Chrome, Firefox 4+).\nUsing the tool mentioned in this question, I can simulate a slow Internet connection. I can use up plenty of memory easily. However, I have no clue how to simulate a slow CPU without resorting to underclocking.\nIs there any way I can make my Mac's CPU slower temporarily without underclocking?\n\nA: One solution is to use virtualization to have another instance of Mac OS X running on your computer. Many virtualization applications (such as Parallels Desktop) let you decide how much resources an instance can have (e.g. memory or cpu). Lion increased its support of virtualizing Mac OS X.\nIf you do decide to go with Parallels, there's a useful how to article describing how to set up an instance of another Mac OS X Lion.\n\nA: A good way is to use the command-line utility cputhrottle, which allows you to set a cap to how much CPU a given process is allowed to use.\nInstall it with (for instance) brew: brew install cputhrottle\nThen choose how much processor percentage the process for your browser (and/or your browser tab content process) can use: cputhrottle <PID> <PERCENTAGE>.\nYou can find the process ID using the Activity Monitor app. \nTo terminate cputhrottle (which actively throttles the process for as long as it's running), press Control-C.\n\nA: You could always install OS X in a virtual machine and set the virtual machine to have a slower processor, perhaps.\n\nA: Run a few instances of yes > /dev/null &. Each instance will peg a core to 100%, so run one for each core. You could also try re-niceing the yes processes to a higher priority or lowering the priority the browser.\n\nA: Add sleep cycles to the main loop or parts of the code that runs often is a good first step. Next, add some calculations that are slow / irrelevant. Depending on what you want to stress, you can also so some awkward pointer math or casting of variables to slow things down. This is an easy thing to sandbag when programming.\n", "Q: How can I use a secondary axis in Numbers? One of my main problems with Numbers is the fact that it has much less of the functionality of Excel. That's why I barely use Numbers.\nOne of the main things that I always thought impossible was plotting two axes on one graph. This is my main reason for my dislike of Numbers.\nNow that many other interesting questions that I didn't think had answers are getting answered, I thought I might ask this question:\nHow can I plot two lines on one graph using a secondary axis in Numbers?\n\nA: Yes Numbers does now supports two axes. Steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the chart, change the type to 2D 2-Axis\n\n*Make sure you have more than one data series selected.\n\n*The Series tab for each data series will allow you select which axis to use for each series and the type: columns, lines or areas.\n\n*The chart Axis tab contains (Y1) and (Y2) tabs which you can customise.\n\n\nIf you are familiar with customising graphs in Numbers - it isn't complicated.\n\nA: If you want a line graph with 2 y-axes. You to insert->Chart-> 2-Axis. Put in your data. One of the sets will be a line the others a bar. The way to fix that is: Select the one that is a bar then to go to the Inspector-> Chart-> Series. It will say series type-> select that and change it from bar to line. Right below that it says plot on: There you can determine if you want that line to be plotted on y(1) or y(2).\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, Numbers' only solution is the 2D 2-axis graph which has categorical x-axis values. If you want to retain a numerical x-axis, the best way I've found is actually to lay two graphs over the top of each other.\nStep 1\nCreate two separate graphs of the same size and the same x-axis extents. Style them as you wish, but only add grid lines, axis lines and x-axis labels to one of them.\n\nStep 2\nThis is the worst bit. Because the y-axis cannot be moved, use control-command-shift-4 to copy a screenshot of the secondary y-axis to the clipboard. Paste with command-v. Make sure the \"Zoom\" level in Numbers is set to 100%, otherwise the pasted image will need to be resized.\nStep 3\nTurn off the axis labels on the secondary y-axis, then lay the graphs over the top of each other, using the alignment guides that pop up to align the axes. Position the copy of the secondary y-axis labels. Voilà\n\n\nA: Was able to do the same thing in Numbers 2009 (v2.1), but had to fiddle a lot.\nUse the 2-axis format. The program resists you all the way.\nHere is a 2-axis graph (climate diagram) created using Numbers 2.1:\n\n", "Q: Retrieve thumbnails from iPhoto? I have a friend who managed to lose some photos a while back, but they \"appear\" in his iPhoto library. The thumbnails are there but the photos aren't. The photos seem long gone, but the thumbnails seem fairly large- large enough to maybe be useful for some of them. Is it possible to retrieve the thumbnails?\n\nA: According to this website, the thumbnails are stored inside ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library, which you can access by right-clicking iPhoto Library and choosing to view the package contents.\nThe first location to check is inside of the Thumbnails folder, as mentioned by OP below.\nThe second place to look would be in Thumb64Segment.data, or ThumbJPGSegment.data. Therefore, I would back up these files and see if there are any applications which can read this file format. I haven't been able to find one after a brief search on the Internet, but I'll update this answer if I do.\nA third option might be that this may be happening because of a corrupt iPhoto Library. There's a tool called iPhoto Library Manager, which has a feature called First Aid that let's you:\n\nRebuild or extract photos from corrupted iPhoto libraries\n\nI haven't tried the software, so I don't know if it will work in your case, but they do have a trial version available.\n\nA: As a side note you can (~/Pictures/iPhoto Library; cmd-click iPhoto Library > Show Package Contents) check to see if they actually still exist. There should be a folder titled \"Originals\" and \"Modified\" in there.\nEach folder should have subs for years, etc.\nObviously Originals are the photos minus any edits while Modified would be the versions of edits (not certain if all versions of edits or only final edit).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you can still view them in iPhoto you should be able to export them. Just select the thumbnail and click file => export.\n", "Q: Does using a brightness reducing app save battery? I installed the app Brightness Slider on my MacBook because the lowest brightness setting in the System Prefs isn't low enough at times. When I choose a brightness setting below what the System Prefs allows, does the laptop in any way actually consume less power? Or is it using up the same amount of power?\n\nA: You would expect an app that dims the screen to save power. LEDs show a linear relationship for luminous intensity vs. forward current. The more you dim your LED display the less current it consumes.\n(I'm assuming you have a LED-backlit display as all current-model MacBook Pros and Thunderbolt Displays are, and I looking at a LED data sheet found at SparkFun for the intensity/current relationship. It should be the same for any LED-based product.)\nBUT if the app is not actually dimming - just covering everything with a transparent layer - then it may use more power. That app's reviews suggest it causes the discrete GPU to become active so I don't think there's any way it could be saving you power, more like the opposite. Adding a transparent layer over the entire display may decrease the apparent screen brightness but increase battery consumption due to the GPU having to do more work to blend the transparent dimming layer with other elements on the screen.\n", "Q: keyboard no longer repeats keys when held down I just wanted to make some input where I press a key and the auto-repeat function engages so I don't have to press the 0 key many times to make a long number.\n10000000000000000000000000000\nThis has always worked without fail in the past, but it's not something I do often and I'm not sure where to look next to figure out what might be preventing this. \n\nI've toggled the sliders to change the delay for key repeat, but the only thing I can hang my hat on is that perhaps Lion disables this with the new feature where you hold down some keys (like the vowels, but also some consonants) to get alternate accented characters.\ns turns into ß or ś or š and so on....\nAm I missing an obvious setting, or is this something that has moved to a hidden setting or is simply a bug that these controls are still around since key repeat is now deprecated?\nComments welcome if anyone doesn't have an answer, but can provide specifics where this does work for them. I've checked two Macs so I'm guessing it's not related to keyboard type or connection method.\n\nA: As Kyle menitoned, this is a side effect of Lion's new accent feature.\nIf you have TinkerTool installed, you could easily enable or disable the feature as of version 10.7, which lets you:\n\nRe-enable the key repeat feature\n\n\nA: The accented character selection when a key is held was one of the tiny things that changed in Lion. To disable it, run this in the Terminal:\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\nI will admit, though, it is strange that there's a setting in System Preferences that only affects behavior accessed through a defaults write command.\n", "Q: how to keep low-res photos handy, while archiving high-res versions? I have a laptop with a 256Gb SSD that always seems to be full.  A lot of my disk space is used by photos (in Aperture and iPhoto).\nWhat I really want is to have low-res versions of all my photos on the SSD with high-res versions backed up to an external hard drive or Time Capsule.  If I'm visiting family and someone spontaneously decides that they want to see Christmas from 4 years ago, I want to at least have low-res versions to show, even if I need to go home to my external hard drive for high-res versions.  And I want it to sync, such that if I decide while I'm on the road that some photo is crap and delete it, that it deletes the high-res version when I plug back into my external hard drive.\nThis seems so logical to me that I'm constantly surprised that this problem doesn't seem to be solved.  Aperture \"vaults\" appear to be just a backup copy of the entire library; they don't let you delete the high-res versions from your main computer.\nAm I missing something?  How do you keep photos from filling up the limited space on an SSD?\n\nA: Depending on how your Aperture library is set up, I think it will do this automatically. \nIf you use a referenced library (see the Aperture manual for more information on managed vs referenced), Aperture won't store the hi-res masters in its own library - it will leave the file management up to you. It does, however, keep a low-res preview of the image in the library. So you could store your images on an external HDD, but still have access to the low-resolution previews when the HDD isn't available.\nI haven't tried this myself, so I'm not sure how small the previews are, but I'm guessing they'd be good enough for the purpose you're describing.\n\nA: The automatic synching would be complex, but using Automator to create a service which copies the originals to the stated destination (external volume, mounted share, whatevs), then resizes the original down, wouldn't be too hard.  Then save that as a Finder service or as an application.  You could also add in some nice contact sheet action if you wanted..\n\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is the answer you are looking for. I work with Photoshop, and I'm not sure if Aperture has the same options, so stop me if I'm wrong but here is how I would do this.\nYou can create a automatic batch in Photoshop. Create 2 series of actions where you start with the original photos. The first action will store your original photos at your external hard-disk.\nThe second action will make a low-res copy of the images and store it in a folder at your choosing.  \nIn this way, you'll have all the work done for you and just need to select the folders where you would like to store both the low-res and the high-res photos. \nAgain, I don't know for sure if Aperture has something similar.\n", "Q: Is it possible to open in default browser a URL from command line reusing same tab? I know that I can use open command to open a URL in a default browser like:\n$ open http://google.com\n\nBut what I would like is to execute a similar or same command to open different URLs one after the other, but reusing the same tab of the browser.\nSomething similar to the HTML version of what I'm trying to achieve:\n<a href=\"http://google.com\" target=\"my_target_window\">Same tab</a>\n\n\nA: You can do this with some AppleScript. For Google Chrome it looks like:\non run argv\n  tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    set URL of active tab of window 1 to item 1 of argv\n    activate\n  end tell\nend run\n\nYou'd save that as a script file (.scpt) on disk and then call it with osascript from the command line. For example, if you saved that as ~/bin/chrome.scpt you'd do:\nosascript ~/bin/chrome.scpt https://apple.stackexchange.com/\n\nto open https://apple.stackexchange.com/ in the first Chrome window's currently active tab. If you wanted to make it a little simpler you could prefix the script with #! so it can be executed directly from your shell like so:\n#!/usr/bin/env osascript \non run argv\n  tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    set URL of active tab of window 1 to item 1 of argv\n    activate\n  end tell\nend run\n\nAnd then save that as ~/bin/chrome and chmod u+x ~/bin/chrome and call it like so:\n~/bin/chrome https://apple.stackexchange.com/\n\n", "Q: What's wrong with my launchctl config?

This overriding is created when you use the \"-w\" otherwise no override will be added to the overrides file.\nTo prevent this case, edit the file below, search the job label that you want to remove the override, delete the necessary lines:\n\npico /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist\n\nFor example, delete this line    \n<key>com.mydomain.myjob</key>\n<dict>\n        <key>Disabled</key>\n        <true/>\n</dict>\n\nthen you could use: launchctl load or unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mydomain.myjob.plist without the need of \"-w\" or \"-F\", you should not have the message nothing found to load\n\nA: You might want to add the -F flag to force launchctl to load the .plist. Also, make sure that the .plist is in the paths launchctl searches. If your .plist is somewhere else, you may also add the -D flag and specify the domain. From the manpage:  \n\n-D domain\n                         Look for plist(5) files ending in *.plist in the domain given. Valid domains include \"system,\" \"local,\" \"network\" and \"all.\" When providing a session type, an additional domain is available for use called \"user.\" For example, without a session type given, \"-D system\" would load from property list files from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons.  With a session type passed, it would load from /System/Library/LaunchAgents.  \n\nMake sure that you thoroughly review all information contained in the manpage - you can really wreck things if your call is not properly configured.\n", "Q: iPod 5th gen not showing in iTunes after error-check I have a mate's 5th generation iPod 30gb from 2005. It kept popping up saying \"check for errors\" on my Windows 7 so I finally ran the check. I then loaded it up in iTunes, but it froze and I shut it down. Now it's not showing up in iTunes at all! It shows up in Windows but not iTunes, any ideas? I've got all the most up to date software. Did all the error checks, service checks, emptied temp folder etc and still no luck.\n\nA: I found the following answer and it has worked!\n\nhttp://forums.ilounge.com/windows-ipod-discussion-problems/160623-ipod-not-being-detected-itunes-updater.html#post920916\n\nIn brief, the solution is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the iPod.\n\n*Uninstall iTunes and iPod Updater and reboot.\n\n*Hold down the Center and Menu buttons until the Apple logo appears on the screen (i.e., force a reboot).\n\n*Connect the iPod.\n\n*When the iPod appears in Disk Management (My Computer > Manage > Disk Management in Windows XP), format it as FAT32. Do not use Quick Format.\n\n*Install iPod Updater (not iTunes) and restore the iPod.\n\n*Reinstall iTunes and refresh iPod contents as desired.\n\n\nA: Have you tried to 'Restore' the iPod? iTunes will reset your iPod completely and restore you iPod software as he was new. You'll lose all your music and data, but there is a good chance you'll be able to use the iPod again.\nEDIT:\nSince you aren't able to see the iPod in iTunes, you can restore it using the iPod itself.  You can reset by holding down the MENU and Center buttons together for about 10-15 seconds, when the apple logo appears hit left + center...that takes you to the diagnostics menu. Play around in there, I think there's an option to do it.\n", "Q: CrashPlan's top-bar icon, how to get it? I have two Macs running CrashPlan. In one of them, one day, a CrashPlan icon appeared on the top menu bar that informs me when backups are being done, how much is backed up, etc. In the other one, I don't have that icon. Any ideas how to get it to appear?\n\nA: An alternative more direct way to access the Crashplan menu bar item is to directly launch it from within the Crashplan.app bundle.\nIt's located at /Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents/Helpers/CrashPlan menu bar.app\nI frequently exit the menu bar and re-open it to check Crashplan's status because it's much quicker than launching the full app.\n\nA: Are you sure you've checked the option to show it in your menu bar?\n\n\nA: I believe this icon was added in a recent update. It should update automatically, but in my machine something went wrong in the automatic update, and my Crashplan silently stopped running (I only discovered because I received that e-mail saying no backup was made in the last 3 days). Restarting my machine fixed the problem, applying the update correctly. After that it started showing the menubar icon.\nOne way for you to check if that's your case is to run the Crashplan app. If it freezes in the green logo with a \"Upgrading\" text, you should reboot your machine.\n", "Q: How to stop skype from automatically starting?

A few days ago I read an article how iOS app developers can uniquely identify my iOS device using its UDID. The thought of various apps being able to track me (with an ID attached) is somewhat unnerving. Also, I do not feel that I am getting a service of higher quality in exchange for letting developers learn about my preferences and habits. While Apple is apparently moving towards deprecating UDIDs, it will take time. Thus, my question: can I somehow restrict access to my device's UDID?\n\nA: In a word, no, it's currently available for any App to read, and then subsequently use as it sees fit.  However, Apple recently made clear that they would not approve future Apps that request it, and so it's use will be negated over time, but of course this won't necessarily apply to the millions of apps already approved.\n\nA: It's possible to spoof your UDID but only if your iDevice is jailbroken. You can freely try  PMP -  Protect My Privacy app from Cydia store which helps securing your UDID, Contacts and Location info by shuffling and generating random data access. \n\nA: Nowdays access to the UUID has been replaced by the Advertising Identifier that you could control if your want to share it with apps. Go to the Privacy section in settings and flip the switch to disable it.\n\nA: It says \"Limit Ad tracker\". You can chose it to be on or off. So in other words it will always be ON. That's how I understand it.\n", "Q: Migrating Linux/cyrrus IMAP into Lion server dovecot We changing our internal infrastructure and replacing old Linux server with an OS X Lion server.

Whenever I delete an app from the Applications folder, its shortcut stays in the Launchpad. In order to delete it, I have to click on it (a question mark appears), and then drag to the trash can. Is it a bug, or does this mean I am doing something wrong?\n\nA: It may be a bug, but I am thinking it may mean your Spotlight index is corrupt. \nI just tried deleting Evernote from my Applications folder. After authenticating, it moved it to the trash. I then checked launchpad again, and it was no longer there. Then, when I dragged it back out of the trash and placed back into Applications folder. Relaunched launchpad, and it was there again on the last page. As in, worked as expected here. \nLaunchpad keeps its own plist of what files there are, etc, and thats why there are some modification tools to allow to you to edit it. But I am assuming they would use spotlight to 'watch' your Applications folder to add new items not through the Mac App Store. I assume Spotlight because its a great tool for the job, installing Lion does a huge spotlight re-index, and they do use spotlight often behind the scenes. \nFirst, the GUI way I have seen online is to do this (I do the command line way below):\n\n\n*\n\n*In system's preferences -> spotlight -> Privacy add the drive you want to re-index\n\n*Quit System's preferences\n\n*Logout of your sessions\n\n*Login again :-)\n\n*In system's preferences -> spotlight -> Privacy remove the drive you want to re-index\n\n*Wait.. a faily long time. You should see mdworker and/or mds running\n\n\nPersonally, I have always done it through the command line. \n\n\n*\n\n*Launch ‘Terminal’ (located in /Applications/Utilities/) \n\n*At the command prompt, type this exactly: sudo mdutil -E / \n\n*You will be asked for your password, provide it, as this command requires\nadministrator privelages to run \n\n*You will receive a confirmation message saying that index will be rebuilt \n\n*Wait until index is finished rebuilding, this can take a while depending on the size of your hard drive, amount of files, etc.\n\n\nWhile I can't find any documentation online that 100% confirms that Launchpad uses Spotlight for this, this would be the first place I would look for the problem you are having. \n\nA: I think that it is expecting you to remove the application directly from LaunchPad.  Launchpad obviously reads it's apps list and folder groupings/layouts from some configuration file, and so when you remove an App it hasn't necessarily had a chance to remove that icon and it's associated positioning etc from it's config.\nIt would be interesting to see how often it checks for removed files etc, maybe it's a one-time boot or login process (perhaps you can test this by removing (or moving) an app and seeing if the icon remains after effectively restarting the LaunchPad process.\nThe best workaround, is to remove directly in LaunchPad.  This should remove the App from /Applications, and remove it fully from the LaunchPad configuration.\n", "Q: How can I keep \"Update Notifications\" from disrupting a Keynote presentation? When I was in the middle of teaching class, using Keynote, my presentation was disrupted when TextExpander discovered there was an update available and threw up a dialog box asking if I would like to download the update.  Obviously, this was the wrong time to ask me.  In the past, I've had a similar experience with Time Machine (\"It has been 10 days since your computer was last backed up with Time Machine\").\nI certainly can keep TextExpander from intruding by turning off the automatic checks for updates.  I could do the same with all other programs that have such update checks.  I'm not sure I can turn off the Time Machine request, other than by making sure to back it up frequently.\nHowever, the automatic updates are a really nice feature.  I like having my apps updated and I don't want to make a chore out of going out and discovering if I have updates available.  To a certain extent, the App Store update process may make the update maintenance easier, but I'm sure I'll always have apps that aren't MAS available.\nSo, is there a general way to ensure my Keynote presentation time is uninterrupted?  Perhaps something I can run during the presentation to block update requests?  Or a setting somewhere to keep Keynote from paying attention to any update requests?\n\nA: \nSo, is there a general way to ensure my Keynote presentation time is uninterrupted?\n\nUnless I know I'll absolutely need network access, I just turn off all network interfaces while I'm giving presentations. This effectively blocks any auto-update routines from running without having to disable and then re-enable the feature in any piece of software I might want to use during my talk.\nI'll also shut down all the programs I don't absolutely need running during a presentation. In particular email, instant message and any sort of communication apps that could cause a notification bell or a preview to pop up on my screen get shut down.\nI'll pause Growl (Growl icon in menu bar -> Pause Growl) so notifications don't interrupt my presentation.\nAnd I'll switch from any customized backgrounds I might have to some corporate logo backgrounds.\nI'll even clear my browser history. Not that there'd be anything lewd, but there might be competitor's websites or company-sensitive information that can be given away by URLs that auto-complete when I start to type in the browser.\nThat's my usual pre-flight check before I use my laptop in public presentation.\n\nA: For \"big\" presentations I run Keynote and give the preso from a separate demo account. I have a docked folder of shortcuts to things I might need—DropBox account, webmail access to my email, etc.—but the only login items for that account are Caffeine and Quicksilver.\nIf I'm giving a workflow demo I do sometimes use my main account, and generally follow Ian's suggestions for sanatizing it prior to the demo.\n\nA: I often run the presentation with extended screens, rather than mirror.  Not only does this show keynote notes on the main screen with handy timers and such, but it also generally means that notifications that do pop up go to the laptop screen, and not to the presentation screen.\nThis is in addition to closing all other software, and running software I need during the presentation just before so that I find out of there's an update available that will bother me when I first try to use the software.\n\nA: This is the best solution:\nTurning off notification center temporarily\nI had a music presentation that, while the screen interruptions wouldn't pop up, the sound would duck to accommodate the chime. Thankfully, the screen badges and notifications didn't invade, but the audience dipping in the middle of the music was distracting.\n", "Q: Change mac menu bar color Is there a way to change the color or appearance of the mac menu bar from the standard gray?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's no setting to change the color of the menu bar itself.\nLeoColorBar\nAs penguinrob suggests, you could set the menubar to translucent, and influence its color by changing the color of the part of the wallpaper underneath the menubar. LeoColorBar, pictured below, basically automates that for you.\n\nDespite the fact that it hasn't been updated in a while, it's worked perfectly for me in Lion.\nA black menu bar\nAlternatively, there are applications like Nocturne that you can use to set your menu bar to dark gray. \n\nMenuBarFilter is another application based on Nocturne that turns your menu bar black.\n\nThe latter two applications, however, didn't work very well for me in Lion (especially in full-screen mode), so your best bet would be to stick with LeoColorBar.\n\nA: In System Preferences, go to General. Check \"Use dark menu bar and Dock\". It will then change your menu bar and Dock to be a dark color.\n\nA: You can use the free LeoColorBar utility. It's very simple, and seems to work very well: just choose the preferred color, change its darkness, and you're all set. As a bonus, you can change your wallpaper within the app as well, and add arbitrary text to the menu.\n\n\nA: Penguinrob, \nIn order to change the color of the menu bar, follow the below mentioned steps properly:-\n1. Go to Apple menu> System preferences. Then click on Desktop and screen saver.\n\n\n*Now, click on the screen saver in the right side.\nPreview will be shown in the right side.\n\n*Set any of the screen saver settings below the screen saver to preview. If necessary, also click on the Screen Saver options.\n\n*Click the Start after pop-menu and then select an amount of time. The screen saver starts automatically one the Mac has been inactive for the period of time.\n\n*Select “Show with clock” to show the time when your screen saver is on.\n\n*Click Hot Corners to set a shortcut for starting your screen saver.\n\nA: This answer is for people who land here with new Silicon MacBook Pros with the Notch.\nTopnotch is a free option that works with dynamic wallpapers.\nDenotifier a paid option (with 14 day trial) offers some additional customization options such as independent settings for dark and light modes and can apply them dynamically if changed.\n\nA: In System Preferences -> Desktop & Screen Saver -> Desktop, you can check Translucent Menu Bar, which allows some of your wallpaper to show through.\nhttp://eece.github.com/MenuBarFilter/ allows you to have a black menu bar, although last time I tried it, there were issues with full-screen apps on Lion.\n\nA: Theres an app called MenuBar Filter. All you have to do is open the app and your menubar will become grey/black.\n", "Q: Better Skype taskbar icon? One thing I miss from Windows is that I always had a Skype icon at the bottom of my screen that would tell me when I had new messages.  Right now, the Skype icon in the Mac taskbar only lets me click on it to change my online status.  Is there an app out there for a better Skype icon or would there be a way to customize it to do what I want?  On Windows, it turns gold and there's a number with how many new messages you have.\n\nA: In the Skype Preferences, under the Notification tab, you can set the Skype icon to bounce, play a sound and display a built-in visual notification when you receive new messages. Click on the \"Event\" dropdown to select the events you require. Is this the sort of thing you were after?\n\n", "Q: How do I change the microphone input sensitivity on iPad 2? Is it possible to change the microphone sensitivity (input volume) on the iPad?\nIf so, how?\n\nA: What you can do with the built-in microphone is limited. You should investigate purchasing a third-party microphone, or better yet an audio interface with a microphone preamplifier, into which you plug a microphone. This will cost money but give you much more control.\nLook for products from Tascam, Apogee, Line 6, IK Multimedia, and Griffin.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to change the microphone sensitivity system wide on the iPad 2 and above, but only for external mics, as far as I know.\nTo adjust the audio input level you need two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's $5,- GarageBand (I don't know about free apps that can adjust the mic level)\n\n*An external microphone: either attached to the the mini jack (headphone connector, like Apple's own white earbuds) or attached to the Apple 30-pins or Lightning connector using the USB adapter of the camera connection kit or the Lightning-to-USB adapter cable.\n\n\nIn the voice recording section of GarageBand, select the button with the audio plug. With a supported device you should see the audio-input level slider and other extra settings like a monitor switch. The microphone input level adjusted in GarageBand, works system wide.\nDepending of the amount of current you USB-mic needs, it could be that the iPad cannot deliver sufficient energy to power the mic. In that case you can use the Griffin iMic, or a powered USB hub.\nMy Samson C01U works perfectly without any additional power requirements.\n", "Q: When applications are code-signed, what parts of the .app bundle does the signature cover? In Mountain Lion, I know that some applications, including all applications on the Mac App Store are digitally signed by the developer, so that if they are modified, the signature will not match, and it will raise all sorts of errors (and the situation will escalate with the next release of the operating system...).\nMy question is what parts of the .app bundle does the signature cover? If anything in Appname.app/Contents changes (including metadata, like the modified date for the Contents folder), does that break the signature? Is it just the binary in Contents/MacOS? Are the .plists included in the signature? The Resources? As an end user, what can I hack (if anything) without breaking the signature?\n\nA: Even though the question references Mountain Lion specifically, there is an important change in newer version of macOS. On macOS 10.11 and later, signatures that don't cover the entire code are rejected.\nSee Technical Note TN2206 - macOS Code Signing In Depth.\n\nA: TL;DR It's up to the developer to pick which pieces of the app are signed and whether or not tampering with those pieces results in any actions when the app is launched. You have to use trial and error to figure it out on an app-by-app basis.\nIt is largely up to the developer to decide which components in their application bundle are represented in the seal that gets signed before they deliver their application. Anything in the seal is effectively tamper-proof as it's mostly impossible to modify these things without changing their hash signatures. But that's doesn't actually mean you can't tamper with them.\nThe Apple Developer guide has this to say about what you should sign:\n\nYou should sign every executable in your product, including\n  applications, tools, hidden helper tools, utilities and so forth.\n  Signing an application bundle covers its resources, but not its\n  subcomponents such as tools and sub-bundles. Each of these must be\n  signed independently.\nIf your application consists of a big UI part with one or more little\n  helper tools that try to present a single face to the user, you can\n  make them indistinguishable to code signing by giving them all the\n  exact same code signing identifier. (You can do that by making sure\n  that they all have the same CFBundleIdentifier value in their\n  Info.plist, or by using the -i option in the codesign command, to\n  assign the same identifier.) In that case, all your program components\n  have access to the same keychain items and validate as the same\n  program. Do this only if the programs involved are truly meant to form\n  a single entity, with no distinctions made.\nA universal binary (bundle or tool) automatically has individual\n  signatures applied to each architecture component. These are\n  independent, and usually only the native architecture on the end\n  user's system is verified.\nIn the case of installer packages (.pkg and .mpkg bundles), everything\n  is implicitly signed: The CPIO archive containing the payload, the\n  CPIO archive containing install scripts, and the bill of materials\n  (BOM) each have a hash recorded in the XAR header, and that header in\n  turn is signed. Therefore, if you modify an install script (for\n  example) after the package has been signed, the signature will be\n  invalid.\nYou may also want to sign your plug-ins and libraries. Although this\n  is not currently required, it will be in the future, and there is no\n  disadvantage to having signatures on these components.\nDepending on the situation, codesign may add to your Mach-O executable\n  file, add extended attributes to it, or create new files in your\n  bundle's Contents directory. None of your other files is modified.\n\nAlso from here it's not necessarily true that having an invalid signature for an application means it will fail to launch. The page says:\n\nIt is up to the system or program that is launching or loading signed\n  code to decide  whether to verify the signature and, if it does, to\n  determine how to evaluate the results of that verification.\n\nAn application may choose to allow modifications.\nYour best bet is a trial-and-error approach with any application you're trying to modify. It may work, it may not. There's no always-true answer that can be given.\nIf an app has been signed you can look for a Contents/CodeResources file or a  Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources file in the bundle. This file lists all the signed components and their expected hash values in the bundle. It's a good place to start understanding what pieces of the application a developer deems critical enough to watch for changes.\n", "Q: Remote desktop thru firewall via vpn Scheme:\nMy_macbook -> INTERNET -> Linux_Proxy_Firewall-> Lion_On_The_Internal_Network\n\nSo, need set up encrypted tunnel between my macbook and Linux firewall and want connect into the internal Lion via Apple Remote Desktop.\nLooking for a simple, bulletproof - verified solution (so, from someone who really use it) for using ARD via VPN (road warrior config).\nProbably here is a way setup tunnels with plain ssh(1) or with SshTunnelManager, but never tried it yet - so any advice and/or real experiences is welcomed...\nAsking for real experience because here Apple wrote:\n\nWhen using VPN, you may need to set your router to allow a larger MTU\n  and/or to disallow fragmented packets.

What's a good method to copy lots of high resolution photos from my iPad using WiFi directly  to some sort of cloud server without having to use a Windows or Mac computer as an intermediary? Plus, once they're in the cloud, I'd like to delete the originals from the iPad and then use the iPad to organize/manage the photos on the cloud server: sort them into folders, rename them, and view them, etc. \nI think I can use Dropbox for much of this but is there anything more efficient for managing lots of high-res photos? I think iPhoto and Adobe Revel are only useful if your photo library is based on a desktop computer - I want to avoid that step.\n\nA: Isn't that exactly what the Photo Stream Feature is good for? It snycs all images directly into the iCloud. Yes it would also sync them to all devices, but I guess that's optional.\n\nA: www.picasaweb.com\nIt is a google service, so if you already have gmail then you already have an account.  I'm not sure if its native on apple devices, but there should be apps for ipad/iphone which do a lot of what you're asking.\n\nA: Are you sure Adobe Revel requires your library to be based on a desktop computer?\n\"Yes.

I'm running Adobe CS5.5 (photoshop v5.1) and iPhoto 2011. I just upgraded to Mountain lion from Snow Leopard and it works with both those operating systems.\n\nA: The reason is simple. iPhoto is the Manager of the photos, Photoshop is the editor. \nSo you browse the photos in the Manager and then, should you wish to edit them, you send them from the Manager to the editor. This means you set Photoshop as an external editor in iPhoto. \nYou can set Photoshop (or any image editor) as an external editor in iPhoto. (Preferences -> General -> Edit Photo: Choose from the Drop Down Menu.) This way, when you double click a pic to edit in iPhoto it will open automatically in Photoshop or your Image Editor, and when you save it it's sent back to iPhoto automatically. This is the only way that edits made in another application will be displayed in iPhoto. \nIf you want to manage the photos with Bridge, then don't use iPhoto, and vice versa.\n\nA: found this fix to work:\nhttp://masonsklut.com/blog/use-your-iphoto-library-in-adobe-bridge/\ncheers :)\n", "Q: Xcode appears to be installed but xcodebuild is unusable I was had to reinstall Xcode 4 and now I'm getting message Xcode appears to be installed but xcodebuild is unusable; and xcodebuild exists but failed to execute all the time when I try to install anything using ports:\n\nash-3.2$ sudo port install wget\nPassword:\nWarning: xcodebuild exists but failed to execute\nWarning: configured user/group adm does not exist, will build as root\nWarning: Xcode appears to be installed but xcodebuild is unusable; some ports will likely fail to build.\nWarning: You may need to run `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app`\n--->  Computing dependencies for wget\n\nxcodebuild exists but it wants to another one xcodebuild or it just wants to be in /Developer folder?\n\n$ which xcodebuild\n/usr/bin/xcodebuild\n\n$ /usr/bin/xcodebuild \nerror: can't exec '/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild' (No such file or directory)\n\nWhat's wrong with this utility?

It is well documented that you cannot stream to more than one AirPlay compatible device through iOS. (In an early developer build of 4.0 the functionality was put in but was taken out in the GM). \nI am aware you can stream iTunes content to multiple devices and even use the Apple Remote App to control multiple devices.\nHowever, I am looking for a solution that allows me to play a Pandora/Spotify/Slacker/Songza app on my iOS device and allow me to stream that music to multiple devices.\nThe only solution I have found right now is a complex solution using Rogue Ameoba's AirPlay Speakers app on the iMac but there is about a 4 second lag and additionally, once you have captured audio, you have to manually go to the computer to cancel the connection to allow for other connections.\nDoes anyone have other workarounds or solutions to this challenge?\n\nA: So far I haven't found a good all-digital solution.  I typically use an audio splitter at the computer, and a whole house FM transmitter plus speakers so I hear the sound locally and through FM radios I place wherever I want the sound.\nSince everything is transmitted real time, there's no sync delay as you move from room to room, and the transmitter I have is strong enough to receive using a boombox out in the yard while I'm working outside, without risking any expensive equipment in case it gets kicked around the yard or rained on a little bit.\nI use a modified Belkin Tunecast transmitter.  I disassembled it, and added a length of wire to the antenna connection to stretch the distance it transmits a little.  There are some legal ramifications to this depending on the country you live in.  If you want a more professional solution, there are a few places that sell whole-house FM transmitters fairly inexpensively.\nYou could also connect the transmitter to the airplay receiver, entertainment center, iPad, Android phone, windows PCs, or any other audio device, and the receivers are cheap - you can get an FM radio from the dollar store for a dollar, and amplified speakers for a dollar, so expanding the system is cheap.  It's very flexible.\nThe biggest drawback is quality.  It's not bad, but you can't expect even CD quality from it, nevermind high quality audio.  It's ok for music and voice, but audiophiles will be offended.  Airplay is CD quality, and the difference would be noticeable.\n\nA: There is a NodeJS project on GitHub that does it https://github.com/nguyer/shaircast\nEdit:\nDescription from the project …\n\nThis is a major first world problem. shaircast solves this problem.\n  shaircast is a super simple Node.js application that combines\n  nodetunes and node-airtunes to take a single AirPlay stream (from your\n  iPhone or iPad) and broadcast it to multiple AirPlay speakers.

In a standard corporate environment with PCs they are replaced approximately every 36 months on a revolving schedule.\nIn introducing Macs into the corporation, the IT department appears to be unable or unwilling to make a schedule for standard replacement, and thus the Mac users are getting upgraded ram and such, but their machines are older than the PCs.\nWhat information should we be taking to the IT department to convince them to create such a schedule?  Should we expect the schedule to be longer than typical PC replacement schedules, or the same?  What aspects of a Mac make this a different equation than a PC?\n\nA: In a typical corporate scenario you have to balance cost, resale value, and depreciation. This is all the accounting department really cares about, and that's who the IT department reports to.\nIn general terms:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macs are more expensive than the equivalent PCs. In other words if you need to do X, Y, and Z and it can be done on either platform, the cost of the minimum machine that will do it is less for PC than Mac.\n\n*Macs have a high resale value. After 2 years a PC will have dropped to a very low cost, but a similar Mac will still hold significant value.\n\n*Macs depreciate slowly, while accounting typically uses one depreciation value for all computer equipment.\n\n\nThe combination of high resale value, but the same depreciation may tip the scales in your favor - or at least temper the initial cost of the machine. The machine may be partially or fully depreciated when it's sold, but it will sell for a higher cost than the PCs they would sell at the same time.\nIn most scenarios anything shorter than a 2 year replacement plan is going to cost the company more money than the value they'll get out of the machine, but anything longer than a 3 year plan will cost the company in terms of performance (employee waiting for the machine to catch up) than they'll lose buying a new machine and selling the old one. \n\nA: It's probably a matter of debate how 'end of life' is defined; as one comment says, one reasonable definition is that it's at end of life when it no longer does what you want it to.\nThat said, another reasonable definition would seem to be whether the hardware in unsupported by the latest version of Mac OS. Here's the list of Macs which are supported by OS X. So if your MacBook Pro isn't on that list, you might be able to use that as justification to argue that it needs replacing!\n\nA: Generally speaking, Apple supplies security fixes only for the current major OS X release (10.x) and the preceding one. So if security is of utmost importance to you, then a good rule of thumb is to replace the machine when the most recent version of OS X it can run is two major versions behind. \nToday, that would be a machine that maxed out at 10.6, since 10.8 is the current version.\nHowever, starting with 10.7, Apple has started to release major new versions every year, so they may begin extending security updates further back, otherwise you'd be out of luck after only two years. But there have only been two releases since then (10.7 and 10.8), so it hasn't been long enough yet to determine what they'll do when they get to 10.9 next year and 11.0 (or 10.10?) the year after.\n\nA: This is purely a business process and budgeting issue since CPU don't slow down and you need to have backup computers for business-critical machines whether they are one day old or one decade old (less you suffer the consequences of failure or mistake by an operator).\nWhen the cost of maintaining an asset exceeds the cost to hire new tools to do their job, you make a business decision to get new tools.\nWhether or not a Mac has gone vintage in Apple's eyes yet or not (typically this happens 5 years after a product is withdrawn from sale) you can still arrange for service and support from Apple or other parties so a business has far more flexibility than most consumers with respect to keeping old tech running.\nIt also seems like you are looking at the problem from the wrong perspective. Unless you have the accounting team's scoop on whether you want to carry a capital expense or leased expense, the buy/lease/rent calculation has more effect on buying than what you guess a suitable lifespan of the tool will be. The amortization taken and the situation of the tax burden of the entity will color any capital expense decision far more than whether you are planning on a 18 month renewal cycle or a 180 month renewal cycle. Take a look at how many Windows XP machines still exist in the workplace and you'll see that there is no hard and fast rule on when to expire technology, Mac or otherwise.\n\nA: short answer:\nApple uses terms like vintage (5+ years) and obsolete (7+ years) versus end of life.\nThey have nice list here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 \nfrom apple site:\nVintage and obsolete products\nOwners of iPad, iPhone, iPod or Mac products may obtain service and parts from Apple or Apple service providers for 5 years after the product is no longer manufactured (or longer where required by law). Apple has discontinued support for certain technologically obsolete and vintage products.\nVintage products are those that have not been manufactured for more than five and less than seven years ago. \nlong:\nFor me its\ncan I install the latest OS or not?\ncan you still get parts OEM? Can I add enough ram or an ssd? do they have the ports they need?\ncan people do what they need to do with out affecting real measured output productivity? Often people say oh yeah it's faster, but if you get more work done, it's not always an easy answer.\nhow often do users reboot, once a day, week or longer?\nif only once a week or longer... is the new mac \"significantly\" faster after it's booted and apps are open and cached? \nother costs are how much IT time does it take to support MAC vs PC users and systems?\nwhen looking at MAC vs PC outside of cost/performance , another factor most ignore is apple scripting. It's like having excel VBA, but across any program.\nGoogle will make people write a business case if they want a PC, I don't know why, I know google has their own custom IT apple tools that we don't but there have to be more complex reasons why a more expensive computer has an overall lower operational cost for them.\n", "Q: Process List App Is there a GUI app on Mac similar to Task Manager on Windows?  My MBP is running slow this morning and I would like to see what it's doing.  I know I can open a terminal and run 'ps' and 'top', but what can I use from the desktop?\n\nA: Activity Monitor is the graphical application that comes with every OS X install for viewing and managing processes from your desktop.\nYou'll find it under Applications -> Utilities in a default OS X install.\n\nIn order to manage all the processes displayed in Activity Monitor you'll need an account with administrator privileges on the machine. With a lower privilege account you can only only manipulate your own processes or processes from groups to which you belong.\nHere's a quick summary of the kinds of thinks you can accomplish with Activity Monitory. And a guide for finding out what's keeping your machine busy.\nIn particular, if you suspect you're running slow because of applications using excessive CPU, you'll want to click on the 'CPU' column header to sort applications by their CPU use. If you spot a few applications running hot you can use the search box to limit the Activity Monitor view to just a few applications.\nThe spinbox to the left of the search box contains some different view filters that can be handy. In particular I find the 'All Processes, Hierarchically' view to be valuable when it comes to tracing down parent processes of rogue child processes so you can see where things are coming from. It's a bit like pstree but interactive and continually updating.\n\nA: Try Activity Monitor in your Utilities folder.\n", "Q: PL/SQL Mac compiler or Mac OS X compatible softwares How can I run PL/SQL in Mac OS X Lion.

I use a KVM switch on my Mac Pro and Cinema Display. While the display is on another computer, the Mac switches to a different resolution (not seeing a monitor). I know it does while switching back to the Mac as my screen windows have changed places, to the lower half of my screen while the resolution is back to normal.\nDoes anybody know how to prevent this from happening. I've searched for \"fixed screen resolution\" etc. I've tried SwitchXres and Stay to no avail. (These apps do not work if there is no screen.)\nIt would be great if I could set the screen resolution to only one setting (the max) and that there are no other alternatives where the Mac could choose from.\n\nA: This is in all probability down to the KVM providing a fake monitor signal to OS X whilst the monitor is not \"connected\" to the OS X box; providing the KVM model would confirm this.\nGenerally, KVM fall into three monitor modes, usually these are priced low to high:\n\n\n*\n\n*No signal - where the non active connections receive no indication that a monitor is connected\n\n*Fake - where the KVM provides a signal to the host that indicates a monitor is connected\n\n*Pass through - where the KVM emulates or attempts to provide through another fashion, the signal of the monitor to all hosts\n\n\nEDIT: I did test adding a monitor to a Mac Mini and the resolution it first went in on was low, even after setting up the resolution, disconnecting the monitor (power off at the wall and back on) only sometimes caused the resolution to default back to a very basic one.\n\nA: It's been a while,\nI got rid of the KVM switch, I now remote control the other computer and don't have the problem anymore. The KVM switch has hit the road!\nThanks for helping to confirm this problem. I do not see any solution to this problem.\nFrank\n", "Q: How can I use Lion's \"look up\" feature without the trackpad?

Currently, there's no way to unselect that choice via the default UI. \nHowever, a few posters in an Apple Discussion forum have provided some Terminal commands and created AppleScript scripts that can perform this task. \nTerminal Solution\nScott Nash wrote:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open up your ~/Library/Preferencese/ByHost folder and delete\n  the com.apple.loginwindow.<long alpha-numeric string> \n  \n*Copy and\n  paste this command into Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow TALLogoutSavesState 0\nThe file you deleted is the one that stores\n  which apps and windows are open.

It should be 0, now.   \nThe\n  checkbox in the shutdown dialog will remain checked, but you won't\n  need to change it. It should ignore that since the main preference is\n  set to not save state.\n\nScript Solution\nVic07 wrote:\n\nBy using a simple AppleScript application, you can achieve this in a\n  consistent way.   \nI've compiled an application that after clicking its\n  icon, it will shut down your Mac with \"save state\" disabled.

I tried rebinding my keyboard with Ukelele to switch the return key with the ' key. This works fine most of the time.

What sequence of steps is needed to get my new name displayed on devices that had friended me before I changed my display name?\n\nA: Have you tried contacting your credit card provider?\nSeriously, Apple's intention is that iOS Game Center friends are meant for \"real\" friends—rather than \"Facebook friends\"—so exposing your real name is not a threat. If you look at the issue this way, it feels more of a security enhancement than a threat. You can be sure the friend you are friending is actually the person you believe them to be.\nMoreover, if you are underaged and can't attach your own credit card with your Apple ID, it is, in contrast, more secure to have the user's (kiddie's) name obfuscated. \nFinally some legalese from the Game Center TOS:\n\nThe full name associated with your Apple ID will also be shared with those users to whom you send, or from whom you accept, a friend request, such as in the Friends list, the Friends leaderboards, and the pending friends requests lists; and we may recommend games that you have played to your friends. If you prefer not to share your full name or profile with friends, you should remove that friend by tapping the “Unfriend” button at the bottom of that friend’s screen in Game Center.\n\nFor each friend's account you need to force an update, you should unfriend them and then establish the friend relationship again. \n", "Q: Can't see drafts folder in Mac Mail I have a recent MacBook Pro that was running OS X 10.6 but was recently updated to 10.7. My work email switched from Gmail to Exchange and they said to use the built-in Mail app. Overall, I like it, but I can't figure out how to see my drafts folder. According to the help, it only shows up if I have something in it, but I tried composing a message and saving it, and I still don't see my drafts folder in my list of folders. What am I supposed to do about this?\n\nA: I fixed this issue by restarting Mail. I have no idea why the drafts folder wasn't showing up before.\n\nA: This is a setting in Mail preferences. Go to Preferences > Accounts > (account) > Mailbox Behaviors and enable Drafts.\n\nIf that doesn't work, show the Favorites Bar (View > Show Favorites Bar) and Drafts should be an option. Click it.\n\n\nA: I just tried it with an Exchange account in Mail app with Mac OS 10.7.3.\nI got this when I save the message :\n\nThen I find it in the Draft folder (which were not here before) :\n\nDid you try to quit Mail after you saved your message then reopen again ?\nCheck that you have this option enabled in your account preferences too : \n\nOtherwise it could be an Exchange issue.\nHope this helps !\n\nA: Same deal - I had the same issue then resolved by creating a new message, closing the message out, then saving it as a Draft. Magically my draft folder appeared. Problem solved. Not a great user experience though!\n\nA: Right Click -> Get Account Info->Drafts-Show Messages \nYou will be able to see drafts folder thereafter .\nCheers!!!\nAnkur \n", "Q: Do downloads continue when lid is closed? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there any way to set a MacBook Pro to not sleep when you close the lid? \n\nIf I close the lid on my Macbook Air (OS X 10.5.8), will it continue downloading files - say from Firefox or Dropbox?  Is there any way to make it do this?\n\nA: Nope. When you close the lid, your Mac goes to sleep and stops all current downloads. If you have a downloadmanager, it will pause the downloads, but it will not keep downloading the files.\nIf you would like to work with your lid closed, I suggest you connect an external screen or try software like InsomniX, which will keep your Mac awake when the lid is closed.\nAlso, it might be worth trying extention No Sleep.\n\nA: If you close the lid with an external display connected, the system should not go to sleep automatically.  In that case your downloads would continue.  Otherwise, the default behavior when you close the lid is to put the system to sleep.  Downloads cannot continue if the system is in sleep mode.\n", "Q: How to search for a file by a hash value with bash script (terminal)? I am writing a script for Mac OS X Lion 10.7 and I would like to know how I can search for files based on their SHA1 hashes. I would like to search the whole file system for the file(s) I will be looking for.\nFor example the SHA1 value 0d882ff2d5edd7d045c1b57320d2e046793868f8 corresponds to the file MacOSXUpdCombo10.7.2.dmg How can I search the hard drive for the file with its SHA1 value without needing to compare the file?\n\nA: You can use the find command:\nfind / -type f -exec sha1sum {} \\; | grep 0d882ff2d5edd7d045c1b57320d2e046793868f8\n\nHowever, since you're running this on all files, it may be extremely slow — try limiting the search directory by replacing / with the path to a specific directory you want to search.\n\nA: You may also want to try using xargs depending on how many files you will be searching through.\nfind / -type f |\n    xargs -I {} openssl sha1 {} | \n    grep 0d882ff2d5edd7d045c1b57320d2e046793868f8\n\n\nA: Here are a few lines of command which may help find a file from its SHA1 digest.

On my MacBook, with 10.7.3, if I go to ~/Pictures/iPhotoLibrary, no images show in the Finder, though it does say \"size 4.01GB\". If I double click on iPhotoLibrary, iPhoto opens up — is this the only way to view images and drag files, etc? Can't I view them in Finder?\n\nA: The iPhoto (and Aperture) library is now a package — it's still a folder on disk, but in order to view its contents, you must explicitly choose File > Show Package Contents in Finder (or you can right-click on it).\n\n\nA: I found another way recently where by you can simply locate the file in finder itself. I have attached some step-by step photos of how to locate them but it essentially goes like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Go to 'Pictures'\n\n*Right-click 'iPhoto Library'\n\n*Select 'Show Package Contents'\n\n*You will be presented with several folders \n\n*Select 'Masters'\n\n*Within this are folders of every year photos have been taken in\nFrom here you can go to every event and date, however, in a rather unfortunately awkward way \n\n\nHopefully that helps if you are looking for another way, and more direct way, to locate files directly within finder, especially in you fancy renaming the once that you want or need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I found this answer helpful https://superuser.com/questions/186385/how-to-open-iphoto-library-folder-on-a-mac. Specifically \"When you have an \"open file\" dialog (to choose files to upload, etc.) on the left there is also a media section which makes it convenient to access iPhoto photos. Pretty easy actually, no need to navigate through a package.\"\n", "Q: Backing up images that are in iPhoto Library In my backup software, iPhotoLibrary is greyed out, so I can't select it to back it up.\nHow do I select the iPhotoLibrary to back it up?\n(My back up program is Workspace Desktop (a Godaddy program).\n\nA: You can do so even without your back-up program.\nInside the Pictures folder you'll see a file called iPhoto Library. Copy this file to a location you find suitable for your backup and vwoila, there is your back-up!\nAnd just for the record, why don't you use TimeMachine?\n\nA: Most Simple Back Up\nDrag the iPhoto Library from your Pictures Folder to another Disk. This will make a copy on that disk.\nSlightly more complex: \nUse an app that will do incremental back ups. This is a very good way to work. The first time you run the back up the app will make a complete copy of the Library. Thereafter it will update the back up with the changes you have made. That makes subsequent back ups much faster. Many of these apps also have scheduling capabilities: So set it up and it will do the back up automatically. Examples of such apps: Chronosync or DejaVu . But are many others.

(but not pause iTunes because it's getting close to peak times when my connection is throttled, so it's best to use as much data as possible beforehand)\nIs there a built in feature of OSX or iTunes that lets you allocate bandwidth to apps?\nOr is there a 3rd party app that allows you to do this?\n\nA: This utility allows you to throttle speeds on certain domains -  http://osxdaily.com/2009/08/19/limit-connection-bandwidth-with-speedlimit/\nYou could then throttle the domains that iTunes uses - a1.phobos.apple.com to a1999.phobos.apple.com\n", "Q: iTunes match is on but I can't copy songs from my PC to my iphone without redownloading them on my iphone from the cloud iTunes match is on but I can't copy songs already downloaded to my PC to my iphone without redownloading them on my iphone from the cloud.\nIs this by design or am I missing something. Seems like an odd thing.\n\nA: It's by design. iTunes Match will upload (or match) your songs with your iCloud. They will show up on any other device (up to 10 devices) where you've enabled iTunes Match. But in order to play the song on your other device, it needs to be downloaded (or at least streamed).\nWhich is kind of obvious, since you can't play a song out of nowhere. So your iPhone will stream (or download, depending on what you choose) the song and than play it. It will even start playing before it finished downloading the song.\nYou can find more information about iTunes Match and the working process behind on this website.\n\nA: This is even more frustrating if you songs are more than 256k because when match gives them to your other devices, they are 256k\n", "Q: Does Apple provide disk space that I can back my hard drive up to? As I understand, with Time Machine I need to provide a drive to back data on to.\nIs there also an option to use a server managed by Apple to back up on to?\nEither using Time Machine or another program.\n\nA: The Apple Time Capsule is a network router and network storage server with a 2TB or 3TB hard drive.\nWhen you said, \"server\" do you mean something you can own and run in your home, or something that exists at a remote location, managed by a storage company, that you access over the Internet?\nInternet storage is not suitable for backing up your entire Mac, because moving that many files of that size through your Internet connection is far too slow and inefficient.\nYou need a local physical hard drive in your home or business to regularly back up your entire Mac using Time Machine. You can supplement this with an Internet storage service like Mozy or Carbonite, but that should only be used for a critical subset of your documents and data, because of the time required to back up the data, and the high cost.\n\nA: At this point, iCloud only supports backups of iOS devices (though it will keep documents, in those applications which support iCloud document storage). However, other solutions such as Backblaze and Mozy are available (though not free).\n\nA: A lot of third party NAS solutions provide support for Time Machine such as the Buffalo Linkstation, the Drobo, et al\n\nA: This is all conjecture:\nYou may choose to create a virtual device or partition on a remote server and mount it on your Mac either using sshfs or MacFuse. Essentially, as long as Time Machine was able to read/write to the partition, it could perform the necessary functions in order to start your backups.\n", "Q: Chrome toolbar icons acting weirdly It recently started happening that the icons in Google Chrome started freaking out, and randomly look weird:\n\nAnd they don't always look the same, either:\n\nThe appearance of them tends to change if I hover over them, do any tab-related actions, disconnect or connect my external monitor, etc.\nThe download circle progress bar and icon also exhibit this behavior.\n\n\nA: I assume you are using the dev version of Chrome (19.0.1077.3). If so, this is a bug that was introduced a few days ago. Expect it to be fixed with the new update. Here's the bug report on the official Google blog: Dev Channel Update.\nEdit: I just checked for updates manually, and indeed the update was available, solving the rendering issue.

I'm trying to find out if I can get iTunes to do something complex, but don't know what can be scripted.\nIs there a way to find out what applescript commands an app will respond to?\n\nA: Alternately, you can drag an application icon to the Script Editor icon to display its dictionary (if it has one). — via Apple’s AppleScript Language Guide\n\nA: Yes, there is a simple way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Script Editor app (formerly called AppleScript Editor)\n\n*Go to File -> Open Dictionary\n\n*Select the app you want to find out more about.\n\n\n\nWhen you open it, you can browse through the available AppleScript commands for that application and find what you want.\n\n", "Q: How to partially uncover bullet points in Keynote In Keynote '09 on the Mac, how can I create a list of bullet points such that:\n\n\n*\n\n*At first, the bullets are all dimmed or grey\n\n*When I click, the next bullet becomes undimmed or black\n\n\nThis is similar to the 'appear' effect, which uncovers bullet points one by one. The difference is that I want the uncovered bullets to be partially visible instead of completely hidden.\n\nA: I figured out a way to do this. It isn't perfect. It's limited to being useful against solid colour backgrounds. If you're using a gradient background or a complex image this won't work.\nAdd a mask in the form of a rectangle over top of each bullet point. You don't need to be super precise. Just get the rectangle to cover all of the bullet point text. Do one rectangle for each bullet you want to reveal. I used an obvious colour in the screen show below so you could see what I mean.\n\nOpen the Inspector window and select actions. For each rectangle set the action to dissolve and set the triggers to be however you'd like (on each key press, one after the other, etc.).\n\nNow change the rectangle fill colour to match your background and set the opacity level of each rectangle to be something dim. 80% or so should do it.\nNow when you play the slide, each click will cause a rectangle to disappear revealing the text below it at its full brightness.\nHere's a Keynote presentation that illustrates the concept for you to play with. And here it is in action:\n\n\nA: In Keynote 6.2 this works:\n\nThere is a built-in fade build for bullet points in Keynote. To use\n  it, create your bullets, select the text box they are in, and go to\n  the Build Inspector. There, select an Effect, then go to the Delivery\n  drop-down menu. One option is By Highlighted Bullet. This option will\n  fade the prior bullet point as a new one comes in. \nUnfortunately, you don't have a lot of control over the fade (you can\n  make it a different colour, for example). If you need some more\n  specific effect, you will have to create it \"by hand\" using separate\n  text boxes for each bullet point, with the appropriate build-in and\n  build-out applied to each.\n\nFrom https://discussions.apple.com/thread/704542?tstart=0\n\nA: Another solution that does not require using masks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the bullet list\n\n*Before applying the transitions, duplicate the text box containing your list. [Select the text box and then ⌘+D]\n\n*Change the opacity of the duplicate text box to the desired percentage.\n\n*Align both boxes with the 'faded' box behind the one you wish to animate.\n\n*Set the Build In Animation by bullet as desired in the Animation inspector.\n\n\nSo, regardless of your background, this simple solution should have the desired affect.\nThis should work in any version of Keynote.\n\n\n", "Q: What is the Mac equivalent of Windows' Power Plans' Maximum Processor State? One of my favorite features in Windows is the built-in Power Plans. I can change how much energy my computer uses - whether I want it to drain power like there's no tomorrow and get incredible performance or whether I want it to run like a turtle and use 1% CPU at the max and barely use any power, or anything in between. \nMy favorite feature of Power Plans is that I can limit CPU usage. I can make it 30% - or 72% - or 94 percent.\nOn a Mac, I notice that there are no Power Plans. There is this, but that doesn't do it.\nWhat can I use to limit CPU usage by the entire system (not just one process) on a Mac?\n\nA: OS X has SpeedStep built in, but as you have noticed you have no/little control over it.\nCoolbook is a program that works on pre-Lion versions of OS X but is still not working correctly under Lion?  It is also limited to Core Duo and Core 2 Duo processors.\n\nA: Processor usage is processor usage is processor usage. Limiting your CPU to, say, 20% would mean that the same task you want to do anyway would still occur, but take up to 5x longer. The battery life of your machine would actually decrease because it would need to power the display, HDD, etc. for longer to do the same task.\n\nA: I think that Windows limit it not only by software, but OS X does NOT do that.\nThey both implements SpeedStep, but OS X offers no fine-grained control, while Windows do.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there are no power plans built in macOS, however, they may be available from other third parties.  Most won't work with 10.7 or above though.  \n", "Q: Retina enabled Apps and file sizes With the new iPad being released with the Retina display, many apps are being updated with new graphics and images to enable native resolution images to be displayed.\nHowever, with increasing resolutions comes the resultant increase in image file sizes.  Your definition of what constitutes double resolution or not may vary, but when it comes to pixel count and associated image size we are looking basically at an approximate 4x increase for any bitmap style image resource.\nTake the following snippet of information as a basis for my question:\nApp (Pre-Retina) Post Retina\n\n\n*\n\n*Pages    (95Mb) 269Mb\n\n*Numbers  (109Mb) 283Mb\n\n*iMovie   (70Mb) 404Mb\n\n\nI would like to know if there is a resource anywhere on the internet that tracks App versions so that I can check which apps have been updated to Retina graphics (and/or are likely to be in the future based on either previous update history or developer statements), and includes such metadata as download size, so that I can work out whether my previous rule of thumb (\"unless you store music photos or video on your iPad, 16Gb is all you need for apps\") still holds true, or if 32Gb should now be considered the minimum for all but very light usage.\nI currently have 2Gb free on a 16Gb Gen 1 iPad running a mix of apps and games, but with minimal data storage requirements (no media, basically), so it's likely I would not be able to upgrade to an 16Gb iPad Gen 3 on the assumption that all the apps got the Retina treatment.\nAny other information on the sorts of Apps that are more affected by the size increase would be useful.  Games seems an obvious problem area, but then if it's an OpenGL game running 3D Rendering, will the hit be quite the same as a 2D platformer running bitmapped graphics?\n\nA: I thought the AppStore provided information regarding if the APP was retina ready ? I think most of the apps in the market today are coming out with standard of Retina Ready .\nAnd for the previous answer to the question - AppTrackr is now shutdown :)\n\nA: wwww.apptrackr.org isn't bad for checking app versions and their sizes. Although it obviously doesn't have all the apps with their versions (it has just the pirated ones!!), I think it can be helpful in your case.\n", "Q: How do I decrease excessive network buffering over Wireless-N I've got a mid-2009 Macbook Pro running Lion over 802.11n with an Airport Extreme and cable internet. I've been seeing drop-outs while using video chat (be it Facetime, Skype, Google Chat) and doing anything else (gaming, Hulu, Netflix, etc) on the network.\nI ran ICSI's Netalyzr and found that the network buffering was 4000ms upstream and 3200ms downstream, which is abysmal. Running the same test on my Windows 7 machine (over 802.11b) results in 220ms upstream and 1800ms downstream.\nAggravatingly enough, when I switch my Macbook to 802.11b, Netalyzr fails to complete. I initially chalked this up to a bad test, however, video still drops out and a ping somedomain.com in the background will show progressively increasing RTT's and packetloss.\nNo such deficiencies exist on my Win7 desktop.\nI was unable to find any option under network preferences, and searches only brought up complaints about buffer-bloat without specifics. How do I \"improve\" the buffering behavior under Lion?\n\nA: I don't have any specific recommendations when tweaking network configurations. However, I did come across one blog post that discussed various network settings that could be adjusted in /etc/sysctl.conf:\n\nkern.ipc.maxsockbuf=4194304\nkern.ipc.somaxconn=512\nkern.ipc.maxsockets=2048\nkern.ipc.nmbclusters=2048\nnet.inet.tcp.rfc1323=1\nnet.inet.tcp.win_scale_factor=3\nnet.inet.tcp.sockthreshold=16\nnet.inet.tcp.sendspace=262144\nnet.inet.tcp.recvspace=262144\nnet.inet.tcp.mssdflt=1440\nnet.inet.tcp.msl=15000\nnet.inet.tcp.always_keepalive=0\nnet.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=0\nnet.inet.tcp.slowstart_flightsize=4\nnet.inet.tcp.blackhole=2\nnet.inet.udp.blackhole=1\nnet.inet.icmp.icmplim=50\n\n\nYou'll definitely want to back up the original file before fiddling with these system settings. Various readers also contributed to a lengthy discussion in the comments for the blog post.\nApple Support also has a KB for OS X 10.7 detailing changes that can be made to the MTU for Ethernet, which might also be adjusted for performance issues. However, there were no specific instructions for Wi-Fi.\nThere's an associated Support KB for older versions of OS X (10.4 and 10.5) that details changes for both Wi-Fi and Ethernet - you may be able to apply use the Wi-Fi instructions in Lion.\nIf you take the first path (adjusting the sysctl.conf settings), some trial and error may be necessary.\n\nA: Restarting the router and cable modem had no effect, however, telling the Airport Extreme to use a separate SSID for N-connections has made a huge difference.\nAt the moment I cannot tell if this is due to other variables (such as local loop usage, etc), but it appears to have \"solved\" the problem. The upstream buffering is now ~200ms and the downstream buffering is ~100ms.\n\nA: Have you tried changing your wireless channels?  Yesterday, I noticed that my VNC connection to another host on my LAN was horrible and when I ping'ed the IP address of my AirPort extreme, it was around 60ms just to get there.  I changed it from channel 11 to channel 3 (2.4GHz, wide channels enabled), and my ping times dropped down to 2-3ms.  I assume this is due to decreased interference with neighboring APs.\n", "Q: Problem trying to install iftop via Homebrew I got Homebrew installed, but:\n>brew install iftop\n==> Downloading http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop/download/iftop-0.17.tar.gz\nFile already downloaded in /Volumes/0/z/Library/Caches/Homebrew\n==> ./configure --disable-debug --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/iftop/0.17 --mandir=/usr/local/Cellar/iftop/0.17/share/man\n==> make install\nln: iftop: Permission denied\nError: The linking step did not complete successfully\nThe formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local\nYou can try again using `brew link iftop'\nWarning: /usr/local/sbin is not in your PATH\nYou can amend this by altering your ~/.bashrc file\n==> Summary\n/usr/local/Cellar/iftop/0.17: 7 files, 116K, built in 3 seconds\n\nFYI, ~/.bashrc does not exist, and\n>$PATH\n-bash: /Volumes/0/z/android:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/X11/bin: No such file or directory\n\nWhat should I do?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can remedy things in your current shell by doing:\nmkdir -p /usr/local/sbin\nexport PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/sbin\nbrew link iftop\n\nThat'll get you past the warnings and let Homebrew install the iftop package.

I'm still not a busyness owner (but I may became one) and it is scary for me to. \nAs far as I know Apple software is protected by DMCA and recent versions don't even have a box version. DMCA is US law and it means nothing to local police, to confirm the legality of the software the license agreement or license to use the software is required. Such agreements must be on paper otherwise they are have no legal power. \nSo question is how to get written (on paper) license agreement or license to use the software (Apple OSX)?\n\n1 It's called 'УБЕЗ' in Ukraine and 'ОБЭП' in Russia.\n\nI've already asked related questions on Russian Google Answers, but I couldn't come up with a better place for this question than this site.\n\nA: The operating system is covered by the Apple End User License Agreement (EULA) and you can find it in PDF form on this page.

I have a MacBook Pro and have been single-booting Linux on it for some time. I now need to do some iOS development for work, so I need access to OS X in some form.\nI could dual-boot or virtualize Linux on OS X, but I'd really much rather keep Linux as my main OS and not have to reboot to start doing iOS work.\nI've read that Lion's license explicitly allows virtualizing on Apple hardware.\nDoes that permission extend to virtualizing within Linux?\nIf yes, how would I go about setting that up?\nIf it matters, my laptop shipped with a physical copy of OS X Snow Leopard. I will not do anything that violates the Apple EULA so please do not suggest anything just because I might be able to get away with it.\n\nA: Unfortunately you cannot virtualize OS X Lion under any other OS except OS X Lion.

I never use Spotlight to access files, I only use it to launch applications.\nAre there any risks in disabling it? Is there an Apple recommended way to disabling it?\nHow would I re-enable it later on if I want to?\n\nA: In addition to @jmlumpkin's Terminal command, you could simply add your entire hard drive to the Privacy tab in Spotlight preferences. You'd also want to add any external hard drives you regularly plug in. \nThe same caveat applies: you wouldn't be able to use it as an application launcher, so you'd need to get something like Quicksilver or LaunchBar.\nTo re-enable, just remove the relevant entries from the list in the Privacy tab.\n\nA: To disable, open Terminal and run\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nThis disables the Launch Daemon that starts and keeps it running. You can also run: \nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\nbut from looking online in a few places, this may give you an error like 'Spotlight server is disabled'\nIf you disable though, it will continue to use an old cache, or not work at all. Therefore, the launching applications as you mention will no longer work. It also may break other functions related to the OS, like the Mac App Store (to know whats installed, etc), and LaunchPad. \nIf you still need an application launcher, you can use applications like LaunchBar and Quicksilver.\nAfter seeing your update (espc. on how to stop it indexing so much), there are two things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you running something like a virus scanner or other application constantly accessing files on your drive? This will force spotlight to keep indexing. A network share would also be a culprit. \n\n*You can also filter what folders Spotlight should index, and by configuring this, can limit how much has to be indexed. Do do this, go to System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy. \n\n\n\nRe-enabling would be running \nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nor \nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\n", "Q: Genius problems with iTunes and Match I have iTunes (10.6 40) and Match on my mac, as soon as I enabled match my \"genius\" playlists no longer work.\nIf I click genius on a track that is playing it says:\n\nGenius is unavailable for the song \"Don't Drop It\"\n\nI click \"Update Genius\" and it says that the results have been updated, but never makes it available.\nI have over 10K songs, so surely it can find a genius result for a G-Love or Jack Johnson song... but it never does.\nThanks.\n\nA: Click the iCloud download icon to download the song to the computer you're using, and then try again.\nAn edit: This has only worked sporadically for me.\n", "Q: How to to specify pronunciations for OS X Lion? The text-to-speech function on Mac OS X Lion is quite good, although sometimes it misses the just-right pronunciation of a word.\nIs there a way to specify a pronunciation for certain words or phrases in Lion?\nFor example, let's say my friend's name is \"Tony\", and the voice for OS X (Alex) pronounces Tony \"tooney\". Is there a way that I can set Tony to be pronounced the same way Alex pronounces \"Toe Nee\"?\n\nA: You can also use [[inpt PHON]]:\n [[inpt PHON]]_t1OW ~n2EY.[[inpt TEXT]]\n\nSee the Speech Synthesis Programming Guide.\nIf you download the Auxiliary Tools for Xcode package from https://developer.apple.com/downloads, you can use the Repeat After Me application to convert text to the phonetic syntax:\n\n\nA: Open Applications > Services > VoiceOver Utility and go to Speech > Pronunciation. Add a subsitution for \"Tony\" and tell it to pronounce it as \"toe nee\".\n\nInterestingly, my computer running 10.7.3 with the Alex voice pronounces Tony correctly. Because of this, I wasn't able to test this solution, so it may not work.\n", "Q: How can I control iTunes from another Mac? I've got a Mac Mini running Lion that stores my iTunes library. It's hooked up to my receiver and speaker system, so it's the preferred machine for playing tunes from. I'd like to be able to control iTunes from my MacBook Pro, also running Lion, connected to the same WiFi network. \nI can use Screen Sharing, but that's a tad resource-intensive to leave running all the time on my mid-2009 MBP. iTunes Remote Control does exactly what I am looking for, but - call me superficial if you like - it doesn't blend in on my desktop. I would ideally like something a little OSXier, or at least alternatively to use a utility with no interface at all - just keyboard shortcuts.\nThat's a lot to ask for, and iTunes Remote Control will probably be my best bet, but I am hoping somebody here has a perfect solution for me. \n\nA: I've been using TuneConnect to do pretty much what you're after. It's got, what I consider to be, a much nicer UI that iTunes Remote Control. You install a server component on your iTunes machine and the remote component on the machine you want to control iTunes from and it just...works.\nI've been running it without any issues on Lion. It ran well for me on Snow Leopard as well.\n\n\n\nA: http://code.google.com/p/tunesremote-se/\n\nTunesRemote SE helps you remote control your DACP-compatible media player from another computer running Java. DACP compatible media players include:\n\n*\n\n*Apple iTunes (Tested working)\n\n*MonkeyTunes for MediaMonkey (Confirmed working)\n\n*AlbumPlayer\n\n*Telescope for Songbird\n\n*foo_touchremote for Foobar2000\n\n*RhythmBox for Gnome\n\n'Digital Audio Control Protocol' (DACP) is a protocol used by the Apple Inc.'s Remote application (app) on the iPhone to control iTunes running on a remote computer. By implementing this protocol TunesRemote SE allows any desktop or laptop to be used as remote control for your media.\nTunesRemote SE combines the graphical user interface of Firefly Client with the DACP control software from TunesRemote+.\n\n", "Q: Inexpensive game pad for OS X? I'm setting up a Mac mini for my entertainment center, and would occasionally like to be able to play games withough having to set up the keyboard and mouse.\nAre there cheap Bluetooth game pads that would be suitable for moderate action games, such as Portal 2?\nI don't need fast twitch gaming, and if it could double as the remote for plex or mythtv that would be better.\nCost is a big issue, though.  I've had to fish out more than a few things from the fish tank due to the kids.\n\nA: Macally makes two USB-based game controllers that are OS X compatible. Both are around USD$30 at the time of writing on Amazon.\nMacally ISHOCKX\n\nMacally ISHOCKII\n\nSony DualShock 3\n\nYou can also pair a Sony Playstation DualShock 3 bluetooth wireless controller with OS X without the need for any additional drivers. Everything you need is built right in to Snow Leopard and Lion.\nPress the PlayStation logo on the controller and OS X should show the controller in the list of available devices to pair with under the BlueTooth menu bar list. Once paired you'll need to map the buttons to key actions so it works with your games. For that  you can use the GamePad Companion app from the App Store.\n\nA: DarwiinRemote.app allows you to wirelessly connect a Wii Remote via Bluetooth and map each button to a key on the keyboard. Wii Remotes can be bought separately and are relatively cheap.\n\nFor a SNES emulator you’ll need to map the X and Y buttons. If you have a Wii Classic Controller, you can use it with DarwiinRemote.app as well. You may, however, need to apply this patch.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the DarwiinRemote setup I use for playing Donkey Kong on SNES using my Wii controller:\n\nNote that the up, left, down and right buttons on the Wii Remote map to different directions, because I’m holding the Wii Remote as a game pad rather than pointing it to the screen (as you would do for most Wii games).\nIf you’re feeling retro and you still have an old SNES controller laying around, you can buy a USB Super RetroPort which essentially adds a SNES controller port to your MacBook.\n\nIf you don’t have a SNES controller, you can buy a USB Super RetroPad which is a SNES controller that plugs directly into an USB port.\n\nP.S. I’ve posted the same question on gaming.stackexchange.com two years ago (back when those questions were still allowed).\n\nA: Any Xbox or PS3 controller can be used with OS X either via Bluetooth or USB. Gamepad Controller is a great Mac app for programming the controls/actions.\n", "Q: Installing VMware-Windows for all users There are two problems with VMware installing Windows in ~/Documents:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiple OS X users cannot use the same Windows installation.\n\n*Even one inadvertent omission to exclude ~/Documents from the Time Machine backup means that a heavy penalty will be paid on the TM disk.\n\n\nHow does one install Windows through VMware in a more neutral fashion, perhaps in a separate partition, to make windows accessible by all OS X accounts?\nAt the risk of getting the two-question police after me, I will venture with a sequel: can one move one's ~/Documents/Virtual Machine.localized/ to a new partition or is it necessary to restart the installation of windows? \n\nA: It looks like you can safely move an existing vmware virtual machine - http://www.splashofstyle.com/archives/2009/01/31/moving-a-wmware-fusion-virtual-machine/\n\nA: You can choose a different location in the \"New Virtual Machine Assistant\" by clicking \"Customize Settings\" in the last step of the assistant. Definitely not an intuitive way to go about it.\n\nYou can also move an existing VM. To do this, you move the VM to the new location, launch VMWare Fusion, drag the VM from its new location to the \"Virtual Machine Library\" window, and delete the old VM from the \"Virtual Machine Library\" (the old one will have a question mark as its preview because it's pointing to the old location).\nAs @binarybob pointed out in the comments, if the VM is moved to a shared location (e.g. an external HD or /Users/Shared/) then other users will have access to the VM.\nExample:\nThe selected VM will be moved:\n\nAfter moving the VM in the Finder, VMWare will show the VM as missing:\n\nDrag the moved VM from its new location in the Finder to the \"Virtual Machine Library\" window:\n\nDelete the old VM (with the question mark as the preview) from the VM Library. This will only delete VMWare's reference to the old location, it won't do anything to the VM itself.\nWhen you open the VM after being moved, VMWare will ask you if you moved or copied it. Because you moved it, choose \"I moved it\".\n\n", "Q: iPhone/iPad unable to see iMac/Apple TV until router reboot (affects AirPlay, Remote app, Wi-Fi sync) Every few days my iPhone (4) and/or iPad (3rd generation) lose their ability to \"see\" my iMac and/or Apple TV on the network. This means:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Remote app shows zero sources available for Home Sharing (normally will show both the iMac and the Apple TV)\n\n*AirPlay cannot be used to send audio or video to the Apple TV\n\n*Wi-Fi sync will not work (states that it will resume when iMac is available)\n\n\nPower cycling my router (a Linksys E2000) fixes the problem temporarily, but it always comes back.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Sounds like a router problem.  Bonjour/Zeroconf uses multicast to reach all hosts on the network - if the router treats these incorrectly you have the problem.\nIf the rest of the network works correctly, then the simplest thing might simply be to replace the master router of your network with an Apple router (they tend to work well with Apple units) and set the current router to be just the internet uplink.\n\nA: I have had similar issues with an iPod touch and having it reliably connect to other (non Apple) home networking equipment. \nThere are too many variables in your set up described above to diagnose an exact problem. But the types of things you want to try are:\n1- Further problem isolation.\nYou have found that rebooting the router fixes the problem. But what about rebooting just the iPhone? Or rebooting the computer? How about if you just turn the WiFi on the iPhone off then on? Do the iPhone and the iPad leave the house during this time and connect to other networks? What happens if you leave the device in the house for a few days?\n2- Depending on the outcomes of the testing above\nYou might want to try using fixed IP addresses for some or all of your networking components. You do this on the iPhone in Settings->WiFi->YourNetwork->Static. If you are not familiar with this sort of stuff note down the settings on the DHCP tab and copy them into the Static tab. You can always change back to DHCP if things get messed up. I use fixed IP addresses on my iPod touch to mostly solve my problem. See here: http://www.net.princeton.edu/apple-ios/ios41-allows-lease-to-expire-keeps-using-IP-address.html for highly detailed information about a DHCP bug in iOS.\n\nA: Enabling IGMP snooping in my Asus RT-56U router seems to have fixed this problem. I followed this blogpost:\nhttp://bendera.blogspot.nl/2013/07/asus-rt-n56u-settings-for-airplay.html\nEnabling multicast in your router might solve the issue as well. This is what Airplay devices use to detect each other, apparently.\n", "Q: Is there any way to record video on an iPhone 3G? My friend has an iPhone 3G, and is wondering if there's any way to record video on the iPhone 3G.\nI believe the latest iOS update available for the iPhone 3G didn't enable the video feature and that it was only introduced with the iPhone 3GS. Are there any good apps which enable this feature? Ideally, my friend is looking for a free solution.\n\nA: Correct, and yes.\nHere's one you can try: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/record-video-for-free-iphone/id376582359?mt=8\nYou can probably find others by searching 'free video recorder iphone 3g'.\nYou will also find some extra options on Cydia if your phone is jailbroken.\n", "Q: OS X equivalent of Windows keyboard commands to access in-application menus? In Windows, I often use the keyboard commands to navigate through the menus in a program.  For example, in Photoshop, I can do Alt+F, then D to quickly Save for Web & Devices.  Or Alt+V, then D to Clear Guides.  This is great when there is no keyboard command for a menu item that I want to use, or the existing keyboard command requires too many fingers.  \nHow can I translate this functionality to OS X (OS X 10.5.8 in case it matters)?  How can I navigation through an applications's menus using keyboard commands?\n\nA: You can use Ctrl + F2, which moves the focus to the  symbol in the menu bar. Then use the arrow keys to move around, or just type the start of a menu name to highlight it. With a menu name highlighted, hit Space to expand it. In an open menu, you can type the start of a menu item to highlight it. Once highlighted, press Space again to “click” it.\nSo, to get to “Save for Web & Devices” in Photoshop, you could press Ctrl + F2, F, Space, Enter, S, ↓ until you focus “Save for Web & Devices”, then Space.\nOf course, the built-in keyboard shortcut for that option is much easier to type: ⌥ + ⇧ + ⌘ + S.\n\n\nA: You could also assign shortcuts to AppleScripts like this with an app like Alfred or FastScripts:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)\n    click menu bar 1's menu bar item 3 -- usually File\nend tell\n\nThey won't work in full screen though. And it's not that much faster than just using a mouse really.\nYou can also trigger menu items by searching after focusing the help menu with ⌘+?.\n", "Q: High resolution drawing app for iPad I'm looking for a good app that I and kids at my home can use to draw pictures on the iPad. I've used many of the free apps, like Chalk Pad and so on, but I notice that each of these comes with a lag.\nWhat's a good app which helps you draw great looking pictures and has a minimum amount of time lag? I'd prefer free apps, though mentioning paid apps won't hurt.\n\nA: My girlfriend uses iDraw for vector picture drawing. It’s not free, but it’s the best iPad drawing app I’ve seen. It also has an OS X version.\n\n\nA: I like Procreate.  It isn't free, but it's inexpensive and is an excellent drawing package with minimal to no lag, and it does support the new iPad's HD canvas.\n\n", "Q: VMware Windows and resizing the desktop So I install two Windows 7 VMs through VMware fusion 4. The desktop resizes very nicely in the first: Windows senses the resizing and uses smaller icons.\nIn the second VM Windows simply magnifies its desktop to a rather ugly one: the desktop uses more real estate, but it's just a magnified image of a low-resolution desktop.\nI'm not aware that I have changed any setting related to the desktop. How can one intentionally get the former behavior?\n\nA: Sounds like you might not have VMware Tools installed in the second VM. Do you see the VMware Tools icon in the taskbar tray?\n\nIf not, you can select \"Install VMware Tools\" from the \"Virtual Machine\" menu (mine says \"Reinstall\" as I already have it installed)\n\n", "Q: Bad WiFi reception when using external screen I know it doesn't make any sense (at least, it doesn't to me), but I have the strangest situation over here: \nUpstairs:\nI use a MacBook Pro (mid 2010) with a i7 2.66 GHz processor and 4GB of DDR3. The notebook is on my desk on my right side. I've connected a 23\" ACD as external screen. When the screen is connected, the lid is closed.  \nDownstairs:\nAirPort Extreme (4th generation) which sends a signal (n-standard) to my Mac (and all other devices in our house).\nFor some reason, when the external ACD is connected I got a very bad signal. Signal strength even goes down to 1 sometimes. But when the ACD is disconnected and the lid is opened, the signal strength increases to normal proportions (40-80).\nI can't figure out why the signal strength is influenced by connecting the ACD or not.\nCan you?\n\nA: I may have an answer for you.\nThe AirPort card in this model is located at about where the play/pause and volume buttons  are and the antennas are built into the display. When you close the lid, the antennas are being pointed sideways instead of up. \nNot only that, but now you've added an extra layer of glass and aluminum to block the radio waves being transmitted from your AirPort card to your AirPort Extreme. This is probably what's causing the issue.\nThere's not really a fix for this, as it's how the MacBook Pro was designed. \nA workaround, however, would be to leave your MacBook Pro lid open when connected to your display. If you prefer your main screen to be the external display, you can change which display is primary. There are some pretty good instructions out there that explain how to do this.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone keep asking me for passwords for random WiFi networks? My iPhone 3GS running iOS 5.1 (although this also happened when running 4.3) keeps interrupting whatever I do with it (I might be playing a game or browsing the Web) with a dialogue asking me to enter a password for some WiFi network the phone appears to have found in the vicinity.\nIt's very annoying.\nIn the Wi-Fi Networks settings \"Ask to Join Networks\" is set to \"off\".\nWhy does my iPhone do that and how can I get it to stop doing that?\n\nA: That must be annoying, and you have identified the correct place that should turn the feature off, which clearly isn't working.  So it's not really a problem we can identify with as we are unlikely to be able to recreate it for start.\nAs with lots of this type of problem, there is no way we can help assist with identifying exactly why it's doing it, other than noting that it is likely transient behaviour and provide some possible steps to try and fix it, which veers us into the realm of off-topic answers as there is no way of knowing if this \"answer\" can solve it for you.\nBut with this in mind, I would try the following steps, in this order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Wifi Off and On.  If this does not solve it:\n\n*Turn Ask to Join Networks On and Off.  If this does not solve it:\n\n*Turn Wifi Off, turn Ask to Join Networks Off, and reboot your phone, then turn Wifi On\n\n*If none of the above solves it, I would consider connecting to iTunes, backing up your device fully, performing an OS re-install, then recovering from your backup.  This is last resort, but if none of the first 3 steps fix it, it's likely that there is some corruption of the settings for your Wifi which may only be fixed by replacing with a clean setup.\n\nA: Maybe these networks have the same name as a network you have joined?  (One of those \"default\" names, like NETGEAR and such, that haven't been changed.)  So then your iPhone thinks it is a network it is supposed to join, but the password it knows doesn't work, and it asks you for the \"new\" password.\n\nA: The ask to join networks 'on' only prevents the phone from auto joining without your permission. Turn that off to get fewer prompts. The phone decides after it has seen a network for a while that it must be yours or a hotel and helps you join it. This is what i'm trying to figure out how to stop as its my neighbors network and i dont have the pass phrase\nAlso, after upgrading and restoring my phone it now asks this on all previously known networks so a plist carried over after a restore causes it more as well.\n\nA: Try this:\nSettings,\nWifi,\nHit the blue \"i\" in the circle to the right of your server name,\nChoose HTTP PROXY \"auto\"\n", "Q: TextEdit removes Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) from Unicode/UTF files. How to fix? I'm working with UTF-8 files, but TextEdit seems to not fully support the BOM. When a BOM is present, it DOES render unicode characters correctly. However, upon saving the file, the BOM is removed, so subsequently opening the file in TextEdit causes 'the wrong' characters to be displayed.\nIs there a way of remedying this? Bear in mind I'm sharing files with several non-technical users, so anything related to the command-line is out of the question. If the solution is 'use another text editor', this might just about be acceptable, if it's free, and not totally different from TextEdit - i.e. the simpler, the better. But, ideally, there's a way of fixing TextEdit ...\n\nA: This isn't the main solution you're looking for, but TextWrangler is free, handles UTF-8 (and many other encodings) very well, and doesn't have too steep a learning curve, particularly if you're just using functionality similar to TextEdit. I know you'd like to fix TextEdit, and I hope you get an answer explaining how to do that, but in the absence of a primary solution, this should be a good backup plan.\n\nA: TextEdit → Preferences → Open and Save\n\nSet “Plain Text File Encoding” to “Unicode (UTF-8)” for both opening and saving files.\nIf that doesn’t fix it already, open Terminal.app and enter the following:\necho \"0x08000100:0\" > ~/.CFUserTextEncoding\n\nThen logout and login again.\nThis fixes the ancient UTF-8 bug in OS X that also manifest in QuickLook.\nTo fix it for just a single file rather than for all files (I don’t see why you would, though), just write the extended attribute that TextEdit uses:\nxattr -w com.apple.TextEncoding 'UTF-8;134217984' filename.txt\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I think using TextWrangler to always save as \"UTF-8 with BOM\" is the best way to make sure all other systems will see your files as UTF-8.  Another option would be to use UTF-16 instead, but that is unusual and could confuse some users.\n", "Q: Is surround sound easy on a mac? My iMac, Macbook Pro, and Mac Mini all have only one stereo audio output each - none of them have digital audio output either (though perhaps other models do?).\n\n\n*\n\n*Does OS X support surround sound?\n\n*Are there surround sound output devices (USB, presumably) for OS X, or does the HDMI output (via displaylink adaptor) of later models support surround sound?\n\n*Does iTunes, Quicktime, or any other video software output surround sound for SD or HD movies, assuming you have an appropriate output device?\nI know this could be three separate questions, but the base question I'm really interested in knowing is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use a Mac as my primary entertainment device and easily get surround sound out of it for most applications, or is it going to be limited and/or difficult to set up?\n\n\nI currently use a windows PC for my TV Tuner, Blueray, DVD, and Netflix all of which support surround sound, and they simply all work together without problems.  Is the Mac any easier or harder to do this with?\n\nA: In terms of hardware, according to Mactracker, Mac Minis (and most other Macs) since early 2006 come with a 3.5-mm analog/optical combo jack and models since mid 2010 also come with an HDMI port, both of which should support multichannel audio if your source material provides it. You can find the specs for your own Mac by clicking the \"This Mac\" item in the left-hand pane.\nSpecs for the current (Mid 2011) Mac Mini say:\n\nHDMI port supports multichannel audio output\n\nand for most of the other models, as an alternative to the 3.5-mm analog/optical combo jack, this Apple support page says that you can also use a mini Display port to HDMI adapter to receive multichannel audio and video (though I'm not sure what software support for this would be like):\n\nThese computers supply multichannel audio (up to 8 channels) and video\n  signals over Mini DisplayPort:\nMacBook (Mid 2010) and later \nMacBook Air (Late 2010) and later \nMacBook Pro (Mid 2010) and later \nMac mini (Mid 2010) and later \niMac (Late 2009) and later \nMac Pro (Mid 2010) \nTo connect your television or other\n  HDMI devices to your Mac, use select third-party Mini DisplayPort to\n  HDMI adapters that conform to the VESA v1.1a DisplayPort\n  Interoperability Guidelines\n\nDepending on the software player, it should be just a question of connecting the HDMI/optical output to your recevier and getting multichannel output. I use XBMC and get 5.1 surround sound output (AC3 or DTS) over HDMI, and I believe the latest \"Eden\" release supports 7.1. It also does blu-ray (rips only, I assume), DVD and has an excellent plug-in system which includes Netflix. Alternatively, Plex is an another alternative and will do much the same thing. Once you get your media set up, both will work pretty much out-of-the-box.\nAs for a TV tuner, Elgato's EyeTV looks very good.\n\nA: Most Macs have supported optical output for a while. But if yours did not, what you can do is buy an external one (via USB or FireWire) and by so, you'll be able to connect to you surround system. I know Hercules has some good ones.\nTo answer your applications question:  \nI know following applications support multichannel playback (only if you have mulitchannel sources ofcourse!) : \n\n\n*\n\n*QuickTime (and QuickTime HD trailers)\n\n*iTunes\n\n*Front Row \n\n*VLC  \n\n\nAlso you will not get surround from the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*CDs\n\n*iTunes Music\n\n*Web content\n\n*dts encoded WAV files\n\n\nIf you want to setup iTunes Movies and DVD player to be able to handle surround sound, I suggest you take a look at the Apple Support pages.\nSo, yes, it's easy to set up surround sound, once you've the required equipment. \n\nA: To directly answer your base question, it is actually very easy to set up surround sound and use a Mac as a primary entertainment device. The Mac is just as easy to do this with.  A lot of people do this, especially with Mac Minis. Up until recently, I had a 2009 Mini doing this, with optical out directly to my Onkyo receiver. I ordered the cable from Monoprice, plugged it in, and in many cases, the OS automatically knows to do optical audio.  \nYou also may want to look into a central app to manage all this for you, like Plex. Plex lets you access your media (including iTunes, Netflix, etc), and is especially made for the Mac, using Mac OS specific APIs and libraries. \nJust remember, your source must contain multiple channels to get the full effect of this. Otherwise, the audio will work just fine out to your receiver, just not in surround (unless your receiver is changing it)\n", "Q: Lion Recovery Terminal will not allow me to run TestDisk? Setup: Macbook Air (2011) running Lion with BootCamp (Windows 7).\nProblem: I have somehow screwed up my partition table. When I boot I only can select Windows instead of Windows and Lion. However Windows gives a BSOD regardless of safe mode option selected. \nMy Attempt: I have booted into Lion Recovery and tried running Disk Utility to repair disk volumes but it fails. Also tried to reinstall Lion but unable to because Lion doesn't recognize disk volumes (however it does see that there are two main partitions but they are grayed out). \nI have data on both partitions I would like to recover so I am trying to use TestDisk to rebuild the partition table, but when I launch TestDisk from my external thumbdrive I get \"Illegal instruction: 4\".\n\nA: Have you tried booting from a Linux LiveCD (well, instead of a CD, you'll need a USB thumb drive, but it's the same idea)? From there you could copy data to an external hard drive and just wipe the internal hard drive and reinstall.\nIf you have another Mac laying around with Thunderbolt, you can boot your Mac into Target Disk Mode (hold down T while booting), connect the Macs together with a Thunderbolt cable, and perform any disk recovery from there. (You might be able to go to an Apple Store and use one of their Thunderbolt Macs to recover your drive; they can be surprisingly permissive at times.)\n\nA: I did almost the same exact thing to my mac too. Here are some good resources/sites that may help you get started fixing this, or a similar, issue:\nBackup you files before attempting repairs. (Also some of the comments on this site may be helpful too.)\nHere is a link to a data recovery program that I saw a local Mac repairman use. But you do have to pay for it, and I can't guaranty that it will be anymore helpful than the simple freeware above. But it does seem to have a nice interface, and offers a trial version if you want to try it.\n", "Q: Occasional system hangups after upgrade to Lion: is it a disk or software problem? I have an 13 inch MacBook unibody Alu (early 2009, before they started to be called MacBook Pro) that I use every day for many hours (it's my work and life computer). Few weeks ago within few days I upgraded the RAM to 8Gb and the harddrive to Samsung 1TB HN-M101MBB (I cloned my old drive to the new one with SuperDuper). These were the first changes to the hardware (apart from new battery) I did from the original configuration. After using computer for few more days with Snow Leopard, I upgraded to Lion.\nSince then, every week or so my computer freezes completely without apparent reason and no good explanation. I get notifications either that my harddrive was corrupted, or very cryptic message that (some application name, ie Mailplane or Papers) database was corrupted and it cannot write to disk \"T\" (I have no such drive). When I hard-reboot the computer, it can't find the home disk. When I reboot it again with option key and select recovery drive and run disk utility, it always reports that my home disk 'appears to be OK'. After another restart everything is back to normal again.\nI have never had such problems before the Lion upgrade, but I am not sure if it's the software or the new harddrive. Any hint on what can be wrong and how to fix it would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks,\nYot\n\nA: Nobody will tell you for sure (without diagnosing a problem), but you should definitely check both your harddrive and memory (corrupted memory may cause data loss while writing to HD. I had such a problem twice in my life.)\nI prefere non-OS specific utilities:\nSystemResqueCD\nYou can install it either on CD or on USB flash drive.\nIt contains a lot of diagnostic utils. One of them is memtest86+ which you can use to test you memory.\nMemtest86+\nIt's is one of the most recognized software diagnostic tools on the planet. Since 2008 it supports Apple hardware. It checks memory by writing different binary patterns and checking what's actually stored in memory.\n\nRed means bad\nMHDD\nOfficial site of this utility is dead, but you can find in here.\nThat's what you need to check your hard disk drive. I'm not sure that it will work on Apple hardware, but you can plug your hard drive in any PC or in external USB enclosure and check there.\n\n\nA: It was a software problem, specifically a botched Google Chrome complaining about 'not being signed in to Chrome'. I have never signed up to Chrome (I am the only user) and never attempted to do so. \nWhile I am not sure of this, all the above problems disappeared once I removed and re-installed Chrome. None of the hardware or software tests I run showed problems to my hardware or system.\n", "Q: How do I tell if my Mac supports Mini Toslink? Apparently on many modern macs the 3.5mm headphone audio jack supports Mini Toslink.\nHow can I tell whether my mac supports it, whether it supports surround sound (4 speaker or better), and whether the microphone input acts as a mini toslink input?\n\nA: While not specific to mini TOSLINK, Apple lists all their 192kHz-compatible models on their \"Play high sample rate digital audio on Mac computers\" article. (The wording makes it sound like some machines supporting 176.4kHz may not be listed, though.)\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) through MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) through MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\n\n*iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2014) through iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2014)\n\n*iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, Late 2015)\n\n*iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) through iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)\n\n*Mac Pro (Late 2013)\n\n*Mac mini (Late 2014)\n\n\nA: Take a look at Mactracker.

As titled, is there anyway I can disable it? \nSometimes when I close a TextEdit window or whatever application, I really want to purge it. But when I open the application again, the same text that I didn't want appear again, and that is really annoying.\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, you can disable Versions globally, I described it here:\nHow to disable Versions in OS X Lion\nI found a way to disable Versions (not Autosave) in a (hopefully) non-destructive reversible way: (re)move the SQLite database that Versions uses\nCareful, this comes with absolutely no warranty and may break your system!\nsudo mv /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1 /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1_off; sudo touch /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo killall revisiond\nIf it worked you'll be notified e.g. in Textedit when you close a document:\n\nThat (probably) means that your document will still be automatically saved in certain intervals, but once you close it (or the program) you can only retrieve the latest version (and Time Machine backups, if available).\nThe changes can be undone with sudo rm /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo mv /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1_off /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo killall revisiond\n\nEdit 2012-04-04:\nVersions (especially of Autosave) may still end up in ~/Library/Containers as nicely described in this answer.\n\nA: There has been a long discussion on the Discussions fora of Apple. A lot of people are complaining about it, but as far as I know, there isn't a solid solution at the moment.\nIt seems the app-maker can decide wheter or not to include the 'Versions' option. So the only guess I can make is to return to a previous version of the app. In case of TextEdit, it would mean you have to go back to Snow Leopard, which is clearly not a good option.\nYou can always try to tell Apple about your findings, maybe if a lot of people do so (and it looks like it), Apple will consider a new way of handling the versions. \n\nA: Auto save cannot be disabled in OS X Lion.  There are a few things you can do that work around it a little, but don't seem to resolve the problem completely:\n\n\n*\n\n*For individual documents, \"lock\" the document by clicking the little icon in the center of the title bar and choosing lock.\n\n*System wide (doesn't work for every app), go to System Preferences, select General, then uncheck \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps.\"\n\n*Use a script to delete the versions file(s) periodically, or on shutdown.\n\n*Use a script to delete the versions directory on startup, thus preventing apps from storing versions in the first place\n\n\nFor the third option, one possible script is:\n--{code}\n--[SCRIPT deleteRevisions]\nmy deleteRevisions(path to startup disk as text)\n-- my deleteRevisions(\"Aluice-500-Lion:\")\n\non deleteRevisions(leVolume)\n          local leDossier, cheminUnix\n          set leDossier to leVolume & \".DocumentRevisions-V100:\"\n          set cheminUnix to quoted form of POSIX path of leDossier\n\n  --  do shell script \"stat -F \" & cheminUnix\n  --> \"d--x--x--x 7 root wheel 238 Aug  7 11:21:07 2011 /.DocumentRevisions-V100//\"\n\n  do shell script \"chmod 700 \" & cheminUnix with administrator privileges\n\n  --  do shell script \"stat -F \" & cheminUnix\n  --> \"drwx------ 7 root wheel 238 Aug  7 15:47:00 2011 /.DocumentRevisions-V100//\"\n\n  do shell script \"rm -dfr \" & cheminUnix with administrator privileges\n  --> \"\"\nend deleteRevisions\n\n--=====\n--[/SCRIPT]\n--{code}\n\nSome users have reported that some apps use different app-specific directories and so the above doesn't work completely, but takes care of the simple apps.\nFor the fourth option, a startup script might be:\n--{code}\n--[SCRIPT deleteApplicationsState]\n\nset leDossier to (path to library folder from user domain as text) & \"Saved Application State:\"\n\nset cheminUnix to quoted form of POSIX path of leDossier\n\ndo shell script \"chmod 700 \" & cheminUnix --with administrator privileges\"\n\ndo shell script \"rm -dfr \" & cheminUnix --with administrator privileges\n--> \"\"\n\n--=====\n--[/SCRIPT]\n--{code}\n\nAgain, it doesn't account for apps that store their versions elsewhere.\n\nA: After a quick Google, it looks like there isn't. Though I did find this related post on Super User. Apparently you can do it in TextEdit (I'm not at my Mac) by going to Preferences > Open and Save > Savings Files. Applications handle this differently, so there is no system-wide setting yet.\n", "Q: Adding tags to files in OS X: How to use, where are tags stored, and will they work on a network? I've heard it is possible to add tags to a file's meta data in OS X, and have Spotlight search through such tags.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a nutshell, how would one access this feature in Finder – not Spotlight (Command+Space) – but the adding of tags themselves?\n\n*Where are these tags stored?  Do they go in .DS_Store (I tend to delete those!) or elsewhere in the filesystem?\n\n*Does this tagging mechanism work on removable drives?  What are the requirements?\n\n*Does this tagging mechanism work over a network share?  I have some Windows SMB network shares at home that I frequently store files on.  Would it work on those or is another configuration required?\n\n*Aside from Spotlight, are there any command-line tools for searching through or accessing the tag data for files?\nThank you!\n\nA: \nIn a nutshell, how would one access this feature in Finder – not Spotlight (Command+Space) – but the adding of tags themselves?\n\nFrom Finder, highlight a file and hit Cmd-I (or right click and select Get Info) to bring up the File Info Dialog for the file. In this dialog, the Spotlight Comments field is where you add tag data. Just add text to this field to \"tag\" the file.\nHere's a good article on how to become a meta-data wizard in OS X:\nhttps://gigaom.com/2007/02/01/using-metadata-effectively-in-os-x/\n\nIf was tagging that screen capture, I might use the following in the comments box:\ncustomer-name presentation product-name\n\nSo that I could find that screen shot by the customer, or by the fact that it's being used in a presentation, or by the name of the product I'm showing them.\n\nWhere are these tags stored? Do they go in .DS_Store (I tend to delete those!) or elsewhere in the filesystem?\n\nYes, they're stored in the .DS_Store files you see in each folder. These files are read by Finder. The information is also stored in Extended Attributes (EAs) on the files themselves. Spotlight will prefer to read the data from EAs. EAs are a feature of the HFS+ filesystem, so remote filesystems might not necessarily have EAs available on files. In these cases, .DS_Store files are the fallback. Spotlight would also have a tag <-> file mapping section in its database but that's only accessible to Spotlight.\n\nDoes this tagging mechanism work on removable drives? What are the requirements?\n\nGenerally: yes. You can add tags to files and folders on removable drives and remote shares. Unless you've turned off .DS_Store creation on remote shares, OS X will just add these files and keep the meta-data there for you.\n\nDoes this tagging mechanism work over a network share? I have some Windows SMB network shares at home that I frequently store files on. Would it work on those or is another configuration required?\n\nYes, see above. If you didn't want OS X to do this, run:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true\nAnd then restart Finder.\n\nAside from Spotlight, are there any command-line tools for searching through or accessing the tag data for files?\n\nLots!\nHere's a list of 7 file-tagging applications for OS X: http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/utilities-roundups/7-file-tagging-applications-for-os-x/\nI personally love and use LaunchBar which is like Spotlight on steroids.\n", "Q: No Sound from Mac Mini after OS X Server Reinstall I had to reinstall OS X Lion Server 10.7 on my Mac mini (late 2011) due to partition and boot record corruption.

Any ideas out there? Solutions? I've been through the Cmd-P-R deal, reinstalled OS X Lion Server - all to no avail. \n\nA: Go to ~/Library/Preferences and trash your com.apple.systemsound.plist file. Drag it right into the trash. Empty trash and restart your Mac.\nA new plist file will generate automatically, look for the speaker/sound icon in your Finder menu. If that doesn't resolve the issue, try Command ⌘-Option ⌥-P-R again during reboot and make sure you hear the Apple chime at least two times for a full recycle.\n", "Q: Internet sharing over AirPort In MacOS X 10.6, is Internet sharing over AirPort implemented as NAT or full-blown routing? The backing wired network is a corporate one, Ethernet with DHCP.\n\nA: Can't find anything definitive from Apple, but the detailed testing done here by Princeton University indicates that it's NAT (and that it's inappropriate for use on their campus, so might well be for your scenario too).\n\nA: Type:\nps ax | egrep '[ /](PID|boo|nat)'\n\nin a Terminal or xterm window.\nFire InternetSharing from the System Preferences.

One of my earbud tips has been lost. I'd like to replace it. I'd prefer not to use a third-party service, as the quality of the material is never as high as Apple's.\nDo you know if Apple will replace them?\n\nA: I know it used to be not a big hassle to change them. You could just send them to Apple and a few days later, the new earbuds arrived. But since many people took advantage of this system, Apple came up with a limit (both in quantity as in warranty time). \nNow days, my best guess is to go to the Apple Store and ask if they will replace it.  \nBut why would you exclude non-Apple earbuds? There are some very good (and cheap) ones. For example on DealExtreme or even on eBay.\n\nA: Yes - call Apple Support, open a web ticket or visit a reseller or an Apple Store.

I'm following these instructions to use my mid-2009 MacBook Pro in clamshell mode with a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard and trackpad are paired with the computer and I've got the external display hooked up, but the computer is going to sleep when I shut the lid. I have Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer checked in System Preferences, so I can hit some keys to wake the computer while it's closed. It wakes up and shows me the lock screen, where I start typing my password... only to have the computer go right back to sleep after a second or two. \nWhy won't it stay awake?\nClamshell mode behaved properly when I was using a USB keyboard. \nI'm currently using NoSleep to work around this problem, but I'd like to know the root cause.\n\nA: The only time I have seen this model fail to work reliably is when there was a problem with the AC power (and it then was continually, but momentarily on battery and sleep is the correct answer) or when the lid isn't securely closed (a drop has bent things inside, or the lid doesn't close firmly, or the stand allows the lid to wiggle open/closed a touch.\nHave you poked around a bit to see if any of the things can be isolated (lid movement, power supply, connecting a USB device just to avoid a bluetooth drop from making it think it should sleep now).\nYou don't need these changes permanently, but just to isolate why it might work sometimes and not another. If it fails all the time, you might need it serviced since Lion has worked out most of the sleep/wake screen issues associated with clamshell mode. (and there sure were a lot on 10.6 when we didn't know the VRAM was being allocated, but not reallocated on lid opening events as described in the support article you mentioned)\n\nA: The power cord MUST Be Plugged in or the bluetooth devices will not wake the macbook.

(I know it's there - either Alt +3 or Shift + 3 - but I want to access with one button push).\nI've installed Ukelele as recommended in answers to this question but I was wondering whether anyone has any tips or recommendations about where to remap the has key to.\nAny suggestions would be most welcome.\nThank you!\n\nA: I assume you're on a non-US keyboard - my US mac keyboard has shift-3 as #, where my £ is on my UK keyboard.\nI think this rather depends on your key usage. Most normal users never use the ` or ~, so that top left key would work. I use them both quite a lot though.\nAnother alternative would be to use System Prefs to switch to the US layout. Most of the keys are exactly the same, and you'd get the usual shift-3 for #. Not quite one-button, but an easy solution, nonetheless.\nF5 and F6 doesn't get much use on my keyboard at all, nor do F13-F19.\n\nA: If you don’t need the § symbol frequently, you could remap that key to # instead. It’s on the left of the 1 key on a UK QWERTY keyboard, so it’s very easy to reach.\nI don’t remap # myself, but I know a few colleagues who do exactly this, because it makes it easier to write CSS.\nP.S. Since you’re starting out with Ukelele.app and custom keyboard layouts, you might be interested in this post of mine where I explain how to create, install, and use custom keyboard layouts.\n\nA: You may just want to install the standard UK layout:\nhttp://liyang.hu/osx-british.xhtml\n", "Q: How do I run VI with colors on Lion?
