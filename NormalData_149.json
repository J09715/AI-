["Q: Execute terminal command without opening terminal In terminal, I have an alias so that when I type note, a text document of my notes comes up. Often times when I'm browsing the web I'd like to make a quick note but I don't have terminal open, so I have to Shift-Alt-T to open terminal and then type `note'. And then I have to click off the terminal.\nIs there anyway to access terminal commands without opening the terminal so I don't have to do so many key presses? Maybe through a lens or HUD? Alt-note would be really nice.. I know I could map terminal to Alt, but then I'd still have to click off it.\n\nA: You can try to transform your alias in an executable and put it in your path.\nFor example you can put it in /usr/local/bin, that should be already in your path.\nThen you can launch that program by pressing AltF2 and entering the executable name.\n\nA: You could youse guake terminal\nWhat it does is actually run like a console, so when you press a button you defined it will pop up when you are finished just pres ESC and it will be again in the background.\n", "Q: Ask to install program after \"The program 'x' is currently not installed\" If you try to execute a program that is not installed you will get a message\nThe program 'x' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: \nsudo apt-get install x\n\nand instead of offering you to install the program for you, you have to type the actual command. How can this behavior be changed?\n\nA: The package that is responsible for this behavior is the command-not-found  package, and it already includes the desired behavior although it is disabled by default. You can enable it by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc\nexport COMMAND_NOT_FOUND_INSTALL_PROMPT=1\n\nNow the behavior is changed to\nThe program 'x' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install x\nDo you want to install it? (N/y)\n\n\nNote:\nIf you get a message about python crashing (specifically AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode') this is bug 1073919. A fix is already available for Raring and Saucy. Alternatively (advanced users only), you can change the file /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/CommandNotFound/CommandNotFound.py, see the diff attached to the bugreport for the lines that need to be changed.\nEdit: The fix is now released in version 0.3ubuntu7.1 in Raring (SRU) and for 0.3ubuntu8 in Saucy.\n\nA: My solution is an hybrid between security and comfortability:\n\nauto-apt checks the file access of programs running within its\n   environments, and if a program tries to access a file known to\n   belong in an uninstalled package, auto-apt will install that\n   package using apt-get.  This feature requires apt and sudo to work.\n   It also provides simple database to search which package contains\n   a requested file.\n\nIt's a terminal-emulator where you enter a environment where each file access is verified before hand by auto-apt and if it not exist it search in the database (a la apt-file) and download and install the desired package, then allows the program to continue. You should execute it as root:\nsudo auto-apt\n\nThis is useful in cases where you are building a package and isn't in the mood to be in front of the screen looking for each configure error for missing headers, etc.\nThis also can be used as apt-get + apt-file replacement where you can install programs just telling the command to execute it.\nYou must understand that you should not leave it opened when your system isn't looked, since it's almost as if you were using the root user.\nMan page: http://derpi.tuwien.ac.at/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+auto-apt\n\nA: Auto installing would be a bad idea. If you want to save some typing you can use\nsudo apt-get install !!\n\nwhere !! will be replaced by the last command from history. You probably could make this an alias as well, but I don't know how to add !! without evaluating it.\nThere are some caveats though, as mentioned by @eliah-kagan and @gertvdijk in the comments. Some programs doesn't have the same package name as the binary you would execute. Also, when passing arguments to the binary, this could result in some unexpected results.\n\nA: There are a few methods for quickly installing the suggested package:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add export COMMAND_NOT_FOUND_INSTALL_PROMPT=1 to somewhere like ~/.bashrc\nthis is the \"coolest\" way, although obviously not quite as safe, but probably 90% of the time will elicit an internal \"Thanks, that's exactly what I wanted you to do!\" response.\n(One personal drawback of this method is that I seem to find the answer difficult to remember/search for, so I tend not to have used it much so far.)\n\n*If you are using the default Terminal, you can quickly select the line and middle-click to paste it directly into the command line.  (Other terminals or SSH apps may have different methods.)\nIn practice, I tend to find this quick enough, and slightly harder to do \"accidentally\", and without requiring any prior setup, that I tend to do that instead.\n\n*There is something to be said, though - if you can (or want to learn to) type quickly - for typing out sudo apt install packagename directly.\nIt helps you exercise your muscle memory, and also means that you have to read and type the package name, meaning you're likely to remember it more easily in future.  It's also slightly easier in more recent Ubuntu versions, because apt works in place of apt-get.\n", "Q: launcher for a program not working - ubuntu 13.04 I'm using a program named \"robomongo\" (a mongoDB UI), but to run it I need to type in the terminal \"./robomongo.sh\".\nI tried to add the file ~/.local/share/applications/robomongo.desktop\nLike this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=robo-mongo\nComment=robomongo\nExec=/opt/robo/robomongo.sh\nTerminal=flase\nCategories=Application;\n\nAnd it's still not working from the dash.

However, they had not been correctly converted to the \"corresponding\" Heading 1, Heading 2, etc that Libreoffice uses (Thanks @gertvdijk). Thus, followin the steps in the accepted answer gets the job done.\nThanks!\n\nA: If you follow the answer of @don.joey, you will make the WHOLE YOUR DOCUMENT A NUMBERED LIST! Better avoid it! There are more natural native ways to number the headings. The Tools -> Chapter (Outline) Numbering is a much better way to go!\nIf you encounter some unexplainable problems sometimes you might need to reset the problematic heading style (change it to Default and back to Heading).\n\nA: Just \n\n\n*Hit F11 which opens the styles and apply the styles to heading 1 to 3. \n\n*Put your cursor in one of the headings and hit Format/Bullets and Numbering... (update: and not Tools/Outline Numbering... as mentioned before) in the menu bar. \n\n*Then select the tab outline and choose the option numeric with all sublevels (see image)\n\n\n\nIn the position tab of 'Bullets and Numbering' you can choose... their position of course.

There's no \"better\" editor, but I prefer nano. If you've already used visudo and chose an editor before, but you want to use another editor for the time being, you can do sudo EDITOR=vi visudo to use vi, or change it to nano to use nano. If you want to permanently change your preferred editor, do sudo update-alternatives --config editor.\n\nLook for this line:\nDefaults    env_reset\n\nAnd add timestamp_timeout=X (with a comma) at the end of it, where X is the time you want to set in minutes.\nSo your line should look like this, as an example:\nDefaults    env_reset,timestamp_timeout=5\n\nIf you specify 0, you will always be asked the password. If you specify a negative value, the timeout will never expire.\nOnce done, save and exit.\nSource: RootSudoTimeout\n\nA: Not sure if this expires or not, but you could try\nsudo su\n\nIt will ask you for the password and after that all commands are run as sudo.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Update Manager fails to install upates (Version 12.04 LTS) I have known about Ubuntu for quite a while but only a couple of months ago I started using it more often as my secondary OS.\nAnyway, my problem is that the update manager keeps failing to install the 16 updates I have and I'm not sure why so I need some help from more experienced users.

This will lead to doubts as to whether or not the new problems are the 32 bit incarnations of the old ones or new problems incurred due to the switch or even brand new ones associated with just running a 32 bit setup for that situation.\nMy advice when troubleshooting, is to eliminate as many unknowns and unusuals as possible, by having as standard a system as possible.  That way you can have a standard base to help identify what differences to everyone else's systems that are causing your problems.\n", "Q: No \"ENABLE BROADBAND\" option in network settings of ubuntu 12.10 i used to use 12.04 LTS and had the same problem..upgraded to 12.10 as i have read somewhere that 12.10 has a fix for it...but i still face the same problem..\n*i have wvdial...usb-mode switch packages\n*my modem also shows up in lsusb command\n*i have added my modem under the mobile broadband tab of network settings\n*enabled networking in recovery mode\nNOTE:-when i boot up in the recovery mode..the option is available in the network settings to \"ENABLE BROADBAND\" and also my modem shows up and i am able to connect it...but i am unable to do so in the normal boot.\np.s:- i use tata photon +\n\nA: You may try this:\nPress ALT+F2 and enter gksu gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/yourtataphoton.rules to create the file we need.

I know SMPlayer can select audio outputs, so it might be worth checking out that app to see if you can get anything at all from your HDMI audio. \nOn SMPlayer, start up a video, then on the menu select Tools -> Preferences. On the Audio tab go for the Output Driver and change it from Pulse to one of the alsa (0.x - HDA NVidia HDMI) options. See what works.\nInstalling pavucontrol will also give you much better control over your individual audio outputs. HDMI output may be muted by default.\n\nA: OK... Let's try something different. Open a terminal for me and let me know if the following command makes a noise through your HDMI setup.\naplay -D hw:0,3 testsound.wav\n\nNEW INSTRUCTIONS\nOpen a terminal and copy the command below\nsudo gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nEnter your password, and the configuration file for pulseaudio should open.\nLook for: \nload-module module-udev-detect use_ucm=0\n\nand add a # to the start so it reads:\n# load-module module-udev-detect use_ucm=0\n\nNow go to the end of the file and add on a new line:\nload-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,3\n\nSave the file and reboot. This should restart your system with the HDMI audio.\n\nA: Sometimes the HDMI audio is muted by default. Go into alsamixer and see if the HDMI channel is muted. Also your output of aplay -l shows only the integrated Intel Display and Audio driver, not the Nvidia one. from the aplay output card 0 is the Intel card, card 1 may be your Nvidia card. You can add the -c # parameter to specify the card # to work with.\ntry this in a console:\nsudo alsamixer -c 1\nSelect the HDMI output and un-mute it if it is muted. It may just be that easy. If you don't see any devices remove the -c 1 and try again. If your HDMI audio out was already un-muted then there is a LOT of information out there on audio not playing over HDMI and it is quite a deep rabbit hole to go down.\nYou can also try this sound troubleshooting Procedure: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure\n\nA: In my case I had to go to Sounds Settings at the top right of the desktop, and select output: HDMI.

You may need to use one of the proprietary drivers to make sound work correctly.  \nTest - If you are having issues, make sure the HDMI device is selected in \"Sound Settings\" and click \"Test Sound\".  If you don't get sound from the \"Front Left\" and \"Front Right\" test buttons try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Software & Updates > Proprietary Drivers and select the NVidia Legacy Driver (older cards) or the NVidia binary driver and click \"Apply Changes.\"\n\n*Once the driver installation completes return to the \"Sound Settings\" again and repeat this test.  If it still doesn't work you can try a different driver.\nI have to do this on my media center machine every time I reinstall Ubuntu.\n", "Q: In 13.04 using Unity Tweak Tool hot corners stops working after reboot I have 13.04 64 bit Ubuntu installed and I'm using Unity Tweak tool to enable hot corners everything works as it should as long as I don't reboot as soon as I do hotcorners stops working.

I guess its because that is the only corner on the screen Ubuntu does not get to use with default launchers.\n\nA: in 14.04 for a work around what I did was write a bash script to set the hot corner edge valuse using dconf, but you will need to use dconf to find out what hot corner triggers you are using\nyou need to install dconf-editor, using the tree-structure you can work out the paths.\n#!/bin/bash\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/scale/initiate-edge \"'|TopLeft'\"\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/scale/initiate-all-edge \"'|BottomLeft'\"\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/expo/expo-edge \"'TopRight'\"\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/show-desktop-edge \"'|BottomRight'\"\n\nFor expo it didn't have | in front\nThen I ran this automatically script after logging in.\n\nA: I've had mixed luck with this, which used to fix this reliably in 12.04: Scale plugin keeps forgetting hot corner settings on restart : \n\nRun gconf-editor from Terminal or Alt+F2\n  Navigate to apps > compiz-1 > general > screen0 > options\n  Edit the key: active_plugins\n  Move \"Scale\" to the bottom of the list.\n  Move \"Expo\" to bottom right above \"Scale\" and underneath Unityshell. \n\nTry moving Expo to after Scale at the absolute bottom in 12.10+\n", "Q: Ubuntu/Qt Application In Qt Creator:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the 'Qt GUI Application' completely different from 'Ubuntu touch GUI Application'?\n\n*Does Ubuntu App Developer community accept 'Qt GUI Application' developed on Ubuntu platform?\n\n\nA: The Ubuntu Touch Simple UI aplication template helps you create the basics of an application that uses the Ubuntu SDK and has the native look and feel of Ubuntu and can integrate with the rest of the platform. It is the recommended way to start writing your first apps in Ubuntu, and you'll be using the QML programming language.\nThe Qt GUI application, will create a basic app using Qt only, but it will not use the Ubuntu SDK (unless you manually add it later). The app will be based on the Qt foundations and C++. It's not the recommended way to get started, but the app you create will run fine in Ubuntu, although it might not have the native look and feel of other Ubuntu apps.\nAnd yes, while we recommend and encourage using the Ubuntu SDK, our community will welcome almost any kind of app and contributions you make to Ubuntu! :)\n", "Q: Using Ext4 partitions on external storage If I want to use a USB flash memory or an external hard disk to transfer data and at the same time I want to use ext4 partitions on them. How could I do that without getting problems regarding permissions and ownership? How could I use it as I would if I were using NTFS partitions; without having to change permissions or ownership every time I plug it in a computer?\nNote:\nI understand that I won't be able to access these partitions from Windows, but I want to be able to access them from any Linux machine without having to change permission or ownership. I know that I won't face any problems if the other machines's user ID is the same as mine; but for instance, Fedora's first user has the ID 500 and Ubuntu's first user has the ID of 1000, which means that if I was transferring data from an Ubuntu machine to a Fedora machine, I'll either have to change permissions or I'll have to change ownership.

I installed kubuntu (unity is a hassle on my desktop, can't handle it), and rebooted.  It booted straight into terminal (or whatever it's called, not a GUI).

I am trying to connect to my MySQL DB through SSH, but I don't see that option when I try to make a new connection. Any suggestions? Thanks!\n( I did try some researching but I could not find helpful results )\n\nA: You can create an SSH tunnel manually with:\nssh -L 33060:localhost:3306 user@remotehost\n\nWhile this ssh session is open, connections to your port 33060 will be forwarded to (the standard mysql server) port 3306 on the remote server.\nThen any mysql client can connect to the mysql server running on 'remotehost', e.g.:\nmysql -P 33060 -h 127.0.0.1 -u mysqluser -p\n\nI've used this method to connect emma to a mysql server running privately (not accessible externally) on another machine before. Unfortunately, with this method, you have to establish the tunnel manually before emma's stored server connection will work.\n\nA: A much more reliable way to create an ssh tunnel to a remote mysql database is to use gstm, the Gnome SSH Tunnel Manager...\nsudo apt-get install gstm\n\nThen run the gui application, create a named config for your connection, with host set to destination host and port set to 22 (probably) as the ssh port. Tick autostart if you want this tunnel to auto-launch on start up. Then add a port redirect, type local, port 33060, host same as destination, to port 3306.\nOne thing to note is that in clients, php config etc, you will probably want to use 127.0.0.1:33060 rather than localhost:3306 because reasons. (Something to do with sockets).\n", "Q: Can't Mount SSHFS via FSTAB, but can mount via CLI. How do I get FSTAB to mount properly? I have setup password less SSH access and it works properly.

I also needed to add the _netdev paramater to the end of my FSTAB entry.\nI found the following here \nIf the automatic mounting procedure following a reboot is not successful, it may be because the drive is not yet ready when executing “fstab”.  To remedy this, please just enter the following lines in the file “/etc/rc.local” in front of the line “exit 0”:\n\nsleep 20\nmount -a\n\nYou can progressively reduce the value 20 until it is just sufficient to mount your Drive successfully after a reboot.\n\n", "Q: Error: need a repository as argument? how to fix this problem?!

I decided to uninstall Windows 7 with OS-Uninstaller. I didn't remember that my Ubuntu was installed with Wubi and when I uninstalled Windows 7, I also lost Wubi. Now I can't boot my laptop. I also thought I could install Ubuntu on an USB, but my laptop is unable to boot from USB. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Create a bootable Ubuntu disc and install using that http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop. It will work pretty much the same way as installing from a live USB.\n\nA: When you turn your computer on there should be a short window of opportunity to access the BIOS menu. This is where you can change the boot priority of your computer. Usually the CD drive is the highest priority which is why an install disk is booted when it's in the tray on startup. The USB drive is often listed as a lower priority than the main hard drive which is why you probably can't boot from USB.\nThat said, I'd recommend installing from a CD/DVD. It is a lot more reliable and there is a lot less quirkiness involved.\n", "Q: how to find out what versions of a package from a launchpad repository are available with apt-get If I go to the following web page\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gedit/+publishinghistory\nthere are a number of versions of gedit listed for the distribution \"raring\" (3.6.0-0ubuntu1, 3.6.1-0ubuntu2, 3.6.1-0ubuntu3, and 3.6.2-0ubuntu1), however, when i issue the command \"apt-cache -f showpkg gedit\", the only version it lists is \"3.6.2-0ubuntu1\". The \"Synaptic Package Manager\" GUI also only lists this version. How do I know what versions are available for download using the syntax explained in the question \nHow to install specific Ubuntu packages, with exact version?\nby looking at the launchpad.net web page listed above?\nMy ultimate goal is to learn how to specify a specifc version of a package to install from an older release than what I have installed, but I can't even figure out how to install a different package version on the release I am already running.\nNote, I am just using gedit as an example here because it is a package that I found to have multiple versions listed on launchpad.net for the release \"raring\". The package I really want to install is https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-disk-utility/3.0.2-2ubuntu8/+build/3485589, but it is also of a different release, so I decided to try the simpler gedit case which is of the same release. The latest gnome-disk-utility package has a very dumbed down user interface and many features removed (although some new features have been added). I can manually install the old gnome-disk-utility version by downloading .deb files and installing them by double clicking, but I want to be able to do everything using apt-get.\n\nA: To get all versions available to install with apt-get, you can use the command:\napt-cache madison <package>\n\nExample:\n$ apt-cache madison mercurial\nmercurial | 2.8.2-1ppa2~precise1 | http://ppa.launchpad.net/tortoisehg-ppa/releases/ubuntu/ precise/main i386 Packages\nmercurial | 2.0.2-1ubuntu1 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/universe i386 Packages\nmercurial | 2.8.2-1ppa2~precise1 | http://ppa.launchpad.net/tortoisehg-ppa/releases/ubuntu/ precise/main Sources\n\nAs you see, there's version 2.0.2 from official ubuntu archive, and version 2.8.2 from mercurial PPA.\nYou can install exact version like that:\n$ sudo apt-get install mercurial=2.0.2-1ubuntu1\n\n", "Q: Framebuffer Imageviewer on Ubuntu 12.04.2 virtual machine I'm trying to view some jpg's on my Ubuntu VMWare server using fbi but I'm getting \"/dev/fb0: No such file or directory\", which is valid since it doesn't exist.

Look in your home directory using ls -al. There should be a file called .Xauthority (its a hidden file). If this file is owned by root this could be causing your problem. You can fix it by using sudo chown <username>:<username> .Xauthority to regain ownership of the file or you can rename it mv .Xauthority .old.Xauthority and a new file with correct ownership will be created when you login. When I had this problem this worked for me, hopefully it works for you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot after deleting a partition I have a laptop that I run 2 OSs on, Ubuntu and Chromium. They are on separate hard drives, and I physically swap the drives when I want to change the OS. \nRecently I wanted to install Windows 7 instead of Chromium, so I went ahead and began installing Windows. I got to the screen where you select the disk/partition to install to, and I started deleting the old partitions. That's when I realized that I had forgotten to switch the drives, and I was deleting Ubuntu partitions. I only deleted one, it was the smaller partition (~200MB). I think this was the boot partition because now Ubuntu won't boot. How can I get this partition back?\n\nA: Your best bet is probably to use TestDisk, which comes on most Linux emergency discs and live CDs.\nGiven the size of the partition, I suspect this may have been an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT partition that holds EFI boot loaders. If I'm right, you'll need to give it an appropriate type code after you restore it. You can do this with gdisk, sgdisk, or cgdisk by setting the type code to EF00; or with parted or GParted by setting the \"boot flag\" on the partition.

So far, event after reboots, I haven't noticed any difference, it still never asks for any passwords.\nIt's not a biggie but I guess I've just used to how my local Ubuntu works.\n\nA: EC2 does not have an easy way to provide you with a secure password for the ubuntu user, so the default is to allow passwordless sudo after you connect securely with the ssh private key.\nIf you add a password to the ubuntu user, you can require it for sudo by editing /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users and changing:\nubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nto:\nubuntu ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nThis command does that edit for you (assuming an untouched, default sudoers file):\nsudo perl -pi -e 's%NOPASSWD:%%' /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users\n\nFor safety, keep a separate shell logged in as root so that you can fix the file and recover if you edit it incorrectly and break sudo.\nAdding a password for sudo increases the overall security of your system.\nIt is still recommended that you not allow the use of a password for ssh logins.  Keep that limited to ssh private keys.\n", "Q: xfce icons instead of tabs For my taskbar programs are displayed like:\n(symbol of chromium)askubuntu.com\nI would like it as:\n\n\nsymbol of chromium [no titles]\naskubuntu.com\nimagemagick man page\n\n\nLike in cinnamon or windows 7.

What is going on here?  What is ldconfig, and what does it do?\n\nA: ldconfig creates the necessary links and cache to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories specified on the command line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories (/lib and /usr/lib). The cache is used by the run-time linker, ld.so or ld-linux.so. ldconfig checks the header and filenames of the libraries it encounters when determining which versions should have their links updated.\nldconfig will attempt to deduce the type of ELF libs (i.e., libc5 or libc6/glibc) based on what C libs, if any, the library was linked against.\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/8/ldconfig\n", "Q: How do I open a new terminal window to ssh into a new computer and execute commands?

You can ssh to a host, start screen and from there open multiple virtual consoles, one for each command you want to run.\nWhat's really nice about screen, is that if you loose the ssh connection, you can create a new one and reattach to the running screen sessions.

I want to recover them and I know the filename, but as they are all alike inside I can't use foremost or scalpel. The testdisk recovers the files but without the original filename so it's useless. Any help?\n\nA: testdisk has multiple modes of operation, and I think in simple mode it just does a sector-by-sector scan of the disk looking for things that look like files.\nYou'll want to follow to the letter this guide, which details going into advanced mode and then selecting the desired partition.\nThe ability to recover the filename from a deleted file depends on the filesystem used.  \nIn FAT filesystems (including, I believe, FAT32) when a file is deleted the first character of its filename is overwritten and thus can't be recovered, but the rest of the filename can.  When testdisk recovers a deleted file on a FAT filesystem, it substitutes the missing first letter with an underscore.  So after recovery with testdisk (assuming you chose the right mode), instead of looking for \"myfile.txt\" you'll want to look for \"_yfile.txt\".  I'm not sure what testdisk does for multiple files that have identical names from the second letter onwards.\nNote that testdisk is designed for use on an entire partition or drive at once and it's designed to be able to recover from a partition you can no longer mount, so when it recovers files it doesn't recover them in-place, it must recover them to a separate drive.\n", "Q: Install clang 3.3 on Ubuntu 12.04 and see unmet dependencies errors ubuntu@ubuntu-VirtualBox:~/Downloads$ sudo apt-get install clang-3.3 clang-3.3-doc libclang-common-dev libclang-dev libclang1 libclang1-dbg libllvm-3.3-ocaml-dev libllvm3.3 libllvm3.3-dbg lldb-3.3 llvm-3.3 llvm-3.3-dev llvm-3.3-doc llvm-3.3-examples llvm-3.3-runtime\nReading package lists...

Second, I'll assume that the server has sshd running to facilitate remote access, and that you can log in as a user called user with access to the log files.\nTo do this, I would run an scp command on the desktop system:\nscp -r user@server:/path/to/get/log/files /path/to/put/log/files\n\n", "Q: Batch download file from internet?

Im trying to figure out on how to run an iso rather than mounting it but I have tried checking other sources but I either don't get what it means or it's the opposite. Help on this would be awesome.\n\nA: \"run an ISO rather than mounting\" -- there is no such thing.

At least with mac os I have all that.\nI am really trying to get UBUNTU on the Power PC. I like how it works on my other devises. At the very end I just want to dual boot it or run it off a usb.\nPowerPC 7447/7457altivec supported \nPlease help me get my old mac some functionality back. It was a great machine. \ntried ubuntu-12.04-desktop-powerpc.iso  it installed LUBUNTU well its the desktop environment\ntried 13.04  no luck. \nWell I just checked bios and its running Saucy Salamander. \nthank you\n\nA: You probably have sorted this by now, but Lubuntu is less painful because it it does not seem to rely on radeon.\nI am assuming you have ATI Radeon not NVidia GPU.\nOnce Lubuntu is installed, you can install gnome and unity but it is not quite perfect - for example login screen remains in a Lubuntu configuration.\nI have used several, latest being 13.04.\nOn booting live CD you will need to use \nlive video=radeonfb:1024x768-32@60\n\nYou can try other resolutions, depths and refresh rates to suit your machine.\nFor 17\" PowerBook G4 it should be \nlive video=radeonfb:1440x900-24@60 or \nlive video=radeonfb:1440x900-32@60\n\n\nA: Ok, so here is the answer. I'm not kidding it took a while and it was not pain free. But my basic steps were. Find an 10.4 Ubuntu ppc disk. I booted from that. What was not working was the wireless so I had to Ethernet from my computer. Right away Ubuntu wipes the disk and begins loading. \nWhat is weird is I think I downloaded the server disk by mistake. It took forever to load, but I did have to use the live command to get it to boot. And the actual command was not Radeon 1024x 768@60 but instead change the refresh to @75.   \nNext I had to figure out how to change this from a server to a single computer reboot. I stuck in the 10.10 disk and looked up a command to install unity. It does this rather quickly, but it is live and the connection get stuck. Just unplug the ethernet connection if the disk is spinning and it will find libraries from the cd. \nThe next step is finding the 12.04 disk. That also provides the driver to get the internet working. Now if your like me you have an extra usb modem hanging around which works great but it take about 100 trials to get the hardware to recognize the airport card. Eventually it all works out. \nThen there you are, wireless, desktop can find apps, and then maybe if your lucky your sound comes works right away. But aha. Flash is not working with Firefox and you can kiss watching pretty much any video goodbye. \nUntil you search and find flash.com which gives you linux drivers you install and voila, you finally have a working computer. It all works although you then wonder what the heck good is this? Simultaneously, you find web browsers that promise to work with tiger and leopard. So is Ubuntu a great install on PPC? IM not sure. It does seem to crash a bit, as the machine is ten years old. But then everything is up to date. And I do get to play Galaga on it, where I never could with the Mac OS (stupid emulators!)\nAnyways. I am thinking Dual boot or just get rid of Ubuntu as maybe a web browser would give this old box more functionality and the drive would spin all the time. It is probably a little memory slow for even Ubuntu (as it screamed with Lubuntu on it), But it also shows that Ubuntu has a great place on a more modern mac, which I have triple booted and typing this for you. Gosh I'd rather use Ubuntu than the new stupid windows, which locks you into single screen applications at a time and then limits your functionality . But Ubuntu on this iMac is screaming fast and a pleasure to work with. Heck its even fast on my Intel 6 year old pc, which it also brought new life too. \nSo my next post will be suggestions how to add back tiger to be able to dual boot the powerpc, Otherwise, its just a novelty and I would get rid of it on that older machine. \nOver all I am loving Ubuntu, thanks to all you developers!\n", "Q: Unity Launcher missing and Terminal shortcut stopped working When I restarted my Ubuntu after it being updated, I found the Unity launch bar was gone.\nI tried looking up several solutions online, blindly typing in the commands that others suggested, and I found after the umpteenth time rebooting after typing in another foreign command, I found I couldn't even open up the terminal with the Ctrl+Alt+t shortcut either and I have no idea how to fix this.\nThis was the last set of instructions I remember following before terminal stopped opening. \nInstall CCSM\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nAnd then run it in terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t)\nccsm\nThen search for \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\".

Open up a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type\ngksudo nautilus\n\nAlternatively, you can type in the following lines in the terminal window\nsudo su\nnautilus\n\nEnter your password when it asks for it. \nThis allow you to run Nautilus with root privileges. So you can now freely edit your files using the GUI instead of the terminal. I still don't see the need for it and I cannot emphasize enough on the potential risks involved. Don't blame me if you break your system using this method. You have been warned!\n\nA: It's generally not a good idea to make your user have root privileges.  If you need to perform some action that requires root privileges, you can request those privileges just for that particular command with sudo on the console, or kdesudo or gksudo if you're using KDE or Gnome/Unity, respectively.\n\nA: Becoming a user having full Root privileges is not considered a good way of working with Ubuntu (or even Linux in general).\nThere are a lot of important things that can be messed up if you operate as a root user.\nYou could mess up with your Core OS files. Everything that needs to be done as a root user can be done by using the sudo command.\n\nAlso a small tip: Use symlinks to link files in the www folder with the files in your home folder to avoid managing file permissions.\n\n\nA: I have solved the problem by editing the permission on the folder by (chmod g+w www)&(chmod o+w www)... Thanks\nDo you think this is an appropriate method ? or copying the 'php' files to the \"www\" directory from 'sudo' terminal is better ?\nI got help from HERE\n", "Q: Stuck at logo screen while booting I have Ubuntu installed on a Gateway NV53A laptop with Windows 7 removed, and recently when I've tried to start the computer, it gets stuck at the logo screen that says \"Ubuntu\" with the progress bar lights.\nI recently upgraded to 13.04.\nI'm able to start by going to advanced options in the GRUB menu and then selecting recovery mode and then hitting F, but I have to do this each time I start.

I'm setting up a VPS that'll host a couple of sites, and I'd like to back up everything to another host which has a nice massive ZFS, allowing me to snapshot frequently.\nWith the knowledge I have ATM, I only see rsync as a solution since it does delta backups with the -c flag, pretty necessary since this VPS has a limited bandwidth and potentially a quite large dataset, so transmitting everything one or several times a day isn't feasible.\nOn the other hand, that means that if I need to properly preserve permissions and back up everything, including stuff that's only readable by root (such as SSL certificates), I need to enable authkey SSH root logins on either one of the hosts (and push or pull backups accordingly). And I'd really like to avoid that.\nOr do I need to do that? Is there some trick that you know of that would allow me to run some cronjob on the VPS and push out differential backup data to my other host without having to compromise security yet still be able to back up all files and preserve their permissions and ownerships?\nI guess a last resort could be to set up a VM on the ZFS host only for this purpose, enable password-less ssh root logins on a non-standard port inside it, make sure its disk image is on ZFS (or is a ZVOL) and then push the backup files to it. But damn, that seems clunky, it would be a hassle to set up, and it'd eat resources on that host.\nIdeas?\nThanks :)\n\nA: Have you considered using tar to do the incremental deltas, and rsyncing the resulting tarballs with normal user permissions? sudo tar locally would preserve the ownership and permissions within the tarball, but neither machine would need to grant elevated permissions for the other. \nIt would eat more disk space, but that might be a cost you can afford in this case. \n", "Q: Ubuntu - Internet isnt working nor popping up I am COMPLETELY new to Ubuntu, like literally, I only know a few commands and stuff for terminal..

We have run the same test on the same machine with Windows 7, Windows 2008 server and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64bit), and Ubuntu performed the worst. I was very surprised as I was rooting for Ubuntu (Luckily I did not enter into any bets!).\nLooking forward to some insightful answers.\nPieter Breedt\nStellenbosch, South Africa\n\nA: I can give you an answer to \"Why is it slower?\". The Matlab website makes the following points:\n\nMATLAB performance is similar on Windows®, Mac OS® X, and Linux®, although differences can occur among platforms for the following reasons:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MathWorks builds its products with a different compiler on each platform, and each has its own performance characteristics.\n  \n*MathWorks incorporates third-party libraries into its products that may perform differently on each platform.\n  \n*The operating systems perform differently, especially in the case of disk- or graphics-intensive operations.\n  \n\nYou can attempt to negate the last point by running comparable benchmarks for CPU and disk IO but unless you find a huge flaw (eg you're accidentally using an awful partition format or your system is only showing half a CPU or you have CUDA enabled in Windows but not in Linux) the other two points are not something you can solve.\nWhat you're most likely seeing at the moment is a cruel reality: developers put more time into optimising their Windows builds because that's where most of their market is.\nI would definitely suggest you talk directly to Mathworks. They're almost certainly aware of how Matlab should perform on stock systems so if you're deviating away from their figures, there may be something wrong that they can help you identify.\nAnd even if you are seeing what they expect, by bringing this up with them they might be more inclined to fix the underlying problem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04, Mounting 2nd HDD, lost home directory I hope someone can help.\nI installed a 2nd HDD, set up 2 partitions on it.\nI set up both partitions to mount automatically in /etc/ftsab.\nOne of the partitions has a mount point of my home directory /home/nick\nTrouble is, I forgot to copy everything from the original /home/nick before testing my /etc/fstab by rebooting.

At the same time it does not even upload/download the files it is supposed to. The progress is stuck at the same point and the dropbox daemon has not uploaded/downloaded more than one file in the last 24 hours. We are only talking about small files like pictures (~ 4-10 MB each). The effect this has on my laptop is that it overheats, sometimes with core temperatures up to 15-20 degrees above normal. The CPU utilization and temperature fall noticeably after I kill the dropbox daemon. \nI have had this problem for more than a week now. I am using Xubuntu 12.04. I have more than enough local disk space available (8 GB in the disk where home and root are mounted) and 20 GB free space in my Dropbox account. I have 2 GB RAM. \nI have also tried the following process (mentioned in this question: Dropbox is taking too much CPU time. How can I fix it?):\nsudo apt-get purge nautilus-dropbox\nrm -r $HOME/.dropbox*\nsudo apt-get install nautlius-dropbox\n\nBut it made no difference to the problem at hand.\n\nA: First run in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install cpulimit && sudo apt-get update\n\nThen use a text editor like gedit or kate and put the following text in the file.\n#!/bin/sh\ndropbox start -i\ncpulimit -e dropbox -l 15\n\nsave the file with a name like \"cpulimit.sh.\" After saving go to the icon and right click, somewhere in the permissions section, there will be a box for \"make executable\" or something similar. Check that box. Go to the autostart program, which you can find by typing \"startup\" in unity ubuntu or autostart in kubuntu. Add a program, browse, find the .sh file you made and set ok. It should run every time you boot up. In the code above you'll notice there is a '15' that is the cpu useage max. You could probably set it even lower if you want (eg replace '15' with '8' or whatever). I don't know if there is a minimum or not.\n\nA: My situation might be different from yours, but I was having the exact same problem, however I'm now at a point where my Dropbox is working correctly.\nTwo things may have been a factor in getting my Dropbox into a working state.\nFirst, specifics of the reinstall.

To install Smartgit you can run it once by doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd smartgithg-4_5_5/bin\n\n*sudo ./add-menuitem.sh\nAfter that you can find Smartgit in the unity list of programs (just type Super and write \"Smartgit\"), and you can add it on the launcher.\nThis type of installation has also the advantage that Smartgit downloads and install the last version automatically when an update comes out, so you don't need to uninstall and re-install the new version anymore.\nIf you want to remove Smartgit run the commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd smartgithg-4_5_5/bin\n\n*sudo ./remove-menuitem.sh\nand remove the folder smartgithg-4_5_5.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: As my blog post here suggests\n\n*\n\n*Open file explorer Files.\n\n\n*Press Alt+F10 and select Preferences.\n\n\n*It would show something like this.\n\n\n\n*In the Behavior tab, select Run executable text files when they are opened and close it.\n", "Q: How to install postgresql-8.4? sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pitti/postgresql\n# ...

Currently Windows 7 really consumes a lot of CPU and RAM. If we're going to look at it who consumes less CPU and RAM, is it Windows 7 or Ubuntu 12.04? \nAdditional Info.\n\n\n*\n\n*Both OS are running on the same hardware Specifications\n\n*AMD A6 APU Dual Core with 2.7GHZ\n\n*8 GB of ram\n\n\nA: Windows 7 requires a minimum of 1000 Mhz processor with 1GB of RAM, while Ubuntu requires a minimum of 700 Mhz processor with 384MB RAM. While these are the official requirements, in practice, the requirements are considerably higher. From my experience, If you install both the operating systems on identical hardware, Ubuntu’s performance is significantly higher than that of Windows 7.\nIn fact, if you were to pull out a 7 year old computer from a junkyard, Ubuntu will work flawlessly.\nMoreover, the boot time of Ubuntu is considerably less than its Windows 7 counterpart.\n\nA: I'm answering this from real life experience, I had Windows 7 installed for a long time, on Core 2 Duo 2.4Ghz, with 8 GB RAM, and it had an OK performance.  I installed Ubuntu 11.04 at the time, in a virtual machine, and that did a major performance drop.  Now since I made Ubuntu my main OS, and I'm still running 12.04LTS, same hardware, with 4 virtual machine, one of which is Windows 7, and its like a dream.  Same performance as with just a fresh installation of Ubuntu.  Oh, all 4 VM run at the same time.  So to end this, Ubuntu will perform much better than windows. (personal opinion).\n\nA: My experience:\nI used to have Windows 7 in a virtual machine with 1GB RAM. It was used mainly for firefox and few other applications. It worked ok, never had any performance problems.\nNow I installed Ubuntu 14 LTS. It doesn't function with 1GB RAM at all. Open firefox, open youtube, open google maps, it comes to a still. Needs 2GB at least. On a bright side, I don't need to use mouse anymore. Just need to learn all those command line switches. Reminds me of my VAX/VMS youth. What shelf is that \"ls\" manual on?\n", "Q: How to outline fonts in a PDF (or eps) file? Say, I have a PDF graphic (such a plot made with matplotlib, Mathematica or similar), which contains vector art and text. The text uses non-standard or proprietary fonts  (such Computer Modern if inline-TeX is used). The fonts are (usually) embedded and the PDF renders nicely in evince/acroread.\nI'd like to edit/share the pdf without relying on those fonts, e.g. in Inkscape. Is there tool that will convert all text to paths?\n\n\n*\n\n*Inkscape is not suitable here because it will replace the non-standard font with \"Sans\".\n\n*pdf2svg has issues with line art.\n\n\nA: You can use Inkscape for this.\nFile -> Open -> open your PDF.\nA dialog \"PDF Import Settings\" will pop up. If you tick the checkbox \"Import via Poppler\", the text will be converted to symbols on importing.\nIf needed, you can convert symbols further to paths and edit them (but as far as the specific question here goes, namely editing/sharing the pdf without relying on the fonts, symbols work fine).\n", "Q: sudo apt-get update leads to crash of terminal application I try to run sudo apt-get update and the terminal freezes and a message pops up: Ubuntu experienced an internal error...\nI am trying to work with OpenFOAM and all the times is asking me to update things and when I try it, it gets stuck. \n Ubuntu version is 12.04.\n\nA: Try this:\nMake a back up copy of your sources.list:\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list{,.backup}\n\nNow remove the original and update:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: How to discover the IP addresses within a network with a bash script? Is it possible to determine the IP addresses of systems within a network using a bash script? And how?\n\nA: Install arp-scan (sudo apt-get install arp-scan) and add the following line to the script:\nIPs=$(sudo arp-scan --localnet --numeric --quiet --ignoredups | grep -E '([a-f0-9]{2}:){5}[a-f0-9]{2}' | awk '{print $1}')\n\nNow you have all the active IP addresses in the IPs variable.\nNote: this will only work on a directly connected network, i.e. not accessed through a router.\nPS: If you install gawk the command can be shortened to (thanks belacqua):\nIPs=$(sudo arp-scan --localnet --quiet --ignoredups | gawk '/([a-f0-9]{2}:){5}[a-f0-9]{2}/ {print $1}')\n\n\nA: This answer uses the nmap command to gather information of active hosts in the network.\n\nNmap (\"Network Mapper\") is an open source tool for network exploration\n  and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,\n  although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets\n  in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network,\n  what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering,\n  what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type\n  of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other\n  characteristics.\n\nAssuming you need to scan the 192.168.0.X range, you can try:\nnmap -v -sP 192.168.0.0/24\n\nWhere 192.168.0.0 is the network address and /24 is the network mask equivalent to 255.255.255.0. Thus the above command will scan 256 hosts.\nTo collect the active IP addresses, one can use the following line:\nIPS_UP=$(nmap -nsP 192.168.0.0/24 2>/dev/null -oG - | grep \"Up$\" | awk '{printf \"%s \", $2}')\n\nIt actually concatenates the list of active IP addresses (filtered by grep) into a variable called IPS_UP:\n\n\n*\n\n*nmap is run with switches -n (no name resolution), -sP (ping scan) and -oG to output a grep processable output onto the standard output (-).\n\n*grep filters only lines containing the word \"Up\" at the end of line (\"$\").\n\n*awk prints the second column in the list output by nmap, which is the IP address, and appends a space.\n\n*The $() command substitution allows the output of the chain of commands to be assigned to the IPS_UP variable.\n\n\nThe Network Mapper can be installed by using sudo apt-get install nmap.\nNote\nnmap might discover more hosts if run by a privileged user. This is because different kind of packets are sent to scan a host. By modifying the above line to read sudo nmap ... allows to run the nmap command as root.\n\nA: Obviously this is a bad idea, but I gave it a try\n#!/bin/bash\n\nIP=$(ifconfig eth0 | grep Mask | cut -d ':' -f2 | cut -d \" \" -f1)\nMask=$(ifconfig eth0 | grep Mask | cut -d ':' -f4 | cut -d \" \" -f1)\nIFS=.\nIPArray=($IP)\nMaskArray=($Mask)\nNetArray=()\nStart=0\nMax=$(( 255 * 255 * 255 * 255 ))\nfor key in \"${!IPArray[@]}\";\ndo\n   NetArray[$key]=$(( ${IPArray[$key]} & ${MaskArray[$key]} ))\n   Start=$(( $Start + (${NetArray[$key]} << (3-$key)*8) )) \ndone\nIFS=\necho \"Your IP Address   : $IP\"\necho \"Your N/W Mask     : $Mask\"\necho \"Your N/W Address  : ${NetArray[@]}\"\necho \"IPs to be Checked : $(( $Max - $Start ))\"\nfor ((IPs=$Start; IPs <= $Max; IPs++))\ndo \n   IP=$(( IPs >> 24 ))\n   IP=\"$IP.$(( (IPs >> 16) & 255 ))\"\n   IP=\"$IP.$(( (IPs >> 8) & 255 ))\"\n   IP=\"$IP.$(( IPs & 255 ))\"\n   $(ping -c 1 -w 1 $IP >& /dev/null)\n   if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then\n      echo \"$IP exists in Network.

It would be really amazing if there is any better option for this.   \n\nA: Unless you've got a really good reason to make something new (some people do), I'd look at existing applications that do what you're asking.\nGnome used to have a Typing Break feature but that was six years ago and that's a lot of time when developers are hell-bent on ripping out all the useful features. It might still be there. (Pre-post-edit: Yeah, looks like this was nuked in 2010/11. Sigh.)\nRSI is a long-standing issue so there are other applications that do what you want: \n\n\n*\n\n*Workrave is probably the best option. More configuration than Typing Break and it allows you to do exactly what you're asking (it'll blank out the screen and disable input). It's also in the repos.\n\n*drwright is a port of Typing Break for Gnome 3 stuff but it should work in Unity too. You'll need to add a PPA (on the page) to install it but that's not a huge issue.\n\n\nA: To add the  keyboard to it, you can use a very similar method to  what you already have.\nGo to a terminal and type xinput. This will show you the id numbers for all your input devices. In my case, my keyboard appears as \"AT Translated Set 2 keyboard\",   id=12; so in my case I would add the lines\nxinput set-int-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 8 0\nand\nxinput set-int-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 8 1\ninto the respective places in the script. Just substitute \"12\" for whatever ID your keyboard appears as in xinput. \nAs for running the script on startup; you will need a first line saying #!/bin/bash.\nAssuming it is called lockmeout.sh, copy it to your home directory (~) and then do chmod +x ~/lockmeout.sh. Then, open \"Startup applications\" (available by typing \"startup\" in the dash), and add an entry that points to that script. Now it should execute whenever you log in, and stay running in the background.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: What Licenses am I allowed to use when selling Ubuntu wallpapers?

What licenses are permitted for wallpapers to be sold?\n\nA: As I already point out in my comment, the documentation isn't currently going to help you.\nI would go in with the assumption that you can license a wallpaper under the same terms as most software (in that you can hold copyright, or a license to redistribute it and you can give people a license for it - this is all true in most civilised parts of the world) but you should confirm directly with Canonical that they'll accept a paid wallpaper package before you do anything.\nThat you're asking the question suggests that you might be thinking of a non-traditional license. Perhaps if you can expand on that, you might get a better answer... But if you're thinking of a \"standard\" commercial software license, I think you'll be fine.\n", "Q: Fatal error \"bad config file\" while installing Git for Ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to install Git for Ubuntu 12.04, but running the git commands is giving me the following error message:\nCloning into 'neha'...\nfatal: bad config file line 1 in /root/.gitconfig\n\nUsing the article How to Install Git on Ubuntu 12.04 as a reference and even after changing the gitconfig file, I still get the same error.

I have a fairly standard ADSL connection. Modem/router with several computers inside. I would like to formalise some DNS entries so that when inside the network some legal DNS entries like server.myrealdomain.com resolves to a local IP.\nSidebar: the point of this is that when inside the network, devices will pick up the internal IPs and when outside the network, they'll be routed through the legal IP address and port-forwarded to the correct computer. If you think I'm approaching the problem the wrong way, tell me!\nI know I can tell the router to point to my internal server for DNS, I'm just left with the choice: Which DNS server should I use? It has to support upstream DNS (configurable), be lightning fast (as all queries on the network will shoot through this) but be easy enough to add overrides to. What are my choices?\n\nA: pdnsd is a fairly simple server that can do this. Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable in /etc/default/pdnsd\n\n*Switch server_ip to eth0 (or other), and enable serve_aliases in /etc/pdnsd.conf\n\n*Point computers' DNS settings at this computer and win.\n\n\nThere is one thing causing me pain now and that's Netgear home routers being absolutely awful. Thanks to some crazy decision, you can't host your DNS server within your network.

As in, will it cause me grief if I install some programs using apt-get and others using synaptic?  \nI've been doing this for years without incident, but I'd appreciate some reassurance from someone more knowledgeable than myself.\n\nA: My understanding is Synaptic and Ubuntu Software Center use the same underlying commands as apt-get and dpkg to do the actual management and installation. One test is to install a program using one method (say apt-get) and verify that it shows up in Sofware Center and Synaptic database as installed. \nIn other words, Synaptic and Ubuntu Software Center are graphical front ends for the relevant command line tools.\nUsing any of these should be fine. \nSee this forum post for a similar discussion.\n\nA: Most of the graphical tools available on Ubuntu are just front ends for apt (muon, synaptic, aptitude, Ubuntu Software Center,... fall in this category). With those, you will never get problems. However, they cannot run at the same time, because they lock the local apt files - meaning that for example you have to close aptitude in order to run synaptic. \nHowever, it's not impossible to install a completely different package manager like rpm or portage. If more than one package manager is installed, you probably will run into problems if you don't take special precautions, because they don't know about files installed by each other and might overwrite or delete them. \n", "Q: What is the Dialog Box used by the Ubuntu Server Installer?

Unfortunately, Ubuntu does not set up local mail by default, which is why Cron tells you in the logs “No MTA installed, discarding output”.\nSetting up local mail could be one way to solve your problem. Instead of a output in a terminal, you'd get an email notification.\nIf you want your cron job to output to a terminal, you'll have to redirect its output to the terminal. The redirection part is easy —\n0 07-17 * * * /home/dat/scripts/cron.out >/dev/pts/42 2>&1\n\nbut the problem is figuring out which terminal to redirect to. There's no universal answer to that, it depends how you want to select the terminal among the ones you're logged into.\nFor typical uses, a GUI notification would be more appropriate. You can use notify-send. You'll need to set the DISPLAY environment variable.\n0 07-17 * * * DISPLAY=:0 notify-send \"$(/home/dat/scripts/cron.out)\"\n\n\nA: Cron sends output to a mailer. If you want to see output in a terminal then you can log to a file and use tail -f to view output in the terminal you want to see output \n\nLog to a file\n\n\n*\n\n*The simplest answer is to log directly to a file with a crontab entry like:\n\n\n0 07-17 * * * /home/dat/scripts/cron.out > /path/to/log.txt 2> /path/to/error.txt\nAlternatives ways to log:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your program is a scrip that can be written to, you could modify it to redirect output to a log file with. echo output > log.txt, or you can use a wrapper script described below.\n\n*If your program is a binary or otherwise un-writable, then you must write wrapper script to capture output to a file.\n\n\nExample program and wrapper script:\n$ cat program.sh wrapper.sh \n#!/bin/bash\n# sample program\necho \"arg 1=$1 arg2=$2 arg3=$3\"\necho \"sample error\" >&2 \n\n#!/bin/bash\n# sample wrapper\nexec ./program.sh \"$@\" >log.txt 2> error.txt\n\nExample run 1:\n$ ./wrapper.sh 1 2 3 ; cat error.txt  log.txt \nsample error\narg 1=1 arg2=2 arg3=3\n\nExample run 2:\n$ ./wrapper.sh \"A B C\" D E ; cat error.txt log.txt \nsample error\narg 1=A B C arg2=D arg3=E\n\nView output in terminal:\nNow that your logging both standard out and standard error to a file, in any terminal, you can run tail -f on one or both files  like tail -f log.txt or tail -f log.txt error.txt so that tail will watch or rather follow the the file(s) for amendments.  tail man-page\n$ tail -f log.txt  error.txt\n==> log.txt <==\narg 1=1 arg2=2 arg3=3\n\n==> error.txt <==\nsample error\n\nLogging files appended afterwards:\nIf either log.txt or error.txt are later appended from either your program or from another terminal like $ echo \"more output\" >> log.txt, output is seen on the terminal running $ tail -f log.txt error.txt\n==> log.txt <==\nmore output\n\nFurthermore, $ echo code red >> error.txt results in:\n==> error.txt <==\ncode red\n\n\nA: The dirty way could be to redirect the output of your program to the pts file of an already existing terminal.\nTo know the pts file just type tty command\n~$ tty\n/dev/pts/4\n\nthen your crontab would be:\n0 07-17 * * * /home/dat/scripts/cron.out > /dev/pts/4\n\nAnother way could be to launch the program as an argument of the terminal:\nxfce4-terminal --command=/home/dat/scripts/cron.out --display=:0.0 -H\n\nwhere display is the X display where you want to show the terminal, -H is to tell the terminal to stay open after the command is terminated.\nThis will create every time a new terminal.\ncrontab:\n0 07-17 * * * /usr/bin/xfce4-terminal --display=:0.0 -H --command=/home/dat/scripts/cron.out\n\nif the display is not present you will have an error logged by syslog.\n", "Q: What does this output in syslog mean?

Let's do a car analogy!\n\n\n*\n\n*You might tell a stranger you drive \"a car\".\n\n*You tell somebody you're meeting later you'll be in a \"Red Ford Pickup\" so they can recognise you in it.\n\n*When you call your mechanic, you explain it's a classic 1969 Ford F250 Pickup 360 V8 and you need a new exhaust for it.\n\n\nYou don't need to be atomically accurate all the time. If you run around telling everybody everything in the maximum detail, you'll just end up looking a bit like a weirdo-super-geek. The same applies to Linux advocacy. If you insist on telling everybody you meet you're running Ubuntu GNU/Linux with amd64 architecture, people are going to wonder why you're doing it.\nBut technically speaking, the GNU tools with Linux is its kernel together make up an operating system. Ubuntu as the distribution makes that all work and layers on useful tools like display servers, window managers and the applications.\nBut if you're just bragging about what you're running, Linux or Ubuntu will do. People will get the gist.\n\nA: You are more or less saying the same controversy as \"Linux\" and \"GNU/Linux\", but instead of \"GNU/Linux\" you are talking about \"Ubuntu\":\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy\n\nGNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF),\n  its founder Richard Stallman, and its supporters, for operating\n  systems that include GNU software and the Linux kernel. The FSF argues\n  for the term GNU/Linux because GNU was a longstanding project to\n  develop a free operating system, of which they say the kernel was the\n  last missing piece.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu is a collection of software, configurations and practices called a Distribution.\nLinux is the Kernel on top of which everything else runs and is the Operating System. \n\nA: You may find that there's some variety of opinion on this question. Personally, I tend to think of the \"operating system\" as the overall last-mile product that I install on my computer, which uses particular packages like GNU libc and the Linux kernel to satisfy specific functional requirements.\nConsider a thought experiment: If Ubuntu 14.04 included an automated, behind the scenes transition to a Hurd or Mach microkernel instead of Linux as soon as you upgraded to it, with all the other apps and libraries remaining the same (please ignore for the moment how problematic and unlikely this would be), would you consider your system to have changed \"operating systems\" in that process? I would say no, I ran \"Ubuntu\" before and after, and Ubuntu swapped out one of the pieces that it uses.

And, obviously, Ubuntu 12.04 is more stable than 12.10 because it's a LTS version (Long Term Supported) and is older than 12.10 (which is not a LTS release). The same occurs with 13.04.\nAs a personal mark, I use LTS version until the non LTS version gives me enough stability or features. In my case nowadays, this depends of the graphic card support, and Ubuntu 12.04 has full support with my AMD driver and Ubuntu 13.04 not yet.\nAnd I use Ubuntu 12.04.2 to daily use, to install my home server and code with C, C++, Java, Scala, Scheme, Python, PHP...\n", "Q: What are good torrent clients that are compatible with ubuntu?

What is the main difference between ppa-purge and add-apt-repository -r. Which one better clear residual items and reason to use one over another? \nDoes add-apt-repository -r should do what ppa-purge do?\nEdit: Also do both remove key from apt's keyring?\n\nA: For what I understand, the difference is what they do after removing the PPA.\nppa-purge - Disables a PPA and reverts to the official packages if applicable. For example, if I added the xorg-edgers PPA and installed the Nvidia drivers, if I do a ppa-purge on said PPA, it would not only disable the xorg-edgers PPA but also revert the NVIDIA drivers from the one in the PPA to the official ones found on the official Ubuntu repositories.\nadd-apt-repository -r - Will only remove the said PPA. Will not revert any packages.\nThe case scenarios might be:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you want to keep a package from a PPA but want to remove the actual PPA. For example, if you wanted to add the Ubuntu Tweak Package from a PPA but then wanted to remove the PPA, you would use add-apt-repository which will leave Ubuntu Tweak installed.\n\n*When you want to go back to an official package and stop using a PPA that has updated/experimental packages (Like Kernel version packages, Proprietary packages...). In this cases you might want to use ppa-purge assuming your intention is to go back to the official versions. Which is the same as removing each PPA package installed and then doing:\nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install PACKAGES\n\nFor most cases, add-apt-repository should be enough to add and remove PPAs. The use of ppa-purge can only help in the small cases where you want to actually remove a package and install the official version which is not common since most user add a PPA to have something better than the one that comes with Ubuntu. Cases like kazam (From Kazam PPA), Proprietary Video drivers (From swat-x or xorg-edgers PPA), and even the Google Chrome and VirtualBox ones. And even if they remove it, it is only 2 or 3 commands to remove the current packages from the removed PPA and install the official ones.\nWith all of this in mind, it simply comes down to what the user wants to do about the packages related to the PPA.\n\nA: The apt-add-repository manpage says this about the command:  \n   REPOSITORY can  be  either  a  line  that  can  be  added  directly  to\n   sources.list(5),  in the form ppa:<user>/<ppa-name> for adding Personal\n   Package Archives, or a distribution component to enable.\n\n   In  the   first   form,   REPOSITORY   will   just   be   appended   to\n   /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\n   In  the second form, ppa:<user>/<ppa-name> will be expanded to the full\n   deb  line  of  the  PPA  and   added   into   a   new   file   in   the\n   /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  directory.   The  GPG public key of the newly\n   added PPA will also be downloaded and added to apt's keyring.\n\n   In the third form, the given distribution component will be enabled for\n   all sources.  \n\nand:  \n-r, --remove Remove the specified repository  \n\nSo add-apt-repository just adds and removes lines from /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.  \nThe ppa-purge manpage says this:  \nNAME\n       ppa-purge - disables a PPA and reverts to official packages\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This script provides a  bash  shell  script  capable  of  automatically\n       downgrading all packages in a given PPA back to the ubuntu versions.\n\n       You  have  to  run  it  using  root  privileges  because of the package\n       manager.  \n\nSo ppa-purge will not only remove a PPA, it will also downgrade any packages back to their default versions. This is useful when testing beta or newer versions of software.\n", "Q: Installing Ruby On Rails stack on Ubuntu?

Any idea why? To better clarify the behaviour of the touchpad: The touchpad moves in slow motion when the power is plugged otherwise, it works perfectly.\n\nA: My guess is that there might actually be something wrong with the power supply as suggested in this clip from Wikipedia:\n\nIf the computer is powered by an external power supply (PSU), the\n  detailed construction of the PSU will influence the virtual ground\n  effect; a touchpad may work properly with one PSU but be jerky or\n  malfunction with another (this does not imply any electrical risk\n  whatsoever, a delicate capacitative ground, not a contact ground, is\n  at issue). This has been known to cause touchpad problems when a\n  manufacturer's PSU, which will have been designed to work with the\n  touchpad, is replaced by a different type. This effect can be checked\n  by touching a metallic part of the computer with the other hand and\n  seeing if operation is restored. In some cases touching the\n  (insulated) power supply with some part of the body, or using the\n  computer on the lap instead of on a desk, while working can restore\n  correct operation.\n\nMaybe try another charger and see if the problem resolves.\n\nA: As I said here and some other people say, a fast workaround is to touch notebook ground: Make a couple of loops around power plug with a clip and touch it while using the touchpad. You can also use any USB cable, just plug it and touch the other end, the metal shield (grounded). You can buy or make a DIY anti-static grounding wrist strap connected to the notebook ground (USB or clip/power plug), like  Roreru's answer.\nIt's a ground loop problem with Synaptics touchpad (Dell Inspiron 14 in my case), maybe related to a bad power supply.﻿ I'll edit this reply if other PSU fix the problem.\nMore info here and here.\n", "Q: Installation of ubuntu from USB flash drive I have gone through the online instructions for installing Ubuntu from a USB flash drive.\nSo it says first that I have to download Ubuntu in order to install it from flash drive.\nSo I downloaded the software. It is a file of type .iso.  So what do I do with this .iso file? How to prepare my USB flash drive so that I reboot and install the Ubuntu?\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nA: You've completed step one, which is to download Ubuntu.\nStep two would be to \"prepare\" the USB flash drive with that .iso file. We call this \"creating a bootable USB flash drive\". If you are on Windows right now, here's what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Universal USB Installer.\n\n*Open up the program, and select your Ubuntu version from the drop-down list. So, for example, if you've downloaded the 32-bit Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop, choose Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop i386.\n\n\n*Using the \"Browse\" button, point to your downloaded .iso file.\n\n\n*Choose your USB flash drive from the drop-down list.\n\nNote: make sure you are choosing the correct USB flash drive and that you have a backup of whatever is on it, because the program will most likely delete everything on it.\n\n\nOnce you are finished with that program, you can now use your USB flash drive to install Ubuntu. So switch off your computer, plug the USB flash drive into it, and turn on the computer. Depending on the settings of your computer, you should see a purple screen within a minute, which is the beginning of the Ubuntu installation. If you don't see a purple screen and your computer boots directly into Windows, you will need to change the settings of your computer to basically tell it to boot from the USB. To do that, you will need to press a specific button when your computer is first powering on. This button is different for different computers, but it's usually one of the function buttons (F1-F12).\nI don't know what guide you're following to install Ubuntu, but you can follow the screenshots in this answer for the Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: Since you need to install it from the flash drive do the following:\nIn Windows\nDownload Lili \nUse Lili to write the .iso file into flash drive.Documentation is available in the lili website\nIn Linux\nDownload Unetbootin and again you can write the ubuntu .iso file into flashdrive using this software\n", "Q: Help with having Windows 7 and Linux on one laptop HDD?

The windows boot manager is conserved. More info here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\n\nA: You should try using a software like Partition Magic to create a separate partition. With it you can create partitions for the free space without losing your data, right from inside Windows. Then you can safely install Ubuntu. You only need about 8GB partition for Ubuntu. \n\nA: I used LinuxLive USB Creator (www.linuxliveusb.com/‎) to create a bootable Ubuntu 13.04 USB Drive and installed alongside Windows via that method. I have a 500GB HDD and opted to split that in half, which can be easily done in the partition manager that is built into the installer. Had no issues with lost data and GRUB gives me the choice whether to boot into Ubuntu (default) or Windows. \nAlternatively, you could partition the drive from within Windows & then run the Ubuntu installer. I prefer to use AOMEI Partition Assistant as it has a good GUI and (I feel) is beginner-friendly.\nUnfortunately I can't find a good guide to help with the process, but the Ubuntu installer makes the whole thing very user friendly.\n\nA: You can use VirtualBox or VMWare to create its virtual machine and can use it from there.\n", "Q: Trying to remove Bluetooth, safe to do?

This will revert back to the old 1 screen configuration and allow you to access your desktop and fix the real problem by:\nFor most systems, I would recommend a reinstall of the drivers and after the re-installation attempt to auto-config again.\nFor installing the proprietary drivers there are 2 \"good\" approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can attempt to install via the ubuntu-x-swat repository. This is the simplest approach. Instructions can be found here.  \n\n*You can attempt to install the latest drivers by downloading them from the nvidia website. Then dropping to main terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F1), stopping the display service \"sudo servive gdm stop\" and then installing the drivers \"sudo ./NVIDIA-versionxxx.sh\". Towards the end of the installation you will be asked if it should auto configure say yes and hopefully this should work and you will have both screens ready to go.\n\n\nSide Notes:\nOption (1) is easier to do and will automatically update the drivers as you update the system (essentially less maintenance).\nOption (2) will require you to reinstall the drivers every time the kernel is updated more maintenance but you will always have the latest proprietary drivers.\nHope that helps. \nEDIT:\nIf you decide to attempt Option(2) after Option(1) remember to remove the old drivers by \"sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current\" \n", "Q: Installing 13.04 Server on Hardware raid 0.

Before I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on dual boot windows 7 doesn't boot this long. is there anyway to fix this?\n\nA: I had a similar problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 was already installed (and working well)\n\n*Installed Ubuntu 13.04 with option to install alongside existing OS\n\n\nThen, Windows 7 took a long time (2-3 mins) to boot.  Plus, it was very slow, system sounds played distorted, and the touchpad was sluggish.\nUnfortunately, I do not have a good solution; I booted with a live Ubuntu USB stick, and ran \"OS Uninstaller\" to remove the Ubuntu installation on the machine.  Afterwards, Windows 7 runs much better.\nI suspect that it has something to do with booting Windows 7 from the GRUB menu instead of through it's own bootloader, but I did not have a chance to investigate.\n", "Q: Boot and run from USB Is it possible for me to run and use Ubuntu or other Linux from USB and it will remember what I did??? Like if I installed it on a computer?? Eg. if I write a dockument, will it remember it and how do I do it?\nI have tried all the programs I have found on the net, but nothing helped, is it even possible? Hope for answer. \n\nA: If you install a Live-Disk to a USB-Drive with the startup disk creator you can create a space on the drive to store the information which was created during Ubuntu was running from USB Drive.\nTake a look at the linked page. In picture 6 you can see the option, called \"Stored in reserved extra space\".\n", "Q: Use both suspend-freeze and pm-suspend I'm using Ubuntu Raring and mainline kernel 3.9.4\nI like the fast resume times pm-suspend-freeze is capable of, however I still want to have the lower power consuming suspend available. From what I've read it's only possible to use one or the other:\nhttp://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges#head-82ff281c802c350623a8b7dec846e8754a87ef40\nIdeally, I'd be able to close my laptop and ps-suspend-freeze would be executed. However if I went in the power menu and chose suspend in the top right of Unity the traditional pm-suspend (to memory) command would be executed.\nThis would give me the ability to hop in and out of suspend-freeze and quickly use the laptop, close the lid and save power by idling. And if I plan to not use it for a few hours, suspend to memory.\n\nA: The power savings in the freeze state are almost nothing, so if you have a working suspend to ram, you should stick with that.  It normally only takes around 3-4 seconds so should be plenty snappy.  Most of that time is usually dominated by waiting for the hard disk to spin up, so if you really want fast suspend/resume, you can disable that with:\nsudo -s\ncd /sys/block/sda/device/scsi_disk/*\necho 0 > manage_start_stop\n\nThis will leave the disk off when you resume until you actually try to access it, giving more power savings and faster resume.\n", "Q: Mysql server installed but not running I tried to install mysql 5.6.12 using the following procedure\n# Preconfiguration setup\nshell> groupadd mysql\nshell> useradd -r -g mysql mysql\n# Beginning of source-build specific instructions\nshell> tar zxvf mysql-VERSION.tar.gz\nshell> cd mysql-VERSION\nshell> cmake .\nshell> make\nshell> make install\n# End of source-build specific instructions\n# Postinstallation setup\nshell> cd /usr/local/mysql\nshell> chown -R mysql .\nshell> chgrp -R mysql .\nshell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql\nshell> chown -R root .\nshell> chown -R mysql data\n# Next command is optional\nshell> cp support-files/my-default.cnf /etc/my.cnf\nshell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &\n# Next command is optional\nshell> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql.server\n\nSource: [Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution][1]\nNow the problem is\nI did\n shell> /etc/init.d/mysql.server start\n\n *  Mysql is running\n\nBut when I do something like\n shell> mysql\n\n The program 'mysql' is currently not installed.

As usual, My first step after buying a new laptop is to install Ubuntu. \nHence followed this guide - Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI and disabled secure boot (UEFI is still enabled) and installed Ubuntu 13.04 \nNow restarted my system. Now I don't see grub. When I selected F10 to enter boot options, I see both Ubuntu and Windows boot manager options. I am able to enter Windows but when i select Ubtuntu, it takes me to grub command line but not GUI. I even tried repairing with boot manager but still it didn't help. boot repair continues till some steps and fails saying - \"Please close all your package managers and continue\" . I have verified that there are no package managers running. But still it says the same. Here is my boot repair summary - http://paste.ubuntu.com/5779528/\nI tried other ways as well but was not able to boot into Ubuntu.\nPlease help. Thanks\n\n\nA: I recommend you try installing my rEFInd boot manager, which will bypass GRUB. If you install it from Windows, be sure to keep the EFI drivers for x86-64, or at least the ext4fs driver. GRUB still seems to be unreliable on EFI-based computers, and fixing those problems can be very difficult, particularly if Boot Repair doesn't work.\nIf you prefer to stick with GRUB and Boot Repair, one thing I noticed in your output is this:\nThe boot of your PC is in Legacy mode. You may want to retry after changing it to EFI mode.\nDo you want to continue?\n\nBooting in EFI mode will make for a more reliable repair, although I doubt if booting in BIOS/legacy mode would cause the complete failure you've encountered. Unfortunately, how to force an EFI-mode vs. a BIOS/legacy-mode boot varies from one computer to another. Usually you can do it through the computer's own boot manager, which is usually activated by hitting a function key at boot time, but details vary greatly.\nAnother thing I noticed in your output is this:\nchroot /mnt/boot-sav/sda7 apt-get -y --force-yes update\nE: List directory /var/lib/apt/lists/partial is missing. - Acquire (2: No such file or directory)\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (2: No such file or directory)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\n\nI'm not familiar enough with Boot Repair's internals to know precisely what's going on, but the last three words of this output (\"are you root?\") may be critical. In order to do its work, Boot Repair must be run as root. Some Linux emergency discs, such as Parted Magic and System Rescue CD, run everything as root by default. If you're using an Ubuntu disc, though, you may need to precede the Boot Repair command with sudo to launch it as root.\nThis message could also suggest a problem with your Ubuntu installation. It could be that something went wrong with the installation, thus causing these errors. If so, you might need to re-install Ubuntu from scratch.\n", "Q: \"No installable Kernel was found in the defined APT sources\" I'm trying to install an old ubuntu-10.04.4-server-amd64.iso on a custom machine, which uses a vortex86 processor.

It behaves like this because sqlite developers don't want to make sqlite dependent on readline (the library that gives the arrow functionality to the shell) because it isn't in all GNU/Linux distributions. And, therefore, they don't distribute the binary including the readline features.\nIn order to have a more standard sqlite shell, you will have to build sqlite from source. It isn't that difficult, simply run these commands inside a temporal directory:\napt-get source sqlite3\ncd sqlite3-*\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nAfter that, you should be able to enter in the your own-built version just typing sqlite3.\nMore info here.\n\nAs for the \"exiting command\", Ctrl + Z actually pauses the program being run and sends it in background. If you want to exit from sqlite shell you should use Ctrl + D\n", "Q: How to change default font size in menus after Wine? I am using Wine 1.4.1 to run MS Word 2010 in Ubuntu 12.10.

I know there is not a problem with my router because other devices connect fine, and my computer connects through ethernet. I had no problem connecting to wifi in 10.10 before I updated today. \nThere is nothing about wireless at all in the network icon. I have tried downloading and installing several drivers but I'm really not sure what I'm doing. I've tried following the directions in all the questions that are similar to mine... \n\nA: For some reason, probably a copyright issue, Ubuntu had to remove the firmware for the Broadcom 43* cards from the default install. As a remedy, there  are installation packages available. The one for bcm4312 is called \"firmware-b43-lpphy-installer\". You can install it by using the package manager front-end of your choice (I recommend synaptic), or simply by running the following on command line:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-lpphy-installer\n\nAfter installing it, you should either reload the b43 kernel module, or simply reboot. If your computer does not automatically load the b43 module at reboot after you installed the firmware, you can try to load it manually by running (in a terminal)\nsudo modprobe b43\n\nIf manual loading works, you can add a line saying \"b43\" to /etc/modules (you need to edit this file as root for instance by running \"sudo gedit /etc/modules\" on the terminal) to force Ubuntu to load it at boot.\nIf that doesn't work, you can also try \"firmware-b43-installer\".\n", "Q: problem with PATH when using $su OK, I'm having a bit of an issue with PATH and running a process as another user under Ubuntu.\nFirst, we check where the bin is:\nroot@host:~# whereis start-stop-daemon\nstart-stop-daemon: /sbin/start-stop-daemon /usr/share/man/man8/start-stop-daemon.8.gz\n\nok, /sbin/start-stop-daemon so ti's in /sbin.\nthen we check path as a user we want to run the app:\nroot@host:~# su wojtek -c \"echo $PATH\"\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nroot@host:~# su -l wojtek -c \"echo $PATH\"\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nin both cases the PATH is exactly the same (ie. in normal su and with full login) yet there is a distinction when we actually want to run the command:\nroot@host:~# su wojtek -c \"start-stop-daemon\"\nbash: start-stop-daemon: command not found\n\nroot@host:~# su -l wojtek -c \"start-stop-daemon\"\nstart-stop-daemon: need one of --start or --stop or --status\nTry 'start-stop-daemon --help' for more information.\n\nCan somebody try to explain where the difference comes from? Because for me there shouldn't be any error as there is no difference in PATH thus $start-stop-daemon for a given user should work either way...\nalso - if I switch to different user ($su user and $su - user) then $start-stop-daemon in both cases...\nwhat am I missing?\n\nA: The path appears to be the same in your two statements because $PATH has been expanded within the double quotes before being passed to the su command.\nTry it with single quotes and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised:\nsu wojtek -c 'echo $PATH'\n\nvs\nsu -l wojtek -c 'echo $PATH'\n\n", "Q: \"Something wicked happened\"

I've noticed  Software updater in 12.10 installs updates without asking for my password the way it used to.\nMy question is, how is it doing this and what is to prevent a malicious script/program using the same technique executing privileged commands without my password or in fact without me even knowing?\n\nA: This is the way it works now all updates require a password in versions prior to 11.10 but since 11.10 the password is no longer requested for security updates.\nA password is still required to install software and for updates that are not for security however.\nFrom the Security Team FAQ:\n\nUpdate Manager doesn't prompt for security updates\nWhy does update-manager no longer prompt for the user's password?\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*As of Ubuntu 11.10, update-manager no longer prompts for the user's password to apply updates. This was decided to improve usability and\n  to make it easier for users to apply security updates and therefore\n  increase system security. The rationale is as follows:\n  \n*Like in previous releases, by default only people in the admin group are allowed access to perform security updates.\n  \n*Only updates for already installed software can be applied without a password. Installing additional software still requires people to\n  enter their password.\n          The password prompt had become an irritant for some people such that they would just press 'Cancel' instead of installing the\n  updates. The password prompt decreased system security for those\n  users.\n  \n*People that did dutifully apply updates became conditioned to enter their privileged password perhaps daily. When the user is prompted for\n  the password, it should mean something and the frequency of\n  update-manager updates meant that some people no longer thought about\n  why they were entering their password. For these users, the password\n  prompt had the potential to reduce security. \n  \n*For environments where this change is deemed not appropriate, this functionality can be disabled by the administrator via PolicyKit or by\n  creating users that are not in the admin group (a recommended practice\n  to begin with).\n\n", "Q: What is an extended partition for? Is it comes by default when Ubuntu installed via a CD? What an extended partition is for? Is it comes by default when Ubuntu installed via a CD? If not why I see an extended partition in my Ubuntu 12.04 OS?\nThank you.\n\nA: The partition table has room for only four partitions. For more partitions, one of these four partitions can be divided into many smaller partitions, called logical partitions. The original four are then called primary partitions. If a primary partition is subdivided in this way, it is known as an extended primary or extended partition. \nTypically, the first primary partition will be small ( /dev/hda1, say). The second primary partition will fill the rest of the disk as an extended partition ( /dev/hda2, say). In this case, the entries in the partition table of / dev/hda3 and /dev/hda4 will be blank. The extended partition can be subdivided repeatedly to give /dev/hda5, /dev/hda6, and so on. \n", "Q: Apache & LDAP authentication I am in the process of merging two LDAP directories to one server.

I want to find this command, and then call it up in vi.\nThanks.\nfind . -name 'id.properties'\n\n\nA: To edit the files printed by find:\nfind . -name 'id.properties' -exec vi {} +\n\nIn plain English, this finds paths in the current directory (.) and all subdirectories with a base name of id.properties. With these files it runs a vi file1 file2 [...] command (-exec vi {} +). If there are very many files (typically thousands), it might even run more than one vi command, each with a bunch of files, to be able to fit the commands into the maximum command length of your system. To force it to run the command for each file you could use \\; instead of +.\nTo edit the text printed by find:\nfind . -name 'id.properties' | vi -\n\nThis writes the paths (relative to the current directory) of any files found (because by default find has a hidden -print at the end) to its standard output, which is connected (|) to vi's standard input. vi, in turn, reads from standard input (-) and shows that as a file to be edited.\n\nA: You can push the output in a textfile and open it with vi.\nfind . -name 'id.properties' >> /home/<user>/find.txt\nvi /home/<user>/find.txt\n\n\nA: This answer seems most straight forward.

Please Help.\n\nA: It really depends on why you wanted to use the latest version in the first place. In the case of a product like Apache, the version that is available via the official repository will continue to get security updates during its life cycle, so that is not a reason to install the very latest version.\nI would always advise using officially packaged versions of software - either from Ubuntu or direct from the vendor if they have their own repository, unless you have a very good reason not to such as a new feature you cannot live without.

I am running Ubuntu 13.04 on a Lenovo Thinkpad E420s. I am having a problem with the timing of device loading during startup. I assume this was always happening, but I did not realize it was an issue until I switched to an SSD and my system began starting up much quicker.\nThe primary issue is that the TrackPoint does not get loaded until well after the desktop loads.

I'm running 13.04 on an acer c7 (chrubuntu 12.04 install then two system upgrades) and now whenever I use my computer for more than a few minutes, it slows down as polkitd, dbus-daemon, console-kit-daemon, and networkmanager chew up all my system resources. I tried googling this issue but it does not seem to be very widespread, or I'm just missing something. \nI've tried looking at my system logs but nothing seems especially unusual there. I've also tried looking at the dbus-monitor. I'm not completely sure what I'm looking for there, but there does not seem to be a constant stream of activity. Is there some other way to see what polkitd and / or these other processes are going?\nI would also appreciate any thoughts on how to fix this issue.\nThanks!\n\nA: I had the same problem with high CPU usage after closing the lid on my Acer C710 Chromebook running chrUbuntu 13.04.  On my system, dbus-monitor --system shows a swarm of NameOwnerChanged messages, about 30 per second.  These repeatedly wake up everybody on the dbus, particularly polkitd, but also network manager, nm-applet, etc.\nBut DBus is only doing this because acpid keeps repeatedly running the /etc/acpid/lid.sh script.  This, in turn, is due to an overactive ACPI interrupt line, exactly the same problem as on this question:\nWhy does kworker cpu usage get so high?\nFor my system, the problem was in /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe1F, and echoing \"disable\" to this interrupt immediately stopped the CPU usage.  This results in a system that does exactly nothing when the lid is closed, but I can still \"sudo pm-suspend\" from the console, and opening the lid or pressing a keyboard wakes normally.\nAnd more importantly, CPU usage is down to nearly zero!\n\nA: I've had the same symptom, in my case it was Nepomuk drowning dbus in a flood of activity. I imagine there are a million ways to create that same symptom, though.\ndbus-monitor was a great place to start. Did you try dbus-monitor --system as well as dbus-monitor --session ?\nYou might snoop on those other high-CPU consumers with strace, see what they're opening/closing/sending.\nEasy way to open strace for a process by name:\nsudo strace -p$(ps -ef |grep console-kit-daemon |grep -v grep |awk '{print $2}') \n\n\nA: Pulled from: https://askubuntu.com/a/233947\nI can't comment on another answer, but from the highest rated answer, it says to echo \"disabled\" into an interrupt in order to disable an overactive ACPI line.  To find which interrupt, run this:\ngrep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/\n\nThen, look for the answer with the high number.  Echo disable into that file and you should be good to go.\nThe source link at the top has full info on how to make it persistent after suspend and reboot, but click his answer, I don't deserve any credit for that.\n", "Q: How to automatically add '&' after each command in a terminal I use guake as a sort of \"run\" command, because my lxde launcher often misbehaves.

The curently workspace is, as its name itself says, the space where curently you are. Now, when you connect another display at the machine, the current workspace (and all others) will be expanded in the new display. When you change the workspace in first display, its expansion will change in the second display as well and vice-versa. So, the display is a something like a 'child' of the workspace.

To install a game, click the button on the right-hand sidebar that says \"Install a program\". Once in that menu just use the search bar to find \"The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim\", click to install. This will automatically download the version of WINE that is known to work with Skyrim as well as install Steam on the virtual drive, if you so select. \nThe installation may throw an error, but they usually provide you with information on how to fix it, commonly in the form of a link to a \"How to fix problem X\" type page.

We have a new computer and I love the Ubuntu design, but the code-stuff is a bit hard for me... \nSo here is my question:\nI just downloaded something from youtube and converted it to an mp3. I have last.fm, that is a site that connects between the media player and the site, and it stores your listening history. When I play my song it says \"unknown artist\". When I go to my downloads, the song and then properties and click on audio I can not change a thing! How can I change the title, artist and all that other stuff?\nThe answers that I think I found are with all these weird codes and I don't even know if that is the solution for my \"problem\"..\nThanks for responding!\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't support editing id3 tags by default. You will have to use a seperate application to do it. Rhythmbox can provide this functionality and comes preinstalled in Ubuntu.\nOpen the mp3 file in Rhythmbox. \nRight click the song in Rhythmbox and select Properties. This will give you options for changing Artist/Album/Title etc.\n\n\nA: The Artist's Name, Album Title, Year etc (which you can view when you click properties ), are called ID3 tags.\nIn that case you would have to search for ID3 editors to edit that piece of information. You could take a quick look at the Ubuntu Software Centre or look at the internet. ( EasyTag for example, as mentioned in Mitch's answer ).\nI think you will be able to edit that information with Rhythmbox (preinstalled) as well as with Clementine.\n\nA: If you want to rename the file just right click on the file in file manager and select rename as shown\n\n\nIf however what you want to do is edit the mp3 tags: Title, Artist etc.  You can do that in Rhythmbox.  Right click on the mp3 file select properties\n\nYou can edit in the box that opens.\n\nThere are also other applications in the software centre which may be better if you have a lot of these to edit; such as EasyTag\n\nA: Try EasyTAG\nEasyTAG is an utility for viewing, editing and writing the ID3 tags of different audio files, using a GTK+ interface.\nTo install click EasyTAG \nSource: Ubuntu Apps\n\nA: You can do that with Clementine. Open your file with Clementine, select your track in the playlist, right click on the song and click on \"Edit track information\". If you do not want to right click on your track you can also use the Ctrl + E keyboard shortcut.\nI know that other answers tell you to use Rhythmbox instead of Clementine but this last has got an advantage. It has got a feature which is able to find the missing informations for you ! A kind of Shazam in a way. For this, open your file with Clementine, select your track in the playlist, right click on the song and click on \"Complete tags automatically\". If you do not want to right click on your track you can also use the Ctrl + T keyboard shortcut.

Thanks in advance!\n\nA: You first need to decide whether having a stable platform that you wont need to update for a long time is more important to you or having the latest features.\nIf you decide on Long term stability you will want the latest LTS release; which at the time of writing is 12.04.  If you want the latest features its currently 13.04.\nAs 8.04 is really old and no longer supported I would strongly recommend you do a clean install.  You will get a much cleaner system.\nBackup your personal data on at least two external devices: External USB drives, DVDs, etc.\nInstall a supported release letting it overwrite the existing version.  Finally restore your personal data from the backup.\nNote: computers don't screw up often but when they do its easy to lose a lot of irreplaceable information so if your data is important to you keep it backed up.\nPersonally I have all my home computers backed up and stored in the company fire safe.

I am running Ubuntu 13.04 on a 2011 Dell XPS L501X laptop: Intel core i5, Nvidia Geforce GT 420M graphics card, 6gb ram, etc. I had no problems during normal computing until installing and attempting to play Minecraft on the machine.  Extreme lag led me to investigate things, as this was not a problem with Windows. \nI learned that the Ubuntu os does not seem to recognize my graphics card, and instead mentions Intel Ironlake graphics under my system information. After not finding any appropriate driver downloads on the Nvidia site, I followed the instructions given here on noobslab. \nAfter restarting my computer, I was able to log into my account, but then all that was displayed was my desktop background image.

Thanks!\n\nA: What you have is hybrid graphics. Basically, you have 2 video cards:\n\n\n*\n\n*an integrated one, embedded in your i5 CPU (Intel);\n\n*a discrete one, namely the NVIDIA one.\n\n\nThis hybrid graphics solution is intented to work like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*when you do basic, light graphical stuff, automatically use the integrated card to save power (and sleep the discrete card, of course);\n\n*when you do advanced, heavy graphical stuff, automatically use the discrete card so the job can be done properly (and sleep the integrated card, of course).\n\n\nIn order for this magic to happen, some special software is needed, namely the NVIDIA Optimus: http://www.nvidia.com/object/optimus_technology.html\nYou'll see a (not) nice note in the link above: \"Optimus requires Windows 7 or later\".\nSo, no love from NVIDIA to Linux regarding Optimus. See this for a laugh: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_36yNWw_07g\nWhat happens in your case is that you ALWAYS end up using the integrated card, no matter what you do (or what NVIDIA driver you install).\nWhat can be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*some notebooks with this hybrid graphics provide a choice in BIOS that would allow you to disable the integrated card (Intel) and ALWAYS use the discrete card (NVIDIA) - you have to check your BIOS for such setting for yourself - then, you'll have only 1 active video card in your system and it will be the NVIDIA one (resulting in Linux properly identifying your video card);\n\n*look at the Bumblebee project: http://bumblebee-project.org/index.html\nGood luck and let us know what happens!\n", "Q: How to configure Geany to wrap lines?

The title might need some adjusting but what I am trying to say is that, when one drags a window to the left or right side of the screen, it resizes to fill that half of the screen. So if I drag 2 windows, one to the left and one to the right, I can have to 2 windows that use the whole screen and do not overlap. For example, for cases where I want to explain about web programming and on one window I have the code and on the other I have the web browser.\nNow, what if I wanted to have 4 instead of 2. One window would resize to take the top-left, the other the top-right, then 2 more would take the bottom-left and bottom-right. All of this would take those positions if I dragged them to their respective corners (eg: The top-left window would resize to that position if I drag it to the top-left corner of the screen, the bottom-right would resize to that position if I drag it to the bottom-right corner of the screen).\nSo how can I add 2 more positions so Unity handles all of this 4 positions instead of only 2?\n\nA: I think you can edit the EDGE settings in GRID using the CompizConfig Setting Manager\n(to install this run sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager in a terminal).\n\nIf you set the corner setting (i.e setting Upper Left Corner to Top Left Corner) then when you drag the windows to the corners, it will \"SNAP\"\n\nA: Ok found the option using Compiz (We need CompizConfig Settings Manager installed).

This is to avoid any weird graphics effects.\nNow what you have is a system where, if you drag a window to one of the corners, it will get assigned to that corner and not the half of the screen. So dragging a windows to the bottom-left will assign the window to the bottom-left grid. Dragging it to the top-right corner, will assign the window to the top-right grid and the left and right screens (Left and Right halves of the screen) will still work just by dragging the window to either the Left or Right of the screen.\nThe final output should be something like this:\n\n", "Q: Can't get fullscreen resolution on Ubuntu hosted on VirtualBox I'm running Ubunutu 13.04 in VirtualBox.

For Vbox 6.1, Ubuntu 20 LTS host and guest OS, most time the non-resize-able VM screen issue results from the so-called \"Seamless Mode\", which provides a miniature screen for ease-of-use by the administrators.\nTo avoid this issue, one can first change the \"Maximum Guest Screen Size window\" from \"Automatic\" to \"Hint\", then set \"Width\" and \"Height\" to the Maximum Screen sizes the host machine allows, e.g. 3840x2160 for 4K display. This change should be done when one is starting the VM.\nAfter that, switch VM to use \"scale mode\". The switch option is available under \"View\" menu item of the VM when it is on the way of starting.\nThis should solve the screen resize issue for nowadays systems. Don't worry about the Guest Addition, it has been embodied into Virtualbox package already. Check \"File\"->\"Preference\"->\"Extensions\" and one can find it.\n\nA: Go to the VirtualBox options while in your VM (the same place you went to to install Guest Additions) and select View -> Auto-resize Guest Display. This should automatically set your VM's resolution to the proper screen size.\n\nA: If you are facing a similar issue, and none of the above worked check this:\nMachine settings -> Display -> Screen -> Video memory\nset it to the maximun\n", "Q: 13.04 exception with latest AMD/ATI driver - How do I go about reporting this?

However, you need to back up in a very precisely correct manner and evaluate whether you really need to take from a /home partition which is already too small.\n\"What should I do\" is of course the intuitive question but it is a bit broad so tailoring an answer is not quite as straightforward. Your goals and objectives are not entirely clear.\nIf the problem is that you are cramped in your root directory, you might simply delete unecessary software, as a start, and that will tide you over until you can add another disk drive or properly research your options, backup everything, and implement a plan.\nWithout more detailed picture of the status of the computer and what your  purposes are, we must accept your apparent presumption that it is correct to cannablize your /home partition to beef up your root.\nThat seems to be robbing Peter to pay Paul and not necessarily a solution. It is theoretically possible to use portions of the Windows partition for data which might otherwise be on your Ubuntu /home partition. This is not a very good solution to your dilemna because it is infinitely preferable to have your data on a /home partition which is not viewable from windows. This provides a layer of privacy and security whether or not you have encrypted your Ubuntu partition.The problem is worse if your Ubuntu partition is encrypted, as any use of the windows partition will push you into use of unencrypted partition space.\nSo I would ask whether you have exhausted the possibility of shrinking your windows partition rather than your /home partition.That would provide you with a more viable long term strategy that won't cramp your Ubuntu /home directories and as an added bonus minimize the prospect of harming your Ubuntu partitions. \nWhatever you decide, it is imperative to thoroughly back up both /home and root. This means backing up your hidden files not just the visible files. \nMany partition management utilities allow for backing up and entire partition\nvia a \"copy partition\" function.\nIf you are interested in addressing the strategy of shrinking the windows partition please peruse the forum and post a new question if need be as I won't clutter this thread with that procedure unless you elect to go that route.\nA final point is not to overlook the prospect of using the existing swap partition in some manner or even shifting other parts of the hard drive. Again, a screenshot from gparted would be very nice and helpful as well as your situation with regard to that massive windows partition which is taking up 5/6th of your hard drive! \nCheers. \n", "Q: No Unity, launcher and dash on Ubuntu 13.04 within VirtualBox4.2.12 after enabel 3D Acceleration I was using Ubuntu 12.10 in my VirtualBox4.2.12 on my Windows7 Host.

I am running netbeans 7.3.1 on ubuntu 12.04.2 x64. I wrote some fortran code and saved it to an ext4 internal drive that I have.

But, when I save and compile the code in my home directory, it seems to run just fine. \nNow as a pre-empt to the common issues. the partition that is having the trouble is an ext4 partition, so it is not a FAT or NTFS partition where I cannot run executables from Ubuntu.

My question is about how to add a few lines to the /etc/default/grub file so that it is automatically reflected each time /boot/grub/grub.cfg is regenerated.  The details:\nI'm running ubuntu on a Macbook Pro 8.2 and one of the things that I had to do to get it to run correctly was alter the grub.cfg so that it only loads one of the two graphics cards.  To turn off one of the cards I added the text concerning i915 in the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i915.lvds_channel_mode=2 i915.modeset=1 i915.lvds_use_ssc=0\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nThe problem is that I must also have the following adding to /etc/grub.cfg:\n  outb 0x728 1\n  outb 0x710 2\n  outb 0x740 2\n  outb 0x750 0\n\nWhich I've added in context in grub.cfg as so:\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-simple-1e8685ef-b6a8-4bf3-abb8-62d0212cea7c' {\nrecordfail\nload_video\ngfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\ninsmod gzio\ninsmod part_gpt\ninsmod reiserfs\noutb 0x728 1\noutb 0x710 2\noutb 0x740 2\noutb 0x750 0\nset root='hd0,gpt4'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,gpt4 --hint-efi=hd0,gpt4 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,gpt4  21c34907-4da5-4356-b1c8-a5d2747411ed\nelse...\n\nHow can I add this to the /etc/default/grub file so that I don't have to manually add it to the grub.cfg every time Ubuntu updates?  Currently it appears as if each time Ubuntu updates it regenerates the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file from the /etc/default/grub file and it'd be helpful if these four lines could be included as well.\n\nA: Do not edit the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file. Edit the /etc/grub.d/10_linux file:\nAdd your commands to the\n  cat << EOF\n    insmod gzio\nEOF\n\nsection, so it should read:\n  cat << EOF\n    insmod gzio\n    outb 0x728 1\n    outb 0x710 2\n    outb 0x740 2\n    outb 0x750 0\nEOF\n\nThis file is sourced every time update-grub is run, and it is rarely overwritten by updates. (Or at least it will ask when you update whether you want to update this file or keep your modified version.)\n\nA: You must edit the configuration scripts directly. There's no way to add outb 0x728 1 to the grub.conf file, since the scripts that sources the variables there doesn't know how to manage these entries. This is said in the info pages:\n\nFor more detailed customisation of 'grub-mkconfig''s output, you may\n  edit the scripts in '/etc/grub.d' directly.  '/etc/grub.d/40_custom' is\n  particularly useful for adding entire custom menu entries; simply type\n  the menu entries you want to add at the end of that file, making sure\n  to leave at least the first two lines intact.\n\nSo, what to do, for the linux entries, you may want to edit the /etc/grub.d/10_linux file, very carefully. You may look for the linux () function and study it's internals. The whole thing is very complex and I wouldn't touch it without a backup. You can see the output of the file just running /etc/grub.d/10_linux in your shell, then look where you want to add your special lines, edit it, execute it again and see if you are happy with the results.\n\nA: To be honest, easiest way would be to backup the 2 files and each time Ubuntu updates, you run a script as root ofc:\n#!/bin/sh\nrm /boot/grub/grub && /boot/grub/grub.cfg\ncp /directory/grub /boot/grub/\ncp /directory/grub.cfg /boot/grub/\n\nOne thing, change /directory/ to your directory to the files :)\n", "Q: Issue With App In The Software Center Hey I got my app published in the software center, (Yay!) but now I have a different. problem.

The EXE may not run or may run but not work correctly.\n\nA: You need to install Wine or PlayOnLinux (I would recommend this one) from Ubuntu Software Center. Also worth attention is CrossOver software, but it isn't free.\nPlease notice that not all Windows programs are easy to run in Linux environment.\n\nA: WINE stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator, it is in fact a compatibility layer and is capable to run .EXE files in a Linux environment, by installing this you will be presented with a program which holds an icon displaying a wine glass containing red wine. Installing this will allow the use of many Windows-like programs, directories etc and is required for PlayOnLinux; be aware that WINE has limited capability and may run slower than that of a Windows machine but this is to be expected. \nI used to run Steam using Wine and didn't achieve nearly the performance of that the Steam for Ubuntu provided.

Now my system stopped booting in graphical mode. \nCan anyone tell me, How can i delete /tmp of my VM without affecting my VM.\nThanks\n\nA: If what you want is to just delete the content of the /temp folder of your VM but without the need to boot the VM OS, all you need is a Linux LiveCD (your choice here, I would recommend a small one to get it fast from the Internet if you don't have one at hand). \nUse the LiveCD iso as the boot device in your VM, boot the VM with the LiveCD iso, accesss your partition with the /temp folder and delete what you wish. Finally, reboot and you're done (don't forget to change the VM settings to remove the LiveCD iso as boot device so you boot the VM OS when you reboot).\nGood luck and let us know what happens!\n", "Q: Help Understanding Line in .bashrc I've tried looking everywhere to determine what this line does in my .bashrc. The reason I want to know is because now ~/.pam_environment is recommended. This is the line:\n[[ -s /home/$USER/.nvm/nvm.sh ]] && . /home/$USER/.nvm/nvm.sh\n\nI think I've narrowed it to the condition checks to make sure the nvm.sh file exists and that it is larger than 0 bytes. But I don't understand what follows. && normally means \"and\" but I don't understand why that would be necessary after a check and also why the . is not attached to the filename. \nBasically what I want to know is, how would I put this in my .pam_environment file which only takes assigment expressions. \nEdit: This line currently allows me to run NVM from the terminal but I'd really like to know just for the sake of learning.\n\nA: Yes, you are correct that [[ -s ... ] checks whether a file exists. If it does, it will exit with the status 0, and if it doesn't, it will exit as 1 (i.e. fail).\nThe && command/operator/whatever runs the next command if the command before it succeeded (i.e. the exit status is 0). ||, on the contrary, runs the next command if the command before failed (i.e. not 0).\nHaving . before the filename (with whitespace in-between) runs the file, but also keeps any environmental variable changes it does. For example, if I make test.sh as this:\n#!/bin/bash\nFOO=bar\nBAR=baz\nBAZ=foo\nPATH=\"FOO:$PATH\"\n\nand I run . path/to/test.sh, there will be new variables: FOO, BAR, and BAZ, and PATH will be updated.

Instead, you'd need something like this:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nI make no promises that this will work, though; GRUB is very finicky when it comes to booting Windows, and what works on one computer often fails on another.\nI don't know why your /etc/grub.d/40_custom file was wiped clean. This is the first time I've heard of that happening. My only guess is that Boot Repair, or some other tool intended to help fix GRUB problems, might be responsible.\nYou might have better luck replacing or supplementing GRUB with another boot manager, such as gummiboot or my own rEFInd. These programs are less finicky about booting Windows, and they can also boot Linux kernels that include the EFI stub loader, which means most 3.3.0 and later kernels. In the case of rEFInd, installing the Debian binary package should set everything up correctly, provided that you have not run Boot Repair. If you have run Boot Repair, you should undo its file-juggling act before proceeding; if you don't, you'll get GRUB when you try to launch Windows.\nSince you say you want to learn more about this subject, I recommend my Web page on EFI boot loaders.

This can be done by pressing the SHIFT-Button while clicking on reply, reply all, forward, etc. ...\nSo with Thunderbird Conversations, as Jonathan said, the standard would be plain text, but by pressing SHIFT while clicking, you would end up with an HTML message.

No, it's better. free is wasted memory, it's RAM sitting there with zeroes or some other useless crap in it. cache is where you keep data recently read from the disk, where there would otherwise be useless garbage, in case the system wants to read that part of the disk again any time soon. \nWhenever a process wants more memory, cache is given to it as readily as free. free is the money you spent on RAM being utterly useless, cache is Linux making some use of it (so long as nothing else wants it). \nMore info here: http://www.linuxatemyram.com/\n", "Q: Why my php scripts doesn't get executed?

You are lucky, in this model it is really easy to clean the cpu cooler. You may only open the small cover of the CPU/RAM, unscrew the cooling system and it's cover and clean the dust from the fins. NOT only the dust from the fan. Think that it is the only way your laptop \"breathes\" and it is blocked with a \"blanket\" made of dust! You may also replace the thermal compound. These two together will for sure make things a lot better.\nVideos such this may help you. (you need only the first two minutes of this)\nAs for the software part:\nTry the AMD's proprietary driver for the GPU. In my case (other model), it lowered the temperature a lot. Although, maybe things have changed latelly as for the power-saving features of the open source drivers.\n", "Q: Install text mode Ubuntu I have to run four OSs simultaneously and do not need graphical desktop. and I have only Ubuntu desktop CD.\nIs it possible to install Ubuntu desktop without graphical environment?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu Server.

It does a good job at finding information in files. Indexing is however slow and takes a lot of resources. This is not a problem if you do not run Recoll as a daemon, but only update the index manually when you're not using the computer.\nTo install it:\nsudo apt install recoll\n\n\nA: I have the similar problem with OpenDocument (ODT document, OTT template) and Microsoft Word (DOC and DOCX documents, DOT and DOTX templates) files.\nCurrently, I'm happy with the following Bash script for recursive search:\n#!/bin/sh\nif [ \"$#\" -ne 1 ]; then\n    echo $\"Usage: $(basename \"$0\") search_pattern\"\n    echo \"You should have installed the following packages: odt2txt, docx2txt and libreoffice-writer\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nsearch_pattern=\"$1\"\nprintf \"Looking for: $search_pattern\\n\"\n\nfind . -name '*.odt' -o -name '*.ott' -o \\\n  -name '*.docx' -o -name '*.dotx' -o \\\n     -name '*.doc' -o -name '*.dot' \\\n     -type f | while read -r doc; do\n\n    doc_fullfilename=$(basename -- \"$doc\")\n    doc_filename=\"${doc_fullfilename%.*}\"\n    doc_filetype=\"${doc_fullfilename##*.}\"\n\n    case $doc_filetype in\n        'odt' | 'ott')\n        (odt2txt \"$doc\" 2>/dev/null | grep -i \"$search_pattern\") && echo \"^ found in ODT/OTT: $doc\" && echo\n        ;;\n        'docx' | 'dotx')\n        (docx2txt \"$doc\" - 2>/dev/null | grep -i \"$search_pattern\") && echo \"^ found in DOCX/DOTX: $doc\" && echo\n        ;;\n        'doc'| 'dot')\n        out_dir=/tmp\n        lowriter --headless --convert-to txt:Text \"$doc\" --outdir \"$out_dir\" 2>&1 > /dev/null\n        grep -i \"$search_pattern\" \"$out_dir/$doc_filename.txt\" && echo \"^ found in DOC/DOT: $doc\" && echo\n        ;;\n    esac\n: ; done\n\n\nIt shows search results and file-names.\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*the script uses three external programs - odt2txt (for ODT/OTT), docx2txt (for DOCX/DOTX), libreoffice-writer (for DOC/DOT).\n\n*theoretically, all these programs may be changed to only one - LibreOffice Writer, but it significantly slower for ODT/OTT and DOCX/DOTX.\n\n", "Q: Is possible to force only Deluge to connect via PPTP?

It could be that I used Banshee long ago which was replayed by rhythmbox - I simply don't remember.\nMy question is: can anyone verify that rhythmbox does indeed play radio stations?

Instead, configure /etc/network/interfaces to have your interface configured:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nThen reload the configuration:\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nReplace eth0 with the interface name on your system of course.\nFor more information, see the manpage of interfaces.\n\nCheck with\nifconfig -a\n\nfor interfaces not up, but available on your system.\n\n\n[...] Permission denied\n\nYou got this, because you aren't running dhclient as root/sudo.

I've been looking on-line for several days now, also with no luck.  Ive even tried re-installing it but the issue still remains. I'm new to Ubuntu tho I've been using it since April and I'm now a true convert!  My greatest fear is that this is going to be something very simple and I'm going to have wasted everyones precious time.  I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) 32-bit with GNOME 3.4.2 and my version of Kmymoney is 4.6.3.  I'm happy to supply any further information required and greatly appreciate the time and effort anyone gives to what I hope turns out to be the ignorance of a novice user.\n\nA: You might have the menu disabled in KMyMoney's resource file. I had the same problem switching from Ubuntu to Kubuntu (maybe because of Unity's \"Global Menu\"?).\nLook for the resource file in your home directory:\n~/.kde/share/config/kmymoneyrc\n\nIt's a regular text file, you can open it with your preferred text editor. Just make sure KMyMoney is not running. And if you are not comfortable editing configuration files, you should make a backup first.  \nLook for any occurrences of MenuBar=Disabled (could be more than one). Replace Disabled with Enabled, so it reads MenuBar=Enabled. Save the changes, and reopen KMyMoney.\nUnfortunately I couldn't find a way to change this setting without messing directly with the file (which might lead to unexpected results/problems if not done carefully).\n", "Q: I can not install Wifi Fern?

I've heard Ubuntu 13.10 will ship Smart Scopes technology.\nWhat are smart scopes?\n\nA: Smart scopes is a technology that provides functionality to choose the best set of scopes to present to the user depending on the search term, whether the scope is locally installed or remotely available on Canonical servers.\nThe \"smartness\" is achieved by consulting Canonical's Smart Scopes Server with every search query made from the Home view of the Dash.\nThis technology will be available from Ubuntu 13.10 onwards, and it can be tested already in the Ubuntu \"Saucy Salamander\" development images, which will eventually become the 13.10 release.\nHow it all works\nThe journey starts when the user opens the Dash and types something to search for. The search query will be submitted to both local scopes in the user machine and to remote scopes in the Smart Scopes Server. You can think of scopes as dedicated search engines (e.g. the videos scope will search for videos), whose results can be combined and prioritized before they're presented to the user.\nThis is where the Smart Scopes Service kicks in: a remote service used by the Home Scope to determine the best matches for Scopes to trigger for a search term. It is also responsible for returning results of any remote scopes for that search term, as well as accepting anonymous metrics generated during that search.\nEfficient\nIn order to provide a richer variety of results, a great number of scopes will be installed on the local machine. Each one of these will be activated only if the Smart Scopes Service deems it necessary, and all scopes will be unloaded after a period of inactivity.\nThis, combined with the lion share of the work being done on the remote server provides for a very efficient and modularized process, giving the user a fast experience in getting content despite of all the processing happening behind the scenes.\nSmart!\nThe Smart Scopes Server will constantly learn about the results being clicked on the Dash according to the search terms, and adapts the returned results and their ranking based on the metrics it receives. The more the service is used and the more the Ubuntu user base grows, the more accurate the results will be.\n", "Q: Is any personal or sensitive data collected as part of the Smart Scopes Server? The Smart Scopes technology implies submitting search queries online for them to be processed by the Smart Scopes Server from Canonical.\nIs any personal or sensitive data collected as part of the Smart Scopes Server?\n\nA: The short answer is no.\nThes Smart Scopes Server collects aggregated statistics related to search queries and doesn’t collect any data to identify any user. Only the search query is stored on the server.\nUsers are not tracked in any way: there isn't a notion of anyone’s search history and queries and feedback cannot be correlated to a user. As a consequence, Smart Scopes search results are not personalized. If collecting anonymous search queries is still a concern, any scope or entire communication with Smart Scopes Server can be easily disabled via the user’s Privacy Settings dialog.\nIf a scope requires personal information to work (such as account information) then it will only be able to run on the client but never on the server.\nThe Smart Scopes spec contains information about all the data that is sent to the server.\n", "Q: Problems with apt-get update (-11 -System error) and GitHub I am having some problems when running apt-get update:\nW: Failed to fetch http://br.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/Release.gpg\nSomething wicked happened resolving 'br.archive.ubuntu.com:http' (-11 - System error)\nE: Some index files failed to download. \nThey have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nAlso, when I try to push something to GitHub I receive this error:\nerror: Couldn't resolve host 'github.com' \nwhile accessing https://github.com/lapl/HardL1.git/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack\nfatal: HTTP request failed\n\nWhen I am at University it works fine. Any help on fixing this?\n\nA: Configure your network to use another name server (DNS server) as the current one is failing to resolve the hostnames. Typically your home router has configured a DNS server which it uses to relay the DNS queries to. I can recommend using Google Public DNS services (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) to check out.\nPreferably, try to change this setting in your router. If this fails, try setting it on a host-basis. I've described this earlier in another answer (an excerpt below).\n\nI would recommend configuring your PC properly using Network Manager.\n  I'm assuming you're using DHCP on your network here (most common).\n  Then do this to perform the same as equivalent to the command you were\n  using:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Edit connections:\n\n  \n*Edit the connection profile you're using.\n\n  \n*On the IPv4 Settings tab:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Method: Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\nThis setting makes it doing a regular DHCP request for IP address configuration of your host, but it will ignore other non-mandatory\n  options like DNS servers suggested.\n  \n*DNS Servers: 8.8.8.8\n  \n*Hit Save\n\nDone.\n\n", "Q: What opportunities do scopes offer to mobile operators? Mobile phone operators are often concerned with providing a means to provide differentiation in the OS they ship, while not increasing the maintenance cost due to potential fragmentation.\nThis might be something that Ubuntu Touch can help with with the scopes technology.\nWhat are the benefits of Scopes in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Scopes provide the backend for all user searches in the Dash, which is the main entry point for most user journeys.\nAs such, scopes have a great impact on what is presented to the user in response to search queries, but also in the default view when no query is entered. Operators can implement their own scopes to add to or replace existing ones and that way influence user experience and provide differentiation to a great extent.\n", "Q: What programming languages are scopes written in? I'd like to get started writing a Scope for Ubuntu.\nWhat programming languages are available and what should I choose?\n\nA: Once upon a time, scopes had Python and Vala bindings. Python was the recommended language. This actually still applies for the desktop and Unity 7. However, while it will still be around for a bit (i.e. it's still shipped in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), we're phasing out Unity 7 in favour of Unity 8 in the new world where we'll have a single Unity codebase that runs across devices and form factors (e.g. phone and desktop).\nSo at this point, the recommendation for new projects is to write scopes for Unity 8. In Unity 8 the supported language is C++. All current tutorials and API docs are based on C++.\nThe reasons for going for C++ are twofold: performance and compatibility with the Qt APIs available throughout the platform.\nWe do recognize the value of supporting other bindings. While Go is still not on par with the C++ bindings, you can also already write scopes in Go (see the preliminary documentation) and further down the road we're also considering adding JavaScript.\n", "Q: Start ubuntu without a desktop environment but start an X application I want to do a small computer just for internet browsing. I dont want to load a desktop environment to keep RAM, CPU and GPU ussage as low as possible. The computer is going to run on a ARM CPU. I dont care with Distro I use, I thought about good old plain Debian.\n\nA: *\n\n*In /usr/share/xsessions/ create a file in the \".desktop\" format to create your custom, minimal session. For running Google Chrome as the only application after logging in, do this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=google-chrome\nName=Google Chrome\nComment=Testing\n\n\n*Restart your display manager, e.g.\nsudo restart lightdm  # or kdm, gdm, etc.\n\nOr simply log out.\n\n*\"Google Chrome\" should appear in the session list to select (next to regular Unity or other DEs you have installed).\nLog in and enjoy.\noptional\n\n\n*\n\n*XDM is a very minimal display manager - LightDM, GDM and KDM are quite \"big\". Install that using the package xdm  and reconfigure the default for when your system boots up using\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\n\n*Configure your display manager to automatically log in a specific user. See the documentation for your display manager.\n\nA: I know this one is outdated, but I couldn't see the correct answer for the request as I understand it, so here it goes:\nI've had a project for creating an embedded system running a specific graphical java application on a simple computer with an Atom processor and a touch screen. My decision was to avoid the use of window managers as such, to keep it a) simple, b) light, and c) avoid all kind of system messages bursting to the screen.\nThe system looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the base Ubuntu system, lightest variant of 12.04 (still close to 1GB, but ok for me even on a 2GB flash disk). You can torture it a bit to make a smaller installation, of course, there are several ways for that. Also, you don't have to use Ubuntu, but then my instructions below should be reviewed - there are differences between distributions, especially on configuration files and their locations.\n\n*Installing the xorg and some other nice pieces of helpful software, like the xinput-calibrator for my resistive touchscreen, ifplugd for live ethernet connection detection, acpid for power button operation detection and so on.\n\n*Open /etc/init/tty1.conf and change exec /sbin/getty -8 -i 38400 tty1 line to something like exec /sbin/getty -8 -i 38400 tty1 -a username, where \"username\" is the name of the user you want to auto-login.\n\n*To start the X session automatically, open your user's .bashrc file ~/.bashrc and add something like this to the end of the file:\nif [ $(tty) == \"/dev/tty1\" ]; then\n    while true; do startx -- -nocursor -depth 16; echo \"Again [$?]...\"; done\nfi\n\n(The -nocursor stuff is for touchscreens, remove it for normal screen to see the mouse pointer)\nThis will respawn the X server, so if your application quits for any reason, it will restart the X server automatically.\n\n*Now in your user's .xsession file, ~/.xsession, write something like this (remember that each command here is executed in series, so use the & symbol at the end of the line if you want to launch a server):\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 800x600      #For setting a video mode\nxrandr --fb 800x600                      #Not always required, sets the framebuffer size\nxsetbg -center background.png &          #To set the background, comes from the xloadimage package\nxset -dpms s off                         #To avoid screen going blank after a while\n~username/start.sh                       #Start your application\n#You can put some other application calls here that will be run when your application exits\n\nThere are plenty of other things to consider for such a system, this is only the basic setup. Hope it helps someone. Good luck.\n\nA: In the olden days, you could just run X, and X would fire up with a blank screen. Then you could set DISPLAY=:0 and run something there. Perhaps this still works? From a shell you'll want X& to background it.\nLook into the -geometry standard X command line parameter to adjust the placement of the window, since you won't have a window manager to help you with that.\nTo run something as non-root, you'll need to look into xauth to set up X authorization for the non-root user.\n\nA: (My reputation is too low to comment.\n--> I used the solution posted by @gertvdijk and experienced the same problem as @tumbudu)\nIf you don't have access to google chrome (Alpine Linux), the firefox package lets you pass the screen resolution that the app should open with as parameters:\nfirefox -height 1920 -width 1080\n\n", "Q: How do I debug my Unity Scope? I've started writing a scope for the Unity Dash, but it seems not to return results.\nI'd like to find out why: how can I debug my scope?\n\nA: Scopes are normally activated by DBus, which makes them a bit trickier to debug. But at the same time they’re normal processes and can be run manually so that any warnings or debug statements are easily visible.\nThe recommendation is to start your scope manually from the command line and use the traditional debugging tools, such as gdb, valgrind, strace etc. Since scopes use DBus for internal IPC, a DBus monitor tool (such as Bustle) can be handy if you suspect any problems in this area.\n\nYou can also use the libunity-tool debugger, simply executing it's GUI from the command line libunity-tool -g. Just execute your scope manually or from the Dash, find the DBus path in the initial drop-down box, submit a search query and watch the results.\n", "Q: Where is the contacts folder?

You can install them from the Ubuntu Software Center. Search for \"fglrx\" and install the package. After a reboot graphics should be better.\nAs MiJyn commented below, it is necessary to run sudo amdconfig --initial -f after installation.

Please know there won't be a huge volume of data to be downloaded as most part of the system is already there, only specific packages will be downloaded.\nYou can get XFCE/Xubuntu or LXDE/Lubuntu easily by running sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop or sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop in a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T).\nAfter that, logout and login back in, and remember to change the session from Ubuntu to Xubuntu/Lubuntu at the login screen.\nGood luck and let us know if this works!\n", "Q: Data lost after installing ubuntu. Any chance of recovery? while upgrading from ubuntu 12.04 to 13.04\nand i used those default options \"delete ubuntu and install\"\nbut unfortunately all my other partitions also got deleted\nand they got combined into one\nin which ubuntu is installed\nis there anyway to recover data?\n\nA: There are good chances to recover the whole previous partitions if you stop working on your hard disk drive IMMEDIATELY. The longer you use the hard disk, the more risk your data is exposed to.\nI suggest you to take a look at this answer.\nAditionally, as suggested by @Private, run a search for \"data recovery\" in this site and I am sure you'll find a lot of useful answers.\nIn your case, and considering that you have already write a lot of clusters, you may experience some data loss (which may be a big amount of data). And maybe you'll be in need to first remove your current partitions (by formatting the whole disk NOT THE PARTITIONS but the disk itself) in order to recover the previous. These tasks can be done with a simple Ubuntu Live CD and installing the required tools (GParted, testdisk, etc.) or a GParted Live CD/USB \nI hope you find a way to bring your data back with these information but if you need further support don't hesitate to drop a comment.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Can software for Ubuntu Desktop work on Ubuntu touch unmodified? I have software that works on Ubuntu 12.10 Desktop. Would it run also on Ubuntu Touch?\nSpecifically, I'm trying to use OpenCFU on a Ubuntu tablet. I just want to know if it would work; whether it would be able to satisfy all the dependencies like GTK etc. using the terminal.\n\nA: The short answer is: No.\nThe long answer is: Yes, if the app was written in Qt 5 or HTML, and was capable of running on the limit screen size and interacting with touch input and on-screen-keyboard, then it would run.  But most apps written originally for the desktop won't meet that criteria.\nThe even longer answer is: This is why we developed the Ubuntu SDK, it's a toolkit designed to allow apps to be developed for desktops, phones and tablets (and TVs).  It has resolution-independence built it, it support multiple display servers already, and it's being designed to adapt appropriately between touch and keyboard/mouse inputs.  Eventually we hope that the majority of Ubuntu's apps will work seemlessly across all of our supported form factors, and the Ubuntu SDK is how we plan to get there.\n", "Q: wordpress mysql physical files .MYD not in /var/lib/mysql/dbname I installed wordpress on my home server (multisite install + varnish cache).\nNow I'm looking into /var/lib/mysql/dbname to recover the mysql files, and here is what I find : All the important tables doesn't have the .MYD !!! \ndb.opt                           wp_easymail_stats.frm\nwp_2_commentmeta.frm             wp_easymail_subscribers.frm\nwp_2_comments.frm                wp_easymail_unsubscribed.frm\nwp_2_easymail_recipients.frm     wp_gsom_subscribers.frm\nwp_2_easymail_stats.frm          wp_links.frm\nwp_2_easymail_subscribers.frm    wp_newsman_email_templates.frm\nwp_2_easymail_unsubscribed.frm   wp_newsman_lists.frm\nwp_2_links.frm                   wp_newsman_lst_default.frm\nwp_2_ngg_album.frm               wp_ngg_album.frm\nwp_2_ngg_gallery.frm             wp_nggcf_fields.frm\nwp_2_ngg_pictures.frm            wp_nggcf_fields_link.frm\nwp_2_options.frm                 wp_nggcf_field_values.frm\nwp_2_postmeta.frm                wp_ngg_gallery.frm\nwp_2_posts.frm                   wp_ngg_pictures.frm\nwp_2_subscribe2.frm              wp_options.frm\nwp_2_term_relationships.frm      wp_postmeta.frm\nwp_2_terms.frm                   wp_posts.frm\nwp_2_term_taxonomy.frm           wp_registration_log.frm\nwp_2_wysija_campaign.frm         wp_signups.frm\nwp_2_wysija_campaign_list.frm    wp_site.frm\nwp_2_wysija_campaign_list.MYD    wp_sitemeta.frm\nwp_2_wysija_campaign_list.MYI    wp_term_relationships.frm\nwp_2_wysija_campaign.MYD         wp_terms.frm\nwp_2_wysija_campaign.MYI         wp_term_taxonomy.frm\nwp_2_wysija_email.frm            wp_usermeta.frm\nwp_2_wysija_email.MYD            wp_users.frm\nwp_2_wysija_email.MYI            wp_wysija_campaign.frm\nwp_2_wysija_email_user_stat.frm  wp_wysija_campaign_list.frm\nwp_2_wysija_email_user_stat.MYD  wp_wysija_campaign_list.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_email_user_stat.MYI  wp_wysija_campaign_list.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_email_user_url.frm   wp_wysija_campaign.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_email_user_url.MYD   wp_wysija_campaign.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_email_user_url.MYI   wp_wysija_email.frm\nwp_2_wysija_form.frm             wp_wysija_email.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_form.MYD             wp_wysija_email.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_form.MYI             wp_wysija_email_user_stat.frm\nwp_2_wysija_list.frm             wp_wysija_email_user_stat.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_list.MYD             wp_wysija_email_user_stat.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_list.MYI             wp_wysija_email_user_url.frm\nwp_2_wysija_queue.frm            wp_wysija_email_user_url.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_queue.MYD            wp_wysija_email_user_url.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_queue.MYI            wp_wysija_form.frm\nwp_2_wysija_url.frm              wp_wysija_form.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_url_mail.frm         wp_wysija_form.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_url_mail.MYD         wp_wysija_list.frm\nwp_2_wysija_url_mail.MYI         wp_wysija_list.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_url.MYI              wp_wysija_queue.frm\nwp_2_wysija_user_field.frm       wp_wysija_queue.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_user_field.MYD       wp_wysija_queue.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_user_field.MYI       wp_wysija_url.frm\nwp_2_wysija_user.frm             wp_wysija_url_mail.frm\nwp_2_wysija_user_history.frm     wp_wysija_url_mail.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_user_history.MYD     wp_wysija_url_mail.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_user_history.MYI     wp_wysija_url.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_user_list.frm        wp_wysija_url.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_user_list.MYD        wp_wysija_user_field.frm\nwp_2_wysija_user_list.MYI        wp_wysija_user_field.MYD\nwp_2_wysija_user.MYD             wp_wysija_user_field.MYI\nwp_2_wysija_user.MYI             wp_wysija_user.frm\nwp_blogs.frm                     wp_wysija_user_history.frm\nwp_blog_versions.frm             wp_wysija_user_history.MYD\nwp_commentmeta.frm               wp_wysija_user_history.MYI\nwp_comments.frm                  wp_wysija_user_list.frm\nwp_domain_mapping.frm            wp_wysija_user_list.MYD\nwp_domain_mapping_logins.frm     wp_wysija_user_list.MYI\nwp_ean_newsletter.frm            wp_wysija_user.MYD\nwp_easymail_recipients.frm       wp_wysija_user.MYI\n\nDo you have an idea from where I could recover these .MYD files ?

Make sure you install tomcat7-admin too using sudo apt-get install tomcat7-admin\nRun the command below to check the same.\nwhereis tomcat7\n\nAnd before you add a server in Eclipse ensure to run the following commands, the tomcat server in eclipse expects to have these files and folders in their respective locations for working correctly.\ncd /usr/share/tomcat7\nsudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/conf conf\nsudo ln -s /etc/tomcat7/policy.d/03catalina.policy conf/catalina.policy\nsudo ln -s /var/log/tomcat7 log\nsudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/tomcat7/conf\nsudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/common common\nsudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/server server\nsudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/shared shared\n\nIf you are going to solely use Eclipse to start and stop tomcat server then remove the tomcat7 from the startup script to disable it from starting automatically everytime the machine boots up.\nsudo service tomcat7 stop\nsudo update-rc.d tomcat7 disable\n\nNow open the Java EE perspective in your Eclipse.

I need to update it based on having actually tried using Tomcat 7. See Cannot start tomcat after installing a private instance.\nAll software is different, obviously, but in general packaged software is quicker and easier to install than zipped distributions. It allows you to configure, start, and stop services in a fairly standard way, and if you run Ubuntu on your production environment it allows you to run consistent versions to minimise compatibility issues. It also allows you to receive security updates automatically.\nFor Tomcat, it is pretty easy to download the zip distribution, unpack, and point Eclipse at it. However, if you want to keep it updated you'll need to manage that yourself. If you install the packaged version, you'll get updates automatically.\nWhen using Tomcat for development, there are a few problems with installing the tomcat7 package because it is intended to be run as a background service owned by the tomcat7 user:\n\n\n*\n\n*The installation directories and files are not set up in the way that Eclipse expects; they are split into two locations.\n\n*When you run Tomcat from Eclipse it won't have permissions to write to the places it wants to because the files are not owned by your user.\n\n*Using sudo update-rc.d tomcat7 disable to prevent the service from starting is not persistent across updates, so if the tomcat7 package gets updated then it'll start up automatically next time you boot.\n\n\nHowever, if you only want Tomcat installed for development, and you do not want to run it as a service in the background all the time, there is better alternative for this exact purpose; there is a package specifically for creating private instances. This way, you get the benefit of a packaged distribution, but without the disadvantages of battling with a configuration that is designed to be run as a service.\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall tomcat7 and install the tomcat7-user package instead:\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7-user\n\n*Create your own private instance somewhere in your home directory:\ntomcat7-instance-create ~/my-instance\n\n*Configure your Eclipse project to use the Tomcat installation in the location you just created above.\nNow you can start and stop your own private instance of Tomcat from within your Eclipse project.\nTL;DR\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't install tomcat7 for development, use tomcat7-user instead.\n\n*Download the zip distribution if you're a traditionalist or like doing things the hard way.\n\n\nA: In my experience you should only use the officially packaged components for production use.  For development I would recommend getting the bits you need directly from the net and install them where you need it.\nThen when you are done developing, deploy to the officially packaged Tomcat.\n", "Q: Minetest won't install Every time I try to install Minetest from a .deb package, it says this afert \n\nprocessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nerrors were encountered while processing: /home/collinc/downloads/minetestc55_0.4.7-0ppal~raring1_i386.deb\n\nI need 0.4.7, not 0.3.1 like they have in the software center.

Can I delete my Windows 7 software, as well as any old files that Linux doesn't require to run? I'm new to Linux.\nIf I can, where/how do I delete it?\n\nA: Linux is significantly more efficient than Windows. If you are really concerned about speed, try messing with your startup applications.\nLinux primarily uses the ext3 or ext4 file system, which unlike NTFS, does not need defragmentation. So your computer won't slow down over time because of file fragmentation on the HDD. The Linux filesystem is more intelligent than that. :)\nIf you are new to Linux, I would recommend Linux Mint over Ubuntu.\n", "Q: replace ubuntu with windows 7 I am running Ubuntu 13.04 right now and i would like to go back to windows.

I am looking for a way to get my computer to automatically shutdown when I press the power button. I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 minimal. A similar question is asked here. However, with Ubuntu Minimal, I do not have the /etc/acpi/ directory, most likely because ACPI does not come installed by default?\nIs there a way to shutdown the computer nicely via the power button without the use of ACPI? Or do I have no choice but to install it?\n\nA: ACPI is the actual system responsible for handling such power related tasks. Without ACPI support (either software or hardware), you won't be able to listen to the power button event.\nFor Ubuntu installing the acpid  package should be sufficient. This provides the event daemon listening for events such as pressing a power button. It is installed on regular Ubuntu versions, but as you've installed a minimal version, it was omitted.\nOn a minimal/server installation, the installation can be performed on the command line like any other package:\nsudo apt-get install acpid\n\n\nA: ACPI is what you want. I'll direct you to this post:\nHow can I enable the power button on my server?\nAnd here is an example of manipulating the ACPI options\nhttp://test.z13media.com/2010/03/disable-power-button-on-ubuntu-server.html\n", "Q: Last couple of fglrx drivers on Ubuntu 12.04 have backlight support broken I've been keeping up with latest fglrx releases on AMD's website and it appears that both the last stable (13.4) and beta (13.6) drivers have brightness broken in Ubuntu 12.04 with all the latest updates. Hardware/software configuration is HP dm1 4000 series laptop (more specifically dm1-4142nr) with an AMD6320 APU running 64-bit version of Ubuntu 12.04. All display options and desktop features work just fine.\nPressing hardware brightness keys brings up Unity's pop-up brightness bar which changes accordingly but there are no changes to the actual backlight brightness.\nDoing echo 5 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness as root does nothing either even though the actual number sticks and both brightness and actual_brightness reflect the newly echoed number (any other number does the same).\nTrying to boot the kernel with acpi_backlight=vendor flag has no effect. Neither does adding the following in the xorg.conf (under Section \"device\"):\nOption      \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\nAdjusting brightness within the amdccle tool changes brightness by adjusting colors but does not change the actual backlight amount (or at least it does not appear to). There are no other options pertaining to brightness that I could find.\nAt this point I am all but out of ideas as it seems this is clearly driver's fault. Is there a way to figure out where in the driver source is the regression so that one can at least revert that part and build a fully working driver with latest improvements?\nEdit: further clarifications and additional questions\nI also tried 12.100, 12.104, and 13.101 and none of them work in terms of brightness. diff between 9.012 sources (that work but have other 3D bugs) and 12 and newer branches shows only versioning difference so it appears that brightness control is buried within the binary blob. Using acpi_os_name=\"Windows 2009\" acpi_osi=\"Windows 2009\" ironically enables brightness adjustments until you enter the X part of the boot sequence at which point it stops working.\nAt this point, I am wondering if anyone else has backlight working on these newer drivers and what their kernel boot options are.\nSept. 8th UPDATE:\nTried 8/19/2013 driver and no change--if anything manual spam of brightness change reported on one of the forums works even more sporadically. I guess I am wondering at this point if this is possibly a kernel issue and if so, do any of the users of newer versions of Ubuntu (12.10, 13.04, etc.) have the same issue?\nJan. 12th, 2014 UPDATE:\nAs indicated in comments below, all versions released since still haven't fixed this problem. The most recent stable release (13.12) and its predecessor enable brightness changing until one suspends the computer and upon resuming brightness adjustment stops working until either computer or X server is restarted.\nI also just tried latest beta which apparently is misnumbered (13.11-betav9.95 released on 01/08/2014), and the same problem persists... Gotta love AMD driver support...\nUpdate Jan 20, 2014: version 13.30.rc3 (beta) same problem... I have a nagging suspicion that the AMD team does not have anyone competent to tackle Linux issues like problems of reliable suspend/resume or the aforesaid brightness regression, both of which have existed for ages and instead they just backport basic things from the Windows driver to make it \"work\" with the new hardware. This is definitely the last AMD investment I will ever make...\nUpdate Feb. 3, 2014: 14.1 beta is released and it lists fixing brightness on the Ubuntu 12.04 as one of its bugfixes. This however is not the case, and the brightness stops functioning after resume.\nUpdate Mar. 22, 2014: 14.2 and 14.3 betas make no improvement on this either.\n\nA: After a day of investigation, it turns out this problem is apparently just as rampant (see open&product=&content=backlight\">http://ati.cchtml.com/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=open&product=&content=backlight) as intermittent resume freeze after suspend when using fglrx module (as opposed to the proprietary driver). For the time being any driver above 9.012 doesn't have backlight support working. As of June 2013, the only workaround (see https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1269560#p1269560) for drivers newer than 9.012 is to press hardware brightness buttons and hold them for several seconds. This will usually cycle between brightest and darkest setting (depending on which button you're holding) which should be ok enough to use the laptop in a way that allows some battery life optimization/autonomy when away from AC but it is also an ugly hack. I guess we will have to wait until AMD releases next version (13.6 beta is also affected) of the driver and hopefully fixes the regression.\nFor the time being, I will not pick this as my answer in hope someone may come up with a better solution.\n\nA: The latest beta driver 13.8 (driver packaging version 13.20.11-130814a-161038E-ATI) appears to fix this issue.  Download at http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx\n\nA: I had this problem with an ASUS X54H machine (ATI graphics card).\nAfter installing the proprietary drivers, the backlight is off from the login screen. Deactivating it makes the backlight to be on again but in between I had to try those fixes related to the GRUB cfg, which don't work in this case.\nSo for those who have installed these drivers in an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I would suggest deactivate them through the system settings (you could use the VGA output of your laptop) if the GRUB changes related to acpi_osi=Linux and acpi_backlight=vendor don't work.\n\nA: It appears that the latest beta released on Sept. 30th, 2013 (version 13.10) has partially fixed the problem for me. See http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx for more info.\nThe driver still fails to update brightness once the system is suspended and then resumed. Has anyone had any luck with this?\nAnother update, 13.11-beta6 has the same limitation as 13.10.\nAnd yet another update, 13.12 stable release has the same limitation... So do all the releases since, including 14.1.\n\nA: So, finally with the release of 14.6beta, the brightness problem has been silently fixed so that even after resume brightness adjustment continues to work... There is no mention of it in the changelog.\nYou can get the 64-bit beta version from:\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Linux%20x86_64#amd-catalyst-packages\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu on my Laptop I am using a Sony Vaio SVE15113EN (E Series) laptop with i3-2370M CPU @2.40GHz (64bit processor) and 2 GB ram.

I think this is directly related to the xrandr:  Configure crtc 2 failed.\nDepending on the configuration I get many different CRTC errors on bootup.  147,148,149 seem the most common.\ncurrent xrandr -q shows the following\n$ xrandr-q\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 4096 x 1152, maximum 6016 x 2048\nLVDS connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n   1920x1080      60.0 +\n   ...\nDFP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP4 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP5 connected 2048x1152+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 510mm x 287mm\n   2048x1152      59.9*+\n   ...\nDFP6 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP7 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP8 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP9 connected 2048x1152+2048+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 510mm x 287mm\n   2048x1152      59.9*+\n   ...\nDFP10 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP11 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDFP12 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nCRT1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nThis basically confirms my virtual screen size is large enough, and the displays are available.\n\nA: 3D support for the Radeon HD 7000 series in the radeon driver is finally available when combining the Linux 3.9 kernel, Mesa 9.2 and LLVM 3.3.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for the release of Ubuntu 13.10 \"Saucy Salamander\" on 17th October 2013.  It currently has the 3.10 kernel and might even update to the 3.11 kernel.  They are also planning to pull Mesa 9.2 (currently scheduled for release on 22nd August 2013) into Ubuntu 13.10 - you can monitor that at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mesa\n\n*Install a 3.9 or 3.10 kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nInstructions on how to install and uninstall it are available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds\nNote that this is more likely to be successful on Ubuntu 13.04 than on earlier Ubuntu versions.  Then install the xorg-edgers PPA to get Mesa 9.2-devel.\nP.S.: The xorg-edgers PPA is available at at https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 DisplayLink Adapter No Green Screen I initially wanted to get this working on 13.04, but have since given up.  If I get it working on 12.10, I may decide to upgrade, but that's irrelevant until such a time.\nUnlike many reported cases of the combination of Ubuntu and the adapter not working, mine does not display anything on the monitor, least of all green. After a few days of frustrating searching, and failed attempts to build xserver-xorg-video-displaylink after discovering it isn't available from the repository anymore, I stumbled across bug 812594 on launchpad for xserver-xorg-video-displaylink.\nWhile the title was not encouraging, I looked through the comments anyway, and discovered Damiön's comment regarding Canonical Paid support.  The included README was highly illuminating, and decided to look at the ATTR{name} entry from udevadm info --attribute-walk --path=$(udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/fb1).  Surprisingly, it returned \"udldrmfb,\" not an identifier I'd found before.  A quick search came up with a number of bugs concerning EDID extension blocks, which matched with my vague understanding from the read-edid package output.\nThat's about as far as I've gotten, and I'm rather stumped.  How can I get this adapter working?\n\nA: As it turns out, the adapter will not be recognized by the driver unless you plug in the adapter after initial startup.  For me, that means plugging it in at the logon screen.\n", "Q: How to make Ubuntu Alt+Tab smarter? Alt+Tab is frequently used to switch windows under which a user is working parallel. But the more I use Alt+Tab under Ubuntu, the less I feel Ubuntu is smart. For example, when I am working in window A, I want to switch to window B, but most of the time ubuntu switch to another window C that I don't want to go to.\nThe question I want to ask is, is there a tool that can make Alt+Tab behaviour smarter? \nMy basic idea to make Alt+Tab smarter is that, the switching process can be modelled as a Markov process. That is using P_ij to represent the probability of switching from window i to window j. This matrix can be updated while I am working. A smarter Alt+Tab should be able to guess which window I want to go to according to this matrix. \nHowever, I am idiot on programming to change this behaviour. Can you do it?\n\nA: I like your idea, but with the speed at which you open and close applications, a Markov chain might fail to keep up or create unecessary overhead. That being said, if you want to contribute I suggest reading here: Giving Ideas and Feedback. You don't need to program anything, but you do need to give it to the correct people who can. \nThis isn't the place, but I like where you are going with it.\n", "Q: HDD and SSD configuration I had just bought a system76 laptop that is preinstalled with Ubuntu 13.04, and has a nice SSD and HDD setup. The problem is that the laptop's hdd comes unpartioned and unformatted, while the entire filesytem lives on the SSD. It is a very high-end laptop, and God forbid that anything happens to the SSD. Every article I look up in my research says that you must be going on a safari in your fstab and partitioning your SSD and HDD for certain file directories.\nIn short, I have to ask, is it okay to just mount the /home directory in the HDD, while the rest of the file system lives in the SSD? Does it really make a difference if you're coming from a 2011 MacBook Pro with a 5400 RPM hard drive, or if the SSD tech is fairly modern?\nMy SSD specs are:\n120 GB Intel 525 Series mSATA SSD,\nAnd my HDD specs are:\n500 GB 7200 RPM SATA II\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: I have heard of people running their system on one drive and their /home directory on another. As long as it's configured correctly and both drives are always available this is a viable thing to do.\n", "Q: Kernel dump using linux-crashdump under VMware? I've followed the directions here on the Ubuntu help wiki for my 12.04.2 Ubuntu Server running in VMware Fusion 5, and everything looks good, so I do a echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger as root. It panics the kernel as expected, and then hangs after printing out a bunch of stack traces. \nI waited a few minutes to make sure any writes to disk (for the crash dump) finished, and I restarted the VM. When I log in again, ls /var/crash shows no files! Any idea how to get it to work, or whether it works at all?\n\nA: The reason why this doesn't work properly has been well documented for over three or so years now: see this page of the Ubuntu wiki\n\nOn systems with <= 2G RAM we won't reserve enough memory for the crash kernel's initrd to fit. That will cause the crash-kernel to panic.\n\nSee also these bug reports for reference #785394 and #1235616\nWorkaround:\nTo fix this issue set\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"crashkernel=128M\"\n\nin /etc/default/grub. n.b.: You cannot put this option into GRUB_CMDLINE_DEFAULT, because the the setting in /etc/grub.d/10_linux takes precedence over that.\nTo \"permanently\" fix the issue, edit `/etc/grub.d/10_linux and change the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_EXTRA=\"$GRUB_CMDLINE_EXTRA crashkernel=384M-2G:64M,2G-:128M\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_EXTRA=\"$GRUB_CMDLINE_EXTRA crashkernel=128M\"\n\n\nA: The problem might be your RAM is too low.

I've got a windows machine and recently decided to add a second hard drive with Xubuntu to run a dual-boot setup. I already have Adobe Master Collection CS 6 installed on my windows HD. Is there a way for me to run CS 6 applications in Xubuntu, from where they currently reside on the other HD? The entire Win7 HD is accessible to browse in Xubuntu. \n\nA: No you can't just re run the installed exe from that location.\nYou need to install them in linux again. You can take help of wine. \nThough there is several restriction and the product may not run correctly to full extent.\nPlease see http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=category&iId=29&sAction=view&sTitle=Browse+Applications for know the compatibility.\nRelated question : Is it possible to run adobe master collection cs6 in ubuntu \n\nA: Maybe the best way to do this is using Wine. And you have most of the work done because most of the bugs appear during the installation. Once you have the program ready to run it's only a matter of getting the configuration right... \nYou can install wine just by running:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\n(replace apt-get with aptitude if needed, I don't remember the package manager of Xubuntu)\nHere is the official documentation of Wine Database: \nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=25607 \nNote: the documentation says it's only been tested on Ubuntu 12.10 Kubuntu and some older version but I don't think there will be any difference.\nOnce you configured it as the documentation says just go to the main .exe (the one that you 'd use to launch it on windows), right click it and select \"Open with Wine\". This should start the program.\nI have tested this with several programs and it works fine\nAlso you may need to install some .dll files. You can use winetricks for this\nsudo apt-get install winetricks\n\nTo use this you can run the .exe file from the terminal to see the error that it may display. To do this you can enter this command:\nwine /route/Program.exe\n\nOr you can cd to route and run:\nwine Program.exe\n\nGoogle the name of the dll and once you 've found the library for winetricks you can do:\nwinetricks dlls dll_name\n\nReplacing dll_name for the name of the dll found.\nFinally you can use the command\nwinecfg\n\nTo set up the details of wine configuration in a more friendly enviroment.\nHope this was useful and sorry about my english :D\nEdit:\nI 've also found some issues with the License but I can run any program that doesn't need a license. Maybe you should install all CS6 again using wine (in my personal experience this usually brings lots of bugs).\nSadly I have no programs with original license to try this out.\n", "Q: what is \"yourDomainName.ca-bundle\"? for installing ssl certificate on ubuntu i have to insert these lines on virtualHost block:\nSSLEngine on\nSSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/ssl.key/server.key\nSSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/ssl.crt/yourDomainName.crt\nSSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/ssl.crt/yourDomainName.ca-bundle\n\nbut i don't understand what the forth line does?\n\nA: With certificates you are dealing with what you may call a \"chain of trust\". It's kind of \"Adam says it's raining outside. I believe Adam because Bob said Adam's trustworthy. I believe Bob because Christine says Bob's trustworthy\" and so on and so forth.\nA certificate is used, among other things like encryption, as a kind of ID badge: This website proclaims to be your-website.com, and it can show the certificate to prove it. But why to trust the certificate? Because it has been issued by an instance that is trusted itself, a so called certification authority (CA). This CA is operated by the company you bought your certificate from. But why to trust this CA? Because it can show a certificate that is trustworthy. That second certificate is issued from a \"higher up\" CA. This \"higher up\" CA has a certificate that it is trustworthy from still another CA, and so on. This goes on and on until you reach a \"root certificate\".\nThose root certificates are delivered with your web browser, mail client or other client that needs to assess a certificate. If your browser is presented a certificate, it checks whether it matches the site that uses it (domain name and such), and whether it trusts the CA that issued the certificate. The CA is trusted if the \"higher up\" CA that certified this CA is trusted, and so on. By this method, your browser should arrive at one point at one of its root certificates. If it does, the browser accepts the certificate we started out with. If it can't build a chain of trust back to a root certificate, it doesn't accept the certificate (or warns you about it, depending on your settings).\nAs you see, not every CA gains its trust directly from a root certificate, there can be one or many intermediate steps. Those \"intermediate certificates\", so to speak, can be stored into a file, like your certificate and the corresponding key can. And the Apache directive SSLCACertificateFile tells where to look for that file. You should recieve those \"intermediate certificates\" along with your certificate, or they should be available from the company you bought your certificate from.\n", "Q: No Audio Sound, Dummy output the only option in sound configurations I have no Audio sound, neither in speaker nor in headphones, i used to work on 12.10 but after this problem started i upgraded to 13.04 in hope that it may be solved, but it didn't.\nWhen i open sound configurations, the only option listed there is Dummy output, so i can't change it to any other option.

Because each time I run ./configure to prepare gearmand it keeps telling me that it needs Boost headers version >= 1.39. I don't know why it doesn't find the headers, since the /usr/includes/boost/ directory exists.\nWhat am I missing ?\n\nA: To fulfil all build dependencies, my approach is always to start out asking APT to install them for the version which is in the repositories. Here's how:\nsudo apt-get build-dep gearman-job-server\n\nThis may install some packages you have overlooked, but it might not install the dependencies if the version you're trying to compile from source has different requirements. I suspect you are just missing packages like libboost-thread-dev and libboost-program-options-dev, which the above command will take care of.\nThe version of Boost in all supported Ubuntu versions is perfectly fine for your requirement of version 1.39 and up.\n\nA: Boost provides free portable peer-reviewed C++ libraries. The emphasis is on portable libraries which work well with the C++ Standard Library.\nTo download boost Version 1.53.0 with complete libraries visit Version 1.53.0.  \nBoost 1.39.0 comes with these new Libraries: Signals2. Updated Libraries: Asio, Flyweight, Foreach, Hash, Interprocess, Intrusive, Program.Options, Proto, PtrContainer, Range, Unordered, Xpressive. Updated Tools: Boostbook, Quickbook. \nOr you can install Gearmand by, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gearman-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gearman-job-server\n\nThis will install needed libraries.\nSource:Boost\n", "Q: How to replace the background image in the default plymouth theme Is it possible to replace the pink purple colour of Ubuntu's default plymouth theme with an image?\n\nA: It is!\nIf you Google search \"Plymouth Themes\" you will find an assortment of themes you can install and modify to your liking.\nIf your serious about it, you could also look into Plymouth scripting and building your own themes.\n", "Q: Unable to boot Windows after installing Ubuntu 12.10 I have just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my PC and the installation completed well.\nBut now the problem is I am unable to boot Windows 8, in GRUB menu it shows both options, If I choose Ubuntu, it boots smoothly and if I choose Windows 8 it shows the following message: \nerror: device format \"ldm/958e9087-d9d5-11e2-be71-0024d7280798/Volume1\" invalid : must be (f|h) dN, with 0<= N < 128  \n\npress any key to continue...\n\nand after some seconds...  it shows :\nA disk read error\nPress Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart.\n\nA: *\n\n*Disable SecureBoot in your BIOS ( see this paragraph )\n\n*Run Boot-Repair's Recommended Repair\n\n*Reboot, you should be able to access both Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n", "Q: Broadband gets connected but can't browse anything further google!

I want to add my Skype account to Empathy to chat with all my contacts from there. I tried the following to integrate Skype with Empathy on Ubuntu 13.04, using this tutorial from Ubuntuusers.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install pidgin-skype\n\n*Restart empathy\n\n*empathy-accounts\n\n\nBut in empathy-accounts, which loads very slow, I don't see Skype to select.\nHow can I integrate Skype with Empathy on Ubuntu 13.04?\n\n\nA: I don't use Empathy, but try this.  Install Skype for Pidgin plugin from the Ubuntu Software Center.  Open Skype and log in, and add your Skype account to Empathy protocol named ‘bigbrownchunx-skype-dbus’ or Pidgin Accounts --> Skype DBUS .  You will need to allow Empathy/Pidgin access to Skype. Source:J.Sneddon \n\nThis protocol plugin allows libpurple to communicate with Skype.\n  Applications using libpurple (Pidgin, Finch, Empathy/Telepathy, etc.)\n  can thus show your Skype contacts alongside those from other\n  protocols, and you can communicate with them using that application\n  instead of the Skype user interface.\nThis plugin communicates with the Skype application in the background\n  to perform its work, so it's necessary to have Skype installed and\n  running. This product uses the Skype API but is not endorsed,\n  certified or otherwise approved in any way by Skype. Source:USC\n\nOR\nSkype-Wrapper is a small third-party ‘plugin’ that integrates many of Skype’s features directly into the Ubuntu desktop. This includes support for Ubuntu’s Messaging Menu, notification system and Unity launcher. Source:J.Sneddon\nTo install, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:skype-wrapper/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install skype-wrapper python-skype\n\n\nA: Run JabberSkype on your Ubuntu PC and then connect Empathy to localhost with a Jabber account.\n\nA: This WILL NOT work without regular Skype client running in your desktop. The haze module just connects with that client, not with the skype server.\n\nA: You're right about using pidgin-skype, but you also need telepathy-haze. Try running sudo apt-get install telepathy-haze and restarting Empathy. That should be able to integrate Skype into Empathy.

This was set up as SW RAID. The motherboard's HW RAID is disabled.\nToday, I upgraded from 11.10 to 13.04 using a live CD. I chose the option of upgrading the existing 11.10 and retaining user data. At first, I could not boot after the upgrade. I suspected that the install had failed to update grub properly on sdc, so I first attempted to repair it by booting from the live CD and installing and using boot-repair. This was unable to complete for some unclear reason, so I instead reinstalled grub on sdc manually as described here: http://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/. After this, Ubuntu 13.04 booted to a text-based login prompt that would not accept the user name and password that I specified during install.\nI then installed 13.04 from the live CD again, this time choosing to the \"upgrade\" the now existing 13.04 install to 13.04 (again, the option with retaining user files etc.).

It may have then mounted the array as RAID0, spanning the entire disks /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, and thereby overwritten meta data about the actual SW RAID1 array that spanned the two ~700GB partitions.\n", "Q: Synaptic Package manager problem I am trying to install ubiquity-frontend-gtk through Synaptic Package manager but getting following error.

Always looking for tutos and stuff..\nSo I decided to Dualboot with with windows, turns out It's also a bit complicated. And seeing that I don't have much space left on my hard drive, I'd rather completely Uninstall Ubuntu and Install W7.\nCan I get a step-by-step tuto please? \nThanks! :)\n\nA: Just don't do it.\nJust learn how to use Ubuntu and you will love it. If you had used Ubuntu all your life and you addicently bought a Windows laptop, you would have been struggling with Windows too. Again: Learn how to use Ubuntu and you will love it.\nBut if you don't want to learn how to use Ubuntu, you could consider installing Kubuntu. Kubuntu is a version of Ubuntu that works more like Windows. It is very easy to install. Just download it, burn it to a DVD as described here, and start up from it. Then just follow the instructions. The installation is really straightforward.\nJust a few of the reasons you'll love Ubuntu/Kubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Almost no viruses\n\n*Windows is very expensive, Ubuntu is free\n\n*You will get free updates, forever. If you use Windows, Microsoft will force you to pay (Most of the time more than €100!) for an upgrade in a bunch of years.\n\n*Ubuntu is known to be faster\n\n\n\nBut here is how to install Windows alongside Ubuntu:\nPretty large amount of steps, but it's not really difficult!\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn a DVD with Ubuntu or Kubuntu.\n\n*Start from the CD/DVD. If it is an Ubuntu DVD, click the Ubuntu icon in the topleft corner and search for GParted. Then click GParted. If it is a Kubuntu DVD, click the blue icon in the downleft corner, click Applications, and search for Partition. Then click the partition manager. You will see something like this in Ubuntu:\n\nAnd something like this in Kubuntu:\n\nAt the top, you can see your partitions. Select the biggest partition.\n\n*Click Partition > Resize/Move\n\n*At \"New size\", lower the number with the amount of MB's you want to reserve for Windows.\n\n*Click Resize/Move, click the green checkmark, click Apply. Wait. Click OK.\n\n*Shut down your computer. The DVD will automatically be ejected. When asked, remove the DVD, close the tray, and press Enter.\n\n*Start from the Windows 7 installation disk.\n\n*Choose \"Install now\". Then choose \"Custom (advanced)\". Then choose \"Disk 0 Unallocated space\". Then choose Next.\n\n*Wait until installation is finshed. Your computer will start from Windows. When Windows is installed (and has performed some post-installation operations), turn off your computer.\n\n*Boot from the Ubuntu or Kubuntu DVD again. Select Try Ubuntu. Connect to Wi-Fi.\n\n*Now we, unfortunately, have to use the terminal. Press Ctrl + alt + T. The terminal will appear. Type in these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n*With Ubuntu, click the Ubuntu icon in the top-left corner and search for Boot Repair. With Kubuntu, click the blue icon in the down-left corner and search for Boot Repair. Click Boot Repair. You should now see something like this:\n\n\n*Click Recommended repair and wait until it's finished.\n\n*Shut down your computer. The DVD will automatically be ejected. When asked, remove the DVD, close the tray, and press Enter.\n\n*DONE!!! Every time you turn on your PC, you can choose between Ubuntu and Windows 7 using the arrow keys. Just use the arrow keys to select Ubuntu or Windows and press Enter. If you do nothing for 10 seconds, it will automatically start Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Regular audio corruption when listening to music I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 (though the problem was also present under 12.04) on an HP Pavilion dv7 laptop.\nEvery so often, if I change the system volume while listening to music, the sound becomes corrupted - that is to say, random crackly artifacts get interspersed within the audio. If I had to describe it, it's sort of as if the music had been mixed with the sound that played when connecting to a dial-up connection back in the day - just random, data-sounding clicks and pops, interspersed with sudden (fraction-of-a-second-long) mutes. When this happens, some volume levels will mute the sound entirely and become a series of high-pitched crackles; switching volume back will restore the (still-corrupted) sound.\nThis happens in both Rhythmbox and Audacious, as well as with Flash e.g. when watching YouTube videos. The problem is very sporadic - sometimes it won't happen for a week, sometimes it will happen twice within the same day. The only link is changing the system volume, but there's no other common element (no particular volume threshold that always triggers it, say). One thing I have noticed is that it happens often if I change the fade slider between front and rear speakers (The laptop has a subwoofer, which for some reason is seen by Ubuntu as the front speaker - so I generally have to pan it slightly towards the rear so as not to have an overabundance of bass - the corruption when changing volume, though, happens when I am using headphones as well as when using the built-in speakers)\nClosing all applications (or Firefox tabs, in the case of Flash) that are using the sound card in some way and re-opening them fixes the problem.\nThis could possibly be linked to the HDMI port on the laptop (I don't use it but have heard things about its less-than-great interactions between this model and Ubuntu's sound drivers), or perhaps to the issue where I have to open alsamixer and change the Speaker volume to get my headphones to work whenever they are plugged in; but beyond that I can't think of any specific cause or solution for this.\nLet me know if there are any debug outputs that would help figuring out the cause of this issue (I don't know for certain what diagnostics I can run for this)\nSo far I've identified this happening in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rhythmbox\n\n*Audacious\n\n*Firefox (w/Flash player)\n\n*VidyoDesktop (conference calling software)\n\n\nI'd be hesitant to say that this is affecting all sound applications, but that could well be the case - it happens so intermittently that it's difficult to test in specific programs.\nUpdate: Even stranger, over the last couple of days it has ceased to be simply a \"when changing volume\" issue, and sometimes happens simply when changing tracks (though changing the volume exacerbates it once it's started). I'm starting to wonder whether it could be some strange interaction between the MP3 codecs and the sound drivers [I have a dualboot system with music in MP3 format stored on my Windows drive] - though that wouldn't go any way to explaining why it also happens with Flash, so I am utterly stumped.\n\nA: Reference:- http://forum.notebookreview.com/hp-compaq/331172-hp-dv7-sound-fix-ubuntu.html\nA fix was found for the sound problems with DV7 notebooks when running ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal.\n\n*In the terminal: type sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\n*This will open that file in gedit. Scroll to the bottom of the\nfile and add a new line: options snd-hda-intel enable_msi=1\n\n*Save the file and close gedit (you can now also stop the terminal).\n\n*Reboot the computer.\n\n\nAfter rebooting, the sound should work properly.\n\nA: This issue seems to have been fixed in Saucy (13.10), so if anyone else is having similar problems the best course of action would be to upgrade to that version or newer (if a newer, supported release exists by the time you read this)\n", "Q: How to install firefox 20 in Ubuntu 12.04 I am using Firefox version 21, but it is too slow and many a time hangs the system.\nI want to downgrade my Firefox to version 20.\nPlease tell me how to install through ppa repository or other method.\n\nA: Like Jez W suggested it is not advisable to downgrade your browser.

How do I restart the GPU from command line?\nUsing a HP DV6 laptop with Ubuntu 12.04-64 and an ATI mobile GPU. Installed the standard ATI propriety drivers suggested by Ubuntu. When I close the lid, the computer goes down to suspend mode. When open the lid, everything but the screen resumes again. Just black. I'll guess I have to put a GPU reset script in /etc/pm/sleep.d. But how do I restart/reset the GPU?\n\nA: Try if switching back and forth from the graphic screen to a virtual tty works. I mean, when you have the black screen, try to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and, if and when you have the login screen, Alt+F7. If the graphic screen doesn't come back, stop reading...\nIf the screen comes back you can try to add this to your sleep scripts (kudos to the forum entry http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1978290:)\n#!/bin/sh\n# \n\ncase \"${1}\" in\n        hibernate|suspend)\n\n        chvt 1 \n        ;;\n        resume|thaw)\n\n        chvt 7\n        ;;\nesac\n\nPut this script in a file in your /etc/pm/sleep.d/ directory, for example 99_vthack, and make it executable: \nsudo chmod 755 /etc/pm/sleep.d/99_vthack \n\nThe 99_ means that this script is run at the end of the resume sequence. \nThis hack seems to work in a series of AMD-based laptops. YMMV... \n\nA: Run one of the next commands in terminal or, better, in TTY# using Ctrl+Alt+F#, where # is a number from 1 to 6:\nsudo /etc/init.d/lightdm restart\n\nor\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nThis will restart the graphics environment.\nI don't know yet from what reason, but these commands worked for me only in TTY. Anyway, if you are stuck in a black screen after you are running one of these commands in terminal, just go in TTY and run next command:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nFrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM:\n\nLightDM is the default display manager for Ubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu\n  and Mythbuntu since 11.10 release, for Lubuntu since 12.04 release,\n  and for Kubuntu beginning with 12.10.\n\nSo, restarting LightDM entail restarting the GDM without rebooting the machine\n\nA: After installing this package, you should be able to use this script to resolve your issue. I am using a Dell Vostro 1000.\nAs the screen is messed, you will have to bind a key to start this script, I suggest Shift+Ctrl+Alt+F. Also, for each try fix step, it will speak what it is doing, so you will know what is happening. When the screen gets fixed, hit Ctrl+C to stop the script (it should be started using xterm to be interactive).\nWhat it does is basically change between all possible screen resolutions, and may also open a new X session to try to force the workaround to work.\nIt wont work if the screen is locked though, so you will have at least to blind login.. OR maybe if run on the text console vt 1, with DISPLAY=:0, may do the trick too.\n", "Q: How to make IP forwarding permanent?

It was a executable(application/x-executable) file.\nThank you.\n\nA: That all depends on what it is...\nGenerally speaking, you can use gedit testing to open the file and view the contents, if it's in some plaintext format.\nI see you've tagged the question as \"executable\", so I assume it's a program of some sort? If that's the case, first verify the following: Do you know exactly where the file came from originally; Do you trust the source; Do you know exactly what the program is supposed to do? If the answer to any one of these three questions is \"no\", then please do NOT try to run it.\nIf (and ONLY if) the answer to all of the above was \"yes\", though, then in a terminal you would navigate to the folder containing the file and write chmod +x testing; ./testing to execute it. The first changes the file permission so that it is executable, and the second tells it to run. I hope you'll forgive me for not trying this myself though, since running anonymous executables isn't really the best of ideas.\n", "Q: Why is python so slow on Raring? In order to run a few benchmarks on my newly installed 13.04, I wrote the below fibonacci script in python. It basically accepts a number and starts crunching fibonacci numbers that many times:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport time\nfrom time import time\n\ndef fibo(n):\n    a,b,i=0,1,0\n    while i<n:\n        #print b\n        a,b = b,b+a\n        i+=1\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s=time()\n    fibo(1000000)\n    print round((time()-s)*1000,0),\"ms\"\n\nHowever, when the fibo() function is called with 1 million as parameter, the python seems to hang. While, this similar code in java runs instantly:\nclass fibonacci\n{\n    private static void fibo(int n)\n    {\n        int a=0,b=1,i=0;\n        while( i<n)\n        {\n            //print b\n            int t=a;\n            a=b;\n            b=b+t;\n            i++;\n        }\n    }   \n\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        float s=System.currentTimeMillis();\n        fibo(1000000);\n        System.out.println( (System.currentTimeMillis()-s) + \"ms\");\n    }\n}\n\nWhat is the reason for this? Is python inherently that slow or is something wrong with my raring installation ?\n\nA: A little excerpt from http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons.html should answer your question.\nThe short answer is in the first sentence ;)\n\n\"Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java\n  programs, but they also take much less time to develop. Python\n  programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java\n  programs. This difference can be attributed to Python's built-in\n  high-level data types and its dynamic typing. For example, a Python\n  programmer wastes no time declaring the types of arguments or\n  variables, and Python's powerful polymorphic list and dictionary\n  types, for which rich syntactic support is built straight into the\n  language, find a use in almost every Python program. Because of the\n  run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. For\n  example, when evaluating the expression a+b, it must first inspect the\n  objects a and b to find out their type, which is not known at compile\n  time. It then invokes the appropriate addition operation, which may be\n  an overloaded user-defined method. Java, on the other hand, can\n  perform an efficient integer or floating point addition, but requires\n  variable declarations for a and b, and does not allow overloading of\n  the + operator for instances of user-defined classes.\nFor these reasons, Python is much better suited as a \"glue\" language,\n  while Java is better characterized as a low-level implementation\n  language. In fact, the two together make an excellent combination.\n  Components can be developed in Java and combined to form applications\n  in Python; Python can also be used to prototype components until their\n  design can be \"hardened\" in a Java implementation. To support this\n  type of development, a Python implementation written in Java is under\n  development, which allows calling Python code from Java and vice\n  versa. In this implementation, Python source code is translated to\n  Java bytecode (with help from a run-time library to support Python's\n  dynamic semantics).\"\n\n\nA: Looking at your Java code, I notice you are using int for the Fibonacci numbers.\nOn the other hand, Python is using arbitrary precision.\nAlso notice that the Fibonacci numbers won't fit in an int variable for n > 46!\nSo the Java code isn't even calculating Fibonacci numbers for n > 46.\nYou should change the int for some bigger data type (an arbitrary precision one, maybe), before you make the comparison.\nConclusion, Java runs this much faster because it is calculating with ints (a fixed size data type), while Python is using more and more RAM to accumulate for the ever increasing numbers (which eventually cease to fit in a 32-bit integer).\nTry this:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom time import time\n\ndef int32(x):\n    x &= 0xffffffff\n    if x > 0x7fffffff:\n        return - ( ~(x - 1) & 0xffffffff )\n    else:\n        return x\n\ndef fibo(n):\n    a,b,i=0,1,0\n    while i<n:\n        t = a\n        a = b\n        b = int32(b + t)\n        i+=1\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s=time()\n    fibo(1000000)\n    print round((time()-s)*1000,0),\"ms\"\n\nto see approximately how much time would it take if Python used ints.\n", "Q: problem with samba I recently installed samba and the computer gave an error message saying that samba could not be installed... after that the same error message came for anything that i installed...\npl. help I'm very new to Ubuntu...\nthe error message when Itried it again\nsudo apt-get install samba smbfs\n[sudo] password for simon: \nReading package lists...

How can I add 20G to sda4 extended.\n\nA: First, BACKUP YOUR DATA. I really, really mean that. \nSince partitions have to be contiguous, you'll have to move the free space to either end of sda4 (did you really mean sda4, the Win 95 partition? \nBoot from a Live CD containing gparted, and run gparted. Do NOT try to boot from disk and run gparted on the same disk.\nUse gparted to move partition sda9 up 20GB (to the end of the free space). This will put your 20GB free space between sda8 and sda9.\nRepeat moving sda8, then sda7, then sda6, and finallysda5 up 20GB. This will put the free 20GB between sda4 and sda5.\nUsing gparted, extend sda4 to include the 20GB.\nNow, all that's left is to inform Windows that it's disk has grown. I don't know how to do that, and this is the wrong place to ask.\nHaving the disk partitioned the way you do is sub-optimal. Read partitioning How-Tos, etc. at the Linux Documentation Project, at IBM Developer Works, at ccfl.edu, and at LinuxQuestions.\nThe 'good' way (IMHO) to partition a disk is to have a few, not too big, partitions at the beginning of the disk (/boot, swap, foreign Operating Systems), then an \"Extended\" partition covering the rest of the disk, with the rest of the partitions allocated within it. \nBACKUP YOUR DATA! \n", "Q: Moving to Linux The family PC is riding off into the sun. \nI want to replace it with a Linux solution.

It's a cloud storage service that tightly integrates with Ubuntu and you can access your files from any device running Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu, iOS or Android.\n\nWe also use Google for docs, calendar, sites, drive, basically everything so I need compatibility there also.\n\nThere is an amazing feature in Ubuntu called Unity Web Apps. It allows supported web applications to act as installed ones. Just open a supported webapp in Firefox (Or Chromium. Other web browsers don't work) and you will be prompted to install it with Unity Web Apps. Google Docs and Google Calender are supported!\nUbuntu's mail client, Evolution, supports GMail. But GMail also supports Unity Web Apps.\nYou can use Sites in Firefox.\nAbout Drive: Unfortunately, Google is lazy and haven't released a Linux version of the Google Drive client yet.

This means the same errors might pop even if the OS would run with updated NVidia Drivers (you can use the proprietary drivers -- to install them just execute the .run file from a shell) or, maybe, only WITHOUT the updated drivers.\nIt is possible that Windows 7 doesn't include (At least I guess it doesn't) the real NVidia Drivers, but at most compatible but less powerful ones (like those originally found on Ubuntu). If so, you have to update the HOST drivers from HERE!\n\nA: Have you installed Virtualbox Guest Additions tools on the virtual machine? Once the machine is running go to the menu tab that says devices, go down to the last option on the menu and press the Insert CD with Gest Additions option, you will see a CD booting inside the OS, install the drivers and you will get better performance, hope it helps.\n", "Q: search lan in resolv.conf On 12.04 server, I have static NIC config, but I want to remove lan from the dns search path, or resolv.conf.

Though i have been using the Ubuntu OS on my system for a while, it is for the first time I am trying to learn the nuances and hence starting with the documentation.\nI am wondering , if we use apt-get command to install packages, what does apt-get install aptitude do ?\n\nA: apt-get install PACKAGE_NAME\n\nIs the command used to install any package you know the name for, like aptitude. \nsudo is used to earn root access and be able to install and remove software. sudo is always required if you do system wide changes like installing, removing, updating and upgrading packages. \napt-get\n\nIs the command used to manage any software and software sources. install is an extra command that tells the computer that you want to install software with the package name as follows. It will then check the software sources for a download link with the same name and then download and install the latest version (or specified version). \nupdate\n\nwill update the sofware sources with new versions of the software listed (not installing anything)\nupgrade\n\nupgrades the software if new versions are available in the software sources. \nremove\n\nremoves the package name specified after (like install). \nthere are more useful commands, but these are necessary for getting started with managing software from the terminal. \nAptitude\nAfter more research on aptitude i found out that it's already installed. So installing aptitude wouldn't resolve in anything besides errors in the conosle. Start aptitude by:\nsudo aptitude\n\nThe aptitude package is a GUI version of the apt-get command, it hasn't got the full set of features as apt-get but you have the basics like, remove, update, upgrade, install, etc. More information about aptitude and it features can be found here. \nAlso search in the software center if you want o use a GUI to find and install/uninstall applications. \nUseful sources: \n\n\n*\n\n*Installing software - Ubuntu wiki\n\n*apt-get/HowTo - Ubuntu wiki\n\nA: simple , it will install a package named as aptitude.\nthe syntax of installing packages is sudo apt-get install <pkg_name>\nfor more information : wiki-Ubuntu\n\nA: The command apt-get install aptitude will install a graphical package manager called aptitude. \nAptitude is a famous package manager with a ncurses GUI. I prefer it over the other package managers, since it is faster(IMHO) and the conflict management system works very well.\nbr \n\nA: sudo executes your actions as the root user, so you don't get privilege problems, same as entering your password when installing something off the Software Center.\napt-get is what you are executing - the program, if you will, which handles apt files and most installation.\ninstall is the argument for the execution, telling it to install something, and then\naptitude is the package name which you are installing.  \nIt's exactly the same thing that it'd do if you went to the Software Center, searched for 'apitude' (which may show a different name), and hit install.  \n", "Q: How can I prevent the alt-tab shortcut from nesting terminal windows?

Is there a way that I can just have it treat the multiple terminal windows like separate applications so I can switch through faster? \nThanks!\n\nA: If you don't want to wait around for the group to expand when alt-tabbing, you can use the grave key (`) while still holding alt  - this should be to the left of the 1 key on your keyboard. This is useful if you want to pick the window of an application that isn't currently active (e.g. you have many terminals open but are currently in Firefox)\nYou can also directly use alt-` without pressing tab at all, if for example a terminal window is currently active and you want to switch to a different terminal window.\nEssentially, alt-tab switches between applications; alt-` switches between windows within an application. \n", "Q: Sign in in a website using the terminal I'm trying to sign in in a website using this command: wget --save-cookies cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies --post-data 'login_email=aaaaaaa&login_password=123456' http://aaaaa.com/index.php\nbut it doesn't work.

I've tried dpkg and all the recovery options from GRUB. \nIs there perhaps any way to re-install Ubuntu while keeping the files intact?\n\nA: To re-install and keep files intact, keep in mind that there is no guarantee all your files will be intact.  So its best to have a backup handy just in-case.  Plus the best way that I recommend that you do a fresh install once you get all your files.\nTo get your files, just copy the folders that you want to save like Downloads, Documents, Music, etc. to a different partition, Re-install Ubuntu, and after the installation is done copy the folders over. \nFor reference, the best way you can preserve your settings is to use a separate /home partition. That way, whenever you re-install, just define your /home partition by selecting Something Else, to create manual partitions and choose not to format it. Make sure you have 3 partition. /, /home and Swap.\nTo get a list of applications that you have installed so you can install them once you re-install Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu Software Center to see installed applications. \n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 13.04 but automatically loads Windows, doesn't let me choose I installed Ubuntu without a problem, but when I turn on the computer it automatically loads Windows without asking which one I want to load.

The themes do list out in the list under theme preferences but they don't get applied...(I did restart gimp)\nWhat's possibly wrong?\n\nA: Usually you place the theme folder within ~/.themes so you can pick them as a general theme as well. When using the theme only for a single application, it does not matter where you place them, but you might as well place them in the usual place.\nIf you open a terminal window and run the following command, you can see that it will open the application with the specified theme:\nGTK2_RC_FILES=/path/to/your/theme/gtkrc gimp\n\nOf course, you need to replace /path/to/your/theme/gtkrc with the path to the gtkrc file, which is located in the gtk-2.0 folder of the theme. \nNow, you don't want to have to run a terminal command every time you want to start the Gimp. Luckily, we can edit the command executed when we start the Gimp, as follows.\nThis command is defined in the .desktop file. Since we want to run Gimp in this theme for the current user, we first have to copy the first system-wide .desktop file to our user directory. This can be done with the following terminal command:\ncp /usr/share/applications/gimp.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\n\n(Note that you might have to create the folder /home/vincent/.local/share/applications first if it does not exist yet.)\nNext, we edit the new file:\n gedit ~/.local/share/applications/gimp.desktop\n\nHere, you can see a line that starts with Exec= followed by the command to run the Gimp. Simply prefix that command by GTK2_RC_FILES=/path/to/your/theme/gtkrc and save the file. Next time you run the Gimp, it will be in your dark theme!\n", "Q: Brasero makes unusable DVD's Brasero is fond of writing .md5 CRC files on the DVD.  Most DVD players are allergic to \nstray files and refuse to play DVD's with .md5 files written on them\nWhy on earth does Brasero do this and how can it be stopped.\nOh, while we are here, I tried Brasero's video writer, but it refused to write a directory and demanded a single file.  The DVD source I have, uses a VIDEO_TS directory.  This is a common industry standard.  \n\nA: Just disable the \"Image Checksum\" plugin if you don't want Brasero to write the .md5 file on the disc.\nFor the DVD-Video, I've never tried this but you could make an ISO using genisoimage and then burn it.\ngenisoimage -dvd-video -udf -o iso_file.iso folder\nWhere \"folder\" is the folder containing the VIDEO_TS/AUDIO_TS directories and iso_file.iso is the ISO that you will burn.\nAs I said I've never tried this before, so try this ISO file first using VLC. If VLC loads the ISO correctly you should burn it without problems.\n\nA: As for creating a video DVD (or ISO):\nK9Copy is a powerful tool that can read a VIDEO_TS directory structure (or a DVD) and either extract the video files or create a video DVD (depending on what output mode you've selected).\nTo install K9Copy on Ubuntu, you need to enable the multiverse repository, either by changing the config file or by using the Software Sources gui.

When I do restart the machine that way, next time Ubuntu starts, there's no indication that a faulty shutdown occurred, everything proceeds as intended.\nI would love to investigate this issue and figure out what's going on, since not being able to restart the machine remotely is a show stopper.\nAre there any logs I could look into to understand this better?

I'm a beginner on Linux, but I want to get more practised.\nThanks a lot!\nJenne\n\nA: Try to use the Canon Advanced Printing Technology (CAPT). It's an official closed-source printer driver. This link can help you through the installation and configuration.\n\nA: I have the same printer myself and solved it this way on Ubuntu 14.04:\nCompile and install driver\nThere is an open-source driver for canon carps printers on github. You'll have to compile it yourself and configure some stuff.\nFirst, download a zip of the source code: https://github.com/ondrej-zary/carps-cups/archive/master.zip\nExtract the .zip file, open a terminal and go to the extracted folder. To make sure you are in the correct folder, type ls and you should see a similar output:\n~/Downloads/carps-cups-master$ ls\ncarps-decode    carps.h    Makefile       rastertocarps.c  test-encode.sh\ncarps-decode.c  carps.txt  ppd            README.md\ncarps.drv       LICENSE    rastertocarps  test-decode.sh\n\ninstall the dependencies: \nsudo apt-get install make gcc libcups2-dev libcupsimage2-dev cups-ppdc\n\ncompile and install the packages:\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nNow, when you try to add the printer via the \"printers\" dialog, it should automatically detect the correct driver. However, to get the PC-D320 working perfectly, we still have to change some configuration.\nPC-D320 specific configuration\nWithout this configuration, the printer only prints the first print job, and you have to restart the printer to print a second print job.\nsudo nano /etc/cups/cups-files.conf\n\nand change #FileDevice No to FileDevice Yes.

Is there something I am missing? I am dual booting, from desktop, not a cd, from some reason even when I boot from cd first it does not start. \n\nA: I installed Ubuntu 13.04 on a Dell Inspiron 5720.  Are you booting in UEFI mode? Or Legacy?  If you are booting in UEFI mode, you may need to go into the BIOS (hold down F2 at the Dell boot screen) and go over to the Boot tab.  My laptop lists boot priority.  If Ubuntu isn't listed, go down to Add and select the Ubuntu partition, then go down to the file selection and look for the bootx64.efi file in the /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu.  (It has been a little bit since I did this.  And I can't edit my entry to see what I have selected.)  This may allow you to boot ubuntu.  It sounds like Ubuntu isn't passing secureboot, and the laptop is attempting to go to Windows by default.  I hope this will be of some help.\n", "Q: Pages are visually corrupted in Chrome Pages are loading fine in Chrome, but then some kind of jitter appears. It happens on pages with and without Flash. I'm on Ubuntu 13.04 with Intel HD 3000 video card.\nHow do can I figure out what's the problem?\nUPD: Same bug happens in Steam client.\n\n\n\nA: I believe that your issue revolves around one of two things: the GPU drivers for your Intel GPU or Flash (Steam runs on a special version for most of the client), so try re-configuring/re-installing both.\nFor the GPU, try this: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel (You may need to get rid of the existing one)\nAs for Flash, the Steam option instructions can  be found here, and the standard player version can be found on Adobe's website.\nNOTE: I have heard of Flash issues on Chrome for Linux before, you can read a detailed support document here off Adobe's help site.\nRestarting the machine in both cases is likely necessary.\n\nA: Try this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Write chrome://plugins on the address bar and hit Enter;  \n\n*Find \"Adobe flash player(2 files)\" and disable it;\n\n\nRestart Chrome and let me know the outcome.\n", "Q: Why can I boot Xubuntu 12.04 from usb on one computer but not the other?

The core of the issue is that every so often I'll be booted off my wireless. Sometimes the wireless continues to say connected but the net isn't working, sometimes it switches to limited, and sometimes it just boots me completely off and I try to reconnect only to run into issue number one (says \"connected\", but nothing is happening). Sometimes this happens almost non-stop every 5-10 minutes for a few hours; sometimes it doesn't happen for days at a time. I haven't noticed any trends in terms of my location, the time of day, the amount of items connected to the router, etc. \nI initially thought the issue was connected to our wireless because a few devices in the house were having different but seemingly related problems (playing online video games on wireless with random spiking lag and a smart tv that downright refused to stream as it should). We recently upgraded our router to fix these issues. All the other devices are fine now, running smooth as butter, while my issue remains exactly the same. \nAny ideas or further information I can provide that would be helpful?\nThanks!\n\nA: It is a hardware problem of the network adapter (qualcomm atheros) in that and other ACER models. \nI have the same model and looking on the internet found a simple solution to this issue, though I don't know why it works.\nHere it is:\nOpen the lid on the bottom of your notebook (there are two screws). Inside you'll see the wifi card with a white and a black cable attached to it (the antennas). Gently unplug the black cable, it's not sealed, so you can plug it back in anytime.\nThat's it! Now just close the lid leaving the black cable unplugged and try your wifi.\nYou should experience no more problems.\n", "Q: How do I take Win 7 off a dual boot mini \nI have an HP mini with dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 and Win 7.

Both Ubuntu and Fedora can share the same swap partition without any problems. \nWhen your computer starts, you're given the choice to boot ONE operating system - Ubuntu or Fedora. That one OS you choose to boot will use the swap partition when necessary. The other OS can't use the swap space, as it hasn't booted yet.\nTo make Ubuntu and Fedora share a swap area, choose the existing swap partition as the mount point for Fedora's swap area when you install it, rather than creating an entirely new swap area.\n\nA: \nWhen you shrink a partition other partitions are not affected.\n\nThus the swap partition can be shared with Fedora.\nInfact, since only one operating system will be booted at a time, the swap partition can be shared among any number of operating systems.\nThe swap partition will remain intact as it has nothing to do with your Ubuntu partition.\nAfter you shrink the Ubuntu Partition, you will get a Ubuntu Partition (with a smaller disk space) and some free space.\n", "Q: I cannot reduce the screen brightness on my Acer Aspire 5742 I cannot reduce the screen brightness in Ubuntu 13.04, my device is an Acer Aspire 5742.

How would I go about to make sure it updates the status of a directory of real time?\nPresently I cannot even use back to update and constantly have to reopen dolphin, verry annoying\n\nA: The way in order to refresh Dolphin is to press F5. However, this would be manual. \nIn order to continuously refresh, an automatic solution, create a bash script that runs on boot. This bash script should press F5 every five seconds if Dolphin is open. Create a file named dolphin-update in /usr/local/bin with the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n    PID=$(pgrep \"dolphin\")\n    if [ \"$?\" -ne \"0\" ]; then\n        xdotool key 'F5'\n    fi\n    sleep 5\ndone\n\nYou may need to first create it as root and then change the owner to your user:\nsudo chown username:username /usr/local/bin/dolphin-update \n\nEnsure that it has executable permissions:\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/dolphin-update\n\nNow we need that to run on boot. To do that run sudo crontab -e and add the following line to the end of the file:\n@reboot /usr/local/bin/dolphin-update\n\nThis script will run on boot.\nYou should now have a continuously refreshing Dolphin!\nThere are some caveats to this script.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you open Dolphin, go to another application where F5 triggers something, (eg Chromium refreshes the page), the script will still run and be a constant annoyance. Solution: Close Dolphin when not actively using it.\n\n*As a cron job is used, if your computer crashes, the script will not run on boot. However this is a problem with cron not the script.\n\n\nWhat the script means, line by line:\n\n\n*\n\n*#!/bin/bash - shebang to run with bash\n\n*while true; do - run continuously\n\n*PID=$(pgrep \"dolphin\") - find the process ID of a dolphin instance. This is purely there to check whether there is even a instance of Dolphin running.\n\n*if [ \"$?\" -ne \"0\" ]; then - check the result of whether there is a Dolphin instance running. If there is, then ...\n\n*xdotool key 'F5' - press F5\n\n*fi - end the if block\n\n*sleep 5 - wait 5 seconds before repeating the process\n\n*done - end the while block\n\n\nA: This seems to be a bug still active in Kubuntu 18.04, where Dolphin would not always automatically refresh and show instantly changes made by another program, in which case manual refresh is needed. F5 seems to work fine for this purpose now.\n\nA: I agree this is a problem with Dolphin. I don't use it, but was testing some bash scripts I wrote on a KDE VM and discovered that although Dolphin does real time updating when in the home folder, it doesn't do it when on /dev/shm. I found your question here and upvoted, because this still needs to be answered.\nWhat I resorted to using in my script is: xdotool key 'F5'\nWhich worked for my script, but isn't exactly real time. My script generates a bunch of files and you can't see it happening, but as soon as done, it \"presses\" 'F5' and the files are visible.\n\nA: Next script uses xdotool to send F5 key to reset dolphin window whenever it has focus.\nSave it, make it executive and run it on boot.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n     # indefinite loop\n     while  : ; do\n         # gets root window property _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW\n         WIN=($(xprop -root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW))\n\n         # extracts window id (base seven)\n         WIN=\"${WIN[4]%%\",\"*}\"\n\n         WIN=\"$(printf \"%s\\n\" ${WIN})\"  # bypass weird array bug\n\n          # Decimal window id of dolphin\n          WindowID=\"$(xdotool search --class \"dolphin\" 2>/dev/null | tail -1)\"\n\n          # Convert dolphin's win id to base seven\n          WindowIDbSeven=$(printf \"0x%07x\" ${WindowID})\n\n         # test if an acive window id mathes with the dolphin's window id\n         if [[ \"${WIN}\" == \"${WindowIDbSeven}\" ]]; then\n             # sends F5 to dolphin's window id\n             xdotool key --clearmodifiers \"$WindowIDbSeven\" F5\n         fi\n\n          # clears array\n          WIN=()\n\n         sleep 5\n     done\n\n\nA: OP's original question is almost 5 years old. There is a master bug posted in 2009 with 15 duplicate bugs pointing to it. The bug fix appeared in Debian (comment # 58) after OP's question was posted.\nThe report that this bug is still happening in 2018 by a new bug report is a little misleading because the user that filed the report (Jeremy9856) has posted a dozen comments trying different solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*updated the number of allowed kernel inotify watches\n\n*disabling tlp which puts drives to sleep\n\n*do mkdir / rmdir several time to trigger the problem\n\n*Another user (comment #10) tested a one-liner and states the problem doesn't exist while true ; do mkdir abc ; sleep 1 ; rmdir abc ; sleep 1 ; done\n\n*when there is an accent in the path (eg. /home/jeremy/Téléchargements/Séries)\n\n\nThe last comment by Jeremy9586 states:\n\nWell I removed the symlinks of the folders inside /home (Desktop,\n  Downloads, etc...) that pointed to /media/Data and used kde settings\n  (in applications) to change the places of these folders and I didn't\n  had the problem for about a week !\nSo can it be related to the symlinks ?\n\n\nSummary\nThe bug the OP had was first reported in 2009 and solved in 2013.\nThe bug the new bounty points to appears to have nothing to do with refreshing file list in general and need to press F5. The bug was caused by symbolic links between /home and /media/home.\n\nA: xdotool can send F5 key to dolphin on mouse-enter event or whenever it's window gets focus.\nThese commands run indefinetely so you can set one of them to run on boot.\nFinds the window with class dolphin and sends the F5 whenever mouse pointer enters window:\nxdotool search --onlyvisible --class dolphin  behave %@ mouse-enter key F5\n\nFinds the window with class dolphin and sends the F5 whenever dolphin gets focus:\nxdotool search --onlyvisible --class dolphin  behave %@ focus key F5\n\n", "Q: remove grub when there is no Ubuntu I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my partitioned hard disc:\n/dev/sda\n/dev/sda1   ntfs   Windows\n/dev/sda2   ntfs   Backup Disk\n/dev/sda3   ext4   Ubuntu 12.04\n\nI can boot from Ubuntu and Windows via Grub.

Searching the web for this ID will give you better technical information about the protocol the usb device uses.\n\nA: Instead of trying to use moveslink (windows software) to extract moves from clock you might give OpenAmbit a try. I use it in OpenSuse (instead of moveslink) and transfer moves to MovesCount service via it.\nMore information from OpenAmbit site: https://sourceforge.net/projects/openambit/\n\nA: When first connected, this may appear as a USB storage device. This is typical Windows-device behaviour, and allows the device to auto-load a (Windows) driver.\nUbuntu does not support or need this type of 'unsafe binary' approach to NEW devices. Instead you may need to use USB mode-switch, to get back to full interface with the device.\nStart by checking the output from lsusb, directly after connecting (anf again after 10-20 seconds.\nPS.

(1.9.3.5)\n\n*I have created a 50 GB partition in Windows 8\n\n\nIt starts to boot from USB and displays the choice screen asking whether to try or install Ubuntu.\nI clicked \"Install Ubuntu\". \nSince I use a 3G data card to connect to the internet, I had to continue installation without internet connection.\nAfter which I get to the following screen:\n:\nNo matter which button I click ( + , - , change , continue ) I get this error:\n\nIt says Ubuntu encountered an internal error.\nI tried creating the USB again but it didnt work ... any help ??\nThis is the error report:\n\n\n\nA: 1.Start your windows and open disk management.\n2.Delete the partition newly created(50GB) and make it unallocated(Free space).\n3.Now try to install ubuntu alongside Windows8 using the live USB you had created earlier.\n\nA: First, you should not disable EFI/UEFI in your firmware if you intend to dual-boot with the existing Windows 8 installation. At best, the firmware will ignore this option and you'll end up with an EFI-based installation anyhow. At worst, disabling EFI/UEFI support will result in a BIOS-mode Ubuntu installation aside an EFI-based Windows installation, which will complicate your boot loader/boot manager setup and your OS selection when you boot. This is almost certainly not the source of the problem about which you're posting, but it deserves prominent mention lest you overcome that problem and run into another one right away....\nAs to your problem, it appears that the installer is recognizing your hard disk as being completely unpartitioned, despite the fact that it's got existing partitions. This symptom is usually caused by one of three problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leftover RAID data on a disk that's not actually using RAID. If you're positive that your disk isn't using RAID, you may be able to overcome this problem by typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda. Don't type this command unless you're positive that you're not using RAID, though; if you are using RAID, this command will damage your RAID data structures.\n\n*A damaged partition table. This can be better diagnosed using gdisk, which is installed in the gdisk package, IIRC. See the gdisk documentation on disk repairs for details; but in brief, launching gdisk on the disk and then typing v should produce a list of problems with the disk. gdisk can fix some such problems automatically, but others will require more work to identify and fix. Be cautious; if you don't know what you're doing, you can end up doing more damage with gdisk. If you try gdisk and suspect your partition table is damaged but you don't know how to proceed, please edit your original post and include gdisk's output. (Precede each line cut-and-pasted from a Terminal window with four spaces to format it in a monospace font for legibility.)\n\n*An unsupported disk controller. If your hard disk isn't recognized by Linux, then Linux can't do anything with it. IIRC, though, you wouldn't see \"/dev/sda\" in the radio button near the bottom of the first screen shot if this were the case, so I doubt if this is what the problem is. If it is, though, you might be able to get it to work by moving the hard disk's cable from one motherboard connector to another -- many motherboards have multiple disk controllers, and sometimes one of these works with Linux whereas another one doesn't. If this is the problem, then an attempt to use gdisk will produce an error message of The specified file does not exist!\n", "Q: Set new window to open at center of the screen - Xubuntu How to set newly opened window at the center of the screen in Xubuntu?

Tried this install three times now..\n\nA: *\n\n*Shut down your computer.\n\n*Remove your USB stick.\n\n*Now start your computer.\nI hope this will work for you. \n\n\nA: Boot with the USB stick in, and open terminal.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below: \nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou will see something like that image below. look for the device with the boor flag.  In the example its /dev/sda1.  \n\nYou case might be different.  Once you find out your boot device, just do\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdxx\n\nReplace the xx with your device ID.  Once done, shut down the machine and remove your USB device.\n\nA: On some older PCs, removing the USB device (containing USB startup/installer) remaps the existing devices.\nThis leaves the GRUB target (to install Ubuntu from) invalid. I haven't seen this is a couple of years, it mainly affected me on 10.04 LTS.\n\nYou need to run update-grub, without the USB stick being present. There were a couple of techniques, like booting (with stick) and then running update-grub from Ubuntu (after stick removed). This was always temperamental ..*\nThe other approach was using the USB-stick to get to recovery mode, but that worked best with the (older) Alternative installer (as opposed to Desktop or Server) with its additional tools, drivers, and utilities.\nAnyone seen this issue with 12.04 LTS or 13.04 ?\n", "Q: What happens to the file system when you \"install alongside\" during install, I have a MacBook with a 200GB partition and 50GB free space.

I'm not interested in their Software Centre only!\nIs there a way to install it in my current Ubuntu as an alternate desktop?\n\nA: This article on Web upd8 says that Deepin is using a patched version of Compiz. So most likely it's not compatible with Unity (which also depends on Compiz).\nYou can still make a dual-boot if you like to use both DE's.\n\nA: Actually you can add Deepin's repository into your /etc/apt/sources.list file and just change their priority in your /etc/apt/preferences.d directory. Then you can easily install and use Deepin's DE.\nI work for Deepin team as an editor. Deepin DOES have Fcitx work out of the box.\nAnd it is NOT the Chinese style to be top-down oriented, as opposed to Christopher Shen Mu Lon answered previously, which is merely out of prejudice. Deepin's distro is also suitable for productive environment and we provide support for this. \nI am just so angry to see that many things Christopher Shen Mu Lon said is not true. I don't know why he said this. \n\nA: We have had some test implementations at the office for our chinese users, but weren't too satisfied with Deepin. There were strategic concerns which might affect you as well:\nDeepin mainly aims at Chinese users, but since the government introduced Ubuntu Kylin as their official OS, we addressed this in our implementation risk matrix. You need to understand the Chinese mindset, which strongly differs from a Western one - they're just more top-down oriented, so when the government says \"that's the right OS\", chances are pretty low that the Deepin community will grow. A smaller userbase directly affects bug fixes and so on. Next to that, Deepin does not provide the user with the Chinese input system fcitx out of the box, while Ubuntu Kylin does, so from our estimation it is very unlikely that a Chinese user would pick some \"hobby distribution\" which needs configuration over the government provided solution which delivers out of the box.\nThe Deepin team maintains many different PPAs. In fact, they maintain a terrible mess with packages here and there, which makes it a no-go for a serious productive environment. If you face some issues, you should know how to read Chinese, since most of the issues are not being discussed in English. You can look here, and I'll post some more mirror server as soon as I am back at the office, where I have stored the URLs.

The localisation also provides you with funny issues. We did not dare to try to implement the Deepin DE on 12.10 or 13.04.\nIf you do not mind about these issues and want to experiment, just go on, it looks lovely indeed.

I clearly want to know: \"You need one for the Master and e.g. five nodes.\"\nDo I need to attach as many NICs (network interface cards) to my master machine as there are nodes, or can I simply attach two NICs and a switch? \nOne NIC for connecting to the internet, one for handling the MaaS tasks, connected to a switch, which connects my nodes to the master?\nIs Juju now ready for local deployment?\nThe last time I experimented with juju and had to reboot my machine, the services orchestrated by juju were gone. This was an issue I also found on the official juju site. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the documentation is not the best, so I could not find the necessary info on that again. So:\nCan I use juju on a local environment or will a reboot break my setup?\n\nA: What are the minimum system requirements for setting up a MaaS cluster, which is going to be orchestrated with juju-jitsu?\nFor the region controller (the master machine), you don't need anything particularly powerful unless you want to manage 100s or 1000s of machines.\nCluster controllers place even fewer demands, but unless you're dealing with more than, say, 200 machines you won't need a dedicated cluster controller anyway.\nThe machines you're going to manage can be pretty much anything, but I strongly suggest that you use machines with IPMI controllers, so that MAAS can control their power. MAAS can use Wake-On-LAN, but only for turning machines on, not off.\nWhat are the minimum requirements for the master machine?\nNothing is particularly RAM or CPU intensive, so a machine with 2GB of RAM and a fairly modest CPU should get you going. You will need disk space for downloaded machine images and logs (MAAS collects remote syslogs), but even something like 20GB should be fine for starters too.\nEvaluating complex tag expressions are one of the few things that MAAS does that are CPU intensive, but it does distribute this load to cluster controllers. The more machines you have under management, the more cluster controllers you will have, and therefore the more machines over which this load will be spread. When you're starting out you almost certainly have nothing to worry about in this regard.\nHow many machines to I need to deploy MaaS on?\nAgain, for getting started, you could have one machine as the region controller and the first cluster controller, and use that to manage 100s of machines.\nWe recommend that you have a dedicated cluster controller for each ~1000 machines, and that the cluster lives on its own broadcast domain. You must also assign a distinct IP subnetwork to each cluster.\nDo I need to attach as many NICs (network interface cards) to my master machine as there are nodes, or can I simply attach two NICs and a switch?\nOne NIC is enough. To prevent broadcast traffic swamping the network, we suggest that you don't put more than ~1000 machines in each broadcast domain.\nIs Juju now ready for local deployment?\nCan I use juju on a local environment or will a reboot break my setup?\nI'll leave the Juju questions for someone with more experience to answer.\n\nA: This is a partial answer only to your local deployment question. Juju's local provider in .7 is intended for local development of charms, and as you've found rebooting really breaks that workflow.\nJuju will not have a production ready local provider until the end of this summer; however it will have support for surviving a reboot. \n", "Q: How can i remove packages without other packages? I'm using 13.04, and I want to remove unused packages. Ex. gnome-power-manager, but i can't.\nbekir@home:~$ sudo apt-get remove gnome-power-manager \nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:\n  gnome-power-manager ubuntu-desktop\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 2 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nAfter this operation, 1.690 kB disk space will be freed.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]? \n\nI don't want to remove ubuntu-desktop because he contains other packages. I want to make minimal/simply ubuntu system for me.\nCan anyone help me ?\n\nA: ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It is empty, and only contains metadata such as dependencies and a description, to provide a simple way to install a whole desktop environment. It will also make it possible for to \"push\" new packages to be installed. This can be very much helpful over the five years Ubuntu is supported when the development of an application has stopped and they want to provide an alternative by default.\nAs gnome-power-manager is a hard dependency of the ubuntu-desktop package, you can't simply remove it without breaking the ubuntu-desktop package installation. And this is what APT is telling you here: it can only proceed with your decision to break the metapackage requirements. You can proceed with removing both packages, but that will make upgrades a bit harder, as you will have to handle any new packages yourself.\n$ apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop\nPackage: ubuntu-desktop\nPriority: optional\nSection: metapackages\nInstalled-Size: 57\n[...]\nSource: ubuntu-meta\nVersion: 1.267.1\nDepends: alsa-base, alsa-utils, [...], gnome-power-manager, [...]\n[...]\nDescription-en: The Ubuntu desktop system\n This package depends on all of the packages in the Ubuntu desktop system\n .\n It is also used to help ensure proper upgrades, so it is recommended that\n it not be removed.\n[...]\n\nIn case you want a very minimal Ubuntu system with only the packages you really pick yourself, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Whenever installing new package, be sure to omit the recommended (but not required) packages, by using an apt-get option:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends packagename\n\nor when using aptitude:\nsudo aptitude install --without-recommends packagename\n\nThis significantly minimizes the amount of packages installed as the result of the single package selected. However, not all packages have separated hard dependencies and recommended ones separated in the requirements.\n\n*don't install ubuntu-desktop, but ubuntu-minimal. You'll have to install Ubuntu using the Server CD and specify you want a minimal install by pressing F4 on the first screen (see below).\n\nThen after installation, you'll have a non-GUI installation. Install the ubuntu-desktop desktop without the recommended packages (see above for how) for a minimal Unity installation, or consider a more minimal GUI installation with LXDE: lubuntu-core. Don't worry about having installed using the Server CD. The Ubuntu flavour is just a set of packages.\n", "Q: How can I make /tmp executable? I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and I tried to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.10. When I clicked in the Update Manager Upgrade a message box apeared:\n\nCannot run the upgrade. This usually is caused by a system where /tmp is mounted noexec. Please remount without noexec and run the upgrade again.\n\nI tried to make /tmp executable in Terminal with the following command:\nmount -o remount,exec /tmp /var/tmp\n\nI pressed Enter and I got the following message from Terminal:\nmount: only root can do that\n\nWhat should I do now to make /tmp executable and upgrade the OS?\n\nA: It shows that your /tmp  is mounted as noexec, so try to mount it with exec option in order to make your upgrade work.\nexec / noexec - Permit/Prevent the execution of binaries from the filesystem.\n\nOpen the  /etc/fstab file as root, for example run\nsudoedit /etc/fstab\n\nChange the below line (/tmp entry on fstab for mine looks like this) from\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777,nosuid,size=512M,noexec 0 0\n\nto\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777,nosuid,size=512M,exec 0 0\n\nOr, if your line looks different, just remove and replace noexec in the fourth column with exec.\nSave that file and then restart your system. Now try to upgrade again.\n\nA: Would you try this command? In my case, this worked.\nsudo mount -t tmpfs -o exec tmpfs /tmp\n\nand then, check if it worked.\nmount\n\n\nA: You need to have root privileges. For this, put sudo in front of the command:\nsudo mount -o remount,exec /tmp\n\nWhen you are asked for a password, just enter your usual user password.\n\nA: Privileges and permissions in linux can be confusing. I recommend reading this before you start using sudo. Once you understand the difference between root, sudo, and normal user, you'll have a much better grasp of why this error happened (and *nix in general). See also the man pages for chown and chmod. \n\nA: Other answers tell you how to make /tmp executable temporarily. To persist this setting:\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount (sudo systemctl edit tmp.mount --full).\n\n*Find the line with mount options (like Options=mode=1777,relatime,nodev,nosuid,noexec).\n\n*Delete the noexec option.\n\nFrom now on, your /tmp will be executable even after restarts!\n", "Q: How to recursively set permissions for files only?

I want to access a computer, say machine A which is based in my university's network. However, this computer is only accessible via the internal network of the university, so I can not use SSH to this computer from home directly.\nHere's what I do now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to a different university machine, say machine B\n(This machine B is accessible via SSH from my home computer.)\n\n*Use SSH on B to connect to A.\nIs there a way to do that faster? Using only one ssh command.\n\nA: You could use the -J command line option:\nssh -J user@machineB user@machineA\n\nFrom man ssh:\n-J [user@]host[:port]\n     Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to\n     the jump host and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the\n     ultimate destination from there.  Multiple jump hops may be\n     specified separated by comma characters.  This is a shortcut to\n     specify a ProxyJump configuration directive.\n\nIt was introduced in OpenSSH version 7.3 (released in August 2016). It is available in Ubuntu 16.10 and later.\n\nA: machineA is the final target.\nmachineB is the broker.\nWe want to do home -- machineB -- machineA easily via ssh.\nIn OpenSSH version 7.3 (released in August 2016) or later, you can do one of the following:\n.ssh/config approach:\nAdd the following lines to your .ssh/config:\nHost machineB\n    Hostname 12.12.12.12           # IP of machineB (w.r.t. home)\n    User usernameB                 # username on machineB\n\nHost machineA\n    Hostname 34.34.34.34           # IP of machineA (w.r.t. machineB)\n    ProxyJump usernameB@machineB   # PROXY MAGIC!\n    User usernameA                 # username on machineA    \n\nThen type ssh machineA. Also compatible with scp.\nYou can augment the above config to also force specific key usage via https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/494485.\n-J flag option:\nJust type ssh -J usernameB@machineB usernameA@machineA.\nFinal notes\nThis answer combines gertvdijk and Erik Sjölund answers with the guide at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Proxies_and_Jump_Hosts#cite_note-ProxyJump-1.\n\nA: Hop in one go\nAn obvious alternative to the ProxyCommand approach I provided in my other answer would be 'hopping' directly to the target machine:\nssh -t user@machineB ssh user@machineA\n\nNote the -t on the first ssh command. Without it, it will fail:\nPseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.\nssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory\nPermission denied, please try again.\n[...]\n\nIt will force a real TTY to be allocated\nDownside of this is that now all configuration, verification and authentication takes place at Machine B, which I really don't like in my situation for security reasons. I like my keypair on my own PC and authenticate and verify the final target machine from my own PC. Additionally, you can only use the interactive shell for SSH, so this won't deal with other tools like SCP or using your GUI file manager.\nFor all the aforementioned reasons I strongly recommend the ProxyCommand approach, but for a quick connect this works fine.\n\nA: This is a very helpful suggestion.  After messing about for hours, I found this note, & confirmed this works exactly as documented.  To connect thru MachineA to MachineB, from remote machineC:\neg:  [xuser@machineC ~] ssh -t MachineA ssh MachineB\nThe \"-t\" is critical, ssh fails if it is not present.\nYou will get prompted twice, first for password on MachineA, then second time for\nMachineB.  Also, note that this assumes you have user \"xuser\" defined on all\nthree machines.  If not, just use the ssh syntax: \"yuser@MachineA ...\".  Also note that\nyou can use dotted quad raw IP#s, if you want to.  This is useful if you are linking\nthru a private local net which is using IPs not exposed to the world - ie. not in \nyour local host file, or any DNS. To get a file from MachineB, to remote machineC,\nyou can scp from MachineB to MachineA, then from MachineA to remote machineC. (Eg. the\nremote machineC can ping MachineA, but not MachineB.) Caveat: I tested with Fedora and WindowsXP, MachineA is an XP-box running ICS (Internet Connection Sharing), while MachineB and remote machineC are Fedora-Linux boxes. This suggestion solved a key problem for me - ie. restricted, monitored remote access to my remote site lan. \nNote also, when you \"logout\" from MachineB, you should see two \"Connection to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx closed.\" messages.\n\nA: Try using \nHost <visible hostname alias>\n        Controlmaster auto\n        User <user>\n        hostname <visible hostname>\n        port <port>\n        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<id file>\n\nHost <private LAN hostname alias>\n     ProxyCommand ssh -q -W <private LAN hostname>:<private LAN port> <visible hostname alias>\n\nin your ~/.ssh/config and do it all in one shot with keys only residing on your computer.\n\nA: Using ProxyCommand in your SSH config.\nCreate an SSH configuration file in your home directory (unless you want to make this system-wide), ~/.ssh/config:\nHost unibroker          # Machine B definition (the broker)\nHostname 12.34.45.56    # Change this IP address to the address of the broker\nUser myusername         # Change this default user accordingly \n                        # (`user@unibroker` can overwrite it)\n\nHost internalmachine    # Machine A definition (the target host)\nProxyCommand ssh -q unibroker nc hostname.or.IP.address.internal.machine 22\n\nNow you can reach Machine A directly using\nssh user@internalmachine\n\nAlso note that now you have a single SSH host target name for it, you can use this in other applications as well. E.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*SCP to copy files.\nscp somefile user@internalmachine:~/\n\n\n*In your GUI applications:\nuse sftp://user@internalmachine/ as the location to browse on the machine.\nKDE-based (Dolphin): use fish://user@internalmachine/\nNotes\nChange hostname.or.IP.address.internal.machine and the port (22) to the machine you like to reach as if you would from the unibroker machine.\nDepending on netcat versions on the unibroker host, the -q0 option must be omitted. Regarding authentication; you're basically setting up two SSH connections from your workstation. This means both the unibroker host and the internalmachine host are verified/authenticated against one after another (for both keypair/password and host key verification).\nExplanation\nThis approach of the use of ProxyCommand and 'netcat' is just one way to do it. I like this, because my SSH client talks directly to the target machine so that I can verify the host key from my client and I can use my public key authentication without using another key on the broker.\nEach Host defines the start of a new host section. Hostname is the target hostname or IP address of that host. User is what you would provide as the user part in ssh user@hostname.\nProxyCommand will be used as the pipe to the target machine. By using SSH to the first machine and directly setting up a simple 'netcat' (nc) to the target from there, this is basically just a plaintext forward to the internal machine from the broker between those. The -q options are to silence any output (just a personal preference).\nMake sure you have netcat installed on the broker (usually available by default on Ubuntu) - either netcat-openbsd  or netcat-traditional .\nNote that you're still using SSH with encryption twice here. While the netcat channel is  plaintext, your SSH client on your PC will set up another encrypted channel with the final target machine.\n\nA: ProxyCommand is a clean solution for a case when you allow shell access in both the systems.  We wanted to give remote users access to an internal machine (A) through a broker (B), but without allowing the user a shell access to B for improved security. This worked:\nReplace the login shell\nReplace the login shell (use chsh) for extuser on the broker with the following script (stored in a file):\n#!/bin/sh   # this is essential to avoid Exec format error\nssh internaluser@A\n\nProvided no password login has been set up in extuser@B for the remote user and in internaluser@A for extuser@B, then executing the following command will directly take the remote user to A\nssh extuser@B\n\nTip: Create the necessary no password login authorized_keys setup in extuser@B before changing to the custom login shell. After the change, since this account is inaccessible to anybody through a shell, only a sudoer@B can make changes to the file authorized_keys by editing it directly.\nsudo vi ~extuser/.ssh/authorized_keys\nsudo touch ~extuser/.hushlogin\n\nThe last line is to supress the login banner display from B, so the remote user has a transparent access to A.\n\nA: You mean you need several jumpers:)\nRecently,I met this problem with jumper1 jumper2 and my final machine,as for my sol\nlocal script:\n#!/bin/bash\nsshpass -p jumper1Passwd ssh -t jumper1@jumper1IP ./Y00.sh\n\nthen on the 1st jumper (which is my router), I placed a script named Y00.sh:\nssh -tt jumper2@jumper2 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa sshpass -p finalPassWord ssh -tt final@final\n\nYou can replace these with your IP and passwords, good luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 cryptsetup failing I recently updated my Ubuntu 12.04, and after I restarted the computer just hangs at the following after I type my decrypt password:\ncryptsetup: sda5_crypt set up successfully\n\nI don't know how I can debug as the system does not respond to any commands other than Ctrl+Alt+Del.

Nevertheless, WINE does not translate the machine code of applications to different processor architectures. Since your computer has a PPC processor (G4), and all Windows applications are either x86, x86_64, IA64 or ARM, WINE would not be of any use for you - therefore it's not available on Ubuntu for PPC.\nI'd suggest to look for open source alternatives for the Windows programs you'd like to run, or to get an x86 (or x86_64) based computer in order to run Windows applications.\nIf this is not an option, what you can do to run Windows applications is to set up a virtual machine with an emulated x86 CPU, but be warned, this will be terribly slow (meaning nearly to totally unusable). There are numerous solutions for this, probably qemu is the one best supported under Ubuntu. If you have a Windows licence, you can set up a virtual machine with Windows installed. If not, you can set up an x86 Linux and use WINE in that.

I would like to know what is this \"0x08059081\" is called. The name, address or reference something like that? And how can I know its value? Is there some way to determine its value or name etc? \n\nA: 0x08059081 is the content adress of a null pointer. You can find more informations on Wikipedia: Segmentation fault example:\n\nBecause a very common program error is a null pointer dereference (a read or write through a null pointer, used in C to mean \"pointer to no object\" and as an error indicator), most operating systems map the null pointer's address such that accessing it causes a segmentation fault.\n\nFor a better answer try to ask on Stack Overflow.\n", "Q: Alternative for Mendeley for Ubuntu Mendeley is essentially (for me) a software that saves the following data:\n\n\n*\n\n*A file\n\n*Tags associated to the file\n\n\nIn practice the files are research papers and the tags are things like author, title etc. Is there any software (preferably open source) that allows one to do the same thing in Ubuntu? \nIn Mendeley the data is stored online (on their server) and therefore I can access the research papers from any computer. I would prefer if the suggested software could the same thing (but I get to choose where it should be saved). But maybe if I'm only able to store things locally I could be able to simulate access-from-everywhere using Git and a web server?\n\nA: I recommend Referencer. You can download it using apt-get. It supports tagging files with fields such as author, title, journal and publisher, etc. For many research papers it will automatically download the data for you provided there is a DOI identifier inside the file. It can also generate BibTex files automatically.\nHowever, it does not store your references online. I use it with git myself, and it works nicely.\n\nA: Whay an alternative, when you can use Mendeley.  In comparison, it comes on top.\nTry Mendeley Desktop for Ubuntu.  It Save time managing PDFs, instantly share thoughts on papers with colleagues and automatically back up and sync your files between different computers.\nTo download ans installation instructions visit their website.\nThis has been tested to work on Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, and 13.04\nIf you still want an Alternative, try Zotero.  \nZotero is a free, easy-to-use Firefox extension or standalone program to help you collect, organize, manage, search and cite your research sources directly in your favourite word processor, with 100 MB free online storage.

I have been using a persistent mode USB when the hard disk of my laptop crashed. I like to mount the USB files on another computer running Ubuntu 12.10. From what I found after internet search, the file system is saved as squashfs file. The only squashfs file was /casper/filesystem.squashfs . I mounted this file using disks application (it used /dev/loop0 device ). However, I could not find the files that I had saved while running from the USB.\nThe files were saved in /home/ubuntu/Downloads. The mounted filesystem has no folder under the home directory. What should I do to retrieve the file on this computer. I do not have the permission to reboot this computer from the persistent USB. I just need the files saved inside the persistent file.\n\nA: filesystem.squashfs is mounted read only. The files you have modified/created are written to casper-rw.

I need help. i recently built a computer using parts in my house. this computer does not currently have an os. so i would like to set up the BIOS so that it would install it automatically. Here is it's specs\nOS:None\nHDD:160 GB\nRAM: 2 GB\nCPU:Intel Pentium 4@2.66 GHZ\n\nA: That hardware should work fine, but you'll need to set your BIOS to boot from a (1) USB drive, (2)  a DVD drive, or, worst case, (3) a CD which will do just enough of an install to get online and finish the job. The only reason you'd choose (3) is if your hardware won't boot from a USB and only includes a CD drive, not a DVD.\nYou'll need to download the .iso file, then create a bootable image on the USB or DVD. Simply copying the .iso file to a DVD or USB will not do. Assuming you're using Windows for this step on another system, you'll need software to do this. unetbootin has a Windows version and is free. Google is your friend.\nWhen you've got the bootable DVD or USB, boot to it. Try to have a WIFI card installed, or ethernet plugged in. Play around with it, get online. When you're ready, double click on the Install icon on the desktop, and follow directions. You'll want to take over the whole hard drive. Don't be shy about starting over and re-installing a couple of times, there are several options you have to choose from, like whole-disk encryption, that you'll wish you'd chosen otherwise.\n", "Q: How do I connect to an Energy Efficient Ethernet enabled switch?

It seems that you're looking at a ...\nJMicron hardware bug\nAccording to the FreeBSD documentation of the JMicron ethernet driver:\n\nIf the full mask revision number of JMC25x controller is less than or equal to 4 and link partner enabled IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet feature, the controller would not be able to establish a 1000baseT link. Also if the length of cable is longer than 120 meters, controller can not establish a 1000baseT link. The known workaround for the issue is to force manual link configuration with 100baseTX instead of relying on auto-negotiation.\n\nSince you have rev 03, you're very much likely running into this issue. So I guess it's time to replace your network interface card or to live with 100Mbit. :)\nIn case this is a new machine (notebook?), I suggest to send it back to the shop for warranty and get the NIC replaced.

From my experience, sshd will look for ~/.ssh/authorized_keys or ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 by default.\nIn the case of my webserver, the /etc/ssh/sshd_config had this line\nAuthorizedKeysFile    %h/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\ninstead of\nAuthorizedKeysFile    %h/.ssh/authorized_keys2\n\nI applied the latter, restarted my ssh daemon, and solved my problem logging in with ssh using my pubkey.\n\nA: Also make sure that the user's home directory (on the server) actually belongs to the user ssh'ing into (was set to root:root in my case).\nShould have been:\nsudo chown username:username /home/username;\n\n\nA: Another possible cause could be with the AllowedUsers configuration in /etc/ssh/sshd_conf.  NOTE: the list is space delimited (not comma delimited) as I learned the hard way.\nAllowUsers user1 user2 user3\n\n\nA: The following method might work if you can access machineA and machineB independently (e.g. from machineC).  \nIf ssh-copy-id is not working, password authentication could be disabled. The following is a workaround.\nHaving machineA's public key in machineB's authorized keys (i.e. ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) will allow you to ssh from machineA. This also applies to scp. \nAfter generating the key pairs using: ssh-keygen\nOn machineA, execute cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nSample output:\n\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaSGMFZW7yB anask@mahineA\n\nCopy the printed key (⌘ Command+C, or CRTL+C) then add it to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on machineB.\nFor example, execute the following on machineB:\n\necho 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaSGMFZW7yB anask@mahineA'  >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\nA: The problem I had was it was using the wrong keys on the client. I had renamed id_rsa and id_rsa.pub to something else.\nYou can either rename them back to their default, or when you issue the ssh command, use it like this\nssh -i ~/.ssh/private_key username@host\n\n\nA: Works on Ubuntu 16.04 as well. \nThe issue is within sshd_config file\nHere is the ULTIMATE solution:\nLog as as a root to you Ubuntu server\nvi /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nNow go to very bottom and change the value from \"no\" to \"yes\".\nIt should look like this:\nChange to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords\nPasswordAuthentication yes\nservice sshd reload\n\nto take effect.\nNow you can simply a key using following command from your LOCAL machine (aka laptop etc)\nSo in order to open a new terminal window and NOT log into server, simply use this command:\nssh-copy-id john@serverIPAddress\n(Replace john with your username).\nyou should be good to go\n\nA: You don't need authorized_keys on your client.\nYou must tell the ssh-client to actually use the key you generated. There are several ways to do that. Just for testing type ssh -vvv -i .ssh/id_rsa [youruser]@[yourLinode]. You will have to provide your passphrase every time you want to connect to the server.\nIf that worked you can add the key to the ssh-agent with ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa (you will have to provide the passphrase only once for this and it should work as long as you don't logout/reboot)\n\nA: I my case, the client is ubuntu 14.04lts, the server was win 2012 server running cygwin.  I was using 'ssh administrator@x.x.x.x', when the 2012 server directory in cygwin was /home/Administrator.  So it was case sensitive, when I tried 'ssh Administrator@x.x.x.x' (note the capital A on Administrator) then it worked fine.  \nAn error message like 'user not found' would have led me to the solution a lot quicker than 'Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)'.\n\nA: I had the same issue when copying a regular user's (e.g. johndoe) public key from a cPanel Centos system over to an Ubuntu server on AWS. As suggested by gertvdijk above, I checked /var/log/auth.log and sure enough it said Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory /home/johndoe. Turns out I had wrongly 777'ed /home/johndoe when trying to set /home/johndoe/public_html as the default virtualhost Document Root for apache2 (that's not needed for that task either).\nSee also the answers here and here\nThe server only needs to have the public key in .ssh/authorized_keys and the client (computer you're working on) needs to have the private key (.pem, or if using SFTP with Filezilla, .ppk)\n\nA: This is what worked for me, the fix is not mine but I would rather write it down here in case someone else has the same problem.\nThe original author posted it here: digital-ocean-public-access-key-denied\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nReplace this\nUsePAM yes\nIgnoreUserKnownHosts no\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nWith this\nUsePAM no\nIgnoreUserKnownHosts no\nPasswordAuthentication yes\n\nSave the file and restart ssh\nreload ssh\n\nssh should work now asking for a password\n\nA: Some people wondering may have set up ssh access to be key only on the root account then created a new user and not realised they need to \nssh root@your-ip-address\nrsync --archive --chown=[user]:[user] ~/.ssh /home/[user]\nlogout\nThen try again. Replace [user] with your new user account. \nThis is common when setting up a new server on DigitalOcean when you've used ssh-keys on setup.\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04\n\nA: Also check value of PasswordAuthentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and if it's no change it to yes. Don't forget to restart ssh service after that.\n\nA: PubKeyAuthentication\nSet up your client\n\n*\n\n*Generate your key.\nssh-keygen\n\n\n\n*Configure ssh to use the key.\nvim ~/.ssh/config\n\nYour config file should have something similar to the following:\nHost SERVERNAME\nHostname ip-or-domain-of-server\nUser USERNAME\nPubKeyAuthentication yes\nIdentityFile ./path/to/key\n\nYou can add IdentitiesOnly yes to ensure ssh uses the specified IdentityFile and no other keyfiles during authentication. Setting IdentitiesOnly prevents failed authentications from occurring, when ssh would otherwise attempt to login with multiple keys.  Setting this is also considered more secure, as you're not leaking information about other keys you have installed, and maintaining separation of your keys between different levels of access.\n\n\n*Copy your key to your server.\nssh-copy-id -i /path/to/key.pub SERVERNAME`\n\nFor example, ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_res.pub -p 22 user@1.1.1.1\nTroubleshooting\n\n*\n\n*use \"-vvv\" option\n\n*Make sure the server has your PUBLIC key (.pub).\n\n*Make sure your IdentiyFile points to your PRIVATE key.\n\n*Make sure your .ssh directory has 700 and the files within are 600 permissions.\n\n*\n\n*ssh-keygen will create files and directories for you with the proper permissions\n\n\n\n*tail -f /var/log/auth.log (on the server) and monitor errors when you attempt to login\n\n*If you have many key files, try IdentitiesOnly yes to limit the authentication to use the single, specified key.\n\n\nA: Sometimes the issue comes from permissions and ownership. For instance, if you want to log in as root, /root, .ssh and authorized_keys must belong to root. Otherwise, sshd won't be able to read them and therefore won't be able to tell if the user is authorized to log in. \nIn your home directory:\nchown -R your_user:your_user .ssh\n\nAs for rights, go with 700 for .ssh and 600 for authorized_keys\nchmod 700 .ssh\nchmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\nA: If all else failed, check that your login user belongs to the ssh's AllowedGroup. That is, your users is a member of the group shown at the following line in /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server:\nAllowGroups ssh #Here only users of 'ssh' group can login\n\n\nA: For those Putty users like me who came to this thread, you may also get this error if you forgot to add user user@Ip !\nOthers being permission on key file chmod to 600)\nssh 1.1.1.1 -i /path/to/.pem file \nPermission denied (publickey).`\n\nssh user@1.1.1.1 -i /path/to/.pem file \n\n\nA: I had the same problem as described in the question. The output from executing ssh -vvv -i id_rsa [youruser]@[yourLinode] on the client machine was similar to that described in the question. I checked all the file and directory permissions as advised in the other answers, and they were correct.\nIt turned out that when copying the generated file id_rsa.pub to the server machine, as file ~username/.ssh/authorized_keys, I'd accidentally omitted the word ssh-rsa from the start. Adding it solved the problem.\n\nA: I had added a wrong key to the server. Because I did not use the command with an option to specify a certain key it added the standard key-file.\nMake sure you did use ssh-copy-id -i CORRECT_KEY.pub\nThis wrong key worked great with one client, because this client also had this key. But when trying to connect with another client to the same server it obviously failed.\nAlso, which might be interesting is that you get more logging with ssh -vv instead of just the single -v.\n\nA: Owner permission for the ~/.ssh directory, should contain your username.\nchown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/.ssh\n\nNote: Make sure $USER is your correctly username (not root).\n\nA: Another causes for this error are:\n\n*\n\n*Incorrect user in ssh -i id_rsa [user]@[yourLinode]\n\n*Outdated SSH RSA key. OpenSSH v8 deprecated RSA algorithm by default.\nRegenerate your keys with: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/your.key -C \"My key\"\n\nThis might be the case especially if you're getting the possible debug warning:\ndebug1: send_pubkey_test: no mutual signature algorithm\n\nHere is the good article that describes possible issues for this error: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-fix-permission-denied-errors/\nOther references:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen#ssh-keys-and-public-key-authentication\n\n*https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserverkb/ssh-rsa-key-rejected-with-message-no-mutual-signature-algorithm-1026057701.html\n\nA: In my case the issue was caused by copying over an .ssh directory from an older machine. Turns out that my older SSH config was using DSA keys which have since been deprecated. Switching to a new pair of keys, this time RSA-based, solved the problem for me.\n", "Q: What happens when I cancel a Deja Dup backup? Recently I had a reason to cancel a Deja Dup backup an hour later after it started. Now I wonder whether it messed up anything on the backup destination (AS3 storage)?\n\nA: The worst that will happen is that some extra backup files will sit in the backup location until your next backup.\nThere are three ways a backup can end prematurely.  Cancel, Resume Later, or being interrupted (like shutdown or loss of Internet).  In the first case, Deja Dup will clean up any partial backup it might have left before closing.  In the latter two cases, the files will be left, and it will try to resume the backup where it left off the next time it is run.\n\nA: It doesn't give an indication it continues with the previous backup, but that's what it does. I confirmed by looking at the names/dates of the files in the backup location\n", "Q: Boot from cd drive in GRUB2 How can I add a GRUB2 menu entry to boot from my cd drive? Would I have to chainload it, or is there another way of doing it?\n\nA: GRUB2 itself doesn't have support to boot from CD, but it supports booting from ISO files.  You could copy the ISO of the CD you want to boot from, to the hard drive and then create a custom grub entry.\nNow with Grub, they say its might be possible.  This method is applicable for all legacy PCs which can’t boot from CDROM drive.  It requires the use of memdisk.bin, and sbootmgr.dsk.  For instructions, see Boot CDROM through GRUB.\nThe links to download sbootmgr, and memdisk no longer works.  But you can download them by clicking on their respective links.\nsbootmgr.dsk, and memdisk.bin\n", "Q: Clearing caches in ubuntu I need to clear system cache in order to record the time taken by a postgres query in cold cache. For clearing the system cache I am executing the following commands as root on Ubuntu server 12.04:\nsync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\nsync; echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\nsync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nI am running the following SQL commands along with clearing caches:\n1. select col1 from my_table;  //Time Taken= 3000 ms\n2. sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n   sync; echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n   sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n3. Now again running the same select command and clearing caches:\n   select col1 from my_table;  //Time Taken= 200 ms\n4. sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n   sync; echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n   sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n5. Now again running the same select command and clearing caches:\n   select col1 from my_table;  //Time Taken= 10 ms\n\nFrom what I can interpret from the reduced query execution time is, even after clearing the caches, in effect caches are not getting cleared. Is my interpretation correct? Is there some other way of clearing caches in Ubuntu 12.04 server?\n\nA: I think you've made a bad assumption. With the drop_caches interface you can clear the caches that are managed by the kernel, but that doesn't reset all userspace processes back to their previous state.\nThe SQL server is probably caching some intermediate results, or maybe even the final result of the query, in its own memory. Or maybe it has dynamically adjusted its execution plan for the query based on statistics gathered during the first 2 runs.\nYou can partially compensate by restarting the daemon, but with a complex system like an SQL server, it's going to be really hard to exactly reproduce any previous state other than \"freshly installed\". Unless you snapshot the entire machine.\n", "Q: How can I install Uniscan on Ubuntu 13.04?

I want to add a custom bookmark to Nautilus's/Ubuntu's File Manager's sidebar, right under:\nPlaces\nAs opposed to adding it right under\nBookmarks\n\n\nA: You can't simply add a new location to Places like you add to Bookmarks. This because those locations are hardcoded into Nautilus. You can change the name or location of the directories or you can hide the directories by pointing them to Home by editing ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs file, but you can't add new locations.\nSo, to add a new location to Places you have to edit the Nautilus source code.

I know that if I want to use Ubuntu aside Windows 7, I'll have to partition the drives, but I don't actually know about partitioning. This is very new. I want to ask something. How should I partition my drives?\nI currently have this sort of configuration:\nWhat I want to do:\n1. No changes to /dev/sda3 (ANKITA) (That's somebody else's)\n2. Utilize 5 GB from /dev/sda2 and 15 GB from /dev/sda4 and that unallocated space\n3. So, I want to use 20 GB to get some Ubuntu experience.  \nHow to do this? What are the possible dangerous outcomes?\n(I'm sick of using Ubuntu from LIVECD)\nThanks a lot.\nUPDATE:\nI now have a better situation. I've formatted sda3 and now I want to install Ubuntu inside that drive. How do I proceed?\n\n\nA: Using Gparted always involves the possibility of losing all the data on that drive or partition. You wont harm the hardware of the drive with standard operations though. You should always back up your data before using Gparted\nWith Gparted you can just click the move/resize button with the partition you want selected. Then modify the before and after spaces next to the partition. \nIf it were me doing this, I would backup the partitions that you want to modify. Then format them and then just install everything from scratch. Resizing partitions is more complicated than its worth in my opinion. \n\nA: Splinter701 gave a pretty good answer, keep his'/hers in mind. I'm gonna try to be a bit more specific to your situation. \nIf you resize sda2 and sda4 you end up with two unallocated spaces, so you have to move sda3 to get one unallocated space were you can create a new partition. The problem is that this involves a lot of resizing and moving of partitions and as Splinter701 suggested it is better to recreate them.\nA good rule of thump is to avoid resizing and/or moving of partitions, since this takes a long time and can cause problems and frustration. \n\n\n*\n\n*If there is nothing important on a partition, just remove it and make\na new one.\n\n*If you do have important stuff on the partition, make\nsure to make a backup before resizing. (Always backup before changing\nyour partition table)\n\n*And now you have a backup there is no reason\nto not recreate your partition...\n\n\n\nPrimary partitions, extended partitions, and logical partitions\nAs you mentioned, you already have four primary partitions and can't create a fifth. To solve this, delete one partition (lets say sda4) and create an extended partition in the unallocated space that you just created. Inside this extended partition you can recreate sda4 and make any other partition you need (as logical partitions).\nIf you're confused by the words 'primary' 'extended' and 'logical' you should read this question about the subject. It has some pretty good answers.\n.\n", "Q: My computer shows 6 boot options instead of 2 I installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside with my Windows 7 this morning.\nThe installation was ok but there are 6 choices appearing on my boot options when I boot up.\nit was like this:\nUbuntu (blah blah blah... this is the one i choose when I want to boot Ubuntu)\nUbuntu (blah blah blah...)\nCheck memory\ncheck memory\nwindows 7 (which I choose to boot windows 7)\nwindows 7 (blah blah)\n\nA: The other ones are recovery and memory test options.

However after a fresh install Youtube is still not working.\nIs there anyone who knows how to fix this?\nEdit: I created a virtual machine running Windows XP using VirtualBox and it too did not play youtube videos.\n\nA: Its a possibility that your flash player pluggins are incompatible. You can visit the Ubuntu software center to locally install the flash plug in for your browsers or you can enter the command Enter \"sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\" and type your password into the terminal. Enter \"y\" when it asks you if you want to install it and wait for it to install.\n", "Q: ant not working on Ubuntu 12.10 I have installed ant on my ubuntu 12.10.

I installed kwin yesterday, using this command:\nsudo atp-get install kde-window-manager\nthen I thought it didnt work, so I also did this command, then rebooted\nsudo apt-get install kde-workspace-bin\nnow it did work.\nHowever I really want to remove it because I lack disk space.\nHow do I completely remove kwin, to ubuntu basics.\nSo that the login screen is back to the original ubuntu login screen and I have more freed disk space.\nI tried \nsudo atp-get remove kde-window-manager\nand\nsudo apt-get remove kde-workspace-bin\nthe login screen is still different from the original ubuntu login screen, and I gained a mere ~12mb disk space instead of ~110mb used for kwin.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: All packages installed as a result of being dependencies of the ones you have installed manually, are still marked as installed automatically. Run\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nto remove the packages not listed as \"required\" anymore on your system.\nSo, basically, let's say that the installation of package-a requires package-b, then removing package-a does not remove package-b as well. By running apt-get autoremove, it will notice that there's no requrement anymore for package-b and it will offer to remove it.\n\n\nthe login screen is still different from the original ubuntu login screen\n\nThat's probably because you pulled in kdm, the KDE display manager and login screen. Remove it as well if the previous command didn't do that already:\nsudo apt-get remove kdm\n\n", "Q: How to mount a Windows share using Deja-Dup and a NAS Device configured by a WinXP machine? I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed on my main laptop and my old machine runs Win XP.  The Win XP machine configures a Buffalo LS-XL65F Network Attached Storage device.   \nI'm having a problem with Deja-Dup and backing up my Ubuntu Home folder to the NAS Device.  When I try to configure Deja-Dup to connect to the NAS device (which is configured on the Windows XP machine), I always get the error message, \"Failed to Mount Windows Share\".   \nI can mount the NAS Windows Share using Nautilus file browser and copy the files to the NAS manually, but I would like configure Deja-Dup to do it regularly, on a weekly basis.   \nI'm not sure if was necessary or not, but I downloaded and installed Samba, and tried to configure that.\nI'm guessing there must be something wrong with my syntax in Deja-Dup.  I'm also no expert in Linux.   The syntax I'm using looks like this:\n\nIs there something obvious that I'm doing wrong?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I am new to Ubuntu Linux myself, but I would like to post what worked for me. I use a Linkstation Live by Buffalo as my NAS. The name of my station is the model, which is LS-XLC5D. When I created my folder on the NAS I wanted to back up to, I set it up with support for Windows, Apple, and FTP. \nOn Linux, in Deja-Dup under Storage I set Windows Share to be the backup location. I put the IP address of the NAS in the Server field. I put the name of the folder in the Folder field. I left username blank, and put WORKGROUP in the Domain field (you would probably have MSHOME from the look of it).\nFrom this, when I tried to do the backup, it asked me for my username and password, which is the same as if you were logging into the web configuration panel (default is admin/password I believe). Then it asked if I wanted to encrypt the backup and it ran successfully.\nThe main thing for me was not to use the name of the Linkstation as the server; use the IP address. I got that tip from this website. \nI also suppose it will be of great help to set the IP of your NAS to be static. That way if you unplug the NAS and restart the router it won't change the IP address, otherwise you would have to go into backup settings and manually enter the new IP. But that worked for me. Also, I did not need to install Samba at all to get this to work.\nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: lock screen periodically for some time For the sake of caring about eyes I would like my screen to be blocked e.g. every  hour for  5 minutes (or another intervals).  \nOnce I used one programme for doing it, but  now I can't recall its name.\nDoes someone know programmes that can help to get such functionality?\n\nA: To lock the screen, you can follow the answer to this post.\nSo you would write a script (in GEdit) containing:\n#!/bin/sh\n#: filename: lock-script\n\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\ngnome-screensaver-command -l\n\nand save it in your home folder (or you could create a new directory for it).\nIf you only one to black out your display (without locking) change the -l switch for -a.\nMake your script executable running chmod 744 /home/your-username/lock-script.\nThen execute the following\necho '15 * * * * /home/your-username/lock-script' | crontab\n\nNow lock-script will be executed 15 minutes after the start of every hour on every day.

Last but not least, no updates were made​​.\nAny idea?\n\nA: Your system was likely not attacked. Teamviewer starts with the system by default (annoying I know, but true anyway) in the latest version I've tried.\nThe solution is to check both startup programs, and the following locations:\n/home/rolandixor/.config/autostart\n/usr/share/autostart\n\nfor an entry for Teamviewer, and if it exists, to remove it.\nYou were likely logged out due to a Xserver crash (this occasionally happens when watching videos or playing games, especially on proprietary drivers in my experience).

Unfortunately, I restarted my system, hoping that Unity \"UI\" would be loaded, but there's no Unity UI preinstalled!\nI'm using GRUB bootloader, Ubuntu is installed with Windows 7 Pro 32 Bit(But on other partition, of course). Also, I have my preinstalled apps, and I'm just using Ubuntu for about this day only(Yeah, you can call me a noob or whatever).\nIn short, I can boot Ubuntu properly, but I can't log in. I tried to do a recovery, but I aborted it (foolish, huh?).\nDo I have to do a reinstallation of the OS? Or I should type commands in GRUB bootloader (if possible)?\nI'm sorry for my long story, and wrong grammars(if there are :D). Do you know any solutions? Quick responses are VERY appreciated.\n\nA: If I understand your problem, you tried to remove Gnome Desktop and now you have no login screen so you cannot log in.\nNot sure what command you might have used but alot of Gnome programs are a dependant of the Unity desktop.\nYou should still be able to log into Ubuntu using the terminal as you say you can still boot.\nAfter booting press Ctrl+Alt+F1 this should get you to tty 1. If so enter your username and the press enter.  Enter your password at the prompt note that you will not see any response to your keypress but they will still register(this is a security feature).\nAfter you enter your password press enter and you should be greeted with a line that has your username and the computer name followed by ~$  if so you have successfully log in to Ubuntu but with not Desktop environment. We can now try to reinstall a DE to use.\nType this into the terminal sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop  This should install the Unity desktop as well as any dependencies that you may have deleted when you tried to remove Gnome.\nIf successful you should be able to restart and use your Unity Desktop.  To restart type sudo reboot into the terminal and your computer will reboot just like you had done so from the UI.\nIf you still get no login screen restart and log into the terminal and type sudo apt-get install lightdm unity-greeter\nI think these are installed when you install ubuntu-deskop but I was unable to verify that.  You can install them at the same time you install the desktop if you want, they will not reinstall if you already have the latest version and will give you a warning as such but will do no damage.\nNote that this will only work if you still can connect to the internet, if you have borked your system so that you can no longer connect you may be able to install from the live media that you installed Ubuntu with but it may or may not work.  It may still be possible to get it installed by manually setting up the connection in the terminal but that is beyond my knowledge.\nNote #2  If for some reason you cannot log into Ubuntu when you press Crtl+Alt+F1 then boot to recovery mode (press Left Shift repeatedly during boot then select recovery mode with networking)  and then you should be able to follow the instructions to install ubuntu-desktop.\n\nA: You probably don't need to install the whole system again.

I'm trying to diagnose intermittent poor wifi performance on my laptop, which has a fresh installation of 13.04. \nI installed several network monitoring tools, including \"slurm\", which I'm now using to monitor both the wireless interface (wlan0) and the loopback interface (lo). The wireless interface, predictably, shows the same information displayed in the System Monitor; data generally flows at the rate of several hundred KB/second. The loopback interface, however, consistently shows a transaction speed of 5-40 KB/sec, maxing out at around 80-90. I don't really understand how Ubuntu's network interfaces work (plus the complexities of how they interact with Network Manager). Is it normal for the lo interface to be so slow? How does the loopback interface affect networking performance? Can I pretty much ignore it when trying to figure out my wifi problem?\n\nA: As soulsource already pointed out, you're probably looking at interprocess communication done over the localhost network. That isn't very efficient, but in programming this is sometimes useful to have a single piece of code whether the two components are running on the same machine or over the network. Let's have a look how to track this down.\nAs your tcpdump shows it's sending data to port 8332 on localhost, you can see what's listening there using netstat:\nsudo netstat -nlptu | grep 8332\n\n(-n for numeric output, -l for listening sockets, -p to show the process, -t and -u to show both TCP and UDP sockets.)\nYou should see something like \ntcp   0      0 127.0.0.1:8332   0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN     21891/SomeProcessName\n\nThen investigate this process ID further:\nps u --pid 21891\n\nThis will show something like\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\ngert     21891  0.0  0.0 480768 13836 ?

First one has to increase the size of the logical volume, then one has to extend the filesystem to span the whole logical volume.\nThe size of the logical volume can be increased using the \"lvextend\" command. For different filesystems, different commands have to be used to increase their size. In case of ext{2,3,4} it's the \"resize2fs\" command.\nAn excellent guide for LVM can be found at the linux documentation project, and it has a page dedicated to extending of a logical volume.\n", "Q: Poor Wifi Signal Strength I have a Ralink RT 3290 802.11 bgn adapter & a DLink N600 router.

But I can see full bars on my neighbour's security protected network, which is farther away and through more walls. Is there any way to get my HP laptop to get better signal, or get my router to transmit better? \n\nA: You could try a parabolic reflector. Check out this Parabolic Template;\nhttp://fleamour.wordpress.com/2012/10/21/parabolic-reflector/\nUsing just printable white card, tin foil, scissors, a craft knife & Pritt Stick, you can improve your wireless reception.  The tin foil only needs gluing to rectangular section alone.  Mounted to your routers aerial (or x2 or even x3 aerials) you should see a measurable increase in reception.  You can use one such utility like Wicd (installable from standard repos) under Ubuntu for measuring link strength.\nI found it makes all the difference between a rock solid connection in bedroom with door closed & not even detecting a network at all!

So, I just set it randomly. Now when I open the Home folder I cannot see any of the logical drives on the left pane.

However it doesn't work if I use tabs (from an open terminal `CTRL+SHIFT+T) rather than new windows. Why this difference in behaviour? How can I share the bash history also among various tabs?\nUPDATE: I noticed an unusual behaviour: if I type CTRL+C then the last command typed in any of the other terminals (both a tab or not) is correctly displayed. It is like if the CTRL+C forces a flush of the history so that then it is correctly shared.\nAs an example the outputs (T1 denotes terminal 1 and T2 terminal 2):\nT1:\nls -lah <enter>\n# the list of files and directory is shown\n\nT2:\ncd Documents <enter>\n\nT1:\n<up> (i.e. I press the up arrow)\nls -lah #i.e the last command in terminal 1 is shown rather than the last of terminal 2\n^C (i.e. I press CTRL+C)\n<up>\ncd Documents #the last command issued in terminal 2 is correctly displayed\n\nHope this can offer any hint!\n\nA: It looks like you're trying to access the other terminal's history before the sync takes place. PROMPT_COMMAND is executed right before a new prompt is printed, i.e., after you run a command and before you type the next command. So it won't happen right away in T1; you have to cause a new prompt to be displayed.\nTo test this, try this variant on your steps (I added an extra <enter> in T1):\nT1:\nls -lah <enter>\n# the list of files and directory is shown\n\nT2:\ncd Documents <enter>\n\nT1:\n<enter>\n<up> (i.e. I press the up arrow)\n\nWith this extra press of enter, you get a new prompt, which runs PROMPT_COMMAND and syncs your history, and so I would expect this up arrow to retrieve the cd instead of the ls, as you wanted. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to make the sync happen instantaneously in all terminals without running any commands as you seem to want; effectively this would require all of your login sessions to be synchronizing their history lists continuously all the time, which would be a huge waste of CPU and disk throughput.\n\nA: I asked the same question and here is the answer I came up with.... \nHISTSIZE=9000\nHISTFILESIZE=$HISTSIZE\nHISTCONTROL=ignorespace:ignoredups\n\nhistory() {\n  _bash_history_sync\n  builtin history \"$@\"\n}\n\n_bash_history_sync() {\n  builtin history -a         #1\n  HISTFILESIZE=$HISTSIZE     #2\n  builtin history -c         #3\n  builtin history -r         #4\n}\n\nPROMPT_COMMAND=_bash_history_sync\n\n\nA: add that lines to your .bashrc file \n# avoid duplicates..\nexport HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:erasedups  \n# append history entries..\nshopt -s histappend\n\ntrap 'history -r' USR1 \nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a ; history -c; ps a | awk '/ bash$/ {system (\\\"kill -USR1 \\\" \\$1)}'; $PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\nnote: \nInitially I did my test bay sending USR1 signal to bash with killall, later I thought to use a uniquee shell name, a bash copy named testshell, to avoid killing my own shells that could run (cron processes for instance) but strangelly that was not working.\nThe killall was not selective enough, I  replaced it with a script that kills only the bash processes tight to a tty (ps a reports only processes tied to a tty)\nDo not forget to restart your session to have a fresh PROMPT_COMMAND, when I was testing I saw many of my previous test stacked inside PROMPT_COMMAND.\n\nA: I had the same strange behavior in Yakuake when tried to create elaborate bash prompt which would show the number of another logins. Number didn't increase for tabs.\nMy workaround was to tell Yakuake run bash again in every new tab, essentially starting bash in bash. It started to work flawlessly. May be it would help you too.\nMy blind guess is that GUI for console loads bash configs itself and then feeds them to bash instances. May be it is to be able to fiddle with them. \n", "Q: how can I install wine 1.4 on ubuntu 13.04?

I also put a 24gb linux swap partition at the start of the HDD, though I figure this won't be used all that much (the laptop has 8gb of RAM).\nAfter googling around and reading Ask Ubuntu and other sites extensively, I have done the following steps, and they have improved the battery life ~30 minutes (exact improvement not clear, but battery life is still nowhere near 4-5 hours).\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Jupiter (and set Performance to \"Power Saving\")\n\n*Installed laptop-mode-tools\n\n\n*\n\n*cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode now outputs 5 (previously it output 0)\n\n*But it's not clear that this will help: AskUbuntu question\n\n\n*Turned down the brightness of my screen from full to 1/3\n\n\nOther things I have heard about but have not tried for fear of frying the laptop or my linux install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add \"pcie_aspm=force\" at the end of the line with \"quiet splash\" in /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n*Enable ALPM, but it may already be enabled in 12.04?\n\n*Enable i915 framebuffer compression\n\n*Use a propietary driver for the graphics card?

According to Jupiter my CPU temperature is only 69 celsius and the System Monitor shows CPU load at 7% so I don't think it's the CPU. Maybe it's the graphics card?\nAlso, I've set up MongoDB and LAMP on the machine as well.

It is one of the benefits of the FLOSS community that there are licenses available that have been extensively checked by lawyers. And you could still consider using one of those, I will get back to that later.\nYou always should at the very least include your copyright notice which must be written in the form copyright symbol year name. The name must be a legal entity, which could be you personally, but it could also be your company (if it has been legally registered etc). It is unwise to assign copyright to a group name that has no legal status.\nAdding a suitable End User License Agreement (EULA) in proprietary software is important for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must have asserted somewhere that people are buying (licensing) the use of your software, and not buying the code, intellectual property rights etc. If you do not mention this it would be unclear.\n\n*You must have included disclaimers that whatever happens through the use of your software, you are not liable for any damages.\n\n*You must have included some level of support (usually along the lines of: \"you buy the software as-is and we may give or sell you updates later\"). \n\n\nThis is off the top of my head (and I am not a lawyer!), but you can see why that is important and why it needs to be in proper legalese just in case something goes wrong or one of your customers has malicious intent. It depends a little bit on what kind of software you are going to put in the market, but in general it is better to be safe than sorry. A EULA is there to protect you from the customer (read one by Microsoft or Apple just to get an idea). And they can be complex and risky to draft without the assistance of a lawyer.\nThere are a number of places where you can buy and download a EULA from online law-firm (or websites claiming to be), but unless you hire your own lawyer, you would still need to sift through the text carefully to make sure that all the different stipulations apply to you. The next best thing is to use what is available in the FLOSS world and modify them slightly so that you can serve your customers.\nSo coming back to the open source licenses: you can use one of the FLOSS licenses available and make modifications for paying customers, such as giving them permission for commercial use. The creative commons website is most clear on this (look at their explanation of \"waivers\"). You can do this because you are the owner (copyright holder) and you can set terms for you customers, something nobody else can do for your software and code. The Creative commons even have a variation of their licenses for this purpose: the creative commons plus license.\nWhatever you do, take your time to think things through and read a lot before actually putting it out on the market. Asking Canonical for a standard Ubuntu EULA would also be helpful, maybe they have this and it would certainly make their software center more interesting.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One startup on Mac Ubuntu One is installed on my MacBook, OS X Lion, and appears to be working fine, other than it does not appear to load automatically at startup.\nPlease note that Connect automatically when computer starts is selected.\nIs there a way to set this up, other than including it as a Login item under the User & Groups in System Preferences? Which is what I have implemented in the interim. (I have Hide ticked so that one does not see the Ubuntu One gui pop up every time one logs in).\nBut I suspect that there may be a more elegant way of implementing the Ubuntu One start up.\n\nA: sorry for the confusion. So, this is actually two bugs.\nFirst, the preference box is labelled confusingly wrong. It does not mean \"start syncing when you log into your computer\". It means \"start syncing when the Ubuntu One background sync program starts\". The Ubuntu One background sync program, called ubuntuone-syncdaemon, is intended to be running all the time, and this preference is for people who want to manually control when it uses the network. I recommend you keep it on.\nSecond, the mac client does not currently add itself to the login items list, so it will not start at login unless you add it there manually. Adding it manually is exactly the right way to solve your problem, because that is all that a fixed version will do anyway.\n", "Q: Error after installing Ubuntu 13.04 I recently installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my Lenovo G580.\nSo everything went alright, then I installed Kubuntu to try it out, and it was pretty laggy then I uninstalled it so everything got messed up and I got confused, So I just decided to format Ubuntu and install it again.\nAfter I installed it and rebooted, I got an error message saying: \"Ubuntu is blocked by the current security policy.\".\nCan I get some helps?\n\nA: Preface\nI believe that you are installing Ubuntu over an existing installation, without cleaning up/re-partitioning your HDD/SSD.\nFormating Partitions using LiveCD\nYou can do the following in Ubuntu's LiveCD after installing gparted, but I prefer to use Parted Magic.

I seem to have a problem with the recent touch release. I can't access the keyboard in the wireless application, however it does appear in Notes. I have restarted my Nexus 7 several times and it still has not appeared. I, to be honest, am wondering if I have done anything wrong. Unfortunately there is nothing message wise from system, which, frankly doesn't seem right, so debug info isn't included. Can anyone enlighten our community? I am using Lubuntu raring to install, if it helps.\n\nA: I have also experienced this, only on the nexus 4. It appears to be a bug with the saucy builds. I found a work around though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a laptop that has the Ubuntu SDK installed. It must be on wifi, not ethernet.\n\n*Open the Ubuntu SDK\n\n*Under the tab where it says Devices, click on Clone network config from host to device\nThis will, as the button says, clone the network configuration to the device. Of course, If you are traveling, you willl need that laptop to be first connected to the Network you want to connect to, then repeat those steps. So this is not practical if you are on the go and you need wifi, but great for connect to your home network.\nHope this works.\n", "Q: virtualhost problem I used to add virtual hosts no problem in httpd.conf. \nNow with splitting up vhosts into separate files something's wrong: I could only get the first of the vhosts in sites-enabled to appear. Eventually I found a solution I don't like, that works on my local linux boxes, but not on my Amazon AWS Ubuntu server. (the reason I don't like it is that I'd like to do it by making separate files, like the guides say to do it, minimizing potential problems if something is typed wrong, and I want it to work both local and remote.)\nHere's what I did that ended up working locally: I added the following to the end of the apache2.conf file (copied idea from http://www.techstaty.com):\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName example1\nDocumentRoot /var/www/example1\nErrorLog /var/www/logs/error_log\nCustomLog /var/www/logs/custom common\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName exampletwo\nDocumentRoot /var/www/exampletwo\nErrorLog /var/www/logs/error_log\nCustomLog /var/www/logs/custom common\n</VirtualHost>\n\nupdating /etc/hosts file:\n127.0.0.1 localhost example1 exampletwo \n\nworks fine.\nThe reason I don't like it is that I don't understand why not putting them in separate files in sites-available, then a2ensite example1, ditto for exampletwo, and a2dissite default, then restarting the server, doesn't make my two virtual hosts work. I read that if you always get the first alphabetical virtual server no matter which host you request, the server is confused. \nSo how do I test to figure out what's wrong? Why does it work on my two local ubuntu boxes (12.10 & 12.04), but not on the Amazon AWS Ubuntu 12.04 instance?\napache2ctl configtest says: Syntax OK. and restarting apache2ctl graceful shows no errors. I've also checked the access & error logs w/o gaining insight.\nI also tried: a2enmod vhosts_alias but that made no difference. (I figure my problem is prior to someone trying: www.ex... rather than: example1.)\n\nA: This worked for me on Rackspace.\nTo set up two domains as separate virtual hosts. I modified the virtual hosts attribute to\n<VirtualHost example1:80>\nServerName example1\nDocumentRoot /var/www/example1\nErrorLog /var/www/logs/error_log\nCustomLog /var/www/logs/custom common\n</VirtualHost>\n\nSimilarly, I edited the second virtual host to exampletwo:80\nIf this doesn't work, you can also try adding NameVirtualHosts in ports.conf.\n", "Q: How can drag music to my apple iPhone 4s I want to know how to drag and sync all my apple devices to linux because i already tried using Rythymbox,Banshee,Clementine,etc.... \n\nA: There are other apps you can use. Dropbox has a music player that will play music from dropbox, and there's a dropbox app for iPhone. There are other apps that will play from other cloud storage services that work with the iPhone. But Apple just doesn't seem to want to work with Linux - probably some conflict between their business model of charging for air and sunlight when they can and the Open Source community's dislike of proprietary formats and DRM.\n", "Q: How do I install Red5 using apt-get?

Installed Flumotion instead and cannot tell that I have more success with it.\nNevertheless it would be nice if someone finally give us the real answer to the question.\n\nA: Installing a server has nothing to do with luck. Either it works or not. Software isn't magic. For this reason, first force to finish the installation, because with a broken package system you can't install other needed packages, if they are needed.\nAfter that, you can solve the server start problem. \n\nIn a fresh Ubuntu 15.10 Wily (VM) installation is nothing more to do than\nsudo apt-get install red5-server\n\nAll needed dependencies will be installed correctly.

If there is this line\nset -e\n\nreplace with\n# set -e\n\nand run\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nor find, where the server will be started, something like \ninvoke-rc.d red5-server start\n\nand comment out the start procedure. And run\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nThen you'll need to find out why the server fails to start, but the installation can be completed.\n\nA: Quick way\nHere is the closed upstream bug report: Installation fails on Ubuntu 14.04 #29 seem the deb package is not updated and the original author suggest using the upstream tarball. He also mentioned:\n\nIf anyone knows how to update the .deb stuff, let us know and we will take care of it.\n\nFollow the accepted answer in Ubuntu Trusty red5-server installation fails to start which contains the instructions to install the upstream package.\n\nThe problem was due failing to start service:\nStarting Flash streaming server : red5-server failed!\ninvoke-rc.d: initscript red5-server, action \"start\" failed.\n\nAs mentioned in A.B.'s answer #set -e is the quickest solution to let installation complete as it possible to comment only the service related commands in postinst script:\n#invoke-rc.d red5-server start || exit $?\n\n\nAs 12.10/13.04 are not LTS and no longer supported here.

(i.e. nothing appeared to have changed from a boot perspective)\n\n*Ran boot-repair off Ubuntu CD & received Locked-ESP detected error message\n\n*Saw this site: hxxp://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2112273.html, so removed the boot flag for /dev/sda1 & restarted with the intention of following the rest of the steps.\n\n*Nothing now loads.   Following message displays on load:  No boot device available SATA0: Installed. SATA1: Installed.\n\n*I tried going to legacy boot but ultimately switched back to UEFI as I didn't think it was accomplishing anything\n\n*I have also disabled SECURE Boot in the BIOS --- with no perceived affect.\n\n*I also tried setting gparted boot flag to the ubuntu partition vice Windows partition with no affect.\n\n\nI'm kind of lost here, as this is beyond my technical knowledge -- so any assistance or tips would be greatly appreciated.  \nHere is my pastebin from bootrepair:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5794027/\n\nA: First, understand that under EFI/UEFI, the computer stores boot loaders on a partition known as an EFI System Partition (ESP). This partition holds a FAT32 filesystem and is identified by a particular partition type code, which parted, GParted, and similar libparted-based tools identify as having the \"boot flag\" set. Thus, when you removed the \"boot flag\" from your ESP, you damaged the disk, and setting the \"boot flag\" on a Linux or Windows exacerbated this problem. These actions are probably why your computer stopped booting anything. You should use GParted to re-set the \"boot flag\" on the ESP and remove it from all other partitions. Your Boot Repair output shows this set correctly, so my guess is that you've either already done this or your Boot Repair output was taken before you altered your boot flags. (Your post isn't clear on when the Boot Repair output was taken.)\nSecond, I'm not entirely sure what the \"locked ESP\" message you referred to means; I've never encountered this myself, and I don't recall hearing of it, either. My guess is that it refers to a partition having a read-only flag set, but I'm not positive of that. If I'm right, this flag can be removed with gdisk (installed from a package of the same name): Type x to get to the experts' menu, then type a to adjust flags. This will show the flags (in an admittedly crude user interface); near the bottom, you'll see:\nAttribute value is 1000000000000000. Set fields are:\n60 (read-only)\n\nIf you don't see that 60 (read-only) line, then hit the Enter key followed by q to quit without saving. If this line is present, though, type 60 to toggle the flag off, then hit Enter, then hit w to save your changes.\nDisabling Secure Boot could be helpful, or even necessary; but disabling EFI-mode booting or enabling legacy-mode booting will be unhelpful.\nYou might try downloading the CD-R or USB flash drive image of rEFInd and burning/writing it to a suitable medium. You might then be able to boot that medium to get a working boot manager, which should enable you to boot Linux. If that works, then installing the rEFInd Debian package from within your booted system may get rEFInd working from your hard disk, without help from an external medium. If rEFInd works from the external medium but not from the hard disk installation, then you've got a buggy firmware. Numerous specific bugs can cause this general symptom. The most general solution is to rename your boot loaders so that rEFInd launches instead of the Windows boot loader. This is described in the rEFInd documentation, and Ubuntu's Boot Repair does something similar with GRUB. Some computer manufacturers make things even harder, though, by creating their own boot partitions -- manufacturer-specific variants on the ESP. Your Boot Repair output makes it look like your computer may have such a partition (/dev/sda2), but Boot Repair hasn't found any boot loader files on that partition. Thus, it's not clear what, if any, extra steps would have to be taken on your system because of this. Finding all the files with names that end in .efi or .EFI on that partition might provide some clues about that. \n\nA: I had a \"Locked-ESP detected\" error message from Boot-Repair when I ran it with Recommended Repair settings from within an Ubuntu Live USB (as explained in the 2nd option on the Boot-Repair wiki page).\nI then started gParted and unmounted all my partitions (by right-clicking on them one by one and selecting \"unmount\").\nAfter that, I ran Boot-Repair again from within the Ubuntu Live USB, again Recommended Repair, and it was succesfull in repairing my system.\n(See also in longer here).\nThe problem appeared to be simply that my partitions were mounted when using Boot-Repair.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 'brightness and lock' not working!

It finished OK with a message about needing to restart for the changes to be effective.\nToday I have 3 issues:\nThe first is that network manager is misbehaving.  The network icon is 2 little arrows.\nHovering over it gives the help text: Networking disabled.\nClicking on it says: NetworkManager is not running... and a right click shows a limited menu (3 lines) with only one option not greyed out: Edit connections.\nIf I check with service network-manager start, it says start: Job is already running: network-manager. I tried to stop then, restart. The networking icon hasn't changed, but the messages are different: Hovering over it is still the same (networking disabled) but with left click it says No network devices are available (in grey) and I can click on VPN connections. While on right click it gives the same menu as previously, but now the greyed out Enable networking has a tick in front of it.\nI searched online, and the closest I found was this. Although I am not running Mate.\nThe second problem is that when I click on the Shutdown icon I get an error window: \nUnable to perform shutdown\nShutdown command failed  \n\nAnd I can only click on Quit or hit enter, which brings me to a login screen. Attempts to shutdown from there fail too. I can however shutdown by typing sudo shutdown -P 0 in a Terminal.\nFinally, the USB ports do not work, in as much as I cannot mount anything inserted.

As I only noticed this last issue after posting my original question I will go and search online some more to see if I can revert to the pre-upgrade situation without going online nor using a USB port.\nMany thanks\nanne\n\nA: OK, I am a fool.\nThe solution was to run Update Manager again.  It complained about some half-unpacked packages then about the lack of internet connection so that the update could not be completed.

He knows my password. Do let me know any way to stop this killing process. I know that changing the password will be the solution. But I want to know the other ways to stop it. He is doing it via SSH.\n\nA: Since your friend is connecting via SSH:\nBlocking the IP address might be a bad idea, i assume that you have some DHCP server running in your LAN -> the attacker's IP address will change eventually. \nYou could also block him based on the MAC address, that will however only work when he is connecting from the same sub-net.\nI recommend you to change the password, since that is the root of the problem.\nAs an alternative you could disallow your own user to login via ssh and create a new user that you use for connecting to your computer. Of course you must not give that users's password to that friend of yours, that's self explaining. (Once connected with the new user you can use the su command to switch into your original user)\nThere are of course a lot of other solutions for your problem, but i really suggest you just to change the password.\nUpdate\nTo disable SSH access edit sshd_config (vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config) and\nsearch for DenyUsers. If there is no such entry add it in a new line, so will end up with the following: DenyUsers <the-username-to-block>\nNow restart the sshd daemon : sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart\nNow add a new user with adduser <some-new-name>. Once connected with the new user use su <your original username> to switch into your original user's context.\n\nA: The other way is to stop the ssh daemon, which disables remote logins to the machine, so be careful about that.\nsudo service ssh stop\n\nHowever, changing your password is better.\n\nA: Use UFW GUI to turn on firewall, then block all network connections to his IP. \n", "Q: keylogging using ubuntu 1 My 13 year old son has Latitude 2100 netbook driven by Ubuntu 1.\nWe are concerned he is being bullied online, therefore I have downloaded the keylogging patch from the website to monitor his activity\nHowever I can find no information as to if this is the case or how I access his activity.

You can use whatever you want in the back. Also, I would recommend reading through the developer page. It provides a lot of useful information. Application requirements can be found here.

I’ve just installed and configured a minimal KDE distro based on the Ubuntu 13.04 minimal CD. It’s working really well but I have 1 gripe with it.\nAfter installing kde-plasma-desktop gstreamer was automatically downloaded as the phonon backend, which was fine as I’d just replace it with my usual vlc backend and remove phonon-backend-gstreamer.\nSo I remove phonon-backend-gstreamer, which gets removed as expected, and I’ve now got autoremove correctly advising me that some gstreamer-* libs are now not required; normal behaviour. But…autoremove is also recommending that it removes Linux-sound-base, alsa-base etc, some were also included that seemed unrelated to me, such as libsoup.\nNow I know this is not a major issue, as I don’t have to run autoremove, but it’s just bugging me why this is happening.\nWhy has a gstreamer backend got such a massive dependency list?\nThanks :)\n\nA: Well, to answer my own question, it doesn't :)\nWhat I completely failed to take into consideration when I asked this question was the important fact that I did a minimal install so lots (and I meant lots) of things were \"automatically\" added when I installed kde-plasma-desktop.

It wouldnt let me boot windows through my cd drive until I went to bios and changed it from fast boot to thorough boot. This allowed me to at least boot on my windows 7 disk. Dont know if that helps\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Ubuntu! This question is very common, especially in beginners (I did it myself once :D, so don't feel bad.) This happens when you manage to overwrite/delete the GRUB files.\nThese files are usually stored on the Ubuntu partition, so if you deleted the Ubuntu partition, you probably deleted those files too.

So, yes, it's basicly both a perfume tester and the perfume itself in one.\n\nI got some CDs from recent magazines I bought (UBuntu 13.04 and 12.10 - both 32bit), can I use these as LIVE CDs? If so how do I do that? Do I need to press a key when rebooting?\n\nYes. Put the disc of 13.04 in your PC, turn your PC off, and turn it on again. Wait a moment and a menu should appear that asks if you want to try Ubuntu without installing, or install it.\nIf not (and Windows Vista appears again), you should restart your PC again, and wait until the screen appears with Press <some button> to access boot menu. Then quickly press that key, and in the menu that appears, choose CD-ROM using the arrow keys and Enter.\nBefore installing, MAKE A BACKUP FIRST! Most installations will go flawlessly, but, like with everything, there's always the possibility of things going wrong.\nThe installation is pretty self-explanatory.\nAbout partitioning:\nThe partitioning is really easy.\nDuring installation, you can choose to install alongside Windows or install instead of Windows (WARNING: THE LATTER WILL DELETE ALL YOUR FILES STORED IN WINDOWS!!!). If you install alongside Windows, something like this will appear:\n\nJust slide the line between Windows and Ubuntu to choose how many GB's you want to reserve for Windows and for Ubuntu. Then click \"Install Now\".\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to ask them!\n\nA: To install ubuntu from a live cd you need to change your bios settings.Set your boot priority order to optical drive(you need to press F2 or F10 depending on your manufacturer before the boot logo appears).  Insert the disc and just restart.You will be  taken into the ubuntu installation.\nNow during the installation you will be asked if you want to install beside windows (select this if you want to keep vista)\nIf you don't want it select replace windows.  \nDon't forget to take backup of your data, replacing windows with ubuntu will delete all the data.\n\nA: It is worth pointing out that if you install alongside Vista you can access the Windows files via the file manager, so you may copy some files to the Ubuntu installation without loosing the originals.\nYou can always reinstall at a later date to use the whole disk when you are happy with Ubuntu or you can use \"dual boot\" with Vista if you find there is no equivalent for a Windows only file type.\n", "Q: Will removing Windows 8 and disabling secure boot cause any problems using Ubuntu?

I turned off secure boot in the bios and used Ubuntu 12.10 install disc.  I was able to install it side by side Win 8 with no problems.  At startup and I an option now that allows me to boot using the windows UEFI mode, or something similar, or just boot in Ubuntu.  Both work fine.\nRetrospectively, I don't think that I needed to turn off secure boot in the BIOS.  I am not sure what it actually did but I think Ubuntu was clever enough to figure it out for me.\n", "Q: Backports on Ubuntu Server? I'm considering migrating from Debian to Ubuntu Server. I have read several posts on this site about the differences.\nI like the 5 year support. But then I realised that on Debian I have sometimes needed later versions of packages (e.g. drush) and I've been able to install these by use of the backports repository.\nUbuntu has a backports project but this does not look offical/suitable for Ubuntu Server?\nSo does it require a full upgrade to the latest Ubuntu Server LTS (e.g. might be 14.04)?\n\nA: In general , backports on Ubuntu is as easy and reliable as backports on Debian (they tend to have the same maintainers). Support can vary a little by package. Backports are, IMO, no more or less official or supported on Ubuntu then Debian. IMO the advice on backports is very very similar between Debian and Ubuntu.\n\nBackports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and backports are provided on an as-is basis, with risk of incompatibilities with other components in Debian stable. Use with care!\nIt is therefore recommended to only select single backported packages that fit your needs, and not use all available backports.\n\nhttp://backports.debian.org/\n\nThe Backports Project is a means to provide new features to users. Because of the inherent stability risks in backporting packages, users do not get backported packages without some explicit action on their part. This generally makes backports an inappropriate avenue for fixing bugs. If a package in an Ubuntu release has a bug, it should be fixed either through the Security Update or the Stable Release Update process, as appropriate.\n\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports\nIt also depends on what you need. Some packages are going to be available in either backports or a ppa, and some you will need to build from source, which is a pain on a server (I do not like to install gcc / build-essential on a server unless absolutely necessary).\nIn general, due to the lower number of packages, upgrades on a server are easier then upgrades on a Desktop.\nIn general, I would advise you stay with LTS if at all possible on a server, but if your unique set of packages / requirements require a higher version, go with the most recent release. 14.04 is still in development and I would personally not run 14.04 on a server for anything but testing.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 13.04 Minimal on an Intel Atom D2500HN based system I'm trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 Minimal on a new Intel Atom D2500HN based system.\nThe full desktop install runs absolutely fine (but cripplingly slow) and I can get Lubuntu running from the CD without issue as well (though I haven't tried installing it).\nThe minimal installer appears to complete without issue, but when it comes to boot I just get a blank screen.\nI think it's having trouble displaying the text mode screen (I've tried switching to an alternate TTY using the Lubuntu demo and that seems to hang, however I don't know if the basic Lubuntu setup would have left the other TTY's enabled).\nDoes anyone have any advice on how I can get this to start properly?\nEDIT\nIt's also worth noting that having re-installed with SSH I can access the system fine, so everything else is obviously running fine.\n\nA: It could be 2 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*brightness: try using:\ni915.invert_brightness=1\n\nas kernel boot parameter, \n\n*If you have dual graphics, perhaps you need to blacklist the module.

To sum things up: \n\n\n*\n\n*You used the NAS directly connected with USB\n\n*You want that NAS to be shown as network drive to all the computer in the LAN\n\n*You want to install Ubuntu on the NAS?\n\n\nThe third question is the one that bugs me ;) Usually a NAS comes with some pre-installed proprietary software, my guess is that you can not install Ubuntu on the NAS.\nUsually the NAS has some sort of configuration interface, look it up in the manual, or give some more detail about the NAS you have in use.\nI thought you want to use that NAS as root filesystem for your ubuntu server, guess I am wrong, ill leave the previous answer below anyway:\n\nIll give you some hints. Yes, you can use your computer without a physical harddrive. \nTo make that work you have to use PXE in combination with a DHCP server, a TFTP server and a NFS server. I don't know if the NAS you are using has that capabilities. All in all this will be no trivial task, but it is of course possible. \nPXE is used as the first step, your bios and the network card have to support that, check the bios settings for network boot or something similar.\nThe steps are the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*PXE fetches a ip address from the DHCP server and the ip address of the availabe PXE boot server.\n\n*Once a PXE boot server is found, the data is transfered using TFTP, mainly the kernel image and the initrd.\n\n*Once the kernel has been loaded, the NFS server is used for providing the root filesystem.\n\n\nThere are some tutorials out there, i suggest you read through them and take your time to set the things up in a testing environment. You could use VirtualBox for example, the guest NICs support PXE.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Mythbuntu initial setup cannt connect to server I'm really new to linux, and I just installed mythbuntu to a standalone pc, it's all installed ok and I've logged on, and started the setup but I'm having issues.

Note: Please be careful with this as changing the wrong thing could render your OS unbootable (without some kind of recovery tools, at least)\nInstall and run EasyBCD, and choose \"BCD Backup/Repair\". Under \"Backup and Restore Bootloader Settings\", choose a folder to back up to and then click \"Backup Settings\" (this is useful in case anything goes wrong; I'd suggest doing this before making any changes from the program at all)\nThen, click \"Edit Boot Menu\". There should be two options there (in my case, \"Windows 7\" and \"Ubuntu\"). Click the one marked Ubuntu, and then click Delete at the top.

How to fix that? A little time ago, I found out, that I can create custom commandterminals with expanding the PATH-variable. Unfortunately, it gets always resettet, when I close the terminal and opens it again.\nDo you know how to fix this problem?\nBecause when I want to start a few scripts with terminalcommands, I don't want to expand the PATH-variable everytime before ...\n\nA: I understand you have some executables in one of your home folders, e.g., in ~/bin and you want to be able to execute them without always typing the full path ~/bin/my_cool_executable.\nYou already observed that entering PATH=~/bin:$PATH in your terminal made things work... but only until you close the terminal. When you open a new one, your former PATH variable gets reset to its original value. By the way, I guess you know how to, at any time, check the value of the PATH variable: like so:\necho \"$PATH\"\n\nHow to make your change permanent so that your PATH will still be the same when you reopen a new terminal? It's very easy, you just need to edit your .bashrc file. Let's use the gedit editor: In a terminal, type this:\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nThis opens up the gedit editor. Scroll to the end of the file and add this:\n# Added by me on 2013/06/24\nPATH=~/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH\n\nand save the file and quit gedit. Then close your terminal and open a new one. Now your PATH variable should have ~/bin in front of it so that your commands in ~/bin will be accessible without typing their full path.

My machine keeps 'freezing' before eventaully logging out with all the programs exiting. This is rather annoying, and I think its because I keep running out of memory.

In the meantime I have ordered 2 x 4 gig ram sticks to try and just throw hardware at the issue.\n\nA: I see that chromium-browser (your web browser) is using a lot of memory.\nWith only 1.4GB of memory available you will get into trouble soon with modern browsers and a lot of tabs open, yes. Press Shift+Esc in Chrome/Chromium to see what tab is consuming so much. See also: Chrome suddenly using too much memory, what's wrong?\nSimple tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep the amount of tabs low.\n\n*Uninstall unused browser extensions.\n\n*Avoid sites using extensions such as Adobe Flash, or use \"Click to Play\" instead of running all extensions directly.\n\n*Don't sort on the Virtual Memory column, but on the regular Memory column. (see below for why)\n\n\n\nDon't worry about the console-kit-daemon - it's only using 204 KiB of actual memory. The amount of virtual memory assigned is as it says virtual. The process just thinks it has the 1000 MiB of memory available, but isn't using it at the moment, clearly.

Sorry for the duplication.]\nI'm trying to install PyQt on Ubuntu (and within a virtualenv).

This structure lives under ~/.evolution/mail/local/. For every mail folder foo, some or all of the following files exist:\nfoo\nfoo.cmeta\nfoo.ev-summary\nfoo.ev-summary-meta\nfoo.ibex.index\nfoo.ibex.index.data    \nfoo.sbd\n\nThe file foo is just plain old mbox(5) format and you may access it (carefully, and preferably read-only) with a MUA which understands mbox format, i.e. nearly all of them. For example with 'mutt':\n$ mutt -R -f ~/.evolution/mail/local/foo\n\nYou should only do this when Evolution itself is not running. Note that any of the supplementary files can be removed and Evolution will reconstruct them next time it runs. You can also grep the file for text strings or addresses for use in the normal UNIX world.\nThe foo file contains only messages. If the foo folder contains other folders the contents of the foo.sbd directory recursively look like the above list. \nI can honestly say with out any hesitation that I have got this answer from think FAQ-Evolution web-page. you can review that for more information.\n\nA: Evolution uses the Maildir++ specification for local folders, as stated in this commit.\nThe emails end up in a cur folder, each in a separate file, named as such:\nTIMESTAMP.PID_INCREMENT.HOSTNAME:VERSION,FLAGS\n\nThe VERSION is always 2. The FLAGS are the first letters of these words: Passed, Replied, Seen, Trashed, Draft, and Flagged.\nOther mail readers, such as mutt, should be able to use these folders.

It runs in 'kiosk' mode (wont save passwords) unless its launched with sudo.\nIs there some setting for me as a regular user, that will allow these applications to run in 'adult' mode when placed on the left icon bar on the desktop?\nI see FileZilla has irritated other and maybe that's the way it is,  but gedit?\nShouldn't I be able to have a full featured text editor without becoming a root user?\n\nA: Global menu\nThis is the expected behaviour in a default Ubuntu/Unity installation where all application menus are integrated as a globalmenu in the top panel:\n\nIt is possible to disable this feature but I would not recommend you do it at the time now. You will likely get used to this behaviour soon and you will enjoy to have all application's menus always in the same place, and often out of the way of your application's main window.\nWhy not for Root?\nIt is the super user Root who runs applications when you call them with sudo or gksu. Since Root does not run your desktop (in fact Root does not have a desktop at all) the application's menu can not be integrated to the top panel and are shown as usual.\nHowever it is not recommended to run graphical applications as root because you will then have enough power accidentally harm your otherwise very stable OS.\n", "Q: Unable to access internet from devices connected over WiFi hotspot with Ubuntu 13.04 I am using Ubuntu 13.04 and till couple of days ago I was able to connect to internet using the hotspot connection I had created previously when I started using Ubuntu 10.\nBut two days back I noticed that devices are getting connected to WiFi but are not able to access internet.\nI deleted my old WiFi hotspot and created a new one by going to network settings and there by clicking create a hotspot option.

I've been trying several different installation methods to install Ubuntu on my partition. No matter what kind of installation type (CD or USB), I get the same error message.\nAt first I assumed I was using the incorrect Ubuntu version but I'm quite confident I'm on the right path after this question:\nWhich Ubuntu ISO should I burn for my system?\nI am trying to install Ubuntu on a machine that has Windows 8 natively installed according to this answer by Luis Alvarado: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nUEFI is on, secure boot is off and the disc/USB loads properly.\nFrom the CD I simply get the error message when booting, but when booting from USB (created USB according to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows) I get to choose to run Ubuntu without installing, or to install it.\nEither (both) of these options gives me the following error message:\nata_id[334]: HDIO_GET_IDENTITY failed for '/dev/sdd': Invalid argument\n\nUser 'thefourtheye' suggested in my previous question that this error message is due to that the OS is unable to identify by disk drive. That is entirely possible - but how do I solve it?\nSome say that there's something wrong with the drivers for Ubuntu to ID the USB, and that I could write my own drivers for that. It seems a bit over my head though.\nBurning program used was imgburn for the CD, from SetupImgBurn_2.5.7.0.exe. I burnt the image to the disc, it was recognized as a boot disc and when inspecting the CD's content it looked as it should according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: I provide that you made your USB-stick bootable and after plug-in your USB-stick ... - you need to edit Bios-settings (press key 'F2' at beginning of reboot). Disable Uefi-Bios and enable Efi-Bios. Then in Boot-Order of devices your USB-stick should be set at first place of all booting devices (hard-disk at second place). Then save edits and reboot.\nHDIO_GET_IDENTITY refers to your hard-disk which is a new-brand. Though Ubuntu has mostly the newest drivers, your hard-disk is newer. You might be able to get passed this by trying a newer version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: gammu smsd server unresponsive I have an enfora modem connected to a serial port on my server machine (which I access via ssh since it is remote) running ubuntu.

I have a headless machine connected to my sound system, and I am using it to run a music playing daemon that I control over the network. (Among other things)\nHowever, I can't seem to be able to have sound come out of my speakers without running X.\nI am running pulse audio in a system wide instance and my daemon is not running within X. Nevertheless, when my daemon is playing music without me hearing it, I can fix it by running startx in an unrelated session. After X starts, I can hear the sound. The sound disappears again if I kill the X server.\nInterestingly/annoyingly, the sound also stops after X has been running for a few minutes. This could possibly be because of a screen saver of some sort, but I haven't been able to verify or falsify this theory.\nSo my current workaround is to ssh into the box whenever I want music and startx, and restart it every fifteen minutes or so. I'd like to do better.\n\nI have been able to verify the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adjustments in alsamixer have no effect on this problem.

I've been using it for many short stories, and currently for writing a novel, and it hasn't failed me yet. Plus, the developer of this software is always open to suggestions to make the tool better. :) \nThat said, Plume Creator only focuses on only writing, so you aren't bothered by formatting and organizing. It also has an Outliner to plan your plot, as well as Notes for note-taking and Attendance for keeping character / items / settings data. This structure helps you finish your book in no time. \nOf course, after finishing your draft, you'll need to \"format\" the manuscript in LibreOffice or LaTeX. So that said, Plume Creator (like Scrivener) is recommended for writing first drafts, while LibreOffice for the actual formatting, editing and processing. \n\nA: Scrivener is an option.  There is well-polished beta available for free on the Literature and Latte site .\nBecause it is commercially available, links for download (and support) come from the dedicated forum there. \nAs Joe points out, \"A lot of people on the SE Writers forum are very fond of Scrivener. You may want to take a look there at some of the posts about it - and for all things about writing.\"\nSigil, an ebook editor, is available via ppa : http://code.google.com/p/sigil/wiki/LinuxDistroPackages\nYou might also consider a wiki editor. One of the Writing Excuses people recommended wikidpad.

We have two user categories in particular\n  in mind:\nNovelists who produce long texts with complicated plots involving many\n  characters and scenes but with limited formatting. Textbook authors\n  who want to take advantage of the added possibilities in eBooks\n  compared to paper-based textbooks. For the first category Calligra\n  Author will provide tools which are used in different phases of the\n  creative process: Synopsis, writing, reviewing, polishing and\n  publishing.\nFor the second category Calligra Author will provide interactive\n  content elements like multimedia, 2D and 3D animations, embedded web\n  content and support for javascript scripting. It is our ambition to\n  work with other application developers to make Calligra Author\n  integrate well with other writers tools like e.g Plume Creator.\n\nNote that if you install Calligra Author, you will be pulling in a lot of other KDE and Calligra Suite packages.  \n\nA: You can use LibreOffice Writer.

So it's best to use several applications along the way, one for each phase your in:  1>Brainstorming 2>Drafting 3>Editing 4>Publication.   \n\n\n*\n\n*LaTeX scripting using LyX or Kile to professionally format text files\n\n*Scribus to format Graphical Books \n\n*[or] LibreOffice to draft and format in one step\n\n*FocusWriter for Drafting text without formatting distractions\n\n*Tomboy Notes for Brainstorming\n\n*Artha a handy Thesaurus and Dictionary\n\n*[or] Zim Wiki, an alternative to Tomboy Notes for Drafting, Brainstorming and organization\n\n*Calibre for ebook creation\n\n\nThe chief problem is with the organization of potentially hundreds of pages of manuscript during the initial drafting stage.   That can be tackled by creating numerous documents for each project, for example one per chapter.  LIBREOFFICE would handle that approach well.  \nSome writers have issues with creating numerous files for each project because it makes it far more difficult to move text around among the various chapters as they draft the book.  For instance, if they are looking for something specific that they drafted a while back and try to search by keyword, then they may have to resort to search through many chapters individually until they score.  \nWith a single file project, Libre Office is very difficult to draft a book.  You have to scroll what might seem like forever before finally reaching the desired portion.  There isn't an easy to use Table of Contents for the file that organizes one file into units available at a click.  With Libre Office you will inevitable end up scrolling much more of your writing time away compared to other tools that automatically navigate around a file to specific sections, like a table of contents.\nZIM WIKI DESKTOP is an excellent way to draft a book length manuscript, quickly organizing the raw text into sections.  The output can be exported into numerous formats including HTML, and of course WIKI format, its primary design purpose.  \nPrior to the drafting stage, TOMBOY NOTES makes an excellent way of sketching the book and writing preliminary chapters in text format.  The user creates notes, i.e. chapters, ideas, or anything that typed up. The advantage with it is that it excels above other applications in it's ability to search and retrieve keywords from among all its notes, or a selected portion of notes that fall under a user created notebook.  Tomboy Notes can be imported into ZIM WIKI DESKTOP or exported to HTML, or TEXT.\nBoth ZIM WIKI and TOMBOY NOTES are fairly distraction free compared to heavy weight applications like Libre Office. \nFocusWriter is designed specifically to eliminate distractions.  The application can takes up the entire screen and has a foreground (page) and background (frame around the page).  A menu pops up at the top of the screen when moused over.  When mousing over the bottom of the screen the writing goals pop up, such as the percentage of words per day completed.  A timer can be set also.  When mousing over the left edge of the screen a table of scenes list pops up, to easily navigate from among those defined, making navigation around a lengthy document possible. There is also spell check, as is the case with all the other programs I've mentioned in this post.\nAnother handy tool is ARTHA  It's a powerful thesaurus and dictionary that automatically pops up on any word highlighted on any of the programs mentioned.  The user simply presses ctrl-alt-W or the tool gives definitions, alternatives, relatives, and antonyms to the highlighted word.  The user can also redefine the ctrl-key activator to anything that suits their taste.\nAfter the manuscript for the book is drafted, it has to be formatted for printing.  \nPublishers frequently require submittal in RTF or DOC format, then they use this to generate their own proprietary format that they print to paper on.  The specified DOC or RTF formats have to be rigorously adhered to else the publishers will reject them outright.  Still, It's worth reiterating that this is just a preliminary format, not the format the book itself will be printed to paper directly from.\nIf you are self publishing, then ebook formats are a frequent focus.  HTML is the best format to export to because it can easily be converted to popular ebook formats such as epub and mobi, by a third party vendor who offers the service of ebook publication.  Also, the CALLIBRE application can easily convert html formats to epub and mobi since  all three are essentially markup language formats, designed for indefinite viewing dimensions.  (Various ebook reader sizes, or monitors)\nIf you are printing your own books to paper, then LyX (an application that uses LaTeX TeX for formatting) is a method that's popular, at least in the academic world, and for thesis papers.  An alternative to the complex LyX application is to use a much simpler LaTeX editor, like Kile.  You can write a book in plain text, then you can use a customized LaTeX template with /input{chapterFile} statements to \"bring in\" the chapters. You can automatically format a book to see it's progress whenever you like.  What I've done is actually use LyX to develop a LaTeX template, then export the LyX template out for usage with the much simpler Kile Program, and whenever I get anxious to \"see the book\" I switch from my FocusWriter to Kile and press a button to generate my book.pdf file.  It's beautiful!!\nA master of LaTeX can craft a book in simple text, than automatically have LyX or Kile mark it up for Fancy Book output, and do this all with minimal fuss, letting the program handle all the formatting specifics and keeping it out of sight, out of mind to the author. That is a markup approach. You could even get a LaTeX/TeX developer help you develop a template.  Just tell them that the only thing you want to have to do add the proper chapterfile names in the \\input{someChapterFile} commands, and perhaps create a few special markup commands for repeated formatting themes inside your book, like for instance if you have inset poems, letters, clips, or scenebreaks, or special chapter starting text formats.  And then, your chapter text files would be all text, except for a rare markup commands, perhaps something like \\being{aPoem} to start a new formatting environment, followed by \\end{aPoem} to end that special format and restart the default.  LaTeX can be just that easy if you have someone help you setup a template. \nFor graphical books, final formatting and layout can be done with SCRIBUS which offers a true What You See is What You Get approach.  A master of Scribus can craft unique books with lots of graphics, and do this artistically as she sees fit, seeing the exact final output on screen as they edit, and do this more effectively than with a traditional word processor like Libre Office, or a non traditional markup \"document\" processor like LyX.\nAll of those final formatting methods will require a significant learning curve to master, but they can offer special advantages.  \nThe key is taking the time, LOTS of time, to learn those tools.  LibreOffice can also format a final draft of a book for final print to paper.  Its easy to start, but still takes quite some time to discover all its capibilites.  Prepare to also have learning time with this application.  Hopefully you've got a first draft done else the learning phase could be a major distraction from the creative writing process.   Still, the hurdle of success is stepped much lower with Libre Office than with LyX or Scribus.  Prepare time for any of these, though, to vent from software frustrations as you learn.  \nLastly, Calligra Suit with Calligra Author was in fast paced development (not to be confused with Calibre for ebook creation and management). It's an alternative to LibreOffice.  In addition to the word processor, Calligra Words, it offers an additional tool called Calligra Author that focuses on distraction free writing, organizing and easy ebook exporting directly into the ebook formats: epub and mobi.  After a spurt of development, in 2014 the Calligra Author tool seemed to have slowed down, but it's worth keeping track of.  When their project finally reaches fruition it should become an extremely powerful tool. But until then, I'm still waiting.\n--SOFTWARE INSTALLATION NOTE--\nI use the Software Center in Kubuntu to install all the software mentioned except LaTeX.  For that, I want to make sure I get the FULL INSTALLATION of fonts etc.  (the default installation in particularly limited)  So, instead I recommend opening a terminal window to download from the command line.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install texlive-full \n\n\nA: For smaller projects, you should be fine with Libreoffice Writer. \nIf you are looking for a professional typesetting tool, the most well known and most widely used open source program is called LaTeX. On Ubuntu, the texlive LaTeX distribution is available in the software repository.\nBeware, that LaTeX is not a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, but a WYGIWYW (What You Get Is What You Want) typesetting language, and can in some respects be compared to HTML. \nLaTeX files are plain text, which are compiled by the LaTeX program into DVI or PDF files. There exist numerous style templates, and with some knowledge of the LaTeX language one can write them oneself.\nUsing a style template and only writing plain text spares the user the tedious work with layout, and lets the writer concentrate on what is being written instead on how it might look in the end.\n\nA: While LaTeX certainly is a major player here, I really like\nSphinx\nIt's mainly used for writing documentation for open source projects to be published as static HTML. However, it's also possible to write a book with it.\nIt's not WYSIWYG, but works much like LaTeX. The markup it uses is Restructured Text (commonly used) or Markdown if you want. It is a bit easier and has less features. I also think it's a lot more flexible with the use of extensions, custom generators, etc.\nHere's an example book (randomly chosen from Books Produced by Sphinx): Theoretical Physics Reference 0.1 (1st-edition) (options: html, pdf, book, source, blog post)\n\nA: focuswriter\n\n\nFocuswriter is a fullscreen writing program designed to be distraction\n  free.

It can be converted to html, LaTeX, PDF, etc. Here is a short article about how to use org-mode of Emacs for writing short articles: http://www.academia.edu/4005672/Easy_Blogging_With_Emacs\n\nA: I have a friend who makes her living as an author. She tells me that there is only one program for writing a book: namely, \"the program your publisher requires you to use.\" If you're using a publisher, which my friend tells me is the best way to go even though self-publishing is so easy anymore, find out the format in which they want their submissions, and use the program that creates that format.\nThat may involve using Microsoft Word, at least at the very end (to make sure that the formatting from Libreoffice or Abiword or whatever Word-compatible program you used to write your book has formatted and saved your book accurately.)\nIf you're self-publishing, I'd recommend using MarkDown in a text editor, only because it'll give you the most options for publishing formats. MarkDown will save to darned near anything.\n\nA: Books Writing for Linux\nFolks wanting to write a Book using Linux have a good many choices to make.\n1st> Is the book literary, like a novel, or is it more visual, like a textbook, or is it extremely visual, like a picture book?\n2nd> Who is publishing the book and do they accept a final format version or a pre format version.  Createspace and Lulu for instance require a final format version.  A publishing house usually requires a pre format version.\nThe answers to those two questions help to decide which Linux software you'd want to use for your book project.\nScribus: The more visual it is, the more likely you'd want to use a program like Scribus.  With it you tediously layout everything page by page exactly the way you want it printed out.  \nLibreOffice:  This option if for mostly text based books, but can still handle plenty of pictures.  It's the option most Linux folks will use since it handles a broad range of book types and writing styles well.  \nCalligra is an alternative suite that might be catching up with LibreOffice in development.  Keep an eye on it for now.   There is an application within the suite called Author that's under development designed especially for book projects.  It might be another year or two before its robust enough to benefit from.\nThe above programs are great in the sense that you can use them to complete your entire book project, both Content Creations and Format Creation.  Those are the TWO primary steps in creating a book.  If you consciously make an effort to break them down into steps, you might have better productivity, AND better content and format at the very end.\nSo consider using two Linux programs, one designed for each step, for a superior outcome and performance.  \nA> Content Creation:\nLiterary text--\nFOCUSWRITER -- The best Linux choice for Content creation of literary text, for a book, is Focuswriter.  With FocusWriter you create text files, one for each Chapter for instance.  It's a LOT better than a text editor because you can layout the dimensions of a writing box, and a fullscreen wallpaper that goes behind it.  You decide the font to suit your eyes for Content Creation, not the published print.  It features spellcheck, wordcounts, wordcount goals per day, hour goals per day, popout menus from the botttom (text files for each chapter, for instance), popout menus from the left side (this breaks a single text file into sections or scenes for instance) and popout menu from the top (settings, file options, etc).  and popout scrolling from the right.\ngraphics--\nGiMP, InkScape.  For book covers and graphics.\nB> FORMAT for publication.\nOnce you have the text files created (front matter, the main matter or chapters, the back matter) you need to format them for publishing.  To do that, you can use LibreOffice.  A a publishing house is accepting your project, it may require a doc file, so you'd it, or an alternative program like Calligra.  There are other's as well including AbiWord.\nLaTeX, LyX:  But there's another alternative for folks who self-publish or are have a publisher that accepts Fully Formatted pdf files.  This option is especially good for Linux folks who like to script.  is to use LaTeX with LyX.  But, before you do, you need to know who is publishing the book, and the format they require.  A publishing company will typically require a preformatted version rather than the final formatted version, in a doc file.  Again, LibreOffice will be what you need.  Scribus might be a solution for others.  If you decide to self publish on Createspace or Lulu then a pdf option exists and you need a final format version.  In that case, LyX with LaTeX is a good choice, but requires a heavy learning curve that most aren't going to tolerate struggling through.  \nThe benefit of LaTeX, LyX is that, if you have a book series, and it's primarily text based, but can include pictures that are of secondary importance to the look and feel of your book, then you can script templates that will automatically format the text files of you chapters into a book literally a click of the button, with page numbering, hyphenation, justification, headers, tables of contents, all generated nicely to your templates specs.  \nLaTeX is especially well known in the academic world for handling mathematical formula and equations with spectacular results.  So, if your book is a novel, or something academic with a lot of equations and text and bibliography, that's the way to go, if you can script a template, and if your publisher accepts a final format version pdf such as Createspace and Lulu accept.\n\nA: You might want to try troff (or groff which is the GNU version), the standard UNIX text processing tool. Although its main application area is UNIX man pages, it is more than capable of formatting books. \nIn my opinion it is far easier to master than LaTeX (especially if you don't need any fancy formatting) and will produce professional output. \nIt comes pre-installed on any Linux or BSD based OS (to the best of my knowledge anyway). \n\nA: You can also use AbiWord. It has only basic features, but it's a very lightweight application.\n\n\nA: If you use Kubuntu, you can use Calligra Words.\n\n", "Q: How to run a script when user logs in?

It might be helpful for your scenario , you can know more about it by reading its man page.\n", "Q: What happens after `ubuntu-bug` has done its thing? Until some time ago you ran apport-bug or ubuntu-bug to start reporting a bug. The system would then open launchpad with your account, upload the collected information and let you add more info to the bug report.\nNow when I run gksudo ubuntu-bug (for instance with a crash-file as argument) the common bug dialog appears \n \nand thats all.\nWhere is the report being sent to? Definitely not to launchpad as a bug report (although in the concrete situation people have been able to file a report about that bug).\nSo: where is this report sent to (and just maybe) how can I still file a bug report from my system (makes uploading of the pertaining files much easier)\nCould it be that \"the system\" decided that this would be a duplicate of an already existing bug?\n\nA: Technically, ubuntu-bug just logs the crash report locally. A separate program, whoopsie, watches for logged reports and uploads them to a central database, where they're automatically grouped to identify overarching problems.\nThe resulting data is displayed on the Ubuntu error tracker:\n\nAggregate trends are publicly available, and report details are available to trusted developers. More details are available on the Ubuntu Wiki.\nBy default, ubuntu-bug doesn't open bugs on Launchpad for crash reports in stable releases, but you can configure it to if you want. After making that change, you can open a bug for an existing crash report by running ubuntu-bug /var/crash/foo.crash.\n\nA: The collected information or report gets uploaded to a bug tracking system.\n\nIf any process in the system dies due to a signal that is commonly\n  referred to as a 'crash' (segmentation violation, bus error, floating\n  point exception, etc.), or e. g. a packaged Python application raises\n  an uncaught exception, the apport backend is automatically invoked. \nIt produces an initial crash report in a file in /var/crash/ (the file\n  name is composed from the name of the crashed executable and the user\n  id). If the crashed process belongs to the user who is currently\n  logged in, or it belongs to a system process and the user is an\n  administrator, apport informs the user about the crash and offers to\n  report the problem.\nIf the user leaves the \"Send error report\" checkbox enabled, Apport\n  uploads the collected information to the bug tracking system. After\n  that it opens the packages' bug filing page with a sensible default\n  bug title and leaves the rest of bug filing process to the web UI.\n\nUbuntu receives an incredibly large number of bug reports every day through our bug tracking system. Each one of these needs to be read, assessed, and sorted so it can be fixed. This is where we could use your assistance with Helping With Bugs. For a visual representation of the bug triage process, see these nice Flow Charts.\nEvery bug report is a conversation with the reporter. The first contact any reporter usually has with the Ubuntu community is through a bug triager, who tries to put together a complete bug report. It's very important that we give a good impression, so please be polite and try to use your best English.\nWorking on simple, untriaged bugs is a good way to get started and become acquainted with the triaging procedure since you'll have to deal with every aspect of the life cycle of a bug. The section Untriaged bugs explains where to find them. \nBug Types\nApport reports\nApport reports are bugs reported via the automated bug reporting program Apport. Reporting bugs using Apport is the preferred way of reporting a bug since it gives the developers a lot of information about the affected system. When Apport is used, less additional information is required, speeding up the whole process. \nYou can recognize these bugs by the added list of system information in their description. Some programs have hooks for Apport, adding more information when reporting a bug. This information can usually be found in the attachments. \nConfirmed bugs\nWhen a bug is marked as 'Confirmed' it is not fully triaged yet. This bug is very close to being marked as 'Triaged', but you need to make sure it is ready for the developers to fix.\nFeature Requests\nIf the bug report is actually a feature request, there are two possibilities. If the requested enhancement is small and well-defined and/or the suggestion concerns an upstream project, the Importance of the bug should be set to 'Wishlist'. When the report is complete the status should be set to 'Triaged'. \nOnly the members of the Ubuntu Bug Control team can do so. If you're not a member you'll have to ask someone who is to do it for you. Paste the bug number in #ubuntu-bugs and say you think the bug should be set to 'Wishlist'. Someone will notice and set it for you, although not necessarily immediately.\nHow does it work internally?\nCrash interception\nApport uses /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern to directly pipe the core dump into apport: \n$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern\n|/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c\n$ \n\nNote: that even if ulimit is set to disabled core files (by specyfing a core file size of zero using ulimit -c 0), apport will still capture the crash. \nFor intercepting Python crashes it installs a /etc/python*/sitecustomize.py to call apport on unhandled exceptions. \nExample\nApport is even able to capture core files if PID 1 (Upstart) dies: \n\n\n*\n\n*If Upstart detects an internal inconsistency, it raises the SIGABRT\nsignal.\n\n*The Upstart crash handler is called on SIGABRT.\n\n*Upstart crash handler forks a child process.\n\n*The Upstart child process re-raises the signal which results in the child exiting abnormally. \n\n*The kernel detects the child process has exited abnormally and calls apport, piping the core file to apports standard input (due to /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern). \n\n*apport writes the core file to disk in /var/crash/. \n\n*PID 1 waits for its child to terminate (which only happens once apport has finished writing the core file). \n\n*PID 1 exits. \n\n*kernel panics. \n\n*On next boot, Whoopsie will detect the crash file and process it. \n\n\nBackend\nIn order to keep the delay and CPU/IO impact as low as possible, /usr/share/apport/apport only collects data which has to be acquired while the crashed process still exists: information from /proc/pid, the core dump, the executable path, and the signal number. The report is written to /var/crash/executable_path.uid.crash. \nFrontend invocation\nIn Gnome, update-notifier keeps an inotify watch on /var/crash. Whenever there is something new, it calls /usr/share/apport/apport-checkreports. If there are new reports, it calls /usr/share/apport/apport-gtk, which is the frontend shown in the screenshots above. \nThe frontend then collects additional information like package versions, package file checksums, or OS version, and calls all matching package hooks. \nTo disable this, you can run gsettings set com.ubuntu.update-notifier show-apport-crashes false (as your ordinary desktop user). \nLaunchpad-based auto-retracer\nThe Canonical data center runs a service which automatically retrace bugs with apport. By tagging the bugs according to architecture in Launchpad, a retrace will be done and the tag will be removed. Tags that are used are need-i386-retrace or need-amd64-retrace. See the announcement. \nPer-package Apport Hooks\nIt is possible for packages to specify information gathered from the system and included in the bug report. These are done by apport hooks contained in packages. For some useful examples see: \n\n\n*\n\n*source_xorg.py - adds additional log files and hardware details to\nbug reports\n\n*usplash - ignores crashes in specific code paths\n\n*source_totem.py - asks the reporter questions and gathers different\ninformation based on responses\n\n\nin /usr/share/apport/package-hooks. There is also a list of packages providing apport hooks. \nIf a crash or bug report is submitted through apport, the relevant hooks will be run automatically. If you have an already reported bug that was filed without apport, and you are interested in the information from those hooks, you can ask the bug reporter to use apport-collect bugnumber. \nUse the source, Luke!\n\n\n*\n\n*You can download the upstream tarball from the Launchpad project\npage, or the Ubuntu source tarball from the Ubuntu archive.\n\n*apport is developed with the bazaar RCS on Launchpad. If you want to\ncontribute to it or develop your own system based on it, you can get\nyour own branch with bzr get lp:apport for trunk, or debcheckout -a\napport for the Ubuntu packaging branch.\n\n\nFuture plans\nVarious improvements to performance, better tools to work with reports, and integration of more languages (Mono/Python stack traces, assertion messages, etc.) See the relevant specification. \nSources:Apport, How To Triage, and How to enable Apport \n", "Q: After clicking \"Install Ubuntu inside Windows 7\" and rebooting it always asks if I would like to try Ubuntu out or install Ubuntu I have downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 and I cannot get it to install.

I've been googling around looking for a fix but nothing seems to help. Maybe it has something to do with the drivers? I checked additional drivers in the system settings, but it says there are no drivers present. Any ideas?\nAlso, this issue isn't present all the time. But sometimes when I go to shutdown or restart Ubuntu, it will just loops to the login screen.\nThank you, for any input or help! Also I can get some logs of these issues, but not really sure how to go about all of that. I'm not to familiar with ubuntu, as i've only been using the desktop version for a couple months now.\n\nA: For the perpetual shutdown problem, unplug any usb devices when the computer is booting or shutting down. I've been pretty lazy lately so I only know the workarounds and not the voodoo behind them, but it keeps my laptop from hanging up. \nFor your issue resuming from sleep, see if you can drop to a console with ctrl + alt + F2  when it hangs up, and then switch right back to tty7 with ctrl + alt + F7\nSaw this thread on the side of the page and its got some more ideas to try.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Once installed geos library (C++, and C), and then trying to install rgeos package (R), it reports geos-config missing!

I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop and it works great, except after the initial reboot my touchpad cursor shakes violently when I hold my finger completely still on the pad.It works fine with a regular mouse plugged in. I couldn't find much scouting around the internet except that it might be that my touchpad doesn't have any dead zones? I am very new to Ubuntu and am fairly computer savvy, but I don't know a lot about using the terminal or anything like that, so if you could dumb down a fix for this as much as possible for me, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: Try tweaking your touchpad settings with the synclient command from the terminal.\nThe man page for synclient mentions the \"pressure\" value which tweaks capacitance on most modern touchpads.  It sounds particularly interesting in your scenario.\n\nA: I think you must configure synclient.

I Run 12.04 LTS on a HP Pavillion Notebook with 250GB GB HDD. I recently found an emutlaor and noticed something weird. I had a Z: Drive and C: Drive. The C: Drive is the same as it was in windows. My Vista Installation Went belly Up and got a BSOD at loading the OS. Is it possible to access these folders to see if I can recover anything?\n\nA: It is possible that you still have the Windows partition on your drive. To double check, Run sudo fdisk -l to list the partitions. It will give you an output similar to,\n$ sudo fdisk -l\nDisk /dev/sda: 8589 MB, 8589934592 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1044 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00008ec7\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1        1013     8136891   8e  Linux LVM\n/dev/sda2            1014        1044      249007+   5  Extended\n/dev/sda5            1014        1044      248976   83  Linux\n\nNotice the /dev/sdaX part. If you have Windows, it may show up as Extended or VFAT or NTFS depending on the file system.\nTo view the files in the partition, you need to mount it first. In your home directory, create a folder called win and then mount it by typing\n$ mkdir win\n$ mount /dev/sda2 win\n\nIf all goes well, then you will be able to do a cd win and then an ls to list all your files.\n", "Q: Downloading Ubuntu to Computer with No OS I recently got back my computer from a hard drive breakdown.  I got back the computer with everything except an operating system.  I was hoping to be able to download Ubuntu to at least have an operating system, but after burning Ubuntu to a DVD, my computer will not recognize an operating system on the DVD.  What do I need to do differently/add to the DVD to make things work?\n\nA: If you are simply placing the .ISO file onto the disc the computer will not recognize it as bootable and you must therefore use a program like imgburn to \"write image file to disk\" which will then extract the contents to the disc rather than place the ISO on the disc. Then you can resume as usual and boot to the disc.\n\nA: I'd go with what both devs suggested, reburn the iso as a filesystem, simple as using imgburn and set your BIOS settings so your DVD/CD drive is the first that boots up.\n", "Q: Memtest86+ options are missing in Grub menu I had the same problem as @coversnail here: How can I add the Memtest86+ options back to the Grub menu?\nThe problem is: I just can choose between older kernel versions and the actual Ubuntu version in GRUB. There are no other options.\nI want to run memtest86+. It is installed and in /etc/grub.d/, but it is not in GRUB itself. I am kind of confused.\n\nA: Try Grub Customizer.  Grub Customizer is a graphical settings manager for GRUB2.\nTo install,  just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:adabbas/1stppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nOr just check out their website.\nTo add the memtest entries see images below, and the text.\n\n\n\nFirst Entry\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root='hd0,msdos1'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos1 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos1 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos1  b4d22d74-d1db-44c3-a834-e879263662f5\nelse\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root b4d22d74-d1db-44c3-a834-e879263662f5\nfi\nlinux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin\n\nSecond Entry\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root='hd0,msdos1'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos1 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos1 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos1  b4d22d74-d1db-44c3-a834-e879263662f5\nelse\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root b4d22d74-d1db-44c3-a834-e879263662f5\nfi\nlinux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin console=ttyS0,115200n8\n\nNote: Now the above information is correct, but keep in mind that memtest will not work in grub2-uefi . This is because UEFI does not support launching 16-bit binaries and memtest is a 16-bit binary. Thats also the reason why there is no linux16 command/module in grub2 uefi.\nAlso you may want to look at memtest86+ fails on efi systems.\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but it still comes up in searches, so I'm going to give a solution.\nMost distros supply memtest86+. It is not compatible with UEFI, because UEFI does not support 16 bit . However, PassMark Memtest86 (ver. 5 or later) supports UEFI.\nFirst, obtain the memtest files. Download the USB boot image. http://memtest86.com/download.htm Next, extract the files from the image. I burned the image to a flash drive to facilitate installing on multiple computers.\nSecond, install memtest86. I made a 500MB partition at the end of my HDD, and formatted to FAT32. Then copied all files from flash drive to this partition. Note: it is possible to install to your EFI directory, but files need to be renamed to avoid overwriting existing boot files.\nThird, configure grub2-efi menu entry. There are many ways to add an entry, but the safest way that survives update-grub follows. Using root privileges create file /etc/grub.d/39_memtest, and set it executable. (Note: changing the number in the file name changes the position it appears in the grub menu. DO NOT make it lower than 6 to insure that header and theme run first)\nNext make the contents of the file:\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho \"Adding Memtest86\" >&2\n\nexec tail -n +3 $0\n\nmenuentry \"Memtest86\" {\n\nchainloader (hdx,y)/efi/boot/bootx64.efi\n\n}\n\nEOF\n\n*Replace (hdx,y) with your appropriate HDD and partition information.\nThen run update-grub You should now have a menu entry that boots into Memtest86\n", "Q: How come service --staus-all outputs a non-existing service? When I run \nsudo service --status-all\n\nIt outputs\n[ ? ]  jetty\n\nbut there is no such service/process running in the system.\nHow do I cleanup this service/process?\n\nA: \nthere is no such service/process running in the system\n\nThe service name does not have to match the process name as listed by tools like ps or top. Look at the file /etc/init.d/jetty - that's where the service script is located, probably.\nBased on the service name 'jetty', I think this is an instance of Jetty. I would also guess that running\nps aux | grep java\n\nwill give you some Java processes concerning this service.\nJetty is an alternative to Tomcat - a JSP servlet engine. Does that ring a bell?\nTo get rid of this, removing the package should do the trick:\nsudo apt-get remove jetty\n\nThis will work as long as it was installed using the package management. You'll have to remove it manually if you have installed it manually.\n", "Q: Install unetbootin on Ubuntu 12.04 I'm trying to install UNetbootin on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Check if the ISO image your copied over to flash-drive is NOT corrupted. \n[Hint : You could get the MD5 Hash code from the download page of Ubuntu.

Also , can you say your version of Ubuntu please.\n", "Q: Is it Possible to Repair Boot Record on Windows Vista Partition on Dual Boot Ubuntu 12.04.02 LTS Install? I recently successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04.02 Desktop as a \"side-by-side\" on an eMachines ET1641-02w PC; which before had Windows Vista; but was no longer bootable, because the boot sector somehow got trashed. After I installed Ubuntu I can go to Devices/OS and I can access all of my docs, pics, videos, music, etc. on the Windows Vista partition; but I still can't \"boot\" the Windows partition.  I've seen several posts regarding recovering boot sectors using the Boot-repair app; but am wondering if this \"boot-repair\" is only for the Ubuntu partition.  Can I use \"boot-repair\" to repair the Windows Vista boot sector?\n\nA: My personal experience is: no you can't. You need tools from the Windows Vista install disk, not available anywhere due to legal concerns.\n\nA: Insert your Windows Vista disc and find your way to the CMD on included on the disc.\nIn the CMD type:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nAnd if that doesn't work try \nbootrec /fixboot\n\nI must say, I'm unsure whether this will render your Ubuntu unbootable but if you're using GRUB then Windows should have been included in the GRUB boot menu, anyway.\n", "Q: Install Windows alongwith ubuntu 13.04 I have a laptop with ubuntu 13.04 installed in 500gb hard disk. I want to install windows 8 alongside with it(dual boot). I tried installing 13.04 alongside (already existing) windows 8 but failed. so i removed windows 8 and put 13.04 in it. Please help me........ \n\nA: In my experience I installed Windows 8 first, then installed Ubuntu 13.04 (raring) and using GRUB I was able to boot to both operating systems. If the case is that you were able to boot to both previously using an older version of Ubuntu then I suppose you could install a previous version and upgrade via the update manager in the Linux OS. \nIf you wish to access your Windows partition then you could load the Windows 8 disc and use the CMD to recover the boot manager:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nand\nbootrec /fixboot\n\nBut your best bet is to install Ubuntu altering the partitions as you install so that you can set the mount point to / in the hope that GRUB loads there and allows access to both OS's/\n", "Q: How can I export emacs documents in 13.04? When I try to export a document from org-mode in emacs, c-X, c-E now results in 'Can't find library org' whereas in 10.04 it opened the export dialog allowing me to produce html, pdf etc. from the source org file.\nSearching with Google, I found this bug for redhat which looks closely related.\nThe trouble is I don't know how to get hold of the emacs-el package it talks about in ubuntu in order to try its workaround so I'm currently stuck.\n\nA: Depending on which version of emacs you are using, you can either install the emacs23-el or emacs24-el package.\nsudo apt-get install emacs24-el\n\nThat seems to work around the issue here. There is a similar bug on launchpad: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/emacs24/+bug/1172214 , so it seems like it may be a bug in emacs24.\n", "Q: Rebooting problem After restarting my ubuntu PC, I am getting a dialog window showing \"Your system is running in low graphics mode\" and after clicking on 'OK', I was prompted with three options \n  1. Run in low graphics mode for just one session\n  2. Reconfigure graphics\n  3. Troubleshoot the error\n  4. Exit to console login\nWhen I troubleshoot the error, its showing the black screen with following lines which I remember:\nwe do not own /var/log/pm-powersave.log\n   .......................................\n   couldn't write bytes: Broken pipe\n   .......................................\n   .......................................\n   Starting System V runlevel compatibility\ngot strucked at this point.\nActually before restarting, I have changed the owner for all the files under the directory \"/var/log\" and \"/var/lib\". Is there any relation with the above issue. Please help me out to resolve the issue. Its urgent.\n\nA: It could be quite possible depending on what you changed the permissions to, have you considered:\nsudo chmod -R 775 /var/ or sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/*\n", "Q: How can I tell how a panel item was set up I need to do some major surgery on a user account that has somehow sustained configuration damage to the point window decorations are gone, some apps don't listen to the keyboard, etc etc.\nI run xfce4 sessions.  There's a panel on the top of the screen that has applications that I put there once upon a time.  I know how to do that, sort of.  But I don't remember the details of what I specified.  And I'm unaware of an app for the panel that's like the menu editor that lets you see and manipulate an item that's already there.\nI want to do that because I want to re-do this stuff in a different account.  Or possibly do a dotfile transplant on this account and re-edit to include the stuff I'm used to.\n\nA: Right-click the panel, choose Panel preferences. In tab Elements, you'll see the list of items in the panel.\nOn my system, the panels are described in ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-panel.xml, however I found launcher-related information under ~/.config/xfce4/panel/launcher-*.\n", "Q: Is this a viable legitimate way to circumvent NSA spying on me? If I set up my own email server in my basement using Ubuntu along with my own domain, own SMTP server, hosted the emails in my machine, ran a pretty wicked good firewall, would that circumvent spying on my email? \nMore info:\n1 I realize once the email gets replied to outside of my environment that it loses any safeguards I could set up. I'm not concerned about this. I'm more trying to find out if in theory this is possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*For the sake of argument, if it is doable with relative ease, assume I would/will encrypt any protocols if they aren't traditionally encrypted.   This includes DNS too.\n\n*Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that the spying on Americans (and the world) seems to be targeted at all the big players we all fall back on use for all our basic communication needs (Apple, Google, Microsoft, AT&T, Sprint, etc).  Lets assume this \"prism\" program has taken the entire infrastructure of America's fiber optics and has large portions of it (most of which run near the HQ of those formally mentioned companies).  So if I stop using those companies and just run my own email server, is there still a legitimate threat that they could usurp all communication on everyone?  What about the ISPs? And does the data being encrypted matter or do they have a way of cracking that too?\nNo smart remarks. I'm just trying to figure out how the specific of this works.  Since 95% of us use Google, Apple, Microsoft, AT&T in one way or another, naturally setting up your own infrastructure would defeat that, right?\n\nA: Yes, as long as you don't use the Internet for it at all. \nOnce you start relaying packets to a third party, all bets are off. SMTP has no end-to-end security. Say you use HTTPS to craft a message on your own mail server, and your mail server uses SSL/TLS encryption to talk to an SMTP server. You have no control of who is intercepting at that server. You have no influence over whether that server uses encryption to talk to the next server on the way to the recipient. You encrypt only your communication with one endpoint in a long chain, and hope for the best with the rest. \nRunning your own mail server in your basement adds as much security as hand-writing the message by candlelight in a closet before typing it in. It's still going out to the Internet where you have no influence over who encrypts, inspects or stores it. Adding your own e-mail server as one extra link in long untrusted chain does not help at all.\n\nSo why then (if you have been following) do the ISPs seem to not be targeted or even mentioned at all?\n\nBecause you haven't been paying attention. \nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act\nLawful interception\nFCC: Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act and Broadband Access and Services\nThe only way to make it difficult for your e-mail to be intercepted is to encrypt it before it leaves your computer so that it can only be decrypted by the recipient. \n\nA: I assume your ISP will be connected back to them in some way, I mean think about it, it's the largest tactical step in obtaining data from users; go directly to their source. Though I would say that if you are indeed using this private mail service you've set up, it could still be tapped from the cables, the ISP or even the backbones which support the ISP's in the first place so it's not going to be as secure as you'd like it to be.\nSSL methods are indeed quite secure as in an SSL transfer the data is encrypted on the client or server with a key that only the client or server can access. Therefore you could use SSL to communicate with other servers in a safe manner on the web.\nDoes this answer your question at all?\n\nA: If data flows through it, your government knows about it.\nThe more you try to hide, the more you stand out as someone with something to hide, which invites more scrutiny. \nThe only real solution is to unplug, completely and hide in a deep cave in the ground that no one knows about except you. Although I'm sure the powers to be are outfitting insects with surveillance devices to get into every nook and crannies on the planet to find out what or who is there.  \n", "Q: Error while Running SAP for Java I have installed SAP 7.3 on Ubuntu 12.04 and it was working fine. but from last few days its not working.

How to set environment variable without rebooting Ubuntu? Problem: During Android development, in order to add ADB path to environment variable; I did following things:\ngedit /etc/environment - Added my desired path in the file such as :/media/Software/00.AndroidLinux/ADT/sdk/platform-tools\nWhat I noticed is that adding path to the file has no effect to $PATH until I reboot my Ubuntu. \nMy question is: How can I add path to /etc/environment variable, so that I can work with my modified $PATH, and without restarting Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can add to your $PATH variable directly like this:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/the/dir/you/want/to/add\n\nThen, edit /etc/environment.\nAn alternate method would be to still export as I showed above, but then to add the entry to your ~/.bashrc file (if using BASH shell).\necho \"export PATH=$PATH:/the/dir/you/want/to/add\" >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nEDIT: Exporting your $PATH in your ~/.bashrc file rather than /etc/environment keeps you from needing to elevate permissions to edit a \"global\" (system) config file and also keeps other users (if you have any on your system) from having that path auto-added on account creation.\n\nA: Strictly speaking you can't since that file is only read on login, by pam_env. You can however source it in your current shell to read in the values.\n$ . /etc/environment\n\n", "Q: Upload file from my virtual machine to another virtual machine using hadoop hdfs Can any one please tell me, how can I upload a txt file from my local machine to another virtual machine based on IP Address in hdfs.\nRegards,\nLokesh G\n\nA: Simply copy file to hadoop machine using \nscp copy-file.txt user_name@hadoop-machine:/path\n\nReplace the keywords with actual values \nAfter copying file u can simply upload files on HDFS using \nhadoop fs -put copy-file.txt /hdfs-path\n\n", "Q: How can I change icon size in Empathy in 13.04?

The huge icons are very pesky for me because I have a lot of contacts.\n\nA: It cant be changed without modifying the source code, or writing some sort of extension of your own. I find this just as frustrating, makes it more difficult to use at work. \n", "Q: Is removing memtest entries from GRUB a bad idea? The memtest entries in GRUB are just annoying and useless IMO (I think they shouldn't even come preinstalled, they only confuse newbies and if you really need them you can install them later...). Is it a bad idea to remove them?\n\nA: There is no harm in removing them.  I would suggesting leaving them there. Memtest is for checking your RAM. It is very easy to use. You just set it running and watch the results. Basically, a healthy RAM should show no errors.  \nTo remove, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86+\nsudo update-grub\n\nOr just use Grub Customizer.\nYou can always run memtest by downloading the boot CD from memtest.\n\nA: No. Memtest can always be run from optical or USB media instead.\n", "Q: Grub is unable to detect Windows I installed Ubuntu and windows 7 in UEFI mode, but Grub is unable to detect windows.\nI ran boot repair, and here are the contents of the boot info file \n\nA: I noticed several peculiarities in your Boot Info Script output:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Boot Info Script output indicates that the Windows boot loader is installed in the MBR of the disk; but this is normally only the case for BIOS-mode installs of Windows, which also necessarily use MBR rather than GPT. Your disk, though, uses GPT.\n\n*The disk seems to have an ESP (/dev/sda2), but that ESP contains no EFI-mode Windows boot loader -- or at least, the Boot Info Script hasn't identified one.\n\n*Your Windows C: partition seems to be /dev/sda1, whereas your ESP is /dev/sda2. This is legal, but unusual. It indicates manual partitioning of some sort rather than a stock installation as done by the Windows installer or by an OEM setup.\n\n\nBased on this evidence, my hypothesis is that you took a BIOS-mode Windows installation, converted the disk to GPT, and installed Linux. If I'm right, then this explains all the peculiarities I've identified, and it also explains why Windows won't boot: It's configured for BIOS-mode booting, which is now impossible, and it lacks an EFI-mode boot loader. The good news is that you can fix these problems. The bad news is that it will be a bit of a pain to do so.\nYou can consult this page for instructions on converting Windows to boot in EFI mode. Note, however, that those instructions include a lot of steps related to installing the DUET package, which you don't need if your firmware is based on EFI. (DUET is a software-loaded EFI for BIOS-based computers.) Basically, you need to pay attention to steps 3.5 through 3.7 on that page.\nAlternatively, you can wipe the disk clean and re-install both Windows and Linux. This is likely to be the easier way to proceed, but you'll lose any OS customizations you may have created.\n", "Q: Shell Script to block Ip addresses Is it possible to write a shell script that checks connections in an apache server and blocks suspicious ip addresses with large number of connections automatically and fires a mail for it to the system administrator. Please Help.\nI have also heard about fail2ban. Will it be convenient to use fail2ban or a shell script as shell script need to be run on regular time intervals. any comments?  \n\nA: As I was reading the first paragraph, I was thinking about fail2ban.\nThe biggest issue here is detecting a bad user. If you do that manually, skip fail2ban and use sudo ufw deny from 1.2.3.4. That will be a permanent block but there you go.\nfail2ban works best when your system (any service, including a dynamic website) sends things to the logs (syslog or service specific). fail2ban then has a stack of things to look for and then what to do if it finds things.\nFor example, I'm currently employing a fail2ban plugin for Wordpress that sends events to syslog. fail2ban detects three incorrect tries and then blocks the IP for five minutes. It's genius stuff that has pretty much entirely blocked brute force attacks. I mention that plugin as it's a good example of a simple custom-written ruleset. It's easy to see how it works and adapt it for your own needs.\nEmail notification is pretty simple but you can go further and email nmap scans back. Thinking about it, it might be worth running the IP through a whois, extracting the abuse email and automatically sending an abuse report when you ban a user (explaining why).\n\nA: fail2ban will do exactly what you have described.\nIt checks for connections wich try to connect too often. You can do some configurations with fail2ban to check different situations an ban an IP-adress for a specific time or forever. And of course it can send you a mail report.\nI'm using it with logcheck wich gives me a better readable output of the fail2ban messages.\n\nA: You can also use AIPA (https://aipa.elineo.eu) to block IP listed on blacklists as abuseipdb.com, blocklist.de or myip.ms\n", "Q: htop showing duplicate applications with very odd bizarre results upwards of 20,30,40 or more, see screen grab I have attached screen shots of htop and it's bizarre results. Can anyone explain what is happening here? It shows this new copy.com app taking up like 500% of my memory if you count it up.\n\n\n\nA: What you're seeing is perfectly normal.  If you'd like to have an easier view on the eyes (that still shows correct information) you can perform the following steps in HTOP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press F2 to enter the Setup menu.\n\n*With \"Setup\" selected on the left, press the down arrow until you have \"Display Options\" hilighted.\n\n*Press the right arrow (->) to move the cursor to the next column and press the \"space\" key to select \"Tree View\".\n\n*Press the down arrow and select \"Hide kernel threads\" by pressing the \"space\" key.\n\n*Press the down arrow again and select \"Hide userland threads\" with the \"space\" key.\n\n*Press F10 to save your changes.\n\n\nWhat you are seeing by default is a representation of all of the kernel and userland threads being reported.  By following the above steps, you'll not show these threads and have a cleaner view of the running processes on your system.\nIf you'd like, here is what I have in my ~/.config/htop/htoprc file:\n# Beware!

Please correct me if im wrong. \nAny help is appreciated. \nThanks.\n\nA: Nautilus-terminal is not compatible with the version of Nautilus installed by default in Ubuntu 13.04.\nFrom the link you provided:\n\nCompatibility with Nautilus:\nNautilus Terminal 1.0 works with Nautilus 3.0 and 3.2\n  Nautilus Terminal 0.7.1 and previous work only with Nautilus 2.2x and Nautilus 2.3x\n\nThe version of Nautilus available by default in Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring) is 3.6.3 (link)\nYou'll need to downgrade Nautilus (which could very well be a highly involved task due to dependencies) or use a separate terminal window.  For your purposes, tilda or guake may be a decent stand-in until Nautilus-terminal is updated to support Nautilus-3.6.x.\nNOTE: I'd link to tilda and guake, but I don't have at least 10 reputation yet.\nI hope that helps you out.\nEDIT: Updated to add links for tilda and guake since reputation gain.\n\nA: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/nautilus-terminal-10-released-with.html\nTry the method on this link.

How can I make a list with most used commands in terminal?\nI know that this question may be unuseful for any future proposals for some of us, but even like this, the list can be useful when we don't remember a command used once or some times in the past, when we can search at the end of this list.\n\nA: Below command will also list the top 10 most frequently used terminal commands,\nhistory | awk '{a[$2]++}END{for(i in a){print a[i] \" \" i}}' | sort -rn | head\n\nCommand to list all the commands which are most oftenly used in terminal,\nhistory | awk '{a[$2]++}END{for(i in a){print a[i] \" \" i}}' | sort -rn\n\n\nA: We will use the records from .bash_history file to do this. The next command will give you a list of all commands in order that you used them most often:\nhistory | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[ \\t]+|\\\\|\"} {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\n\nIf you want only top 10, you must to add head at the command above:\nhistory | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[ \\t]+|\\\\|\"} {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head\n\nTo get a specific top, for example top 5, use head with -n 5 option:\n\nIf you want the list in reverse order (top with the rarely used commands), don't use r oprion for second sort:\nhistory | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[ \\t]+|\\\\|\"} {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n\n\nAnd finally to get a list with the commands used once for example, use grep ' 1 ' (change 1 with the desired number):\nhistory | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[ \\t]+|\\\\|\"} {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | grep ' 1 '\n\nTo deal with sudo commands (like sudo vim foo), instead of just {print $3} in the awk command, use:\n{if($3 ~ /sudo/) print $4; else print $3}\n\nSo the entire command would look like:\nhistory | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[ \\t]+|\\\\|\"} {if($3 ~ /sudo/) print $4; else print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\n\nFor example:\n$ history | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[ \\t]+|\\\\|\"} {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head\n    284 vim\n    260 git\n    187 find\n    174 man\n    168 echo\n    149 rm\n    134 awk\n    115 pac\n    110 sudo\n    102 l\n\n$ history | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[ \\t]+|\\\\|\"} {if($3 ~ /sudo/) print $4; else print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head\n    298 vim\n    260 git\n    189 find\n    174 man\n    168 echo\n    153 rm\n    134 awk\n    115 pac\n    102 l\n     95 cd\n\nYou can see the jump in counts for vim, rm, etc.\n\nA: Fish & Bash - The question doesn't specify a specific shell, just 'terminal'.\nChange head to whatever number you want.\nFish \nhistory | awk '{print $1}' | sort  | uniq --count | sort --numeric-sort --reverse | head -10\n517 git\n314 drush\n197 sudo\n171 cd\n115 man\n103 echo\n 95 vi\n 81 dig\n 67 set\n 66 ls\n\nThis Bash one seems to work and is a bit shorter and easier to understand than the other answers.

I am going to build a trading system with java and mysql but I am not sure should I use desktop or server version. The backtest part would involve a lot of calculation and live trade part requests stability and quick response timing.\n\nA: So you are setting up a trading system using that machine as a server? And then people can connect using a website or something like that? Well, then I would definitely choose Ubuntu Server.\n\nA: If this is to be a dedicated server, then I would definitely recommend using a long-term supported release of Ubuntu Server. On the other hand, if you plan to run your services alongside personal applications (e.g. on your desktop or laptop), I would recommend using a long-term supported release of Ubuntu Desktop. Installing a command line system from an Alternate image is also a good choice if you want more control over how much resources your system consumes on its own graphics and - in a production context - other bloatware.\nEither way, before you try to run any GNU/Linux-based service in a production environment, make sure you know how to use the terminal properly and how to keep your system up to date.\n", "Q: How to make the command line history apply across all terminals I always have at least 3 terminator (a terminal program) windows open, but sometimes open another terminal to just do something quickly. How can I make it so the command history is common throughout all of them?\n\nA: Thanks to the link provided by gertvdijk above I am posting my favorite solution from it.\nHere is my attempt at Bash session history sharing. This will enable history sharing between bash sessions in a way that the history counter does not get mixed up and history expansion like !number will work with some constraints.\nUsing Bash version 4.1.5 under Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx).\nHISTSIZE=9000\nHISTFILESIZE=$HISTSIZE\nHISTCONTROL=ignorespace:ignoredups\n\nhistory() {\n  _bash_history_sync\n  builtin history \"$@\"\n}\n\n_bash_history_sync() {\n  builtin history -a         #1\n  HISTFILESIZE=$HISTSIZE     #2\n  builtin history -c         #3\n  builtin history -r         #4\n}\n\nPROMPT_COMMAND=_bash_history_sync\n\nExplanation:\nThe function history() overrides the builtin history to make sure that the history is synchronised before it is displayed. This is necessary for the history expansion by number (more about this later).\nAppend the just entered line to the $HISTFILE (default is .bash_history). This will cause $HISTFILE to grow by one line.\nSetting the special variable $HISTFILESIZE to some value will cause Bash to truncate $HISTFILE to be no longer than $HISTFILESIZE lines by removing the oldest entries.\nClear the history of the running session. This will reduce the history counter by the amount of $HISTSIZE.\nRead the contents of $HISTFILE and insert them in to the current running session history. this will raise the history counter by the amount of lines in $HISTFILE. Note that the line count of $HISTFILE is not necessarily $HISTFILESIZE.\nMore explanation:\nStep 1 ensures that the command from the current running session gets written to the global history file.\nStep 4 ensures that the commands from the other sessions gets read in to the current session history.\nBecause step 4 will raise the history counter, we need to reduce the counter in some way. This is done in step 3.\nIn step 3 the history counter is reduced by $HISTSIZE. In step 4 the history counter is raised by the number of lines in $HISTFILE. In step 2 we make sure that the line count of $HISTFILE is exactly $HISTSIZE (this means that $HISTFILESIZE must be the same as $HISTSIZE).\nAbout the constraints of the history expansion:\nGenerally, once you have more than one Bash session, there is no guarantee whatsoever that a history expansion by number will retain its value between two Bash prompt displays. Everytime PROMPT_COMMAND is executed some command from another Bash session may snuck in your current session history and then the history numbers will be different. That means you always have to look up the number immediately before using it. I find this constraint reasonable. I have to look the number up every time anyway because I can't remember arbitrary history numbers.\nUsually I use the history expansion by number like this\n$ history | grep something #note number\n$ !number\n\nI recommend using the following Bash options.\n## reedit a history substitution line if it failed\nshopt -s histreedit\n## edit a recalled history line before executing\nshopt -s histverify\n\nStrange bugs:\nRunning the history command piped to anything will result that command to be listed in the history twice. For example:\n$ history | head\n$ history | tail\n$ history | grep foo\n$ history | true\n$ history | false\n\nAll will be listed in the history twice. I have no idea why.\nIdeas for improvements:\nModify the function _bash_history_sync() so it does not execute every time. For example it should not execute after a CTRL+C on the prompt. I often use CTRL+C to discard a long command line when I decide that I do not want to execute that line. Sometimes I have to use CTRL+C to stop a Bash completion script.\nCommands from the current session should always be the most recent in the history of the current session. This will also have the side effect that a given history number keeps its value for history entries from this session.\n", "Q: Visually recognise active window Ubuntu 13.04\nI work with two monitors, usually with lots of different windows open.\nI don't like to use the mouse, so swap between applications using alt-tab usually.\nThe problem comes when I want to type something into an application. I need the active application to immediately obvious, usually so that I can tell which monitor to look at next.\nWith default ubuntu (with appearance = ambiance), the only real visual indication of a window being active is that the header bar of the application is in a lighter font color.\nThis is too subtle for me, so I find myself alt-tabbing and moving my mouse too much when switching applications, then clicking around with the mouse to give a particular window the focus.\nI want my switching to be more accurate, and for that I think I need better feedback on what window has the focus. This needs to be more obvious than it is now.\nI looked at the high contrast appearance, and it helps somewhat, but the inconsistency in the icon sets is far too distracting.\nI think what I need is a something like a bright border right around the window, or something like that, to make the active window really stand out. Or, maybe to have the non-active windows fade to the background a bit.\nI would appreciate tips on how others overcome this problem, to make the active window stand out visually from the other windows.\nThank you!\n\nA: Inactive windows can be dimmed using the pluggin 'add helper' in compiz config setting manager'. You may need to install ccsm from software center.  \nIf you are using many windows at a time, use workspace.

I just returned to ubuntu (13.04) after a year using OS X exclusively. I love the improvements that have come to ubuntu and unity, and I'm glad to be back. There's just one thing, though...\nSlate is a simple OS X tool that allows users to quickly create powerful keyboard macros and really take advantage of their screen space. I have to say I was spoiled by it. Even on a tiny laptop, my workflow was never interrupted by changing workspaces or leaving the keyboard to adjust a window, because perfect adjustment was a keystroke or two away. For example:\nbind h:ctrl;alt;cmd resize -10% +0\n# this increases the window's left width by 10%\nbind h:shift;alt nudge -10% +0\n# this moves the window left by 10%\n\nYou make a big config file, and like vim, tmux, and everything else, it just becomes muscle memory.\nI can't seem to find a way to achieve anything close to this in linux or ubuntu. I've tried to make do with compiz window settings and the built-in stuff Ubuntu offers, but it's not even in the same realm. Although to be fair, this level of tuning isn't something most people care about.\nThanks, guys. :) Any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nA: The best I've managed in Unity to bind the Compiz \"grid\" functions to Win+Left and Win+Right, and re-enable multiple workspaces. Unity lets you swap workspaces with Ctrl+Alt+[direction], and pull a window between workspaces with Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[direction]. The four default workspaces in unity are arranged in a \"four corners\" style, which I find makes them quite easy to keep track of. It works really, really well on a single monitor.\nUnfortunately, Unity provides no good way to move a window between two monitors, and, as you pointed out, it's lacking in more granular window management options.\nSo, if you really want good window management, and you're alright with ditching Unity, I can't recommend xmonad strongly enough. It doesn't have Unity's UI polish, and customization can be tricky (you do all the scripting in Haskell), but once you're up and running, it's the absolute best keyboard-focused window manager I have ever used. Ever.\nIt has the resizing feature you mentioned built in. It also automatically resizes your windows as you open new ones, and puts one workspace on each monitor (rather than having a workspace \"shared\" between two monitors as in Unity or OSX). \n", "Q: Internet connection drops out I have this random network failure.

I have a 64 bit UBUNTU 13.04 \nrunning gcc --version shows me gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-1ubuntu1) 4.7.3\nBut on May 31 2013 gcc 4.8.1 was released . And I don't know how to install it ..\nCan someone please explain me the steps that I need to do for successfull installation .. \nAlso please tell me whether I can have both the instances of gcc installed i.e 4.7.3 & 4.8. 1 or not ??\nAnd after installation how can I point to the new gcc 4.8.1 ??\n\nA: If you want to keep your old gcc, as I do, then do this instead:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8\n\nThen to compile with older gcc, mine was 4.7:\ngcc main.c\n\nTo compile with gcc 4.8:\ngcc-4.8 main.c\n\nYou might find typing the extra -4.8 annoying, in which case follow the other answers given by raven and Amir. I quite like this method, as it gives me the choice to use a fall-back version (4.7) if I encounter a bug!\n\nA: Use the mirrors listed Here and download the 4.8.1. The process is pretty straightforward. I would recommend to use this Procedure to complete your installation.\nAs you may know GCC doesn't support \"make uninstall\" and it has been suggested that you install GCC into a directory of its own and simply remove that directory when you do not need that specific version of GCC any longer. Hope this helped. Cheers\nEdited: The Option 2:\nI assume that you already have a former version of gcc, the easiest way could be adding PPA to your repositories and Update and upgrade you can have the latest version with no worries:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthis will add the new PPA to the other sources.\nThen unistall the alternative:\nsudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc \nsudo update-alternatives --remove-all g++\n\nthen:\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.8\nsudo apt-get install g++-4.8\n\nand as the alternative packages install :\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 20\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 20\nsudo update-alternatives --config gcc\nsudo update-alternatives --config g++\n\nat the end:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade -y\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nHope this changes the --version ;)\n\nA: do this exactly\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y\nsudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc \nsudo update-alternatives --remove-all g++ \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install g++-4.8 -y\nsudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y\n\n\nA: The easiest and most simplest way is to add the repository\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test \nand use update manager, this software simplifies whole process of updating packages!\n", "Q: How do I run .bat files in ubuntu?

Pretty much everything works great, except that when I close the lid and it suspends, the machine starts overheating. If I have the machine in my laptop bag, the fans will begin running as fast as possible, the machine will overheat very quickly and drain the battery.\nWhat's more, the machine also hangs when I open the lid again to resume. \nWhat's the deal here?  I've had trouble finding other folks with the same problem. \n\nA: I had these same problems with my MBP 9,1, but only with the nouveau graphics drivers and my discrete GPU.  \nI use GNOME, which has a setting for \"Laptop lid, when closed, will suspend even if there is an external monitor plugged in\" - turning this on let my machine sleep just fine.

Pretty new to Ubuntu and Linux for home use as a whole, anything I've done in the past has been simple server work so I've never had to deal with troubleshooting my own hardware before, anyway.\nI currently have a SteelSeries \"World of Warcraft Cataclysm MMO Gaming Mouse\", which I bought several years ago. When using this with Windows and the SteelSeries downloaded mouse package I was able to use the mouse with no problems whatsoever, however on booting into ubuntu for the first time today, I am completely unable to use the mouse for anything, the courser does not respond to any interaction whatsoever.\nI've seen posts on the ubuntu forums about the same mouse, but these people appear to be struggling to use the additional buttons on the mouse rather than use the mouse for typical activity. I'm not too bothered about using the additional buttons having given up MMO gaming years ago, but these people seem to be able to use the mouse for normal mouse-y things like pointing and clicking whilst I'm struggling to get that far. That's all I want to achieve. \nI had no issues with using the mouse when trying out a debian live CD earlier today, though I subsequently switched straight to a fresh install of ubuntu on booting for the first time into my debian install and finding the mouse wasn't working, thinking that this was probably a nonfree drivers issue that ubuntu would be far more able to cope with.\nIs there anything I can do or anywhere I can look to perhaps figure out what I need to do to get this thing working?

I take a lot of time trying to connect to a Ubuntu Server, but when I finally did that I got this message:\n\n=> There is 1 zombie process.\n\nI reboot it immediately but now I don't know how to find a log or something about the zombie process.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Zombie Process on Wikipedia:\n\nOn Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a zombie process or\n  defunct process is a process that has completed execution but still\n  has an entry in the process table. This entry is still needed to allow\n  the parent process to read its child's exit status. The term zombie\n  process derives from the common definition of zombie — an undead\n  person. In the term's metaphor, the child process has \"died\" but has\n  not yet been \"reaped\". Also, unlike normal processes, the kill command\n  has no effect on a zombie process.\n\n...\n\nZombies can be identified in the output from the Unix ps command by\n  the presence of a \"Z\" in the \"STAT\" column. Zombies that exist for\n  more than a short period of time typically indicate a bug in the\n  parent program, or just an uncommon decision to reap children.\n  If the parent program is no longer running, zombie processes\n  typically indicate a bug in the operating system. As with other leaks,\n  the presence of a few zombies is not worrisome in itself, but may\n  indicate a problem that would grow serious under heavier loads. Since\n  there is no memory allocated to zombie processes except for the\n  process table entry itself, the primary concern with many zombies is\n  not running out of memory, but rather running out of process ID\n  numbers.\n\nDon't wory, it happens sometimes. There's no need to log this kind of event.\n", "Q: Canon Pixma 5350 prints pages splitted (first 3/4 page empty) Ubuntu 12.04 Firstly; I am new to Linux and Ubuntu, so please bear with me. Now onto the question!\nI am using an Canon Pixma 5350 printer on Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu found the drivers and printed the test pages fine.\nWhen I tried to print a (one page) pdf, the page got split in two. on the top of the first printed page is about 6 or 7 cm (which also is the top of the pdf). There isn't really anything wrong with this part, except that the printer spits out the a4 paper and finishes the pdf (everything except the top 6-7 cm) on another paper. When it does this, it starts at the top of the paper again.\nSo what i have printed, from a singe a4 paper pdf is:\n\n\n*\n\n*6-7 cm of the top of the pdf on a page\n\n*everything except the first 6-7 cm of the pdf on another page (starting at the top again)\n\n\nI hope anyone can help me with this problem, I am trying to make the switch from Windows 7 to Ubuntu and a whole new (slightly more difficult) world is opening for me!\nThanks in advance!\nMichael\n\nA: I solved this by downloading Canon drivers from their own website.

Yes it is possible, providing that the images are on a partition accessible by both operating systems, and not used at the same time.\n\nA: The problem isn't so much that the two programs won't get along, it's that you may run into file storage issues.  Windows of course cannot read Linux file systems, and Shotwell has some known issues working with Windows file systems.\nSo while the setup may work, it's not recommended.\n\nA: Another problem: both Picasa and Shotwell work with non-destructive edits that (as far as I know) are not compatible. So if you make edits on a picture (let's say in XP-Picasa) you won't see them when you open the picture in Linux-Shotwell. Unless, of course, you repeat the same edits exactly in Shotwell... (however you manage to do that!)\nYou can also decide to fix your edits by saving different picture versions, but then you lose a big advantage of both these programs: non-destructive edits applied \"on the fly\".\nOnce there was someone trying to import picasa.ini's files (where non-destructive edits are accumulated) into Shotwell database to make the transition much easier, but it did not get far...\nMore recently, another someone decoded picasa.ini's structure and published the results.

The problem that I'm having is that I don't know how to import the module into my QML script. This is for a UT application BTW.\n\nA: This page from the Qt tutorials gives a good description of how to write a QML plugin in C++.  I won't repeat all the details, but the basic idea is that you need to make a new class, inheriting from QQmlExtensionPlugin, to represent the plugin.  It must have a registerTypes method, in which qmlRegisterType is called on each class to be exposed to QML.  Additionally, a qmldir file must be added to the directory containing the .so files.  (Or it can be put in another directory, but include the location of the .so files in the plugin line.)\nI just got done learning this myself, and I've written up what I've learned, if that's any help.\n", "Q: Why does cp not copy files? \n$ ls -la /tee/mysql\ntotal 28675\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      448 Jun 25 13:52 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     2896 Jun 25 12:12 ..\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18874368 Jun 25 13:19 ibdata1\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  5242880 Jun 25 13:52 ib_logfile0\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  5242880 Jun 25 13:19 ib_logfile1\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      984 Jun 25 11:23 mysql\n$ sudo ls -la /var/lib/mysql.old\ntotal 88887336\ndrwx------  6 mysql mysql        4096 Jun 25 11:23 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 41 root  root         4096 Jun 25 13:15 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 mysql mysql           0 Apr 26 11:10 debian-5.5.flag\n-rw-rw----  1 mysql mysql 91010105344 Jun 25 12:12 ibdata1\n-rw-rw----  1 mysql mysql     5242880 Jun 25 12:12 ib_logfile0\n-rw-rw----  1 mysql mysql     5242880 Jun 25 11:23 ib_logfile1\ndrwx------  2 mysql mysql        4096 Jun 20 17:22 m\ndrwx------  2 mysql mysql        4096 Apr 26 11:10 mysql\n-rw-rw----  1 mysql mysql           6 Apr 25 06:40 mysql_upgrade_info\ndrwx------  2 mysql mysql        4096 Apr 26 11:10 performance_schema\ndrwx------  2 mysql mysql        4096 Feb 12 16:22 test\n$ sudo cp -p -f -r /var/lib/mysql.old /tee/mysql\n$ sudo ls -la /tee/mysql\ntotal 28676\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      552 Jun 25 14:09 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     2896 Jun 25 12:12 ..\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18874368 Jun 25 13:19 ibdata1\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  5242880 Jun 25 13:52 ib_logfile0\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  5242880 Jun 25 13:19 ib_logfile1\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        0 Jun 25 11:23 mysql\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      984 Jun 25 11:23 mysql.old\n$ df |grep tee # blocks used available percent-used mounted\n/dev/sda1                       2930232316 186242116 2743990200   7% /tee\n$ cd\n$ touch test\n$ ls test*\ntest\n$ cp -n test test2 # test whether cp works at all\n$ ls test*\ntest  test2\n\nWhy doesn't sudo cp -p -f -r /var/lib/mysql.old /tee/mysql copy the entire contents of mysql.old into mysql?\n\nA: Actually, you copied the mysql.old directory into /tee/mysql:\n\nBut I think that this is not what you wished.

This machine is pre-installed with Windows 8, which I want to keep (the machine is partly a game console).\nI shrank the pre-installed Windows partition by 256GB to make space for Linux and booted from the Ubuntu install DVD.  Initially there was a black screen issue, but adding 'nomodeset' to the kernel options fixed that.  The install disc then booted into its normal Ubuntu environment.  I selected \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8\" and everything proceeded happily until it was time to pull the disc out and reboot.\nAt this point, both the F2 (full BIOS) and F12 (boot menu) startup menus display both \"Windows 8\" and \"Ubuntu\" as UEFI boot options, in addition to IPv4 and IPv6 network boot options.  Windows 8 appears first, then Ubuntu, then network boot.  So much is reasonable; the issue is that selecting Ubuntu boots the system into Windows.\nWindows itself still boots fine.  Disk Management reveals newly created 248.27GB and 7.73GB partitions in the formerly empty space, which I suppose to have been created by the Ubuntu installer; that seems fine.  Following slangasek's comment here, I have not disabled Secure Boot or attempted to place the system in Legacy BIOS mode, since Secure Boot through UEFI is apparently supposed to work.  But if there's a way to boot the Ubuntu install I just made, I can't find it.\nAny advice?\n\nA: The first thing you should try is disabling Secure Boot -- but do not place the system in CSM/BIOS/legacy mode. The comments about Secure Boot that you reference are overly optimistic. In particular, although it does seem to work as planned for some systems, on others it most emphatically does not work as intended. If yours isn't working as intended, the symptoms would likely be precisely the ones you see. Thus, you should first try disabling Secure Boot. If it boots at that point, you can either leave Secure Boot disabled or try to fix it yourself. See my Web page on Secure Boot for more on this topic.\nIf disabling Secure Boot doesn't help, then I recommend you leave it disabled and try my rEFInd boot manager. You can try it without changing your disk configuration by using the USB flash drive or CD-R image; or you can install it from Windows. (If you do the latter, be sure that you install the driver for whatever filesystem you use on your Linux root (/) or /boot partition, though.) In a typical configuration that does not have a separate /boot partition, a rEFInd CD-R or USB flash drive should be able to boot either Linux or Windows directly and without further configuration. If you try rEFInd from an external disk and want to use it permanently, you can install it from either Windows or Linux.\n", "Q: Change background color of selected text I use Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity and when I select a text (for example to copy something from browser), it has ugly orange background.

Funny, huh? So I did a little bit of research to find out how to easily run Tor on Ubuntu. For anyone unfamiliar with Tor, it's an application that anonymizes your traffic by encrypting it and sending over several computers, or \"relay nodes\". It works rather well for anonymous surfing, IM or basically anything else, but not torrents. Do not try to torrent with Tor, it will very likely fail. If all this is fine, and you're interested, read my own answer below :)\n\nA: Okay, so, for this installation process we'll be using the Tor browser bundle. It's a neat package that contains anything necessary to use Tor as you'd normally use it, but it also contains a modified version of Mozilla Firefox that's called the TorBrowser. You don't have to use all of the software included. This guide will cover both using the TorBrowser and simply configuring Tor for routing any other kind of (techspeak: TCP-only) traffic through Tor.\nFirst things first, we gotta download the thing. Find out if your Ubuntu install is 32 or 64-bit. If you don't know how to do this, here's a simple way. Hit Ctrl-Alt-T. A terminal window will pop up. Type in uname -m and hit Enter. If this outputs x86_64 then you're on a 64-bit system. Otherwise, you're on a 32-bit one. Now go over here and download the browser bundle for your architecture. Once the download is finished, head over to whereever the download is stored, right click the downloaded archive and choose Extract here, as shown below. \nOnce the unpacking has finished, you will get a directory called tor-browser_en-US if you downloaded the English version, or tor-browser_ru_RU if you downloaded the Russian one, and so on. Head over to this directory. Now, it's time to decide what to do. If you are an unexperienced user and simply want to browse anonymously, just double-click start-tor-browser. You may be asked what to do with this file, choose Run. A Vidalia window will pop up. Once it says Connected to the Tor network!, wait for a couple seconds and TorBrowser will also open.  Browse as much as you'd like, after done just exit Vidalia and TorBrowser. \nAll that is fine for browsing, but Tor is also capable of encrypting other kind of traffic. Since showing the browser window every time isn't a necessity, and since the configuration used in Tor Browser Bundle is optimal for web browsing but not much else, and it's best to leave it alone since it's a good configuration for using the TorBrowser, the bundle also includes stand-alone versions of Tor and Vidalia. To use Tor standalone, without the browser, just head over to the App folder and double-click the vidalia file. This will open up a \"clean\" Tor session with the default configurations for everything, as if you installed from the package manager (although it tends to work better). However, there is a problem -- it doesn't autodetect the GeoIP database, which is necessary for certain Tor options to work properly. This is an easy fix, actually. Click Settings, go to the Advanced tab and click Edit current torrc. The file is empty by default, which is just fine, since default options are set automatically. You'll need to add a line saying GeoIPFile /path/to/tor-browser_en-US/Data/Tor/geoip where /path/to/ is whatever directory you downloaded the bundle to. Click OK twice and you're all set. If you're familiar with Tor, you may also set any kind of advanced options, but this should be fine for most things. However, you will need to route apps through Tor. The easiest way to do so is to simply modify your system's proxy settings. Go to System Settings and choose Network, then fill out the settings like shown below.  Note that 9050 is the default tor port, if you changed that, of course you should use a different one here too. Also, since this isn't the default port used by the TorBrowser when you use start-tor-browser, you can run both the TorBrowser and the standalone Vidalia at the same time, with entirely different settings, and they won't even interfere with each other!\nFinally, here are a few helpful launchers. Place these in /home/yourname/.local/share/applications and make sure they have a .desktop extension. They will add the Tor Browser and Vidalia to your launcher menus. Of course, you must substitute paths appropriately.\nFor Tor Browser:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Tor Browser\nComment=A secure version of Firefox, from the Tor project\nIcon=firefox\nExec=/path/to/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser\nPath=/path/to/tor-browser_en-US\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=false\nCategories=Network\nName[en_CA]=Tor Browser\nComment[en_CA]=A secure version of Firefox, from the Tor project\n\nFor stand-alone Vidalia:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Vidalia\nComment=A control panel for Tor\nIcon=/path/to/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/icons/updater.png\nExec=/path/to/tor-browser_en-US/App/vidalia\nPath=/path/to/tor-browser_en-US/App\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=false\nCategories=Network\nName[en_CA]=Vidalia\nComment[en_CA]=A control panel for Tor\n\nI hope this solution has helped you as much as it helped me.

Connect to your Ubuntu with a URL like sftp://192.168.1.111, of course you need to use the valid IP address.\n\nA: If the path you're using has spaces, you should use the path in quotes, such as \nscp username@192.168.1.111:\"/path to/myfile.txt\" ./myfile.txt\n\nYet, that didnt work for me.\nAllegedly you should use triple backslashes, such as \n/Users/me/Application\\\\\\ Data/file.txt\n\nBut it worked with path in quotes and double slashes only. \nI am ssh-ing from a mac into another mac though.\n\nA: Proposition of a solution inspired by this answer .\nIn order to copy a file from a remote server to your local home computer you will need to open a terminal on your home computer and write a command structured like this :\nscp -P $PORT_NUMBER $USERNAME@$IP_ADDRESS:$PATH_TO_THE_FILE_TO_COPY $PATH_TO_DESTINATION\n\n\nExplanations :\nscp : \n\nSecure Copy command more infos here\n$PORT_NUMBER: \n\nSSH have a default port set to 22, you can edit this port here ex: 23\n$USERNAME: \n\nthe username access\n$IP_ADDRESS: \n\nthe ip of the remote access\n$PATH_TO_THE_FILE_TO_COPY: \n\nthe path where you want to get the file\n$PATH_TO_DESTINATION: \n\nthe path where you want to copy the file\n\nFor exemple :\nscp -P 22 johndoe@$011.235.813.213:/var/projects/calculator/tests/week-1 /Users/John/transit/\n\n\nAdvices :\n\n*\n\n*Be sure to have the necessary rights on the element you want to copy\nfrom your server.\n\n*⚠️ Init this command from your home computer not from the server ⚠️\n\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*First you have to open the terminal in your local Mac\n\n\n*In the terminal type the below command\nscp user@59.119.31.42:/tmp/server_db_backup/db.sql /Users/username/Desktop/\nIn the above command\n\n*\n\n*\"59.119.31.42\" should be replaced with your server IP\n\n*\"/tmp/server_db_backup/db.sql\" this should be replaced with the path of the file in the server\n\n*\"/Users/username/Desktop/\" this should be replaced with the local path where you are going to save that file\n\nIf you need to pass the certificate to login then run the below command where need to replace the all the above and the path/to/key.pem according to your key location\nscp -i /path/to/key.pem user@59.119.31.42:/tmp/server_db_backup/db.sql /Users/username/Desktop/\n\n", "Q: How to copy dvds using HandBrake under Ubuntu 12.04 I can get handbrake to encode a dvd just fine but after that what do i use to write it to the blank dvdrw? Am using ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: You are encoding from MPEG2 to MPEG4 and from MPEG4 back to MPEG2 format. You are not only loosing quality with unnecessary encoding steps, you are also loosing the original structure of the DVD including menus and depending on your Handbrake settings chapters, subtitles and additional (multichannel) audio tracks.\nHandbrake was not made for copying DVDs.\nFor simple cloning use dvdbackup with --mirror parameter. Then either use your favorite burning software and pray or generate a compliant ISO image yourself and burn it.\nIf resizing is necessary use DeVeDe.\nNote that you might experience issues with the copy protection of some DVDs. While DeCSS works fine, most tools for reading and manipulating the DVD structure expect a working structure and cannot handle errors (that have been deliberately put in there).\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't give the intended screen resolution I have recently created a Ubuntu 12.04.2 64 bit virtual machine on VirtualBox, and I am not very used to Linux (I used Linux Mint for a few weeks some time ago), so please refer the full name of stuff, not just \"the what-not-command\".\nThe problem is I can't set the full resolution my computer supports (I think it is 1366 by 768), \nI have found similar questions and tried most of the respective solutions, thy did not work.\nIf I type xrandr to the terminal I get:\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nScreen 0: minimum 640 x 480, current 1024 x 768, maximum 1024 x 768\ndefault connected 1024x768+0+0 0mm x 0mm\n    1024x768       61.0* \n    800x600        61.0  \n    640x480        60.0  \n\nAs you can see, the maximum is too low. And in the settings of the screen (I mean, with GUI) only 1024x768 and 800x600 appear. I don't remember exactly which answer of those questions, but it was one in the terminal (again, with xrandr) that made the resolution I wanted appear (although it gave an error when selected, not even changing to the 1366x768 resolution first and then back to 1024x768).\n\nA: You'll need to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions in order to be able to use graphics properly. See the Q&A linked below on how to do that.\n\nHow do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM?\n\nBackground info\nThe graphics cards being emulated by the VirtualBox host required optimizations to run properly, smooth and providing integration with the host OS (shared folders, shared clipboard, mouse pointer integration, etc.). These optimizations are accomplished by some cooperation from the driver at the other end of the virtual graphics card: the guest operating system. The Guest Additions contain drivers for several of VirtualBox's features, including the driver (Xorg an kernel module) for the graphics card VirtualBox is emulating.\nWithout the driver, it's just running in a plain limited VESA mode, without any form of hardware acceleration. You'll notice it's a bit sluggish and you won't be able to use all features like high resolutions.\n", "Q: /etc/network/interfaces doesn't always take affect For some reason my eth0 does not have internet on reboot sometimes.

Of course, I have 13.04 now and after installing a clean 13.04 to another computer, I've noticed quite a few differences (plymouth, lightdm, some software behaves differently, etc.). I've done quite a few customizations during the period so it's probably due to that.\nSo I wonder if there is a way to see what's different between my and the clean version. Not the complete file list diff, but perhaps software package differences (synaptic?) or something that will be easier to read and compare. Is there a way?\n\nA: You could compare the list of installed package with the  \".manifest\" file of your distribution, \nFor instance the manifest of 13.04/i386 can be found here :\nhttp://mirrors.mit.edu/ubuntu-releases/13.04/ubuntu-13.04-desktop-i386.manifest \nTo get your installed packages :\n#aptitude search ~i \\!~M\n\nRegarding the customization you could have made there is a tool that can helps you to compare the modified configuration files against the package checksum informations : debsums \n#debsums -ce \n\n(-e to check only the configuration files, -c only the changed files)\nEdit : \nthe packages installed during the year are logged in /var/log/apt. Older history logs are deleted by logrotate. I made that script to get the installed package (take care not to modify the awk patterns when copying). \n# cd /var/opt/log\n#(zcat $(ls -rt history*gz); cat history.log ) | awk '\n /^Commandline: (apt-get install|synaptic|aptitude)/{ \n         cmdl=$0 \n         getline\n         if(/^Install|^Remove/) {\n            print cmdl\n            print\n         }\n  }' | less\n\n\nA: The following script can be used to compare the list of installed package with the \".manifest\" file for a distribution. I developed it with \"ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.manifest\" against a Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS instance having a number of packages added and removed.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# The first parameter to this script is the manifest file name.\n\n# Take the first column of the manifest. This is the name of the\n# package without version information.\ncut --fields=1 $1 | \\\n    sort > \\\n         manifestpkglist.tmp\n\n# Get the list of packages installed on this sysem. Packages with\n# deinstalled status are ignored. Only the first column of the output\n# having the package names is considered.\ndpkg --get-selections | \\\n    grep --invert-match deinstall | \\\n    cut --fields=1 | \\\n    sort > \\\n         installedpkglist.tmp\n\n# Report the differences.\ndiff --side-by-side \\\n     --suppress-common-lines \\\n     manifestpkglist.tmp \\\n     installedpkglist.tmp\n\n# Remove the intermediate files.\nrm --force \\\n   manifestpkglist.tmp \\\n   installedpkglist.tmp\n\nThe script takes the manifest file as input. To run it, make the script executable $ chmod u+x manifest-diff.sh and execute by passing in the manifest file name as the first parameter: $ ./manifest-diff.sh ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.manifest\nA limitation of this script is that it does not make a distinction between packages that were explicitly installed and those that were added to fulfill dependencies. Presumably, such information is available on the system as it must be needed for the autoremove feature of the package manager. A better script would incorporate that information.\n\nA: For some reason the \"!~M\" pattern revoked the \"~i\" pattern, so I got all the packages (including the never-installed ones).\nif you do a \n#  aptitude search ~i\nit all works.\n", "Q: Recovering data from hard disk after an accidental Ubuntu reinstallation My computer got wiped accidentally due to a fresh Ubuntu installation. \nSince the drive contains very important data and codes, it would be really great if the same could be recovered. \nIt is a 2TB hard drive which had Ubuntu 10.10 earlier. It now has a Ubuntu 12.04 installed on it (which I understand occupies ~4GB). The machine has been powered off since.  \nThe installation was done using a usb with the option where the previous ubuntu installation is removed. \nSince installation doesn't take a lot of time, I'm inclined to think that the disk wasn't completely formatted and that most of the data is still there.\nI have no experience with recovery and hence a detailed explanation is very helpful.\nNOTE: I can arrange an additional 2TB hard disk for copying data. My computer has a fast internet connection and I have other computers connected to the network which I may use to access the previous one as well. \n\nA: Exactly the same thing happened to me. I managed to recover all my data with testdisk.\nIn my case I had 2 partitions - the Ubuntu install formatted my drive and deleted my second partition with all my data.\nI simply re-enabled the partition (I think I set it from deleted to logical..) and I could access everything from Ubuntu again.\nIt was also possible to copy the files from within testdisk to another drive/partition.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Can I safely store and display a master password file with AES-encrypted file plus a few simple bash scripts? I would like to set up a couple of bash scripts to encrypt and decrypt a master text file containing passwords for banking, work, etc. for the purpose of editing it and displaying the entries when I need to look something up.  I would prefer to use as few third-party sources as possible, and have a possible solution (?) using just a standard terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*openssl\n\n*text editor of choice\n\n*shred\n\n\nMy question is, can anyone provide a reason why this is not a good idea, from a security point of view?  By that I mean I would like to avoid losing those passwords to casual hacking attempts (I give up if the NSA comes a-knocking).\nLet me explain in more detail.  I have 3 bash scripts listed below, in which $PFILE is a path variable pointing to the directory containing of the password file, and passfile.enc is the encrypted file (the names of the victims have been changed to protect their identity).\n\n\n*\n\n*mypasswds.open: opens a predetermined password file encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption via openssl.  It opens the file externally in, e.g., gedit, so I can easily modify the entries save the updated file.\n#!/bin/bash\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -d -in $PFILE/passfile.enc -out $PFILE/passfile.tmp\ngedit $PFILE/passfile.tmp &\n\n\n*mypasswds.close:  closes, i.e., re-encrypts the file once I am done editing it, and removes the decrypted text file.\n#!/bin/bash\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -in $PFILE/passfile.tmp -out $PFILE/passfile.enc\nshred --remove $PFILE/passfile.tmp\n\n\n*mypasswds.display:  writes the output of passfile.enc to the terminal window, and then immediately removes the decrypted file.  The idea would be to look at the terminal output to recall the password, and then close it immediately after.\n#!/bin/bash\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -d -in $PFILE/passfile.enc -out $PFILE/passfile.tmp\ncat $PFILE/passfile.tmp\nshred --remove $PFILE/passfile.tmp\n\nFor example, if I want to add a new password entry to the file, I run mypasswds.open and enter my (randomly-generated and painstakingly memorized) master password.  The text file opens in, for example, gedit and I update it.  I then save and close the editor, and run mypasswds.close to re-encrypt and remove the temporary, unencrypted file.\nIf I just want to look something up, I run mypasswds.display, look at the output to the terminal to refresh my memory, and immediately close the terminal window.\nQuestions / doubts that come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does terminal output get stored somewhere upon closing the terminal window?  Or is gone forever?\n\n*Is shred --remove a secure option for completely destroying the temporary text file?\n\n*If someone were to obtain the encrypted file, is it possible to decipher, and with what amount of effort?\n\n\nIf this whole idea is for the birds (why?), that is valuable information too!\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: First of all: be aware that anyone with root and / or physical access to your system will be able to intercept any passwords that you type. And there is hardly anything you can do about it. Physical access means root, and root means low level access to hardware.\nAlso, if someone is a user on your system, then he or she is already in your \"inner circle\", since it is much easier to escalate privileges (gain root permissions) than to log in to a random system.\nPersonally, I use a similar system, but I don't keep there any information that would cost me my life's savings or professional reputation -- rather something like my askubuntu password. Also, I implement a bit of primitive, but not obvious encryption (like, omitting a common suffix of all the passwords, replacing certain words or numbers by other words or numbers, or not storing the information that I'm sure I remember and which is crucial, like the name of the service that a certain password refers to etc.).\nAs for shreeding in case of the mypasswd.display command -- why are you creating a temporary file? Why not omit the \"-out\" option and just send it directly to stdout?\nFinally, I have a comic for you: brought to you by XKCD\n", "Q: Sansa Clip Zip does not mount My Sansa Clip Zip MP3 player (uses USB) does not mount.

The fonts are both named \"Monospace\" but they don't look alike, I wonder why.\n\nA: \"Monospace\" is not actually a specific font.

Same with \"Serif\" and \"Sans\".\n", "Q: Is Running programs by address common? I have read some of the things posted here and I keep reading about people running stuff like /foldername/executable -cmd NAME \n(was reading about a programmer using Eclipse, so he was testing something he made)\nI don't see things like that when I run things here (Ubuntu 12.04) because of the launcher and the Ubuntu button at the very top. That and Eclipse indigo has a button for running and testing things it makes.\nJust asking how and why it's common?\n(assuming it's the Terminal[Ctrl+alt+T] but I'm not sure)\n\nA: Not all executables are meaningful when run from a GUI; running them from a CLI is the only way to observe what particular executables do and to interact with them.\n\nA: There is an environmental variable, called PATH. Type echo $PATH in Terminal to see its contents. If some applications reside in folders not in list, you must call them by absolute path, like /opt/games/ponyhunting.

They search network interface eth0 and Ubuntu 13.04 named it p5p1. So my media server doesn't work.\nHow can I change Ubuntu's network config file?\n\nA: In ubuntu 14.04, all I did was this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modify /etc/default/grub and add:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0\"\n\n\n*Then force the create of a new grub.cfgfile\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Then reboot the system\n\nA: The predictable network interface names were introduced with udev-197 and are now standard on many Linux distribution. Although it's possible to go back to the old naming scheme, I'd expect that this causes more troubles than it solves. You can nevertheless try to follow one of the hints on how to go back to unpredictable network interface names given in the following article:\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/\nI don't have 13.04 installed, but I guess that the udev version there is new enough so the kernel command line parameter net.ifnames=0 should work and is probably the most easy solution.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use the Raring install image as a package repo (like the old alternate CD)? I use Kubuntu and recently upgraded to Raring directly from Precise.\nUntil Precise, I always installed the OS using the alternate CD and not the desktop CD, because I could later on mount the image and use it as an offline package repo. For instance if I remove a package installed by the default installer and later I want to install it again, I can just install it from the ISO without needing to download it again.\nHowever, since Quantal the alternate CD no longer exists, so I am not sure how to set up the installed image as a local repo. I mean, doing find . -name \"*.deb\" inside the ISO tree after loopmounting it only shows a few packages like libc6 gcc and such and not the full set of packages that are actually installed -- I presume they are included in pre-installed form inside casper/filesystem.squashfs.\nGiven this situation, is it or is it not possible to use the Raring install images as offline repos? If yes, how?\nThank you!\nEdit: Quite a few people marked this as a dup of: How to use a .iso image as a CD-ROM Repository? but the steps outlined there (that thread is from 2010) do not work with the Raring image. IIUC they would work only with the alternate images and they are not available any more. So anyway I tried those instructions and did:\n\n$ mount | grep loop\n/mnt/sda8/samjnaa/ai/ubuntu/raring/kubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso on /mnt/loop0 type iso9660 (ro)\n$ sudo apt-cdrom -d /mnt/loop0/ add\nUsing CD-ROM mount point /mnt/loop0/\nUnmounting CD-ROM\nWaiting for disc...\nPlease insert a Disc in the drive and press enter\nMounting CD-ROM...\nE: Failed to mount the cdrom.\n\n\nA: I just answered a similar question, You can check the answer over HERE\nTo summarize the steps I described there, \nYou need to make a folder in /media and mount the iso to that folder. You can do so by running the following command as root\nmount /path/to/iso /media/mountFOlder -o loop \n\nNext you should add the following lines to your /etc/fstab file (Always make a backup before making any changes to this file) \n/path/to/iso /media/mountFolder      iso9660 loop,ro,user,noauto 0 0\n\nThen you need to make an entry in /etc/apt/sources.list pointing to the repos in the iso. I don't know what that should be for ubuntu, but for debian it should be\ndeb file:/media/mountFolder/ wheezy main contrib \n\nwhere wheezy is the name of the current release of debian and main and contrib are the two repositorys. You should comment out everything else.\nNext you should run apt-get update as root and then any installation using apt-get install packageName should run without internet now.\nThat's all. If you want to auto mount the iso everytime you boot, you should remove user,noauto from the entry you made in /etc/fstab\n", "Q: How to Install Ubuntu on separate hard drive in a dual boot? I have already installed Windows 7 on C: drive. Now I want to install Ubuntu on E: drive which is a free partition. How do I proceed?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu on a separate drive by booting from a CD/DVD or bootable USB, and when you get to the installation type screen choose something else.  \nThe images are instructional.  Your case might be different.\nBe careful to make sure that you're installing on the right hard drive. If by mistake you install on the C Drive it can cause a problem with Windows.\nJust make sure that you read the instructions, especially which hard drive to install to, since Linux lists drives different than Windows.  Check the capacity of the drive that you want to assign to Ubuntu, and make sure that you have select the correct hard drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I suspect you are using Wubi, which I have never used so this could be completely wrong but you should be able to burn a live CD and boot from it, this might let you select the other disk to install to when choosing the install location.\n\nA: You can also mount different parts of the OS to different drives. I have my / on my 120gb SSD and my /home on my 1tb HDD, this will place all the user home folders there and most apps there (I use up a lot of space and needed to do this).

The action will only run on matching lines. The pattern is written inside slashes: //. \n\n*\n\n*ms$ means each line having the string ms at the end of line $ (The dollar sign indicates that the string should be the last on the line). \n\n*The action $3++ increments the value of the third column by one.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note the {print} action will always run, because there is no pattern for this action, but the {$3++} pattern will only run if the string \"ms\" is found at the end of line. Also the incrementing happens before the print, so all necessary modifications will be performed on time.\n\nA: Input file:\ncat f.txt\n70 17 5 mb\n71 18 6 ms\n72 19 7 ml\n73 20 8 mw\n\nPossible solutions:\n1. awk '$4==\"ms\",$3=$3+1;{print}' f.txt\n70 17 5 mb\n71 18 7 ms\n71 18 7 ms\n72 19 7 ml\n73 20 8 mw\n\n(not sure why but ain't good - target line(s) duplicated)\n\n2. awk '{if ($4==\"ms\"){$3=$3+1}; print}' f.txt\n70 17 5 mb\n71 18 7 ms\n72 19 7 ml\n73 20 8 mw\n\n(worked as expected)\n3. awk '{if ($4==\"ms\"){$3=$3+1} print}' f.txt\n70 17 5 mb\n71 18 7 ms\n72 19 7 ml\n73 20 8 mw\n\n(semicolon \";\" isn't necessary)\n4. awk '{if ($4==\"ms\"){$3=$3+1} else {$3=$3/2}; print}' f.txt\n70 17 2.5 mb\n71 18 7 ms\n72 19 3.5 ml\n73 20 4 mw\n\n(worked as expected and more...)\n5. awk '{if ($4==\"ms\"){$3=$3+1} else {$3=$3/2} print}' f.txt\n70 17 2.5 mb\n71 18 7 ms\n72 19 3.5 ml\n73 20 4 mw\n\n(semicolon \";\" is dispensable)\n\nA: OP answered their own question , when they described the conditions. It should have been translated as so:\n$ awk '$4==\"ms\"{$3=$3+1};1' input.txt                  \n70 17 5 mb\n71 18 7 ms\n72 19 7 ml\n73 20 8 mw\n\nExpression before {} in awk is treated as if statement, so it works just as OP asked: if $4 is \"ms\" , increment $3. The 1 after the {}; simply means print. Sequence is also important, because we check conditions first, and then print.\nAs alternative to awk approach , python can do so as well. The little script below can do the job. It can be turned into one-liner as well, but for readability, I'm providing only the script here\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport sys\n\nwith open(sys.argv[1]) as f:\n     for line in f:\n          words = line.strip().split()\n          if words[3] == \"ms\":\n             words[2] = str(int(words[2]) + 1)\n          print(\" \".join(words))\n\nAnd sample run:\n$ ./increment_field.py input.txt                                                                                  \n70 17 5 mb\n71 18 7 ms\n72 19 7 ml\n73 20 8 mw\n\n", "Q: Error Installing MS

In the folder add a new dword called MaxGLVersion with the value 30002. \nSome have also suggested to install dxfullsetup and msxml6\n\nA: First of all, give up installing Office 2013, since it has a 'Garbage' rating on appdb.\nMy advice to you is to install 2010 (32bit).\nI see you are running an outdated version of wine. It should install correctly with wine1.5 (or 1.6r3). You can do this by adding the wine ppa:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.5\n\nThen install wine-mono by running:\n\nsudo apt-get install wine-mono0.0.8\n\nThen, install it from a clean wine prefix by running:\n\nWINEPREFIX=~/.officewine wine setup.exe\n\nYou can run it afterwards by running:\n\nWINEPREFIX=~/.officewine wine ~/.officewine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Microsoft\\ Office/Office10/winword.exe\n\nIf all else fails you can always try PlayOnLinux or run it from a virtual machine or (my favorite option) try LibreOffice. :-)\n", "Q: 'Core Dumped' while opening Sublime Text 2 I am getting 4xxx Bus error (core dumped) while trying to open Sublime Text by using this command   \n/usr/lib/sublime-text-2/sublime_text --class=sublime-text-2 \"$@\" . \n\nIt was working perfectly until yesterday.

Click the network icon and then Connection Information. See what IP-address the machine has. Is it on the same network as the host? If it's like 192.168.1.xx, can you ping to 192.168.1.1 (if the router has that address)? When I can't browse the internet, it normally means I use NAT for the VM, and it's IP-address is in the 10.x.x.x range. Unless your local network uses the same range, this means you have a local network for host-guest only. \n", "Q: gcc segmentation fault on Ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to compile a C program on Ubuntu precise 12.04.\nHere's the program:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n  printf(\"Hello World!\");\n  return 0;\n}\n\nMy gcc version is 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5).\nInitially it did not find cc1 so I added a soft link.\nNow I get this message when I try to compile:\ngcc: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault (program cc1)\n\nCompiling the same program with g++ works fine.\nI tried reinstalling build-essential, but to no avail.\nWhat am I missing?\nEDIT: I tried reinstalling according to @gertyvdijk's suggestion.

The BIOS/EFI is American Megatrends Aptio with the last update from 2013-07-12 (version 10F).

Since the changes GRUB made in MBR during the legacy mode installation does not influence the UEFI booting, this works. Nevertheless, it is quite a pain, to go to bios for OS switch.\nThe last line seems to be from grub2, so maybe I will report an bug later.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. My BIOS rebooted immediately when forcing UEFI boot. It was because the pen drive did not have a UEFI bootloader. I used a GPT formatting utility called rufus to flash the image to the drive, and it worked like a charm!

In version 21 it was there, and I did disable it because I do not like to have the menus in the menu bar, but rather have the Firefox button next to the tabs.\nI did search for an answer, but didn't find anything most likely because version 22 just came out.

To debug this we may boot into a shell with administrative rights and networking enabled as depicted here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I boot into a root shell?\nFrom there we can issue all commands from a command line, edit configuration files using a command line editor, update drivers, install or remove applications, and upgrade our distribution with bugfixes or security updates.\nFor installing the GNOME session fallback, after we had booted into a root shell with networking enabled we may issue the following commands:\n# apt-get update # refreshes our aplications cache\n# apt-get dist-upgrade # updates applications and the kernel\n# apt-get install gnome-session-fallback # or any other application\n\nPlease be careful what you do in this root shell, because you are now root with the powers to do anything to your system even break it in case you made an error.\nPlease also note that in future releases GNOME session fallback will probably be called GNOME session flashback but it is at present uncertain how long this will be supported.

The underlying hardware and the basic configuration varies between each type of hardware and we would like to have a preseed for each environment.\nIs that possible with MAAS?\nThanks.\n\nA: It's not currently possible to have different preseeds, however you can work around it by using tags.\nIf you tag your nodes appropriately, you can customise the preseed templates to use that tag to do the different things that you require.\n", "Q: I want to change from 64 bit Ubuntu 12.10 to 32 bit I had installed Ubuntu 12.10 amd64 Desktop on my laptop, but I realized my laptop's hardware is not meant for 64 bit Ubuntu. (I also have Windows 7 installed in another partion)\nIs there any way to convert to a 32 bit Ubuntu?\nEDIT:\nI have a single core processor ( I don't even think its a 64 bit one)\n\nA: I've figured it out.\nFirst I had to uninstall Ubuntu and restoring to Windows 7: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSYGkSptSy4\nThen after deleting the partion where Ubuntu was installed I inserted my Ubuntu 12.10 i386 disc and installed it on the same old partion.\n", "Q: Dashed borders of my window manager (XFce) I upgraded to the latest Xubuntu 13.03 and sometimes borders of my windows (regardless the application) become strangely dashed. I managed to make a screenshot:\n\nThe screenshot is with Clearlooks-Phenix theme, but the issue is not theme-dependent. I tried multiple themes including the default one for Xubuntu and these dashed borders still appear.\nDashes appear and disappear - they are not permanent. It's annoying. Does anyone know why such dashing appears and how to fix it?\n\nUpdate: Adding my compositor settings:\n\n\nA: (Originally posted by user226952 at Dashed borders of my window manager (XFce) - Solution.)\nI ran into the same problem as posted here and I found out that the problem only exists on my Intel video laptops (Nvidia was fine) and occurred only with themes having window borders with more than 1px width.\nMy solution was to create a file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf with the content :\nSection \"Device\"\n   Identifier  \"Intel Graphics\"\n   Driver      \"intel\"\n   Option      \"AccelMethod\"  \"uxa\"\nEndSection\n\nThis switches off sandy bridge acceleration and turns back to slower but reliable uxa acceleration.\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 1501 no wired/wireless w/12.04 or13.04 I don't know what to do. Every install of either 13.04 and 12.04 on my Dell does not have a working wired or wireless internet connection. However, if I am running from USB in the trial mode I have working internet through a wired connection using the same ethernet cord.\nI honestly at this point do not know what I can do to fix this issue as I have gone through every possible fix I have found here and in other places.\n\nA: I had the same issue which I could not fix. I eventually fixed it using the method below.\nIn package manager remove bcmwl-kernal-source, then reboot. You should find the wired LAN connection then works.\nTo get the wireless working install linux-firmware-nonfree then reboot again. You will probably need to enable the adapter with Fn + F2 but should work after that.\n", "Q: Cant install Ubuntu. How do you format a Windows HDD I have an HP 630, and would like to install Ubuntu. \nAll goes well until the point where you have to choose how you want Ubuntu installed. I choose on the whole HDD, I want Windows off the HDD. \nI press enter and about 5 seconds later the CD tray open and the computer reboots. This happens over and over. \nHow do I format this Window HDD completely to install Ubuntu 13.04. \nI have tried 3 different CD's and the same thing happens each time.\n\nA: If you don't want windows, then when you get to the installation type screen, just choose Erase disk and install Ubuntu.  If you want more control on size of partition and swap, then choose Something else, which will let you do manual partitioning.  \n \n", "Q: Why doesn't usage of '*' always work on zsh? I ran the following command on zsh\nsudo apt-get install rhythmbox* \n\nIt produced an error, when I ran the same command in bash it worked. Why does this happen?\nHow can I make the above command work on zsh?\n\nA: Here's what happens\nBash will try to evaluate the pattern rhythmbox* on the current working directory. As it is very unlikely there will be any file or directory starting with the sequence of rhythmbox, it will not expand, but Bash will provide it as an argument to apt-get here.\nNote that if you have a file there with the name rhythmbox-test then it won't work as it will be expanded and rhythmbox-test will be provided as the argument to apt-get.\nSolution: escape or quote it!\nSo, to reliably use the patters in apt-get in a Bash shell, you should always escape it. Use quotes or the backslash, e.g.\nsudo apt-get install rhythmbox\\* \n\nor\nsudo apt-get install \"rhythmbox*\"\n\nAbout the same goes for zsh.\nThe expansion of the pattern is called globbing.\nDemo\ntouch aa ab  # creates files aa and ab\nls a*        # lists both files as Bash provided ls two arguments.\nls 'a*'      # No such file or directory. Bash provided literally a* to ls.\nls a\\*       # No such file or directory. Same as above.\n\n\nA: You need to use quotes to prevent zsh from expanding the '*' (you want apt-get to expand the * )\nsudo apt-get install \"rhythmbox*\"\n\n\nA: Use ^rhythmbox instead (with ^). Usually avoid * when installing or removing packages.\nEven if you quote it so the shell passes it unchanged, * doesn't do what most people expect when it appears in a package name with most apt/apt-get actions, including install, remove, and purge. Avoid * in the pattern that follows these actions unless you know precisely what it does and why. Usually * is not what you actually want and this is one  of those times when it seems you do not. * does not mean \"any characters\" in this context.\nThe proper way to tell apt-get to install all packages whose names start with rhythmbox is:\nsudo apt-get install ^rhythmbox\n\nThis also works with apt install. Similarly, if you needed to remove such packages, you could specify ^rhythmbox after the remove or purge action.\n^rhythmbox matches all package names that start with rhythmbox because ^ is the start-of-line (or, in this case, start-of-string) anchor.\n\nThe problem with * in the name of a package to install or remove is that\napt and apt-get interpret it as a regular expression rather than a glob. In a regular expression, * means \"zero or more of the preceding item.\" So when you run sudo apt-get install with rhythmbox\\*, 'rhythmbox*', \"rhythmbox*\", or (when the shell doesn't expand *) rhythmbox*, you are actually telling apt-get to install every package with rhythmbo anywhere in its name.\n\n\n*\n\n*Not rhythmbox, rhythmbo, because the x is to appear any number of times--zero or more times.\n\n*Not at the beginning of the name, or as the whole name, but anywhere in its name.\n\n\nIn the specific case of this particular package, this will likely not cause huge problems, as there are probably few packages that have rhythmbo in their names but don't start with rhythmbox. But with packages whose names are shorter, especially when using the remove or purge actions, this is often disastrous.\n\nThe main exception to this is apt list. The list action does interpret * and ? as globbing characters rather than as regular expression metacharacters. So you can search for packages whose names start with rhythmbox like this:\napt list rhythmbox\\*\n\n(Or with 'rhythmbox*' or \"rhythmbox*\".)\nBut to install such packages--and not install more packages than you mean to--you still need to use:\nsudo apt install ^rhythmbox\n\nOr you can just pass the specific package names you need. Using apt list can help you find them.\n", "Q: my laptop touchpad stops working during the live demo I m completely new to all of this...\nI just want to install ubuntu because it is suppose to get rid of most of the virus problems, so anyway I was following online instructions to install ubuntu alongside windows 7 these are my laptop specifications.\n\nI tried booting with a pendrive using netbootin and other similar program but once I boot the laptop in ubuntu I click try without installing button and go to desktop then my mouse stops working. \nWhat am I supposed to do or what am I doing wrong??\nAlso please suggest a thread for proper installation of ubuntu alongside Windows 7. Thank you.\n\nA: What actually happens is when you are starting a live demo of Ubuntu, it changes bios settings internally. I have tried to reset all Bios settings but the issue was still there.\nTo reset bios, either reinstall BIOS or update BIOS.It can be downloaded from your laptop manufacturer website. For me, it did the magic. I hope, it will work for you also.\n", "Q: Cannot login to server after file permissions change! I am using Ubuntu server. I ran:\n\nchmod -R 700 /\n\nwhen I was logged in as root. Now when I try to login as my normal user I immediately get kicked out. Is there anyway to log back in to the server whether it is root or whoever so that I can change the permissions? or am I totally screwed? I dont think I have root access enabled in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. I do have physical access to the server.  I really need some help here. \n\nA: You are screwed. If you have physical access, the best thing you can do as a newbie user is complete re-installation. Even if you would find a way to log in, you will not be able to restore rights right.  Rights are not uniform, and there are lots of files. Never mess with rights at large. I suppose you have no backups, do you?\nTo get access:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in some bootable USB stick, (not sure if Ubuntu live has ssh\nenabled, but many rescue liveCDs surely do).\n\n*Then reboot the machine with this stick, and you will be able to ssh into that system. \n\n*From it, mount ubuntu disk to, say, /mnt/ubuntu, and do command chroot /mnt/ubuntu /bin/bash Voila, you are in your screwed Ubuntu as root.  \n\n\nAgain, I suggest you use this access only to backup data and prepare headless installation. If you are not listening to advises, you can create root in your server: passwd root.

I am looking at building a new system and want to avoid hardware problems. My last system used the 950 phenom but it looks like there is nothing from AMD anymore besides FX cpus.\nAlso, what Nvidia are you using?

I can login, but I can't download the games I bought before.\nThey are in my Library but I cant install them as there is no button. \nHope someone can help me.\nBTW: I am not a native speaker so I am sorry about mistakes. \n\nA: Not all games exist on the Linux platform yet.  As such, most of the Windows games probably won't be installed or downloaded because of the lack of a Linux port.\n", "Q: Nautilus File Manager not working I'm just installed ubuntu 12.04 and was customizing my Main Menu using the standard application Ubuntu provides for that\n\nand eliminated the entry Files it contained.  Unfortunately this resulted not only in eliminating the entry for the main menu but also in uninstalling the default File Manager Canonical ships with ubuntu.\nFact is that now the only way to open a directory is to launch Nautilus via terminal.  If I try to access it from the Places menu I'll be prompted with the following error:\n\nAs you can see the problem is that for some reason the File Manager is not registered any more for handling the directory files.\n\nI looked for some file managers on the Ubuntu Software center and found a couple ones that helped me fix the problem, \n\n\nbut none of these is the default one I was using before.\nHow can I restore the one I that was provided with the fresh install of Ubuntu?\n\nA: You probably only edited the settings for your user, not system wide. If this is the case, a system wide reinstall of Nautilus will not help you solve your issue. All changes to the menu should be stored in the folder ~/.local/share/applications - check that folder if you find any file with \"nautilus\" or \"files\" in the name. Try to move this file to a different folder (in order to copy it back if it was the wrong one). In the worst case move all files from ~/.local/share/applications to a different location, and copy them back in, one by one, until you find the entry causing you troubles. It might be necessary to wait a few seconds for changes in that folder to apply, or you might even have to log out and back in again.\nAlso, there's a folder named ~/.local/share/mime/applications that contains file type association settings that have been changed from the system default.\n\nA: Default file manager name is Nautilus. It is located in a package with same name. Just reinstall the package with apt-get. I think you are wrong in claiming that you have deleted it, however. It is protected as any Linux app is. \n\nA: first install it to be able to purge.\n    sudo apt-get install nautilus\n\nPurging will help you remove the software as if it was never installed.\n    sudo apt-get purge nautilus\n\nInstall it again, you may also want to clear your cache, just to be sure.\n    sudo apt-get install nautilus\n\nWhat I think the first problem was, in the settings of your desktop environment, find the place to choose default application for opening files. I do not know particular commands for every DE.\nThen, I think you shall be fine.\n", "Q: Tools and techniques for diagnosing heating problems I've just installed ubuntu 13.04 on a dell M6700. The laptop becomes too hot to keep on your lap after short usage.\nWhat are the best tools I can use to find out what the problem is and solve the issue?\n\nA: Nvidia Quadro is guilty. You must install proprietary drivers and after that read more on tuning your video card for lower power consumption. Without it it is just in gaming mode - eats battery, produces heat. \nDoes it have Nvidia Optimus technology?

Instead, it is very consistent about the 2x 256 MB of memory being installed.\n\nWhen I was too much applications, it was telling me that I had 1,49 GB used (and then it shot down).\n\nYour statement about \"seeing\" 1,5 GB of memory being in use in Windows was probably about the virtual memory in use. This includes the memory on disk (pagefile, or in Linux-terms: swap).\nBy default you'll see most OS installers create a swap area of twice the amount of the physical RAM. In your Ubuntu installation you'll also see a swap line:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:           365        360          5          0         59         97\n-/+ buffers/cache:        203        161\nSwap:          767         13        754\n\nIn the output shown above the total available memory is 1022MB, the total physical memory installed is 365MB.\nIn Windows XP the task manager is showing an even more confusing view:\nThe \"PF Usage\" data is the amount of pagefile (swap) in use - it has nothing to do with the physical memory installed. As you can see, the numbers below do not represent the amount shown (334 MB).\n\n", "Q: I cannot use Plugin Finder Service to download my needed plugins, Java and Adobe Flash Player I have tried downloading them, and I am not 100% sure how to use the terminal.

And I didn't get what all other mean, you can do it in Files easily.\n\nA: To delete all empty subfolders, you can use the find command:\nfind -type d -empty  -delete\n\n-type d means to only search for directories, -empty and -delete are self explanatory.\nTo copy the path of the current folder in the Nautilus filemanager to clipboard, simply right click on the folder name in the toolbar and select copy. If you want to display the current directory on the command line, the pwd command does this.\nTo invert the selection in Nautilus, use the \"invert selection\" option in the menu (depending on your Nautilus version it might be in the edit menu, or in the general one).\nThere is also an option to select by pattern, it can be accessed by pressing CTRL+s.\nI have no idea, what you mean by \"split and join folders\".\nTo list the files inside a folder, you can use the ls command in terminal.\nTo bulk rename, you can either install a tool like Thunar file manager, or use the command line. Since there are many possible kinds of bulk rename, I can't give a general command line solution, I can just recommend to learn the basics of bash scripting and also to have a look at sed and awk.

You can kill all the processes related to a specific cron task using the Session ID, so in the example above you should kill Session ID 4289:\npkill -s 4289\n\n\nA: To kill a process manually one way is to use pkill. pkill will stop all processes that have the following pattern in its name. for example to stop all wget processes use:\nsudo pkill wget\n\n\nA: change your cronjob like this\n00 10 * * * /usr/bin/wget LINK && shutdown -h now\n\nThis should work, because the && means that the second command only gets executed, when the first one was finished correctly (returning status 0 to the console/system), which shouldn't be the case (because the process got killed by the user and it should return another value then 0).\n", "Q: Ubuntu laptop boot without USB or CD I would like to load Ubuntu onto my old laptop but it will only boot from hard drive/SSD, FDD or LAN.Is there a way to load Ubuntu, demo or real, from the Ubuntu web site?\n\nA: You can use the Network Installer.\nThe network installer lets you install Ubuntu over the network. This is useful, for example, if you have an old machine with a non-bootable CD-ROM or a computer that can’t run the graphical interface-based installer, either because they don’t meet the minimum requirements for the live CD/DVD or because they require extra configuration before the graphical desktop can be used, or if you want to install Ubuntu on a large number of computers at once.\nTo download it, see Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) Netboot\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes at installation-dialog and at live-boot i´m quite new to ubuntu/linux, because i prefered using windows, yet.\nNow i have a older notebook that runs very slow with windows xp and consumples a lot of battery.\nSo i choosed to use a more efficient operating system - ubuntu.\nAs a fan of the new interface of ubuntu i definitly was about to install 12.04 LTS.\nWell.. my Notebook is to old for it because its 32bit CPU doesn´t support PAE.\nSo i tried to install:\n10.04 LTS, 11.04, 12.04 Non-PAE, 12.04 via Network (mini.iso), xubuntu 12.04\nAlways i386-version\nBut always when i want to install, the dialog freezes, means i can´t click anywhere but the mouse is still moveable.\nWhen i try to boot from stick and select live-boot it loads ubuntu and after a few seconds it looks like this:\nhttps://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=5BB06F365D867D6A!405&authkey=!AMB0D4NdNdeaOBk\nHardware information:\nCPU: Pentium M 725, RAM: 512 MB, GPU: ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 (64MB), HDD: 80GB\nThanks for your awesome help in advance :)\n\nA: You should not use ancient Ubuntu. Use modern Xubuntu or Lubuntu instead. Unity will not run on this revered veteran even if you manage to install it. I have Zenwalk Linux running on such machines OK.\n", "Q: How do I bundle several units of 3G modems to improve bandwidth? How do I bundle let's say five to ten units of 3G modems in order to improve the download speed? I'd like to do this on Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 LTS.\nIn the end, I would like to use the Ubuntu server as an Internet gateway and connect a Macbook Pro via Wireless LAN.\nIt would also be nice if the MacBook can do load balancing between WiFI and USB modem directly connected.\nPlease, also recommend the USB modem models as well as the line binding scripts.\n\nA: To do this you will have to use some proxy with load-balancing capabilities. Squid is a default, if awkward, choice. However, explaining how to configure it is more than a paragraph or two. So read manuals and apply head. \nThis will improve the speed of simultaneous access to different files. To improve the speed of downloading single file, you will have to add the use of some downloader, like KGet, and no proof it will work.

Is there anyway to grant the mount command permission to a user? I seems impossible and the user must be a sudoer. However I want to know is it possible to create a group which has admin permission (only for mount) and then add the user to this group?\n\nA: I guess this first link is not strange for you :\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-add-user-to-group/\nThere is then this link for users added to groups with help of acl :\nhttp://knackforge.com/blog/vannia/setup-default-group-permissions-new-files-created-under-specific-directory-debianubuntu\nWith acl you can adjust partitions too.\nInstall acl first - if not done already:\n\nsudo apt-get install acl\n\nAssumed your linux-partition for root(sudo) is at sda2 - so then you need to edit /etc/fstab for device resp. partition sda2 and this looks there like before editing :\n\n/dev/sda2    /    auto    defaults,nobootwait    0    2\n\nafter editing :\n\n/dev/sda2    /    auto    defaults,nobootwait,acl    0    2\n\nNow re-mount this partition with :\n\nsudo mount -o remount /\n\nWhen you changed /etc/fstab - you normally need to reboot :\n\nsudo reboot\n\nNow you can add a group, and within this group you add some users - e.g. group for developers with :\n\nsudo addgroup developer\nsudo adduser lewinsky developer\n\n(lewinsky as example for member of group for developers - you have to repeat latter command for each user of group for developers)\nNow you need to set acl for the folder ( you as user resp. boss for the group and the developers ) :\nSet ACL for the folder:\n\nsudo setfacl -d -m \"u:nobody:rwx,g:developer:rwx,o::r-x\" -R /home/you/\n\n(this means.. you don't have any preference for the \"user\" a new file will be owned by -- defaults to the actual user creating the file, but the user's permissions given - rwx will be applied; group will be forced to \"developer\" with all permissions for the group; other users will just have read & execute permissions).\nIn case you already have contents in the folder, you could use this to change existing file's permissions to make it sharable within the group:\n\nsudo chgrp developer -R /home/you\nsudo chmod g+rwsx -R /home/you\n\nNow here comes this missing answer for a certain user allowed to use commands like mount:\n\nsudo adduser lewinsky admin\n\nThis would mean too, that lewinsky is the boss within the group developer and may use\nelse commands except mount.\nIf you want lewinsky only to be allowed to use the single command mount - it would look like this :\n\nsudo -u username command\n\nalso\n\nsudo -u lewinsky mount\n\n\nA: You can edit sudo config. Just type sudo visudo in Terminal, and you are in it. read man visudo and edit config.\nIf, however, you only want to give access to particular disk, edit the /etc/fstab. Add users option to mount options listed there. After that use chmod 755 /mnt/disk1 on its mount point. \n", "Q: Error copying images from camera using Nautilus Since I upgraded t 13.04 I can no longer copy images from a flash card located in my Canon camera. \nI can connect to the camera using USB, I can browse and view images, however I am unable to copy any images to my PC.\nThe error message: Operation not supported by backend\nThe strange thing is that I can copy folders, just not contents...\nAny ideas?\nUbuntu 13.04 64bit\nKernel: 3.9.7-030907-generic\nThanks\nAdditional:\nI do not think the camera is mounting properly.

I recently wiped my hard disk with a fresh Ubuntu installation. I'm planning to use Testdisk to recover the files. \nHowever, since I do not have prior experience, I feel it would be safer if I could keep an image of the hard drive as well. That way, I can work on the image to avoid wrecking the original drive even more. \nI have two questions:\n1) Could you suggest a tool for the same?\n2) Since I need the image for recovery, I don't want to overwrite the hard disk anymore than it already has been. Hence, could you comment if the tool would affect the hard drive in any way (if it is run via a usb)?\n\nA: You need to have some things prepared first:\n\n\n*\n\n*your original hard-drive from where you will read all the bits (you have this one, obviously);\n\n*a separate hard-drive where you will write the backup - this one needs to be already partitioned & formatted and must have ENOUGH free space to host your backup file (if your original hard-drive has 80 GB, you must have at least 80 GB free on a partition of the backup hard-drive to create the backup);\n\n*a Linux LiveCD/LiveDVD/LiveUSB to boot from - it must have the \"dd\" utility. I guess using the CD/DVD/USB you already used to install Ubuntu should be ok.\n\n\nSteps:\n1) make sure both hard-drives are connected to the computer you will be using;\n2) boot from the LiveCD/LiveDVD/LiveUSB and check what drive is what - let's say from now on that original drive is sda and backup drive is sdb. Let's also say the backup drive has only 1 partition, sdb1.\n3) make sure nothing from sda is mounted;\n4) make sure the backup partition (/dev/sdb1) is mounted (let's say to /media/sdb1);\n5) you need to run from a terminal the \"dd\" command like this (it means: \"copy bit-by-bit the whole sda hard-drive to file backup.img in /media/sdb1 using a block-size of 1 MB\"):\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/media/sdb1/backup.img bs=1M\n\nPlease know that, depending on your original drive size, step 5) will take less or more (or a lot of) time.\nGood luck and let us know what happens!\nNote: you can always restore from the backup file by using:\ndd if=/media/sdb1/backup.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M\n\nAgain, please make sure to check what drive is what - sdb is the backup drive, sda is the drive where the backup will be restored.\n\nA: I heard dd can do it: link -- but I never used it\n", "Q: Is it possible to setup an interface with both DHCP and a static IP?

I don't want the shared folder to be accessible by anyone on the system, I want it to be accessible just to a restricted set of users.\nHow to I do that?\n\nA: Taken from this excellent post on Ubuntu Forums by Morbius1.\nThe classic Linux way of doing this sort of thing goes something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the shared folder:\nsudo mkdir /home/Shared\n\n\n*Create the new user's group:\nsudo addgroup newgroup\n\n\n*Change ownership of the shared folder to the new group:\nsudo chown :newgroup /home/Shared\n\n\n*Add your desired users to that group:\nsudo adduser user1 newgroup\n\nRepeat for all users.\nNow you have some decisions to make about what you want those users to be able to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*[a] All group users can add to and delete from the folder and can read and but not write to each others files:\nsudo chmod 0770 /home/Shared\n\n\n*[b] Same as above but only the owner of the file can delete it:\nsudo chmod 1770 /home/Shared\n\n\n*[c] All group users can add to and delete from the folder and can read and write to each other's files:\nsudo chmod 2770 /home/Shared\n\n\n*[d] Same as [c] except only the owner of the file can delete it:\nsudo chmod 3770 /home/Shared\n\nA 1 in the first position of the chmod command is the sticky bit which prevents deletion of a file to anyone other than the owner.\nA 2 in the first position of the chmod command is the setgid bit which forces all new or copied files to have the group of that folder.\nA 3 in the first position of the chmod command is the combination of the sticky (1) & setgid (+2) bits.\nThere is one caveat to all this as far as the setgid bit is concerned. All new files created in and any files copied to that folder will in fact inherit the group of the folder. But not files moved to that folder. Moved files retain the ownership from wherever they were moved from. One way to get past this problem is to use bindfs.\nFinally if you want others outside the group to be able to see the files but not change them change the final 0 in the chmod command to a 5 eg: \nsudo chmod 0775 /home/Shared\n\n", "Q: is there a DIGITAL LITERACY I am in Africa, and I wish to know if there's any project that introduces new users to Ubuntu?

I just noticed that if I copy a file to the share after mounting, my Ubuntu client immediately make \"nobody\" be the owner, and the group \"no group\" has read and write, with everyone else as read-only.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Turns out that I need to add a local (client) UID to the mount line in FSTAB to make this work. I arrived at this via sheer brute force:\n//192.168.0.5/storage /media/myname/TK-Public/ cifs guest,uid=myuser,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,noperm 0 0\n\n\nA: You are almost there. \nOpen FSTAB by using: \nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nIn the last line ( or on of the last lines) place:\n//192.168.0.5/storage /media/myname/TK-Public/ cifs username=YOURUSERNAME,password=YOURPASSWORD,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777\n\n*** (this is all one long line)\nCtrl-X to close, Y to save and Enter to seal the deal.\nNow reboot by:\nsudo reboot\n\nAnd you should have full control of the network share on your Linux device!\n\nA: CIFS does not generally have any concept of user and group, so mounting a cifs share will default to showing user and group as 'nobody':\ndrwxdrwxdrwx. 3 nobody nobody 0 Sep 29 09:00 .\ndrwxdrwxdrwx. 9 nobody nobody 0 Sep 29 09:00 ..\n\nSince you are not 'nobody' Linux will not let you write to anything that doesn't have 0777 permission unless you use sudo. To fix this, add uid=mylogin,gid=mygroup to fstab and it will make the share appear as if it is your own directory:\ndrwxdrwxdrwx. 3 mylogin mygroup 0 Sep 29 09:00 .\ndrwxdrwxdrwx. 9 mylogin mygroup 0 Sep 29 09:00 ..\n\nYou now have full control without the need for sudo.\nThis not not actually changing anything on the server, since the server is not enforcing anything. It is telling Linux to pretend that you are the owner and give you unrestricted access.\n\nA: I had this problem and it was because the user of the share did not own it.

My media is shared via SMB and NFS, but I use NFS primarily for the XBMC frontends because the lower overhead translates into significantly better performance.\nWhat I Want:\nWhat I would like to do is to create two NFS shares to my media files.  One share I would like to be read/write, and the other share I would like to be read only.  This way, I can set up a frontend for my roommate, for example, where he can access the files for viewing, but not screw anything up.\nSince I can't create two identical NFS shares, one read/write and one read-only, I tried to create two mounts to differentiate them.\nIn /etc/fstab, I have the following device mounted:\n/dev/stb1 /mnt/Media ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nAnd in /etc/exports, I have the following NFS share:\n/mnt/Media *(rw,async,all_squash,insecure,anonuid=1001,anongid=122,no_subtree_check)\n\nThe above works fine for read/write access.  My intention was to create a second, read-only mount, and then export it via NFS as /mnt/Media_ReadOnly.  So I've tried to create the second mount as follows:\n/dev/stb1 /mnt/Media_ReadOnly ext4 ro,auto,user,noexec 0 0\n\nbut I get an error:\nmount: according to mtab, /dev/sdb1 is mounted on /mnt/Media\n\nSo I guess I can't mount the same device twice?\nHow can I export the same path via NFS in a read-only format?\n\nA: You cannot have two identical targets in a mount, full stop. Neither in NFS nor in the system.\nBut what you can do is to create a dummy directory structure, for example /export/rw and /export/rw/ro. Your data is in the latter; the former only contains the directory ro. Then you export /export/rw over NFS as read/write, and /export/rw/ro over NFS with read only permissions. I did not test it, but it should work. However, I'm not sure it is such a good idea.\nAlternatively, consider tuning Samba performance -- actually, this would be my first choice. It should actually be faster than NFS (or at least not that much slower), at least according to documentation (and my anecdotal evidence; but then, I'm not reliable, since after years administrating an NFS-based solution I really hate this protocol).

On a fresh install (13.04) I see a strange mix of languages in Software Center\n\nThe menu (like my system language) is in English, but the descriptions are in German. I want the descriptions in English too.\nI am using a german keyboard and have German installed too (for giving support to students with German as system language :-))\nIn system settings I have moved German below English - so it should be ignored, I have logged out after that.\nI have cleared the \"Software Center Cache\" with Ubuntu Tweak. The picture remains the same.\n\nA: The Software Center doesn't store language settings for package information, but pulls them from apt. apt builds its backend based on the installation language. This has been reported as a bug.\nIf you have removed languages that you no longer need, you can reset the translations that apt-get looks for with:\nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf && sudo apt-get update\n\nAt least one person at the above-mentioned bug report, says the problem of apt showing package descriptions in a language that is now different from the one you are using was fixed by first choosing the language you need in Language Settings and then reinstalling the Software Center:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install software-center\n\n\nA: My guess is that the system wide language is still German.

See the below screenshot:\n\nWhat is that \"web seed\", shown in the picture (which kind of seeders?)? Is it safe?\n\nA: \n[Web Seeds are the] location on the web for any files within the torrent. If you add such locations, then peers with ability to use webseeding can download from these sources.\nWhen you author a torrent you can add any locations where you have uploaded the contents, or existing web locations. The source must be identical files unless there are webseed links for all the included files, you may not be able to download 100% of the file from webseed because of boundary data that's spread across files. Using the align file boundary option will take care of that shortfalling, but will result in creation of padding files, which are harmless, but [which] some find objectionable.\n\nSource: this Comet Forums post\n\nWhat seeds give the torrent client the ability to download torrent pieces/data from an http source in addition to the swarm. So if you have a file somewhere on the internet, you can simply add its link to your torrent. Now if the swarm is weak, the torrent client will fetch data from the http source. The advantage, of course, is that a publisher can create a torrent of a file which is already hosted on his server and not worry about seeding it full time, while the user can obtain the data directly from the http source or through the torrent. Either way, the user will get the data from the http source. However, if the torrent becomes popular and self-sustainable, the torrent client will fetch data from the swarm and only use the http seed for pieces which are not available or are deficient in the swarm.\nThis is a very good approach towards file distribution which can be used by artists, producers who distribute their content online. Using web seeds, they can keep their torrents alive for as long as their servers are up. A perfect balance between load-balancing and content availability.\n\nSource: post by Keshav Khera\n\nA: According to the wikipedia page:\n\nWeb seeding was implemented in 2006 as the ability of BitTorrent clients to download torrent pieces from an HTTP source in addition to the swarm. The advantage of this feature is that a website may distribute a torrent for a particular file or batch of files and make those files available for download from that same web server; this can simplify long-term seeding and load balancing through the use of existing, cheap, web hosting setups. In theory, this would make using BitTorrent almost as easy for a web publisher as creating a direct HTTP download. In addition, it would allow the \"web seed\" to be disabled if the swarm becomes too popular while still allowing the file to be readily available.\n\nAs for the safety aspect, I would presume it is of no higher risk than normal torrent.\n\nA: While normal seeds are other peer to peer users, a webseed is hosted on a server. Webseeds are used to guarantee the availability of the download, even if no other p2p users are sharing it.\n", "Q: cloning disks with Lubuntu 12.04 lead to LVDS interface error I want to ask about a problem I´m having when I want to clone an image of Linux Lubuntu 12.04 from one PC to another.

The specs are 1 GB RAM, 1.6 GHz Intel Atom.\nI'm looking for the fastest version of GNU/Linux that is fully functional for this netbook. I do NOT want to run from a USB as my netbook is purely for Linux. So far the only thing I've been able to get to run correctly (with small issues) is Ubuntu 12.04 with Xubuntu interface.\n\nA: I have a Samsung N150 Plus which have an Intel Atom N455 1.66GHz and 1GB DDR3 (all the specs here) and I'm using Lubuntu since 11.04. I use it sometimes to read PDF, navigate with Chromium, write LibreOffice texts, play Spotify music, ear practice with GNU Solfege and watch videos (offline 720p videos without problems, some 1080p are perfectly decodified).\nI tried Unity (Ubuntu 13.04), but is so heavy for this computer if you want to use Spotify and Firefox at the same time, for example. Same with GNOME 3. GNOME 2 also works perfect (by default before using Unity in Ubuntu), but I think that is not an option nowadays. Also, you could try Xubuntu (I use it in my main computer with Ubuntu Studio) and seems similar to Lubuntu using resources (XFCE maybe is a little bit heavier but incomparable to KDE, GNOME or Unity).\nSo, with my experience with that kind of computers I'll recommend you to use Lubuntu, but you can also try Xubuntu (or Ubuntu Studio if you use that computer for multimedia development) or even Ubuntu (Unity) with classic environment. Install the release version that you want. I always use LTS versions because are more polished than the latest ones, but maybe there are things in the latest release that makes the difference with your hardware.\n\nA: I have a Netbook, an Asus EeePC with AMD C-60 APU. I'm running Gentoo on it, since source based distributions like Gentoo are definitely the fastest ones. Gentoo might be challenging, because there are many things that can (and will) go wrong with a Gentoo installation. If you are patient (compiling webkit can take a night or so), have fun playing with a Linux system, customizing the kernel config and fine tweaking sytem settings, Gentoo definitely is the distribution for you - like the Gentoo website says: \"Gentoo is all about choice\". If you just need a system that just works and you don't want to invest much time in, then don't use Gentoo.\nIn such a case, I strongly recommend Debian Wheezy, which I had installed on the Netbook before I switched to Gentoo. Debian is very similar to Ubuntu (actually, Ubuntu is based on the \"unstable\" Debian version), but the Debian developers care more about stability than about new software-versions. Therefore, the just released Debian Wheezy has many software versions, that Ubuntu had in 12.04 (and some even older ones). The great thing about Debian is, that if one selects a lightweight desktop (like Xfce) when booting the installation CD (even before the installer is started, directly in the GRUB menu, under advanced options), it comes with even more lightweight software than the light Ubuntu versions. Also, I found that some programs are in the Debian repositories, which are missing under Ubuntu. There are drawbacks of course, the most important being that Debian Wheezy uses an older libc than Ubuntu 12.04, so Ubuntu 12.04 packages will in many cases not install due to missing dependencies. Also some convenience tools of Ubuntu are missing in Debian (instead of PPAs, one has to add the full deb-repository URL, there's no software center,...). In addition, Debian has the non-free repository, which contains for instance the GPU drivers for AMD and nVidia, disabled by default (it's not difficult to enable it, but it might be that after installation the GUI does not start and one has to use the command line for driver installation...).\n\nA: Fastest is going to be Gentoo with a custom kernel and only the applications you use optimized for your hardware. It takes a long time to learn to install, compile, and optimize gentoo, however, and you are not going to notice a huge difference if you use a binary distro such as Arch Linux, Fedora, Debian, Slackware, or Ubuntu.\nYou are going to get the most bang for your time by performing a minimal install of Arch, Fedora, Debian, Slackware, Ubuntu, etc and install only the packages you use + a light weight window manager such as Openbox.\nIf you want a preconfigured distro take a look at Slax, Slitaz, TinyCore, Crunchbang, Zenwalk, and puppy linux.\n\nA: Here is a list of versions and the recommended specs: \n Installation/SystemRequirements\nI would suggest a minimal install with the Lubuntu desktop for its lightweight GUI.\nAlso the Ubuntu Netbook Edition may be worth looking at as it is designed more for your system.\n\nA: Give Lubuntu a go. I have the same computer model as yours and Lubuntu works great. As an advice I'd recommend to increase the RAM to 2GB, you'll notice the difference of performance.\n", "Q: Why are my 32bit OpenGL libraries pointing to mesa instead of nvidia, and how do I fix it? I have installed Nvidia's drivers on my Ubuntu 13 system, but according to this command (ldconfig -p | grep GL):\n$ ldconfig -p | grep GL\n    libQtOpenGL.so.4 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtOpenGL.so.4\n    libGLU.so.1 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLU.so.1\n    libGLEWmx.so.1.8 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEWmx.so.1.8\n    libGLEW.so.1.8 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so.1.8\n    libGLESv2.so.2 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mesa-egl/libGLESv2.so.2\n    libGL.so.1 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/libGL.so.1\n    libGL.so.1 (libc6) => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1\n    libGL.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/libGL.so\n    libEGL.so.1 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mesa-egl/libEGL.so.1\n\nThe 32bit version of OpenGL is pointing to mesa's libraries instead of nvidia. This causes my Steam games to refuse to launch with the error:\n\nCould not find required OpenGL entry point 'glGetError'! Either your video card is unsupported, or your OpenGL driver needs to be updated.\n\nWhy is this the case? When the nvidia installer asked me if I wanted to install \"32bit compatability libraries\" (or something like that) I chose yes. How do I fix this?\n\nEdit:\nI just reinstalled the same Nvidia driver,  and that apparently removed the 32bit OpenGL driver completely:\n$ ldconfig -p | grep libGL.so\n    libGL.so.1 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/libGL.so.1\n    libGL.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/libGL.so\n\nNow Steam won't start:\n\nYou are missing the following 32-bit libraries, and Steam may not run:\n  libGL.so.1\n\nAgain, I chose YES when the installer asked me if I wanted to install 32bit libraries. Why are they not installed!?\n\nA: Option 1: Try running sudo ldconfig in a terminal. Reboot and try.\nOption 2: If this doesn't sort it, you will have to manually add the directory of the NVidia libs (/usr/lib32) to the ldconfig configuration file (/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf) and then re-run ldconfig (as root of course)\nEDIT: I would make a copy of libc.conf before changing it.\n\nA: When I reinstalled the Nvidia drivers, all mesa OpenGL drivers were removed from the library cache. My library cache looked like this:\n$ ldconfig -p | grep libGL.so\n    libGL.so.1 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/libGL.so.1\n    libGL.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/libGL.so\n\nNo 32bit drivers there! Luckily, after a quick search, I found Nvidia's 32bit drivers under /usr/lib32. I added that path to a file under /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ (any file will do, you can even make a new file) and ran sudo ldconfig. My cache now looks like this:\n$ ldconfig -p | grep libGL.so\n    libGL.so.1 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/libGL.so.1\n    libGL.so.1 (libc6) => /usr/lib32/libGL.so.1\n    libGL.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/libGL.so\n    libGL.so (libc6) => /usr/lib32/libGL.so\n\nAnd Steam works perfectly!\n\nA: Codemonkey Correct.All you have to do is add the 32bit nvidia's driver and remove the mesa driver.\ncd /etc/ld.so.conf.d/\n\nls\n\nfind a filename with the \"i386\"\nmine is \"i386-linux-gnu_GL.conf\"\nthen I write,\nsudo gedit i386-linux-gnu_GL.conf \n\nthen add 32 bit driver's path using gedit.\nmine is \"/usr/lib32/\".\nIf you cannot find your 32 bit driver location, Just search it.\nSave. Open terminal and type:\nsudo ldconfig\n\nMy Half-Life2  work perfectly after this. :D\n", "Q: How can I get root access after I installed Ubuntu on my PC? How can I get root access after I installed Ubuntu on my PC? The system keeps telling me that I have to be root for execution some of the commands.\n\nA: The standard approach is to prefix such commands with sudo.  By default the userid you created during the installation will be able to use sudo.   When you use sudo you will be prompted for the password of the userid you are running the command from (not the root password).  You can enable additional users by adding them to the admin group or adding them to /etc/sudoers.  On Ubuntu this can be done by adding the appropriate configuration lines to a file in the /etc/sudoers.d directory.  These files need to be owned by root, and should no be accessible to others. \nThe command visudo can be used to safely edit sudoers files.  By default it will use vi as the editor but it will use another editor if the EDITOR environment variable has been set to the desired command and exported.\n\nA: Add sudo in front of the commands that are asking to be run a root.\nsudo basically tells Ubuntu to run the command as the root user\nYou will be asked for your password\nAn alternative is running the sudo -i command and this will run all commands entered as root for as long as that terminal session remains open or exit is typed\nEDIT: Be carefully with the sudo command as you can do seriously damage to Ubuntu, as I have found out many times myself. \n", "Q: Missing & Failed Folder At/and After Installation I am new to Linux, and I've trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (dual boot with Windows XP).

But when I pressed the install button, the installer warned me :\n\nFailed to create the 150 GB shared partition.\n\nSo I turned back to the partition section and changed the shared partition to 50GB FAT32 (/mnt/shared). I pressed the install button and I was successful. But, when I boot Ubuntu, I could not find this 50GB folder.\nQUESTIONS:\n1. What is wrong with the 150GB size? Is my hard disk failing?\n2. Why is the 50GB shared folder not showing?\nThank for the help.\n\nA: The maximum size of a FAT32 volume was once 32 Gigs, but can be higher depending on the formatting tool. 150GB is probably beyond the limits. You may wish to consider NTFS for your shared partition, since Ubuntu can reliable read and write NTFS in the last several releases. \nTo help locate your shared partition, please post the output of fdisk -l /dev/sda\n", "Q: Should I install Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Server? Sorry if this is a simple question, but - eeks - I'm really a Windows person(!).  I'm getting a PowerEdge Server to do really just ONE thing: I need to run interactive sessions of MATLAB (parallel computing with high CPU/RAM use).

As an aside, I would have just gotten a workstation, but I got a good deal on the server with better specs - Dual E5-2690s :)\nI know basically nothing about this, so any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks so much!\n\nA: Honestly, there's really no reason to use the Desktop version of Ubuntu on a server. Especially if it's going to be using a high amount of CPU/RAM/etc. I would install Ubuntu Server and go from there. If you really need a GUI to work with, then you can install a lightweight desktop environment like XFCE or LXDE. Gnome, KDE, or Unity are the heavyweights, so try to stay away from those in this particular instance.

I'm considering throwing ubuntu onto my xbox 360, but wanted to know if it'd be able to handle a single game, League of Legends.   \nI'm guessing no, not because the hardware isn't capable, but because there are no drivers good enough for the graphics needed.  Curious though as to if it's possible as I currently am unable to play it on this pc (too outdated).\n\nA: Xbox 360 is a tri-core and has 512MB of GDDR3 clocked at 700MHz. It is shared between the CPU and GPU via unified memory architecture It doesn't have to run a desktop environment or even an X server or many hardware drivers. \nThe GPU its self is called a Xenos. The GPU package contains two separate silicon dies, each on a 90 nm chip with a clock speed of 500 MHz; the GPU proper and a 10 MB eDRAM daughter-die. Thanks to the daughter die, the Xenos can do 4x FSAA, z-buffering, and alpha blending with no appreciable performance penalty on the GPU. \nThis is how it is able to play games the way it does. \nSo if you load the xbox up with Ubuntu, an X Server and a DE, there isn't going to be enough of that 512MB to run a game on a system that isn't using drivers designed for the hardware. \nSo I am afraid you have guessed right, it is a no go on the Xbox. You will have to invest on some upgrade for your machine. And even if you do, you will still have to run the games via wine, which may cause problems within its self. \n\nA: You basically guessed right: it won't work. League of Legends doesn't even have a native Linux client. So, you'd basically be trying to emulate something on a platform that's not even supported by the hardware to begin with.\nThe only \"real\" hack is Free60 but it looks dormant. I'd just drop the $400 on a laptop that can play it. It really doesn't take much.\n", "Q: How do I set up QT Creator to use launchpad?

That is, on booting up the Linux System, the Windows should be launched with no intervention from the user. The user should feel, that he is using Windows, but underneath the Linux would be running. He should be able to use the Windows applications, Network, Networked devices and the Internet within the VM itself. I have to install and demonstrate such a machine and also remove all notifications and options to the user which appears in the Linux OS including disabling access to the Linux system when Windows is running (so as to not confuse the user). Also steps reqd for disabling the use of keys like Ctrl+Alt+ Del which may allow to do this. I have a virtualbox installed on an ubuntu 12 04 OS. What are the steps? \n\nA: I'll give you a few hints. I assume that you are using VBox as your virtual machine. I also assume that you have created your Windows virtual machine somewhere.\nFirst make sure that you are able to start a vbox machine with a script. The key here is the VBoxManage command that you can use to start windows using a command line. If the name of the virtual machine I want to start is, for example, \"Windows\", here is what I do to start it from the command line:\nVBoxManage startvm Windows\n\nNext, you need to create a script with this command line. Something like\n#!/bin/bash\n/usr/bin/VBoxManage startvm Windows\n\nSave it somewhere and make it executable (chmod a+x /your/script/name). Try to run it: did it start Windows?\nSecond step. You need to create a session in your login manager, which will use your script as the desktop to run. Creating a session is easy -- it is just a text file sitting in /usr/share/xsessions directory that holds the parameters of your session; for example, look at this answer. You will have to name your session somehow (say, \"windows\"). In the Exec line you need to enter your script with the full path. That way, when this session is selected, your script will be run as the session manager.\nYour session file could look like that:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Windows shell\nComment=This session starts the Windows virtual machine\nExec=/your/script/name\nTryExec=\nIcon=\nType=Application\n\nNow is the time to test whether your session works. You still have your lightdm login manager, you still have the other sessions in case something goes wrong. Log out, and login selecting \"windows\". Did it work? What happens when you quit windows? Everything oK? Proceed to next step.\nFinally, you must ensure that the session is automatically selected. See here for details. For this, you will modify /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf. You need to tell lightdm (1) which user should auto-login (autologin-user=), (2) that the auto-login should start immediately (autologin-user-timeout=0) and (3) that the session to run is the same session you have created in the previous step.\nHope this is enough to help you.\n", "Q: qemu -cdrom ubuntu.iso -boot d -m 1024 -curses How do I disable frame buffers in Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy kernel,\nI tried all kinds of kernel parameters but none work?\nDEFAULT ramdisk\nLABEL ramdisk\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz\n  append boot=casper toram initrd=/casper/initrd.img -- vesafb.nonsense=1\nLABEL isotest\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz\n  append boot=casper integrity-check initrd=/casper/initrd.img -- vesafb.nonsense=1\nLABEL memtest\n  kernel /install/memtest\n  append -\nDISPLAY isolinux.txt\nTIMEOUT 300\nPROMPT 1\n\n\nA: this works\nappend boot=casper toram initrd=/casper/initrd.img nomodeset\n\n", "Q: wifi disabled by hardware switch , ubuntu 13.04, lenovo g580 my problem is that I installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my Lenovo G580 laptop. now Wifi and Bluetooth are not working, it is showing \"wifi is disabled by hardware switch\".\nI tried using dedicated key fn+f5, but didn't work and tried rfkill also. \nplease help me\n\nA: On my G570 laptop, their is a small tiny black switch which acts as the hardware switch.

It (s) searches the line for a matching regexp regular expression (-r). If a portion of the line is matched, the replacement will be used to replace the matching portion. The -n switch and p command are only required to omit lines that are not matching the regexp.\n\n*sed locates the string \"_login:\" in a line. At that position:\n\n\n*\n\n*The opening bracket marks the start of a sub-expression. (Consider it a region of the line.)\n\n*The [^ @]+ matches one more character that is neither a space nor @. It will expand until a space character is found.\n\n*The closing bracket marks the end of the sub-expression just before this character. The matched region is stored in a variable called \\1.\n\n\n*If you take a look at the regexp part it basically follows the ^.*something.*$ pattern. The ^.* matches any characters at the beginning of the line until the expression something. Similarly the .*$ matches any characters at the end of line after the expression something. Matching the whole line with the regexp is important, because the whole matched portion is replaced.\n\n*The replacement part only contains the \\1 variable, thus the matched login name will be substituted.\n\n", "Q: minidlna and samsung tv file format doesn't support I have PC with XUbuntu 12.04 and Samsung 27A950, so I want to use my PC like dlna server.\nBut I can run file of any format on my TV, get error: \"File format doesn't support\".

You may also have to make sure that this port is accessible for your TV from your router. In case the port is wrong your TV may not see miniDLNA at all.\nport=9500\n\nMedia directories\nPut here the directories to add to miniDLNA's media library.

This seems to be a limitation of the TV device, as you find it reported frequently.\nSo miniDLNA is not really an option if you want to serve most videos (moreover, it sometimes manages to almost bring the entire system down by completely filling up the partition /var/log is located on: opening too many http connections and then complaining about it in its logs, it reached almost 50 GB log file size on my machine, so I had to stop it).\n\nYou might want to take a look at a different DLNA server, like e.g. Serviio, which uses FFMpeg to transcode media files to a format understood by the device. I just tried to set this up on my machine yesterday: unfortunately, Canonical decided to drop FFMpeg from the repositories (you can still do an apt-get install ffmpeg successfully, but that delivers a different software including some \"ffmpeg compatibility\" stuff, which seems incompatible with Serviio. On their site, however, they explain how to build FFMPeg from the sources − if that's an option for you. Looks like too much pain for the normal user to me, though.\nEdit: Serviio seems to work fine with my UE55ES out-of-the-box, even with the Generic profile. I followed this German HowTo to install it. As for FFMPeg, there are static binaries available for download. Simpy downloading the tarball, and extracting the two files to /usr/local/bin did it for me.\nOther possible alternatives to take a look at (none of them I tested yet):\n\n\n*\n\n*Rygel (can at least be installed via PPA, transcoding supported). According to a German Howto, it also seems to be available in the regular repos, so you should be able to simply apt-get install rygel (plus optionally rygel-preferences for a management frontend and rygel-mediathek as well as rygel-tracker for some more plugins). But as the support for Samsung TVs seems to have been added only recently, the version in Precise's repository does not work for you − the \"official PPA\" might to be favored.\n\n*Mediatomb: As Samsung TVs (at least those of 2012) are not complying with RFC2396, this requires a manual installation as well to be used with them. May sound a big deal at first, but as described at gnulnx.net it seems to be quite straight-forward. (A simpler method is described here, if you want to test it: it just involves editing a text file)\n\n*PS3MediaServer (aka PMS) you already mentioned to be working fine, so I probably will have to take a closer look at it, too ;)\n\n\nOther solutions like e.g. XBMC seem to heavy-weighted to me for the purpose. An interesting overview for other alternatives can be found e.g. at MakeUseOf.\nTo check whether your uPnP server works in general, you can e.g. use eezUPnP on your Ubuntu workstation.\n\nA: Know this an old post, but someone might search it and help them with MiniDLNA\nI run Ubuntu 1204lts.\nHad minidlna working sweet.\nThen installed owncloud and it broke my minidlna install - TV said file not supported - XBMC similar errors.

All you need to do is to save a text file and set the permissions to \"executable\". It might look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Hello world\"\n\nOr, it might be a wrapper around a jar file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\njava -jar YourJarFile.jar\n\nThere are ways to encode a binary file into a shell script such that when the shell script is run, it will create the binary file -- a kind of self-extracting archive. But it is not possible to \"convert jar to sh\". Also, it is kind of useless. \nYou can just carry your jar file around.

A device in a powered off state is really off, you see. Similarly - your can't receive phone calls on your mobile phone without it having turned on. Some software can't do magic here.\nHowever, I know of two techniques exist to manage the power without the machine being turned on, although it needs the wall socket power to be connected of course.\n\n\n*\n\n*Wake on LAN. It's a feature of your network card - it will listen to \"magic packets\" to arrive on the interface to trigger a \"power on\" event on the PCI bus. It needs some standby power and another device in the same local network to be able to send such magic packets. So, basically, you'll have to\n\n\n*\n\n*configure your BIOS to listed to WoL events.\n\n*have a network card that supports this.\n\n*configure your network card to do so (see manpage of ethtool).\n\n*have some device connected to the internet fire up the PC by sending the magic packet on the local network.\n\n\nMajor limitation: no available directly over the internet.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wake-on-lan under Ubuntu 12.04\n\n*How can I enable wake-on-lan permanently?\n\n*Power Management - Sleep / Wake up Server when accessed\n\n\n*Out of Band management module. Some motherboards, mostly server and business-line desktop machines feature the Intel vPro with AMT. In servers you'll notice most have a dedicated card for this - HP iLO, Dell iDRAC, etc. With such a module you'll be able to control power (and usually more). See the manual of your desktop if you have it and how that works.\nMajor limitation: hardware requirements.\nAfter the machine has been powered on with one of the techniques above, you'll have to make sure your remote desktop server (e.g. VNC server, NX server, etc.) is started and the network is automatically connected properly, so you can connect to it.\n", "Q: Can't connect to specific WiFi with 13.04 Recently I have upgraded my OS from 12.10 to 13.04, its working just fine.\nI was not facing this problem till today but I am not able to connect to a particular WiFi from the morning.

Will all XP files be deleted?

Wubi is designed to try Ubuntu out without fiddling with your hard drive partition, and yet do have it permanently installed. It fills the gap between a \"real\" install and the non-persistent Live disc image.\nWith Wubi you use an installer inside Windows (.exe file), so there's no way to use the regular partitioner, I believe. Instead, it will be installed in a file (root.disk if I'm correct) on the NTFS drive of your Windows OS.\nSo, basically, only some files will be added and the Windows bootloader will be configured to have an entry to boot into Ubuntu, installed in the root.disk file.\n", "Q: I deleted all files and folders (including hidden) from /home/username/ now in big trouble I am logged into a remote ubuntu server, and I accidentally erased the entire /home/username/ directory for the current user.  The only thing left is a hidden directory called .gvfs.  I don't need anything of the Documents/Music/etc.\nNow it is not letting me cd into the /var/www/ directory, which has permissions 666 and it is owned by the current user.  \nI am afraid to disconnect from my ssh session because I don't know if I will be able to get back on.  Have I permanently created a problem?  Is there a way I can replace the most important files to the /home/username/ directory?\nThanks!\n** EDIT **\nThanks everyone for the help.  I figured the problem with cd into the /var/www/ was actually my permissions in the /var/www/ directory. It was set to 666, changed it to 755 and everything was good again. It doesn't look like anything systematic was ruined by deleting the contents of the user folder.\n\nA: The system should continue to be completely usable in itself with files in a user's home directory all deleted. You certainly shouldn't have any problem cd'ing to /var/www.\nBut directories need to have execute permission for users to be able to traverse to them. You said /var/www was 666, which doesn't include any execute bits, so it sounds like you have a separate problem. Try: sudo chmod 755 /var/www to set /var/www back to reasonable permissions.\nYou may also find it useful to copy the contents of /etc/skel to the home directory where you have deleted everything. If you do, make sure the files you copy end up having the owner and group of the user. This is done when you create a new user and provides a set of sane defaults for new users to start with.\nYou also said you were ssh'd in as this user. To make sure you can do so again, you'll need to restore the ~/.ssh directory with 700 permissions, and make sure that ~/.ssh/authorized_keys contains your public key. You can test this with a different ssh session before you log out of your original one.\n\nA: If you log into ssh with a password, you need not worry about your ssh session. However, if you login without a password, ie with an ssh key, then the most important file to restore now is the one allowing your ssh access. For this, you need to find the contents of the file\n~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\non your LOCAL computer, and put it in the file\n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\non your REMOTE computer.\nUse a second, simultaneous ssh session in another terminal window to see whether you can still login. \n\nA: try pressing Ctrl + Alt + T to launch Terminal\nNext, type in \nnautilus\n\nto run the file manager and try to undelete \nIf this doesn't work, you could try manually adding the required folders either in nautilus if it will let you, or in Terminal using the mkdir command, create a Home folder then folder which is your username so that you can get to ~ or /home/username then you'll need to create:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop\n\n*Documents\n\n*Downloads\n\n*Music\n\n*Pictures\n\n*Public\n\n*Videos\n\n\nHopefully this will get you back and running \nI HAVE NOT TRIED THIS AND IT MAY NOT WORK\n\nA: You could try out http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/ to see if you're able to recover the directory and files. If possible, make sure nothing more is written to the disk before you have tried to get the old files back.\n", "Q: Installed ubuntu on wrong hard drive, how do I remove?

The section name appears on a line by itself, in square brackets ([ and ]). All keys after the section declaration are associated with that section.

Sections may not be nested.\n\nRegarding Nova itself you can have several other sections (and it also explains DEFAULT):\n\nSections\nConfiguration options are grouped by section. The Compute config file supports the following sections.\n[DEFAULT]\nAlmost all of the configuration options are organized into this section.

See the Cells section of the OpenStack Compute Admin Manual for more details.\n[baremetal]\nThis section is used for options that relate to the baremetal hypervisor driver.\n[conductor]\nThe conductor section is used for options for configuring the nova-conductor service.\n[trusted_computing]\nThe trusted_computing section is used for options that relate to the trusted computing pools functionality. Options in this section describe how to connect to a remote attestation service.\n\n\nRegarding the coloring: it is more than likely that the editor you use is aware of INI file configuration and understands \"sections\" and \"keys/properties\".\n", "Q: Custom keyboard shortcut for workspace switcher I would like to change the keyboard shortcut for the workspace switcher in Unitity.

In a 32-bit only processor the 64-bit installer not even starts.\nIn lscpu output CPU op-mode(s):32-bit, 64-bit means your CPU is both 32-bit and 64-bit capable.

Below is a link to my new working file.\nhttp://pastebin.com/Xm8H7XeQ\n", "Q: Gparted and reallocation I had a triple boot configuration with Windows 7, Mint 13, and Ubuntu 13.04.  I deleted the Mint OS. Using Gparted I shrunk the old Mint (sda5) and now have unallocated space (see below screenshot).\nI would like to optimize the Ubuntu OS by reallocating that space to the Ubuntu section. \nWhat is the best way to do this?  Increasing the Ubuntu size or the swap size?\n\n\nA: You have a few options, but I would not recommend several of them for a new user.\nFirst, the 68 GB unallocated space is not part of sda5 anymore. sda5 is now just under 1 GB. You might be able to delete sda5, thereby increasing the size of the unallocated space by 993 MB. But the question is why sda5 is the way it is. \nIf you simply chose to make it that size or were unsure if you could delete it and chose to just make it small, you can probably go ahead and delete it. But...if when you shrank the partition, gparted would not let you make it any smaller, trust gparted and leave it alone.\nKeep in mind that you will need to perform any actions from live media, since you will not be able to work on a logical partition without unmounting the logical partitions with a higher number.\nOption 1) Move sda6 to the left and then resize it to to fill the space.\nThis is not recommended for a beginner. Moving a partition can cause data loss, can take an extremely long time, and will almost certainly leave the computer unbootable into either OS until you reinstall grub.\nOption 2) Make an new ext4 partition in the unallocated space, move the contents of sda6 into it, and then delete sda6 and increase the size of the new partion.\nThis is also not recommended for a beginner, but is arguably better than Option (1). For instructions, see Move the whole installed files to another partition. If you are interested, be sure you understand the steps before doing anything. Note that it will also render the computer unbootable until you reinstall grub.\nOption 3) Use the live media to do a clean install into the unallocated space.\nFor a beginner, this is the easiest and safest thing to do. You can make a new ext4 partition either during the install or before. \nI would recommend backing up all of your data to external media. Then using Try Ubuntu, then use gparted to create an ext4 logical partition in the unallocated space. Give it an easily recognizable label, like NewInstall. \nAfter that, run the installer, choosing the Something else option so you can specify the partition you want.\nThen move your data to the new install and reinstall your packages and programs. This step might be time consuming, but IMO it is much simpler for a beginner than trying the other options.\nOnce you are satisfied that the new install is correct and that your data are safe, delete what is currently sda6 (be careful since the numbering may change) and resize your new partition into that space.\nMenus for deleting, creating, or resizing partitions are found in gparted by right clicking the partition or using the Partition menu.\nOption 4) Deleting the swap partition, expand sda6 into that space, and create a swap partition in the unallocated space.\nThis is generally safe, but is problematic for a couple of reasons.\na) You have filled 50 out of 52 GB already. I would guess that either you have a lot of data or have installed a lot of packages. In either case, I doubt the extra 7 GB will be enough and you will find yourself in the same position before too long.\nb) Deleting the current swap space will require changes to your fstab file. Again, this is not recommended for a beginner.\n\nA: Increase your ubuntu partition size, 7GiB should be more than enough for any sort of daily task.\n", "Q: Unable to move files and folders I use Ubuntu 12.04 and all my drives are of the ext4 file system. I tried to cut and paste a folder from the location /home/username/Documents to a logical drive which is of the ext4 file system but I couldn't. There was no option for paste at all. I tried ctrl+v but that also didn't work. Why is that and what do I need to do to move the folder?\n\nA: most probably user rights problem.\ntry to start nautilus/filemanager with sudo from terminal and check if you are able to do it as a root. If yes, it is enough to set up correct user rights on destination drive.\n\nA: I solved the issue by formatting my partitions to NTFS file system which were of ext4 file system previously. \n", "Q: How to install vnc server so I can have complete control on my Ubuntu Server? I installed ubuntu server 12.04. I installed gnome desktop on that (GUI essential for my purpose). Now I want to control the server remotely. I tried following things and not very successful :\n1)Installed xrdp , but it is very laggy. Not useful for me.\n2)Installed nomachine, it is better than xrdp but not good enough for my purpose.\n3)Installed VNC server and used tigerVNC to connect it. It gave the best result. I want to continue to use it. But I am facing following problems :\n\n\n*\n\n*I cant login as root through VNC.

If there is any other solution apart from using tiger vnc , I am open to it.\n\nA: Try either one of the following;\n\n\n*\n\n*install xrdp package and connect through RDP client e.g Remote Desktop client if using Windows or another client like Remmina client.\n\n*Install Teamviewer (my prefferred) and configure it to start automattically and set an unattended access password for it. Then connect to it also with another TeamViewer installed on the other machine (Team viewer has a very good graphics and performance especially in LAN connections as it uses a direct connection rather than connecting through Team Viewer servers \"if you don't have Internet connection, just connect using machine IP instead of TeamViewer ID and it will use LAN connection automatically\")\n", "Q: Why doesn't System Settings remember my proxy settings?

If that variable is set, then programs will use it as the settings..\nFor example, if one exports the variable:\n   export http_proxy='http://username:password@proxy.address.com:8080'\n\nand runs any programm requiring web, it should go through the proxy.\nThis does not answer your question though exactly (although if you place this line in your .bashrc file in your home, this might be a workaround for your problem).\nI suppose you might need to extract the address/port from the pac file youself.. Access it from the browser and use the \"save as\" option..\n", "Q: Differences between standard keyboard layout in windows and linux? I'm want to switch from using mostly osx to using mostly linux (for everything unix) and windows (unfortunately, because of work, I need to be effective using excel/outlook and various other apps in the \"native\" enviroment, wine won't do) in vms. Now, I know there are differences in the keyboard layout of osx and linux (@ key, ' key etc. etc.), but does ubuntu and windows have the same keyboard layout? (My goal is to be able to use ubuntu 90% of the time and seamlessly switch into windows when I have to.) If there are any differences, what are they? And is it possible to make linux use the same keyboard layout as windows?\n\nA: Go \"system settings -> Keyboard Layout\" then click the \"+\" button. I am guessing the difference your experiencing is the difference between US and UK keyboard if you are using English, so choose the one that isn't currently active (look at the layout preview if you want to check) and then you can delete your original layout from the list with the \"-\" button.\n", "Q: Back to Factory settings I need to return my computer to the company after our mass lay off. I want to remove everything. I care nothing about any files. Just need it ALL removed. Please advise me, as I am obviously a novice. Thank you in advance!!\n\nA: First off, definitely make sure you don't need anything on there. Once you've done that use Darik's Boot And Nuke (DBAN) if you want everything removed.\n\nDBAN is a self-contained boot disk that automatically deletes the\n  contents of any hard disk that it can detect. This method can help\n  prevent identity theft before recycling a computer. It is also a\n  solution commonly used to remove viruses and spyware from Microsoft\n  Windows installations. DBAN prevents all known techniques of hard disk\n  forensic analysis. It does not provide users with a proof of erasure,\n  such as an audit-ready erasure report.\n\nSource: http://www.dban.org/\n\nA: Deleting files is as easy as using the Del key on the file navigator or using the rm command.\nI will assume that all your files are in your home (something like /home/myName/), and therefore all you need to do is: \n$ rm -rf *\n\nIf you want to delete things out of your home directory everything is exactly the same but you have to use sudo (and be an authorised sudoer on your machine, of course!). \nNow, if you want to make absolutely sure that nobody, even the CIA and their forensic experts, will ever see those files again this may not be enough. \n\nWith adequate tools and a lot of time files can be recovered from a hard disk even after they are deleted. If you want to make them disappear forever beyond recovery you need to use shred on the file that identifies your home partition. Assuming it is /dev/sda1 (you can see with command 'mount'), you need to write: \n$ sudo shred -f -z -n 10 /dev/sda1\n\nAlternatively, if you are not an authorised sudoer, you can shred each and every file in your account, one by one: \n$ find . -exec shred -f -u -n 10 \\{\\} \\;\n\nThe -u option deletes the file after shredding it. It should not be used with /dev/sda1. \n(more info on man rm and man shred)\n", "Q: ASUS Xonar DG not working Ubuntu I've checked the \"Questions that may already have your answer\" to no avail.\nBasically, there is no sound at all, the snd_oxygen drivers are all being loaded.

My drives are formated from my mac as mac journald and the permissions are to let everyone read and write to them.\nFrom Linux the permissions are owner user#99\nHow can I write to these devices?\n\nA: You need to turn off journaling if you want to be able to read/write to it from Ubuntu. Ubuntu only has support for writing to non-journaled HFS+ volumes.  Linux can read HFS+ volumes. It can also write to HFS+ volumes, but only if they're formatted without journaling.\nOn your Mac, you can do so from disk utility, or open terminal, and do:\ndiskutil disableJournal /Volumes/Macintosh HD\n\nThen you can mount the partition on Ubuntu\nsudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/sdax /media/mac\n\nComplements of Z.Hossain\n", "Q: My computer will not reboot after fresh install of ubuntu 12.04LTS I bought a new computer yesterday and it came with Windows 8.

Or onto one of the partitions in the other disk first and then uninstall Windows?  What will happen to the partitions on the second disk, which I don't particularly see a need for?\nThanks in advance for any advice. \n\nA: If you are sure that you won't use Windows then install Ubuntu on the 40Gig from DVD/USB. You can then use the 2nd drive to store your personal data - this will make it easier to upgrade. You can remove the partitions on it after you installed Ubuntu on the 40Gig by opening Disks from the dash.\nIf you want to keep Windows for just in case then just install Ubuntu on the 80Gig from a DVD/USB.

I am seeking a place where to find stories of individuals and businesses that may have switched from a Windows OS to Ubuntu and were/are happy with their switch and why?\n\nA: I switched from using windows XP almost exclusively, to using Ubuntu exclusively about a year ago.  I made the switch because my installation of XP broke.  A re-install was not possible because I lost the product key.  \nThe switch to Ubuntu was pretty brutal.  I needed my computer for college work etc. and it really took me a while to get used to.  Naturally I was looking for a windows like UI so I decided to try Kubuntu after a while.  This I did not like for some reason.  (KDE is a bit cumbersome I think). \nI decided to try openSUSE because of their commitment to KDE, but I couldn't get used to YaST.  I tried some others (Debian and Arch Linux), but due to my rather limitted knowledge of the Linux OS I didn't get very far.  Eventually, I ended up using good ol' ubuntu again.  Since I hadn't used Ubuntu in the GNOME 2 era, Unity did not bother me so much.\nWhen 12.10 came out I upgraded (which broke my install).  Rather than re-install ubuntu I figured I should try some other linux flavours.  Eventually I stuck with Arch Linux.  I stuck with it because I loved the minimalistic system I was able to build, as well as the pacman package manager.  \nOn my laptop I still use Ubuntu because it requires much less maintainance than arch, and handles WI-FI connectivity out of the box.\nAt work I also use Ubuntu (I had no choice really), but I use the xfce desktop environment because it runs smoother on the hardware.\nI have also recently re-installed windows (windows seven this time) for compatibility reasons, and because I like gaming.\nMy conclusion is that, unless you are intending to game or require specific software, Linux (which distro does not matter so much) is a superior OS, especially for software development.\nAs for Ubuntu itself, it is certainly not my favourite distro, (I prefer more lightweight alternatives) but with the xfce or lxde desktop environment it is very usable.  By far my favourite though is Arch Linux.\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux\n", "Q: Error installing Ubuntu touch on Galaxy Nexus I am getting an error when trying to install Ubuntu touch on my Galaxy Nexus.

After installing  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS , would i be able to update my system to 13.04 without losing my data? And how i will do it? Can Anyone Tell me?\n\nA: Yes you can, but first you will have to upgrade to 12.10\nRecently I have upgraded my OS from 12.04 to 12.10 & then after 12.10 to 13.04.\nBut it's always recommended to keep backup of your data before going for any version upgrade, so better keep it.\n\nA: In the update manager there will be an option to upgrade to the next verion of Ubuntu.  You might have to go via 12.10 if you are unlucky.\nHowever, only two update paths are supported:\n\n\n*\n\n*to the immediate next version\n\n*from one LTS to the next\n\n\nTherefore, the only direct updates available from 12.04 LTS are 12.10 and 14.04 LTS. You will need to upgrade to 12.10 first and from there to 13.04.\nI generally found though that upgrading would introduce subtle but irritating bugs into the system.  So I would recommend just backing up your home folder (an any others containing data you want to keep), making a note of programs/applications you have installed, and performing a clean install.\nIt is not that much more effort (takes 20-40 mins) and is likely to provide a smoother running system.\nGood Luck!\nAlso see: Can I skip over releases when upgrading?\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on a separate hard-drive in dualboot I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 on a hard-drive that is separate from the one Windows 7 is on. I have two drives in my computer and the second is unused and blank. \nHowever, when I go to install Ubuntu and select the Something Else option, I get kind of paranoid. Last time I did this, it wiped my Windows drive and still installed in the second drive. I do now want a repeat of that. \nIf someone could give me instructions on dual booting Ubuntu with Windows 7 using two hard-drives that would be great.\n\nA: You have to select the correct hard drive. Windows is almost certainly on sda and you will want to install on sdb. Install grub into the first hard drive.\nIf you do not know which drive has windows, use gparted.\n\nA: You can use BIOS to select other HDD as primary, then install Ubuntu on it. Then from BIOS you can easily switch in between HDDs and boot into Windows or linux\n", "Q: Which Google Chrome version should I install for my system? The computer is a Toshiba Satellite system, and it was left here by an old roommate who destroyed the Windows 7 operating system. He repaired it by installing Ubuntu on it. We are in desperate need of another computer, but for now I'm figuring out how to install Chrome on this installation.\nFurther system information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS\n\n*Memory: 2.7 GB\n\n*Processor: AMD Turion(tm)II P540 Dual Core Processor\n\n*Graphics: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 0x300)\n\n*OS type: 32-bit\n\n*Disk: 154.6 GB.\n\n\nwhen trying to install Google Chrome I was asked what download package to choose:\n\n\n*\n\n*32 bit deb (for Debian/Ubuntu\n\n*64 bit deb (for Debian/Ubuntu)\n\n*32 bit rpm (for Fedora/openSUSE)\n\n*64 bit rpm (for Fedora/openSUSE)\n\n\nSo Which one do I choose? I know that I have a 64 bit computer, and Ubuntu says that my OS type is a 32 bit. \nAlso, is there any way to upgrade to where it recognizes that it is a 64 bit system?\n\nA: For your current OS you can go for the 32 bit version without a problem. Just choose the proper option from the choices and after downloading the .deb package, run it by opening (maybe double click is needed), after which the Software Center Will appear allowing you to install the latest Google Chrome.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Although your computer is capable of running a 64 bit OS it seems someone installed a 32 bit OS. This will not cause any problems, you just might not get optimal performance. So it looks like you would want to install \"32 bit Deb\".\nHowever, if you look in the Software Store you can download Chromium browser. It is almost identical to Chrome and the install process is simpler. Here's the direct link to Chromium in Software Centre: chromium-browser \n", "Q: How do I change Firefox's `about:config` from a shell script? On of the first things I do when first using a fresh Firefox profile, is to set browser.urlbar.trimURLs to false (which really should be changeable though ‘Preferences’ or should have remained default), and to change the search and homepage defaults to DuckDuckGo. Currently I manually go to about:config, click through the angry warning message, and search for the keys (which unlike in DConf Editor, aren't even organised).\nSo I would like to know how to read and write these keys from the command-line so that I can add these tweaks to my customisations script.\n\nA: Here is a possible shell script. You have to cd to your profile directory before using it (where the user.js is). Say the script is called ff_set you could call it like:\nff_set browser.search.defaulturl '\"https://duckduckgo.com/\"'\n\nHere is the code: \n#!/bin/bash\n\nsed -i 's/user_pref(\"'$1'\",.*);/user_pref(\"'$1'\",'$2');/' user.js\ngrep -q $1 user.js || echo \"user_pref(\\\"$1\\\",$2);\" >> user.js\n\n\nA: [This doesn't provide what you've asked for but is a different way to achieve the same result.]\nFirst, about the warning... You can make sure you never see it again (on a per profile basis) as shown below:  \n\nNow, as regards the preferences you desire. In general, you can create a simple text file called user.js. This file has to be placed in the relevant profile folder such as /home/username/.mozilla/firefox/random.default (where random is something unique to each user).  \nThe structure and syntax of user.js is described in User.js file for example.\nSo in your case, you would have a line such as:\nuser_pref(\"set browser.urlbar.trimURLs\",\"false\");  \n\nor, to use your other example (but see further down):  \nuser_pref(\"browser.search.defaulturl\",\"https://duckduckgo.com/\");\n\nHowever, I suggest that you first ensure that the preferences you set are valid for the browser version you're using. I say this because I don't see browser.search.defaulturl at all in my about:config. I'm using Firefox 22 beta. Instead, I see:  \nbrowser.search.defaultenginename;Google\n\n\nSo, taking the example of using Bing instead of Google, the other line in your user.js if you're using Firefox 22, would be:\nuser_pref(\"browser.search.defaultenginename\",\"Bing\");\nAs the image indicates, you can search for additional engines.\nSo, in short, you can put your preferences in user.js and you can remove the nag screen by unticking in the first image.\nAlso, as indicated in the resource I linked to, you must restart the browser for the code in user.js to take effect.\n", "Q: Gnome source code of fade out effect for inactivity Where I can find the source code for fade out animation when the computer is inactive for x minutes?\nI guess that it somewhere in /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui but I want to find the line.\n\nNote - this question is NOT a duplicate of this:\n\n*\n\n*Brightness settings from terminal\nI want to modify the Gnome code. I want to localize where the fadeOut effect is present\n\nA: I don't think you're looking in the right way. The respective effect of fade out is realised by gnome-screensaver. Now, you can check (with which gnome-screensaver in terminal) that you have installed on your system gnome-screensaver, but the problem is that this is the compiled version, so no sources on your system in this sense.\nBut, don't worry, you can download gnome-screensaver source package from Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+source/gnome-screensaver. The source code of fade out effect can be found in gs-fade.c and gs-fade.h files from src directory:\n\n", "Q: New Install and Gaming Issues I'm totally new to linux, but I've basically had enough with using windows. A recent HDD failure has prompted me to take this as a good time to switch (my new setup will be a 250GB SSD and 1TB HDD for media).\nMost of my tasks involve simply using browsers, checking emails, compiling LaTeX and so on. However, I do still occasionally play games on my PC (on steam) and this seems to be the only negative of switching to ubuntu.\nSo, my question is basically one of the best solution for installing ubuntu but still being able to play steam games (I am aware that they now support some games).\nFrom what I gather, I have these options:\n1) Just install ubuntu and use a program like wine to run games.\n2) Partition my drive so that I have one for windows for when I want to play games and another for ubuntu, for everything else.\nThe only advantage of 1) is that I'll have more disk space without having to install windows (and potentially create too large of a partition for it. I assume that the games should be installed onto the same partition as the OS?). On the other hand, it feels natural to me that running games through a program like wine isn't going to be all that great - can it handle newer games well (civ V, CSGO?); does one see a general drop of frame rate?\nOption 2) seems like the best option for me, but then I need to decide on how to partition the drive and risk losing unnecessary space.\nI would be very grateful to hear opinions on the best solution. I am totally new to ubuntu and this forum, so apologies if the question isn't appropriate, is poorly phrased, or is too long!\n\nA: From personal experience I can say that running games (especially newer ones) through wine, although possible, can be a very frustrating process.  Even if you eventually get them to run, there will be some reduction in performance.\nThere are some comercial tools (crossover comes to mind) for running windows applications on linux, but I have never tried them.\nI found that installing a windows partition purely for gaming was a much simpler solution. I use an old 160GB HDD for my windows partition and that seems to do the trick nicely.  If you are worried about running out of HHD space then buy a small(ish) second hand HDD.  \nAlso if you only keep games on your windows partition, and not important files, then it is not too critical if the installation breaks and you have to re-install.\nEDIT:\nIn terms of partitioning layout.  I have a separate 160GB HDD for windows, and a 250GB HDD for linux.  I have separate root, var, swap and home partitions, sized at 20, 10, 4.5 and the rest GB each.\nI recommend reading this wiki entry: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning\nAlthough it is not specific to Ubuntu, the principals still apply. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 works fine from live USB but can't boot after install It just gets stuck on the black screen while loading its services.\nIt boots if I go into recovery mode then I select resume normal boot but it's very slow and the laptop fan goes crazy.\nIt works perfectly fine and fast from USB. \nAny help?\nEdit.\nI have an Nvidia GEFORCE GT555M and the notebook model is Asus N55S\nEdit 2.\nDoes Ubuntu uses the Nvidia driver when I boot from USB or the open source drivers?\nIf it uses the open source drivers, I would like to keep using those. everything works great from usb, it fails to boot after install and if I resume normal boot from recovery mode, it works but it is very slow and the fan goes nuts.\nAlso I see no Nvidia driver when I go into additional drivers tab, maybe that helps.\n\nA: Open terminal and try \n\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current \n\nTry this in graphics safe mode from recovery menu if your desktop doesn't load\nthen reboot\n\nA: before you go to install something to Nvidia, try to completely remove nvidia drivers. there could be nvidia-kernel versions issues. Try this: sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*, restart, sudo apt-get update.\nafter you will go with standard drivers. Then you can try to install additional drivers if they apear in your settings. \nThe fact Nvidia drivers are not present in additional drivers points on some settings problem. If this persist after removing/purge nvidia drivers followed by restart and apt-get update, try to find proper nvidia drivers on asian nvidia website (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)\nAdditionally, you can look into bios settings, some cards has an option to disable 3D. if this is the case do it temporary and see if this will help to solve your problem.\n", "Q: Unity Mail opens Ubuntu Tour instead of account URL in browser The problem is not only with Unity mail but also other applications.

How do I run gdb in the terminal to see what is the error while I run this program? \nThanks in advance..\n\nA: Based on the file extensions (.c), I assume that ex1.c is a C source file. You must first compile the source code before you can debug the application with GDB. Assuming you have GCC installed (available from the gcc package ), you can do this with:\ngcc ex1.c -g -o ex1\n\nOnce compiled, you can debug the application by running:\ngdb ex1\n\nThis will load the executable and dump you at the GDB prompt.

If I install Ubuntu on Samsung Notebook that is Formatted for Spanish will Ubuntu be in English which is preferred ? \nIf I install Ubuntu will I lose my pictures in Google Picasa ?\nI am not real computer literate but tired of Windows.\n\nA: The language which Ubuntu is installed in is selected during the installation process and is not related to the language in which Windows is installed on that machine. It can also be changed after the installation process (which is not true of Windows generally).\nGoogle does not have a Picasa app for Ubuntu, however there are many similar image management programs available in the \"software centre\" in Ubuntu. The pictures on your computer in Windows will be accessible from Ubuntu if you install Ubuntu alongside Windows. You will of course still be able to manage your Picasa photos online in Google+ if you do that currently.\n\nA: First of all, Ubuntu will allow you to choose which language you wish for your Ubuntu Install only. This selection won't affect other operating systems.\nYour pictures in Google Picasa will be permanently deleted if you format (wipe) your current operating system and install Ubuntu as your only OS.\nIf you choose a dual boot, you will be offered to choose which operating system you wish to boot at the very moment that the computer attempts the start up. \nSee the answer to this question: How can I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu? in order to check out how to install a dual boot OS. \nYou may wish to consider a dual boot previous to the full migration in order to face the transition with ease and be able to do certain tasks in your current operating system if you are in a hurry.\nIf you are heading to completely remove Windows in order to replace it with Ubuntu (which is a great idea, indeed), I suggest you to first make a full backup of those things that you don't wish to lose. \nAdditionally you may wish to consider that Ubuntu will offer you certain alternatives (a lot of them) for your current Windows based products. Picasa's alternatives will include (but not limited to) Shotwell for the pictures management.\nAnd my advice will be that if you migrate to Ubuntu, please try to think different and don't try to do things in the \"Windows way\". The tasks are easier in Ubuntu, we just need to get used to the alternatives when migrating.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Language\nYou can use whatever language and keyboard setup during Ubuntu install. \nPicasa\nYou can install Picasa in ubuntu under Wine (Windows emulation) and it works pretty well. It is enough if you just run the setup exe file in wine or there are better howtos fixing some photo upload troubles: (How would I install Picasa 3.9?) \nBackup your database, especially if you have lot of data in recognized faces, places, photo comments etc.  You can use your old database and copy it to the new installation. Doublecheck, that you upgrade to the latest version of Picasa on Windows, so database can be transferred to the very same version in Linux/Wine. But this is not a straightforward process, so you will need some experience. Better would be, if you install ubuntu aside the Widoze, so you will have dual boot and you will be able to access windows files. Then you will be able to transfer the files, photos and picasa database and check that all is working. After you can free the space used by Windoze and use it for better purpose. \n\nA: You can specify your preferred language during the installation procedure.\nUbuntu will not recognize any language of other OS by their own.\nPersonally, I installed Ubuntu in English and then set Spanish for a specific user. You can do the same for any supported language and with all the users that you want to\n\nOthers question that will help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*How To change the Default Language?\n\n*How can I install Ubuntu without removing Windows?\n", "Q: create link (command shortcut) to script I am new to Ubuntu.

Take a look at this link -> https://help.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-help/user-changepicture.html\n\nA: By trying the answer of Senio I had no luck.\nBut with little modification I hit the jackpot :\nsudo -i\nxhost +SI:localuser:lightdm\nsu lightdm -s /bin/bash\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-user-backgrounds 'true'\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background 'path-to-image'\nexit\n\npath-to-image is actually the path where the image you want as log in screen wallpaper is stored e.g. : /usr/share/backgrounds/x.jpg\nI tested it and it's working\nI found this page which offers some tips regarding this problem :\nUbuntu13.04 LighDM\n\nA: I accidentally have found the solution which works great. It even preserves animation of emerging wallpaper during login screen (which i wanted the most). Step by step what i did:\n\n\n*\n\n*(lightDM) Change the wallpaper login screen to default. Type in Terminal:\nsudo -i\nxhost +SI:localuser:lightdm\nsu lightdm -s /bin/bash\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-user-backgrounds 'true'\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background ''\nexit\n\nThis will change logon wallpaper to default. (We need it for animation thing)\n\n*Make a startup program named for example 'WallpaperChange', which executes this line:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \\\n          file:///usr/share/backgrounds/ur_desktop_wallpaper_here.jpg\n\nDuring every startup it changes your desktop background on ur_desktop_wallpaper_here.jpg\nNote: Whole path to ur_desktop_wallpaper_here may be changed.\n\n*The most important thing. Change your desktop background via GUI in Preferences Options on the wallpaper, which you want to have on logon screen.\n\n*Restart your computer.\n\n*Uncheck startup program 'WallpaperChange'. You don't need it any more now. During the next change of the wallpaper you will use it again.\nI had only tested it on ubuntu 13.04 and found a solution by accident. I cannot provide you a technical answer why it works. It may depend on what you had done with your computer before setting logon wallpaper. I will reinstall ubuntu, try this code again and learn if my solution needs any further editing. (Added 4th line in p.1)\nGreets. \n\nA: I am using Ubuntu 14.04 (all Desktop settings are standard and I am using the standard shell) and I think it is even simpler than all solutions stated above.\nThe only thing I do, is downloading a picture or getting one of my own photos, fitting with the screen size, click the right mouse button on the downloaded picture and select \"Set as background\".\nThis process seems to copy the image into the users Picture/Wallpaper folder and, given the right size of the image, will show this picture also at next login.\n\nA: I got the simpler way in Ubuntu 14.04 to solve this problem. You just have to change the permissions of image by typing command in terminal as follows.\nchmod 644 'path-of-file-to-change-permission'\n\nReplace path-of-file-to-change-permission with the path of your picture.\nFor example your background images are in /home/Admin/Pictures then type command as follows.\nchmod 644 /home/Admin/Pictures/*.jpg\n\nThis will work.\n\nA: Ubuntu 18.04 up to 19.10\nYou need to change the path to your background image in the default theme /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/ubuntu.css\n\n\n*\n\n*First backup the file!!!\ncp /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/ubuntu.css /var/tmp/\n\nIn case you have a typo somewhere, you won't be able to access the login screen itself. If you make any mistake, then you have to fall-back to the terminal to revert the change or make a correction.\n\n*Change the background path in the id #lockDialogGroup\nCopy the current image to an unencrypted folder (in case the current image resides inside an encrypted folder) with\ncp \"$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri|sed \"s~'file://\\(.*\\)'~\\1~\")\" /usr/share/backgrounds/current-background.png\n\nAnd add this in the #lockDialogGroup section, for example:\n#lockDialogGroup {\n   background: #2c001e url(file:///usr/share/backgrounds/current-background.png);\n   background-repeat: no-repeat;\n   background-size: cover;\n   background-position: center;\n}\n\n\n*Maybe restart the computer to see the effect.\nsee https://askubuntu.com/a/1071765/34298\nfor Ubuntu 20.04 see How do I change login screen theme or background in Ubuntu 20.04?\n\nA: Simple way, you can change the login background using Nautilus:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Nautilus (in root mode)\n\n*go to /usr/share/backgrounds\n\n*cut/move/delete \"warty-final-ubuntu.png\"\n\n*then choose the picture you want (.png format)\n\n*rename it to \"warty-final-ubuntu.png\"\n\n*then move it back to /usr/share/backgrounds\n\nA: I was able to change the login screen by accident.  It seems to work every time for me. I choose a pic I wanted to use, opened it in Shotwell then Saved it as a PNG format.  Then selected that pic as my background.  Then I logged out and back in and Bam.  The Login screen is the pic I chose.No more ugly orange color.  Now, I need to figure out how to remove the grid on the login screen.\n\nA: step 1. Install ubuntu tweak\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\nStep 2. Start Ubuntu tweak\nfrom commandline: ubuntu-tweak\nStep 3. Change the background image\nGo to Tweaks > Login settings > click to change background image\n\nA: *\n\n*sudo cp your_wallpaper.jpg /usr/share/backgrounds/\n\n*sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/backgrounds/your_wallpaper.jpg\n\n*sudo nano /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/trusty-wallpapers.xml\n\n*Go to the bottom of the file and above the last </wallpapers> tag, copy the text: \n\n<wallpaper>\n    <name>Name_of_your_wallpaper</name>\n    <filename>/usr/share/backgrounds/your_wallpaper.jpg</filename>\n    <options>zoom</options>\n    <pcolor>#000000</pcolor>\n    <scolor>#000000</scolor>\n    <shade_type>solid</shade_type>   \n</wallpaper>\n</wallpapers> <-- This should be the last line - copy the above text\n\n\n\n\n*Save file and exit.\n\n*Open System Settings->Appearance->Look tag->Wallpapers from the expanding window.

I installed Ubuntu because I would like to get into programming. If you could provide me with the simplest instructions possible, I would be grateful.\nI have a Lenovo Ideapad Y500 (Intel i7, NVidia GT 750m, 1TB HDD, 16GB SSD cache, 8GB RAM) with Windows 8 on it. Using a Live CD, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 onto a 75 GB partition. During the installation, I kept all default settings except for one thing; I decided to encrypt my home folder, and so checked the corresponding box. The installation completed, and I restarted.\nOnce I restarted, I saw the options \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Ubuntu, with Linux 3.2.0-23-generic\"\n\n*\"Ubuntu, with Linux 3.2.0-23-generic (recovery mode)\"\n\n*\"Memory test (memtest86+)\"\n\n*\"Memory test (memtest86+, serial console 115200)\"\n\n*\"Windows Recovery Environment (loader) (on /dev/sdb3)\"\n\n*\"Windows 8 (loader) (on /dev/sdb5)\"\n\n*\"System Setup\"\n\n\nI chose the first option, and was directed to a screen with the Ubuntu logo and the row of five dots below that change from orange to white. Then, I was brought to a full screen terminal that prompted me to login, which I did. I saw no option to boot into GUI at all, and am lost. I've been searching around and have tried the \"startx\" command to no avail. Should the command have some sort of context or something?\nI've also tried selecting the recovery mode option from the boot manager. I've tried the resume option from the following menu, which eventually just shuts down the computer after displaying a lot of scrolling text that's too fast for me to read.\nI've also tried the failsafex mode from the recovery mode menu, which only brings up a terminal box at the bottom of the window that covers the entire bottom part of the screen. Commands won't work in this window.\nWhen I try to access Windows 8, I get a message saying that the EFI file path was not specified or something along those lines. I had to enable Secure Boot in order to access Windows 8 (I had disabled it to be able to boot from the Live CD), which is functioning normally. I am at a complete loss for what to do. Any help will be extremely appreciated.\nEDIT: Bonus question! If you could figure out a way for me to boot to Windows 8 without having to enable Secure Boot, it would save me a lot of trouble. I can deal with switching every time, but I'd rather not have to.\n\nA: Your hardware appears to be very new. Much newer than the Ubuntu 12.04 release.\nSpecifically, for your Nvidia GPU (GT 750M) you'll need the 319.17 or newer driver. The 319.x branch is also the latest one, so you don't have much other options than installing the latest in that branch. At the time of writing this is 319.23.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the Xorg-edgers PPA and reload the package sources list. In a terminal run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa   # confirm the question\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install all updates.\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\n*Install the newer 319 driver and the settings utility:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-319 nvidia-settings-319\n\nNote: if you have hybrid graphics (Optimus: both Intel and Nvidia), also install bumblebee-nvidia to be able to use switchable graphics.\n\n*Consider installing the newer 3.8 kernel backported from Raring for your very new hardware:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-raring\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is just one way of installing the Nvidia driver. I like the Xorg edgers PPA, but others like to install it from upstream.\n\n*It's most likely that the next Ubuntu release will provide the 319.x driver in the repositories, so with 13.10 and up this won't be needed anymore.\n\nA: I'm not sure why you're booting into terminal by default, but as for the Secure Boot issue, once you get into Ubuntu properly, you can install boot-repair from the Software Centre and choose Default Repair. That should add an item called something like Windows 8 UEFI to your boot options, which will boot you into Windows 8. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI for more info.\n\nA: One you have logged into the terminal, try the following command:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-dekstop\nIf there is anthing to install anything then continue, and reboot.\nOtherwise can you post the output?\n", "Q: Ubuntu One saved after hard drive wiped? I am pretty sure the answer is \"yes\" to this question, but I felt I had to ask anyway. If I am using Ubuntu One for Mac, and my hard drive might be wiped, will Ubuntu One keep the files I synced most recently before my computer got wiped?\n\nA: Yes. The short answer and maybe the only one is \"Yes\".\nBut... We must consider that the backup on your Ubuntu One cloud will be limited to the storage space available for your account. Usually 5GB unless you upgraded your account. So, if your U1 folder and the additional synced folders exceeds that amount, the files won't be backed up.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to control gnome-terminal from Python scrypt? I am developing an application in PyGtk, and would like to launch a gnome-terminal and output commands to it.\nMy user should then be able to modify the command, or maybe ignore using the up arrow ... etc.\nI have been able to launch a terminal, but can't work out how to send commands.\nThis is how my application starts:\nclass App(Gtk.Window):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self)\n\n        process=subprocess.Popen([\"gnome-terminal\", \"--class=App\", \"--name=app\"], shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n        response,error=process.communicate()\n\n\nA: According to the python docs, you want to use \n  Popen.communicate(input=None)\nhttp://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#popen-objects\nI would recommend that you edit your command from python before sending it to another process. For example, display a window with the default command and allow the user to edit (or cancel) it before executing it. Also, \"gnome-terminal\" is probably overkill for this, \"/bin/bash\" should be sufficient.\nIf that doesn't work for you, you could also try this. (depending on what you are actually running from the terminal) Since you mentioned users could edit the command, it would be a good idea to validate the input before running.\ncommand = ['ls','-l']\noutput = subprocess.check_output( command )\nprint( output )\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. \nSolved it with tmux, thanks to this answer (copied below).\nIn the terminal that should receive the command start tmux with an identifier:\ntmux new-session -s MYSES\n\nSend commands to it with:\ntmux send-keys -t MYSES \"ls -l\"$'\\n'\n\n", "Q: audio cd s not burning to mp3 format-burning to wav format in k3b and brasero using ubuntu 12.04.2 It started in ubuntu 13.04-I was doing what I usually do,I opened brasero to make an audio cd from a few mp3 audio files..When burned I noticed the files on cd were in wav format.I then tried k3b with the same result.At that point and because of several issues with 13.04 I formatted my hdd and dropped back to ubuntu 12.04.On 12.04 I tried brasero and k3b once again with same results.I know that when I used to burn cd s using brasero they were burned to cd in mp3 format not wave.Can anyone tell me a fix for this?I have restricted codecs installed.\n\nA: There is nothing wrong to fix.  The audio format used for audio CD, is the WAVE (.WAV) and AIFF (.AIF) formats.\nSo, for the highest possible fidelity on your audio CD, it is best to burn WAVE or AIFF files. \nIf you want to burn as MP3, then you may want to choose create a Data CD.\n", "Q: Why encrypt the swap partition I have seen on this site that many Linux users encrypt the swap partition. What are the benefits of encrypting swap?\n\nA: Encryption of swap space is used to protect sensitive information. Consider an application that deals with passwords. As long as these passwords stay in physical memory, these passwords will not be written to disk and be cleared after a reboot. If the OS starts swapping out memory pages to free space for other applications, the passwords may be written to the disk platters unencrypted. Encrypting swap space can be a solution for this scenario.\nSwap partitions are not encrypted by default and should be cleared of any sensitive data before continuing.\nThe swap partition can hold a lot of unencrypted confidential information and the fact that it persists after shutting down the computer can be a problem.  \nTo encrypt SWAP, see Encrypted swap partition on Ubuntu\nExtra Reading:Swap encryption, and Ubuntu - How to encrypt swap partition\nSource:C. Brüffer\n\nA: I assume you're talking about a home directory or full disk encryption installation.\nSwap is allocated space on persistent storage (because it's cheaper), providing more virtual memory to the operating system. All your applications run in the virtual memory holding all unencrypted data for the operations. Chances are fairly high that portions of the data you've got on encrypted on disk are ending unencrypted on the swap storage. Also temporary in-memory stuff like encryption keys could be moved from the physical memory to swap for some time (if the kernel decides so). With a plain encryption key an attacker is for certain able to decrypt your whole hard drive.\nMoreover, swap doesn't get wiped after you turn your PC off, unlike physical memory.\nAlso note that if you hibernate your system, all of the physical memory will be written to swap. This provides an even larger amount of data for a possible attacker.\nSummarized, in the context of encryption of data on your machine, it is a very bad thing not to encrypt swap if you handle encrypted files, from a security standpoint. It can even breach the complete security you're trying to achieve.\n\nA: This here is why long ago I got convinced to really encrypt also my swap partition. \nTry the following commands:\nFirst find out your swap device, then find out if your user password (or any string critical for you) is stored somewhere on the swap memory:  \n  $ sudo swapon --summary  \n  Filename                                Type        ...  \n  /dev/mapper/vg_ubu476-lv_swap           partition   ...  \n\n   $ sudo time strings < /dev/mapper/vg_ubu476-lv_swap | grep <any substring of your password>\n\nIf the password is not found, then the command ends with no output. That took 40 seconds for me, with my 4 GiB of swap.\nTry that with \" | more\" instead of \" | grep <...>\"; that will show if you had wiped your disk from the very beginning, before encrypting, with random ASCII or not.  \nBeware of a problem: after those commands your \"substring of your password\" will stay written in your bash history, and you may feel the need to erase it. With \"substring of password\" you have at least not got the complete password there... And: only root can look inside it.\nMy strings command has looked into the decrypted layer of the system, which lives only while running the OS.\nStepping beneath that there are the LVM, then the decrypted LUKS container, and finally the encrypted device (a large partition). You may try and scan them all with \"strings\".\nWhen I did that \"strings\" the first time I found lots of root passwords, as I was using \"su - root\" in the place of \"sudo su -\". Now, with sudo I do not find any. \nPerformance - Belive me: I am working with 1,3 terabytes of encrypted stuff (system + large photo database) on three SSDs on  a Thinkpad W520 whithout feeling any delays. But at least 8 GiB memory may somewhat help.\n\nA: For the same reasons you would want to encrypt main memory. Programs have clear text copies of your information and they get swapped out to disk (swap partition) by the scheduler from time to time. If one were sufficiently motivated and enabled, swap could be mined for that personal data.\nHowever, encrypting swap doesn't matter much if you haven't encrypted your root disk.\nencryption is not cheap, expect a significant performance hit.\nThe only folks I know who \"do it all\" travel extensively. If you just want to tinker, go for it.\nP.S. before someone makes a wisecrack about not being able to encrypt main memory please visit http://bluerisc.com/, even the instruction set is encrypted.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu without losing packages? I'm currently running Ubuntu 10.something and I have some special packages installed for server tasks.  \nI want to upgrade to Ubuntu 12 and I'm afraid that I'll lose these packages.\nSo what will happen if I chose the upgrade option when I put in the installation DVD? Will I lose the packages or not?\n\nA: In theory, the upgrade should smoothly take over your package selection -- with possible exception of packages from outside of the main distribution tree (like custom launchpad repositories). However, to be on the safe side, back up your package selection:\ndpkg --get-selections > packages.txt\n\nLater, you can restore these selections by issuing (as root)\ncat packages.txt | dpkg --set-selections && apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nIn any case, remember to back up your system before upgrading, including /etc. And make sure your backups work!\n", "Q: Minecraft black screen AFTER updating lwjgl Ubuntu 13.04 I am trying to download Minecraft and I get a black screen.

Therefore I need to access those folders shared to the Windows guest system on the host system.\nIs there any sort of reverse shared folder (from guest to host)?\nThe original workaround of sharing the folder via a host-only-network and mounting it on the host system doesn't work because afaik it's impossible to share a drive mapped via network.\nAny suggestions on how to solve this in any way?\n\nA: I have a similar situation here: there is a number of Windows network shares that my Windows guest system is accessing. My solution is just to mount the shares in the Ubuntu host via Samba, using the Nautilus URl smb://.../.... Usually, I then directly access them through ~/.gvfs/.... (or other mount point depending on your Ubuntu version).\nIf you cannot find the share by browsing the windows network, but know the fileserver and the share name, you can enter directly in the Nautilus' address bar (Go -> Location from the menu) the following URL:\nsmb://fileserver/sharename/\n\nAlternatively, you can use the mount command like this:\nsudo mount -t cifs -o username,blah,blah //servername/sharename/ /mountpoint\n\nor use an entry in your fstab. \nBasically, if your Windows guest can access it, your Ubuntu host should be able to mount it as well.\nIn other words, instead of Windows network -> Windows guest -> Ubuntu host I mount Windows network -> Windows guest and Windows network -> Ubuntu host directly.\n", "Q: changing keyboard shortcuts I am running Ubuntu 12.04 and the keyboard shortcuts are not convenient in the terminal for my keyboard.

On Windows it is common, that each program together with all the libraries it depends on is installed in a separate folder. This often leads to a lot of wasted disk space due to libraries being installed multiple times, for each program that uses them. \nOn Linux, programs are installed following the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). This means, that the libraries the programs depend on are all installed in a common dedicated location, so that they are usually only installed once, no matter how many programs use them. Also, programs are built in such a way, that they all use the same version of a certain library. This saves disk space (and RAM at runtime), but has the drawback, that one cannot freely install programs on different partitions or hard disks, at least not without editing system configuration files (for instance /etc/ld.so.conf.d to include the different library folders).\nSince the Debian package system was implemented with the FHS in mind, there is, as far as I know, no easy way to install Debian packages to a folder different from the one they were intended to be placed in and have them working without manually moving and editing files afterwards. This is, because paths are often hardcoded at compile time. So even if you install a package to a different folder, for instance by using dpkg --instdir=folder/ package.deb on the command line, the program will still look for its configuration in '/etc', not 'folder/etc', but the config files that were shipped with the package of course were installed to 'folder/etc'... The program will not be added to the menu either, since menu files are supposed to be in '/usr/share applications', not in folder/usr/share/applications.\nYou can of course manually configure and compile a program from its source code to have it install the binary and data parts wherever you'd like, while still installing configuration files to the FHS compliant locations, but this is something I'd only recommend for advanced users. If you are going to compile from source, have a look at checkinstall, a tool that automatically creates debian packages.\nAnother option, that was suggested on linuxfromscratch, is to unpack the package to a suitable location and then to create symbolic links to all installed files in the corresponding FHS locations.\nSince in the comments you were referring to games: Many games that are not bought through Ubuntu Software Center come as an installer executable, and those can then of course be installed to any folder, usually a subfolder of your home directory. Windows games, which are being run using WINE can also be installed in any directory you want. For wine there exists an environment variable called WINEPREFIX with which you can set up numerous independent WINE folders, each including its own virtual C: drive. Read the WINE man page for more info.\nEven if games/programs come as Debian packages, you can look at the package contents in your favorite archive manager. If the game is going to be installed in /opt, you can usually safely install it to a different folder, since /opt is often used as installation location for programs that don't adhere to FHS.\n\nA: The solution I have used for my Chromebook is to not install packages, but rather, download their .tar.gz counterpart.\nThis may not be what you are looking for, but if you have a very small drive and want to split your vital software (GNOME desktop, web browser) from your additional software (GIMP, IDE, games) to save on some local space and keep your computer working without the external drive, it's the best solution so far IMO.\n\nA: With the increasing number of programs now available as AppImage files, you can of course simply download these to an external HDD and run them from there.\n", "Q: screensaver activates, screen fades, and computer goes to standby when watching video When watching a video in a web browser Ubuntu starts to fade out the screen and eventually goes to black after 2 minutes.

I allocated ubuntu 15gb and im going to load the rest (900gb) for windows but will grub loader work? Or do i have to install windows first and then ubuntu? Thanks\n\nA: Though you can technically install Ubuntu and Windows in any order, I would highly recommend that you install Windows first.  This is because installing Windows on top of Ubuntu will likely result in messing up the MBR.  When that happens, it can be very difficult to boot into Ubuntu, because the Grub dual-boot menu might disappear.  It can be a little tricky recovering from that, which you can read all about here:\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nSo if you have the opportunity to start from scratch, installing Windows first and Ubuntu second could potentially make your life MUCH easier.\n\nA: I would most definitely install windows first, and the reason for that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*This method is recommended by Ubuntu\n\n*It takes very little knowledge and all knowledge needed is easily available here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n\n*You dont have to think about how much space is required or save any partition space for linux. Simply install windows on all of your available space.\n\n*WHEN you start installing Ubuntu simply select \"install along side windows\", pull the handler to the amount of space you want Ubuntu to have available, and the installer will take care of all the partitioning (Which can be complicated for new users).\n\n*Finaly, IF you install windows AFTER you install linux. Windows will delete your boot record, meaning you would have to reinstall it. Thus making things more complicated then it has to be.\n\n\nUsefull tips: If you have trouble booting into linux after installing. Have a look in your BIOS and look for safeboot and (and i stress and) se if this in anyway prohibits other operating systems (It will say so). If so disable it.\nGood luck to you :)\nPS: You might want a little more than 15GB...

Sometimes it takes forever too boot, other times it wont find the kernel image. My system uses UEFI to boot, is there a UEFI alternative to GRUB?\n\nA: I've written a set of Web pages on this topic:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/\nBriefly, boot loader options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB 2\n\n*Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy\n\n*ELILO\n\n*The kernel's built-in EFI stub loader\n\n\nAny of these programs can load a kernel into memory and execute it. In addition, there are separate boot managers available, which present menus of boot options:\n\n\n*\n\n*gummiboot\n\n*rEFIt\n\n*rEFInd\n\n\nThese are usually paired with the EFI stub loader, which lacks a menu of its own. (GRUB 2, GRUB Legacy, and ELILO all have their own built-in boot menus, although ELILO's can only select between Linux kernels, not between kernels and other OSes.) If you like, though, you could use a boot manager with GRUB or ELILO, and use the boot manager just to select between Linux and another OS.\nAs a general rule, people who switch away from GRUB tend to gravitate toward the EFI stub loader, usually in conjunction with rEFInd, or occasionally gummiboot. The EFI stub loader is included in 3.3.0 and later kernels, so you don't need to do anything special to install it. Assuming you can boot into Linux, installing rEFInd should be easy -- just install the Debian package on its download page. gummiboot is harder because the developers don't make a Debian package (or any sort of binary) available. rEFIt is no longer being maintained (rEFInd is a fork of rEFIt, though).

As part of our migration we have found great utilities that transfer mailboxes but transferring PST files to Zimbra usable format is proving challenging. \nI have found some solutions though to make a long story short, I have been able to spin out pst files to a usable format with one exception – \ninstead of putting the mail in that folder a sub directory is created called “mbox” presumably resembling the mbox file that the .eml files are being broken out from. Because each user is different and uses different folder structures from other users, each directory is unknown until the script runs. Additionally the contents of the mbox folder are also unique. \nBecause the folder named mbox is the only constant in these directories I am trying to use find to locate those folders take that folders contents and move them up one directory, then delete the folder named mbox. Here is the actual command as it appears in my script:\nfind localFolders -name mbox -type d -exec mv {}/* .. \\;\n\nor in the example you just gave:\nfind localFolders -name mbox -type d -execdir sh -c 'echo mv {}/* ..' \\;\n\nI am trying to use the * as a wildcard to select everything in the mbox folder . As best as I can tell it is instead being treated as part of the directory, and not the wildcard as intended\nthoughts?\n\nA: In order to do what you want correctly using find you have to understand the following concepts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The working directory of a process.\n\n*The glob feature of bash (or other shells).\n\n\nEvery process in linux has a working directory as part of its internal state. You can imagine it as the \"location\" of the process in the filesystem. The shell is also a process and also has a working directory. The working directory of the shell is the directory (usually) displayed in your prompt.\nWhen a process is created it will inherit the working directory from its parent. If you start a process from the shell then the shell is the parent. Every process can change its own working directory at will. You can change the working directory of the shell using the builtin command cd.\nThe working directory is used when dealing with relative filenames. Relative filenames are filenames that do not start with /. For example when you do cat foo it will look for the file foo in the current working directory, but when you do cat /tmp/foo it will look for the file foo in /tmp.\nWhen dealing with find -exec you always have to think about the working directory. The working directory of -exec is the working directory of find. The working directory of find is the working directory of the shell.\nIn your case:\nfind ./localFolders -name 'file' -type d -exec mv {}/* .. \\;\n\nThe .. will reference to the parent directory of the working directory of mv which is the working directory of -exec which is the the working directory of find which is the working directory of the shell by the time you executed the command. That is not what you wanted.\nThere is an -execdir which is like -exec but it first switches the working directory to the directory where the matching item is found. -execdir is a huge step towards the solution to your question, but there is another problem in your find command: the * a.k.a. glob.\nA glob is something like a wildcard. For example foo* will match foobar and foobaz (and foo because * also matches the null string). So far so good. The interesting part of globbing is that it is done by the shell, not by the executed command. When you execute rm foo* then the shell will first expand the * to foobar and foobaz and then execute rm foobar foobaz. rm never sees the *.\nWhat happens when there are no files starting with foo in the current directory? Then the shell (usually) will not expand the * and will pass the * to the command in verbatim. That means rm foo* will be executed as rm foo*. rm will look for a file named foo* and it will (most likely) not find one and abort with an error. In case you are wondering: yes it is possible for a filename to contain *, no don't try that at home.\nIn your case:\nfind ./localFolders -name 'file' -type d -exec mv {}/* .. \\;\n\nBefore executing the find command the shell will first try to expand the glob {}/*. There are no files matching the pattern {}/* so the glob will be passed verbatim.\nLet's see what the find command does. Suppose you are executing the find command from /home/username/somedir and there exists a directory /home/username/somedir/localFolders/foodir/file with some files in it. find will start searching in /home/username/somedir/localFolders because it is told so in the parameters but the working directory of find is /home/username/somedir because it was executed from there.\nNow find found the directory /home/username/somedir/localFolders/foodir/file. Before it executes the -exec it will replace the {} with the found item. That means mv {}/* .. will become mv /home/username/somedir/localFolders/foodir/file/* ... mv will fail because it will (most likely) not find a file named *.\nSuppose there is a file named * then mv will move the file to ... Remember that the working directory is /home/username/somedir. That means mv will move the file to /home/username/somedir/.. which is /home/username. That is not what you wanted.\nThe \"fix\" for your find command depends on several factors. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there \"dotfiles\" in the file directory? Dotfiles are files with names starting with a dot. The * glob will (usually) not expand to filenames starting with a dot.\n\n*Are there other directories in the file directory? find will try to recurse in to them but fail because they have been moved.\n\n*Are there directories named file in the file directory? Where should those files go?\n\n*Are there a gazillion files in the file directory? That might mess up the * glob expansion.\n\n*Are there filename collisions with files out of the file directory? Should they be overwritten?\n\n*Are there spaces in the filenames? That will mess everything up.\n\n\nTo fix your find command I will happily ignore all those factors.\nHere is a fix using -execdir and sh -c to delay the expansion of *:\nfind ./localFolders -name file -type d -execdir sh -c 'mv {}/* ..' \\;\n\nSince the * is in quotes it will not get expanded ahead of time. When -execdir executes the command then sh -c will expand the * in the working directory.\nHere is another fix without sh -c:\nfind ./localFolders -path \"*/file/*\" -execdir mv {} .. \\;\n\nI used -path to find all items under directories with the name file. The * are in quotes so they will not get expanded ahead of time. This time find takes care of the interpretation of the *. Note that this will also match something like ./localFolders/foodir/file/bardir/file/somefile. As said I happily ignored that factor.\nAnd for the sake of completeness another fix without -execdir:\nfind ./localFolders -name file -type d -exec sh -c 'mv {}/* {}/..' \\;\n\n\nA: How about this?\nfind ./localFolders -name 'file' -type d -execdir bash -c 'mv -vnt . -- \"$0\"/*' {} \\; -prune\n\nSafe regarding spaces and funny symbols in filenames.

Discovering I needed Wine to run anything Windows-based. I discovered I'd need DirectX to do anything significant, which in turn needed .NET framework. Using this (http://www.dedoimedo.com/games/wine-directx.html) tutorial for DirectX and downloading Wine 3.5 off of WineTricks, I thought I had everything sorted. Unfortunately, I don't. What worked fine on Windows either doesn't work or runs like it was stuck in molasses. Now, I know there are a lot of programs that have compatibility issues with Wine but what I don't understand is the slow-running programs part. Here are my system specs: \nToshiba Satellite L455D-S5976\nCPU: AMD Sempron SI-42 Single-core 2.1 GHz\nRAM: 3GB (2.7 technically)\nHDD: 500GB\nGPU:  ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3100\n\nHere's a partial list of the games I've been trying:\n\n\n*\n\n*Supreme Commander\n\n*Command and Conquer: Generals (Zero-Hour)\n\n*Assassin's Creed\n\n*World in Conflict\n\n*Star Ruler (Blind Mind Studios)\n\n*Trackmania (Nadeo)\n\n*Battlefield 2\n\n*X3:Terran Conflict (Egosoft)\n\n*Rubber Ninjas\nSim City 4\n\n\nI would think that it was just my system being slow—I don't have the system requirements to really run AC—but here's the weird part. In the opening intro, it'll run at around 10FPS for about 3 seconds, and then 60 or so, faster than it ever had on my previous laptop which was actually better than this current one. And, for example, games like Rubber Ninjas, C&C, SupCom, and WiC all ran smoothly on my first laptop which was similarly specced to this one.\nOh! And another quick question—when I first installed WINE, unconfigured, I installed Derek Smart's Universal Combat and it worked fine. Now after some other games and some reconfiguring, it won't work at all, even if I reset to default settings.\nSo, am I doing something wrong? Does Wine need to be configured differently? I'm completely lost, here, and any help would be -greatly- appreciated, thank you. I do sincerely apologize for the wall of text, here, but I didn't want to leave any detail out, as that tends to make things harder for all parties involved.\nP.S: I recently discovered ClockGen, found here (http://www.techspot.com/community/topics/overclocking-a-toshiba-satellite-laptop.32667/): and was wondering, is overclocking a viable solution? I don't remember what command I used to find my CPU speed—but it said my current speed was 2100MHz (aka 2.1 gigs), but the kicker was that my “max” speed was 4,000 MHz. Now, I would never DREAM of overclocking a laptop, or even a desktop, to that ridiculous speed, but even if I could get 2.4 or 5 out of it...and I would take full responsibility for the wrath I incur from the laptop gods. I would never run this thing unplugged—I don't anyway already so a battery's pretty much moot for me...and I have a high-speed fan running under any laptop at all times—scorched my pants with my first laptop and have been wary ever since.\n\nA: TL;DR: This post explains how to run any game using Proton\nProton is a software that allows you to run Windows games on Linux. It is developed by Valve.\nIt is essentially a \"Wine distribution\", in the sense that it uses Wine in the background, but it is enhanced.\nThe Wine version that comes with it has been compiled with parameters that enhances speed. Most importantly, the wined3d stack, which translates DirectX calls to OpenGL, has been substituted. If the game runs on DirectX 9/10/11, DXVK is used to translate DirectX calls to Vulkan. If the game runs on DirectX 12, VKD3D will translate DirectX calls to Vulkan. These implementations are much much faster than the native ones.\nAlthough Proton is \"normally\" used by Steam to run games downloaded by Steam itself, you can ticker with it to run any game you wish. For example, I am running Overwatch (downloaded through Battle.net) using Proton.\nHere is a concept of proof on how you can use Proton to run any game.\nWe won't be compiling Proton from sources. Instead, we will use the pre-compiled package that comes with Steam. So, first of all, download Steam, run it, and have it download a version of Proton.\n\n*\n\n*Locate Proton folder. This usually will be a sub-folder under $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common. In this folder you can find different versions of Proton, each in its own subfolder. Choose a version of Proton (most likely you will want the most recent one). In this example we will use Proton 5.13. Copy the \"Proton 5.13\" subfolder somewhere else, let's say in $HOME/bin/Proton\n\n\n*Open $HOME/bin/Proton/proton (it's a Python 3 script) and comment out the line\nself.env[\"WINEPREFIX\"] = g_compatdata.prefix_dir\nby putting a # before it. We don't want Proton to run the above line. We will provide our own WINEPREFIX.\n\n\n*Locate Steam's COMPATDATA folder. This usually will be a subfolder of $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata. In that folder you will find different subfolders whose names are made up entirely by numbers. This number-only subfolders are COMPATDATA folder. For example, my COMPATDATA subfolder is $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/389730. Substitute the last part with your own number. In case multiple numbered folders show up, choose the highest number.\n\n\n*VERY IMPORTANT: if you have more than one graphics card, for instance integrated and dedicated (like most laptops), DXVK require you to specify which one to use (you will want to use the dedicated one). See DXVK README on how to achieve this. Basically run:\nvulkaninfo | grep \"GPU id :\"\nyou will obtain an output like:\n\nGPU id : 0 (GeForce GTX 1060):\nGPU id : 1 (Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630 (CFL GT2))\n\nThe name in parentheses are the names of your graphic cards. Choose one for DXVK. We will choose the NVIDIA GeForce one in this example. DXVK can match sub-strings! So it is sufficient to use \"GeForce\". This is non-ambiguous and DXVK as said can match on sub-strings. So it will know which one to use.\n\n\n*Choose a WINEPREFIX (basically a location) in which to install your game. $HOME/.wine is fine for most users.\n\n\n*Here is a concept of proof of the script to run your game using Proton. Save it somewhere and name it launch_proton.sh. Call it like this: ./lunch_proton.sh game.exe. (of course remember to chmod +x launch_proton.sh). SUBSTITUTE THE VARIABLES AT THE START OF THE SCRIPT WITH THE VALUES YOU FOUND IN THE PREVIOUS POINTS.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# Modify these\nexport DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME=\"GeForce\"\nprotonfolder=\"$HOME/bin/Proton\"\nexport STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=\"$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/389730\"\n\n# Modify if needed\nexport WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine\n\n# This should be fine for most users\nsudo sysctl dev.i915.perf_stream_paranoid=0\n\"$protonfolder\"/proton run \"$1\"\n\nThe script needs sudo privileges due to the line\nsudo sysctl dev.i915.perf_stream_paranoid=0\nwhich improves performances. If you remove this line, the script will run without sudo privileges.\n\nA: You may not want to hear this but if you enjoy a lot of Windows-only software and need it to perform as well as it would on Windows then dual-booting - having an actual bare-metal Windows installation - is the best way to achieve this.\nAny kind of emulation layer, and Wine is an emulation layer despite what people say the name stands for these days, has the potential to degrade performance.\nIn particular, DirectX is a big and complicated beast and providing an entire emulating API for it adds a huge amount of weight, so any 3D game is going to suffer greatly under Wine.  Subroutines that are hardware-accelerated in Windows may be emulated in software under Wine, or they may be hardware-accelerated but in a different, and less efficient way.  The bottom line is a lot of the time you will get severely degraded performance.\nWine is a great exercise in providing API compatibility for Windows applications, and should be admired for the success it has had in doing so, but one should never expect anything to perform as it would in Windows itself.\nNote: some decent games are natively available for Linux, through Steam or otherwise, and should run well enough on Linux.  What won't run as well are games released exclusively for Windows, particularly if they use DirectX which will be the heavier, slower emulation on Wine.\n\nA: Read up about the vblank=0 setting that can be used before launching wine. Some ATI drivers set vertical sync to the monitor or in catalyst disable tearfree and the vertical syncronization.\n\nA: The issue with 3D performance is usually related to the poor/wrong driver, be it Windows or Linux.\nIf you have a generic driver under Windows, you can't do much about 3D performance.\nIf you have the right driver under Linux, 3D performance is at least as good as it would be in Windows with a good/right driver.\nWhat Wine does is provide the execution platform for Windows programs under *nix. It does not emulate Windows OS, but rather translates OS API calls to *nix equivalents.\nOne detail though, if you run Windows x86 (32 bit) programs on an x64 Linux, you need 32bit video drivers too! Otherwise, a generic driver is used or some sort of software translation to the x64 driver takes place (not sure), which is bad for performance.\nFrom my experience, some old games for Windows (XP) run better under Linux than under Windows 10 (eg. Half-Life), with fewer crashes.\nSince kernel 4.10 I don't remember any issues with video drivers on nVidia and Intel GPUs.\nnVidia tends to have better drivers for Windows than for Linux though (remember why Linus Torvald showed the middle finger to nVidia?). There is an open source version of nVidia drivers called \"nouveau\", created through reverse engineering. It might be slightly slower than the proprietary one, but it has decent performance and stability.\n\nA: Wine isn't made for games. You can try playing games with wine but it will be very slow or it will have problems.\nYou can try PlayOnLinux. See if that helps.\nDownload PlayOnLinux in the software center.\n\nA: Run the game through the terminal using opengl wine /path/to/file/filename.exe --opengl\n", "Q: Granting administrator privileges to user not working?

Any idea what I'm doing wrong?\nAlso tried this solution and it didn't work.\n\nA: Um, there is a slight confusion as to how sudo works.\nSudo allows you to become root (or other user) for the purpose of running a certain command. However, it is not automatically invoked when you run the command apt-get; you need to run sudo:\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nand not\napt-get install firefox\n\nOtherwise you are not invoking sudo at all! You see, sudo is not a system thing. It is just a regular program that runs always with root privileges (suid, in other words).\n~$ ls -l `which sudo`\n-rwsr-xr-x 2 root root 127668 2013-02-27 21:41 /usr/bin/sudo*\n\nSee this star and the \"s\" in the permissions? That is what it means -- whoever runs sudo, sudo runs with the permissions of root; just as if root has started it. And then it looks around, sees that it is you who run it, looks up the sudoers file and says: fine, you are allowed to run apt-get as root, let me run that for you. And invokes apt-get with root permissions, which has the same effect as if root has run that.\nIf you do not use sudo, but just type\napt-get install firefox\n\nThen apt-get is run as regular user and naturally has no permissions to touch the files which can only be opened for writing by root. This is because apt-get is not a suid program; it runs with the permission of that user who started it.\nSuid programs are dangerous, because if there is any error in the program, it can be used to escalate the privileges of a non-authorized user. That is why only one program (sudo) exists for these particular purposes.\nFine. About that password thing: use the NOPASSWD directive in the sudoers file (use visudo to edit it) and run the command with sudo. Here is the appropriate entry to your sudoers file:\nyourusername ALL = NOPASSWD: /path/to/the/program\n\nThat way, invoking\nsudo /path/to/the/program\n\nwill not require to type a password and you will be able to run it from a script or through cron.\n", "Q: how to resize page back to normal size I have a dell inspiron mini with floating touch pad bout 4 years old.\nI accidentally, by pressing on lower right edge of unit, miniturized the\nimage on the page.

Can you help ?\n\nA: Since the issue is related to the touch pad probably because you used the touchpad to scroll down whilst holding down the control key, that leads to the image becoming smaller overall, if you revert that action by scrolling up while holding the control key, it should come back to the size you wish. \nIs this simply with web pages or is this an issue with all apps that you're running?\n", "Q: Files lost during move & power failure I was moving (using the default Ubuntu file manager) some photos from my SD card (formated FAT32) to a NTFS drive on my computer when a power failure occured. \nAfter that, I used the SD card in my camera, made some new pictures and then moved all the pictures from the card to another computer.\nAfter starting the first computer, some 2 Gb of files where missing from my SD card, and the folder where I moved them was shown empty in Ubuntu.

You notebook has 2 video cards, with the idea that slow but cool HD400 works by default, switching to hot and powerful one when needed. (which one do you have by the way? They vary in this model). In Linux, this does not work out of the box, and you always have both video cards on, resulting in maximum heat. \nIf you are OK to go without big GPU, you can just disable bigger video card altogether.

ifconfig reporting the correct network addresses and that the connection was up and running, I could ping my laptop from the pc but had no internet access. \nIn my case it was down to also having a GUI network manager, Wicd, which must have been intercepting the connection, because by enabling the wireless lan via the GUI interface, the internet access came back up.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on Android phone (HTC Desire) I want to install Ubuntu on Android device.

No Risk: You can wait until this is better supported, and easy to install.\n\n(2.) Medium Risk: Try Ubuntu Touch on an ASUS Nexus 7 ..\nHow to install -- Release notes -- Using the device\n\n(3.) High Risk: Try installing (on your device).\nwiki.Ubuntu > Touch > Devices > bravo  (aka HTC Desire)\nNOTE: This appears to be work-in-progress.\n\nA: The ubuntu mobile version hasn't been released yet. If you go to ubuntu's home page, you can sign up to a mailing list to be notified when it comes out.\nIt is possible to install ubuntu anyway, but you will no longer have a phone, and it will likely drain the battery much faster than when using android. You will need to back up your phone, \"root\" it (android version of jailbreak), and then use the ubuntu installer app from the app store. I've looked in to doing this, but haven't done this before, and this isn't the place to ask about it. You will have to search for a forum or something to guide you.\n\nA: If you're willing to root your phone, you can try this app.\n\nA: I tried Linux on Htc Desire HD. Kali and some Arch Linux. Both work perfectly under the Linux Deploy at NVC. De facto its totaly useless. Apparently the software centre was working but without possibility of installing any apps.

If I can close any windows, it will close step by step slowly slowly. Why is it this much slow? This is the 3rd or 4th time I am installing Ubuntu on my laptop and I always had this problem. Please help me with your solutions. \n\nA: I cannot really tell what the problem is from you description, if English is not your first language I suggest a good spell checker to help with some of the editing. Try Lubuntu 13.04, it is based on Ubuntu 13.04, but is lighter on your computer's  resources. I have never had a problem. Takes about maybe >15-20 minutes to do a full clean install. Also the community here is pretty awesome, and the things you do in Ubuntu can be done in Lubuntu. It helped me out with my laptop problems (Mine is a HP Compaq nx6325 with AMD Turion64 x2 mobile processor.\n\nA: Please consider the idea of testing different Ubuntu flavors as Live media PRIOR to installing.\nAs you say you have a Samsung Mini, I guess - this being a netbook - it doesn't have a optical unit so you're only left with the option of LiveUSB.\nDownload some/all of Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu and try each one as LiveUSB.\nSee how responsive is each of them on your system as Live media and based on this real usage test choose in the end the one that works ok on your system.\nGood luck and let us know how it works!\n\nA: I have installed Lubuntu and Xubuntu successfully on the same hardware.  The performance, although not amazing, is more than acceptable.\nTry installing Lubuntu or Xubuntu on your computer and see if that helps.  Better still, try the live media before you install as suggested.  Keep in mind though:  A proper install will be more responsive than a live boot.\n", "Q: missing libjpeg.so.62 from ia32 shared library I am trying to install a chemical/molecular biology modeling program called Molsoft ICM-Pro.  Initially after downloading the program and trying to open, it gave me error messages that I was missing shared libraries, and after talking with my network administrator he recommended I install the ia32 shared libraries using\n\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nWhich gives\n\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n  Reading package lists...

Is there a shared library that could be missing that would contain these files?  I am an ubuntu noob, so sorry if the information I provided was unclear.\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!\nbtw I am using ubuntu 12.04 dual boot with windows on an HP pavilion dv6 \n\nA: sudo apt-get install libjpeg62:i386\n\nFor other libraries, the same applies but find the correct name of the package providing the specific library. The \":i386\" suffix tells Ubuntu to install the 32 bit version of the library (i386 architecture) because your architecture is 64 bits and by default it would install packages for it.\n", "Q: apt-get does not install dependencies When i try to install the gnutls libraries (libgnutls26), and the generic linux kernel headers (linux-headers-generic),\nI get the following error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n\nlibgnutls26: Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14) but 2.15-0ubuntu10.4 is installed\n             Depends: zlib1g (>= 1:1.1.4) but 1:1.2.3.4.dfsg-3ubuntu4 is installed\nlibgnutls26:i386: Depends: zlib1g (>= 1:1.1.4) but 1:1.2.3.4.dfsg-3ubuntu4 is installed\nlinux-headers-generic: Depends: linux-headers-3.2.0-41-generic but it is not installed\n\nHow can I fix this error?\n\nA: Install aptitude using:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nThen do:\nsudo aptitude install libgnutls26\n\nAptitude will show the problems and propose a solution. \nThe first proposed solution will be to keep everything as-is. Answer 'n' to that question. \nThe next proposed solution will be to downgrade all of the dependencies that are currently too new. Answer Y to that.\nThen, try installing libgnutls26 again.\n\nA: Not sure if there is conflicting dependencies already installed, but go to the terminal and type sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade\nTell me what message (if any you get like a 'warning...' or 'error..') you get. Also if you are trying to install GnuTLS go to synaptic package manager in your system tools menu, and do a search for it. When you find it right click and select install, and it will bring up the dependencies you need and install them as well.\n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu!\nIn order to resolve dependencies, type in a terminal sudo apt-get -f install.\nIf all fails, simply manually install missing packages (by typing sudo apt-get install <name of package>).\n", "Q: Connect Playstation Console via VPN to the internet I have a VPN connection to the internet with my PC and want to connect my Playstation 3 to the internet.

Perhaps you have to install this application first.\n\nA: You can use a vnc server to share your desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC. Next you will need a vnc client at the other end, something like Remmina (preinstalled) for ubuntu or RealVNC for windows.\n", "Q: Are there any shortcuts are available in Ubuntu like open a window or some built-in applications? Instead of using mouse every time, are there any shortcuts are available in Ubuntu? If yes, can anyone provide me with a list?\n\nA: Hold the Super key (the windows/mac logo) to get a list (provided you are in a recent enough version of Ubuntu)\nOr in System Settings -> Keyboard you can set your own/edit current shortcuts.\n\nA: Hold your super key (windows button) for a while then a list of short cuts will appear before you.\nfor instance, if you press any number with windows key it is same as clicking any icon on the launcher.\n\nWindows+1 \n\n", "Q: Browser launch is slow on ubuntu 13.04 64-bit Google chrome takes 16 seconds to start initially.

As far as I can remember it is a utility which analyses your usage patterns and preloads the relevant libraries to memory, thereby reducing the startup times of your applications.  It certainly won't do any harm.\nTo install from the official repo's do:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nfrom the command line.\n", "Q: Minutely cron job is not running I added the line \n*/1 * * * * /home/zach/test.sh\n\nto my crontab, where the contents of /home/zach/test.sh are as follows:\ntouch /home/zach/test.txt\n\nYet, no file test.txt is being created in that folder. Is there any reason why cron wouldn't be performing the desired job?\n\nA: First, your test.sh file should look like:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntouch /home/zach/test.txt\n\nif you want it to be a bash script.\nSecond, be sure that this script has permissions of executing. To do so, run this command in terminal:\nchmod +x /home/zach/test.sh\n\nThird, be sure that you have permission to create new files in /home/zach. \nFourth, add your new cron job using crontab -e command.\n\nA: try * * * * * /usr/bin/sh /home/zach/test.sh\n\nA: The /1 is unnecessary. Just do\n* * * * * /home/zach/test.sh\n\nEDIT: I wrote \"In fact, I think that /N means \"skip every N-th instance\", and in that case will result in skipping every instance. \" This is not true, it means \"every N-th instance\". Therefore both variants work. Therefore, I will remove my answer. I think you have a permissions problem.

How can i digitally sign? In microsoft i am using signtool.exe to sign which signs by using a certificate.\n\nA: I would use GPG for that. For details, read this guide. GPG can be used to generate a digital signature detached from the binary file. It can be checked against a binary using your public key, therefore ensuring that the file is exactly the same file as the one that has been used to generate the signature with your private key.

However, I can hear audio,and the pavucontrol Play tab shows the name of the application(any media player vlc,mplayer etc.) which is running and volume control for right and left channels (FROM LEFT & FROM RIGHT Volume slider) .  I am attaching screen shot when I am listening songs.\nI guess there may be a change in the system configuration/setting? How to reset it?\nI have reinstalled Pulseaudio, but the problem remains.\nI am using ubuntu 12.04 with default pulse audio.\n\n \n\nA: I got the solution, it was a simple case of the monitor being muted.\nIn pavucontrol go to input devices, then in the show button at the bottom switch it to All input devices. I believe it's normally set to all except monitors, so the monitor doesn't show up. In my case it was this monitor that was muted, but I could still hear sound because the internal audio wasn't muted.\nHope it helps someone\n\nA: Pavucontrol is not configurable other than it saves it's windows dimensions in ~/.config/pavucontrol.ini after program termination to open it with the same size next time. However it usually will increase the windows height adapting to needs when there are more lines to display. Factors which may possibly lead to a wrong windows height may come from larger fonts in our theme.\nThe only instance I was able to reproduce a missing volume meter was when the windows geometry was smaller than needed:\n\nIn this case we can either increase the windows size manually, or we can scroll down the application area to reveal the hidden VU meter:\n\nIf this still does not give us a VU meter for reasons unknown to me we may as workaround install and run pavumeter  to display the output volume of a playing stream.\n\nA: I have come across this little problem that VU meter doesn't show anything, including pavumeter. The problem is that only \"monitor of card\" has a volume control. So sometimes it is appears to be muted.\nRestore the volume level of \"monitor of\", which is in the Input Devices tab of pavucontrol, and everything will work as before.\n", "Q: Black screen after selecting an option from grub boot menu I installed Ubuntu 12.04 as a dual boot, but I'm having trouble getting it to start. I just ran it off a live USB and installed it like that, using the Install Ubuntu alongside Windows option and just followed the prompts to install Ubuntu 12.04.\nWhen I start the computer I get to the GRUB boot menu screen and select Ubuntu, but it just goes to a black screen. The only thing I can do from here is to press Ctrl+Alt+Del to reboot it, but it just keeps happening over and over. It also happens if I select the Windows or Ubuntu (recovery mode) options from the GRUB boot menu. \n\nA: Try repairing the GRUB bootloader with Boot Repair. Boot to an Ubuntu live session from the live USB/DVD that you used to install Ubuntu. While running an Ubuntu live session open the terminal and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair  \nsudo apt update  \nsudo apt install -y boot-repair\nsudo boot-repair  \n\nOpen the Boot Repair application and select Advanced Options -> Main Options tab -> check Reinstall GRUB and Unhide boot menu as shown in the below screenshot. Click the Apply button. Then reboot the computer with sudo reboot \n\nIf the OSs were installed in different modes, dual booting Windows and Ubuntu can't work. If your Windows is installed in BIOS mode, it is recommended to install your Ubuntu in BIOS mode, but if it's installed in UEFI mode, then do the same with Ubuntu. \n\n          BIOS vs. UEFI\nTo check whether your computer has UEFI or BIOS firmware open the terminal and type dmesg | grep \"EFI v\"\n\n\n*\n\n*This will return a line like this, if the system was booted from EFI:\n[ 0.000000] EFI v2.00 by Lenovo\n\n*Or it will return nothing if it was booted from BIOS.\nIf you have installed Ubuntu in legacy mode on the same drive with GPT partitioning, you can use Boot Repair's Advanced options to uninstall grub-pc and install grub-efi-amd64. That converts the Ubuntu installation from BIOS boot to UEFI boot, the same firmware as most recently manufactured laptops with Windows pre-installed have.\nConverting Ubuntu into UEFI mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Boot-Repair, and select Advanced options -> GRUB location tab.  \n\n*If you do not see a Separate /boot/efi partition option, this means that your PC does not have any UEFI partition.  \n\n*If you see a Separate /boot/efi partition option, put a checkmark in the checkbox to the left of it, then click the Apply button in the lower right corner.  \n \n\n*Set up your BIOS so that it boots the hard drive in UEFI mode. The way to adjust this setting depends on the specific model of the computer, but generally this setting is located in the boot priority settings under the Boot tab of the BIOS/UEFI setup utility.\nFor more information about converting Ubuntu into UEFI mode review https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI in the section about Converting Ubuntu into UEFI mode. \nThe grub bootloader can also be converted in the opposite direction from UEFI to BIOS. Linux can boot fine from a GPT disk in BIOS mode. See this answer: Convert from EFI to BIOS boot\n\nA: Boot into a live CD and run this code:\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\nsudo boot-repair\n\nChoose the recommended repair and follow the instructions you are given. Once boot-repair is done, reboot and see if Ubuntu starts correctly.\n", "Q: Is there any way to combine to internet connections I have two network interfaces which are a wireless and a mobile broadband. They have different networks or service provider. I plan to combine them for faster upload and download speeds. Is there  any good way of doing this?\n\nA: You might want to search for the term \"bonding\". This will allow you to use two connections in parallel. You will not be able to use the full bandwith of all connections with a single transfer, but if you have multiple transfers they can be routed through both connections for load balancing.\nThis seems like a pretty solid guide: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/debian-ubuntu-teaming-aggregating-multiple-network-connections.html\n", "Q: Pipe an infinite stream to internal loop? I've seen a lot of things about redirecting stdout to a TCP socket, but no real example of how to do it in practice, specifically when the output stream generated by the first \"command\" never ends.\nTo talk about something concrete, let's take programs like servers that typically output their log endlessly to stdout (well, as long as they run). If you redirect the output to a log file on the disk, then this file is always open (therefore not readable by others?) and grows infinitely, which eventually is going to cause problems.\nThis might be a nood question, but I don't know what it does or how to do it so.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to redirect the output of a command to the internal loop?\n\n*I want to make sure that data is sent EVERY time something is written to stdout, and that the pipe won't wait for the command to end (never happens ideally!). Is that right?\n\n*If 2 is true, is there a buffer system to send chunks of data once it reaches a certain size only?\n\n*Could you give me concrete command line examples to do the above?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Use netcat\n\n\n*\n\n*Install netcat-traditional  or netcat-openbsd \n.\n\n*On the receiver end, open up a listening socket:\nnc -l 1234\n\nwhere 1234 is the port number to listen on. By default netcat uses a TCP socket.\nThis will run continuously until it receives an EOF. If you need to turn that off, add the option -q -1 (negative wait timeout - see manpage).\nOptionally, redirect the output to a file or pipe it, e.g.:\nnc -l 1234 > mylogfile.log\n\n\n*On the sender end, fire up the command and pipe the stdout to netcat:\nmycommand | nc 123.45.67.89 1234\n\nwhere 123.45.67.89 is the IP address of the listening end and 1234 is the port number again.\nThis will run continuously (streaming the data) until the mycommand outputs an EOF.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHow to redirect the output of a command to the internal loop?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by the \"internal loop\", but redirecting output is a very general question for your shell.\n\nI want to make sure that data is sent EVERY time something is written to stdout, and that the pipe won't wait for the command to end (never happens ideally!). Is that right?\n\nPipes in the shell won't wait for an EOF to pass the data, as far as I know.\n\nIf 2 is true, is there a buffer system to send chunks of data once it reaches a certain size only?\n\nYes, the general buffers in the pipes as described in the suggestion of ignis in his comment: Question on UL: Turn off buffering in pipe.\nTCP will handle buffers on the TCP level.\n", "Q: How do I go back to 12.04?

But recently I want to install windows again as I have come to know that My laptop has a touch-screen and I just want to feel that. Is there any way to free up some memory and install windows alongside Ubuntu? this is my laptop spec.\n\nA: The answer to this question depends on the filesystem you used for your Ubuntu installation. If it's ext*, you can for instance use gparted (from a live-CD) to shrink the Ubuntu partition.\nAfter that you'll probably have to reinstall the bootloader, but if you install Windows, it will overwrite the bootloader, so you'll have to reinstall it after Windows installation anyhow. \nBeware, that Windows 8 (at least the 64bit version) requires your PC to boot using EFI, what might cause troubles if you installed Ubuntu using BIOS emulation (Ubuntu might not boot at any more at all - and I don't know how to fix that).\n", "Q: script to compress multiple files I have a script that generates backup and finds files older than 30 days and compresses them.

I tried reinstalling grub-uefi-amd64-signed, running grub-install --uefi-secure-boot, copying grubx64.efi to /EFI/Ubuntu/ and adding the bootloader entry using efibootmgr, with no success. The bootloader just loads Windows (or PXE if no Windows is installed).\nI tried changing the BootOrder via efibootmgr to make the Ubuntu entry the only option, with no success. Also tried setting the entry name to \"Windows Boot Manager\", didn't have any effect.\nA trip to the BIOS Setup didn't help much. I can disable SecureBoot but I want to keep Windows8 setup in UEFI mode, and apparently I can't have Ubuntu installed alongside it. Also I don't see any section in the BIOS for adding additional UEFI bootloader keys. \nHas anyone had any success booting Linux with Secure Boot enabled on this device ? Or on a similar Toshiba (Tecra) model ?\n\nA: I've experienced dual-booting with dual-boot and UEFI. Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot from BIOS (Keep it disabled, as it prevents booting once installed)\n\n*Install Ubuntu normally\n\n*Open up a Terminal from the live CD and run:\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\nsudo boot-repair\n\n\n*Choose the recommended option and follow the instructions it gives you\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Your computer should boot straight into GRUB, with Ubuntu as the main option\n\n\nA: You do not need Secure Boot to boot Windows. If you're insistent on keeping Secure Boot because you (or your employer) want its benefits, you can almost certainly get it working; but if you're insistent on this point because you think disabling Secure Boot will prevent you from booting Windows, you needn't worry. Thus, I recommend you disable Secure Boot. Even if you want to keep it enabled in the long run, disabling it in the short term is a useful diagnostic tool because it will help you zero in on the cause of your problem. Even if it doesn't seem to help at the moment, keep it disabled until you can successfully boot Linux, then try re-enabling it. If you disable it, find it doesn't help, and immediately re-enable it, a subsequent attempt that should have worked might fail because of Secure Boot and you'd be none the wiser.\nIf you can boot with Secure Boot disabled but not with it enabled, you'll need to replace Ubuntu's outdated shim 0.1 with either shim 0.2 or PreLoader. These tools are all described on my Web page on Secure Boot. You might also want to consult my rEFInd Secure Boot documentation, which is more focused on rEFInd but might still be useful even if you're not using rEFInd.\nIn brief, Linux Secure Boot solutions involve running a Secure Boot program (shim or PreLoader), which add a new type of Secure Boot authentication to the system. These programs then launch the \"real\" boot loader (typically GRUB, but you can launch rEFInd or some other boot manager or boot loader, too). The boot loader checks back with shim or PreLoader to verify the authenticity of the kernel (or can choose not to do so, depending on the software involved), thus providing a link in the chain of trust. The trouble is that getting this all installed and set up can be tricky, since the relevant cryptographic keys or binary hashes have to be stored somewhere -- in the shim binary or in NVRAM. If you go with a non-Ubuntu solution, you'll need to store at least one key or hash (Ubuntu's) in NVRAM, and getting it in there requires a bit of juggling, as described on my Web pages. This isn't all that hard to do, but it requires some user interaction; if it didn't, it would be too easy for malware to install itself in a similar manner.\n", "Q: How to create a remote desktop connection between two Ubuntu PCs I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 as a server on a PC, but I am unable to connect via remote desktop from my another Ubuntu PC.\nCan you help me?

I followed the instructions from Ubuntu wiki for tilapia step by step. The fastboot method ended up with terminal saying \"waiting for device\" while the N7 booted into fastboot mode by itself. I waited for several hours, nothing happened. Manual install method in recovery aborted because the zip is for grouper and won't install on tilapia. \nCan someone please help me? As a long-term Ubuntu user on PC and laptop I am eagerly waiting for Ubuntu touch on a tablet. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: First identify that you are indeed in fastboot, you can do this looking at the screen and noticing:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Start label with something resembling an arrow pointing to the power button.\n\n*An open android.\n\n*Text with device information.\n\n\nWith the cable plugged in, run:\nfastboot devices\n\nIf it doesn't return anything while in fastboot mode it's most likely a permission problem, by running\nsudo fastboot devices\n\nyou can prove that it is. To get this working and continue your workflow either use sudo or make sure the proper udev rules are in, to create on, look at dmesg while in fastboot mode and identify a line similar to:\nNew USB device found, idVendor=18d1, idProduct=4ee0\n\nIf you have adb-android-fastboot installed you can look at:\n/lib/udev/rules.d/70-android-tools-fastboot.rules\n\nto replicate them in /etc/udev/rules.d/ or propose a fix with a patch to android-tools, the easiest way to do this is through a bug in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/android-tools/+filebug\n\nA: It looks like your problem is that your driver is installed incorrectly. As a result, your computer cannot see your devices response. To fix this, try installing PdaNet.\nDuring the installation, keep your device unplugged until told to plug it in, and be sure that USB Debugging is enabled under Developer Options. If you don't see Developer Options in your settings menu, go to About Tablet, then tap Build Number seven times. This will enable Developer Options. After installing PdaNet, you should be able to install Ubuntu Touch without issue.\n", "Q: Make Ubuntu host ignore NIC, and let VM guest fully control it Is it possible to make a Ubuntu desktop host (running on a physical machine) ignore a network interface card (NIC, ethernet), and let a virtual box guest take full control of that NIC regarding IPs, etc? \nThe Ubuntu host has access to the network through another NIC.\nIf this is possible, could it be done in a simple way (using the graphical Network Manager).

I am a beginner so please donot use complicated terms\n\nA: This is the crucial part in your message ... \n\n\n*\n\n*\"The disk contains an unclean file system\" \n\n*\"The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state\"\n\n\nRemember... windows discs need to be checked for filesystem problems. \nYou can try to fix this from Ubuntu with ntfsprogs. If not installed ...\nsudo apt-get install ntfsprogs\n\nand this will try to clean the disc ...\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sda3\n\n\nntfsfix is a utility that fixes some common NTFS problems. ntfsfix is NOT a Linux version of chkdsk. It only repairs some fundamental NTFS inconsistencies, resets the NTFS journal file and schedules an NTFS consistency check for the first boot into Windows.\nYou may run ntfsfix on an NTFS volume if you think it was damaged by Windows or some other way and it cannot be mounted. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also follow the last remark: mount the disc in readonly. You can then extract the contents to another disc. \n\n*If the disc do not have anything important you can also format them and ditch ntfs altogether.\n\n\n\nI also found this on the ntfs-3g page and is probably important too since it has the exact same message (caveat: the solution requires a working Windows 8...): \n\n\"Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount\"\nWhen dual booting with Windows 8, trying to mount a partition that is visible to Windows may yield the following error:\n\n The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\n Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\n Failed to mount '/dev/sdc1': Operation not permitted\n The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\n Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\n read-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\n\nThe problem is due to the new Windows 8 feature called \"fast startup\". When fast startup is enabled, part of the metadata of all mounted partitions are restored to the state they were at the previous closing down. As a consequence, changes made on Linux may be lost. This can happen on any partition of an internal disk when leaving Windows 8 by selecting \"Shut down\" or \"Hibernate\". Leaving Windows 8 by selecting \"Restart\", however, is apparently safe.\nTo enable writing to the partitions on other operating systems, be sure the fast restarting of Windows 8 is disabled. This can be achieved by issuing as an administrator the command: \n\n powercfg /h off\n\n\nYou can check the current settings on Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options > System Setting > Choose what the power buttons do. The box \"Turn on fast startup\" should either be disabled or missing. \n\nBest course of action: re-install Windows 8. Fix the problem with the disc. Install Ubuntu.\n\nA: First, don't worry about your swap partition; it's used as an adjunct to RAM and is not meant to be mounted like most partitions. Thus, the fact that it doesn't show up in your file manager is not a problem.\nSecond, you should not use NTFS on a Linux-only computer. What Rinzwind posted is partially correct, in that recent versions of Windows don't completely shut down their filesystems on system shutdown or reboot and so aren't very multiboot-friendly. Rinzwind is overly optimistic about the ntfsfix program, though; it only does the simplest checks and then flags the filesystem for further checks in Windows. Since your filesystem is in an inconsistent state, this won't help at all; you must check the filesystem in Windows before you can mount it again. The need for such checks is one reason that using NTFS on a Linux-only system is not a good idea. Broadly speaking, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain a Windows recovery disc, boot from it, and tell it to repair the errant filesystem. Such discs are readily available on the Internet; here is one link, although I can't promise that they'll work for you, especially since the link provides Vista and Windows 7 repair discs, and you said the computer started life with Windows 8. If you have problems, try a Web search to locate a newer repair disc.\n\n*Physically move your disk from the current computer to another one that runs Windows, and use that Windows installation to repair the problem filesystem.\n\n\nIn either case, be cautious about which partition you repair; you do not want to set Windows loose on your Linux partition. Thanks to a poor choice of filesystem type code on GPT disks, this could happen; Windows will see your Linux partition as an unformatted one, and so might try to \"fix\" it, in the process trashing your Linux installation. I therefore recommend using gdisk to change the type code of your Linux partition from 0700 to 8300. See my Web page on this topic for more information about this.\nOnce you're done, I strongly recommend you back up your NTFS volume, convert it to a Linux-native filesystem (ext3/4fs, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS, or Btrfs), and restore the files. This way, you'll be able to perform filesystem repairs using Linux-native tools. The filesystem will also perform better; the NTFS-3g drivers that Ubuntu uses are sluggish compared to either Windows' own NTFS support or Linux drivers for its native filesystems.\n\nA: You are not able to open windows partitions that have gone into hibernate. You need to really shut down windows to open these partitions in Ubuntu. \n", "Q: How do I add an additional IP address to /etc/network/interfaces? I have an extra IP address available to my server, and so I need to assign it in the interfaces file. At the moment, I've got this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n  auto eth0\n\niface eth0 inet static\n  address aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa\n  netmask 255.255.254.0\n  gateway bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb\n  dns-nameservers ccc.ccc.ccc.ccc ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd eee.eee.eee.eee\n  dns-search vps-number.com\n\nWhat do I add/assign my new IP address (fff.fff.fff.fff)?

Example from https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration#Multiple_IP_addresses_on_one_ :\nauto eth0\nallow-hotplug eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.42/24\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.43/24\n\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.44/24\n\n# adding IP addresses from different subnets is also possible\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 10.10.10.14/24\n\nSo just the solution above but drop the :x suffix, which as Heihachi points out is outdated.\n(The ip addr suggestion is the worst. It's ugly and incomplete, as you'll have to also add a down variant or ifdown won't work very cleanly.)\n\nA: For an extra IP address, I usually add:\nup ip addr add fff.fff.fff.fff/prefixlen dev $IFACE\n\nto the bottom of the iface eth0 inet static stanza for future reboots and then run the command sudo ip addr add fff.fff.fff.fff/prefixlen dev eth0 again manually to activate it directly.\nIf your netmask is 255.255.254.0 then prefixlen should be 23 for you.\nI'd love to know if there's a better way, though.\n", "Q: Problem with QtCreator after update I installed the ubuntu-sdk 2 days back on my machine (12.04) and the Qt version that is installed is 5.0.2.

You are accessing the site via http://localhost/tshirtshop, while your /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/tshirtshop  file's documentRoot and directory have /var/www/tshirtshop. This means that this file is not used as the config for localhost - according to those values site should be accessed from just http://localhost not http://localhost/tshirtshop.\nThis could happen if the file was not created in the /etc/apache2/sites-available folder and then enabled in the terminal (which would create a symbolic link to sites-enabled) after the default was disabled.\nI don't know the enable and disable commands, since I use webmin to handle the setup of local test sites for me. And then edit my /etc/hosts file to be able to access on something else closer to the real url rather than localhost.\nBut back to the problem, using the wrong URL causes your rewriteRule to rewrite to hhtp://localhost/index.php?DepartmentId=2 which would be correct if the site was accessed via just http://localhost and not http://localhost/tshirtshop. You can now see why you get a 404 error.\n", "Q: Errors with Vagrant and Ubuntu 12.10 with RVM Installed Vagrant via sudo apt-get install vagrant, and every time I try to run some vagrant command, such as vagrant init precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box I get the following error:\n/home/novito/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p195/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.0.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:45:in `require': cannot load such file -- log4r (LoadError)\n    from /home/novito/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p195/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.0.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:45:in `require'\n    from /usr/bin/vagrant:2:in `<main>'\n\nNot sure why rvm gets involved here, but oh well, I hope you guys can guide me on how to solve this.\n\nA: When you installed Vagrant using apt-get it would have installed all its required dependencies for the standard Ubuntu-packaged version of Ruby. But your error message indicates that when you run vagrant it is trying to use a version of Ruby (and its Gems) that is managed by RVM rather than the system version, and your version of Ruby is missing at least one of its dependencies, log4r.\nI think you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Revert to using the system (standard Ubuntu) version of Ruby by running something like rvm use system --default to reset RVM by default, and only change Ruby versions when you need to.\n\n*Switch back to the system version just when running Vagrant, so run rvm use system before running vagrant in the same shell.\n\n*Identify all the Ruby Gems that Vagrant depends on and manually install them in your RVM-managed Ruby installation. This would be a fiddly approach, though. It used to be possible to install Vagrant itself as a Ruby Gem, so you could have installed it in your RVM-managed Ruby installation, but that is not supported any more.\n\n\nSee the RVM command options documentation for more detail on controlling which version of Ruby you are using.\n\nA: After I downloaded and installed Vagrant from the download page the error goes away.\n\nA: I had this issue as well.  As it turns out, apparently you need ruby 1.9.3.  I had installed Vagrant from source with 2.0.0 and the aforementioned error occurred until I reinstalled the gem with ruby 1.9.3.\n\nA: I had a old custom ruby environment installed in my home (~/.rbenv) and this apparently overrides all the default system Ruby packages.

Is this possible without just doing it manually?\n\nA: You could try something like this:\nI'm not sure if it needs something more but this should work.\n    cat playlist.m3u | I=1 while read file; do\n        mv $file $I.$file.mp3;\n        I=$I + 1;\n    done;\n\nEdit: You could need I=`expr $I + 1'; instead of I=$I + 1;\n\nA: Assuming you have a file my_playlist.txt that contains the tracks in the order you want to play them, e.g.,\ndancing all night long.mp3\ncharles trenet - je t'aime mon amour.mp3\nmon petit poney - bo.mp3\ncharlie parker - donna lee.flac\n\nand assuming that this file is in the same directory you have your music files. If this is not the case, please specify your question accordingly.\nThen (observe good bash practice that will work with file names that have spaces in them):\n#!/bin/bash\n\npl=my_playlist.txt\n\n# need number of files, to know the number of leading zeros\nn=$(wc -l < \"$pl\")\nlz=0\nwhile ((n)); do ((++lz)); ((n/=10)); done\n\ni=1\nwhile read f; do\n    [[ -z $f ]] && continue\n    if [[ ! -f $f ]]; then\n        printf \"*** Error, file \\`%s' not found.\\n\" \"$f\"\n        continue\n    fi\n    printf -v target \"%0*d.%s\" \"$lz\" \"$i\" \"$f\"\n    echo mv -vn -- \"$f\" \"$target\"\n    ((++i))\ndone < \"$pl\"\n\nIf you run it as is, the renames will no occur, because of the echo in front of mv. This is just a little test. When you're happy with it, remove the echo and the rename will take place. The mv command has the two flags -v and -n:\n\n\n*\n\n*-v: be verbose (I like to know what's happening)\n\n*-n: no clobber, so as to not overwrite otherwise existing files (safer)\n\n\nNote about the printf command. It looks a little bit ugly, but there's nothing to be scared about. The part %0*d will take the two arguments $lz and $i and will be replaced by the number $i with $lz leading zeros. Then the %s will be replaced by the third argument, which is the file name. All this will be put in the variable target, thanks to the -v option. So that target will be something like:\n0001.title of the file.mp3\n\nAdapt and extend to your needs!\n\nNow let's assume you've been playing with that, and you want to undo the renaming...\nthere are two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*You only have files of the form XXXX.YYYY where XXXX are digits, and you'd like to remove the digits and the period from the name:\nshopt -s extglob\nfor i in +([[:digit:]]).*; do\n    target=${i#*.}\n    echo mv -nv -- \"$i\" \"$target\"\ndone\n\nand remove the echo when you're happy.\n\n*You only want to do it for the files in your playlist my_playlist.txt:\nshopt -s extglob\nwhile read f; do\n    a=( +([[:digit:]]).\"$f\" )\n    if ((${#a[@]}==0)); then\n        printf \"*** Error: can't find a match for file \\`%s'\\n\" \"$f\"\n    elif ((${#a[@]}>1)); then\n        printf \"*** Error: found several matches for file \\`%s':\\n\" \"$f\"\n        printf \"    %s\\n\" \"${a[@]}\"\n    else\n        target=${a[0]#*.}\n        echo mv -nv -- \"$f\" \"$target\"\n    fi\ndone < my_playlist.txt\n\nand as usual, remove echo when you're happy.\n\nA: I use Dolphin, a replacement for Nautilus and all I need to do is select the files I would like to rename, right click on the selection and...\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Skype crash immediatly after launch when I'm launch skype, it crashes immediatly.\nError: \nmathieu@mathieu-desktop:~$ skype\n`menu_proxy_module_load': skype: undefined symbol: menu_proxy_module_load\n\n(skype:10442): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load type module: (null)\n\n`menu_proxy_module_load': skype: undefined symbol: menu_proxy_module_load\n\n(skype:10442): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load type module: (null)\n\n`menu_proxy_module_load': skype: undefined symbol: menu_proxy_module_load\n\n(skype:10442): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load type module: (null)\n\n`menu_proxy_module_load': skype: undefined symbol: menu_proxy_module_load\n\n(skype:10442): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load type module: (null)\n\nAbandon (core dumped)\nmathieu@mathieu-desktop:~$ \n\nCan you help me?\nThank.\n\nA: I had the same error.\nIn my case it depended to xorg.conf\nI have a NvidiaCard inside my Laptop, and for another program i created the xorg.conf - file through the Button \"Save to X Configuration File\".\nTo this time everything worked fine, but after this Skype crash after the launch.

I use Notepad++ on Windows 7 and I want to know if there is a good substitution for it on Ubuntu. \nI want something that is good for editing html files.\n\nA: I would recommend Atom. Advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*multi-platform (works also on Windows, MacOS),\n\n*developed and backed by GitHub,\n\n*based on standard technologies like Chromium web browser and JavaScript,\n\n*and therefore has huge base of extensions for many use cases.\n\n\nA: Actually you can install Notepad++ by installing wine first:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install wine\n\nBut some good alternatives are:\n\n*\n\n*Vim\n\n*Emacs\n\n*Geany\n\n*kate (in KDE, running in unity with the installation of the proper\nKDE dependences)\n\n*Sublime (free, unlimited trial version/ or $70.00 US Dollars)\n\n*GEdit\n\n*Komodo Edit (in KDE)\n\n*Editra\nOf these, Geany and GEdit are my favorites, but it depends on your needs. If you are looking for something more complex, there is the Aptana Studio which I mentioned in detail as an answer in this question: Basic Web Development IDE/Editor like Dreamweaver?\nGood luck!\n\nA: Thanks to the work of Daniel Di Sardi there is an editor inspired to Notepad++ for Linux: \nNotepadqq is a Notepad++-like editor for the Linux desktop.\n\nIt has a nice PPA (the home page says it's for 14.04, but the launchpad has versions from Utopic  to Xenial), so you can install easily by \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:notepadqq-team/notepadqq\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install notepadqq\n\nAs another option, SciTe is based on the same \"editing building block\" of Notepad++, Scintilla. \n\nA: Nowadays I would recommend Visual Studio Code. It's free, open-source and runs everywhere!\nWikipedia says:\n\nVisual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is also customizable, so users can change the editor's theme, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences. It is free and open-source, although the official download is under a proprietary license.\nVisual Studio Code is based on Electron, a framework which is used to deploy Node.js applications for the desktop running on the Blink layout engine. Although it uses the Electron framework, the software is not a fork of Atom, it is actually based on Visual Studio Online's editor (codename \"Monaco\").\n\n\nA: Three other alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gedit\n\n*Bluefish (Ubuntu Software Center)\n\n*Aptana Studio 3\nBluefish is very good for HTML and CSS in my opinion.\n\nA: Other alternatives which have rich features including easy-to-use macro tools:\nKKEdit\n☞ http://www.webupd8.org/2014/03/kkedit-text-editor-inspired-by-bbedit.html\n☞ https://github.com/KeithDHedger/KKEdit\n☞ http://linux-apps.com/content/show.php/KKEdit?content=158161\n\n*\n\n*The usual source view options, split-view, line wrap, line numbers etc.\n\n*Full source code highlighted printing.\n\n*Standard text search OR regex search in current or all open files.\n\n*Jump to function declaration, Find Function declaration.\n\n*Find API declarations in installed Gtk-Doc's.\n\n*Find and open include file.\n\n*Multiple bookmarks.\n\n*Run external tools.\n\n*Save/Restore session.\n\n*Run external tool synchronously or asynchronously.\n\n*Pass selected text to external tools.\n\n*Spell checking via ASpell, check selected word or check document via tab menu.\n\n\nmedit \nOfficial site\n\n*\n\n*Configurable syntax highlighting.\n\n\n*Configurable keyboard accelerators.\n\n\n*Multiplatform - works on unix and windows.\n\n\n*Plugins: can be written in C, Python, or Lua.\n\n\n*Configurable tools available from the main and context menus.

But, you can \"evaluate it\" as much as you want. (Sublime website says \"There is currently no enforced time limit for the evaluation\" )\n\nA: It is actually possible to install Notepad++ on Ubuntu. Just run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nThen, download the Notepad++ Windows installer, right click it, and select Open With -> Wine Windows Program Loader. Follow the typical installation process and you should be able to open Notepad++ from your Dash.\n\nA: Brackets is a modern, open source text editor that understands web design. It's crafted from the ground up for web designers and front-end developers.\nIt is available for many OSs and works pretty good with Ubuntu. To install Brackets in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo snap install --classic brackets\n\n\n\nA: I've not been able to get notepad++ to work with wine/ubuntu. Nevertheless, you can install notepadd++ as a snap and it works just fine.\nGo to https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/snappy and follow the links. Snaps are available for a variety of containerized software packages. The snap \"store\" is located at https://snapcraft.io/store. The homepage is https://snapcraft.io .\nOr check out https://linuxconfig.org/a-beginner-s-introduction-to-snaps-the-universal-linux-package-format or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager).\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 and later\nNotepad++ (notepad-plus-plus) is a snap package in the default repositories of all currently supported versions of Ubuntu. To install Notepad++ open the terminal and type:\nsudo snap install notepad-plus-plus  \n\nTo add Notepad++ navigation to other drives besides the default drive:\nsudo snap connect notepad-plus-plus:removable-media\n\n\nEven though the window title says [Administrator] this file is opened with normal user permissions in Notepad++.\n\nA: Try eric4.\nI use both notepadd++ on windows and eric4 on Debian. Eric is superior in many ways to notepad++ in my opinion and is free.\n\nA: Have a look at scribes.

I'd like to take a look to the source code but I can't find the right folder.\nNo the folder in the home directory, the one where the source and configuration is stored, a cd banshee isn’t going to work, I obviously need the right path.\n\nA: First thing make sure you download the code. The source code does not get downloaded by default (to save space).\nRun this in a terminal (we are first creating a folder to contain the source files):\nmkdir ~/banshee-source-dir\ncd ~/banshee-source-dir\napt-get source banshee\n\nif everything went OK, there should be a folder ~/banshee-source-dir/banshee-<version> inside which the source code is located.\nNotice that you can also browse the code on GitHub.\n\nA: From Where can I find the source code of Ubuntu?:\nOpen terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get build-dep $package\n\nwhere the word 'package' indicates the source code of the program you desire to download.\nthen type:\nsudo apt-get source $package\n\nIn your case, to download Banshee's source code, type:\nsudo apt-get build-dep banshee\nsudo apt-get source banshee\n\n", "Q: Best container/compressor for nesting Is there a format, such as 7zip, zip, tar.gz etc that that 'glues' pre-compressed folders together quickly? At the moment, it appears that archiving pre-compressed files/folders has very little benefit when compressing up the parent directory. \nI don't care which format I use or compression rates, so much as ensuring that the end result is a single file.\n\nA: gnu tar without the \"z\" option glues the file without compression, files are stacked into the tar archive. Recovery of a single file is slow due to sequential read \nformats like rar or zip use file indexing to permit quick recovery, these formats have option to disable compression. \n", "Q: Cron job bash script to restart desktop sharing? I'm having trouble with desktop sharing crashing while during remote sessions. Is there a way to set cron to check and restart, if necessary, the desktop sharing application with a bash script?\n\nA: Script:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ \"`pgrep vino-server`\" = \"\" ]; then\n   DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/lib/vino/vino-server --sm-client-disable >/dev/null 2>&1 &\nfi\n\nDon't forget to give it execute permission: chmod +x /path/to/script.

If you don't have it, request one from your manufacturer.\nFor now,\ntype this in your terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nHowever, you may get close with Ubuntu in the mean time, until you are able to recover your laptop's factory state.\n\nA: May be you wi-fi needs special drivers? Go to System settings->Software and updates -> Additional drivers and see if it suggests something. \nAlso, sometimes Ubuntu installs damaged, but works fine after reinstallation. Why this happens is a mystery for common people. \n", "Q: Screen is flickering on max resolution I got a new pc with an Intel i7 4770 with no extra video card. So this pc uses the Intel HD 4600. My monitor is one from Dell. It's the U2711. The max resolution of the monitor is 2560x1440. To connect the pc to the monitor i am using a dual link DVI cable. Thats for the setup.\nAt first i cant get full resolution through the gui. The option 2560x1440 is not shown. But i found this script\nxrandr | grep maximum &\nsleep 2\ngtf 2560 1440 60.0 &\nsleep 2\nxrandr --newmode \"2560x1440_60.00\" 311.83  2560 2744 3024 3488  1440 1441 1444 1490  -HSync +Vsync &\nsleep 2\nxrandr --addmode HDMI1 2560x1440_60.00 &\nsleep 2\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --mode 2560x1440_60.00 &\nexit 0\n\nThe script will change the resolution successfully. But after a while (~30 secs) the monitor starts turning black and back on. Its flickering. Do you have any ideas?\n\nA: It turned out my motherboard wasn't capable of doing 2560x1440 over the DVI port. Only over HDMI but that wasn't alright for my monitor. Ended up buying a new video card. \n", "Q: Setting up on a Poweredge 2400 I just received an old Dell Poweredge 2400. I have only been able to successfully install Ubuntu Server 8.10 on this system. But as this is no longer supported I was wanting to see if there are any supported versions I can run on this system. I have tried insatlling several other versions but the installs have been unsuccessful.\n\nA: To upgrade to a newer version, type do-release-upgrade in a Terminal. This should install the latest version of your operating system. For more detail, follow the instructions here.\n", "Q: Why am I given the option to also encrypt my home folder after I've selected system encryption? I am installing Ubuntu 13 with full encryption but why am I given the option to also encrypt my home folder. Surely the home folder is covered under the system encryption? I'm confused.\n\nA: These are 2 different ways of encryption. If your /home already resides on encrypted partition, then the second one is redundant. It just encrypts your /home/user with your user's password by putting your /home/user into a virtual device. \n\nA: You are being offered 2 layers of Encryption.\nThe first is LUKS. With LUKS your entire installation (except /boot) will be encrypted, including your home directory.\nThe second is ecrptfs and is used to encrypt your home directory.\nIn general there is no need to use the two together, but, you could if for example you have multiple users and you wish to keep data encrypted between users or from root access.\nWhen you use LUKS, when you boot, the data in your /home will be decrypted and as long as the system is running, the data can be read by root and other users.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Policies#Permissive_Home_Directory_Access\nIf you so desire , you can restrict access to the data in your home directory by adjusting the permissions or by encrypting your home directory as well.\nIf you encrypt your home directory, your personal data will remain encrypted when the system boots and will only be decrypted when you log in.\nHTH\n", "Q: How do I prevent apt-get from upgrading packages built from source with apt pinning? I have a package installed (xcp-xapi) which is prone to a bug. The fix is very simple (only a couple of lines in the code) so what I do is the following:\napt-get source xcp-xapi\n\nThen I find the source file to apply the fix and then I run again\napt-get -b source xcp-xapi\n\nThis will produce some .deb files that I install using\ndpkg -i *.deb\n\nNow the problem is that every time I try to run an apt-get upgrade, apt tries to fetch the packages from the repositories. I guess this can be fixed using pinning, but I cannot find the proper configuration to put in high priority the packages I compiled on my own.\nSo the question is how can I configure pinning to put the following already installed packages on higher priority than any existing in the repositories?\n# apt-cache policy xcp-networkd xcp-v6d xcp-xapi xcp-xapi-debug\nxcp-networkd:\n  Installed: 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1\n  Candidate: 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1\n  Version table:\n     1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1 0\n        500 http://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/ precise-updates/universe amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/universe amd64 Packages\n *** 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1.3.2-5 0\n        500 http://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/ precise/universe amd64 Packages\nxcp-v6d:\n  Installed: 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1\n  Candidate: 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1\n  Version table:\n     1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1 0\n        500 http://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/ precise-updates/universe amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/universe amd64 Packages\n *** 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1.3.2-5 0\n        500 http://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/ precise/universe amd64 Packages\nxcp-xapi:\n  Installed: 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1\n  Candidate: 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1\n  Version table:\n     1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1 0\n        500 http://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/ precise-updates/universe amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/universe amd64 Packages\n *** 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1.3.2-5 0\n        500 http://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/ precise/universe amd64 Packages\nxcp-xapi-debug:\n  Installed: 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1\n  Candidate: 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1\n  Version table:\n     1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1 0\n        500 http://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/ precise-updates/universe amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/universe amd64 Packages\n *** 1.3.2-5ubuntu0.1 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1.3.2-5 0\n        500 http://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/ precise/universe amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: I don't know if this is the proper solution, but trying different pinning configurations, I end up made it working like this:\ncreate the file /etc/apt/preferences.d/xcp-xapi with the following contents:\nPackage: xcp-networkd\nPin: release n=precise\nPin-Priority: -1\n\nPackage: xcp-v6d\nPin: release n=precise\nPin-Priority: -1\n\nPackage: xcp-xapi\nPin: release n=precise\nPin-Priority: -1\n\nPackage: xcp-xapi-debug\nPin: release n=precise\nPin-Priority: -1\n\nFrom what I understand, giving it a negative priority to the specific package from the specific repository means do not bother for this package, thus keep the current version installed. If someone can explain further or provide a \"more correct\" solution, I would appreciate it. Thank you!\n\nA: One way might also be to send a bug report and patch to the developers of the xcp-xapi, and over time the bug might be fixed in the repositories. Then you can install the version from the repository again. That said, it might take some patience before the repositories are updated.\n", "Q: after a reboot banshee cant find music files (stored on D: partition with ntfs format) i recently made the step towards ubuntu 13.04 and while using banshee as well as with rythmbox every time i restart my machine she cant find my music files.\n(big ¨!\" in front of the songs) i have to delete my library and import it again and its just fine again.. till i restart.\ni have my music stored onto a seperate partition with ntfs format.\n(i put it there while using win7)\nany ideas?\n\nA: The problem is that the D: partition is not automatically mounted by Ubuntu, so Banshee can't find it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Run the command sudo apt-get install nfts-config\n\n*Search for NFTS Configuration Tool in your Dash\n\n*Open it and select the D: partition, then configure it to mount automatically.\n\n\nYou may need to reboot your computer, but Banshee should work after that.\n", "Q: Why does the installation of Ubuntu is taking 4 hours?

Is this a misprint or something on the website? \nDownload link here http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04/release/ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-amd64+mac.iso\n\nA: Most people are using usb drives these days are they are easily available, reusable, and less expensive.\nAt any rate, some .iso are larger then 700 mb but burn to iso with no problem.\nIf you wish to use a CD, burn it and report any problems.\n\nA: This is just classic confusion between MegaBytes ( base 10 ) and so called MebiBytes ( base 2 ).  In base 2 units, a MB = 1024 KB, and a KB = 1024 bytes, so 693 MB = 693 * 1024 * 1024 or 726,663,168 bytes.  So the image is in fact 693 MB.\n", "Q: installing Ubuntu onto the same HD I have XP Pro on C drive and there is plenty of room left on said drive.

Is making the partition with  Windows installer a two part operation? First make the partition then go and do the install of Linux.\n\nA: The Windows installer does not create a partition. It instead installs Ubuntu as a program. This installer only works on Windows 7, so do not try it on XP.\nTo dual-boot the easy way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Desktop Installer (it should be an ISO file) and burn it to a CD. \n\n*Boot your computer into the CD (you may have to modify the boot order in your BIOS)\n\n*Choose Install Ubuntu.\n\n*When asked how you want to install Ubuntu, choose Install Ubuntu alongside Windows XP.\n\n\nFollow the installation procedure and you should be fine. You do not need to create any partitions because Ubuntu does that for you. If your computer boots into Windows instead of GRUB, reboot into the CD, choose Try Ubuntu Before Installing, and open a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T). Then, run sudo apt-get install boot-repair followed by gksudo boot-repair.

At least as far as I can see, the main advantage of running virtualbox is to be able to simultaneously use two operating systems.

Any help in where this file may lie? I have tried searching for any/everything related to guvcview, and have had zero success.\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully providing a solution..\n\nA: The documentation is wrong, or at least out of date. For the version of guvcview currently in the ubuntu repositories (1.7.1), the configuration files are written to:\n~/.config/guvcview/videoN\n\nwhere videoN corresponds to the device (/dev/video0, /dev/video1, ...)\n\nA: Quote from Official Documentation:\n\nGuvcview stores all options into a configuration file named\n  .guvcviewrc, this file is stored in the user home directory. The file\n  is opened at start and it is rewritten at exit. By removing the file\n  the default values will be loaded, and a new file will be written at\n  exit.\n\nYou can specify config file using -g option\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 booting into busybox after update Every time the system updates the kernel from 3.5.0-24 to 3.5.0-34 I get dropped into a busybox prompt at boot, but I can boot just fine using the previous kernel. I've tried all I know. I did a fsck.ext3 -f /dev/sdb2 using the alternate install CD. I've used boot-repair but to avail, I've checked for bad blocks but there are none. Should I purge the new kernel and use the old one instead? This is the output from boot-repair the first time, no purge. http://paste.ubuntu.com/5809230/\n\nA: Fixed it, using boot-repair, I added the kernel option rootdelay=90. Now the linux-kernel-3.5.0-34-generic-image. But after much research and testing, I have decided to go with the linux-generic image boots properly. which is kernel version 3.2.0-48. It's the only one that boots up correctly without having to add any kernel options. Also using this kernel solved another issue I had, which was a waking up took too long. Now waking up after suspend takes just 2 seconds as opposed to 10-20 seconds using the other images.\n", "Q: How to start, stop and restart rtorrent? I just installed rtorrent on my Ubuntu Server 12.04 machine via apt-get.\nHow do I start | stop | restart the service?\n\nA: The accepted answer is correct but does not specify how to perform a \"safe\" shutdown of the rtorrent service with a systemctl service script.\nMost existing answers or scripts \"kill\" either the screen session or the rtorrent process itself. In doing so, they send a SIGINT (2)or SIGQUIT (3) signal which stops/kills the rtorrent process. The drawback is that typically the lock-file of rtorrent is not deleted because rtorrent was not shut down properly. Consequently, the next start of rtorrent would fail because of the persistent lock file.\nTaking a look at the source code of rtorrent shows that it expects a SIGTERM (15). Hence, considering a systemctl service script the stop command could look like:\nExecStop=/usr/bin/kill -s 15 \\`pidof rtorrent`\n\nIf pidof is not available you can also use something like: \nps -A | grep \"rtorrent\" | awk '{print $1}'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*ps list the current processes\n\n*grep extracts the rtorrent process particulars\n\n*awk selects the pid and displays it to stdout\n\n\nIn case you need to wait until shutdown is complete, you can use killall -w. Note that:\n\nkillall may wait forever if the signal was ignored, had no effect,\n  or if the process stays in zombie state (source: man killall).\n\n\nA: To start rtorrent, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nrtorrent\n\nTo stop Ctrl+D\nTo quit Ctrl+q\nThe above commands you do after pressing Enter, in the rtorrent window.\nFor more information see the output of:\nrtorrent -h\n\nand/or see Using rtorrent like a pro\n", "Q: Cant recognize live usb when booting Could somebody please help me with this?

I want to change my IP address and IP location manually or randomly for using the Internet anonymously, but I can't find the correct way to do this. \nPlease help me find any software to do above things.\n\nA: You can use Tor for this. \nThis link will help you get it installed: Installing Tor\nTo know more about Tor, check out: http://torproject.org\nThis is how Tor is officialy described:\n\nTor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against\n  a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and\n  privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state\n  security known as traffic analysis\n\n\nA: Another option would be sign up for a vpn service like private internet access. A VPN service like PIA will route your ip address through their servers and randomly assign an ip address to you from their available ips which will greatly increase your privacy while on the web. \nHowever some of these services keep logs of the different ips that were assigned to you which could conflict with your privacy if these logs were accessed by external entities. \nKeep this in mind if you end up looking for a vpn service. PIA states that they do not keep logs and it is only about $6 US per month for their service. They also have servers all over the united states, canada and europe so making a strong connection to one of their servers should be quite easy. Hope this wasn't too much of a plug for PIA.

I've got an older hard drive that I have recently re-formatted to ext4 and would like to use it as a spare of a spare backup.\nBefore I put any data on it, I was wondering what tools, or applications, that I can use to test its health and reliability.\nI have run a fsck against it and smartctl tools indicates that the drive is healthy. \n\nAre there any other utilities that I could run against this drive to give it a basic health pass? This is not mission critical. I am just looking for some additional day-to-day utilities to ease my mind. Thanks.\n\nA: S.M.A.R.T data is the way to go - it is the black box of your hard drive.\nWhat matters the most is the \"Attributes\" tab that contains detailed SMART data. The overall \"passed\" might sometimes be deceiving. Currently the attributes tab is red and that means some attribute is red (some attribute has grown beyond threshold). You should check out what it is.\nThere are lots of attributes and you can read about them  here.\nBut in short if you see \"Current Pending Sector Count\" you should be in cold sweat and if it is \"Uncorrectable Sector Count\" or \"Offline Uncorrectable\" or \"Off-Line Scan Uncorrectable Sector Count\" it is time for heartbreak. In the first case the problem might go away and in the second case it will not (but it will get worse for sure). In both cases it is time to back up everything and prepare for possible hard drive failure.\n\nA: badblocks with its -w flag will give your drive fairly exhaustive testing (but will destroy the contents, so don't use it on a drive that has data you want to keep).\n\nA: You can use \"Disk Utility\" \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Disks application from the Dash.\n\n*Select the disk you want to check from the Storage Devices list. Information and status of the disk will appear under Drive.\n\n*SMART Status should say \"Disk is healthy\".\n\n*Click the SMART Data button to view more drive information, or to run a self-test.\nand if  you want to use command line then you can run following command :   \nsudo smartctl --all /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: How to take control over update action?

You may want to consider switching to rEFInd, which is under active development. (I maintain it.) Among other improvements, rEFInd has much better support for Linux and better options for setting the default OS.\nSecond, there's an error in the specification of the file to be edited; it should be /efi/refit/refit.conf, not /etc/efi/refit/refit.conf.

At the start of the ubuntu installation,you will be asked whether you want ubuntu to run along side windows (Dual boot) or run ubuntu as your sole OS. If you want to replace Windows 7 with ubuntu,I would back up all Music,pictures, and important data to an external source. As this WILL ERASE everything on your HDD.\nSecond, I would not worry about drivers. At installation, you will need internet. You can plug in an ethernet, or if you don't have an ethernet cable there is a workaround I found to be useful. At boot of the media you have ubuntu on select \"Try Ubuntu\" and try it out for a while.

The website also says \"Only for versions before 1.1.22. Run tools/make_makefiles\" before building it. I don't knowú what that means, but it might be useful.\nThankfully the first option worked for me.\nI feel it's worth noting that while adding another OS with YUMI under WINE seems to work fine, I've always had trouble setting up a fresh flash drive with YUMI under WINE, but maybe it's just me.

It gave no errors (like invalid password).\nI read something about lightdm causing this issue, so I tried to install gdm in TTY. When I tried to do this, TTY gave me an 'incorrect password (or login)' error. I am very sure my password was correct and I even tried ticking it in the command section so I could rule out changes in the keyboard layout. \nI would be very thankful if someone could help me out of this problem since I am now unable to use Ubuntu and similar questions won't solve my problem (since i can't get in TTY altogether).\nEdit: I forgot to tell that 2D login and guest login don't work either.

I used pkexec to change ownership using the terminal. I now realize that this shift in ownership may be the cause of my loginloop problem. sudo does work now, so I'll try some other commands. I would be thankful if someone can offer me help on this matter!\n\nA: I had a similar problem running Kubuntu 12.04 for a long time: The login screen appeared as normal, but logging in would not take me to a plasma desktop, but rather back to the login screen. I assume the problem works about the same way for Ubuntu with gdm as it did for me using kdm.\nAs a temporary solution, I was able to get to a proper desktop environment by entering:\nsudo service kdm stop\nstartx\n\nfrom a tty console, which I escaped to with ctrl+alt+f3 from the login screen.\nSuspecting a permissions issue with .Xauthority and or my /tmp/ directory (as per many other answers to this same question), I ran:\nls -la ~/.Xauthority\n\nand verified its owners were set to username username and not root root, and ran\nls -ld /tmp\n\nand ensured its permissions read as drwxrwxrwt. I also tried removing the .Xauthority file altogether, hoping it would be regenerated properly upon next login, but this didn't work for me (others seem to have had success trying this, however).\nNext I checked my ~/.profile for extraneous lines, and read through my .xsession-errors file for clues to no avail.\nWhat eventually worked for me was removing  my ~/.dmrc file.\nFrom https://help.ubuntu.com/community/dmrcErrors:\n\n\"The .dmrc is an initialization file which the system checks during\n  session login. Specifically, gnome checks the file for any specific\n  language or session information it hasn't located elsewhere. While\n  often the file is blank except for the basic header data, it may\n  contain a specific language to use at session startup.\"\n\nThis file must have 644 permissions to work properly (EDIT: The above link actually gives a few other permissions that will work besides 644, but 644 is the explicitly given permission to set), so before removing it verify that\nls -la ~/.dmrc\n\nyields the permissions drwxr-xr-x 143 user user, and if not try using\nchmod 644 /home/username/.dmrc\n\nIf none of the above solutions worked, try backing up and removing this file with:\ncp /home/username/.dmrc /home/username/.dmrc.backup\nrm /home/username/.dmrc\n\nUpon next login, a new .dmrc file will be generated and configured correctly, and in my case I was finally able to log in properly without escaping to tty, killing kdm, and starting x manually.\nNOTE: I suspect the root cause of this came when the partition my home folder was on filled up during a session, which caused a whole slew of other issues with configuration files not being written that needed to be written. The infinite login loop problem started immediately after that, and I noticed that the .dmrc file had a size of 0, rather than containing:\n[Desktop]\nSession=default\n\nas it does now in the fully functioning condition. It seems from the above quote that this file is read on login, and maybe my login loop occurred because Kubuntu didn't know how to handle an empty .dmrc file, but I'm only speculating.\n\nA: The answer on this (similar) question solved my problem: Ubuntu gets stuck in a login loop.

I'd like to know a foolproof way of setting everything up.\nNow, the only place I could find the erase block size of the 840 is here:\nhttp://thessdreview.com/Forums/ssd-beginners-guide-discussion/3630.htm\nI simply can't understand why such information isn't made freely accessible by manufacturers! But, anyway, this would suggest the EBS is 1536kb, which seems odd to me.\nIt is to my understanding that you should now align by MiB (usually set at 1MiB). I assume that the figure above should actually be 1536k B=1.5MiB? This seems to suggest the partition alignment will be somewhat non-standard.\nSo my question is: How do I align my partitions given this information? Please bear in mind that I have never used linux before; I'm doing my best to get everything set up so that I can begin to learn but am finding this process incredibly opaque and time consuming. If possible, a step by step guide through GParted would be great; at the moment I'm considering an NTFS partition ~20GB for Windows (playing games), an EXT4 ~20GB for ubuntu (for doing everything else) and a shared documents+games partition for everything else in NTFS file format. I'm not going to have any swap partition and use swap files instead.\n\nA: Assuming the figure of 1536kB (1.5MiB) is correct, you'll need to either use some manual alignment options in your partitioning software (GParted, parted, gdisk, etc.) or align on a multiple of both 1MiB (the default with most modern software) and 1.5MiB. Since 3MiB is the minimum value that satisfies both constraints, that's what you should use.\nYou're right that 1.5MiB is a bizarre value. It's such an odd value, in fact, that I'm a bit suspicious of it, and I'd err on the size of caution by aligning on a 3MiB boundary, or maybe even 6MiB (just in case the true value is 2MiB).\nTo do this, you need to understand your partitioning software's options. In GParted, you can't set alignment to an arbitrary value, just to none, cylinder, or MiB. Unfortunately, the user interface, although GUI, is a bit unclear:\n\nYou'd need to set the space via the \"Free Space Preceding\" box; but that's the free space between the new partition and the one before it, and where that one ends is unknown -- at least, not from the Create New Partition dialog box. The text-mode parted utility has similar problems.\nIf your disk should use GPT, I recommend that you use gdisk instead. (If you're booting in BIOS mode and want to use MBR, fdisk gives you more flexibility, but it still can't be set to use arbitrary alignment values, so you'll need to specify you partition start values manually.) You'll have a hard time installing gdisk in the Ubuntu installer, so it's easier to use System Rescue CD or Parted Magic to do the work. You can change the alignment by typing x to enter the experts' menu, using the l (or L) option to set the alignment (which you specify in sectors), and then using 'm' to return to the main menu, from which you can create partitions. It looks something like this:\n$ sudo gdisk /dev/sdd\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.6\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.\n\nCommand (? for help): x\n\nExpert command (? for help): L\nEnter the sector alignment value (1-65536, default = 2048): 6144\n\nExpert command (? for help): m\n\nCommand (? for help): n\nPartition number (2-128, default 2): \nFirst sector (34-30297182, default = 6144) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: \nLast sector (6144-30297182, default = 30297182) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: \nCurrent type is 'Linux filesystem'\nHex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): \nChanged type of partition to 'Linux filesystem'\n\nCommand (? for help): p\nDisk /dev/sdd: 30297216 sectors, 14.4 GiB\nLogical sector size: 512 bytes\nDisk identifier (GUID): 2E980CFA-8BD4-4D53-BABC-CCEFEFB6B2EF\nPartition table holds up to 128 entries\nFirst usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 30297182\nPartitions will be aligned on 6144-sector boundaries\nTotal free space is 1566 sectors (783.0 KiB)\n\nNumber  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name\n   1             264            4807   2.2 MiB     EF00  EFI System\n   2            6144        30297182   14.4 GiB    8300  Linux filesystem\n\nCommand (? for help): w\n\nFinal checks complete.

So I'll summarize it here (and post a final question).\nThere are three kind of Broadcomm wifi drivers that apply to this situation (taken from here):\nDriver                         Description                                                           \nbroadcom-wl              Proprietary Broadcom STA driver                          \nb43                             Reversed engineered (open source) kernel driver\nbrcmsmac/brcmfmacOpen source Broadcomm kernel driver                 \nSo, apparently, Ubuntu came pre-installed with broadcom-wl enabled. As this Kernel spec page says, the b43 is not an option (it says \"No (WIP)\") for my hardware ID 14e4:4727, and the alternatives are wl and brcm80211 (the latter got renamed to brcmsmac). So then simply removing the package of the proprietary driver will make the brcmsmac start working (without installing any additional package because, as it is open source, this driver is embedded in the kernel):\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\nAfter rebooting and deleting my previous network-profiles saved in NetworkManager, this started working.\nSo, now the question is, how to fix this upstream so Ubuntu 13.10 comes without the proprietary driver package installed in case it finds this hardware?\n", "Q: My HP Pavilion DV6 laptop overheats on ubuntu but not on win7 HP Pavilion DV6 1256TX gets hotter while running ubuntu 13.04 than on win 7..\nI am kind of new on ubuntu..\nI tried many methods mentioned on different forums but none could not get it correct.. :/\n\nA: *\n\n*Run the command sudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.backup\n\n*Run the command gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Make sure you do not see noacpi (set it to acpi or delete it, depending on where it is), pci=noacpi (set it to pci=acpi), or acpi=off (set it to acpi=on)\n\n*Reboot and see if it helps.\n\n\nBasically, you set Ubuntu to use acpi to control the hardware, which generally fixes overheating.

I recently upgraded to 12.10, and so reverted to Nouveau graphics drivers.  This led to serious 3D rendering problems, so I switched to using nVidia drivers as per https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro7-1/Quantal#Video.2BAC8-Graphic_Card.  Unfortunately that didn't go well, leading to an unbootable system after enabling the driver (it got through the Plymouth splash, screen went to black and system was entirely unresponsive).  Reverted to Nouveau drivers by booting into recovery shell, remounting the filesystem and using jockey-text --no-dbus to disable the driver.  Back to square 1.\nI then tried the other available nvidia_current option from the restricted drivers menu (included VPDAU and some other bits, I can't remember exactly what) and rebooted.  Once again problems, but different ones.  Instead of booting to a graphic login prompt, I get dumped to tty1.  tty7 meanwhile is churning away some sort of log, which always ends at apache starting, preceded by LightDM starting.  Relevant lines from the end of dmesg seem to be\ninit: lightdm main process terminated with status 1\n...\ninit: failsafe-x main process terminated with status 1\n\nAnnoyingly, I can't revert to nouveau drivers as running jockey-text -l from a tty doesn't show the driver I selected, and all shown graphics drivers are shown as disabled.\nIt looks related to this bug, I've had all the symptoms listed there running with the nouveau driver (especially the random temporary freezes) since upgrading, and the random mess on the Plymouth screens even under 12.04.  Unfortunately that bug seems to have received no attention at all.\nI'm up for any methods to either get back to the nouveau driver which at least lets me use the system, or get a working nVidia driver (which would of course be ideal).  Any suggestions?\n\nA: Here are some instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode\n\n*Open a Terminal\n\n*Run the following commands:\n\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\necho 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nThis will remove the Nvidia drivers and revert to the nouveau ones.

When I am trying to install ubuntu in my laptop it is showing that \"there is no operating system found in your system do you want to install ?  the whole data will be lost.\" But I am already using WINDOWS 7. It is not showing the option along with WINDOWS 7. Please give me the solution.\n\nA: Follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into BIOS\n\n*Set the SATA mode to IDE\n\n*Set the SATA3 mode to AHCI\n\n*Install. You will need to change these settings back when you boot into Windows and vice versa, as Windows cannot boot with these settings.\n\n*It is likely the bootloader will not show up, but that can be fixed easily by first typing sudo fdisk -l in a Terminal\n\n*Then, run sudo mount /dev/STEP_5_OUTPUT /mnt && sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda\nNow you should be able to boot, but be sure to revert the changes to BIOS to boot Windows and vice versa\n\nA: Most of the time this happens when you didn't install the bootloader in the correct place during installation or somehow the MBC got corrupted. If you really want to access windows 7 again insert your windows 7 recovery disc.

David Planella wrote in his answer to a question I posted that: \n\n...the recommended way to develop apps for Ubuntu is the Ubuntu SDK.\n\nSo I installed it, but looks like the supported programming language is C++. Does it mean I will need to know C++ to develop a new application for Ubuntu?

The Ubuntu project is tightly focused on getting a stable mobile phone OS by October 2013, and a full convergent story by Ubuntu 14.04. In order to achieve this, QML has been the language of choice to recommend to app developers to write their software.\nTechnically, provided that there are Qt/QML bindings in Python available, it should be possible to use it with the SDK. However, given the time frames, we want to focus on supporting one toolkit and doing it well, rather than supporting multiple options.\nIf any community members are interested in contributing towards it, it should not be an impossible task, but right now the status of Python Qt bindings is a bit complicated: PySide, which would be the natural choice, will not be ported to Qt5 in the foreseeable future. PyQt has just been ported to Qt5, but it might not be the best choice in terms of licensing commercial applications, which will coexist with free, open source apps in the ecosystem. See more context on this earlier question.\n\nA: Python and Ubuntu are inseperable, any device running Ubuntu will definitely have python running now and in the future, whether this is desktop or mobile.

It is launched from a \".desktop\" file so the user never sees the terminal. It looks 100% like a GUI app (even though it is just a bash script). It runs in KDE only (Kubuntu 12.04).\nMy only problem is handling password input securely and conveniently. I can't find a satisfactory solution.\nThe script was designed to be run as a normal user and to prompt for the password when a sudo command is first needed. In this way, most commands, those not requiring sudo rights, are run as the normal user. What happens (when the script is run from the terminal) is that the user is prompted for their password once and the default sudo timeout allows the script to finish, including any additional sudo commands, without prompting the user again. This is how I want it to work when run behind the GUI too.\nThe main problem is that using kdesudo to launch my script, which is the standard GUI way, means that the entire script is executed by the root user. So file ownerships get assigned to the root user, I can't rely upon ~/ in paths, and many other things are less than ideal. Running the entire script as the root user is just a very unsatisfactory solution and I think it is a bad practice.\nI appreciate any ideas for letting a user enter the sudo password just once via GUI while not running the whole script as root. Thanks.\n\nA: The -A sudo option allows you to specify a helper program (in the SUDO_ASKPASS variable) that will ask for the password.\nCreate a script to ask the password (myaskpass.sh):\n#!/bin/bash\nzenity --password --title=Authentication\n\nThen insert this line at the beginning of your script:\nexport SUDO_ASKPASS=\"/path/to/myaskpass.sh\"\n\nand replace all occurences of sudo <command> with:\nsudo -A <command>\n\nYou can use whatever password asking program you want instead of zenity. I had to encapsulate it within a script because SUDO_ASKPASS must point to a file, so it won't work with the --password option required by zenity.\nThe above works like a charm if it runs from command line or if you choose Run in terminal after double click the script file in the file manager, but if you choose Run or try to launch it from a .desktop file every sudo will ask for the for password again.\n\nIf you don't want a terminal window at all, you can store the password in a variable and pipe it to sudo -S. Maybe there's some security concerns, but I think it's pretty safe (read the comments on this answer).\nInsert this line at the beginning of your script:\nPASSWD=\"$(zenity --password --title=Authentication)\\n\"\n\nand replace all occurences of sudo <command> with:\necho -e $PASSWD | sudo -S <command>\n\n\nA: This is based on Eric Carvalho's excellent answer. I am posting it to elaborate on the problem I encountered. Specifically, when using this the usual sudo timeout (e.g., 15 minutes) is lost. My script, which has over 50 sudo commands now prompts for the user's password 50+ times!\nHere are full working example of all parts of the solution. It consists of a bash script, a \"myaskpass\" script as Eric suggested, and a \".desktop\" file. The whole things should be 100% GUI (no terminal interaction at all), so the .desktop file is essential (afaik).\n$ cat myaskpass.sh \n#!/bin/bash\nkdialog --password \"Please enter your password: \"\nexit 0\n\n\n$ cat askpasstest1.desktop \n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nComment=SUDO_ASKPASS tester1\nExec=bash /home/user/test/askpasstest1.sh\nGenericName=SUDO_ASKPASS tester1\nName=SUDO_ASKPASS tester1\nNoDisplay=false\nPath[$e]=\nStartupNotify=true\nTerminal=false\nTerminalOptions=\nType=Application\nCategories=Application;Utility;\nX-KDE-SubstituteUID=false\nX-KDE-Username=\n\nAnd a test script itself. This one will ask for your password twice when using this solution. (Normally, it would ask only once due to the default sudo timeout.)\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo -k\nSUDO_ASKPASS=\"/home/user/test/myaskpass.sh\" sudo -A touch filemadeas_askpass1\ntouch filemadeas_regularuser1\nSUDO_ASKPASS=\"/home/user/test/myaskpass.sh\" sudo -A touch filemadeas_askpass2\ntouch filemadeas_regularuser2\nls -la filemadeas* > /home/user/test/fma.log\nkdialog --title \"Files Created\" --textbox /home/user/test/fma.log 640 480\nsudo rm filemadeas_*\nrm fma.log\n\nexit 0\n\n\nA: The following script works via command line, desktop file or double-click, asks for the password only once, and the command pattern sudo -Sp '' <your command here> <<<${sudo_password} can be used multiple times anywhere in the file: \n    # get sudo password\n    sudo_password=$( gksudo --print-pass --message=\"Provide permission to make system changes: Type your password or press Cancel.\" -- : 2>/dev/null )\n    # check for null entry or cancellation\n    if [[ ${?} != 0 || -z ${sudo_password} ]]\n    then\n        exit 4\n    fi\n    if ! sudo -kSp '' [ 1 ] <<<${sudo_password} 2>/dev/null\n    then\n        exit 4\n    fi\n    # command\n    sudo -Sp '' gedit \"/etc/hosts\" <<<${sudo_password}\n\n", "Q: How to replace EasyPeasy partition with Lubuntu I have acer netbook with dual boot, window 7 and Easy Peasy .

You can check with the manufacturer's website, and download their testing software, and test the drive with it.\nIn my personal opinion, I would get a backup of the drive as soon as possible, and keep using it until it dies.  However, I would definitely keep an eye on both the Reallocation Event Count and the Reallocated Sector Count. \nThe event count indicates the number of times the drive tried, and the sector count indicates the number of sectors actually moved to a spare area on the drive. If it stays stable, it's a one-time thing that's not the biggest of problems. If it gets worse, replace the drive.\n\nReallocation Event Count S.M.A.R.T. parameter indicates a count of remap operations (transferring data from a bad sector to a special\n  reserved disk area - spare area).\nThe raw value of this attribute shows the total number of attempts to\n  transfer data from reallocated sectors to a spare area. Unsuccessful\n  attempts are counted as well as successful. Since this is a count\n  value, it can only increase.\nRecommendations\nThis is a critical parameter. Degradation of this parameter may\n  indicate imminent drive failure. Urgent data backup and hardware\n  replacement is recommended.\n\nSource:Acronis\n", "Q: I cannot enable canonical partner and independent, why? On Software and Updates under Other Software tab, I want to enable Canonical Partner and Independent, after I clicked the checkbox and input my password, the checkbox stay unchecked no matter how many times I try to click it, why?\nI'm on Raring.\n\nA: The bug is Ubuntu failing to display an authentication prompt. A potential solution to this is simply to run the software as root:\nsudo software-properties-gtk\n\nIt's also possible (as @Abdel-Rahman notes) to edit the sources.list file directly. The software-properties-gtk application does just edit that file, commenting or uncommenting the line as needed. Using add-apt-repository will duplicate this line, and have no effect on the authentication bug: it's not actively harmful, but it's not a preferable solution.\n\nA: The accepted solution works fine alternatively you can navigate to and edit sources.list file directly from terminal using\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nfind the line that says\n#deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu bionic partner\n\nremove the comment and save(Ctrl+X), and you're done.  \n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner\"\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring main\"\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen go back to Software and Updates, and check to see if its OK\nNote: in the second command replace raring with your Ubuntu version.\n", "Q: software centre cant find the internet I am running ubuntu 11.04 on vmware. I can access the internet fine with firefox but the Software Centre cant download anything and tells me to check my internet connection. \nUsing apt-get on the command line gives me errors like...\nFailed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty-security/multiverse/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.176 80]\n\nSynaptic also reports similar problems.\nAny ideas what is going wrong?\n\nA: To install updates, you need to have a supported version of Ubuntu. 11.04 is no longer supported, so you cannot update it. You need to upgrade your installation to fix this. Just start a Terminal session and type sudo do-release-upgrade to upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Acer C-7 Chrome Book I am running 12.04 Chrubutu and I like it.
