["Q: How to install SiS 771/671 video drivers on 13.10? I've been trying for sometime to install SiS 771/671 PCIE drivers and couldn't find any info. Sis web page doesn't have a specific driver for this board, I has drivers only for Sis 650/740 and 630/730 boards and Redhat only. \nAnyone has any idea on how I install these drivers ?\nThanks :)\n\nA: \nNOTE: This answer does not work anymore for versions of Ubuntu after 14.10.\n\nThe display driver for sis would be already installed in Ubuntu\nxserver-xorg-video-sis is the display driver for all Sis and XGI video driver.\nTo check if this is installed or not you can execute this command:\nsudo dpkg -l | grep xserver-xorg-video-sis\n\nIf it doesn't list any value then you can install it by:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-sis\n\nYou can find more about the SIS display driver at X.org site.\nSource: X.org Foundation\nIn addition to this this link would help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/sis\n", "Q: Asus G75VX / Xubuntu 13.10 EFI installation Blank Screen I am trying to install Xubuntu 13.10 on a G75VX laptop which has Windows 8 Pre-Installed. So my installation has to be in EFI mode. I've had Xubuntu 13.10 installed in it for a while on a different hard drive and it worked just fine. When i try to install in EFI mode it boots but I get a blank screen after booting. Adding nomodeset to grub like I've done to install in legacy mode will not resolve the issue.\nThis installation will have the following:\nEFI boot.Cannot install Legacy mode due to Pre-installed Windows 8\nUbuntu will be installed on a secondary HDD by itself Along with Windows 8 on Primary HDD.\nNvidia Graphics GTX670MX.\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Can you boot the installer in legacy (aka CSM or BIOS) mode? If you can, then you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n*In Windows, install my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Edit the refind.conf file: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the options.\n\n\nThe result should be that rEFInd will appear when you reboot, and it will give you at least two boot options: One for Windows and one with a gray diamond icon that will boot to the BIOS-mode GRUB, and from there to Linux. You can also add an EFI filesystem driver for ext4fs (or whatever filesystem holds your Linux kernel) to experiment with direct EFI-mode booting. If you can eventually get this to work (because of kernel upgrades or whatever special kernel options overcome the problem), you can switch to a direct EFI-mode boot of Linux.\n", "Q: list.save and list.distUpgrade This is more of a curiosity question as I try to get a better understanding of apt and package management. \nI'm seeing that in my /etc/apt/ and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ folders I have very or sometimes identical files which have the extension of sources.list, sources.list.distUpgrade, sources.list.save, and so on. \nWhat's the point of these duplicate or similar files? \nsources.list and sources.list.save in /etc/apt/ seem to be identical but sources.list.distUpgrade shows quantal instead of raring for most stuff (I probably first installed quantal). \nOn the other hand, in the case of google-talkplugin.list and google-talkplugin.listUpgrade in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ the content of the files seems to be completely identical.\nDidn't find much in Google searches. I reviewed the sources.list manpage but it didn't talk much about it. \nAlso noticed this article where a bug related to the extensions was noted for 10.10 \n\nA: I am not sure about sources.list.distUpgrade, but the sources.list.save file is a backup of the sources.list file.  I know from personal experience (about 5 minutes ago) that the sources.list.save file is extremely important after attempting to add a repository.  If  software center stops working correctly (EX: closing right after starting) then you need to replace the current sources.list file with the sources.list.save file.\nTo do this, open a new terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and type the command\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list.save /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nand then\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThis should fix the corrupt sources.list as long as sources.list.save exists in the /etc/apt/ directory.\nSimply put, sources.list.save is just a backup file.\n\nA: I was concerned about whether these files are included in the repos used when updating etc packages. It seems they're not: From man sources.list re. the sources.list.d directory:\n\nFilenames need to have either the extension .list or .sources depending on the contained format.\n\nit goes on to talk about ignoring files. In summary I take it to mean that only files with .list or .sources get used when updating packages etc. The meaning of the .save and .distUpgrade files is well explained in the existing answer from Strato1 and the comments there.\n", "Q: Can not connect to internet in 13.10 I just upgraded to ubuntu 13.10 from 13.04.

This helped to fix my inability to right-click with the right button of the touchpad:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/61958...rking-in-linux\nNow my biggest problem is that I have to really bang on the touchpad to make it click. I don't mean the buttons but the touchpad area itself is not sensitive AT ALL in spite of having the sensitivity cranked up in the system tools/mouse and touchpad.\nAlso sometimes even when I bang on it hard, it is only the second or third click that is recognized, not the first. This makes the click feature of the touchpad almost worthless.\nI have the speed and acceleration turned all the way up but I would like the cursor to move faster, accelerate faster, and move more with each swipe on the touchpad since I have a big screen to cover (17inch).\nAny ideas? Also the touchpad does not completely turn off while typing. Or it doesn't turn off long enough. The cursor wobbles all over as I type.\nSo, yeah, this touchpad is a nightmare with the G750 in Ubuntu.\nAnother thing is the video card. When I scroll, I see a wonky line in the middle of the screen, going horizontally. I tried using the built-in method to update the video driver, but it didn't help even though it installed the driver.\nI should mention too that using the touchpad I can't select multiple files in a series using either shift-click or ctrl-click. This is really frustrating! \nAny help for these problems would be much, much appreciated. \n", "Q: Command to view containing folder of an application in Ubuntu Which command is used to view containing folder of an application?

At one stage it asked me about gnome something and if I wanted the defaults or to keep what I had.

I can tell this by moving the cursor from one screen to the other - it goes off the right edge of the right screen and lands on the left edge of the left screen.\nWhen the system comes up I can see that it is still wrong because the left one is 1920x1080 and the right is 1680x1050 and the left image comes over to 1680 instead of 1920. If I move the cursor to the right edge suddenly it straightens itself out.\nTwo questions: 1) if I can somehow ask for the default values of the gnome - if that is a possible problem. 2) if I can set up proper values for the screen positions at boot time?\nThanks,\nIlan\n\nA: You are probably talking about /etc/gnome/defaults.list which has nothing to do with monitors as far as I know.\nYou should be able to find /etc/gnome/defaults.list.dpkg-old or /etc/gnome/defaults.list.dpkg-new depending on which file you choose to install during upgrade.\nYou can also search for the package that contains the particular file:\n$ dpkg  --search /etc/gnome/defaults.list\ndesktop-file-utils: /etc/gnome/defaults.list\n\nReinstalling should also work:\n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall desktop-file-utils\n\nHow can I restore configuration files?\nAs always, it's important that you know the exact error message.

They are similar: the same package (also called apt) provides both, and everything apt can do, the traditional apt- utilities can too, though in some cases you would have to pass special configuration options. But apt is closer than apt-get to the Software Updater. Like the Software Updater, sudo apt upgrade is capable of installing new packages when the new version of an existing package declares them as dependencies.\nSo these days, users who are concerned with this distinction can just run sudo apt upgrade instead of sudo apt-get upgrade if they want new dependencies to be installed automatically. Consequently, the Software Updater's feature of delaying some updates slightly, to determine if they are stable in the wild and limit damage if they are not, is now probably the main difference between using the Software Updater and updating on the command-line.\nThis behavior of the Software Updater is due to the phased updates policy. That policy--implemented in the Software Updater but not in apt-get (or apt)--has been one major difference between the two methods ever since the policy was introduced, and pabouk commented about it a couple years ago:\n\nThere is another difference: apt-get does not use PhasedUpdates so sometimes Software Updater shows less updates than apt-get. See Why Does Software Updater Say No updates Available, but apt-get upgrade Shows updates available?.\n\n– pabouk Feb 25 '15 at 7:34\nThis may always have been the most significant difference, in that one could always run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade when faced with the upgrade action's unwillingness to install new packages or uninstall existing ones. However, when updating from the command-line, the relative importance of phased updates increases with apt:\n\n*\n\n*Like apt-get, the apt command will download and install updates even if they would be delayed due to the phased updates policy if the Software Updater had been used instead.\n\n*But unlike apt-get, the apt command's upgrade action will install new packages that were not previously installed but are required as dependencies for new package versions.\n\nAside from (a) preferring a graphical interface and (b) its desktop integration providing notifications when updates are available, the main current reason one might use the Software Updater that it is the easiest way to participate in phased updates.\n\nA: Short answer\nNo, they are not the same. apt-get upgrade doesn't handle changing dependencies between versions, so if a package has changed dependencies, it wont be upgraded (it'll be \"held back\"). See the long answer for more details.\nUsing the Software Updater and using sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (note the dist-) would be almost equivalent, except that one's obviously a GUI and the other's a console application and also a few very minor informational differences.\n\nLong asnwer\nFrom man apt-get,\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get upgrade:\nupgrade\n           upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages\n           currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in\n           /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new\n           versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no\n           circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages\n           not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of\n           currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without\n           changing the install status of another package will be left at\n           their current version. An update must be performed first so that\n           apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n(emphasis by me)\nThis means that a newer version of a package which has a new dependency not required in the old version will not be upgraded with this method (unless the new dependency was already installed). These will be shown as \"Held back\".\n\n*apt-get dist-upgrade:\ndist-upgrade\n       dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\n       also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\n       of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and\n       it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the\n       expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade\n       command may therefore remove some packages. The\n       /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which\n       to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for\n       a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual\n       packages.\n(emphasis by me)\nThis means that with this command instead of upgrade, packages with new (or removed) dependencies can by upgraded.\nExample\nA good example of the difference between the two is when a new Linux kernel is released. This is packaged into the linux-image-generic package which always depends on the latest package of the Linux kernel. Because the dependencies of linux-image-generic change with each kernel upgrade, upgrade wont upgrade it.\n", "Q: No sound with Philips SAA7130 Hybrid Capture Device card I have put a Philips SAA7130 Hybrid Capture Device card in a PCI slot.

How can I switch it back?\n\nA: I found the answer to my question in CCSM. The following screenshot shows the related page. You can reach it under Expo settings. At the bottom of the image, the combo box named Multi Output Mode is what I needed. Changing it from One wall per output to One big wall did it.\n\n\nA: For 14.04, You can find \"Desktop Wall\" in CCSM. There is a tab \"Viewport Switching\" and there is an option called \"Multimonitor behavior\", you should change it to \"Switch seperately\"[1]\n[1] http://i.imgur.com/hQTvk9H.png\n\nA: 13.10, Desktop-AMD64 Saucy Salamander has the Workspace utility switched off by default.  Install \"Unity Tweak Tool\", launch the application and click on \"Workspace Settings\".\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/07/change-number-of-workspaces-ubuntu/\n", "Q: How to enable log in administrator password? I have enabled my administrative password but when I start my computer and just click on administrator it login in without asking for a password. I want it to be that whenever I start my computer it asks me for password (for the administrator account) before logging in.\n\nA: To get started, go to Ubuntu Options at the top right corner and select ‘System Settings..’\n\nNext, click on ‘User Accounts’ to continue.\n\nThen unlock the settings to make changes. Only an administrator or root user can unlock.\n\nAfter unlocking , change the ‘Automatic Login’ to OFF\n\nOr your can just run the commands below to open lightdm.conf file.\nsudo -i gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\n\nThen remove the line as highlighted below and save the file. \n\nSource...\n", "Q: How to prevent the Power button to shutdown directly the system? I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10. When I press my power button, my computer immediately shuts down. In Ubuntu 13.04 I got a nice menu, where I could choose what to do. It is gone now and I want it back. Here is my /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh in pastebin.\nI already did\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-WORD 'interactive'\n\nwhere WORD is hibernate, power, sleep and suspend.\n\nA: Check your /etc/systemd/logind.conf file. It should look like this:\n[Login]\n#NAutoVTs=6\n#ReserveVT=6\n#KillUserProcesses=no\n#KillOnlyUsers=\n#KillExcludeUsers=root\n#Controllers=\n#ResetControllers=cpu\n#InhibitDelayMaxSec=5\n#HandlePowerKey=poweroff\n#HandleSuspendKey=suspend\n#HandleHibernateKey=hibernate\n#HandleLidSwitch=suspend\n#PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=no\n#SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=no\n#HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=no\n#LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=yes\n#IdleAction=ignore\n#IdleActionSec=30min\n\nUncomment the line that says #HandlePowerKey=poweroff and change the value to ignore.\nThen restart the logind with the command: sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind or reboot your computer.\nEDIT: how to create a new acpi handler\nCreate a new file in /etc/acpi/events/. The content of the file should be:\nevent=<acpi_event_code>\naction=<script_to_call>\n\nwhere <acpi_event_code> is the code you get using the acpi_listen tool and <script_to_call> is the full path to the script you wish to call when that event happens.\nThey must have changed something in 13.10 because it seems that I have too few files in my /etc/accpi/events folder compared to the 13.04.\n\nA: jeremijah put me on the right track so kudos!\nI edited /etc/systemd/logind.conf as recommended, but I also did this.\n\nA: If the above solutions don't work for you,\nHere is a quick work around:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xtrlock\n\n\nThis utility does the work for you. Though this may not answer the question,\nin the many solutions I'v tried (including the ones on this page) none seem to work \nTo install:\nsudo apt install xtrlock \n\nTo use:\nType xtrlock in the command line. This will freeze mouse, keyboard \nTo unlock type your password and press [Enter]\n\nIt can also freeze your power button.\nP.S This solution is particularly useful for those who have kids and want the power button disabled for that reason. \n\nxtrlock  -  Lock  X  display  until  password supplied, leaving\n  windows\n         visible\n  Source: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/artful/man1/xtrlock.1x.html\n\n\nA: First you could edit your keymap file to change the behavior of the power button to assign it to an other key \nEdit the file : /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet (edit POWR key)\nThen you will need to disable the power button efficiently a good method is with xinput \nrun xinput --list power buttons have their own entry... pick the device number then run \nxinput disable devnumber something like xinput disable 8\n", "Q: Not able to install PHP5-dev in 13.04 I'm trying to run phpize in ubuntu.

Although, that package scheme changed and now Teamviewer distribute the native build for both i386 and amd64 architecture, as they don't need anymore multiarch.\nSimply downloading the appropriated package for Debian/Ubuntu and installing it using your favorite method, should be enough. This package also installs a repository, so it should also automatically upgrade itself when you upgrade your system.\n\nA: To install on Ubuntu 20.04 x64, from https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-teamviewer-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install gdebi-core wget\nwget -O ~/teamviewer.deb \"https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer_amd64.deb\"\nsudo gdebi ~/teamviewer.deb \nteamviewer\n\n\nA: All I had to do to amend this problem was do dpkg --force-all -i *.deb to install that package. Note that the only dependency it couldn't resolve was libpng12-0, so after forcing the install it has no images in the interface but it is still runnable. The other solutions did not solve the problem for me. I'm hoping the Teamviewer developers will get to this soon.\n\nA: With Teamviewer 15 on Ubuntu 20.04:\nDownload and install with\nsudo dpkg -i teamviewer_15.16.8_amd64.deb   # adapt to your downloaded file name\n\nThis will show dependency errors, but all you have to do to fix them is\nsudo apt --fix-broken install\n\n\nA: You need to install all dependency libraries for i386 (this might work with 64 too) as described above.\nFor the missing libpng12 library just go to: https://packages.debian.org/jessie/i386/libpng12-0/download\nand install with\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/libpng12-0_1.2.50-2+deb8u3_i386.deb\n\nit has no dependencies which wouldn't be resolved by current environemnt:\ndep: libc6 (>= 2.14), zlib1g    (>= 1:1.1.4)\n\nA: TeamViewer for Linux\nTeamViewer 14.0 is out for Linux and it's no longer based on Wine.

These files have a .run extension and were downloaded straight from the manufacturers.\nI have tried chmod +x, chmod a+x, etc and no result.\nAnother thing to note is that my QT .run file executed and installed successfully. Anybody else facing this problem.\nI am not new to linux, but still have no idea why this is happening. Could it be that since 13.10 has no ia32-libs since its multiarch? The MPLAB product website says to have ia32-libs installed. I did it for previous ubuntu versions, but since the package itself is absent, any other solution to get the installer to work?\nEDIT: Never mind that. Instead of the package ia32-libs, you now have \"lib32z1\". Simply install that and you should be able to install the package.\nHope this helps everyone.\nsudo apt-get install lib32z1\n\n\nA: \n64-bit versions of Ubuntu and its derivatives do not include the 32-bit libraries required to run the installer. This may be true of other 64-bit distributions. Before the installer will run, you need to install the ia32-libs.\n\nhttp://microchip.wikidot.com/mplab:linux64  :\nMany recent versions of 64-bit Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Xubuntu and other derivatives do not have the 32-bit libraries needed by Microchip's installers to run. Although the applications (MPLAB X IDE, MPLAB XC Compilers) are 64-bit applications, the installers are not. If you try to run an installer without the 32-bit libraries, nothing will happen at all.\nTo install the libraries, you can try the minimal installation:\nsudo apt-get install libc6:i386\n\nIf the above doesn't work, you can install the full libraries (texted on Xubuntu 12.04):\n\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nThe full libraries take some time to install, but may prove useful if you install other programs from binaries too.\n", "Q: Reading a file line by line I have a file that looks like:\n@ATDGGSGDTSG\nNTCCCCC\n+\nnddhdhnadn\n@ATDGGSGDTSG\nNTCCCCC\n+\nnddhdhnadn\n\nNow its a repeating pattern of \"4\" lines and I every time want to print only the 2nd line i.e. the line after the line starting with \"@\" i.e 2nd line..6th line..etc.\nHow can I do it?\n\nA: There are many possible solutions to the problem.

Don't forget to accept this answer.\n\nA: ansidev, are you even aware of the what the global menu is, or even what gnome is as of now? To answer the question, it is perfectly normal for Google Chrome to not have global menu integration. It's plain and simple- not supported. Firefox has global menu integration, BTW! As for the terminal, are you using the default gnome terminal or something else? Global menu integration depends from application to application.

You could add your internal records to this. There are two ways in which you could make this work:\n\n\n*\n\n*For your entire network: Install pdnsd (a is a good simple caching DNS server) on your server, set it up with an external DNS provider to cache through, and then point your router at your internal server's IP for DNS. All devices connected to the network will have their DNS requests passed through your internal server.\nIn my experience, this route isn't possible with Home/SME Netgear routers as they blow up if you try and set an internal IP as the DNS route. Stupid, unneccessary limitation on otherwise capable hardware.\n\n*Just your laptop: As above except you install and configure pdnsd on your laptop (it's not very heavy) and alter your home connection settings to use 127.0.0.1 for DNS.\n\nA: You actually might already be running a solution:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToZeroconf\nIf your server is named 'my-server', try this command from the machine that isn't the server:\n$ ping my-server.local\n\nIf you succeed, then you're running avahi on your machines and they're doing \"zeroconf\".\nThere may be other reasons why you want to run a local dns server, such as caching and so forth. A zeroconf approach doesn't address those needs.\n\nA: You can even use the router DNS server and add an host entry for the server and point the  primary DNS of your laptop to the router.\nDNS is basically the replacement of keeping host records on individual computers.\n", "Q: Gedit external tools plugin failed to load I had gedit configured with some plugins but after upgrading to 13.10, every time I go the gedit Plugins and try to load the external tools I get a message saying: Failed to Load.\nNot sure how to fix this.

You should then be able to boot to rEFInd, and from there into either Windows or Linux. If this works, you can install the rEFInd Debian package in Linux and it should all work normally.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair utility from a live CD. This will re-install GRUB, with any luck in a working configuration vs. the non-working configuration you got when you installed Ubuntu.\n\n\nIn both cases, it's best if you disable Secure Boot before trying. Although Ubuntu officially supports Secure Boot, there are a lot of problems with it. Also, rEFInd works with Secure Boot only if you jump through extra hoops.\nIf neither of these solutions works, post back with the URL that Boot Repair provides.

In the directory /etc/apache2/ you'll find the configuration files.

Keep in mind this is un-encrypted so someone else could snoop your traffic if they were on your local network.\n\nA: Distance and obstructions reduce the quality of a wireless link, lowering the available bandwidth. For better results move the machine that's on WiFi closer to the access point, or use a wired connection.  \nSSH encryption has a minimal overhead and will not cause a significant delay in the transfer. If you use SSH / SFTP you can enable compression, which may make the transfer complete faster because less data has to be sent. There doesn't seem to be a way to enable compression in FileZilla, but you can always use the command line client. To enable compression use the -C switch.\nsftp -C user@remote\n\n", "Q: Dual monitor, permission issue I had a dual monitor configuration going on for quite some time. One day, after moving the computer to another location and reconnecting everything, it changed such that I saw everything in double (being very much sober), I think it's called the 'mirrors' config. Anyway, from there on, there was nothing to be done through the system settings gui to change it back, as it wouldn't allow me to save any modification. The error I get when clicking 'save' is : \n\"Failed to create file /home/me/monitors.xml.xxxxxx. Permission denied\", xxxx being a random code, changing everytime.\nHowever, I can save all the configurations I want just fine by using the terminal, in my case:\n xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --right-of VGA-1\n\nSo I do have a workaround and this is therefore a question more out of curiosity.

With 'safe' I mean unrecoverable when my HDD get's mounted without knowing my personal password. The only thing encrypted (as far as I know) is my /home folder. \n\nA: Password information like this (and WiFi passwords, browser passwords, etc.) are stored encrypted in a login keyring. The login keyring is encypted using your login password, and is decrypted when you log in. \nIf someone steals your hard drive, they would need your login password to decrypt the keyring. Additionally, the keyring is stored in your home folder, so if you have your home folder encrypted, then the keyring and its data are stored double encrypted.\n\nA: Something worth mentioning is that ftp is a clear text protocol. So this password you want to keep safe on your computer is sent out to the network in clear text every time you log on to this ftp.\nSo if security is REALLY something you worry about you should use something else like sftp or perhaps ftps.\nThis  means if someone would steal your computer. They would only have to set up a new ftp   server with the same address, connect on your bookmarked ftp connection.

After upgrading to version 13.10 I can no loger get a cedilla by typing '+C. Instead, I get a \"ć\".\nWhat should I do to get a \"ç\"?\nI am using Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 64 bit.  \n\nA: There is the x11 Compose file /usr/share/X11/locale/pt_BR.UTF-8/Compose for Brazilian Portuguese with this contents:\ninclude \"/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose\"\n<dead_acute> <C>    : \"Ç\" Ccedilla # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n<dead_acute> <c>    : \"ç\" ccedilla # LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n\nSo, whichever language you are using, all you need to do, to make '+c result in ç, is:\n\n*\n\n*Generate the pt_BR.UTF-8 locale, if it's not already available:\nsudo locale-gen pt_BR.UTF-8\n\n\n*Add this line to your ~/.profile file:\nexport LC_CTYPE=pt_BR.UTF-8\nIf you are a Brazilian user, and install the Portuguese language - either when installing or later from Language Support - you can skip the just mentioned steps. Instead you can just open Language Support and select Brazilian Portuguese as the display language. As from Ubuntu 15.04 it's sufficient to select Brazilian Portuguese as the Regional Formats setting.\nEdit:\nAnd a third way, if you don't want to change the LC_CTYPE variable, is to create an ~/.XCompose file and give it this contents:\n<dead_acute> <C> : \"Ç\" Ccedilla # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n<dead_acute> <c> : \"ç\" ccedilla # LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n\n\nA: The layout you need is the \"English (International with AltGr dead keys)\"\n\npressing AltGr + , brings the ç. AltGr + Shift + , brings Ç\n\nA: A per user configuration for the combination ' + c = ç can be achieved by adding:\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=cedilla\n\nto the user's .profile file.\n\nA: In case a future visitor with a German keyboard layout winds up here, like me – even though it is outside the scope of the original question:\n\n\n*\n\n*ç is entered Alt Gr+´, c\n\n*Ç is entered Alt Gr+´, C\n\nA: Append the line below to the file /etc/environment and do the login again.\n\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=cedilla\n\n\nA: With Xubuntu 16.04 and generic international 105-key layout (UK English variant), I can get a cedilla on many characters by hitting AltGr+=, followed by the character I want to \"decorate\", i.e. c or Shift+c.\nA similar sort of \"decoration prefix\" can be done with AltGr+X where X is ;, ', or # for acute, circumflex, and grave respectively. And there are more, e.g. the [ and ] keys. These are the default characters on these keys in the UK layout -- other layouts might differ but I suspect all the relevant decorator keys are on the right-hand side of the keyboard near the Enter key.\n\nA: In 13.10 and above you can use right Alt+ , (i.e. right Alt + comma) in English (US International with dead keys) to get ç. Shift + Right Alt + comma = Ç\nRight Alt + is useful for ¡¿áéúóí also.\n\nA: It seems that just the step 3, proposed by Alexandre Schmidt (another answer to this same question), is enough to make the cedilla work, although the meaning of steps 1 and 2 is unknown for me at this time. I tested just this third step with success, as proposed by Jose Vitor Lopes at Comment 42 for bug 518056.\nFor more details about this issue, check the entire log at Launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/518056).\n\nadd one line in /etc/environment\nGTK_IM_MODULE=cedilla\n     QT_IM_MODULE=cedilla\nRestart your computer\n\n\nSource\nThe limitation of this change is that other consonants such as \"S\" are still being accentuated as \"Ś\", instead of having an apostrophe before the letter, as on \"'S\", used to express contractions.\n16.04 LTS (Unity) update: config file changes are not needed anymore.

Is there a program/application available that can search for the right domain name and write it to the resolv.conf file? \nThe reason why I would like to have the correct domain name in the \"domain\" field is that I want to install a program that needs the host name of the computer. During the installation procedure I get the message \"could not successfully ping hostname.old-domain-name\". Obviously this does not work because I am not connected to that network any more.\nI would appreciate very much if someone could help me finding the solution. \n\nA: A given machine can have multiple domain names, but let's assume that your machine has one (main) fully qualified domain name (FQDN).\nIt is DNS that determines what your machine's fully qualified domain name is, not the machine itself (... although the machine's fully qualified domain name may be recorded locally in one or more configuration files, e.g., in /etc/postfix/main.cf.) \nLet's say your machine's system hostname is foo. Usually the machine is called foo in DNS too (although, to repeat, it can have other names as well.) You need to ask DNS what foo's fully qualified domain name is.\nLet's say your machine's fully qualified domain name is foo.bar.com.\n\"In the old days\" your hosthame would then be foo and /etc/resolv.conf file would contain domain bar.com. (Warning: in the old days different distributions handled the domain name differently, e.g., by including it in the system hostname, but most distros don't do that anymore.)\nNowadays the search option replaces the domain option in /etc/resolv.conf, so you should have instead search bar.com.\nSince Ubuntu 12.04, the file /etc/resolv.conf is supposed to be managed by the resolvconf utility. Suppliers of nameserver information (i.e., nameserver addresses and search domain names) pass the info to resolvconf which writes an up-to-date resolv.conf file at runtime.\nYou are using resolvconf if the package is installed and /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link to ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf.\nLet's assume you are in fact using resolvconf. If you obtain an IP address for your principal network interface via the DHCP protocol then generally the search domain is also supplied via DHCP. In that case you need to configure the DHCP server to supply bar.com as the search domain name. If, on the other hand, your principal network interface is configured statically then you need to enter the search domain name into the network interface configuration utility that you are using (either ifup or NetworkManager). For ifup you put the search domain name on a dns-search line in /etc/network/interfaces and for NetworkManager you put it into the Additional search domains field on the IPv4 Settings tab for the relevant NetworkManager connection.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 13.10 Black Desktop I upgraded my Kubuntu 13.04 i386 installation on my Acer One Aspire to Kubuntu 13.10 Beta 2.

Before the upgrade both wired and wireless connection worked perfect.\n***** uname -a *****\n\nLinux K53SV 3.11.0-12-generic #19-Ubuntu SMP Wed Oct 9 16:20:46 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n***** lsb_release *****\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 13.10\nRelease:    13.10\nCodename:   saucy\n\n***** lspci *****\n\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1030 [Rainbow Peak] [8086:008a] (rev 34)\n    Subsystem: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1030 BGN [8086:5305]\n    Kernel driver in use: iwlwifi\n04:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Not a single picture on my computer.  I press F4 to switch over to my external monitor and...what is this?\n\nA: If the resolution of your monitor isn't quite set up correctly, your video card shows the correct pixels for your desktop, but then the extra monitor space gets filled with essentially random pixels from elsewhere in your video card's memory. From your comments it sounds like that is usually whatever is on the bottom of the previous display screen. If you've never looked at anything with that particular spaceship, it could be an image that is part of a video card self-test, or it could be a hidden background image from some other webpage. \nFixing the external monitor's resolution is the correct fix for this problem. If you've got other issues after doing that, please submit them as separate questions.\n", "Q: How to increase font size in Vim editor?

[...]\nWhen running inside a terminal, Vim can, at most, change the colours (within the limits of the colours supported by the terminal: sometimes bold and unbold black and white, often 8 colours plus bold/unbold foreground only [or seen another way, 8 background and 16 foreground]; on X11 some terminals support up to 256 background and foreground colours; \"changing colours\" usually also includes the use of reverse-video), and, if the terminal supports them (not all terminals do, and even those which do may support it only with certain fonts), use bold, underline and/or italic.\n\nThat being said, if you want to change the font size in Vim editor, you have to change the font size of your terminal. To do this in gnome-terminal go to Edit → Profile Preferences:\n\nMoreover, you can save these preferences in a new terminal profile and when you are start using Vim, use that profile.\n\nA: I tried :set guifont=*\nThis brought up available fonts and sizes to select from\nI found this info with :help guifont\n", "Q: oscilloscope for ubuntu 13.04 I need to import an mp3 or an ogg file and analyse it through an oscilloscope.

Same thing for /proc/asound/cards which should give a hint about what the directory should be called. \n0 [PCH            ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH\n                     HDA Intel PCH at 0xfb200000 irq 51\n1 [NVidia         ]: HDA-Intel - HDA NVidia\n                     HDA NVidia at 0xfb080000 irq 17\n\nI dont think the directory should be called anything like this.\n\nA: Maybe it's a bit late but you can find the /usr/share/alsa/ucm/apq8064-tabla-snd-card/ in the downloadable preinstalled image :)\n", "Q: Wifi stops working in 13.10 OK, my wifi is connecting fine, but it just stop downloading and uploading data.\nThe skype stops, trying to reconnect, the firefox nighly and the google chromium stops loading pages and websites, everythings stops.\nBut when I see the network icon: connected to my wifi.\nThen, I simply reconnect, or disconnect and connect again.\nReconnecting, the wifi starts working again, the skype icon turns green, the browsers work again.\nPreviously, I had 13.04 and never had this problem. When I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10, the wifi started to do this. And the wifi has this problem since the early times of 13.10; since I installed 13.10, the wifi is having this issue (from the first day I installed it).\nAnyone having the same problem? Anyone knows how to fix it?\n\nA: I could not even connect to my building's wifi but for some reason I was able to connect to a friend's wifi network somewhere else. I tried many of the suggestions in here after researching for hours. In the end what did was reverting back to the previous Linux kernel installed, 3.8.x. 13.10 install with the newer kernel version 3.11 and that seems to be the root of a lot of issues.\n", "Q: Xfce Power Manager on Xubuntu 13.10 doesn't work The problem is that its actually works, but something works with Xfce Power Manager at the same time. For example, I set that if I pressed Suspend button (on my Lenovo B560 its Fn+F2 hotkey) then system ask me what to do. But when Log out window appears, system goes to suspend. Another example is closing the lid. I set it to lock the screen via Xfce Power Manager, but system still goes to suspend. I thought that it might be laptop-mode-tools, but it's not installed. Before 13.10 I had 13.04 and everything were fine.\n\nA: for the problem of it suspending when it should not be upon closing of the lid, i believe that editing \n/etc/systemd/logind.conf, \nchanging the following line to read as such:\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\nfixed it for me. \n", "Q: Launch Rhythmbox using a Keyboard shorcut I use Rhythmbox all the time in my Ubuntu. Is it possible to have a custom shortcut like Ctrl+R in Ubuntu, which can launch the Rhythmbox window, even if it is playing in the background ? Since, the emphasis of Linux OS flavors is to use keyboards as much as possible instead of mouse, i thought this functionality might tremendously help me in my Ubuntu environment. \nThe Keyboard shortcuts sections asks for a command; So, I'm not able to figure out how to give a custom keyboard shortcut to a program like Rhythmbox. I'm using 12.04 if that helps. Thanks.\n\nA: Go to System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts and click \"Add\"\nAs name type something you like, as command type \"rhythmbox\" and hit \"Apply\"\nThen click on the right side of the new command where you can set the key combination and press Ctrl + R (or whatever shortcut suits you)\n\nA: You could install xbindkeys-config (which provides a fancy GUI) (sudo apt-get install xbindkeys-config), run xbindkeys-config, and put rhythmbox as the action, hit Get Key, press your key sequence, Save & Apply & Exit. \nI personally find the control panel thing quite unreliable, compared to xbindkeys.\n", "Q: About Ubuntu cloud Server How to install and deploy applications on Ubuntu Cloud Server ?\n What's the difference between Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Cloud live image? \n\nA: This question is better posed at https://ask.openstack.org/en/questions/\n", "Q: Heavy applications lag Xubuntu Ever since i started using Xubuntu I have noticed that whenever I run any heavy application like Eclipse, Tomcat Server or even when I open sites like facebook in multiple tabs in the Web Browser my system begins to lag. Even the mouse movement and Keyboard input are affected by it hence I am unable to open Virtual Console to close the application. The only way to get rid of it is to wait for 15 to 20 min or to reboot the system using REISUB. I tried using applications like Preload but even that didn't help.\nI have not allocated any swap space but the memory usage of the system rarely crosses 2 GB. Even when the heavy applications were running, still more than 1 GB of the RAM was free. \nMy laptop has 4 GB RAM and 2.13 GHz processor. Xubuntu version is 13.04 and i update my system regularly. \n  Earlier i have used other distributions like OpenSuse but they all ran smoothly on my laptop. Even windows runs without any issue. \nIs the swap space the problem or are there any logs i should check ? The dmesg and the kern.log don't show any abnormal behavior. Is there a way to change scheduling method which it uses or to lower priorities of applications so that they don't affect other applications ?\n\nA: If anyone else is facing the same problem, the problem was the swap space.\nWhen I worked on JSP, Tomcat server alone took up around 400 MB memory space. Eclipse and the Browser took up the rest.\nI created a swap file in my root directory using:\nsudo fallocate -l 2048m /mnt/2048MiB.swap \n\nand added it to the fstab after mkswap and swapon commands.

Only thing I was wondering before doing so is will I receive the option to switch between it and windows at start up? And which option do I select during installation to make it possible?\nI have read a few things and saw that there were multiple options and depending on which were selected you would get rid of windows or still keep it.\nOh and would I also have to have split up my HDD into smaller partitions and have one before installing Ubuntu or will it use the part of the partition from either drive C or data drive D?\n\nA: The installer is quite obvious, I suggest you do the partitioning manually, by selecting the \"Something else\" option during installation. But the others are straightforward too.\n\n\nA: Installing 2 operating systems and choosing one of them on startup is called \"dual-boot\". ...Yes you can do that!! :D\nWhen installing Ubuntu you can choose \"Install alongside Windows\" Just as mentioned. It'd then take some space from an existing partition and ask you how much you need.\nYou can choose \"Something else\" for more advanced options. \nOn startup you should see some purplish screen called \"Grub\". Grub is something called a \"boot-loader\". It'd ask you whether you want to use Windows or Ubuntu now.\nI know my answer is late. Sorry. :)\n\nA: I advice you to take a look at this Dual Boot Guide for Ubuntu thoroughly. I'm giving an outline of what you should do for a dual boot. This is not a comprehensive guideline. You should refer to the above document or other sources before performing a dual boot.\nFirst of all, one doesn't have to add anything manually to bring a dual boot menu. Ubuntu (and other linux flavours) does this automatically by installing something called grub. Again, you do not have to worry about this, except that, in windows machine linux should be the last to be installed. That is, if you install windows over Ubuntu, Windows erases this grub and replaces with its own Master Boot Record (or MBR) which does not give you a choice to choose Operating systems.\nHowever, to dual boot you have to perform certain additional steps during installation. First you have to choose \"Something else\" option during the installation window process so that you can manually partition your hard disk or specify one particular partition for installing Ubuntu.\nThe important thing to remember is you cannot identify a windows partition by its drive letter during Ubuntu installation. This is so important for a beginner to understand so that you can avoid unwanted confusion during installation process. One thing you can do is partition you hard disk using your Windows GUI and identify them using their size during the Linux installation process. The drives carry a format something like /dev/hd2 and its size in MB. Again, you can do partition in Ubuntu installation process (it is lot more easier now), but you have to careful in mentioning disk format (like ext4, FAT or NTFS) and size blocks. It is worth noting that Ubuntu requires Ext4 format for its root partition.  I advice you to look for some comprehensive video tutorials on Manual partitioning to get know the installation window before attempting this for first time.\n", "Q: How to uninstall Java 7 binaries installed from Oracle?

Since it can be a security risk and also drains the battery I would like to keep it deactivated. I quickly found the option to turn it off in the settings menu, but the problem is: it doesn't stay dead!\nEverytime I pull my Nexus 4 out of standby mode bluetooth reappears in the top bar as if I never deactivated it.\nHow can I deactivate it so it stays deactivated or better yet how can I remove it from my phone entirely? \nI tried sudo apt-get remove bluez bluetooth, but I am not allowed to edit this package.\n\nA: You can do so by disabling the upstart jobs for bluetooth and bluetooth-touch:\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/bluetooth.override\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/bluetooth-touch.override\n\nThe bluetooth job controls BlueZ, which is the daemon used to establish bluetooth connections, and the bluetooth-touch job controls the programs that enable the bluetooth device on bootup on the phone, based on the model of the device.\n\nA: One way to make this possible is to make /etc/rc.local a symbolic link to /etc/writable/rc.local.\nBug #1261091 has been submitted to hopefully make this happen.\n", "Q: Cannot access secondary GPU running Bumblebee I'm trying to get Bumblebee working again after an upgrade to Saucy.\nRunning software with Optirun gives the following output:\noptirun nvidia-settings\n[   45.697126] [ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: [XORG] (EE) Failed to load /usr/lib/xorg/modules/libglamoregl.so: /usr/lib/xorg/modules/libglamoregl.so: undefined symbol: _glapi_tls_Context\n[   45.697179] [ERROR]Aborting because fallback start is disabled.\n\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?

I removed all packages matching bumblebee, nvidia, primus, and one called bbswitch-dkms. I re-installed bumblebee, bumblebee-nvidia, and mesa-tools. At that point, I could run optirun glxgears and primus glxgears.\nI still find that other applications --- Cool VL Viewer and Imprudence --- which ran under optirun before my upgrade to Saucy now crash. Cool VL Viewer runs without optirun.\nAlso fix some library path problems\nCool VL Viewer and Imprudence required libraries i965.so and swrast.so, which were not on the paths that they searched.\nI worked around the problem, without understanding the root of it, by entering two symbolic links:\n\n/usr/lib64/dri -> /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri\n/usr/lib32/dri -> /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri\n\nI'm not sure whether to regard this as a Bumblebee problem, but the fact that Cool VL viewer worked without optirun, then failed with optirun, and the fact that the unfound libraries appear to relate to Intel graphics rather than Nvidia, suggest that the redirection of Intel calls is failing under some circumstances.\n\nA: I have exactly the same issue - seems to be related to this bug Fix provided there failed to solve this problem for me and it looks like we have to wait for a better release of it.

In my /etc/ssh/ directory, I can see three that I have three different types of ssh keys:\n-rw------- 1 root root    607 Oct  4 22:43 ssh_host_dsa_key\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    623 Oct  4 22:43 ssh_host_dsa_key.pub\n-rw------- 1 root root    241 Oct  4 22:43 ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    194 Oct  4 22:43 ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub\n-rw------- 1 root root   1602 Oct  4 22:43 ssh_host_rsa_key\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    378 Oct  4 22:43 ssh_host_rsa_key.pub\n\nWhat is are the differences between ssh's RSA, DSA, and ECDSA keys, and do I need all three?\n\nA: They're keys generated using different encryption algorithms. You can choose to use different forms of encryption when using SSH, somewhat similar to the ability to choose different encryption methods for WiFi (WPA2, WPA, WEP, etc).\nSSH uses public-key encryption, meaning when you connect to an SSH server it broadcasts a public key which you can use to encrypt further traffic to be sent to that server. If the server is configured to use RSA it will be a key generated by the RSA algorithm.\nYour computer sends back its own public RSA key from the key file you listed in your question. The server needs this key to connect back to you and reply.\nAll three keys exist on your computer because any given SSH server you're connecting to might be configured to use any one of these algorithms. Your computer will send back a unique key matching the type the server uses, your key having been generated on your computer by the same algorithm.\nHere's some further resources:\nhttps://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5096/rsa-vs-dsa-for-ssh-authentication-keys\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA\n\nA: Do you need all of them?\nNo, your ssh server only needs one and the client only needs to support that one type of key for ssh connections.\n\nRSA, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, & Ed25519 are all used for digital signing, but only RSA can also be used for encrypting.\nRSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. It's security relies on integer factorization, so a secure RNG (Random Number Generator) is never needed. Compared to DSA, RSA is faster for signature validation but slower for generation.\nDSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures. It's security relies on a discrete logarithmic problem. Compared to RSA, DSA is faster for signature generation but slower for validation. Security can be broken if bad number generators are used.\nECDSA (Elliptical curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is an Elliptic Curve implementation of DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm). Elliptic curve cryptography is able to provide the relatively the same level of security level as RSA with a smaller key. It also shares the disadvantage of DSA of being sensitive to bad RNGs.\nEdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a digital signature scheme using a variant of Schnorr signature based on Twisted Edwards curves. Signature creation is deterministic in EdDSA and its security is based on the intractability of certain discrete logarithm problems, so it's safer than DSA & ECDSA which requires high quality randomness for each and every signature.\nEd25519, is the EdDSA signature scheme, but using SHA-512/256 and Curve25519; it's a secure elliptical curve that offers better security than DSA, ECDSA, & EdDSA, plus has better performance (not humanly noticeable).\n\nOther notes\nRSA keys are the most widely used, and so seem to be the best supported.\nECDSA, (introduced in OpenSSH v5.7), is computationally lighter than DSA, but the difference isn't noticeable unless you have a machine with very low processing power.\nAs of OpenSSH 7.0, SSH no longer supports DSA keys (ssh-dss) by default. A DSA key used to work everywhere, as per the SSH standard (RFC 4251 and subsequent).\nEd25519 was introduced in openSSH 6.5.\n", "Q: How to upgrade ubuntu-13.04 using a downloaded iso without burning cd or liveusb within ubuntu 13.04?

From 13.04 onwards, I am not using any flags.\n", "Q: Problem with function fpos_t and fgetpos when I try to use those functions it sends this error: \nmain.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:\nmain.cpp:11:17: error: conversion from ‘int’ to non-scalar type ‘fpos_t {aka _G_fpos_t}’ requested\nmain.cpp:18:20: error: cannot convert ‘fpos_t {aka _G_fpos_t}’ to ‘FILE* {aka _IO_FILE*}’ for argument ‘1’ to ‘int fgetpos(FILE*, fpos_t*)’\n\nThe code is:\n#include<stdio.h>\n\nstruct registro{\n        char nombre[5];\n        };\n\nint main()\n{\nFILE *fp;\nregistro datos[5];\nfpos_t posicion=5;\n\nfp = fopen(\"nombres.txt\",\"w\"); //CREA UN ARCHIVO DE TEXTO\n\nprintf(\"ingrese nombre: \");\ngets(datos[1].nombre);\n\nfgetpos(posicion,fp);\nfwrite(&datos[1],5,1,fp); //ESCRIBE EL VALOR DE DATOS EN FP, CON UN TAMAÑO DE 5\nfflush(stdin);\nfclose(fp);\n}\n\nIf you see any error please help.\n\nA: Looks more like a stackoverflow kind of question but anyway, from what I can get from the error message, the problem is with the posiciion=5 part of the code.

The ones that are there by default (Home, Desktop, Documents, etc.) work fine. I can right click on them and rename them. However, I cannot remove any of them. The option is there \"Remove\" but disabled/grayed out.\nThe same is true if I try to add bookmarks. I go to \"Files -> Bookmarks\", and all the bookmarks show up, but the buttons at the bottom to add, remove, or re-order the bookmarks are simply disabled.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Custom bookmarks\nTo add and remove custom bookmarks, refer to the documentation in Files ▸ Help ▸ Edit folder bookmarks:\n\nAdd a bookmark:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the folder (or location) that you want to bookmark.\n  \n*Click the gear button in the toolbar and pick Bookmark this Location.\nDelete a bookmark:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click on Files in the top bar and pick Bookmarks from the app menu.\n  \n*In the Bookmarks window, select the bookmark you wish to delete and click the - button.\n\nThe \"gear button\" is on the right side of Nautilus:\n\nIt will be grayed out if the location you've opened is already bookmarked.\nPlaces\nThe bookmarks seen under the \"Places\" heading are an exception:\n\nThey're not just bookmarks, but XDG user directories with a separate configuration backend, so the Nautilus developers deliberately chose to disable removing them. \nThe issue of working around this limitation is being discussed in this question.\n\nA: I think I may have stumbled upon a way to add a bookmark for, say, the UbuntuOne folder.\nFirst up, I connected to a SMB server, and I found that I was able to create a bookmark for this connection.  This action created the Bookmarks entry in the left pane of Nautilus.

I can use this command to do it temporarily (until reboot):\n/usr/bin/setxkbmap -option \"caps:swapescape\"\n\nI tried adding that command as a Startup Application, but it doesn't seem to do anything.  \n\nA: For Ubuntu 18.04 and Gnome 3.30 this works for me:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"['caps:swapescape']\"\n\n\nA: I've built a tool in C specially for this purpose that overcome many of the issues with the xcape/xmodmap solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/oblitum/caps2esc\nIt does a bit more since it also turn CAPSLOCK as both ESC and CTRL.\n\nA: Okay, found a way to do this using gnome-tweak-tool.\nFrom a terminal, run\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool -y && gnome-tweak-tool\n\nYou can find an option to swap Caps Lock and Esc in \"Typing -> Caps Lock key behavior\".\nUpdate: In Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 it can be found in Keyboard & Mouse > Additional Layout Options > Caps Lock Behavior (Thanks to Adracus's comment below)\n\nA: I'm late to answer, but the usual way to swap Esc and Ctrl is with the following lines in the ~/.Xmodmap file:\nclear Lock\nkeysym Caps_Lock = Escape\nkeysym Escape = Caps_Lock\nadd Lock = Caps_Lock\n\nThis should work with all desktop environments (KDE, Gnome) on most common distros (Ubuntu and Debian family, Fedora and RH family).\n\nA: You can use xmodmap in terminal to swap Caps Lock with Esc:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock\"   #this will make Esc to act as Caps Lock\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 66 = Escape NoSymbol Escape\"        #this will make Caps Lock to act as Esc\n\nTo get this change for every session, after you have run the ​​previous commands create a file called .xmodmap with the new keymaps, using the following command:\nxmodmap -pke > ~/.xmodmap\n\nThen, create a file called .xinitrc in your home directory, containing the following line/command:\nxmodmap .xmodmap\n\n\nA: Similar to @Radu's answer, but compatible with 14.04 (see also this answer).\nxmodmap -e \"remove Lock = Caps_Lock\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 66 = Escape NoSymbol Escape\"\nxmodmap -pke > ~/.xmodmap\n\nIf it does not work, replace:\nxmodmap -e \"remove Lock = Caps_Lock\"\n\nwith:\nxmodmap -e \"clear Lock\"\n\n\nA: This can be done from the \"Keyboard Layout\" system setting. Click on \"options\" for the layout you are using, then under \"Caps Lock key behavior\" choose \"switch Escape and Capslock\".\n\nA: Go to the gears icon at the top right corner of the screen and do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Click System Settings → Keyboard layout → Options... (lower right hand corner) → Caps lock key behaviour (4th down).\n\n\n*Then scroll down and select Swap ESC and Caps Lock.\nDone!\n\nA: Another way to do this is through the dconf-editor. This method has a few extra steps from gnome-tweak-tool, but is useful if you don't want to pull in the dependencies from the tweak tool.\nThis will allow you to use the caps:swapescape syntax and automatically make the change permanent.\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nOn Ubuntu >20.04, you'll need to run the following - see this post:\nsudo apt install dconf-cli dconf-editor\n\nAfter starting the dconf-editor, navigate to org >> gnome >> desktop >> input-sources\nAdd the options that you need in xkb-options. The option strings are surrounded by single quotes and separated by commas. Be careful not to delete the brackets on the ends.\n\nYou can use this method to enter most of the traditional xkb options that are no longer available in System Settings >> Text Entry. The exception are the settings for switching the keyboard layouts, which currently do not work because of a bug.\nFor a list of the options and the syntax, use man 7 xkeyboard-config in a terminal.\nAnother common option that could be used is terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp to allow ctrl+alt+backspace to end the X-session.\n\nA: Run this command once in a terminal.  dconf should already be installed with gnome 3.\ndconf write \"/org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options\" \"['caps:swapescape']\"\n\n\nA: The Keyboard Layout with Switch Escape and Capslock answer above is no longer valid on Ubuntu 16.04 and later (was it before? dunno).\nIn order to avoid the hustle with permissions etc., just switch to root before you start doing the following steps by running su in a terminal and entering your root password. Then:\n\n*\n\n*Run:\ncd /etc/default/\nvim keyboard\n\n\n\n*There you will see the line:\nXKBOPTIONS=\"\"\n\nChange it to:\nXKBOPTIONS=\"caps:swapescape\"\n\n\n\n*Exit Vim with save:\n:wqa\n\n\n\n*Reboot.\nAnd that will be permanent, I promise. :)\n\nA: A solution that should work for most linux distros:\nsetxkbmap -option caps:swapescape\n\nOther options are possible:\n\n*\n\n*caps:none to deactivate\n\n*caps:escape to make it an additional escape\n\n*caps:super to make it an additional super (windows) key.\n\nTo make this work at startup, you can put it in ~/.profile as this will only run after the interactive login.\nIf the switch does not persist between logins (e.g. when suspending your machine) you can also create a .xinitrc file in your home directory and put it there. Linux mint 20 on a laptop works impeccable with this option.\n\nA: Assuming you're using the us layout with the default model and variant, you can use this command:\nsudo localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap us \"\" \"\" \"caps:swapescape\"\nUnlike ~/.Xmodmap, which applies after login, this command changes the default system layout and applies to the login screen, which is useful if you use an alternative layout like dvorak.\nFor more info/examples of the command see this arch wiki article: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Using_localectl\n\nA: On KDE GUI (graphical user interface), This can be done from Keyboard Layout on System Setting. Click on \"Input Devices\". On the top left corner, click Keyboard. Then click \"Advanced\" tab.and under \"Caps Lock key behavior\" choose \"switch Escape and Capslock\".\n\nA: Note: This does not swap, only maps caps lock to esc. (This was good enough for my vim usecase.)\nFor ubuntu 16:04 (with i3 environment):\ncreated file ~/.xessionrc with content\nxmodmap -e \"clear lock\" #disable caps lock switch\nxmodmap -e \"keysym Caps_Lock = Escape\" #set caps_lock as escape\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 18.04:\nCreate file ~/.xmodmaprc\nxmodmap -e \"clear lock\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 66 = Escape NoSymbol Escape\"\n\nSource this file to bind the keys in your current session:\n$ . \"$HOME/.xmodmaprc\"\n\nAppend this command to ~/.bashrc for the keys to be bound every time you log in.\nThis answer is similar to Gilly's answer but with a lowercase \"l\" in \"clear lock\".\n\nA: In Linux Mint 19.3 from the Menu:\nPreferences\nKeyboard\nLayouts\nOptions\nCaps lock behaviour\nSwap ESC and Caps Lock\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 lts cannot build a wireless connection Hi i just got a new notebook and it came with ubuntu 12.04 lts operation system.

At some point, (likely 2011ish) I installed Ubuntu onto the laptop, as well as keeping the Vista OS. Regardless, when Vista died, I was able to extract Vista files via Ubuntu. That's the history of the computer.\nAfter a while, I attempted to re-install Vista onto the laptop, which just wouldn't happen. So, I obtained a 32gb Thumb-drive, and installed the maximum number of GB downloadable possible of Ubuntu on the Thumb-drive, to install onto the laptop, as a standalone OS.\nMy question, in it's entirety.. bears my curiosity around whether I have a \"32GB\" type Ubuntu.. or if it expanded on it's own. In essence, if I can allow Ubuntu to work off of my computer, rather than the file size I had allocated on the thumb-drive, in order to get a faster, more responsive experience. \n\n\n*\n\n*As an example, if I had downloaded the 2GB sized Ubuntu, and installed it only this computer.. is that end result different from the 30ish GB download? I'd like to know if my computer still has \"space\" for more Ubuntu. When I had both Vista and Ubuntu at once, I feel there isn't too much of a difference revolving around my current Ubuntu experience, when it stands alone on this laptop.\n\n\nHopefully I clarified my question. I wanted to know if Ubuntu expanded, using the computer in it's entirety.. or if it's capped based on what was contained with that 30GB ish download size, which I imported onto a thumb-drive to install onto this laptop.\nThank you for any assistance or knowledge on the matter. It's greatly appreciated. :)\n\nA: You mean 32-bit, which has nothing to do with file size or hard drives. 32-bit with PAE only allows programs to use up to 4GB of RAM, and only 32-bits of memory access at a time. 64-bit allows you to use an amount of RAM so great that for the hardware of the foreseeable future, it might as well be infinite. There's no limit to how much hard drive space you can use. I have mine installed with a total of 7000GB combined hard drive space.\n", "Q: How can I run a sudo sh at startup?

I tried a Chrome extension called Hacker Vision. It did not work. If anyone knows another way it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: The High Contrast extension from Google claims to do what you want in part:\n\nHigh Contrast lets you browse the web with your choice of several high-contrast color filters designed to make it easier to read text.\nWhen you install this extension, all pages are \"inverted\", so black becomes white and white becomes black. Press the \"browser action\" icon in the toolbar to toggle it on and off, or customize your settings on a per-site basis. Use a convenient keyboard shortcut to quickly change your settings while your browse.\nOther extensions try to change the default colors, but this ends up breaking many popular websites. Only this extension applies filters to your page that invert almost everything - the only exception is photos, which are left alone.\nAlso note that the Chrome web store and other built-in pages like the New Tab page and Settings pages are unaffected - extensions like this one are not allowed to modify them, by design.\n\n(text not Bold in the original)\nHowever, there's is the black becomes white aspect to deal with.\nAnother, do-it-yourself extension is Stylish:\n\nRestyle the web with Stylish, a user styles manager. Stylish lets you easily install themes and skins for Google, Facebook,…\nUser styles are themes for web sites. User styles empower your browsing experience by letting you customize web sites. Take out irrelevant content, change colors, or completely redesign the entire site.\n\nYou may be able to use that extension successfully, depending on your competence in CSS or good luck in finding dark \"styles\" here. An example of a decent dark style is NightShift - eye care.\nThere's also an active help forum for Stylish here.\nI prefer the Stylish extension over High Contrast. Stylish gives me more \"control\" over the page than does High Contrast. The forum is pretty helpful as well.\n\nA: Go to the developers settings in your Chromium Browser (chrome://flags) and from there search and enable \"Force Dark Mode for Web Contents\".\n", "Q: Are all \"Important security updates\", updates to already installed packages? I'm running 12.04, and I've never downloaded any drivers for the installation of any peripheral devices. Yet, I noticed a fair few \"Important security updates\" involving drivers/utilities for HP devices/software.\nI understand if the default installation of Ubuntu came with a set of drivers for these devices - and the update manager, having noticed that they live on my system, went and found newer versions, but still - given I don't use any devices - I'm either forced to download an irrelevant update, sift through the updates to check applicability, or turn off Update Manager altogether: none of which are desirable.\nFirst; the obvious - can someone confirm that the list of \"Important security updates\" on the server that Update manager connects to, is not actually populated with every patch ever written (i.e. for all Ubuntu packages regardless of whether they're installed or not)? Unlikely, but..\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu only installs updates for stuff installed on your system. But if you don't trust what Ubuntu is telling you, why trust me? If you want evidence, install ubuntu once with only the default packages, then again with every single package installed. You should be able to do a number of comparisons that will quench your thirst for empirical data.\nUbuntu by default includes tons of drivers for things that aren't currently attached to your system. The extremely common case is that right now I don't have device X plugged into my computer, but I might later, and I'll be pissed if Ubuntu doesn't just work even though it could, especially at the cost of a few kilobytes or megs. (and for more people than you might think, downloading drivers on demand is impossible. we need a working system all the time, not just when connected to the internet)\nUbuntu is not a good distro if you want extremely fine grained control over everything.

Re-enabling them one at a time, I found that Ubuntu FireFox Modifications 2.8 was causing the performance issues. That add-on wasn't installed by me, but must have been added automatically with the upgrade.\nIf anyone else runs into the issue, go to the Tools menu and click Add-ons.

I have what some might consider a trivial use for VNC, but I'd like to get it to work and it's technically interesting to me.\nMy use case is that I'd like sometimes to be able to control my desktop from my living room while watching tv.  The desktop runs Ubuntu, currently 12.04, but that may change soon.  I'm using the default Vino server.\nI'd like to control it from my iPad and I have a nicely performing WiFi.  I got the well-regarded (if reviews can be believed) app Vnc Viewer for the iPad.\nIt's not working as well as I'd hoped.  The problem is the speed of repainting.  It's abysmally slow.  I can click a close button, walk over to the desktop and see that the window has closed, but on the iPad, the VNC Client won't show the close for minutes if ever.  I've noticed that CLOSING windows takes a lot longer to update than to open them.\nSo the question is is this primarily client or server-caused?  And if server-caused what can be done about it?  Is Vino the best client or is something else better?\n\nA: According to RealVNC tech support (the authors of VNC Viewer client IPad software), their server software works better than Vino, with VNC Viewer and I have found that to be true.  With that in use, the viewer is much more responsive.  They have a free Linux server package for noncommercial use.  \n\n\n*\n\n*https://realvnc.com/download/vnc/latest\nIt appears that the Vino-VNC Viewer combo is less than ideal.  Going with the free RealVNC Server instead of Vino is an improvement.

If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory.\nSwap space can be a dedicated swap partition (recommended), a swap file, or a combination of swap partitions and swap files.\nSwap should equal 2x physical RAM for up to 2 GB of physical RAM, and then an additional 1x physical RAM for any amount above 2 GB, but never less than 32 MB.\nI'm not sure about the 1st partition, but your system(OS) should be installed in 2nd partition that you can't delete.\nYes you can delete/disable/enable/add/remove 3rd partition i,e Swap.\nBut it is not recommended to not allot any  memory space for swap.\nHere is the command which you can use to enable/disable swap memeory:\nto disable:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nto enable:\nsudo swapon -a\n\nGet more info:\nsudo swapoff -h \n\nor \nsudo swapon -h\n\nIf you provide some more information by posting the output of these commands then I'll be able to give some more information:\nsudo blkid\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo free\ndf -h\n\nReply if you need further assistance..\n\nA: Saurav Kumar's answer is correct, but to address your first partition, it looks like an EFI System Partition (ESP). This partition holds boot loaders on computers that use EFI/UEFI firmware. If I'm right, you should NOT delete this partition, since doing so will render the computer unbootable.\nAlso, your disk uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT). The fdisk utility is useless on GPT disks. (The very latest version has limited GPT support, but you're obviously not using that version.) Instead of fdisk, you should use gdisk or parted on GPT disks.\n", "Q: How to move a window if titlebar is overlapped by Ubuntu menu Somehow the title-bar of chrome was overlapped by Ubuntu menu-bar like attached image.\nIn this case how to move this chrome window?\n\n\nA: press Alt+F7 Then move the mouse, the window will move with it.\n\nA: Hold down the left Alt key and left click and drag the window to a new position.

My Laptop suspends and resumes properly, but the built-in laptop screen does not turn back on when resuming for some strange reason. I have to do a hard reset to make the laptop screen wake back up. This problem for me is longstanding, and started with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (I now run Ubuntu 13.10) and never got fixed since (I'm thinking it is a bug that never got fixed all this time). It is an issue I believe with the graphics drivers (Stock X.org Drivers shipped with Ubuntu).\nHere is another strange thing, when I have a external monitor plugged in (VGA or HDMI), and resume it from suspend (assuming it was already in suspend), the laptop screen still doesn't turn on, but the external monitor, regardless of connection, turns on normally. \nMy graphics card is a AMD Radeon HD 6620G, that is integrated on my AMD A8-3500M APU CPU.\n\nA: I have this also as well with my old Dell that has an ATI card in it.

I was using the Totem player when the problem occurred, so I tried to install the VLC media player.\nIt wouldn't read the disc at all, so I uninstalled the player.  Now, the Totem player won't even begin playing the DVD.  The player sometimes doesn't even open up when I insert the DVD, and other times it will but says it can't read it.  I've tried several different DVD's and CD's with similar results.  The computer is recognizing the optical drive, because when I open \"Files\",  it shows the drive and the disc, but can't play it.  Previously, I ran Ubuntu 13.04 with the Gnome desktop installed from the software center, and I had no issues.  Any help is appreciated!\n\nA: Well it seems that your DVD's are encrypted. In this case, installing the restricted packages only would not help. You would also need to install libdvdcss to play encrypted DVD's. Run this from terminal:\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\nAlso remember you need to have libdvdread4 installed before running the above code. You may not need to install libdvdread4 since you have already installed ubuntu-restricted-extras. A reboot may be necessary after running the script.\nFor more reference you can view: RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Copy and Paste this command:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Enter Your Password\n\n*Press Enter\n\n\nUbuntu Restricted Extras will now be installed, giving you the opportunity to watch DVD's.\n\nA: you need to install both of them.so in short.\n1.open terminal\n2.enter into terminal\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n3.enter password.\n4.enter into terminal\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\n5.you are done.\nyou may also want to read this\nNOTE\n\nPatent and copyright laws operate differently depending on which country you are in. Please obtain legal advice if you are unsure whether a particular patent or restriction applies to a media format you wish to use in your country.\n\n\nA: Ok, I finally found the answer that worked for me on two different machines! First, run in the terminal: \nsudo apt-get install regionset vlc\n\nThat installs the region code stuff and the VLC Media Player.\nThen run another command in the terminal:\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\nIt might be a good idea to reboot before using. Hope this works for everybody else!\n\nA: The original poster is probably experiencing this bug which originates in gstreamer, the software used for reading the video stream. The best way to find out if your're affected by the bug is to launch totem player in the terminal console and see if the console displays such message (or very similar) upon hitting the error:\n** (totem:7868): CRITICAL **: gst_video_decoder_allocate_output_frame: assertion 'frame->output_buffer == NULL' failed \n\nThis bug has already been resolved in the gstramer software but the fix still need to find its way to Ubuntu. In the meantime installing VLC, which uses its own software for decoding, should be fine for playing DVD.\nSome may find it useful to set VLC as the default player for videos and DVD/removable medias as explained there.\n", "Q: The ADT tools bar does not work?

Everything seemed to go smoothly except one niggling thing I can't seem to fix. Previously, I had set the power button to suspend my computer when it was pressed- I was able to set this in the Xfce Power manager.\nHowever after the upgrade, pressing the power button will shutdown the computer rather than suspending. I did a test and checked the logs and found this when I pressed the power button:\nauth.log:Oct 21 22:48:35 Inspiron-1564 systemd-logind[748]: Power key pressed.\nauth.log:Oct 21 22:48:35 Inspiron-1564 systemd-logind[748]: Powering Off...\nauth.log:Oct 21 22:48:35 Inspiron-1564 systemd-logind[748]: System is powering down.\n\nI'm stuck here. Somehow systemd-logind thinks I want to shut the computer down, but I'm not sure where those settings may be. Any help is greatly appreciated.\nAdditionally, while this post has an answer that has a roundabout method of solving the problem, I will not accept that as an answer because it essentially doesn't work, and is not how the problem should be solved.\n\nA: It seems that systemd-logind is in conflict with xfce4-power-manager. This seems to resolve it for me with xubuntu on and Inspiron 9400.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tell systemd-logind to ignore the power button. Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+t. And enter the following command to edit the file:\ngksu leafpad /etc/systemd/logind.conf\nUn-comment the line for HandlePowerKey and change the value from poweroff to ignore so that it looks like this:\nHandlePowerKey=ignore\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the service\nsudo service systemd-logind restart\n\n*Use xfce4-power-manager-settings to set the power button action\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Can't remove GPT data from MBR I am having difficulty getting the Ubuntu installer (and gparted) to recognize the partitions on my MBR type disk.

Your particular computer could have a weak signal, and when combined with the interference, that could cause the problem.\nOftentimes those are using the same ISM band http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band frequencies, but since they are not WiFi devices they can jam the WiFi band and break your connection.

When connecting my computer to a monitor via HDMI, I have no problem getting the sound to come from the monitor speakers. My problem is that after disconnecting the HDMI cable, my computer's speakers don't produce any sound from YouTube, VLC, Spotify, and etc. What's odd though is that system sounds are still there, such as the sounds you get when pushing on the increase or decrease volume buttons. Also, the sound test in sound settings works perfectly. Any solutions? Could it just be a bug because this is a new release?\n\nA: PulseAudio Volume Control lets you set the output device of each app that's currently playing sound.  It seems like the default sound settings dialog should have this functionality, but currently it doesn't.\n\nA: I have the same problem. The solution i found is changing the profile hardware to \"Stéréo analogique Output\" in Audio hardware setup (click on mixer -> mixer -> settings -> audio setup). It seems that when connecting an external monitor, ubuntu automatically changes the audio hardware to HDMI output.\n\nA: I had similar problem.

If I can somehow debug, I can get to the solution.\n\nA: The '>'-operator only redirects everything that is written to your stdout (check: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/876239/bash-redirect-and-append-both-stdout-and-stderr). Stderr is a separate outputstream, that is why your wrong cron does not work, since it writes to stderr (a typical shell shows both stdout and stderr). To append both stderr and stdout to a file, use '&>' in stead of '>'.\nNow to your problem: it seems Ec2-stop-instances is not writing to stdout neither. Using\n10 * * * * ubuntu /usr/bin/ec2-stop-instances [instanceid] &> /tmp/ec2.log\n\nshould fix your problem.\nAnother way to write is, is to redirect stderr (usually stream 1) to where stdout (usually stream 1) goes by appending 2>&1 to your construct:\n10 * * * * ubuntu /usr/bin/ec2-stop-instances [instanceid] > /tmp/ec2.log 2&>1\n\n", "Q: What keyboard layout does my MacBook 7.1 have?

Apparently I need 174m on boot and am 40m short.\n\nA: Yes, if you are only ever using the low latency kernel, and it is working and the packages for it are installed, then you can remove the packages that provide the generic kernel. You might prefer not to, but if you need space in /boot and removing old kernels is insufficient, this is reasonable. Nothing bad is likely to happen, except that if you decide you want to run the generic kenrel then you'll have to install it first.\nYou've checked that you actually are running the low latency kernel, and that the version number matches kernel packages you have installed, by checking the output of uname -r. So it's fine to remove the -generic packages.  Be careful to avoid removing more packages than you intend.\nYou should also make sure that you will receive updates to your low latency kernel. The linux-lowlatency package, which is a metapackage, declares dependencies on the most recent low latency kernel packages for your Ubuntu release; I recommend you install that unless you know you do not want it (and why). If you just want the kernel but not the  header files for it then you can install the linux-image-lowlatency metapackage but not linux-lowlatency.\nIf you're using the LTS Enablement Stack with a low latency kernel then you'll want the metapackage shown in those instructions for your release, just with lowlatency instead of generic.\nFinally, note that most users will prefer the generic kernel, so as errikos suggests, you might consider the alternative of switching back to generic unless you have a specific reason you need to sacrifice other performance characteristics for low latency. See Why choose a low latency kernel over a generic or realtime one? If you do switch back, I recommend you ensure the necessary generic packages are installed and reboot to test that at least one generic kernel that you have installed is actually working (it should be! but try just in case) before you uninstall the lowlatency kernels.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox is not launching I'm using  Rhythmbox 2.99 in Ubuntu 13.10, and when I first launch the application it searches for music and works like a charm, but if I try to launch it later again nothing happens.

I was using LibreOffice 3, then  I had upgraded to LibreOffice 4, because I was somewhat eager to try a new version. \nNow since I found that LibreOffice 4 has some issues, including handling my native language, I want to move back to LibreOffice 3.\nThis question How to downgrade from LibreOffice 4.0 to 3.6? has already some answers which has some similarity with my above mentioned issue, but it does not solve my problem. This question talks about downgrading from a specific version of LibreOffice, namely from 4.0 to 3.6. The solutions mentioned are not the ones I am looking for. They will work, but the  solutions suggest either downloading .deb files for LibreOffice 3.6 or adding PPA for them. Furthermore, some of the answers put out-of-proportion~(applicable for the solution, however) stress on use of synaptic, not general command-line-solution.   \nI want a general solution without using PPA or downloading .deb files. All I want is to move back from the (higher) PPA version to the (lower) official version.\nAnyway, in order to accomplish this, I removed the LibreOffice config directory from my home and then purged LibreOffice from my machine.\nsudo apt-get purge libreoffice-*\n\nThen I removed the relevant PPA's using the sudo apt-add-repository --remove command. And then ran sudo apt-get update.\nNow, when I try to install LibreOffice using the command\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\n\nI get an avalanche of output about unmet dependencies, something like,\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libreoffice : Depends: libreoffice-core (= 1:3.5.7-0ubuntu4) but it is not going to be installed\n(snipped)\n\n\nIf I dig the issue further, by using the command,\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-core\n\nI get \n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:  libreoffice-core :\nDepends: libreoffice-common (> 1:3.5.7) but it is not going to be\ninstalled\n                Depends: libexttextcat0 (>= 2.2-8) but it is not going to be installed\n                Depends: ure (>= 3.5.7~) but it is not going to be installed E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\n\nCould you please tell me how do I install LibreOffice 3 in my machine?\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\nEDIT\nBefore receiving the accepted answer, I was wondering, at this very moment, if I take a fresh computer, and install Ubuntu 12.04, LibreOffice installation will work without a hitch. Then why I can not install LibreOffice in my 12.04 machine today from simple command line?  Then the accepted answer clarified everything. I need to use ppa-purge so that this resets all packages from a PPA to the standard versions released for my distribution.  Basically it is like a way to restore my system back to the way it was before my installed packages from a PPA. This article further elaborates the idea. \nThe above mentioned answer worked perfectly for me. Actually, this was an education for me since it taught me how do downgrade a package that was added via PPA. And I realized that the answer actually teaches us to \"move from PPA installation  of a package to official lower version package.\"\n\n\nA: You need the ppa-purge utility to downgrade all the packages installed by the PPA and disable the PPA.\nSince you have removed the PPA from your sources list, you have to add it back.\nThen, run:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:<your_ppa_name_here>\n\nThen you can install LibreOffice 3 from the official repositories.\nRegards.\n\nA: Open Terminal To Remove Previous LibreOffice Installation\nCopy & Paste Command:\nsudo apt-get remove libreoffice*.*\n\nPress Enter\nDownload LibreOffice From Website\nRight Click & Extract LibreOffice Folder\nRename It libreoffice\nCut & Paste To Desktop\nGo Into DEBS Folder\nRight Click & Select Open In Terminal\nCopy & Paste Command:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nPress Enter\nLibreOffice Is Now Installed\n", "Q: vicious circle between \"sudo dpkg--reconfigure -a\" and \"kernel panic\" I am using Ubuntu 13.04, today I run software manager, it listed lots of stuff around 250mb including new kernel 3.8.0-32 and while installing them kernel panic occured, I shut down my laptop on power button.

I recently installed Ubuntu on my laptop. \nI decided to create a logical partition to store my big files (music, videos, pictures...) somewhere else than the home folder, so I created this partition during the new Ubuntu installation process in ext4 format, using the mount-point /data. I'll later try to redirect my Pictures, Videos and Documents from /home in this /data folder, using symbolic links.\nHowever, I just read an article that explains how to create a storage partition after Ubuntu installation, using GParted to mount the unused space on a /mnt/storage folder (for example).\nWhat's the difference between these two methods, and what do you think is the best to follow?\n\nA: Could you link to the article, so we can see exactly what is explained?\nAnyway, I would recommend to set up all the partitons during the install, then everything is taken care of with gparted and /etc/fstab is correct - you do not have to edit it manually afterwards.

It shows (apparently) a large primary partition and a logical partition with two logical volumes, but the partition numbers and file system types are wrong. The only encouraging part is that the sizes and layout are reasonable. \nThe fsck.ext2 output is meaningless for two reasons. \n\n\n*\n\n*You ran it on the device instead of a parition, e.g., /dev/sdb instead of /dev/sdb1\n\n*This is an ntfs partition, fsck.ext2 is the wrong tool.\n\n\nFormatting prospects: health check required\nThe partition map corruption is worrisome. I'd use a tool like gnome-disk-utility that will run the short SMART test and show general health, and let you format it.

First, I thought it was because I had too many windows open and the RAM was full, but when the problems persisted after a reboot, I knew it was more than that. I immediately started to back up recent files. About half an hour later, the hard drive failed audibly and the laptop wouldn’t boot anymore.\nIf your hard drive has failed physically, maybe this little guide can help you or at least give you some hope.

Yesterday, I was very excited about initial support for optimus using nvidia-prime package on Ubuntu 13.10. It seemed to be the way to replace my bumblebee + hybrid-screenclone configuration, since there is no patch available for the intel video driver that ships with Ubuntu 13.10. After hours of trials and errors, I only got a system where external and LCD displays randomly works or not, LCD screen flickers,  window decorations are broken, and display randomly freeze. Not really usable so far...\nBut now my question is: even if nvidia-prime was working as expected, why would I want to use it? The reason optimus is there is to allow switching off discrete card when I don't need it, to save on battery power. But with nvidia-prime, it seems discrete card is always powered. Why someone would want to use an unstable optimus support that doesn't save power?\nThe conclusion: if I need to save batteries and I don't need external display, I just need to boot with display adapter set to integrated in the BIOS. If I need external display and I'm connected on sector, I just need to boot with discrete display adapter. And if I need to boot in Windows, I just need to put back the display adapter setting to optimus. \n\nA: For nvidia-prime to work, remove bumblebee and bumblebee-nvidia with a --purge first. Reinstall nvidia driver with nvidia prime. nvidia-prime uses the implementation of Nvidia's Optimus technology but in this case, the nvidia driver always stays on regardless of system load and the intel driver is only used as a sink. The advantage of this is better framerates than bumblebee but of course more battery consumption and heat as well. With kernel 3.12 the automatic switching like in Windows would be implemented.\n\nA: I am not sure if this answers your question. But i find nvidia-prime could be a welcome relief to the crowd who have  an nvidia card with optimus , and have no way to switch between an optimus setting/ non optimus setting like you can . In case of my laptop , which is the Dell XPS 15 L502X, i cannot switch modes in BIOS , and nvidia-prime let me use my nvidia card for a while , until i found it to be really a pain with an external display plugged in (broken window decorations mostly) . \nI am guessing that this will improve once new updates roll in though. Hope that gets rid of some confusion. \nPS : Also , as someone who might be interested in using the features of the nvidia card than not having any access to it , i wouldnt mind the power trade off. I will be a happy man if i can just use my nvidia card and for instance , use the openGL 4+ features :)\nEdit - I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 , and nvidia-prime (0.5 is the latest update) once installed , lets you switch between the intel/nvidia graphics processor. The nvidia-settings app lets you choose this as well (i m not sure if nvidia prime is essential for this, but i kept it anyway). So looks like all my optimus issues are solved for the moment.

It says: You are not the owner Now I assume I have to log in as root? but how do I log in as root and what is the standard password for root? Also how can I just give my own user the same permissions? Again I have little knowledge about linux and ubuntu etc. \n\nA: Ubuntu by default does not allow login as root. This is for security reasons. Ubuntu uses sudo, which allows users to issue commands with administrative privleges.\nThe user created during installation is automatically made an administrative user, meaning is already set up to use sudo.\nDon't use the graphical file manager. Instead use the terminal.\nctrl+alt+t will open the terminal.\ncd /var/www will get you to the directory.\nYou can delete files with sudo rm [files to delete].\nYou will be prompted for your sudo password, which is the same as your regular password. Nothing will show on the screen as you type your password.\nBe very careful. rm removes files immediately and is generally not able to be undone. Check and double-check for typos. \nYou can use rm -i [filename] to get an Are you sure? prompt. \n\nA: There are 2 ways to solve this problem.\n1) add yourself to the owner group and set the premission using chmod to 775(see below)\nThis can be done by the following commands:\nsudo adduser yourusername www-data\n\nThat is assuming the owner group is www-data. It could also be \"apache\", just check what works.\nNext you'll have to change the permissions for the files for yourself using chmod.\nWhen using chmod, you need to be aware that there are three types of Linux users that you are setting permissions for. Therefore, when setting permissions, you are assigning them for \"yourself\", \"your group\" and \"everyone else\" in the world. \nTherefore, when setting permissions on a file, you will want to assign all three levels of permissions, and not just one user.\nSo, in laymen terms, if you wanted a file to be readable and executable by everyone, and writable and executable by only you, you would write the chmod command with the following structure.\nCOMMAND : OWNER : GROUP : WORLD : PATH\n\nso in your case it would have to be like this:\nchmod -R 775 /var/www\n\n(The -R is to make it recursive, meaning all subfolders get the same permissions)\nThe numbers reprisent this table\n7 = 4+2+1 (read/write/execute)\n6 = 4+2 (read/write)\n5 = 4+1 (read/execute)\n4 = 4 (read)\n3 = 2+1 (write/execute)\n2 = 2 (write)\n1 = 1 (execute)\n\nThe other solution is to change the permissions to 745 without adding yourself to the www-group.\nPlease DO NOT use 777 for your webserver file permissions!!!\n", "Q: Install Epson nx430 with 64 bit Ubuntu 13.10 I used the printer set up in system settings and the drivers will not install.

Many thanks - I just can't figure this out!\n\nA: There is a -F option:\n-F, --fixed-strings\nInterpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.  (-F is specified by POSIX.)\n\nThis will disable searching by regular expressions and interpreting characters like * or .. Example:\n$ cat test \na**__\n$ grep -F 'a**__' test \na**__\n\n\nA: You should use an escape character (\\)  in front of * because, otherwise, your string to search will became a regular expression. \nFor example, if you want to search for **__, you can use:\n grep -irI \"\\*\\*__\" ~/\n\nMore about: In a regular expression, which characters need escaping?.\n\nA: A simple double quote (\" \") with an escape character ( '\\' )will do the job.\nfor example if I want to search for ind*x.html from the current folder I will use :\ngrep -r \"ind\\*x.html\" ./\n\nNote : If you are not using without quotes then you need to use two backslash.\ngrep -r ind\\\\*x.html ./\n\nBoth will search for ind*x.html term in the files.\n", "Q: corrupted iso image How can I download a complete iso?\nI have downloaded 13.10 in each variation using different browsers and even torrent.

A check with RKhunter, top and htop did not not come across anything suspicious.\nI ended up using the shred command and installing Ubuntu 12.04. I think the matter is resolved now but remain vigilant. So, I am not sure if re-installing Firefox as mentioned above is sufficient.\n", "Q: \"nvidia-304-updates\" vs \"nvidia-304\" (and similar)? What is the difference between these two modules? Whoever created them didn't seem to think of including a clear description.\n\nA: You can research which Nvidia driver you need at: Unix Drivers | NVIDIA\nIf you click on the 304 link, you find information about the driver and the Supported Products tab lists the cards that need this driver. Find your card and you will know which driver you need.\nIf you look up the package names in Software Center or Synaptic, you will find the url to that same Nvidia page in the package description and you will see the driver version that the Ubuntu package is providing. \nThe difference between nvidia-304 and nvidia-304-updates is the Nvidia version (and perhaps the version of Ubuntu patch of that number) that it points to. \nIn general, the updates package will point to the newest revision by Nvidia and the package without updates in the name will point to the previous stable version. The exact relationship, however, may vary by Ubuntu release. \nFor example, at the Nvidia driver page, you can see that 304.108 is called \"the Latest Legacy GPU version\". It was released August 8, 2013. A link to the archived drivers shows that the previous version was 304.88, released on April 2, 2013.\nSo, in 13.10, 304-updates currently refers to 304.108 and 304 currently refers to 304.88\nIn general, you will want the updates version since it will point to the newest driver. But exactly what you need depends on the exact model of your card since the newest features in the driver may not work with your card. \nIn addition to the Nvidia number, the Ubuntu developers patch the driver, so the actual binary version to install contains the Nvidia number followed by the Ubuntu version number.\nIn 13.04 and 12.04 both packages refer to 304.88, but to different Ubuntu-patched versions. For example, in 13.04, 304 is 304.88-0ubuntu1 and 304-updates is 304.88-0ubuntu2. Information about the Ubuntu version can be found in Launchpad.\nSo you see that the actual binary file that the nvidia-304 and nvidia-304-updates packages will provide to your system will change over time. You can see this easily by viewing the changelog. 304 now points to 88, before that to 84, before that 64, etc.\nA little research or experimentation may be needed to determine which each driver you need and it may change over time. On my laptop with an older Nvidia card, as the version numbers changed I had to go from 304-updates to 304 because 304-updates began to point to a newer version of the driver that caused problems for my card.\nA note based on comments:\nThese version numbers assume that you are using the versions of 304 and 304-updates provided by the standard Ubuntu repositories. It is possible to replace the standard repository for these packages with PPA's (Personal Package Archives). One commonly used PPA is xorg-edgers, which provides bleeding edge versions of the drivers. Someone may choose to use this PPA if they need or want a version of the driver that is newer than the one offered by the Ubuntu release they are using. \nHere's the important point for the meaning of the 304 and 304-update packages (and others) after a PPA like that has been installed: they no longer have the same meaning. If you install 304 from xorg-edgers, 304 will now point to the newest driver provided by xorg-edgers and the relationship built into the package name structure will no longer hold. Additional Drivers will still report the the package name as 304 (because the package name hasn't changed). Nvidia-settings will report the actual version of the binary that it sees, in this case a non-standard 108. It doesn't know (or care) that the binary came from a PPA, not the standard repository.\n", "Q: trying to install 13.10 on Hipstreet Equinox2 tablet Not sure how to install on tablets I'm 13.10 on desktop so do I download a different ver for tablets \n\nA: Installing Ubuntu touch on tablets should be the same as phones.

All of the above did not work -- there was nothing in the blacklist.\nProblem Solution:  It turns out my partition /dev/sda8 was listed in /etc/fstab as the swap partition.  lsblk -f showed that /dev/sda6 had a label of 'swap' and the FSTYPE was 'swap'.  Not sure how this happened.  I edited the /etc/fstab file (sudo vim /etc/fstab) and changed swap to /dev/sda6;  saved the file and exited the editor.  Then in the 'disks' application / GUI I selected the /dev/sda8 partion and then clicked on the small right-facing triangular button below the Volumes partition (on the left).  The partition immediately mounted and an icon was automagically added to the Unity Launcher.\nHow I figured this out:\noutput from lsblk (note:  lsblk -f is easier to type)\nO=(--Excalibur---~$   lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT\n\nNAME   FSTYPE LABEL       MOUNTPOINT\n\nsda                       \n├─sda1 ntfs   Data        /media/steve/Data\n├─sda2 ntfs   OS          /media/steve/OS\n├─sda3                    \n├─sda5 ext4               /\n├─sda6 swap   swap        \n├─sda7 ntfs   Data        /media/steve/Data1\n└─sda8 ntfs   User        /media/steve/User\nsdb                       \n└─sdb1 ntfs   Backup_4TB  /media/steve/Backup_4TB\nsr0   \n\nI was fooling around in the 'disks' GUI (go to the Launcher, type 'disks') and trying to mount /dev/sda8.

When I log on using ssh to my server start firefox there, ideally it should start firefox on that machine. However, it is starting firefox on my machine and not the cliet. Why this is happening?\nI am logging in to the server with\nssh -X username@ip\nafter this just firefox\n\nA: With the -X flag you are enabling X11 forwarding. That means when the ssh server is configured the same...\n# cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep X11\nX11Forwarding yes\nX11DisplayOffset 10\n\n...you are forwading the window from the target machine to your local machine. So firefox IS started on the target machine, BUT it is displayed on your local machine.\n\nA: When firefox starts (on the remote system), it wants to use the X server to display itself. It finds the X server to use through the DISPLAY variable in it's environment. By using the -X option on your ssh command, you're telling ssh to set the DISPLAY variable in your remote session to forward the X connection back to your local X server (\"forward ...back?), so the firefox on the remote system displays on your local system. \nTo verify, execute pgrep firefox on each system, or even pkill -9 firefox.\n", "Q: I was trying to make a switch from Unity to KDE, and now my laptop hangs on boot I recently asked how I could remove Unity after installing KDE (used kubuntu-desktop), and was told to run a long apt-get command that boiled down to \"purge these Unity packages and make sure kubuntu-desktop is installed with a reinstall\".\nI ran it and restarted, and now my laptop hangs up when I boot.

Now in 13.10 I am no longer able to install the ia32-libs package which contains several dependencies that Matlab uses. Matlab uses a Java installer so dpkg is no help.\nHow do I meet these dependencies in Ubuntu 13.10 and later?\n\nA: The way I got it to work was to follow the instructions here. After running the command:\nsudo /media/MATHWORKS_R2012A/install -glnx86 -v\n\nif there are unmet dependencies it will complain about some library not found. Next, search for this library in Ubuntu's packages for your release (in this case saucy). Make sure to search the contents of the packages.

I figure since I am already entering one password I could automatically login skipping the login password, however, this option does not seem to exist anymore. Is this feature gone or is it disabled because of the encryption or what?\n\nA: Encrypt my home folder\n\nThis option provides you with an added layer of security. Your home\n  folder is where your personal ﬁles are stored. \nBy selecting this option, Ubuntu will automatically enable encryption\n  on your home folder, meaning that ﬁles and folders must be decrypted\n  using your password before they can be accessed. \nTherefore if someone had physical access to your hard drive (for\n  example, if your computer was stolen and the hard drive removed), they\n  would not be able to see your ﬁles without knowing your password.\n\nIf you choose this option, be careful not to enable automatic login at a later date.\nIt will cause complications with your encrypted home folder, and will potentially\nlock you out of important ﬁles.\nSee Page 18 of the Ubuntu Manual.\n\nA: Alright, just found it.

If it says Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe, then it's using your CPU instead of your GPU. If it's says it's using the Intel GPU, then you'll want to disable that in the BIOS and make sure your video cable is connected to your GPU.\nRadeon HD 8570M is a GCN/RadeonSI graphics card so you will want to go to AMD's website and download/install Catalyst 13.11.\n\nA: Don't believe the AMD card is enabled in the BIOS.

I have a macbook pro at home and I really enjoy being able to use the workspaces feature on ubuntu to increase my productivity. As myself being someone that isn't very familiar with doing command line things and hasn't worked with linux a whole lot other than doing basic commands like cd, ls, rm, screen, and sudo. I was wondering what you think would be the best choice for a ubuntu version. I am looking for ease of use as well as stability. I spend most of my time working with eclipse, as well as writing documents.\nOn a side note, right now I have a pretty high end workstation, but I am using a crappy notebook 2.5 inch 1TB hard drive for my system. Would it be worth it to switch to a top of the line SSD, or would the difference not really be noticeable? How difficult would it be for a newcommer to setup the system with the os and important folders running on a SSD and then other folders for storage running on a HD.\n\nA: If you want stability and support you can use 12.04 LTS as it stands for Long Term Support and it'll be supported untill April 2017 nevertheless Ubuntu 13.10 not, but if you want to experience newer features and possibilities of Ubuntu then you can use 13.10 version but again you may experience some troubles with this version in work as it's not the LTS version and being improved from time to time, the next LTS stable version of Ubuntu is Upcoming in Spring 2014. How to install Ubuntu you can read over here and what partitions you'll be needed to work with over here\n\nA: Regarding the best choice for your ubuntu version, that depends on your processor. Anything after 12.04 is much more resource intensive, but you shouldn't notice on a newer machine. That difference caused problems for me though on a five year old laptop. If your computer can handle it, get 13.10. \nWith a newer machine, the difference will not be huge with an SSD. SSDs do get better boot time however. Whether or not it is worth it depends on how much money you like to put into your computers (I prefer none, and will always opt for software solutions). Traditionally, no linux distro is very heavy on processing power. Personally, I would not think it worth a hardware upgrade. \nIt would not be too difficult, though I would do it using Mac's partition editor. NTFS support in linux is still not the best.  \n\nA: I am a power user. As a commercial artist and designer I have worked on Mac, Windows and many flavors of Linux. Currently I work with Ubuntu 12.04 and am divorcing the others. Ubu is 1000% better at working with Mac an Windows than they are at working with Linux. \nNon-technical background is not a problem. The current versions of Ubu are as user friendly as any OS. It is more flexible, more beautiful, and faster than the others. If you want to do just about anything on your computer just google it and find software suggestions and installation instructions. Power-user software is free except for donating what you feel it is worth. \nProblems are easier to resolve because of the communities behind them. Since it is not proprietary there are no secrets that hide solutions from the public and experts. I am considering upgrading from 12.04 to 13.10 because I have upgraded to 64-bit. It is new so 12.04 and Windows 8 are a little quirky on it. Since Ubuntu and other Linux flavors are currently ahead of MS to the point where MS has returned to \"borrowing\" I totally expect 13.10 to do better.\nIf it weren't for 64-bit I would stick with 12.04 LTS because adapting to change does slow down production. I am still keeping 12.04 on all my other machines. I hope that answers everyone's questions on upgrading professionally.\n", "Q: Why are there so many devices in /dev? I read that your devices are listed in /dev. I do not have nearly as many devices attached to my system as there are listed in that directory. Why are there so many devices there? And how do I get informations about a particular one?\n\nA: Not every device in /dev corresponds to a physical device. The devices in /dev also include pseudo-devices allocated by the kernel which allows the kernel to interact with these abstractions using standard IO as if they were ordinary files. Here is the device list as it appeared in the 2.6 kernel which also provides some details for each (pseudo)device.\n\nA: /dev lists block and character devices the kernel has drivers for, but\n\n\n*\n\n*not all the device pseudo-files are necessarily physically present\n\n*some devices such as network cards don't have nodes in /dev\nTo see what devices are actually present you're better off using something like the lshw command.\n", "Q: How do you preseed an ssh key? I tried this:\nd-i preseed/late_command string mkdir -p /target/root/.ssh\nd-i preseed/late_command string cp /cdrom/id_rsa.pub /target/root/.ssh/authorized_keys\nd-i preseed/late_command string chmod -R go-rwx /target/root/.ssh\n\n(I'm using a USB installer and I put id_rsa.pub in the root directory of the USB drive.)\nThe /root/.ssh directory is not created and the installer complains that the chmod command failed (not surprising if the directory doesn't exist).\n\nA: I believe you can only preseed one late command. And you must specify in-target before your commands.\nSo put your commands on one line, separate them with a ; before each command and add in-target.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 Sound Problem after following weird commands After launching a few commands :\necho autospawn = no >> ~/.config/pulse/client.conf  #use ~/.pulse/client.conf on Ubuntu <= 12.10\nkillall pulseaudio\n$LANG=C pulseaudio -vvvv --log-time=1 > ~/pulseverbose.log 2>&1\n\nMy sound does not work.

To get a usable Graphical interface, I used the shift+alt+F12 key combo to turn off desktop effects (they're on by default).\nThen I went to the K menu->System->Additional Drivers program and activated one of the proprietary driver options for my video card (uses nouveau by default on fresh install).  Once it was finished the item showed a yellow icon so I rebooted and things seem to be displaying properly once I've turned desktop effects back on.\nSince you did an upgrade you may already have a proprietary driver in place, you may need to remove, reboot, then re-install it.  NikTh seems knowledgeable in figuring this out if that's the case.\nHope this was helpful.\n", "Q: Ubuntu optimus support? When will Ubuntu (or a Linux kernel) have native nvidia Optimus support?  Estimates?  Weeks/months/years?\n\"Native nvidia optimus support\" as in when I run a graphically-demanding application, my nvidia graphics card will automatically kick in (like in Windows).  Or at least a way that I could click some button to turn my GPU on for when I want to run any game.\nI heard somewhere that Manjaro allegedly had native optimus support; is this true?  If so, is there a way to implement this in Ubuntu?  \nI'm running Bumblebee right now, yes I know what it is and what it does, but it's extremely impractical.  I can't game on Linux with this.  You have to start applications via command line/terminal, and usually most modern games aren't just one function (ie: when you call on the \"game\", it's really just a loader/splash screen, that calls upon other functions; and when the secondary functions are called, they're not optirun'ed).\n\nA: check out this post.\ni don't know about \"native\" support but there's already some drivers that support Nvidia Optimus.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/nvidia-releases-linux-graphics-drivers.html\n\nA: Since you already know what Bumblebee is and What it does and how it works. Will only answer one of your questions.\nI heard somewhere that Manjaro allegedly had native optimus support; is this true? If so, is there a way to implement this in Ubuntu?\nThe Answer is no.\nManjaro has inbuilt bumblebee support. You still need to use prmusrun or ptirun to launch your games from command line.\nLinux has a different Graphics Stack than windows. It has evolved over time and become exceedingly complex. Moreover because of a small market share, Companies like Nvidia are not ready to invest time and effort in supporting Optimus out of the box. Hence we do not have out of the box Optimus support.\nMost likely things are going to stay like this for a long time, Unless Mir comes along or Wayland makes its way into the Dektop. May be with a different display server things become a bit easy to work with.\nAs of now Bumblebee is the only workable solution on Linux.\n", "Q: Selling customized versions of Ubuntu My question is next: \"Can I modify some version of Ubuntu Linux, add some software related to electrical engineering, modify look and some functions of Ubuntu, basically customize the entire system so it suits the needs of electrical engineers working on the field or in the office, and then that customized system sell in order to make profit?\" \nI'm not sure am I allowed to do that (is it legal?), so I would appreciate answer. \n\nA: Generally speaking, yes, but there are legal conditions and other things to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most of the licenses in use are GPL2+. The rest are more permissive. Distributing GPL software (and modified LGPL software) requires you publish (or offer to publish) the source of that software to the people you're distributing to.\n\n*What other licenses are you using? Are your electronics applications redistributable?\n\n*\"Ubuntu\" is a registered trademark so if you want to use its name in your derivative product, you're probably going to need permission. See Canonical's IP policy. Notably:\n\nAny redistribution of modified versions of Ubuntu must be approved, certified or provided by Canonical if you are going to associate it with the Trademarks.\n\nYou probably could rebrand Ubuntu as Dino-Linux without permission, and that would be fine. There have been grumbly noises about stripping all mention of Ubuntu from unlicensed derivatives, but there have also been statements saying that's unnecessary.\nSeeking professional guidance, or explicit permission is probably your best bet here.\n\n*Post-install drivers (Nvidia binary, etc) are not free software. That's why they're not installed on the CDs. If you add those to your respin, you'll hit legal issues.\n\n*You cannot stop or enforce an EULA (et al) stopping somebody from trying to redistribute your distribution without paying money. That's the point of GPL. What's free stays free. A client could buy a single copy and legally use it for all their installs.\nAgain, you may need to think how your extra application fits into this bundle. It doesn't have to be GPL but you may need to jump through hoops to keep the licensing faeries happy.\nThat all said, I am not a lawyer. Even if I was, I wouldn't stake my legal reputation on having the full picture from your short description. Consider what I've said, make any changes you need to and then go and talk to a professional software licensing consultant or lawyer.\n", "Q: All my files are gone I am new to ubuntu, i tried to install it from a usb drive created by LiLi in windows, now when i reboot and start installing ubuntu, i did not get \" install alongside windows 8 \" option for a reason, i rushed things in and created Logical drive over the drive that has windows 8 on it.\nAfter installed ubuntu successfully, everything is gone, my partitions , even the recovery partition.\ni am not asking to do all the work for me, i really tried couple of things, but before processed , i want to know if there is a hope for me or is it completely gone!?\n\nA: There is hope for you.

Preferably one that also covers GRUB/bootloader problems that come afterwards.\nA few additional details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Motherboard does have UEFI.\n\n*I've disabled Secure Boot and Fast Boot.

This really shouldn't be an issue for EFI-mode installs, but if the reports are correct, it is. (I've not tried to verify this myself.) Thus, you may have no choice but to use the \"Something Else\" option for partitioning. You could check this question and answers for general guidance on that issue. Alternatively, perhaps you could back up and delete one partition before proceeding, but without knowing what the partitions are, I can't recommend a specific one to delete. Certainly you should not delete the EFI System Partition (ESP) or the Windows C: drive. Recent versions of Windows also like to have a Microsoft Reserved Partition, which is normally empty but should not be deleted.\nIn terms of EFI-mode installation, my Web page on Linux EFI-mode installs covers the basics, but it's not Ubuntu-specific and it's not a step-by-step guide. The Ubuntu wiki has a UEFI page that may also be helpful.\n\nA: Thanks for your help everyone, I have my laptop booting both Win7 and Xubuntu cleanly now.\nHow did I do it?\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled Secure & Fast Boot, enabled CSM, removed the Platform Keys and enabled Legacy Boot (even though I don't think I ultimately needed it)\n\n*Made sure to install the two ISO's to separate USB's using the Rufus tool using the default settings but making sure the \"Partition Scheme and Target System Type\" option was set to GPT partition scheme for UEFI computer\nNOTE: If you've already cleaned your HDD, see if you can borrow someone else's machine\n\n*Once done, boot from the Windows USB in UEFI mode and install\n\n*Once that was done, I set up Windows how I wanted (programs and updates), after I was satisfied I used the diskmgmt.msc tool with two defragging utilities (PowerDefragmenter & another tool that acted as a frontend for Contig) in several loops until I successfully shrank the C:\\ drive down to 100GB (Watch out for AVG's vault files, they're stubborn) NOTE: DO NOT USE GPARTED FOR THIS STEP, IT MESSES WITH WINDOWS\n\n*Rebooted, booted into a Xubuntu live session in UEFI mode (make sure you're greeted with a black and white screen) and started up the installer\n\n*Bit the proverbial bullet and used the \"Something Else\" option, highlighted the unallocated space and hit the + button, chose how large I wanted the partition (100GB), left most of the options at default (Beginning of Space, Ext4 Journalling Space & Primary partition (GPT can handle it)) and set the mount point to / Hit OK\n\n*Created a 5GB swap space\n\n*In the dropdown menu on the Installion Type menu, SELECT THE EFI PARTITION FOR BOOTLOADER INSTALLATION and go through the install\n\n*Once done, reboot and you should be greeted with the GRUB menu\n\n*Windows will boot fine through the \"Windows Boot Manager\" option (it was the third option for me, also, Windows might run CHKDISK, just let it)\n\n*Xubuntu WILL boot, but not through the first option, go into the \"Advanced Options\" (second option for me) and choose the non-recovery mode option and Xubuntu will boot fine\n\n\nThus far I have everything working as I want, after I'm done with this post, I'll be booting into GParted and filling the remaining ~200GB with either a NTFS/FAT32 partition to act as a shared storage partition between the two.\nThanks for your help again guys. With any luck, the only other time I have to deal with this again is if I get a new laptop.\n", "Q: Enable line numbers in gedit I can't find how to enable the line numbers, current line highlight, and other goodness in 13.10.  \n\n\nA: *\n\n*The fastest way to enable/disable displaying line numbers in Gedit is by clicking the downward pointing triangle ▾ in the lower right corner of Gedit where it shows LnXX, ColXX to show the dropdown menu in the below screenshot.\n\n\n*Check/uncheck the Display line numbers checkbox to toggle displaying line numbers. This action is temporary. It will not display line numbers the next time you open Gedit, so you can use this feature to quickly show the line numbers to find a line in a text file without permanently changing Gedit's preferences for all files. \nIf there are files open in multiple tabs in Gedit, checking the Display line numbers checkbox will only affect the file in the tab that has the focus. This action will not affect the files that are open in other tabs.\n\nA: It should be there in the Edit, Preferences dialog!\n\nAnd this is gedit version 3.8.3\n\nThere has been a similar issue reported over at ubuntuforums.org. The problem apparently arose when Unity's global menu was removed (by sudo apt-get remove indicator-appmenu). The solution involves using dconf editor to restore menu items or restoring the global menu.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is specific to gnome users, but I was able to get to the preferences by clicking up the top, like this:\n\n\nA: If you've removed indicator-appmenu to remove global menus then either \n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall indicator-appmenu or\n\n*run this command (one long line):\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides '@a{sv} {\"Gtk/ShellShowsAppMenu\": <int32 0>}'\n\n(If the above doesn't copy as a single line, this code box here will work).\nIf you've edited gedit.desktop to add an env to keep menus in their window then remove the env, typically env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=.\nAs an aside: if one wanted the app menu present in a root nautilus browser then removing indicator-appmenu and running the above from a root prompt will achieve that.\nExample:\nsudo -i\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides '@a{sv} {\"Gtk/ShellShowsAppMenu\": <int32 0>}'\n\n", "Q: Recommendations for New Ubuntu User? I just installed Ubuntu and I'm wondering if there is anything you recommend I do?

Your audio drivers may be out of date. If the driver isn't present, you may have to install it manually.\nAs for getting started, you'll find ubuntu contains many basic apps and utilities already(such as LibreOFfice, which is kind of like Microsoft Office, if you installed Ubuntu from ubuntu.com\".\nIf you want to be able to use Windows apps on Ubuntu, check out Wine.\nIn the case you want to have remote access, there is SSH.

I am using a Radeon 6770 connected via HDMI to my TV but under sound settings there is only analog or digital options. I would greatly appreciate any help to fix this issue.\n\nA: Try the below code in terminal  \nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nEdit the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nto \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"radeon.audio=1\"\n\nRun:\n sudo update-grub\n\nRestart the system\nAlternatively, and if this does not work, consider installing the proprietary driver for your ATI graphics card.\n\nA: Run the following and reboot\nsudo sed -i 's/LINUX_DEFAULT=\"/LINUX_DEFAULT=\"radeon.audio=1 /g' /etc/default/grub\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should enable HDMI audio which may be disabled by default.\nAlso, I would advise adding the oibaf PPA for the latest optimized open source drivers for your GPU:\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers; sudo apt-get update; sudo aptitude upgrade -y; sudo aptitude dist-upgrade -y; sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg-video-all -y\n\n\nA: Your Radeon 6770 is only a graphic or video card as I could check. If you have a desktop, which I think you are using now, the PCI where you connect the HDMI device would work only in a video device. In order to get a good quality sound you need a sound card, and since you are using an HDMI cable, you will also need separate speakers. In my case, I have it connected to my TV via HDMI but I have a Craig speaker with bass using the regular output sound, even thou my MB is equip with 5.1 sound. \n\nA: In my case this was due to the fact that upgrading introduced a new volume control interface that conflicted with the old one (which is still installed). Clicking on the sound indicator in the panel and choosing Sound Settings got me this controller:\n\nIt was showing HDMI selected, and sound being output, as above, but no sound was coming out of the speakers. In the last tab, I had the option of setting HDMI to 'off', as in this screenshot:\n\nDoing so switched the sound over to analog, and I got sound from the speakers. (I've got dual input on my speakers; they're connected directly to the computer with the analog output, and to the TV I use as a monitor, which is receiving the HDMI output.) Then I went to System Settings --> Sound, and discovered that the old interface (the one that the sound indicator linked to in 13.04 and earlier) is the one that showed up, as pictured below:\n\nIn this settings dialog, analog output was selected. Since I had set HDMI to 'off' in the other interface, I no longer saw the HDMI option. Turning HDMI back on in the first interface and rebooting brought back the HDMI option, and selecting it restored HDMI sound. So my guess is that one interface had HDMI selected while the other had analog selected, but that's just my guess.\n\nA: I have a Samsung Laptop R620 and I had no sound. When I installed 13.10 (upgraded from 12.10). Sound settings only displayed built in speakers which operated under test okay.  Then tried wav file which did not work.  Missing codecs.  Loaded Rhythmbox with all the codecs selected and low and behold I now had HDMI sound output under sound settings as well as built in speakers.  Checked both wav file and HDMI ouput and okay.  Had to select they required one.  I think that there is a little glitch in the installation procedure.\n", "Q: /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1 is not ready or not present This is frustrating as heck, I moved away from Windows 7 OS because of issues, errors, and such and was sold to Ubuntu because it was supposed to be reliable, and now errors and issues right after installing 12.04 with /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 and then got 13.10 to replace it, hoping issue was gone and now it's still here anyway but different message reference. \nI only have ONE hard drive, it's 1TB and it only had Windows 7 on it and was never really used at all.

The file was overwritten when I reformatted my hard drive. There are now 2 keys under my name registered on the site. I can prove I had access to the key, but I need to know where to ask for removal, or even if it's possible.\n\nA: There is no way to delete keys from key servers. You could revoke it with a revocation certificate created in advance or access to the private key (to create such one), but never delete a key.\nWell, theoretically you could, but you'd have to convince each single administrator of one of the hundreds of OpenPGP key servers to do so, and if somebody uploads it again it will reappear and redistribute. Most of these administrators will refuse anyway.\n\nTo prevent loosing access to your key, do following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Regularly backup your computer (important anyway).\n\n*Create an offline copy of your private keys.\n\n*Create a revocation certificate immediately after creating a primary key. Store it both in a digital way and print it on a piece of paper (I recommend something like gpg --gen-revoke | qrencode to be able to scan the certificate without the hassles of OCR).\n\n*Create a second copy and hand it to somebody you trust.

But it seems to work more like a touchpad. i.e. the touch inputs are scaled over the entire available display space.

I installed the Ubuntu Touch on my Galaxy Nexus by flashing it thru recovery, but I can't transfer files from my computer to it. Right now I'm in a Windows environment (Windows 8) and I don't want to install Ubuntu just to transfer files. Is there something I can do to transfer them (besides using adb push)?\nRight now my computer detects my Ubuntu Touch phone like this:\nhttp://puu.sh/4X9Mb.png\nhttp://puu.sh/4X9Mn.png \nIf I try to create folders inside this folder or try to paste anything it says I don't have permission. Is there something I'm missing?\n\nA: Perhaps the easiest way that comes to my mind is to enable SSH (no adb, no developer mode) on your Ubuntu Touch device and transfer your files using WinSCP\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch on Nexus 7: Why No ld-linux.so*? Short version:\nInstalled Ubuntu Touch, and noticed that there's no /lib/ld-linux.so.3 dynamic linker (symlink or otherwise).  First time I've seen this missing from a Linux installation.  Is there any particular reason it isn't there?\n\nLong version:\nI just installed Ubuntu Touch (13.10, stable) on a first-gen Nexus 7, and I want to try some ARM-targeted compilation on it.\nI installed the gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi package on my Ubuntu desktop (12.04, incidentally) and compiled a simple \"hello world\" in C, then copied it over to the Nexus, ssh'd in, and ran the executable (nexustest).  The response was:\n-bash: ./nexustest: No such file or directory\n\nUltimately I found that this was because Ubuntu was failing to even load the ld-linux.so dynamic linker.  As per usual on a non-statically-linked Linux executable, ldd nexustest shows that it's looking for /lib/ld-linux.so.3, and the Ubuntu Touch installation doesn't have that.\nI can \"fix\" this with either of the following, in which case the \"hello world\" runs as expected:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copying or symlinking /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 to /lib/ld-linux.so.3 -- suggesting that ld-linux-armhf.so.3 is the right dynamic linker\n\n*Compiling (linking) the executable with -static -- suggesting that arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc is using the right linker/arch\nFrom the GCC and Linux linking perspective, everything seems to be working as expected, except that there's no /lib/ld-linux.so.3 on my Nexus 7 (which I expect should just be a symlink to ld-linux-armhf.so.3).  Why is that?  Is the omission a mistake, or some intentional distro-design decision that I'm just not getting?\n\nA: The Ubuntu Touch builds use the armhf ABI, an architecture which gives significant performance improvements on newer ARM chips.  The cross-compiler which targets this ABI is the gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf (hf for \"hard float\") package, rather than the gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi package.  This armhf cross-compiler is available in 12.04.\nYou should not symlink /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 to /lib/ld-linux.so.3.  The linkers have different names precisely because they're used for libraries that have different calling conventions.  A \"hello world\" might work ok, but programs will start to fail in mysterious ways as soon as you use any code that needs to pass floating point numbers as arguments to a function.\n", "Q: How to configure bash to print exit status for every command? Every command run in bash returns with an exit code.\nWhenever I type a command on bash prompt, I want it to show the exit status, i.e., echo $?\ne.g., if I run echo \"hello\"; on bash prompt, the output should be:\nlinux@linux$ hello\nlinux@linux$ 0\n\n\nA: Here is a simple example:\nPS1='$? > '\n\nIf using double quotes, then you have to add a backslash to escape the $:\nPS1=\"\\$? > \"\n\nOutput:\n0 > echo 'ok'\nok\n0 > bogus\nbogus: command not found\n127 > \n\n\nAn even better way is to only print the exit code when it is non-zero.\nPS1='${?#0}> '    # single quote example\nPS1=\"\\${?#0}> \"   # double quote example (requires extra backslash)\n\nSample output:\n> echo 'ok'\nok\n> bogus\nbogus: command not found\n127> \n\nExplanation: ${var#pattern} is a bash parameter expansion that means remove the shortest matching pattern from the front of $var. So in this case, we are removing 0 from the front of $?, which would effectively truncate an exit code of 0.\nIf using double quotes, $? would be substituted when PS1 is set, instead of being evaluated each time. Do echo $PS1 to confirm you don't have a hardcoded value in PS1.\n\nA: The exit code from the last executed command is stored in the $? environment variable. So you just can add this variable to the default command prompt and you will always have the exit code printed there. The prompt is stored in the $PS1 environment variable. It is initially set in the /etc/bash.bashrc script and later in the $HOME/.bashrc.\nSo edit the line in $HOME/.bashrc (/etc/bash.bashrc would be system wide) from it's default value:\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\nto this (for example):\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w[$?] \\$ '\n\nSo the default prompt in changed to:\nuser@host:/path/to/dir[0] $\n\nThe 0 in the brackets is your exit code, see:\nuser@host:~[0] $ ls\nuser@host:~[0] $ ls /root/\nls: cannot open directory /root/: Permission denied\nuser@host:~[2] $ ^C\nuser@host:~[130] $\n\nFor the meanings see http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html\n\nA: Another way that I picked from the Arch Wiki was to use trap:\nEC() { echo -e '\\e[1;33m'code $?'\\e[m\\n'; }\ntrap EC ERR\n\nEffect: \n$ ( exit 1 )\ncode 1\n\n$ some-non-existent-command\nsome-non-existent-command: command not found\ncode 127\n\n$\n\n", "Q: Cut column from list How can I  cut second column from the following list from terminal?  \n56    267  \n57    235  \n58    255  \n59    283 \n\n\nA: If the data is in a file called test.txt, awk '{ print $1 }' test.txt will do it. \n\nA: If the space between columns is a Tab character, then\ncut -f 2\n\nwill do what you want.

When I start it from terminal I get this error:\n$ gnome-tweak-tool \nWARNING : Shell not installed or running \nWARNING : Error detecting shell \nTraceback (most recent call last):   \n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtweak/tweaks/tweak_shell_extensions.py\", line 199, in __init__\n    raise Exception(\"Shell not running or DBus service not available\") \nException: Shell not running or DBus service not available \nINFO    : GSettings missing key org.gnome.nautilus.desktop (key computer-icon-visible) \nWARNING : Shell not running \nNone \nINFO    : GSettings missing key org.gnome.mutter (key workspaces-only-on-primary)  \nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nI had a look with dconf-editor if I could just add the missing key, but apparently keys aren't meant to be added \"by hand\". \nSo how can I fix this?  I'd rather prefer not having to reinstall everything. \nWhich package is broken, can I just reinstall that?\nEDIT:\nI found by being root gnome-tweak-tool no longer crashed so possibly a permission issue somewhere. I don't know that I changed any permissions. \nAnother related problem, actually the reason I noticed the problem at all, is that unity-tweak-tool seem no longer to want to save the values edited.  I normally just have the Unity launcher on the primary display but wanted to check what it was like having it on both. I didn't like it so I went into unity-tweak-tool to set it back - but regardless how many time I tick \"only primary display\" it never changes anything. What does the Unity-tweak-tool actually change and can I do this directly somehow?  \n\nA: After long and arduous plodding around I finally came across CompizConfig Settings Manager, and after even more time fiddling with that I found a setting under Advanced Search > Ubuntu Unity Plugin > Launcher > Launcher Monitors, which was set to \"All Displays\". When I switched it to \"Primary Display\" it instantaneously removed the launcher on the second display, as it should.  Victory, finally!\nNow I expected whatever was broken to have been fixed, but alas, if I go back to Ubuntu Tweak tool and set it to all displays, I again can't set it back to primary only, but need to again resort to the CCSM to fix.\nI guess I found a bug. :/\nOh and as for the Gnome Tweak tool, it still just blinks and disappears.  I don't really care, seems CCSM can do everything both of the others should but can't do.\n", "Q: How to install \"intel graphics driver installer \" in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS? My system specification is as follow:-\nMicroprocessor  2.6 GHz Intel Core i5-3230M\nVideo Graphics  Intel HD Graphics 4000\nI want to install graphic driver provided by intel for linux.\nNeed help regarding installation of drivers.\nThanks.\n\nA: The official Intel Linux Graphics Installer is now no longer supported for 12.04 (support for 13.04 will end when 13.10 is released).\nNear the bottom of this link, it is said that: \n\nUbuntu* 13.04 was released in late April 2013. Support for Ubuntu* 12.04 effectively ended when the Intel® Linux* Graphics Installer version 1.0.1 was released (20 May 2013).\n\nUnless you have a specific reason for using the latest drivers, your system should work fine with the default drivers.\nThe Intel Linux Graphics Installer for 12.04 is no longer supported and using it is discouraged.\nThe 12.04 repo could be manually added (it's still hosted here), but it will not be updated to the latest version and may be removed without notice. Adapt the instructions here if you still want to use the outdated 12.04 repo (not recommended).\n\nA: You can download and read the installation instructions/details for Intel's graphics drivers (for Ubuntu 12.04) from here.  \nThe direct download link is here.\nBe careful when installing, track the changes you make during installation (because any changes in packages may cause problems for your U12.04).\nThe reason why Intel's graphics drivers installer is not available for 12.04 is that the insaller requires updated GLib whereas in 12.04 a legacy version of GLib was available only.  \nAlso there are many dependency issues in 12.04 <-> Intel Graphics Drivers Installer 1.0.xx , however version 1.0 works fine.\n", "Q: Mount error: \"unknown filesystem type 'exfat'\" When trying to mount an exfat filesystem, I get the following error:\nError mounting /dev/sda6 at /media/gkp/Backup: Command-line \n`mount -t \"exfat\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid\" \"/dev/sda6\" \"/media/gkp/Backup\"' \nexited with non-zero exit status 32: mount: unknown filesystem type 'exfat'\n\nExfat is used on some USB sticks and camera sd cards. What can I do to mount this type of filesystem?\n\nA: You get this error because the exfat filesystem is not installed in Ubuntu by default. exFAT is proprietary and patented by Microsoft.\nUbuntu 13.10 or higher\nSince Ubuntu 13.10, this package is in the main repository. Just install exfat-fuse and exfat-utils:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install exfat-fuse exfat-utils\n\nUbuntu 12.04\nFor ubuntu 13.04 and lower, you'll need a ppa to install the exfat support. Installation procedure:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:relan/exfat\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fuse-exfat\n\nIf you see the error gpg: \"tag:launchpad.net:2008:redacted\" not a key ID: skipping during the apt-add-repository step, then you'll need to manually install the signing key and run the apt-get update and apt-get install steps after that:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 4DF9B28CA252A784\n\n​​​​​​\n\nA: As of November 25, 2019, this does not work yet in Ubuntu 19.10 Eoan, probably because apt just cannot grab exfat-fuse. I fixed this problem by downloading exfat-fuse deb directly.\nThis is after installing a dependency.\n", "Q: apt-get update stuck at 100%[Waiting for headers] at \"Hit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/universe Translation-en\" Not sure what has happened to my Ubuntu 13.04 server. It is pretty much a LAMP & SAMBA server only, no other apps installed, no shell, command line only.\nI run an apt-get update a fortnight ago and it all worked fine. Today I notice another set of updates available so I try again, and I keep getting stuck at:\nHit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security/universe Translation-en\n100% [Waiting for headers]\n\nEvery time it stops there.

Any suggestions are really welcome.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: This might be a temporary problem with the mirror. I also can't reach the mirror at the moment of writing. Launchpad lists mirrors in Australia. Most of them are in a good shape and you could also choose them. The Ubuntu Wiki also has a page on Australian apt mirrors.\n", "Q: How can I get a user account back? With all my computers I make one partition for the root and another for /home. This is useful for disasters where I need to reformat the root for ubuntu, but leave my /home data untouched.\nWith the upgrade to 13.10 I had troubles on my wife's computer so I reinstalled 13.10. My own /home files came up, as expected, as if nothing had happened. For my wife, it is a different story - and that is the part where I need help.\nIf I go into Files, computer I can see the home directory. There I can see ilan (my files) and yona (my wife's files). I can open yona, documents and see all her work. This means that all is well and I just need to hook up to her files.\nSo the problem is that I need to create a user called Yona or yona, but something which will get me to exactly the files of interest. I'm not sure if I created her account as standard or an administrator. Is there any way I could tell by looking at the files in /home?\nI created a new user called Yona as a standard user (hoping that this is the right guess). The account came up as disabled. I pressed on the disabled button so I could change the password. I put in her password but it was refused as too short. Too short, too short, but that is what was used and that is what I need.\nCan anyone help me before my wife comes home and shoots me?\nThanks,\nIlan\n\nA: If you have created a user with login Yona whereas it previously was yona, then you can correct this by opening a terminal and typing:\nsudo usermod -l yona Yona\n\nIf yona logs in and doesn't get to her files, then you can subsequently set the correct home directory using:\nsudo usermod -d /home/yona yona\n\nTo solve the issue with the password, open a terminal and type\nsudo passwd yona\n\nand you can set yona's password without the system complaining. Note that this may first ask for your password, then twice for Yona's new password, like this:\nilan@machine:~$ sudo passwd yona\n[sudo] password for ilan:              # here enter your password\nEnter new UNIX password:               # here enter her new password\nRetype new UNIX password:              # here enter her new password again\n\nIf the files in Yona's home directory all seem to have a strange numeric owner, you'll need to change Yona's uid a/o gid to what it was on the old system, thusly:\nsudo usermod --uid ### --gid ### yona\n\nwhere you substitute the appropriate numbers at the ###.\nNext time when restoring the system, I would recommend creating Yona's account not via the GUI, but using the adduser command, substituting the appropriate values:\nadduser --home /home/yona --uid ### --gid ### yona\n\n", "Q: cannot boot ubuntu 13.10 with my usb, Can i change the kernal on my laptop to run it?

Other applications work fine as far as I can tell.\nA brief search on the internet suggested to (require 'iso-transl) to .emacs.

If something went wrong, please post the output of the commands.\nEdit: If it's a wireless network interface (it's a bit tricky):\nJust go sure it's up\nifconfig wlan0 down\nifconfig wlan0 up\n\nYou should see your wireless network interface with the command\niwconfig\n\nIf it is recognized as a wireless interface, you can scan the network with (assumed that your wireless interface is wlan0):\niwlist wlan0 scan\n\nThen establish a connection to the essid:\niwconfig wlan0 essid \"youressid\"\n\nSet the connection password:\niwconfig wlan0 key s:yourpassword \n\nHope you get an ip:\ndhclient -v wlan0 \n\nSet the default route and the name servers as above.\n", "Q: Intel Centrino 7260 after kernel update After every kernel update, will I need to redo everything from the answer here?\nThe reason I ask is because last night the kernel update but the wifi no longer works unless I load the previous kernel.\nWill this be a perpetual problem with updating?\n\nA: Yes, you must follow the steps for each kernel upgrade, fortunately they can be scripted and you can add any script you want to /etc/kernel/postinst.d/ to be executed after each kernel update.\nAnother option would be to build a small script and put it in your /etc/rc.conf to check for the kernel module and build it if not present during boot, something like:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmodule=\"iwlwifi\"\ncheck_module=$(modinfo $module 2>/dev/null)\n\nif [ check_module != \"ERROR: Module $module not found.\" ]; then\n    echo \"FAILED: $module not present in your kernel.

First I also thought that the problem was MongoDB so I updated the version on the bootstrap node. But what solved the problem is having the right DNS settings on the node that you are running the juju-core because it is using FQDNs when connecting to nodes. So, make sure that you can ping the bootstrap node using the FQDN. \n\nA: Like isein said, your issue can be related to the DNS resolution for this specific domain not happenning on your MAAS server.\nIn order to test this you can put a line in first place inside your /etc/hosts file :\nnameserver <IP address you are using for managing DHCP/DNS on MAAS>\n\nI managed to resolve the same issue than yours by this mean.

Read this wiki\n  page and/or this article for more information.\nMake sure that the virtual desktop is not greater than your laptop\n  screen. With the --pos option of xrandr you can then mirror parts of\n  your screen to the projector, e.g. for a 1600x900 laptop screen and a\n  1024x768 projector at position 100,100:\nxrandr --fb 1600x900 --output VGA --mode 1024x768 --pos 100x100\n\nFor a dual-head presentation, you can also use the following tools\n  (depending on the format of the presentation you uses):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*pdfpc\n  \n*pympress\n  \n*LibreOffice Impress (perhaps also OpenOffice  Impress)\n\n", "Q: Mysterious > prompt from missing right apostrophe If I type for example\ngrep 'needle\n>\n\nI get sent to a mysterious > prompt from which ctrl-C (or restarting the terminal) is seemingly the only escape.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is this prompt?\n\n*Why doesn't it terminate when I enter ctrl-Z?\n\n*Why isn't it better designed to detect trapped newbies?  Sure, maybe in some ridiculously contrived edge case there would be a reason to open this > prompt and then input something like \"quit\\nexit\\nhelp\\nCTRL-Z\\nlogout\\n\", but if the user starts entering those things, Ubuntu should at least issue a helpful response message (e.g., \"Are you trying to get out of this prompt?  If so use CTRL-C.  If not, ignore this message.\") that wouldn't interfere with whatever weird purpose the prompt serves.\n\n\nA: This is because you opened a quote (\" or ') so the shell assumes that the command in continuing, what is indicated by this > character. So until the closing quote you will get the > prompt to finish the started command.\nThis is when you want to echo something with newline in it, for example:\nuser@host:~$ echo \"this\n> is a text\n> with multiple\n> newlines\"\n\noutputs:\nthis\nis a text\nwith multiple\nnewlines\n\nTo abort you can also hit Ctrl+c.\n\nA: There is nothing mysterious. That prompt (>) is suggesting you that the shell is waiting for second quote ' and a filename to finish your command. If you want to search for 'needle then use:\ngrep \\'needle filename\n\nAnd Control+Z is used for suspending a job, but you don't have any job started only  by entering grep 'needle.\nAnd, at the third point, I would say that this will sound ridiculous for users who really work with the terminal. Plus: how do you thing that the terminal could detect if someone is newbie or not? And what if someone really wants to enter those strings: \"quit, exit, help, logout\"?\nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to use 'grep' with characters like * and _?\n\n*What's different between Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+C in Unix command line?\n\nA: The prompt is just the standard input. the ' character is interpreted as 'start of a string' so it excepts for a closing '. when you press return before the closing ' it is interpreted as a newline. you can continue writing what you want. when you type a ' and press enter it gets the whole string you wrote\n", "Q: Grub Rescue - the laptop won't boot First of all I'm Italian, so I apologize for my bad English.\nSecond, I have a big problem.

You can use the following instruction if you want to keep stick with Xampp. My suggesion is using bitnami lampp you can choose here location of your installation. so in this way you can install lamp in anywhere and doesn't need permissions everytime.\nhttps://bitnami.com/stack/lamp\nTo make bitnami lamp behave like Xampp do the following changes:\nTrack every changes instantly: \n\nTo disable PageSpeed, uncomment by removing '#' the following lines in your\n  httpd.conf (installdir/apache2/conf/httpd.conf)\n\n   #Include conf/pagespeed.conf\n   #Include conf/pagespeed_libraries.conf\n\n\nTo disable OPCache, change opcache.enable in your php.ini file and set\n  it to 0 (installdir/php/etc/php.ini\n\nDo some other changes (such as showing error in php):\n\nopen installdir/php/etc/php.ini and change all values to devolopment values\n  to do this read the comments in that file.\n  \n\nDefault phpmyadmin username for bitnami lamp: root\n\nA: Dude, you can move the lampp folder to the root of the partition then mount the partition to the ubuntu's /opt folder like this in terminal: \"mount /dev/sdb4 /opt\" or if you have other software folders in /opt such as wine or whatever, you could move all the contents of the lampp folder to the root of your partition then create a folder in /opt called lampp and run the following in terminal: \"mount /dev/sdb4 /opt/lampp\".\n", "Q: Struggling with commands in Xterm I am absolutely struggling with the cp command and the moment and I would like to know where to just learn all the usefull commands.

You will then be able to copy paste the files anywhere easily. It is just that vulnerable files are located in placed other than the home directory, altering which may lead to an unusable system. Hence this extra step must be taken, i.e. giving root privileges using the command sudo. Also note that nautilus should be replaced with thunar, dolphin, pcmanfm in case you are using xubuntu, kubuntu, or lubuntu respectively.\n\nA: You can use the Nautilus file manager to copy files. That should be on your launcher. You don't have to use the terminal.\n", "Q: E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

It supports ASF, FLAC, M4A, Monkey's Audio, MP3, Musepack, Ogg Opus, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True Audio, WavPack and OptimFROG audio files. All versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all standard ID3v2.4 frames are parsed. It can read Xing headers to accurately calculate the bitrate and length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2 tags can be edited regardless of audio format. It can also manipulate Ogg streams on an individual packet/page level.\n\nThere isn't (yet) an Ubuntu package for it, but you can install it via\npip install mutagen\n\nYou'll need to install pip if you don't have it already. You can install it using virtualenvwrapper if you want to avoid the need for sudo and avoid possible confusion with the standard Ubuntu package mechanism when it comes to security updates, versions of dependencies etc.\nOr you can download and install mutagen manually from here.

Where is the problem, is it GRUB or rEFIT? \n\nA: After a lot of searching for solutions, I also found myself in similar situation. AndrewM's solution did not work for me either. The Mac is on pure EFI (non-hybrid), pure 64 bit Linux.\nA couple points to make: 1) There are two projects, rEFIt and rEFInd.  2) You can install both and I have found that they will detect each other and let you boot one from the other.\nHere is what finally got me back into Linux after Mavericks upgrade...

Now at least I can get into Linux and rework the GRUB and look at EFI configurations.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I removed refit and installed rEFind.

How I can copy the information with out the superuser rights OR how I can charge the permissions for selected folder and all files and folders included in it?\n\nA: You have to change the permission and also own the permission for the folder to which you want to access.\nFollowing command will help you:\nsudo chown -R saurav:saurav /home/user\nsudo chmod -R 777 /home/user\n\nWhere saurav is the user to which you want to own the files and /home/user is the example of the user accounting you want to access.. You can change saurav to your user's name and /home/user to the user account that that you've created.  You can also use this if you want to access files and folders of multiple users:\nsudo chown -R saurav:saurav /home/user /home/user2\nsudo chmod -R 777 /home/user /home/user2\n\nand so on..\n\nA: I recommend the following, assuming the files you want to copy are inside a folder called \"backup\" for example, do the following where this folder resides:\n sudo chmod 777 backup -R\n\nWhere chmod 777 will give Read, Write and Executable permissions to all files inside this folder to all users in this PC, saving you from having the problem you just mentioned. The -R at the end will make sure all files, sub-directories, in a recursive way will get the permission change.\n\nA: In my experience, there is no way to gain access to that data without elevated permissions.  If you have sudo (I am assuming you do since you ran sudo nautilus) or root access it is quick and easy as the other two posts have mentioned.  \nWithout elevated permissions, I don't know of any \"right\" way (meaning without breaking in and changing the root password) to get the data.  Nautilus is just the file manager and will not change the set perms.\n", "Q: I cannot seem to install wubi on windows 8.1 Pro (Surface Pro 2) I just bought Surface Pro 2 (with Windows 8.1 Pro) from the store yesterday and tried installing wubi (right before them) and ran into some boot up issues.

If you don't know there is a list online, google it...\nYou must own the router. ;-)\nIf there is no firewall block - strange - run form a console sudo nano /etc/hosts and remove any line with wordpress inside.

For example my ping fails on wordpress.ICMP Ping is good only for well known servers!\nBut, tracepath shows that no intermediate server receives your ping, and this is strange, because after your router the ping gets lost but continues to \"hop\"... are you using the network of your factory? If it's it, you can be behind a blocking intermediate server and you will need to use a proxy.\nIf this isn't you case, let's continue by ignoring tracepath (the path changes always, but your network path appears to be faulty).\nDo a next step and try to do from a terminal wget wordpress.com and after that ls -lh: if you see an index file in html format which is greater than 10kb (may change in future) the problem is in your web browser (bad extensions or misconfiguration), if you don't, try other two times.\nIf you get a good index file (try to open it with a browser by double-clicking it) and you can see the webpage, simply disable ALL extensions in your browser and after that reinstall it.\nIf you can't get a good index file the problem is in your network.\nHere the hard procedure if you didn't solve:\n\n*\n\n*Disable any proxy set in your browser and remove any instance of Tor\nand Privoxy, or of other distributed anonymous network systems.\nReinstall them later if they aren't the problem, they are good for\nyour privacy.\n\n*If it doesn't work change the DNS in your router (not in your PC) to Google DNS (in Google we trust & we find the DNS ip) and try. SUGGESTION: leave the Google DNS, they are always good.\n\n*If it doesn't work let's do a last check you can try to use a transparent proxy (anonim are slow) to re-route your traffic to wordpress: if it goes a server in the newtork hop path is faulty or your ip range is banned. If it doesn't function you may have a block inside your network.\nIt's the best I can do with the information you left, good luck. Let me know. :)\nPS: a suggestion, for a proxy list search on google and pick a proxy with LOW ping and HIGH uptime.\n\n\nA: What happens if you use wget from a shell to access the site? If that works and downloads the index page, then it's a problem with your browser.\n\nA: I couldn't find any permanent solution to this particular problem. But thanks to @Lorenzo, I resolved to use a selective proxy system for the websites I couldn't access on Ubuntu. \nI'm using Tor-browsing + AutoProxy on Firefox.

I've seen it before so I know you can. \nTried running Remmina  but its not letting me connect. \n\nA: I think it is impossible. You can access Windows's files and run some software using Wine.\nYou cannot run your installed Windows from Ubuntu.\n\nA: What you're asking is not possible. (Usually)\nThat said, it may be possible to load your windows partition in Virtual Box. \nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/\nYou can install Virtual Box from the Software Center in Ubuntu and create a new virtual machine that uses the windows partition of your hard drive rather than a virtual hard disk. However this usually doesn't work because windows will detect that you have changed your core hardware configuration and will simply not boot. There's quite a few more reasons this will probably not work, but I'll stop there unless you want more detail. :)\nYou can still access the files on your windows partition. This is rather easy to do, just open the file manager in Ubuntu and you will see your windows partition on the left side of the screen. Your files from windows will be in there somewhere based on what version of windows you have installed. \n", "Q: execute a shell script when USB is connected I am working on an application which deals with all kinds of USB storage devices(such as taking backup, updating DataLogFile etc) \nMy problem is :\nI want to write a shell script which is stored in this USB drive(As usb is at center of my project so USB is going to be same but PC's will change) AND this script should be executed as soon as the USB drive is connected to my Linux system.I will not need any kind of \"root\" or \"sudo\" permissions for other tasks which I am going to do in this shell script.\n\nA: Use the udev rules described in the other question to run a local script. The local script can look for a file on the newly-mounted device and execute it.\n(That's kind of risky for security if you think about it.)\n", "Q: ip address configuration in ubuntu 12.10 \n*\n\n*I am unable to edit /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf file with vi editor.

(It should look like a little computer, Wi-Fi symbol, or a set of up/down arrows) In the menu that pops up choose \"edit connections\". Then enter your information in a manner similar to Windows.\nIf you're using server, and have no graphical interface installed you might try  sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces and sudo nano /etc/resolve.conf\nControl + O will write the changes and Ctrl + X will exit.\nHope this helps.

To check if machine has an adobe poscript, print out a configuration page, look for printer language, you should see adobe poscript 3 if not then you will need to purchase one through your copier vendor. \n\nA: I just had this same problem on my printer and it appears to be a driver issue.

This is the case with my W520 (see the blog post here). Bumblebee is designed primarily to render graphics on the nvidia card and output them on the laptop display through the intel card, not to drive external monitors with the nvidia card. Probably the most simple work around is described here (not sure if it will still work on the T430 and the intel driver included with the latest version of ubuntu though).\nYou may be able to use the VGA port (that was the case with the 420), or you may be able to switch to using the nvidia card for both the external and thinkpad displays in the BIOS menu.

On my development machine (Ubuntu 13.04 desktop), I can run the following, which produces the same blocks:\nwkhtmltopdf http://google.com google1.pdf\n\nWhile this prints out the pdf properly:\nwkhtmltopdf --use-xserver http://google.com google2.pdf\n\nMy version of wkhtmltopdf is 0.12.0.\n\nA: In fact wkhtmltopdf on linux requires quite a lot of Xorg as mentioned on the project page:\n\n(Linux) No longer requires an XServer to be running (however the X11 client libs must be installed) \n\nYou should install the client libs as well.\n\nA: This bug report suggests that wkhtmltopdf just needs whatever xorg-x11-fonts provides:\n$ wajig list-installed xfonts\nxfonts-base\nxfonts-encodings\nxfonts-mathml\nxfonts-scalable\nxfonts-utils\n\nSo try installing those. Note that you'll pull in several X dependencies, but not the server itself.\n\nA: If you are using PdfKit on Lambda, you will have to setup ENV variables as:\n\"FONT_CONFIG_PATH\": '/opt/fonts/' \n\"FONTCONFIG_FILE\": '/opt/fonts/fonts.conf'\n\nAlso see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46486261/include-custom-fonts-in-aws-lambda\nIf this problem is in the local environment, a fresh installation of wkhtmltopdf must resolve this.\n", "Q: Trouble Updating to Version 13.10 (from Version 13.04) By trying to update to Version 13.10 (German) from Version 13.04 i'd received the following Problem-Message:\nW:Fehlschlag beim Holen von \"http: //de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty-backports/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\"\nW:Fehlschlag beim Holen von \"http: //de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty-backports/restricted/source/Sources  404  Not Found\"\nW:Fehlschlag beim Holen von \"http: //de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty-backports/universe/source/Sources  404  Not Found\"\nW:Fehlschlag beim Holen von \"http: //de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty-backports/multiverse/source/Sources  404  Not Found\"\nE:Einige Indexdateien konnten nicht heruntergeladen werden.

The issue seems to be that the \"natty-backports\" repositories are not working properly. If you disable them the problem gets solved.\nTo do so, edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list directly.\nFrom a terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\nthen comment out the two lines that contain \"natty-backports\". Lines 34 and 35, I think.\nSave and try running the update again.

I've written a custom application indicator, which isn't working properly on saucy.\nThe menu is initialised with a few items, then updates regularly, adding or removing menu items.\nThis worked fine <13.10, but on 13.10, the line that adds the menu to the indicator produces the following warning:\nWarning: /build/buildd/glib2.0-2.38.0/./gobject/gsignal.c:2475: signal 'child-added' is invalid for instance '0x24390e0' of type 'GtkMenu'\nself.ind.set_menu(self.menu)\n\nAnd the items added to the menu subsequently dont appear.\nA bug has been filed against several indicators for the same problem, but it's not clear to me whether this is a problem with the indicators as a result of an API change, or a bug in the GTK or Appindicator libraries.  Does anyone know?\n\nA: TL;dr: It is a bug. Below are the reasons why it's a bug.\nThe bug was marked as Triaged, meaning: Yeah, we acknowledge there is a problem. We will try to fix it when we have time. The bug is filled against libappindicator source.\nAs can seen in comment 8 the bug is reproducible. So, yeah, everyone is able to see the problem, and will be looking for a solution, or a workaround (adhoc solution).\nHere is a briefing of what status means:\n\nTriaged:\n\n*\n\n*A member of UbuntuBugControl believes that the report describes a genuine bug in enough detail that a developer could start working on a fix. (also see tip below)\n\n*Use this when you are confident that it should be looked at by a developer and has enough information\n\n\n\nA: I've been investigating this bug further today and I found that even though adding menu items does not work, removing them still does.

It does not start the service after stopping it. So it has the same effect as sudo stop myapp.\nDoing sudo stop myapp and then sudo start myapp works fine though. Wondering why restarting behaves different.\nI'm on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: There is a bug in upstart. It still exists in Ubuntu Raring 13.04, but I haven't tested Saucy or later yet. \nBasically, pre-stop should be avoided. It causes undefined state changes on restart. If you're using it to trigger the shutdown of a daemon, as in your case, it will just stop everything. In a more classical usage, even specifying a pre-stop script will prevent your main process from restarting (as demonstrated in the bug report). \nThe behavior of \"on stopping\" jobs seems to be unaffected, so one solution is to create a myapp-stop.conf job that is triggered \"on stopping myapp\". The only apparent disadvantage is that it's more difficult to know when all other potentially \"on stopping myapp\" jobs are completed.\n\nA: To expand on xdissent's answer (which worked for me), here's an example script you can place in /etc/init/tomcat-stop.conf. When the tomcat service gets stopped, this script runs and cleanly shuts down Tomcat before Upstart restarts it.\ndescription \"Tomcat Server shutdown script\"\n\nsetuid tomcat_user\nsetgid tomcat_group\n\nchdir /usr/local/tomcat\n\nstart on stopping tomcat\n\nkill timeout 30\nscript\n    exec bin/catalina.sh stop\nend script\n\n", "Q: Fixing failed upgrade to 13.10 When I start Ubuntu after it froze during an upgrade to 13.10, it says:\nFilesystem check or mount failed.\nA maintenance shell will now be started.

I.e., do\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nSee the linked answers for more info if this does not work.\n\nA: Ubuntu usually remounts a file system as read-only if it detects an error with said system (this is done to prevent further file-system errors). To fix this, I would suggest you reboot your system. When the bootloader comes up, select the \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\" option. Select a kernel in Recovery Mode (generally, the newest one on the list should do). Select the option to boot into a root shell. Once in the root shell, run fsck -f -y /, and and restart the system using either reboot, or shutdown -r now. If after this, you still get the same above error, you may have a failing hard drive.\n", "Q: Autokey not working in Saucy I have to become dependant on Autokey phrases to insert all kind of repetitive data. It was working fine when I upgraded from to 13.10 without formatting. However, I wanted to get rid of the clutter and unused junk and made a clean —read formatting- install. After installation and reconfiguration of Autokey it displays an odd but consistent behaviour.\na) Saving a new modification hangs the program. The window goes grey and I have to close it by means of a terminal.\nb) Phrases configured to trigger without a key are not working. Neither with a key trigger.\nc) A trigger key to show the window doesn't work.\nd) The program is configured to start at login and show an icon on panel. Neither function works.\nI've installed and reinstalled both versions (KDE and GTK) several times. None works OK.\nWhat really puzzles me is that it was working quite fine in Saucy just prior to my reinstall.\nHas anyone experienced anything like this? I really need a macro expander. Can anyone suggest an alternative?\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: Diving the net I've found two things: \n1) Autokey is basically unusable with Saucy -at least within Unity- and... \n2) It seems to have ceased developement since a year and a half ago. Thus, I NEED a replacement that works. Any input to that effect much appreciated. Anything that will insert my email or my access ID to some sites will do. TIA.\n\nEdit #2: Managed to get Autokey KDE working. How? I'm not truly sure. I installed it alongside Autokey QT and it worked. In the process, it (or maybe me) managed to mess up a lot of my home folder permissions which I had to fix (chmod -R) manually. It also broke Unity and lightdm which I had to restart from the command line. However, it's been working fine since then. The only gripe is that I haven't managed to make it autostart at log-in but that's minor. I'm probably not pointing the correct command to the autostart roster.\nClosing the question.\n\nA: I had a similar problem.\nIt seems that having a blank 'abbreviation' enabled will cause autokey to behave erratically.\nDeleting this extra blank 'abbreviation' seems to restore Autokey to an operable state.\n", "Q: Fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bits I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32 bits on my Dell Inspiron 1501 computer and I want to reinstall (not upgrade) the 64 bits version. I don't know how to do that. Wifi doesn't work with my current version of Ubuntu and I have heard that it could work with the 64 bits version. \n\nA: Just FYI, you cannot upgrade from a 32bit to a 64bit, the only way is to do a complete reinstall. (I know that's what you wanted anyway, but I just wanted to clarify for any other potential readers).\nYou install the 64bit just like you installed the 32bit. \nBe warned, all your files will be overwritten so make sure you back up anything you want to keep (unless you set up /home on a separate partition during the install of 12.04 32bit, in that case /home will not be touched during the install(you would have had to set this up manually it is not the default) Any programs that you installed will need to be reinstalled but see the lower part of my answer to see how to preserve any saved data(game saves and config customizations, etc)  As well as an easy way to save your documents(but save any important files in a regular backup just in case)\nTo install simply;\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the LiveDvd/USB containing the 64bit version of 12.04(download it from here if you haven't already(note the 64bit is selected by default))\n\n*Select \"Install Ubuntu\"\n\n*Select \"Replace Ubuntu 12.04 with 12.04)\n\n*Allow the installer to run and then reboot.\nYour new install of 12.04 64bit will be completed but if you have any proprietary video drivers you will have to reinstall then via the \"Additional Drivers\" program again.\nYou will also need to install ia32-libs and ia32-libs-multiarch:i386 so that you can run 32bit programs on the 64bot system.\n\nThe following step is not necessary of you have your /home on a separate partition and is optional in any case. For this to work, you MUST use the same profile(account) name in the new install that you used in the old or it will cause permission problems that may prevent you form accessing any of the files in your /home folder\nSince you are \"upgrading\" from 32bit to 64bit and not to a newer version, you should be able to just save you home folder to another drive and then move it back over without worrying about any conflicts with your program configs(as sometimes happens with regular upgrade). When pasting back to the new home just let the old files overwrite the new ones(a window will pop up asking you if you want to do that, just select the box to apply to all files and then click yes)  This will save all your saved programs states from you old system so that when you reinstall all the programs, the settings and any game saved will be restored. As well as any other files you have saved in you profile.\n\nA: For one, DO NOT install the restricted driver.  It crashed my Dell 1501.\nYou will have to install the driver that is provided by Ubuntu.

Did they move the xorg.conf file?\n\nA: The xserver.configfile for Ubuntu 13.10 is located at /etc/X11/xorg.conf .

Ok, this more than a question is a plea to explain this thing... I was trying to answer another question and I got tangled in a mess. Disclaimer: I am an old-time Unix/Linux user, maybe the technology has overtaken me...\nI have a standard 13.10 installation with two input method: normal US and US with international dead-key (this last one is the default - I normally write in Spanish, Italian, and English, often mixed). I haven't selected any input method, so I'm using the default input method... which I'm at a loss to understand which is. \nSo. I create the file .XCompose with the following content (don't ask): \ninclude \"%L\"\n\n<dead_acute> <z> : \"å\" aring\n<dead_acute> <Z> : \"Å\" Aring\n\nAnd restart the server. Now xterm, xjed, kile  let me write the angstrom unit \"Å\" with the dead accent and then Z, while gedit, gnome-terminal still give \"Ź\". \nI (think I) know how to modify the behavior via GTK_IM_MODULE (and co.) environment variables, but my question is oriented to trying to understand which is the default configuration --- what and where I have to change to have a consistent behavior across all applications.\nI know, another question that will earn me another Tumbleweed badge...\n\nA: The ComposeKey sequences used by Gnome to enter special characters are hard coded into the program, so your modified settings will work with X programs, and apparently KDE programs, but not with Gtk programs.\nSource: GtkComposeTable, which lists the Gnome compose key table. Gnome dead key settings are given at GtkDeadKeyTable\nMore information about using the compose key - and using xim to bypass the Gnome hardcodings - is given at ComposeKey in the community documentation.\nThe Gnome hard coding can be overruled in favour of the original Xwindow Input Method (XIM) by setting the environment variable GTK_IM_MODULE. This can be set in the /etc/environment file, but if the machine has more than one user then it is best set from the home directory on a per user basis by modifying ~/.gnomerc or ~/.Xsession\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=\"xim\"\n\nFor gnome-terminal, right click in the terminal window, and in the context menu choose Input methods >> X Input Method\nxim should be the default input method, but to make sure the default input method is being applied system wide, from System Settings >> Language Support make sure Keyboard input method system is set to default. This should make it so you don't need to right click the terminal window every time, but you will probably still need GTK_IM_MODULE environment setting.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows 7 - can't get back to Windows I installed Ubuntu 13.10 on a laptop already running Windows 7.

I was running Ubuntu on my PC, but after a recurrent issue now I can't boot either OS. I would like to install only Ubuntu on my PC and will make Windows 7 history for good, but I am a bit puzzled by the instructions for creating a bootable USB options on the website.\nIf I create a bootable USB on my Mac following the instructions for OS X, would it boot in a PC? \n\nA: *\n\n*You will need:\n\n*\n\n*A 4GB or larger USB stick/flash drive\n\n*An Apple computer or laptop running macOS\n\n*An Ubuntu ISO file. See Get Ubuntu for download links\n\n\n\n*To ensure maximum compatibility with Apple hardware, first blank and reformat the USB stick using Apple's \"Disk Utility\", but this step can be skipped if you intend to use the USB stick with only generic PC hardware.\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility from Applications -> Utilities or Spotlight search.\n\n\n*Insert your USB stick and observe the new device added to Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Select the USB stick device (you may need to enable the option View -> Show All Devices) and select Erase from the toolbar (or right-click menu).\n\n\n*Set the format to MS-DOS (FAT) and the scheme to GUID Partition Map.\n\n\n*Check you've chosen the correct device and click Erase.\n\nWarning: Disk Utility needs to be used with caution as selecting the wrong device or partition can result in data loss.\n\n\n*Install and run Etcher\nTo write the ISO file to the USB stick, use a free and open source application called Etcher. After downloading this and clicking to mount the package, Etcher can either be run in place or dragged into your Applications folder.\nBy default, recent versions of macOS block the running of applications from unidentified developers. To side-step this issue, enable App Store and identified developers in the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences. If you are still warned against running the application, click Open Anyway in the same pane.\n\n\n\n*Etcher configuration\nEtcher will configure and write to your USB device in three stages, each of which needs to be selected in turn:\n\n*\n\n*Select image will open a file requester from which should navigate to and select the ISO file downloaded previously. By default, the ISO file will be in your Downloads folder.\n\n\n*Select drive, replaced by the name of your USB device if one is already attached, lets you select your target device. You will be warned if the storage space is too small for your selected ISO.\n\n\n*Flash! will activate when both the image and the drive have been selected. As with Disk Utility, Etcher needs low-level access to your storage hardware and will ask for your password after selection.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n*Write to device\nAfter entering your password, Etcher will start writing the ISO file to your USB device.\nThe Flash stage of the process will show progress, writing speed and an estimated duration until completion. This will be followed by a validation stage that will ensure the contents of the USB device are identical to the source image.\nWhen everything has finished, Etcher will declare the process a success.\nCongratulations! You now have Ubuntu on a USB stick, bootable and ready to go.\n\nWarning: After the write process has completed, macOS may inform you that 'The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer'. Don't select Initialize. Instead, select Eject and remove the USB device.\n\n\n*Boot your Mac\nIf you want to use your USB stick with an Apple Mac, you will need to restart or power-on the Mac with the USB stick inserted while the Option/alt ⌥ key is pressed.\nThis will launch Apple's 'Startup Manager' which shows bootable devices connected to the machine. Your USB stick should appear as gold/yellow and labelled 'EFI Boot'. Selecting this will lead you to the standard Ubuntu boot menu.\n\nSource: Create a bootable USB stick on macOS\n", "Q: Mac HDD Is Encrypted I have the hard drive from a PowerMac G5, which was my old computer before it died and I upgraded to Ubuntu Studio.  \nThe hard drive its self still works well, but on Ubuntu I can't access most of the files.

I now have access to all of my music.\nThe problem, as it turns out, is that the disk is mounted as read-only.  I would love to figure out why, but I'm happy with the way it is right now.\nThank you to all who helped.\n\nA: As if from a Mac, it is likely to be formatted as hfsplus, which is a filesystem type used by Apple. This can have varying compatibility with Linux.\nIf it does not automount, try mount -t hfsplus /dev/sdX0 /EMPTY-DIRECTORY-WHERE-YOU-WANT-TO-MOUNT-IT in terminal. It may come up as read-only though. /dev/sdX0 is the name of your hfs+ drive, and the partition which you need to mount.\nWhen it has mounted run sudo nautilus /PATH/TO/WHERE/THE/DISK/HAS/MOUNTED/ and you should be able to read and write to it, so you can copy stuff off. After you have copied the files though, you will need to modify the permissions  of the copied files to access it with your normal user. You could do this is by using the file manager as root, by right-clicking and and then clicking Properties and then Permissions, or by using chmod.\nAfter you have copied the files you want, AND ARE SURE THAT ALL OF YOUR IMPORTANT DATA IS OFF THE DISK, you can then format it using GParted to a file-system like ext or FAT, and use it as a external hard disk.\n", "Q: \"E: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/htp could not be found.\" after removing the LAMP task So, I tried uninstalling the LAMP stack I had following the Ubuntu documentation for it.

The options available should be visible at the bottom of the screen when the computer boots up.\n\nA: If the disc is loaded before the computer starts (already in the drive) it should boot directly into the Ubuntu setup.\nHowever, depending on your type of machine, you may have to select that as the boot disk, by entering the boot menu.\nThe key to press as your computer starts up to boot menu can be different and vary from machine to machine (can possibly be any key from ESC to f12, as posted above).\n", "Q: \"Invalid command 'Order'\" after deleting /etc/apache2 I'm having a hell of a time setting up a dev environment for Wordpress. \nI messed everything up a couple weeks ago and this afternoon wanted to start over.\nI tried to reset Apache by uninstalling the package and deleting the /etc/apache2 directory.\nThen I reinstalled Apache2 and restored the directory with the command:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall apache2.2-common\n\nLocalhost navigates to the \"It Works!\" page, but Apache won't restart, which make me nervous.\nI keep getting this error: \nSyntax error on line 160 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:\nInvalid command 'Order', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration\nAction 'configtest' failed.\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n\n...fail!\nAny ideas? I'm just trying to get up a working LAMP set up.\n\nA: Apache is unable to restart due to the error in your configuration file. Did you edit apache2.conf by hand? Debug your syntax error in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and sudo service apache restart should start working correctly.\n\nA: The Order directive is provided by the mod_authz_host module, and by deleting the /etc/apache2 directory you've caused it to become inactive. You need to reenable that module.\nDeleting the whole directory is not a good way to start over, for two reasons: there are files in there owned by other packages, and because Ubuntu's package manager thinks your changes are intentional. apt-get install --reinstall will not clobber your config changes.\nIf you want to remove a package and all its configuration, the right way to do that is with dpkg --purge. Then, when you reinstall the package, you will get back to the default configuration.\nProbably the easiest way to recover from here is to purge all the apache2.2 packages. Then, reinstall apache2.2.\n(Another course is to use dpkg -i --force-confmiss /var/cache/apt/archives/apache2.2-common-*.deb to just restore missing configuration files, but that may not be enough if deleting the directory also broke some install-time configuration.)\n", "Q: How to make my own splash screen I'm trying to make a destro and I need to change the splash screen.

I went on Windows and deleted my single Ubuntu partition, hoping to be able to easily install 13.10 with Wubi like I had with 12.04, not knowing that the feature had been discontinued.\n\n*I then used Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.4.2.exe to put the image onto a 16 GB USB drive and booted from it.

For the limited number of package I looked at (e.g. apache), I found that the package version in the updates repository is always newer than or equal to the version available in the security repository (provided that they exist). This gives me the impression that all security patches posted to the security repository are also posted to the updates repository. If this is true, I can remove all <release_name>-security entries in my apt sources.list and the <release_name>-updates entries will still give me the security patches. This will speed up apt-get update quite a bit.\nThe best documentation I can found regarding the repositories is on the community help page\n\n  \n*\n  \n*\"Important Security Updates (raring-security)\". Patches for security vulnerabilities in Ubuntu packages. They are managed by the\n  Ubuntu Security Team and are designed to change the behavior of the\n  package as little as possible -- in fact, the minimum required to\n  resolve the security problem. As a result, they tend to be very\n  low-risk to apply and all users are urged to apply security updates.\n  \n*\"Recommended Updates (raring-updates)\". Updates for serious bugs in Ubuntu packaging that do not affect the security of the system.\n  \n\nHowever, it does not mention whether the updates repository also includes everything in the security repository. Can anyone confirm (or disconfirm) this?\n\nA: You are correct, when packages are pushed to the security repository for a given release, there is an automated process that also copies the security update to the corresponding updates repository. The reason for this is to reduce the bandwidth load on the security.ubuntu.com servers.\nHowever, the recommendation is to keep pointing your apt source.list at the security repo at security.ubuntu.com, but after the rest of your entries. The reason for this is that if you are using a mirror other than archive.ubuntu.com, it's possible that the mirror you're pointing at falls behind or is out of date with respect to the primary archive hosts. If that happens, apt will still pull important security updates from security.ubuntu.com. However, if the update is available on the other archive mirror and security.ubuntu.com, apt will pull from the repository that is listed earlier in the sources.list configuration file. As you point out, it does admittedly come at the cost of slowing down atp-get update a bit.\n", "Q: unmet dependencies while installing wine Hello I am new here and I have been trying to install wine:\n$ sudo apt-get install wine1.7\nReading package lists...

(Read more about this process here: https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/network-configuration.html)  This line is where the problem most likely is.\nBy default Ubuntu first checks the host file to see if the hostname has been manually specified there, and then it runs a minimal Multicast DNS query (this is used in zeroconf environments, Wikipedia has an article on it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS if you want to learn more), followed by a regular dns query, and then finally a full Multicast DNS query.\nIn corporate environments that don't have reverse DNS set up properly (which apparently is often the case) the Multicast DNS queries cause major slowdowns.  To fix the problem you should either fix reverse DNS or remove the Multicast DNS queries from the configuration.  Given that in a corporate environment you likely have a DNS server of your own, I'd recommend just getting rid of the Multicast DNS query option from the configuration.\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss-mdns/+bug/94940 for more information about this problem.\n\nA: Goto\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=58712\nand try the solution given by \"wonder\"\nIt worked for me.\n", "Q: Reset MAAS after loosing Juju configuration?

It gave me the error \"ERROR gomaasapi: got error back from server: 409 CONFLICT\".\nI went into the MaaS GUI and stopped the leftover machines, and then deleted all the nodes and had then go through the discovery and commissioning stages again, but I still got the same errors after all that!\nIs there a way to reset this?\n\nA: Deleting/clearing/recommissioning nodes will not clear out old Juju settings. This is because MaaS stores files, some of them including the Juju bootstrapped state.\nTo reset this, you need to run: \nmaas-cli login root http://<your_MaaS_server_hostname>/MAAS/\nmaas-cli root files list\n\nThis will list the files that have been stored on the MaaS server by Juju. See if any of the files listed have the filename bootstrap-verify or provider-state. If so, run the following commands to remove the files and reset the MaaS to being in an \"Non bootstrapped\" state:\nmaas-cli root file delete bootstrap-verify\nmaas-cli root file delete provider-state\n\nRun juju status. If it gives you an error that indicates it is not bootstrapped, simply run juju bootstrap and you should be good to go. If it gives some other error indicating that it thinks it's deployed but can't find a file or something, then remove the folder ~/.juju/environments/ (maybe back it up just in case), and then run juju bootstrap.\n(See the IRC logs where I found the solution.)\n\nA: in Ubuntu 14.04Lts with Openstack IceHouse I've resolved that removing the directory \"enviroments\" and \"ssh\" inside the path .juju/\nrm .juju/environments\nrm .juju/ssh\n\nand re-launch the commands\n$: juju sync-tools -e maas\n$: juju bootstrap --upload-tools -e maas --debug\n\n", "Q: gt 54om isnt being used when playing games so I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 and after looking everywhere on how to install steam, I download tf2 and its lagging and has no AA, so i check and im not using my real gpu, instead im using my intel integrated gpu, HELP!\n\nA: I suspect you need to install the relevant drivers for your graphics card.\nFollow this : https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/jockey-gtk/\nAnd good luck :)\n", "Q: What command to use to open sublime?

It't more like a static string.\nFrom man bash (somewhere at line 1984):\n\nAliases  allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as\n      the first word of a simple command.\n\nIn your case, execloc will never be the first word of a simple command.\nBut, instead to define execloc as an alias, you can define it as an environment variable:\nexport execloc='/home/user/'\n\nAnd then you can use it everywhere you want as follow:\ncd $exeloc/temp/somefolder\n\nA: I don't think so with bash/dash, but I could be wrong. I think it may be possible with 'zsh' (alias -g foo='bar').\nBut there are some other possibilities.\nIf you are just wanting more convenient 'cd' commands, you could use CDPATH (google it).\nOr use symlinks or hardlinks (man ln).\nOr modify/create ~/.inputrc with a line like:\nControl-f: \"grep -r -i    .\\e[D\\e[D\\e[D\"\nThis types out a grep command for me and then backspaces to before the dot so I can type ctrl-f and then a word I'm searching for.\n\nA: You can do it (if I read your question properly) as follows:\n\nexport EXECLOG=/home/user\ncd $EXECLOG/temp/somefolder\n\nBasically set up your substitutions in the shell and access them by prefixing them with the \"$\" sign.

I've got a bunch of hour-long videos I want to split out into 5-10 minute pieces.  So far I've simply used the openshot video editor to identify good splice points, and the blazingly fast avconv command-line program to copy out the actual audio and video without changing any formats or codecs.  Then it is easy to upload that to youtube via the google command-line tool.\nBut I'm looking for something to help automatically find the right splice points.  The video is mostly static slides with some real-time handwriting going on.  So e.g. a script that would process the video and give me timestamps for the major video transitions (slide transitions) would help a lot, especially if it could then back up and go forward from those transitions to eliminate silence.\nIs something like that available?\nAre other fast/easy video editing pipelines for this sort of work out there?\n\nA: You can do this with Kdenlive.

In the file I need to find a string and replace it with another string. Up to this fine. But how can I replace the string with another string along with format. I mean like Bold, Italic, Underline, etc. for new string. \n\nA: The only way I would know how to automate .doc files is with a very elaborate and extremely time consuming Python script. You would need to automate [Libre|Open]Office using PyUNO.\nThis is the best way to do this because you can use just about every function in Office without having to do dodgy hacks... \n\nA less ideal method would be using unoconv to convert the .doc to something human-readable like .fodt, then sed and the convert it back to .doc.\nunoconv -o test.fodt -f fodt test.doc\nsed -i 's/string/newstring/g'\nunoconv -o test.doc -f doc test.doc\n\nYou have to be careful that your string isn't going to interfere with the document tags. If it is, you'll need to use something a lot more industrial to make sure you're only editing things in <text:...> tags.\nSo instead of using .fodt, you can use html\nunoconv -o test.html -f html test.doc\nsed -i 's/string/<B>newstring</B>/g'\nunoconv -o test.doc -f doc test.html\n\nHowever, there is every chance the conversion will completely munch the document formatting.\n", "Q: how to view a doc from command line?

You have 1 Gig of RAM that can not be accessed. This can happen because of several things, but I would guess that the update updated video drivers and that your card is \"using\" part of that RAM. \nYou may want to check that your RAM is not \"marked bad\" with something like BadRam.\nFinally you may want to look (though I don't think this is it) to make sure the kernel isn't mapping RAM in an odd way. \ncat /var/log/dmesg | grep -a 40 \"BIOS-provided physical RAM map:\" \nshould get you started down this path. Though you may try just loading the older kernel if you did an update and see. \nBasically you need to figure out where the missing memory is.

If you want to know that , after connecting your SSD to Ubuntu machine type df -h there you can find your SSD /dev/ code. \nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX  # Example: sudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThis will rewrite the MBR information to point to the current installation and rewrite some GRUB 2 files (which are already working). Since it isn't done during execution of the previous command, running sudo update-grub after the install will ensure GRUB 2's menu is up-to-date. \n\nA: another option might be to clone the 13.04 with Clonezilla, then restore using Clonezilla to the SSD drive using a CZ boot stick/CD/DVD.

Nothing more.\n\nA: Use Ubuntu's command-not-found hook, as specified in Command Not Found Magic. It is currently used to suggest packages to install. Refer to /usr/share/doc/command-not-found/README which should be installed on your system.\nBetter yet, because it does not depend on the command-not-found package, (re)implement the Bash builtin command_not_found_handle to do an xdg-open if $1 is an existing file, and to delegate all other cases to the previous implementation. \n# Save the existing code for the handler as prev_command_not_found_handle.\n# Bit of a hack, as we need to work around bash's lack of lexical closure,\n# and cover the case when it is not defined at all.\neval \"prev_$(declare -f command_not_found_handle)\" >& /dev/null \\\n     || prev_command_not_found_handle () { \n            echo \"$1: command not found\" 1>&2\n            return 127\n        }\n\n# Define the new implementation, delegating to prev_handler.\ncommand_not_found_handle () {\n    if [ -f \"$1\" ]; then\n        xdg-open \"$1\"\n    else\n        prev_command_not_found_handle \"$@\"\n    fi\n}\n\nGood question, nifty feature.\n\nThinking it over some more: you might not like the feature as much as you think, unless you also extend the bash_completion handler. Imagine wanting to open file-with-a-long-name.txt, then setting \nalias o='xdg-open'  \n\nwill make (about) four key presses suffice:\no f<Tab><Enter>\n\nWhereas typing the full file name takes a tedious 26 - and that excludes backspacing over the inevitable typos.\n", "Q: 127.0.0.1:9051 doesnt work after apache, mysql, php installation? I have installed apache2, mysql, and php and now it doesn't let Vidalia run on localhost. I tried to change the TCP connection (controlport) to any other ip 192.168.0.40 and tried to change the default port 9051 to any other but that doesn't work.

The port 9051 is a control port which Vidalia uses to talk with Tor, while port 9050 is the SOCKS port where you should point your browser. I installed Apache, Tor and Vidalia and no problem arrises.\nVidalia and Tor should always communicate using localhost or 127.0.0.1. If localhost doesn't work, is probably because is preferring ipv6 and apache has nothing to do with it. In the control port type 127.0.0.1:9051 and restart the system. Don't autostart Tor yourself, Vidalia should bring Tor up when Vidalia starts. If you start Tor before Vidalia it will fail.\n\nA: I found this article https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/20906/why-cant-i-access-localhost-from-tor-browser\n\"\nCause localhost is local to your computer, Tor is a public network that routes your traffic around the world. The network connections Tor browser makes are not local. Tor will not attempt any connections to private networks, or localhost. The browser connection leaves your computer and goes through 3 Tor relays and finally to the destination. That exit node (which can be anywhere in the world) cannot access \"localhost\" on your computer since it has zero knowledge about the request, only the destination and the relay it needs to send the response back to. – drew010 -Feb 13, 2020 at 16:13\"\nAnd this one which explained why trying to re-configure tor is not recommended.\nExclude IP addresses - where has it gone?\nhttps://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/20854/exclude-ip-addresses-where-has-it-gone/20868#20868\nBottom line for me is use firefox for localhost on a seperate computer to my tor research machine.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Ping works , but unable to do ssh I disabled the firewall with sudo ufw disable, I can ping the server, the server can ping me but I can't ssh to it:\nroot@ubuntu:/home/acme# ssh 192.168.1.6 ssh: connect to host\n192.168.1.6 port 22: Connection refused\n\nI removed ssh and reinstalled :\nsudo apt-get remove openssh-client openssh-server\nsudo apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server\n\nBut still ssh is not working and I get the error\n\nconnection refused \n\nHow do I tackle this issue? \nHere are some other stuff I have tried so far:\nroot@ubuntu:/home/acme# sudo service ssh start\nstart: Job is already running: ssh\n\nroot@ubuntu:/home/acme# ps aux | grep ssh\nacme      6548  0.0  0.0  12576   320 ?

I'm looking for a \"personal\" equivalent for the /etc/fstab file, that apply only on my account (on login); does such a file exists? Or is it more complicated?\n\nA: No you can not. But it is not too complicated to do: all you need to do is create a script that manually adds the mount points you need and execute that script from your login. \nLets assume this is the fstab entry for a personal mount that you want only mounted if you login:\n# volume              mount point       type  options\nnews:/usr/spool/news  /usr/spool/news   nfs   timeo=14,intr\n\nthe manual mount could be:\nmount news:/usr/spool/news\n\nSo if you put this in a script (cd ~ && gedit mount_them.sh) and make the script executable you can add this script to your .bash_profile or .bashrc (.bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells).

So it renames grub2's shim file that has the Microsoft signing key to the Windows file name and you boot the Windows efi file from grub menu that has bkp at beginning of name.\nIf your want to undo rename. But if then you cannot boot you may have to add the rename again. May be best to have full backup of efi partition.\nTo undo & to rename files to their original names, you just need to tick the \"Restore EFI backups\" option of Boot-Repair. \n\nA: The easiest and safest solution is to ignore the \"Windows 8 (loader)\" GRUB entry and just use the ones that work.\nIf that offends you, you can try adjusting your GRUB menu entries. This is more complex than it should be, unfortunately. Googling a phrase such as \"adjusting GRUB 2 entries\" produces about a bazillion hits with information on this topic, but I haven't read them in enough depth to recommend any specific site. There is a GUI tool called GRUB Customizer that's supposed to simplify matters, but I've never used it, so I can't comment on how well it works.\nAnother option is to move away from GRUB entirely. In particular, my rEFInd boot manager is much easier to configure manually; however, when you first install it, it's likely to have more, not fewer, extraneous entries. If you want to remove them, you'll need to remove files in the /boot/efi/EFI/*/ and/or /boot directories or use the dont_scan_files and dont_scan_dirs options in the refind.conf configuration file to keep boot files out of the menu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 gives \"Package 'libapache2-mod-auth-mysql' has no installation candidate\" error UPDATE:\nBecause Apache 2.4 is the default version (instead of the previous 2.2) this error occurs.  However as can be seen here all future versions of Ubuntu 13.10 and above will not support this package until it gets fixed upstream.  As a work around you do not need to install this package as it is only required for Apache authentication against MySQL (as opposed to doing it at the web app end, which is far more common)\nI'm trying to install my LAMP environment on Ubuntu 13.10 using my script file that can be found here.

Now i'm wondering as to what can i do to atleast save my files from there and if there is a way of repairing it without losing all data on windows.\n\nA: Reinstall grub\nFirst of all you should be able to mount you' re Windows partition from Ubuntu to save you're data. To make you're Windows boot again I would boot the Windows recovery CD or the normal install CD and reinstall the Windows boot loader(there are instructions for all Windows versions just search in google). Then Windows should be bootable but you will have lost you're dual boot. Then reinstall then  \nOption 1: Find a bootable disk for reinstalling grub.\nOption 2:Ubuntu and place the GRUB boot loader at the right place by clicking \"something else\" in the Ubuntu installation when it gets to partitioning and select the right place for the boot loader. Know you should be able to choose what you want to boot on start up.  \nNote 1: There are several instructions for the stuff above on the internet if you get stuck.\nNote 2 :I'll maybe be able to give more help if you tell me which version of Windows you have.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu HDD clicks then shuts down i've had this problem with 2 PC's.\nwhen i install ubuntu, after a couple a days, my hdd clicks and only the hdd shuts doun. ubuntu freezes and theres no option but to force restart it. after the restar the problem repeats after a couple of minutes.\nwhat am i doing wrong? how can i fix this problem?\n\nA: You don't mean you tried the same HDD on 2 PCs right?

I installed Mint 15 (based on Ubuntu 13.04) after I switched of the secure boot in the BIOS, enabled CSM in the BIOS, disabled fast boot in both Windows 8 and the BIOS. During the installation, I decreased the size of the Windows partition. \nEverything worked well, until Windows 8 installed updates. Directly afterwards, I could only get into the BIOS and where the hard disk would not be visible at all.

However, every time I start windows, I have the same problem. Does anybody have an idea how I can fix that?\nThanks so much in advance.\n\nA: There are many people who have been able to successfully run Windows 8 with Ubuntu, but in my experience having tried several times, every time Windows 8 boots it seems to run some sort of \"fix\" routine that reclaims the laptop.  I'm sure Microsoft would say it is to help fix boot up problems since most users will never install two OSes.  I say though that it is Microsoft assuming that their OS is the only one in the world, and screw everybody else anyway :-)\nOn most of the laptops I used, we ended up wiping Win 8 out and installing it into a Virtual Machine.  VirtualBox and VMWare Player are both good ones.\n", "Q: Grant a user permissions on www-data owned /var/www I have a simple web server setup for some websites, with a layout something like:\nsite1: /var/www/site1/public_html/\nsite2: /var/www/site2/public_html/\nI have previously used the root user to manage files, and then given them back to www-data when I was done (WordPress sites, needed for WP Uploads to work). This probably isn't the best way.\nI'm trying to find a way to create another user (lets call it user1) that has permission to edit files in site1, but not site2, and doesn't stop the files being 'owned' by www-data. Is there any way for me to do this?\n\nA: If we check ownership of site1, we will find something like this,\nls -ld /var/www/site1/\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 24 21:06 site1/\n\nThis means that the directory is owned by user root, group root. While user root has write permission (plus read and execute permissions) to the directory, group root has only read and execute permissions.  \nWe will want to change the group ownership to another (new) group and add user1 to that particular group. We will give write permission to that particular group as well.\nCreate  a new group,\nsudo addgroup site1\n\nAdd user1 to the newly created group,\nsudo adduser user1 site1\n\nCheck that user1 is really in that group,\ngroups user1\n\nThe output should be a list something like,\nuser1 : <other-groups> site1\n\nNow we can change the group ownership of your intended directory.\nsudo chown -vR :site1 /var/www/site1/\nchanged ownership of `/var/www/site1/' from root:root to :site1\n\nGrant write permission to this new group owner,\nsudo chmod -vR g+w /var/www/site1/\nmode of `/var/www/site1/' changed from 0755 (rwxr-xr-x) to 0775 (rwxrwxr-x)\n\nCheck that all the changes are indeed there,\nls -ld /var/www/site1/\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 root site1 4096 Oct 24 21:06 /var/www/site1/\n\nSo, the directory now is owned by user root, group site1. Both user root and group site1 have write permission (plus read and execute permissions) to the directory. Any user belonging to group site1 will enjoy all the privileges granted to that group.\nNow login as user1, move to site1 directory and try to create a file in that directory,\necho \"My User1 Site\" > index.html \nbash: index.html: Permission denied\n\nThis failed since most likely the primary group of user1 is not site1. So, change to that group.\nnewgrp - site1\n\nTry to recreate the file (beware that you have been moved to the home directory of user1 after changing group), this should work now.\nSince the created files will have world read permission, apache (or your web server) should not face any problem accessing them.\nEDIT\nAlso, as pointed out by dan08 in  comment, you  need to add www-data to site1 group.\nsudo adduser www-data site1\n\nOn many (not all) distributions, www-data is the user under which the Apache web server runs. This also means that everything done by Apache (especially including PHP scripts) will be done with the permissions of user www-data (and also group www-data) by default. WordPress uses the user www-data to write files.\nIf you want to see how apache web server is running, issue the command,\nps aux | grep apache2 | less\n\n\nA: Create two groups: site1grp and site2grp\nsudo groupadd site1grp && sudo groupadd site2grp\n\nAdd www-data to both groups.\nsudo adduser www-data site1grp && sudo adduser www-data site2grp\n\nAdd user1 and user2 to the appropriate groups\nsudo adduser user1 site1grp && sudo adduser user2 site2grp\n\nChange the permission of your site folders so that the user owner is www-data and the group owner is the appropriate group\nsudo chown -R www-data:site1grp /var/www/site1  && sudo chown -R www-data:site2grp /var/www/site2\n\nNow www-data has the user and group permissions on both sites and each user has the group permissions for their respective site. \n\nA: You have to create a new group, for the, so called, \"new user\", and then add the www-data and the \"new user\" to that group:\nsudo gpasswd -a new_user new_group\n\nThen you can change the owner to new_user and group to new_group:\nsudo chown -R new_user:new_group /var/www/site1\n\nThen you will need to give group level access to site1. www-data will still be able to access the site, because it belongs to the new_group, while new_user will not be able to access site2, because he will not belong to the www-data group, which owns site2.\n\nA: For those who have their wordpress root folder under their home folder:\nUbuntu/apache\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your user to www-data group:\nCREDIT Granting write permissions to www-data group\nYou want to call usermod on your user. So that would be:\nsudo usermod -aG www-data yourUserName\n\nAssuming www-data group exists\n\n*Check your user is in www-data group:\ngroups yourUserName\n\nYou should get something like:\nyourUserName : yourUserGroupName www-data\n\nyourUserGroupName is usually similar to you user name\n\n*Recursively change group ownership of the folder keeping your user ownership\nchown yourUserName:www-data -R yourWebSiteFolder/*\n\n\n*Change directory to yourWebSiteFolder\ncd yourWebSiteFolder\n\n\n*Recursively change group premissions of the folders and sub-folders to enable write permissions:\nfind . -type d -exec chmod -R 775 {} \\;\n\nmode of /home/yourUserName/yourWebSiteFolder/' changed from 0755 (rwxr-xr-x) to 0775 (rwxrwxr-x)\n\n*Recursively change group premissions of the files and sub-files to enable write permissions:\nfind . -type f -exec chmod -R 664 {} \\;\n\nThe result should look something like:\nWAS:\n-rw-r--r--  1 yourUserName www-data  7192 Oct  4 00:03 filename.html\nCHANGED TO:\n-rw-rw-r--  1 yourUserName www-data  7192 Oct  4 00:03 filename.html\n\nEquivalent to:\nchmod -R ug+rw foldername\n\nPermissions will be like 664 or 775.\n\nA: Assuming all files already belong to www-data user (you can check it with ls -slah command) who belongs to www-data group (next column after username in list of files) you can just add you user to the same www-data group to allow editing these files\n# usermod -aG www-data username\n\nfor existing user, or\n# adduser username www-data\n\nfor newly created one\n\nA: However this all only works if the default permissions when creating new files include group write permission.  Default permissions on most (Linux) systems are to give write permission only to the file owner.  This means that if either www-data or a user creates a file or directory the other won't be able to write to it.\nI have puzzled over this problem for several years, the only solution I have come up with is to use ACLs and reset them for the whole tree at intervals.\n", "Q: Smokeping web front end on Ubuntu 13.10 I have upgraded a PC from Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 to 13.10.\nOn 12.04 the URL to Smokeping web front end used to be http://localhost/smokeping/smokeping.cgi.

between them. Is it actual keyboard input that triggers the appearance of the missing line, or does scrolling down e.g. with the mouse wheel do it? I've seen bugs like that before in g-t, the last one I think was to do with switching or creating tabs.\nExamples of similarly reported previous bugs:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-terminal/+bug/881014\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=695412\nI would suggest trying with a different terminal program (e.g. xterm), and perhaps using a different window manager or desktop environment (e.g. swap between unity and unity-2d), or graphics driver (e.g. swap between nouveau and the nvidia proprietary driver.) Actually chasing the bug in gnome-terminal down and getting it fixed is probably not very likely, sadly.\nI very much doubt missing packages are the cause.\n\nA: You've some residual configuration that should be removed. Also I suggest you to upgrade your system and re-configure the updated packages. So I want you to execute these steps once, I wish it would help you.\n\n\n*\n\n*First open software Sources to ensure that you'll be able to upgrade your system without any problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute sudo software-properties-gtk in terminal and go to Updates tab. Tick first two Check boxes, and in the same tab for Notify me of a new Ubuntu version, select: For long-term support versions. Then go to Other Software tab and Tick first four Check boxes. Except first four, either remove or Untick. Also be sure that in Ubuntu Software tab all check-boxes are ticked.\n\n*Then Close the Software Sources Window and execute this command to update your repository:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n*Now remove any residual config and others junked packages. Following commands will help you:\nsudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get remove --purge $(dpkg -l | grep \"^rc\" | awk '{print $2}' | tr '\\n' ' ')\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nI want you to go for 4th step first without going for 3rd step. If it works then you don't have to upgrade you system, ie, you can skip the 3rd step.\n\n*Follow command will help you to upgrade your system.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf you have finished this step, then also you've to go for 4th step. :)\n\n*These commands will help you to re-configure the packages installed. Execute these in your terminal:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -a\n\n This command would take some time around 3-5 minutes so wait. It will not give any output if executed successfully or else it will give the error message. Note down the error message if you get any.\nsudo update-grub && sudo initramfs -u\n\nThen finally restart your system once. Hope it would help you to solve your issue. \nReply if something goes wrong or you get any error at any particular command with describing the command and the error message.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 13.10 - Laptop Loses wireless after sleep I'm running Lubunu 13.10 on an hp G62 - I'm new to Lubuntu having used ubuntu previously, but I've made the switch as my laptop is now getting toward the lower end of acceptability, and I'm delighted with how well it runs.\nAnyway, I'm having an issue that if I close the lid of the laptop it won't reconnect to the wi-fi when I open it again, and I'm not sure how to even force it to scan for a network - I have to restart it at the moment - and then it always connects perfectly. The router is a BT Business Hub 2.\nAny help much appreciated - thank you.\nEDIT - at home it seems to re-connect with no issues to the router EE gave me - so it may be an issue to do with Lubuntu/the router at work.\n\nA: Please do:\nsudo gedit /etc/pm/config.d/config\n\nA new empty file will open.

After opening your lid and the network doesn't return, run:\nsudo nmcli nm sleep false\n\nI upgraded from Lubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 via update manager and started to have all these issues. Yesterday I backed up my data and did a fresh install (reformatted and installed). I am confirming today that this issue doesn't not happen anymore and a few others have \"gone\".\n", "Q: Remove drop shadow in nemo previews I recently started using Nemo because Nautilus has gotten pretty terrible. I quite like it, but one thing is still bugging me: the shadow of the preview of every image and video file (see below).\nI've been looking around in the /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/nemo.css file but couldn't figure out how to get rid of that shadow.\nIn Nautilus you get a border instead of a shadow, so surely something is different. I just can't figure out what.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT: I've found the .png file of the shadow here, on the Linux Mint github. No luck finding that file on my system though.\n\n\nA: Sorry, you're out of luck unless you want to recompile it yourself. nemo/icons/thumbnail_frame.png is made with automake's \"noinst_\" prefix which means the image is not actually installed. Instead, what happens is the image data is compiled into the nemo binary.\nIf you really want to go the route of compiling your own binary (NOT TESTED, TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK):\n\n\n*\n\n*First, remove nemo/icons/thumbnail_frame.png and also remove the reference to it in nemo/icons/Makefile.am\n\n*Install the prereq package gnome-common, which will give you gnome-autogen.sh needed for the next step.\n\n*Run autogen.sh (in the nemo-master directory). This will generate your configure script\n\n*Run ./configure in this same directory. This will tell you if you're missing any packages (you'll be missing a lot of them and it will probably depend on some cinnamon packages which aren't in the default Ubuntu repos)\n\n*Run make in this directory. This should give you your nemo binary which you can then replace your old nemo with.\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Wireless Problem on Acer Aspire 5610z I installed ubuntu 12.04 on my machine, but I can't get wireless connection to work.

Normally, this is a consequence of having the proprietary driver, wl, installed. So, my suggestion is to remove first thing the proprietary driver,\n sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nand then to install the necessary firmware, \nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nand eventually to load your open source module:\nsudo rmmod b43\nsudo modprobe b43\n\n", "Q: While installing any software I get \"files list file for package 'gnupg' is missing final newline\" Package operation failed\nThe installation or removal of a software package failed.\n\ninstallArchives() failed: Selecting previously unselected package libidn11:i386. \n(Reading database ... \n(Reading database ... 5% \n(Reading database ... 10% \n(Reading database ... 15% \n(Reading database ... 20% \n(Reading database ... 25% \n(Reading database ... 30% \n(Reading database ... 35% \n(Reading database ... 40% \n(Reading database ... 45% \n(Reading database ... 50% \n(Reading database ... 55%\ndpkg: unrecoverable fatal error, aborting: \n files list file for package 'gnupg' is missing final newline \nError in function: \nSystemError: E:Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)\n\n\nA: It seems that a special file is corrupted.

The laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15R SE, with 32GB SSD + 1TB HDD, intel i7, 8GB, etc. The thing is that it has Windows 8 and the SSD is used as cache. Those are the two features I'd like to keep.\nSo, here's the question: Can I install Ubuntu so that both OS use the SSD as cache? Is that advisable? what steps should I follow or what things should I take special care about?\nThank you very much, and if you need more info, just ask\nJuan.-\n\nA: No, you cannot have a SSD for caching for both Windows and Linux.\nWindows and Linux have caching program; ISRT from Intel for Windows, and bcache for Linux. But these softwares are incompatible; they rely on the fact that after a reboot the partition is at the same way as it was when you shutdown. And dual booting destroys this expectation.\nPerhaps, the SSD can be divided in two partitions, with each program using one partition. That, I think (but not sure), can be possible.\n", "Q: How to minimize usage of CPU/memory by ffmpeg when recording video I use FFmpeg for making video screen capture from Xvfb display.\nCurrently I invoke it with:\nffmpeg -y -r 15 -g 600 -s 1280x1024x24 -f x11grab -i :100 -vcodec libx264 /tmp/video.mov\n\nAs I record video from about 5 Xvfb sessions my CPU usage is very high and there are lags because of it. Also memory usage is about 300 MB for each of ffmpeg processes.\nWhich parameters for ffmpeg should I use to minimize computer resources usage (particularly CPU and memory) when making video screen capture?\n\nA: It is better to concentrate on using different ffmpeg options that will achieve the same result in a way that uses less resources. That said, there are ways to use less resources if you really need to accomplish a specific thing with ffmpeg and it is using too many resources.\nYou can decrease the priority of ffmpeg's CPU process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal method: Use the nice command to change the process's priority: nice -n 8 ffmpeg -y -r 15 -g 600 -s 1280x1024x24 -f x11grab -i :100 -vcodec libx264 /tmp/video.mov. In Linux, the priority number (the nice command format is nice -n <priority> <command>) ranges from -20 to 20. The greater the integer, the lower the priority is; neutral is 0. If you use the command I gave you and set it to 8, the CPU will give the process less time, which seems like less \"power\". If this number is too high or two low, of course, you can change it.\n\n*GUI method: This isn't recommended because it gives you less control over the exact number and it doesn't take effect as soon as the process begins. However, it is more comprehensible. With ffmpeg running, open the System Monitor. Scroll down to the process named ffmpeg, left click it to select, right click it, and set the priority to \"Low\" or \"Very Low\".\n\n\nIf you're worried about memory usage, too, know that it is not possible to tell a process to only take so much memory and still run. The kernel automatically controls memory allocation for processes. There is a way to cage processes, with the timeout script, so that when a process and any child processes take up too much memory (a limit set by you) they are terminated safely and a notification is displayed. However, if a process is only given so much memory (say by the kernel) and it requests more memory that it cannot have, it will crash.\nSome helpful things to know about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cgroups -\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt\n\n*The kernel's memory controller - \nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt\nUsing knowledge of Cgroups, you can do lots of fun things like controlling the swappiness of a process.\n\nA: 1. Make a lossless RGB output first\nffmpeg -y -framerate 25 -video_size 1280x1024 -f x11grab -i :0.0 -c:v libx264rgb \\\n-crf 0 -preset ultrafast temp.mp4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The input is RGB, so using the encoder libx264rgb will avoid the potentially slow RGB to YUV conversion that would occur if you use plain libx264.\n\n*This uses the quickest x264 encoding preset: ultrafast.\n\n*The output will be lossless because -crf 0 is used.\n2. Then re-encode it\nThe output from the first command will be huge, and most dumb players can't handle RGB H.264 so you can re-encode it:\nffmpeg -i temp.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -vf format=yuv420p out.mp4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can experiment with the -crf value to control output quality. A subjectively sane range is 18-28, where 18 is visually lossless or nearly so. Default is 23.\n\n*Use the slowest preset you have patience for: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow. Default is medium.\n\n*I added -vf format=yuv420p to ensure the output works with dumb players like QuickTime and Windows Media Player. You can omit this if you're uploading it to YouTube or only playing it on VLC, mpv, MPlayer, or any other FFmpeg based player.\nAlso see\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg Wiki: H.264 Encoding Guide\n\nA: -re (input)\nRead input at native frame rate. Mainly used to simulate a grab device, or live input stream (e.g. when reading from a file). Should not be used with actual grab devices or live input streams (where it can cause packet loss). By default ffmpeg attempts to read the input(s) as fast as possible. This option will slow down the reading of the input(s) to the native frame rate of the input(s). It is useful for real-time output (e.g. live streaming).\n", "Q: Firefox problems with refreshing content on screen I had this problem in 13.04 but now in 13.10 this problem is a lot more noticable.

As usual, the upgrade process disabled the PPAs. Afterwards, I re-enabled the PPAs in Software Sources (making sure that the release was set to saucy) and ran an update. Some of the PPAs worked, but others gave 404 errors:\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/duplicity-team/ppa/ubuntu/dists/saucy/main/binary-i386/Packages: 404  Not Found\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/stackapplet-dev/stackapplet/ubuntu/dists/saucy/main/binary-i386/Packages: 404  Not Found\n...\n\nEvidently, this common issue occurs because these PPAs haven't been updated to provide packages for Saucy (when I browse to the PPA URLs, only releases through Raring are listed).\n\"How can I fix a 404 Error when using a PPA or updating my package lists?\" suggests removing the PPAs to fix the errors. However, I don't want to remove these PPAs because I believe they are still maintained. For instance, https://launchpad.net/~stackapplet-dev/+archive/stackapplet had a new upload a few weeks ago. I assume that if I just wait, these PPAs will eventually get updated to support Saucy.\nWhat determines when this happens after a new release of Ubuntu? Does it only happen once the maintainer uploads a new version on Launchpad? How long will I have to wait?\n\nA: The only thing that determines when a PPA (or any package archive in general) will get support for a newer Ubuntu release, is when whomever owns that PPA or archive, decides to update it. There is no guarantee that any PPA on Launchpad, or archive on the Internet, will support whatever version of Ubuntu or Debian you have installed.\n\nA: PPAs don't automatically update for a given release.  When a PPA is \"updated\" it's updated by its maintainer(s) for a given release of Ubuntu.  In this case the maintainers didn't upload a Saucy package, and it won't update until they manually update it.\nYou can probably email the maintainer and ask them to add a Saucy package, however they aren't required to, as some PPAs only provide packages for older releases.\n", "Q: \"com.canonical.indicator.messages\" entry missing from dconf-editor; issues with email message indicator On my 12.04.03 system I don't have com.canonical.indicator.messages.\nEven after \nsudo apt-get install indicator.messages\n\nMail count and new mail notification seems flaky on 12.04.

Wonder if anyone knows how to get around of it. Thanks.\n\nA: I've solved the problem and now I understood why this is a problem that only a limited number of people encountered.\nSo the problem is that I was using SCIM for keyboard input in previous versions of ubuntu, which is out of date and has conflict with many java programs in ubuntu 12.04.

And the filesystem looks to be in reasonable shape, as in:\n> df -k /usr\nFilesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda8       10156344 7349228   2282880  77% /usr\n> df -i /usr\nFilesystem      Inodes  IUsed  IFree IUse% Mounted on\n/dev/sda8      1310720 679355 631365   52% /usr\n\nSome notes:\n(i) /home already had its own partition.  If it had been in /usr I would approach this a little differently.\n(ii) Choice of tools:  I like ls /dev/disk/by-uuid because ls is very, very well known.  I used rsync partly because when I had to do something else for a while before getting back to this, I could run the same rsync command again to \"refresh\" the copy.  Also, I like it and it can do this.  Others may have different utilities that satisfy these criteria.  For example, until a few years ago I would've used cpio.  Whatever gets you through the byte.\n(iii) The placeholders refer to what had been the fat32 (vfat) filesystem on /dev/sda7, mounted at /windows.  I reformatted it in cold blood before the above procedure.  I never bothered changing the mountpoint name, which could be confusing second-hand.\nThanks to all who helped or contributed.\n\nA: It says that you have no space left on /usr partition, you can try to remove something there.\nDid you tried apt-get -f install? \n", "Q: Dazzle DVC 80 on Ubuntu?

Also I read I had to use G parted, but this wasn't effective either.\nIf anyone knows how to install windows8 in a partition already having Ubuntu please help \n\nA: Resizing partitions can be a bit tricky if you have never done it before. A good way to do it is by using a Live CD called GParted, which will help you manage your partitions after you download it and burn it to a CD / USB. \nOnce you have booted from the CD, open the program called 'GParted' and you'll be able to resize a partition by following these instructions (Basically, they tell you to go to the 'resize' option in the 'partitions' menu. On that menu, you'll be able to resize the partition freely). \nFinally, to be able to install Windows on your drive, I think you'll have to format the unallocated space you created to NTFS. Again, the GParted guide is very useful here.\n", "Q: How many monitors support the Radeon hd 6870 eyefinity with Ubuntu? how many monitors the Radeon hd 6870 eyefinity supports with the latest version of Ubuntu?\nAt the moment I have 4 monitors configuration connected to these ports:\n\n\n*\n\n*2 Dvi\n\n*2 minidv with dvi adapter\n\n\nI have read about the MST DISPLAYPORT connection but I don't know if it works in Ubuntu.

I don't think it's because of the age of the distro as it should run fine on my netbook (no UEFI, etc.). Did I miss a needed step except for steps 1-3 outlined in the article? \n\nIf this cannot be remedied: Is there another way of adding an iso to the grub2 menu - without having to manually create a grub2 menuentry which I'd rather avoid? \n\nA: The grml-rescueboot package integrates Grml ISO booting into GRUB. I believe this package first became available around May of 2012.\nThis package provides a script for update-grub which looks for Grml ISO images in /boot/grml and automatically adds an entry for each image.\nI've used this method to create a USB installer with multiple Live media ISOs to allow for \"pick and choose\" installation.\nIf you don't have the package you can install it with sudo apt-get install grml-rescueboot\nSources: Experience \nhttps://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=rescueboot\n\nA: First, you will need to manually add a grub entry as none of the automated tools will generate a menu entry for an .iso .\nSecond, although grub can \"boot\" an iso, the iso needs to be customized to be able to boot this way. 7.04 does not contain such customizations.\nPersonally I do not know what customizations need to be made, I suspect they would be in the kernel and initrd. I asked in #grml (irc) but never got a clear answer.\nThere is some additional discussion (and links) here - How to boot from an .iso file in GRUB2?\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu 13.04 be loaded with a USB flash drive?

I would consider dumping Windows XP later on if I get the hang of the Linux distro.\n\nA: This is an old question, but it is relevant also for the current versions of Ubuntu and Windows.\nGeneral instructions\nThere are general instructions at the following link and links from it,\n\n*\n\n*www.ubuntu.com/download\nUSB alternatives\nThere is more information, also descriptions of persistent live and installed systems in USB drives, at the following link and links from it,\n\n*\n\n*USB alternatives\nDual Boot\n\n*\n\n*A 'split PC, half Windows XP, half Ubuntu 13.04' makes think of what is often called a dual boot system, that you can boot into either Ubuntu or Windows from the grub boot menu.\nThere are alternatives for this in the Ubuntu installer, but the first step should be to shrink the Windows partition from within Windows. Leave the released drive space as 'unallocated'. Do not create partitions in Windows. Then you boot from the Ubuntu USB drive (or DVD disk) and continue the installation.\nVirtualization\n\n*\n\n*Another alternative, that works if the computer is powerful enough, is to install a tool for a virtualization and install 'the other' operating system  in a virtual machine with a virtual disk. Virtualbox is a tool, that is easy to use for this purpose. This method (as well as alternatives) is discussed at this link.\n\n\nA: You can use a live DVD. Installation DVDs for many major distributions load the whole system before installing it. So you can take a gook look before you actually install it. \nYou can use this DVD image in a USB (pen)drive also.\n\nA: Using any OS without Internet surfing may be impossible. I removed Windows XP forever after using to Ubuntu. I suggest you use Virtual Machine and install Ubuntu on it temporary. Then you can save some files and transfer it to another OS also copy from one and past to other OS.

Until recently this setup worked just fine, but after upgrading from Ubuntu 13.04 and Virtualbox 4.2 (at essentially the same time) the fstab mounting stopped working. I get the following error during boot:\nAn error occurred while mounting /home/benme/Documents.\nkeys:Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery\n\nPressing M for manual recovery and then trying to mount manually also fails:\nroot@benme-vb:~# cd /home/benme\nroot@benme-vb:/home/benme# mount Documents\n/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: No such device\n\nBut if I instead skip mounting during boot, wait for Unity to start and then mount manually in a shell, everything works fine:\nbenme-vb ~ % ls Documents\nbenme-vb ~ % sudo mount Documents\n[sudo] password for benme: \nbenme-vb ~ % ls Documents\n    # actual file list omitted\n\nNote that when I mount manually I'm letting mount take all the options from /etc/fstab, and it works.

Luckily I was able to fix it, by loading vboxsf right with the kernel:\n# echo \"vboxsf\" >> /etc/initramfs-tools/modules\n# update-initramfs -u\n\nThe first command adds a parameter to load the module to the kernel and the second updates the init file system. After a reboot I was able to use my fstab-mounts again :)\nWarning: The boot process might freeze, if a shared folder cannot be mounted. So test your configuration, before you add the module to initramfs. If your system hangs anyway, you can boot in recovery mode to fix the problem.\n\nA: I ran afoul of this problem too. I mount /var/www using VBox shared folders functionality, so this was quite annoying.\nThe solution I found was to force the vboxsf module to be loaded early, before the mounting of file systems. Just add vboxsf on a line of its own in /etc/modules.\nAnother solution is to set noauto in /etc/fstab and manually mount drives in /etc/rc.local, but this wasn't such a good solution for me because by that time Apache has already started and been unable to find anything in /var/www.\n\nA: I just wanted to say that forcing the vboxsf module to load early helped me (as in Richard Turner's answer), but the fstab line still didn't work for me.\nWhat I ended up doing was putting the mount command (which did work) into /etc/rc.local. A bit of a hack but it worked.\n\nA: With the shared folder listed in fstab I find that the boot will hang when it tries to mount it using VirtualBox 5 and Ubuntu 14.04. The solution seems to be to delay mounting until the GuestAddition service is available (Richard Turner's /etc/modules solution didn't seem enough for me).\nTo do this make sure you have noauto as the options for the shared folder in /etc/fstab. For example for a shared folder called vmshare:\nvmshare    /home/user/share    vboxsf    defaults,noauto    0    0\n\nThen add a line to /etc/rc.local to mount the share after booting:\nmount vmshare\n\n\nA: It looks like the vboxsf lacks the fs-vboxsf alias (which is how kernel modules get autoloaded when mounting that filesystem type for the first time), so adding the alias in /etc/modprobe.d should do the trick:\n$ echo \"alias fs-vboxsf vboxsf\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/vboxsf.conf\n\n\nA: As per 2020, the only (and clean) working solution for me is the one described in the Arch Wiki as posted by ultracrepidarian.\nIn the meanwhile the entry in the fstab looks slightly different:\ndesktop  /media/desktop  vboxsf  uid=<user-id>,gid=<group-id>,rw,dmode=700,fmode=600  0  0\n\n\nA: In addition to Richard Turner's suggestion of adding vboxsf on a line of its own to /etc/modules, I suggest adding the _netdev mount option to /etc/fstab. I tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and this seems to add just the right amount of delay for the mount to succeed.\nMy /etc/fstab entry:\ndev /media/dev vboxsf defaults,_netdev 0 0\n\nA: I had the same problem, and was working through the suggested solutions, but without success. Torben's solution froze the boot, so had to undo it. Then I thought I should troubleshoot /etc/fstab using sudo mount -a. The syntax of my entry looked perfect, but it still failed. I was also able to manually mount the filesysten using the mount command in the terminal window. \nWhat I found is that I had spaces between the first two parameters (device and mount point). I replaced them with a tab and it works. Really?!!!!\n\nA: I believe I've found the right way to deal with this in Arch Wiki. Use comment=systemd.automount option.\nThe above option goes in the /etc/fstab file with the other options. For example:\nFedora /var/ftp/pub/Fedora vboxsf uid=1001,gid=1001,comment=systemd.automount 0 0\n\n", "Q: Driver for Canon PIXMA MG2200 scanner Does anyone have a driver for Canon MG2200 printer/scanner, since I can't seem to locate one.\n\nA: The printer and scanner drivers can be downloaded from Canon's website and installed in Ubuntu. \nThere you can find both the Printer and scanner drivers.

The method of user207943 worked to finish the install, however, for me I found that most of the upgrade was still unfinished. This took me a while to solve, but in the end was simple, so I thought I would share just in case someone finds this page on a google (like I did). I had to run:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nto finish upgrading packages. This looked like everything was now done (If I paid more attention I would have seen that certain packages like linux-generic were NOT upgraded).

Hopefully I can pull this off.\n\nIf others can so can you.\n\nJust a remark: sometimes it is helpful to have a connection at hand just for a quick check on how to handle something unexpected. But that does not need to be the system you install Ubuntu on.\n\nA: Yes you can, use a CD or a bootable flash disc, but you might need updates latter.\n\nA: The only thing you need an internet connection for is the installation of third-party software, especially the mp3 plugin from the Frauenhoffer Institut, if I remember correctly.\nAt the moment the instant update isn't very crucial because Ubuntu 13.10 released a short time ago. So there aren't many updates out there yet.

Opening the page from section 7 (Miscellaneous) is quite different.\nPages in different sections address different things, though in this case they are similar, consider apt:\nman -f apt:\napt (8)              - Advanced Package Tool\napt (1)              - annotation processing tool\n\nIn this example, apt from section 8 (System administration commands) is completely unrelated to the page from section 1 (Executable programs or shell commands).\nFor future reference, use man -f PAGE_NAME to locate all pages with that name in all sections. You can then open a page from the section you want with man SECTION PAGE_NAME.\nManpage sections\nThe various page sections are as follows and can be found from man man:\n\n\n*\n\n*Executable programs or shell commands\n\n*System calls (functions provided by the kernel)\n\n*Library calls (functions within program libraries)\n\n*Special files (usually found in /dev)\n\n*File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd\n\n*Games\n\n*Miscellaneous  (including  macro  packages  and  conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)\n\n*System administration commands (usually only for root)\n\n*Kernel routines [Non standard]\n\n\n\nA: The section numbers\nman will show the manpage from any section, man 7 will show the manpage from section 7. So, here 7 refers to the section of the particular command for which you are looking for the manual page. \nA       section,  if  provided, will direct man to look only in that section of\n       the manual.\n\nThe sections\nSee the following table for the section numbers of the manual followed by the\n       types of pages they contain.\n\n1:   Executable programs or shell commands\n2:   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)\n3:   Library calls (functions within program libraries)\n4:   Special files (usually found in /dev)\n5:   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd\n6:   Games\n7:   Miscellaneous  (including  macro  packages  and  conventions), e.g.\n             man(7), groff(7)\n8:   System administration commands (usually only for root).     Overviews of various topics, conventions and protocols,\n                   character set standards, and miscellaneous other things.\n9:   Kernel routines [Non standard]\n\n\nCommands in more than one section\nIn most of the cases you will want to use the man command without additional n. However, in some cases a command will appear in more than one section. For example if you issue the command man open, you get the man page for openvt from section 1. But if you need to see the man page for open as a C (or system call, as per the above table) command, you need to issue man 2 open.\nA very similar example will be man printf and man 3 printf. Please issue the commands and see for yourself the difference in output.\n\nYour issue of man 7 unix (UNIX(7))\nSo, that UNIX(7) means that it belongs to section 7. \n\nWhich section will be shown by default if I do not provide a section number?\nThe default action is to search in all  of  the  available\nsections, following a pre-defined order and to show only the first page\nfound, even if page exists in several sections.\n\nHow do I know the section number of a command?\nShould you need to find out what sections a term/command falls in with man -k (equivalent to the apropos command). So,   man -k printf\n           will search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword   printf  as  regular expression.  Print out any matches.  (Equivalent  to apropos -r printf). Issue the command, see the ton you get. If need to avoid substring matches,  (e.g. it will show sprintf if you run man -k printf), so you need to use ^term to limit it, as below,\nman -k '^printf'\nPrintf (3o)          - Formatted output functions.\nprintf (1)           - format and print data\nprintf (3)           - formatted output conversion\n\n\nRelated command\nA related command is apropos as indicated above, which  searches the manual page names and descriptions. If you are not sure which manual page you are looking for but have a general idea, use this command.\n", "Q: wifi access point with wicd? How can I make a wifi access point with wicd?\nI have a wired connection at laptop, and would like to deliver wifi to my android phone.\nSo in wicd I press Network -> create an ad hoc network, which as I understand makes a wifi network. I can't see it in my phone.\nWhen I've been using network manager, it is called hotspot there, and I had to connect to it myself in order to deliver it. So I press connect to my own wifi. But wicd then turns off my wired connection. And I'm stuck and authentication phase.\nI'm on kubuntu, 13.10 has some bug in network manager, so I switched to wicd.\nThis might be related: \"does wicd allows controlling two interfaces at the same time?

Are there any alternatives?\n\nA: You can create a preconfiguration file using tools in the debconf-utils package.  You can create a preconfiguration file manually with:\n<owner> <question> <type> <value> \n\nor as an example:\nmy-package username string Bob\nmy-package password string I$aN1ceGuy\n\nEasier is to install it on your machine and run:\ndebconf-get-selections | grep my-package\n\nUse the output to create a file.\nOnce you have the file, use: \ndebconf-set-selections <filename>.  \ndpkg -i my-package\n\nThe selections listed in filename will be used by default and the package will install silently.  \nhttp://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/apbs03.html.en\n\nA: For such things you can write an expect script. It's not very difficult to handle.\nFirst you have to install the interpreter:\napt-get install expect\n\nThen you can write something like this for example:\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nset timeout 30\nset password \"pass\"\nset username \"user\"\n\n#run the command\nspawn dpkg -i package.deb\n\n# Look for username prompt\nexpect \"*?sername:*\" #<--- this statement is important it wait's for a prompt \"username:\"\nsend \"$username\\r\"\n\n# Look for passwod prompt\nexpect \"*?assword:*\" #<--- the same with the \"password:\" prompt\nsend \"$password\\r\"\n\n#dpkg -i continues\n\nThe script must be executable, of course. Expect is perfect for controlling interactive terminal programs via script (ssh, ftp, ...)\n", "Q: Cannot shut down from KDE workspace after upgrade to Saucy Adding to my sequel of things broken after the upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*NetworkManager broken after upgrade to Kubuntu Saucy\n\n*User cannot mount disks after upgrade to Saucy\nWhen I select shutdown from the KDE workspace, I only get back to the login screen.

Networking only works from a root shell, mounting as well and now shutdown.\nWhat is up with all that?\n\nA: My system was presenting exactly the same symptoms after the upgrade to saucy baulked halfway through at tex-common and some other packages, leaving me with a crippled laptop. Via chroot I reconfigured the policy packages as explained in your other thread\ndpkg-reconfigure policykit-1 policykit-desktop-privileges consolekit polkit-kde-1. I also finished off the upgrade with apt-get update && apt-get upgrade.\nThat probably helped, but still didn't give me a working network connection.

Then run resize2fs.  You should then be able to resize the file system.\nIn my experience, however, growing arrays (I grew one stepwise from 3+1 to ultimately 8+2 with 1TB disks over 2+ years) does seem to impact performance.  This is possibly because things like strip size are dependent on the number of data disks (i.e., n-1 for RAID5, n-2 for RAID6) and thus will no longer be optimized for the new array.\nStrip width = [Stride size] × [# Data Disks]\nYou'll want to address this with tune2fs afterwards, with something like:\ntune2fs -E stride=n,stripe-width=m /dev/mdx\nSee this for more detail: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID_setup\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 13.10 on my netbook I used YUMI to make a bootable USB stick and I used both 12.04 and 13.10 iso files.

The browser doesn't crash, just the tabs, and I can open new ones (but they also crash after a while).\nHere's the output command free on the terminal after a tab crash:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       2041116    1722740     318376          0       2868     267256\n-/+ buffers/cache:    1452616     588500\nSwap:      2085884        104    2085780\n\nCompared to the output before the crash:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       2041116    1967108      74008          0      14632     253036\n-/+ buffers/cache:    1699440     341676\nSwap:      2085884         40    2085844\n\n\nA: I'm not sure about the issue with the tabs crashing after logging in, however, I used to have issues running tabs on Chrome Ubuntu 12.04. I found this typically happened while watching a video in one tab, with more than one tab open and a program or two open. Sometimes, I needed this for school, so it was inevitable. When watching videos or using programs for personal use, I stopped multitasking and that kept the tabs from crashing most times. \nThis issue is not specific to Ubuntu - I also used Win 7 computers at school which had the same issue. Again, this is with multiple tabs open (usually one running video) and one or more programs in addition to Chrome open.\nI believe that issue is a hardware one - too small a processor for everything that's running. I was using a very small net-book with out a lot of power or memory. If these tabs are ones that you have opening on startup, you may want to disable that (disabling applications from opening upon log - in is one of the first things articles/blogs will suggest to speed up Ubuntu).\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.10 radeon.dpm=1 Does radeon power management work out of the box on ubuntu 13.10 by putting radon.dpm=1 on the kernel boot parameters or do I need also to update the firmware files ?\n\nA: I asume that you might have to update the firmware as I have tried it without updating the firmware and it does not work for me out of the box with radeon.dpm=1 as boot parameter.

I have machines running on MaaS using Juju. Some of them failed to deploy because  a hook didn't run because of an (invalid) setting I set in the config. In the Jju UI, I tried marking them as resolved, and then trying to remove them (and repeated through a few cycles of them going green and and then red). \n(I believe doing resolve + remove will make juju not get stuck on the fact that the hook didn't work, and let juju just get rid of the machine.)\nNow I have units that seem stuck and say \n    agent-state: error\n    agent-state-info: 'hook failed: \"install\"'\n    agent-version: 1.16.0.1\n    life: dying\n\nin juju status. I've tried destroying the units and the machines they are on. Is there any way to just give up on those units and recycle the machines the are on for another try?\nI also tried marking the units resolved on the command line, but I'm getting conflicting messages.

Sometimes, it just takes a while for all the hooks finish executing and then hopefully the service should no longer be stuck in a dying state. Note that to actually free up the machine, after you have destroyed the unit (juju destroy-unit) you need to run the juju destroy-machine (with the machine number) to release it. Note that juju destroy-machine will not terminate a machine that is currently acting as a unit, so it will not release a unit if it is currently in the dying state.\nI presume you were starting to build your environment. It would be helpful to check the log files of the machines (I also check them but not to find why they don't die but rather why they didn't complete).\n\nA: Backup Juju's database before you deploy a service.\nIf things go wrong and you can't fix it, just restore Juju from the backup db.\n", "Q: Repackaging an installed application with libraries included I have a package installed in Ubuntu-13.10, called \"GPIV\", which is not available for Fedora, which I use in my lab for some unavoidable reasons.

Is is possible to repackage the installed GPIV executable as a tar ball, which also include all the linked libraries that the GPIV utilizes when it runs on Ubuntu.

But at least for now, Matlab 2012 is not working.\nYour other way is to use Virtualbox and then run MatLab from there.

Note your php5 stuff might get removed and then need to be reinstalled after the fact, because php5-common is a dependency for all the other php5 stuff.\n", "Q: How to install software to OS on other disk?

If you have an icon on the Desktop and do right click -> Rename and then click on the text, the text changed to black and the background changed to white in 13.04, but now in 13.10 the background changes to transparent.  Unfortunately, that is not good if the desktop is a dark colour.

I'd suggest to install Lubuntu 13.10 on your machines due to the fact that this version (Lubuntu) is much lighter than Ubuntu and would run much better on the machines you have.

I would like to deploy something but I need to be able to have teammates interact with the environment.\nHow do I do this? Are ssh keys involved? \n\nA: With juju 1.16 and newer, you should be able to juju bootstrap to initialize the environment. This will create a ~/.juju/environments/$ENVNAME.jenv file.\nThat file has all the information needed to connect to your Juju environment. (admin-secret, control bucket, etc.)\nFor most uses of Juju, you don't need ssh access, because you can add new services, relate them, etc without SSH.\nIf you do want shared ssh access (such as for 'juju ssh 1'), then you need to have shared keys. It is possible to set \"authorized-keys\" in your environment's configuration, or to use juju set authorized-keys=XXX to a list of keys. \nHowever, authorized-keys is only used when launching new instances, it doesn't retroactively add them to machines that are already running.

I will continue to try to do that.  I have run boot-repair from Ubuntu running from CD.  I can no longer boot to Windows 8 on my Sony VAIO SVF14A15CXB but I am fast losing my concern over this.  I am more concerned that I can't install Ubuntu on the hard disk, so every time I boot up I have to install the wifi and resupply the 16 character wifi password, and I would have to reinstall things like GIMP and video codecs every  time I boot up.  \nCurrently, I have an understanding that I need to get back to BIOS, but I am having a difficult time accomplishing that.  There is an \"assist\" key and I am randomly pressing that along with the function shifter key and F1 F2 F3 and ctrl.

I had to restart my host, but afterward the USB was broken, which brought me here. \nI re-installed Virtualbox from scratch, completely removing using \"Programs and Features\", then installed again.\nNow the USB works correctly, I have devices showing up. I had to unplug and replug one of my devices to get it to work within the client however.\n", "Q: Terrible graphics performance with Intel graphics on Ubuntu 13.10 Graphics performance is now terrible (videos play at ~1 fps, opening Dash is extremely slow etc) on my Dell Latitude E4300 after upgrading to 13.10 (13.04 was fine). The graphics adapter is listed as: \" Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (version 7)\". \nAny ideas on where to look for the problem?\n\nA: For anyone else that runs into this problem, it doesn't appear to have anything to do with the graphics driver, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/policykit-desktop-privileges/+bug/1240336.\nTo fix, run:\nsudo pam-auth-update --force\nand reboot.

I'm new to Ubuntu and i just downloaded 13.10. It shows that I have gnome downloaded or at least I think so cause it has a green check by it and an option to uninstall but how do I open gnome?\n\nA: Log out. Click the Ubuntu logo next to your name, and choose GNOME from the list. If it is not there, you don't have GNOME installed.\nUbuntu uses several parts of GNOME though, so depending on what you're seeing as \"GNOME\" with the green check in the Software Center, it may not be GNOME as a whole. For example, gnome-terminal is a part of GNOME, and is installed in Ubuntu by default.\n", "Q: Give a programm an unconstrained amount of RAM I am running a Linux application, not WINE.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I find out if it has any memory constraints, if any at all?\n\n*If it does have memory constraints how can I increase it?\n\n\nI have 12GB of system RAM. \nThe process seems to be capping at 3.4GB of RAM. The name of the process is KSP.x86, it is a game.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"give it more RAM\" exactly, as that's not how the system works. If the program is only using 3.4 GB of RAM, then that is all it needs to use. If it needs to use any more than that, it will try to use more. There is no need to try and force it to use more.\nIf it is a 32-bit application, it may not be able to use more.\nThough, if it's using that much RAM, I would wonder why, as it really shouldn't need to.\n", "Q: Can I use fractions/decimals in a bash script? Is there a certain syntax to use while using fractions or decimals in a bash script?\nI tried using the following script (in Ubuntu 12.04):\n#!/bin/bash\n{\nn=9\necho \"$n\"\nfor (( i=.5; $i <10; i++ ));\n      do\n      let \"c=$i+1\"\n      echo $i \"+\" $c\ndone\n}\n\nThis works with i=1, but it generates a syntax error when I put in .5.\n\nA: Yeah bash only handles integers but you can route around the issue, either by not using bash (Python is very simple to pick up) or by using bc to handle the calculations.\nRemember that your condition in your for loop isn't going to work at fractions so you'll need to expand that too.\nstep=\"0.5\"\n\nfor (( i=0; $i<$(bc<<<\"10/$step\"); i++ )); do\n      echo $(bc<<<\"$step * $i\")\ndone\n\nThat'll echo 0 through 9.5 in 0.5 increments.\n\nA: You can use Zsh.\nMost shells, including Bash, don't directly support floating-point computations, and as Oli has explained, the typical workaround is to call bc. However, you have a number of other options.\nOne of them is to use the Z Shell. zsh is a Bourne-style shell (same \"family\" as Bash) that does directly support floating point computations. So if you're willing to make it a Zsh script instead of a Bash script, you can do that by changing the first line of your script from #!/bin/bash to #!/bin/zsh.\nOnce you do that, it will automatically work! In this case, no further modifications to the script are required. (Sometimes, a Bash feature and the corresponding Zsh feature work differently so translating a script from Bash to Zsh requires you to make changes. Though sometimes a Bash script with mistakes in it can actually become correct when treated as a Zsh script, due to different design decisions in Zsh about what expansions should be performed automatically.)\nThis is the output:\n9\n0.5000000000 + 1.5000000000\n1.5000000000 + 2.5000000000\n2.5000000000 + 3.5000000000\n3.5000000000 + 4.5000000000\n4.5000000000 + 5.5000000000\n5.5000000000 + 6.5000000000\n6.5000000000 + 7.5000000000\n7.5000000000 + 8.5000000000\n8.5000000000 + 9.5000000000\n9.5000000000 + 10.5000000000\n\nYou'll need Zsh installed for it to run. Zsh does not generally come preinstalled on Ubuntu but it's provided by the zsh package. If you don't have zsh then you'll see an error like:\n-bash: ./your-script: /bin/zsh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\nUbuntu's zsh package gives you both /bin/zsh and /usr/bin/zsh. If you want your script to be portable to other systems that have Zsh but in different places, then you might want to use this hashbang line at the top of your script instead:\n#!/usr/bin/env zsh\n\nIf the user can run Zsh by typing zsh and pressing Enter, then putting that at the top of a script will usually work (and run the same zsh executable the user would run). That won't work on 100% of systems--technically, env does not itself have to be provided in /usr/bin--but in practice it's quite rare for it to fail, provided that zsh is in the user's $PATH.\nFor more information on arithmetic evaluation in Zsh, including floating-point arithmetic, see 11 Arithmetic Evaluation in The Z Shell Manual.\nDecreasing Output Precision\nA floating-point variable x in Zsh may show more precision than you want when you expand it like $x:\n% ((x=.5))\n% echo \"$x\"\n0.5000000000\n\nOne way to expand it without those extra zeros is to use arithmetic expansion instead:\n% echo \"$((x))\"\n0.5\n\nYou can also use the printf command to display a value with limited precision:\n% printf '%.2f\\n' \"$x\"\n0.50\n\nThat works in other shells, too, even when the shell doesn't support floating-point arithmetic. (Some shells don't have a printf builtin, but you can still use that command because a standalone-executable version is installed at /usr/bin/printf.) The printf command won't perform other arithmetic, though, besides rounding.\nEven in situations where you don't need numeric formatting, printf is often a better choice than echo in shell scripts.\nIn case you're interested, the Zsh manual (as referenced above) explains how precisely floating point-values are actually stored. (Usually it's IEEE 754 binary64.)\nYou can use simpler syntax (in Bash, too).\nYour script is okay as it is, but you can simplify its syntax for improved readability:\n\n*\n\n*Your script doesn't need the grouping provided by { and }.\n\n*A ; is redundant at the end of a line.\n\n*Inside (( )), $i can just be written i.\n\n*You can use (( )) rather than let. Without a leading $, it evaluates without expanding to the result. Not all shells support this non-expansion form, but Bash and Zsh (and some others) do.\n\n*It's good to quote when you don't want word-splitting to occur even when doing so is optional (as in this case). But you can enclose more than one expansion in the same double-quoted span of text.\n\nLeaving out the bit about n at the beginning (you may very well need that for your purpose, but I cannot tell what it's for), I suggest:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\nfor ((i = .5; i < 10; i++))\ndo\n    ((c = i + 1))\n    echo \"$i + $c\"\ndone\n\nOr, if you don't want those extra zeros to be printed:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\nfor ((i = .5; i < 10; i++))\ndo\n    echo \"$((i)) + $((i + 1))\"\ndone\n\nThis prints:\n0.5 + 1.5\n1.5 + 2.5\n2.5 + 3.5\n3.5 + 4.5\n4.5 + 5.5\n5.5 + 6.5\n6.5 + 7.5\n7.5 + 8.5\n8.5 + 9.5\n9.5 + 10.5\n\nFinally, to address one point of possible confusion:\n\n*\n\n*It is okay to assign i with i = .5 because this was evaluated as an arithmetic expression, due to appearing inside (( )), and so spaces around = were allowed. The spaces are not required and you need not use them, but you may do so. (I have done so.)\n\n*Outside of an arithmetic expression, assigning a shell variable requires there to be no spaces on either side of =. That is, normally you must write var=val, not var = val. Similarly, outside of an arithmetic expression, accessing the value of a shell variable requires $ (e.g., $i, ${i}).\n\n\nA: There is a way to fake fractions, a bit awkward but it is usable in some cases:\n#!/bin/bash\n{\nn=9\necho \"$n\"\n\nfor (( i=5; $i <100; i+=10 ))\ndo\n    let \"c=$i+10\"\n    echo \"$(( $i / 10 )).$(( $i % 10 )) + $(( $c / 10 )).$(( $c % 10 ))\"\ndone\n}\n\nWith div/modulo you can also actually do some nifty (read: awkward) calculations.\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\n{ \nn=9; \necho \"$n\"; \nfor i in `seq .5 10`;       \ndo       \nc=`bc <<< $i+1`;       \necho $i \"+\" $c; done; \n}\n\n\nA: I'll point out that while bash is limited to integer math, ksh93 is not. So this (simpler example) works fine:\n$ for ((i=0.5; i<3; i=$((i+1)))); do print $i ; done\n0.5\n1.5\n2.5\n\nWe use i=$((i+1)) rather than i++ because ++ only works with integers.\nSo I think this is what the original questioner wants (except of course that it's not being done with bash):\n$ for ((i=0.5; i<10; i=$((i+1)))); do c=$((i+1)) ; print $i + $c ; done\n0.5 + 1.5\n1.5 + 2.5\n2.5 + 3.5\n3.5 + 4.5\n4.5 + 5.5\n5.5 + 6.5\n6.5 + 7.5\n7.5 + 8.5\n8.5 + 9.5\n9.5 + 10.5\n\nThis is all done within the shell itself with no need for external commands. If there is a requirement to use bash, then the suggestions that do use external commands are the way to go.\n\nA: \nBash itself cannot support floating point numbers, but there is a program called bc that can do decimal arithmetic.\n\nYou script should be rewrite to use BC (aka Best Calculator) or another other utility. So, how can you do this? There is no way that you can use for loop since the bash builtin itself doesn't support floating points. Either you use another variable to control inside your loop and use 1 (or 0) as starting point.\n\nA: The question is asking to \"use fractions/decimals in a bash script?\".\nSuggestions which \"route around the issue, ...by not using bash\" are NOT answering the question.\nThe following bashes a sample decimal:\n\n# A crude bash trick for floats\n# Bash does NOT do fractions/decimals. \n# Bash does integers (whole numbers).\n# A simple loop can solve this though, not a big issue\n# example whole number division shown below, results in float answer:\n\necho -n Enter number to divide:; read n\necho -n to be divided by?:; read div\n\nmult=1      ;# to scale dividend, enabling higher precision quotient\n\n# modify precision in both 'for' loops below,\n# 2nd number only\n# since they don't accept variables\n\nfor i in {1..6}; do mult=$mult\"0\"; done ;# precision at 6 decimals\n\nresult=$(echo -n $((n/div)).)       ;# division, with decimal point\ntemp=$((n%div*mult/div))        ;# numbers after decimal\n\necho $result$temp\n\n# ----------------- to remove trailing zeros - OPTIONAL -----------------\n# optionally, insignificant zeros may be removed\n# many ways of doing this; I'm avoiding any new commands eg. awk, sed, head, tail\n# check other topics to remove trailing zeros\n\n#unset temp1\n\nif [ $temp != 0 ]           ;# zero remainders to stay as a float\nthen\n\nfor i in {1..6}; do             # modify precision in both for loops\n\nj=${temp: $((-0-$i)):1}         ;# find trailing zeros\n\nif [ $j != 0 ]              ;# remove trailing zeros\nthen\n    temp1=$temp1\"$j\"\nfi\n    done\nelse \n    temp1=0\nfi\n\ntemp1=$(echo $temp1 | rev)\necho $result$temp1\n\n# ----------------- OPTION CODE -----------------\n\n", "Q: Copy only folders not files?

I have been using OpenCV for years with this machine and I have managed to avoid manual compilation so far. But in Ubuntu 13.10, when I try to install libopencv-dev from the repositories, it brings along libopencv-ocl, which seems to be dependent on nvidia drivers. Letting the driver install messes up my xserver completely and when I do glxinfo afterwards, I get this:\nname of display: :0.0\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nError: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig\n\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0.0\".\n\nTo solve this, I purge all nVidia drivers and reinstall xserver, much like it has been suggested here, and when I purge the nvidia drivers, OpenCV development libraries are also removed, as apt-get tells me they are no longer needed. This is foreign to me, because I expected a warning that I have installed packages that depend on this, but how can removing a dependency automatically remove the package I installed without warnings or asking? I understand it has something to do with nVidia being the provider of the libopencv-ocl in the repo. How could I get around it? I would rather not compile OpenCV if I can help it. I have seen similar questions, but not a suitable answer.\n\nA: I had the same problem, to get around it you can install an alternative provider of libopencl1.  If there isn't one available for your specific graphics card (i.e. one for AMD/ATI appears to be absent from the repositories) you can use the generic one:\nsudo apt-get install ocl-icd-libopencl1\n\nIf you already installed libopencv-dev, you will also want to remove the redundant packages it brought in:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nSeems strange to me that the Nvidia provider is brought in by default rather than the generic one - maybe some packaging wizard can sort this out.\nThere is a bug for this issue here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/opencv/+bug/1245260\n\nA: sudo apt-get install libopencv-highgui-dev\n\nthen compile from source, this also has a benefit that the nonfree moudle of SIFT and SURF is available.\n", "Q: How can I check if a PPA has packages for another Ubuntu version?

Would someone please explain how to fix this?\nI have windows 7 64 bits.\n\nA: It means that you need the 32-bit libraries of lua scripts:\nsudo apt-get install liblua5.1-0-dev:i386\n\nThat should do it. As I see it, you will lack tons of libraries, so you should also use:\nsudo apt-get build-dep vlc\n\nto install all the libraries. Also, if you are building as target Windows 64-bits you should use x86_64-w64-mingw32 instead i586-mingw32msvc as said in the instructions:\n\nThis is known as the host triplet, although it's more of a pair than a\n  triplet in the case of Mingw. The exact value depends on your\n  installation of the toolchain. Notably on Debian/Ubuntu, these values\n  must be used:\ni686-w64-mingw32 for Windows 32-bits, using the Mingw-w64 toolchain\nx86_64-w64-mingw32 for Windows 64-bits, using the Mingw-w64 toolchain\ni586-mingw32msvc for Windows 32-bits, using the Mingw32 toolchain\nAgain, you MUST substitute the value in the following command\n  snippets.\n\n", "Q: Why the services do not start at installation? I've seen this sometime now, but not finding anything in the ubuntu man about this peculiar policy-rc.d binary that prevents services from being started/restarted/stopped when called by dpkg/apt, so I would like to know what is the reason of this.\nSetting up lxc (0.9.0-0ubuntu3.6) ...\ninvoke-rc.d: policy-rc.d denied execution of start.\ninvoke-rc.d: policy-rc.d denied execution of start.\ninvoke-rc.d: policy-rc.d denied execution of start.\n\nApparently, no package owns this binary:\ndpkg -S /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d\ndpkg-query: no path found matching pattern /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d\n\n\nA: This \"script\" is included in the sysv-rc package. This is part of a Debian policy which allows sysadmins to control what services starts/restarts/stops whenever they install/upgrade/uninstall packages:\n\nPOLICY-RC.D   Policy layer (/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d) interface:\nMost Debian systems will not have this script as the need for a policy\n  layer is not very common. Most people using chroot jails just need an\n  one-line script which returns an exit status of 101 as the jailed\n  /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d script.\nThe /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d file must be managed through the\n  alternatives system (/usr/sbin/update-alternatives) by any packages\n  providing it.\n/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d [options]   []\n/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d [options] --list  [...]\n\n(Source)\nSo, what happens here? Well, whenever this script is present it will return a code which states the current policy of the local system (which is by default 101 = action forbidden by policy). If you want to change the policy, just modify the file as root to any of this values:\n  0 - action allowed\n  1 - unknown action (therefore, undefined policy)\n 100 - unknown initscript id\n 101 - action forbidden by policy\n 102 - subsystem error\n 103 - syntax error\n 104 - [reserved]\n 105 - behaviour uncertain, policy undefined.\n 106 - action not allowed. Use the returned fallback actions\n       (which are implied to be \"allowed\") instead. \n\nThe script is still a place holder, but when completed all these values could be returned. If you want to allow any change just change exit 101 for exit 0 and done. Whenever you install/remove/upgrade a service these will be (re)started/stopped.\n", "Q: How to use custom background picture in Ubuntu 13.10?

What is an extended partition? Why do I need to use it to install Ubuntu if I already have four partitions that are factory installed?\n\nA: There is a limit on the number of primary partition on HDD. The reason is the structure of MBR (Master Boot Record). MBR has only 64 bytes to store the partition table. One partition's information will take 16 bytes. So apply your mathematics here and you will find only 4 Primary partitions are possible in HDD. If you create all the 4 primary partition and still you have some free space in HDD, it will become unusable.\nTo overcome the limit of four partition, you can create an Extended partition in which you can create Logical partitions. And remember Extended partition itself is a primary partition. In this way we can create more than 4 partitions.\nSo basically it is Extended partition which allows to create more than 4 partitions in a HDD. The extra partitions which we simply call Logical partition will always come under Extended partition.\nI've found following links so helpful, hope you would like it:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are partitions and logical drives?\n\n*Disk Partitioning\nHowever, most new computers use the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT) system instead.

Is there a way I can remove all of them at once, or groups of them? \nOutput of sudo dpkg -l | grep \"^rc\"\nrc  gstreamer0.10-plugins-good:i386             0.10.31-1ubuntu1.2                          GStreamer plugins from the \"good\" set\nrc  libaa1:i386                                 1.4p5-39ubuntu1                             ASCII art library\nrc  libaio1:i386                                0.3.109-2ubuntu1                            Linux kernel AIO access library -

I cant use my lap with such low brightness.\nThen i reinstalled 13.10 again, This time full hdd reset. Same problem occurred.

You can only uninstall your AMD graphics proprietary driver to solve it.\nIn login screen, press \"CTRL + ALT + F3\" into command line, and login with your username.\nThen use this command to uninstall your driver:\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx*\nsudo reboot\n\nIf it works, then you can try Install the driver with this command\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-updates fglrx-pxpress\nsudo reboot\n\nBut because of current compatibility issues, sometimes it is possible boot to \"the screen went black with only the 'x' cursor showing\". You can try it, or not for now and wait for some time before AMD improvement the driver.\nThen about brightness problem.

There was a time when the Ubuntu 12.04 ISO could be burnt to a CD, but it has been updated, and now the Ubuntu 12.04.3 ISO is too big to fit on a CD, and so are the ISOs for later Ubuntu releases.

What can I do to get out of the grub shell?\n\nA: Did not figure out yet how to make the menu work.\nHowever, from this minimal grub, you can load an installed ubuntu; Just use the commands:\n$ linux (hd0,gpt2)/boot/vmlinuz-3.11.0-12-generic.efi.signed root=/dev/sda2\n$ initrd (hd0,gpt2)/boot/initrd.img-3.11.0-12-generic\n$ boot\n\nIn above, use tab completion to obtain correct values. Eg, hd + tab will show you possible disks and partitions (gpt1, gpt2, ...) on the disk. As EFI will be in a first partition, your linux will normally be on a gpt2. You need the root option pointing to the name of the /dev in linux, so for the second on first hd, this normally will be /dev/sda2\nThe initrd loads the modules you need to talk to your hardware with linux, and boot starts the boot. Once in linux, you at least can start to try to fix the problem.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 13.10 not detect my Win7 partition?

Nothing works. \nIs there a workaround to load the headset without using the command force-reload ? To make the pulseaudio daemon recognize the device automatically ?\nI tried adding :\n    pcm.bluetooth {\n    type bluetooth\n    device \"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\"\n    profile \"auto\"\n   }\n\nto a file .asoundrc in my home directory but it doesn't make a difference\nAfter killing the pulseaudio daemon, my even volume hotkeys stop working.

Is there any other way of binding the keys to the new daemon (after restarting) ? \nUPDATE\nFound the problem. Using the command \npactl list | grep -i module-bluetooth-discover\n\nI found out that the bluetooth discover module was not loaded.\nBut my default.pa file in /etc/pulse contains the lines \n.ifexists module-bluetooth-discover.so\nload-module module-bluetooth-discover\n.endif\n\nSo why does the module not load on pulseaudio startup ?\nAfter issuing the command \nsudo pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nThe bluetooth headset works properly and is detected automatically, without killing and restarting alsa. \n\nA: This:\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth \nsudo pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nworked for me on Ubuntu 14.10 (Lenovo x240) to have at least my bluetooth device listed in pulseaudio. \n\nA: It seems there is an issue with some (legacy?) code in Blueman which deliberately unloads module-bluetooth-discover on startup (i.e. after it's been loaded from /etc/pulse/default.pa.  For more details see here: https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/issues/64.\n\nA: I know this is a bit of an old post. But as I recently had the same problem I came across a rather simple solution: just install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\n\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1909957\ngood luck with that :)\n\nA: After analize tons of post my conclusion is that blue man is unloading deliberately the module module-bluetooth-discover, so in my case the solution was uninstall blueman from my system. After that, everything works ok.\n\nA: I found a fix for this on another answer, the problem is that the pulseaudio bluetooth module is loaded before X11, changing a couple of config files do the trick: PulseAudio can not load bluetooth module 15.10/16.04/16.10\nvim /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nComment out (with an # at the beginning of the line) the following line:\n#load-module module-bluetooth-policy\n#load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nNow edit the file /usr/bin/start-pulseaudio-x11 find the following lines:\n   if [ x”$SESSION_MANAGER” != x ] ; then\n    /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-x11-xsmp “display=$DISPLAY session_manager=$SESSION_MANAGER” > /dev/null\n   fi\n\nand change them to this:\n   if [ x\"$SESSION_MANAGER\" != x ] ; then\n    /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-x11-xsmp \"display=$DISPLAY session_manager=$SESSION_MANAGER\" > /dev/null\n   #\n   # Added per StackExchange http://askubuntu.com/questions/366032/pulseaudio-not-detecting-bluetooth-headset-automatically\n   #\n    /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-bluetooth-policy\n    /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n   fi\n\nThis way the Pulse audio’s Bluetooth modules will not be downloaded at boot time but after x11 is started.\nThis fix goes against the current suggestion at:  https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Bluetooth/\n\nA: sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\n\nWorked for me too, but it was not persistent after a reboot, and I also had to manually set the default audio device in volume control each time.\nAdding it to .profile also didn't work - unless it was preceded with an 8 second sleep delay.\nFound a solution that worked persistently with just a few clicks:\nRight-click the blueman icon -> Plugins\n\nAnd disable the PulseAudio plugin.\n\nA: Running Xubuntu 13.10 64bit I had the same problem. Loading module-bluetooth-discover manually fixes the problem. I it also fixes it permanently. I rebooted and the headset worked without loading module-bluetooth-discover. Seems it has to be successfully connected once and then it's working fine.\nI wonder why default.pa contains module-bluetooth-discover and the module is present on disk but it is not listed in pactl list?\nAlso look at configuration tab in pavuvontrol and set the profile of the headset. I have the choice between off/a2dp/hfp, default was off, so no pulseaudio input or output appeared even though the headset was connected.\n\nA: I also have this problem on ubuntu 14.04.\nThe simpliest solution is just add official blueman devs ppa:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~blueman/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nIt works for me after update.\n\nA: [UPDATE]\nOn KXStudio there is an special setup with Cadence, the right files to edit are located at /usr/share/cadence/pulse2jack/, there are 2 files play.pa and play+rec.pa. Add this to both:\nload-module module-bluetooth-policy\nload-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\n[Original - good for debugging]\nOn Ubuntu+KDE and KXStudio I'm using an autostart script like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\nsleep 10\n/usr/bin/pactl load-module module-bluetooth-policy\n/usr/bin/pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nALSO, make sure you did this as well:\nsudo apt install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth pavucontrol\n\nIt is very important to have pavucontrol in order to switch among profiles (high fidelity A2DP or headset HSP/HFP)\nAND, if you are unlucky, then it might be due to your antenna settings, so try this:\nsudo rfkill unblock 0\nsudo hciconfig hci0 up\n\nNow enjoy your wireless headset!\n", "Q: ssh command history and \"autocomplete\" I need to work with ubuntu server remotely using ssh.

I deployed the Havana version of Openstack Keystone, and an the also deployed the HA Cluster charm for it and added a relation.

(How does it do this if it is on the same machine?)\n\nA: It would be great to understand why your deployment of HA Cluster with Keystone failed; for most of the OpenStack API services (Cinder, Glance, Nova Cloud Controller and Keystone), a VIP (Virtual IP) is required to complete clustering - for example:\njuju set keystone vip=192.168.22.1\n\nThe relation between HA Cluster and Keystone will fail to establish with a hook error if this is not supplied.  If you did not provide this prior to relating HA Cluster with Keystone, you can set it as described above and resolve/retry the relation that failed:\njuju resolved --retry keystone/0\n\nHopefully this will resolve the error and result in a functioning, clustered Keystone.\nAs your cluster never formed, your should also be able to remove the relation between HA Cluster and Keystone; however your will have to manually resolve any failed relations before Juju will let you do this:\njuju resolved keystone/0\njuju remove-relation keystone hacluster\n\nNote that if you had managed to form a cluster removing the relation will not de-cluster the service; it locks in the configuration.\n", "Q: Can We install ubuntu 4.10 on virtualbox?

Once installed, everything will work just fine.\nMore info here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen\n\nA: Had the same problem here, also with a Sager NP7330; solved it by using the -nomodeset boot option when booting up (I believe the kernel used in 13.10 cannot automatically detect/use the video hardware on this machine like it does with others).\nFor more information, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions.\n", "Q: How to update libsoup to the latest version I would like to update my libsoup to the latest version as found in the launchpad for libsoup2.4.

This is what I did to get my calendar working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Thunderbird if it's running\n\n*Copy all files from backup profile directory's calendar-data subdirectory into your new profile directory. Likely local.sqlite is the only file needed, but I had a few others so I copied them over as well.\n\n*Open up prefs.js from your backup and look for lines like:\nuser_pref(\"calendar.list.sortOrder\", \"3bf851bb-ece1-48df-8de3-c814c05e5fe7\");\n\n*Open up the same file in your new profile directory and find the same line.

Confirmed that everything is back to normal if you upgrade Thunderbird 24.1.0 (not a typo, I repeat: 24.1.0) from Ubuntu repositories and then upgrade your add-ons from within Thunderbird (Tools/Add-ons and \"Check for updates\" from the options button next to the add-on search field) or manually by downloading 2.6.2 from here.\n(Not a problem with calendar database even when it \"dissapeared\" or became non-functional while recent Lightning-Thunderbird versions incompatibilities lasted)\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn’t recognize Wacom Bamboo Eraser I have just connected Wacom Bamboo CTL-470K-RUPL to my Ubuntu 13.04 (up-to-date 10/26/2013).

The problem is that every time tput sc is called, it overwrites the previous saved position.\nIs there a way to save more positions, e.g. tput sc pos1 and tput sc pos2 which can be restored with, say, tput rc pos1 and tput rc pos2 respectively? (The solution need not make use of tput, I mentioned it because it's the only command I know that handles cursor position)\nIf not, is there a way to at least save the cursor position locally in a function, so that if a function uses tput sc and then calls another function that runs again tput sc, then each function restores its own saved cursor position when invoking tput rc?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can use the following function to extract current cursor position in a simple array:\nextract_current_cursor_position () {\n    export $1\n    exec < /dev/tty\n    oldstty=$(stty -g)\n    stty raw -echo min 0\n    echo -en \"\\033[6n\" > /dev/tty\n    IFS=';' read -r -d R -a pos\n    stty $oldstty\n    eval \"$1[0]=$((${pos[0]:2} - 2))\"\n    eval \"$1[1]=$((${pos[1]} - 1))\"\n}\n\n(the source of code used in this function was taken and adapted from this answer)\nNow, for example, to save current cursor position in pos1, use:\nextract_current_cursor_position pos1\n\nTo save current cursor position in pos2, use:\nextract_current_cursor_position pos2\n\nTo see cursor positions saved in pos1 and pos2, you can use:\necho ${pos1[0]} ${pos1[1]}\necho ${pos2[0]} ${pos2[1]}\n\nTo move/restore cursor position to pos1, you have to use:\ntput cup ${pos1[0]} ${pos1[1]}\n\nTo move/restore cursor position to pos2, you have to use:\ntput cup ${pos2[0]} ${pos2[1]}\n\n\nA: tput command works through terminal control sequences, listed here: http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~tapted/ansi.html There is a sequence for extracting current position (Query Cursor Position - \\e[6n) and looks like it's not present in tput. To extract it use:\nstty -echo; echo -n $'\\e[6n'; read -d R x; stty echo; echo ${x#??}\n30;1\n\nNow you can extract row position saved in $x to some other variable and move your cursor using tput cup later:\n$ echo $my_saved_pos\n12\n$ tput cup $my_saved_pos 0\n\n\nA: tput was mentioned with a ?, so consider ANSI codes movement codes:\n\n\n*\n\n*$'\\e[s' - Saves current position\n\n*$'\\e[u' - Restores previous position\n\n\nExample:\n$ printf \"\\e[s\\e[6CWORLD\\e[uHELLO\\n\"\nHELLO WORLD\n\n", "Q: Changing in pavucontrols tab \"Recording\" via command line I'm using pavucontrol to make changes in the \"Recording\".

This causes GParted (and the Ubuntu installer, for that matter) to show the partition table as being empty. See my Web page on this topic for more information. If the computer really is booting Windows in BIOS mode (which would be highly unusual for a computer that ships with Windows 8), my FixParts program may be able to fix the problem fairly easily; however, it could be that the problem is caused by leftover RAID data or some other problem.\nThis type of problem makes me think that the installation may have been adjusted before you got the computer. For instance, if it was an \"open-box\" special, it could be that the original buyer re-installed Windows in BIOS mode before returning it. This would account for most of the symptoms you report. If this is the case, I recommend completely wiping the hard disk and re-installing Windows yourself, since you don't know what malware that previous buyer might have left behind (intentionally or not). See here for a discussion of legal ways to obtain Windows 8 installation media, if you need them.\nOne more point: It's my understanding that WUBI has been deprecated. Furthermore, it was always intended for quick temporary or demonstration installations, not for \"serious\" use. Therefore, I recommend avoiding WUBI. Do a conventional dual-boot installation instead.\n", "Q: How to update Ubuntu from terminal using tor? My college has a download limit, so I am not able to update my system.

All I really know for sure is that the above command works.\nAny pointers to really clear, noob-level instructions for me?\n\nA: Your array is probably reassembled either automatically (by looking at the metadata on the disks) or in the /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf file.\nLVM, which lives on top of that, is initialized automatically as well. \nTo just have a certain volume mounted at boot is simply adding an entry in /etc/fstab, e.g.:\n/dev/vgname/lvname      /path/to/mountpoint     ext4    defaults         0      2\n\nRead the fstab(5) manpage for more information on the exact settings (man fstab).

It's not very useful to think in terms of watts per hour.  Power measured in watts is an instantaneous value and is nothing to with time.   It is useful to think in terms of watt hours however.\nA watt hour is is the energy that would be consumed if your computer consumed 1 watt continuously for 1 hour (or 2 watts for half an hour).

So I cannot say that it'll definitively work on this model without any problem. You need to install and see. If you face any problem just ask to the community. You can find all kind of drivers or answers for your questions. \nAccording to Ubuntu, it works on some Asus models %100.

I have a brand new 13.10 install and I want all this shopping spyware nonsense gone. Searching for \"Ubuntu shopping spyware nonsense\" led me to apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping but I don't actually see a unity-lens-shopping package. How do I remove shopping searches in 13.10?\nUpdate: Is there any way to distinguish the scopes that search remote servers (Ebay, Amazon, AskUbuntu) from the ones that search my local computer? Or do I have to go through them all?\n\nA: There's now a GUI for doing this.\nOpen \"System Settings\" (type that in the Dash). Then go to \"Security and Privacy\". Then \"Search\". Then set the \"include on-line search results\" to off. \nDisclaimer: It seems likely that this prevents the system from phoning home with everything typed in to Dash, but I'm not positive of this. \n\nA: It turns out that Fix Ubuntu has the solution:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Figure out the version of Ubuntu that you're running\nV=`/usr/bin/lsb_release -rs`;\n\n# The privacy problems started with 12.10, so earlier versions should do nothing\nif [ $V \\< 12.10 ]; then\n  echo \"Good news!

Ubuntu 13.10 comes with a feature called Unity Smart Scopes (or \"100 scopes\") which uses a huge list of scopes to display results in Dash and among these, there are some used for shopping.

I wanted to start a fresh, please advice\n\nA: In the VirtualBox Manager interface, right-click on the virtual machine you want to remove and just hit Remove... and select Delete all files from the dialog.\n\nA: The file that contains a certain virtual machine (like the Ubuntu machine you are trying to get rid of), are completely separate from the Virtual Box software. So you shouldn't need to uninstall/reinstall that. \nProbably what is happening is that you just deleted the Virtual Machine from the virtual box interface.\nTo completely remove the files, go to the virtual box manager. On the left you will have listed your Ubuntu installation. Click right on that. Then click 'Remove'. Then choose the option 'Delete all files'\nYou probably forgot to do that last one, the previous time.\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Move data from one drive to another drive I am using Ubuntu 12.10 as a LiveCD in-order to move data from one drive to another drive because my previous OS crashed and I don't have my files backed up.

The good news is that ubuntu changed this laptop from a doorstop to a nice machine for software development. The bad news is that it may not be nice enough. While running \"make\" to build a version of Audacity, it shuts off suddenly and completely, as if I held the power button down. It boots back up OK, but I have to run \"make clean\" and start the make over again because of the partial .o files left by the shut-down.

How ubuntu handle that?\nthank you so much for your opinions. \n-Kobe\n\nA: I can only answer a couple questions as myself am curious about if ubuntu will warn me.\nHere is what I know so far, if the RAID is degraded, ubuntu will tell you on the next startup and will ask you if you want to continue.\nUbuntu will keep running if one of the drives fail, but in a DEGREADED state, this is very bad and you should shut off all services you don't need writng/reading to the disks because if another drive fails, your data is essentially gone.\nAlso for the RAM situation, 4GB should be good, but install htop [sudo apt-get install htop] and every so often check to see if the RAM is at it's max and if it is, just add more in. The more the better :)\nSorry I could not help you with the automatic process of recovering the RAID or if ubuntu shows you if it is degraded while in operation.\n\nA: Ubuntu (the Linux kernel) can handle both RAID-1 or RAID-5.\n\n\n*\n\n*Either of them can tolerate the failure of one disk.\n\n*It will also tell you which drive is no longer in function.\n\n*Yes the recovery process is automatic: all you have to do is to add a new disk to your degraded (i.e., faulty) RAID array.\n\n\nYou can even grow your RAID-5 array that is add new disks to it to increase its capcaity (it might be a bit complicated and time-consuming but possible anyway).\n", "Q: How to install Pulseaudio on ubuntu 13.10 I uninstalled pulseaudio because I was going to use alsa but I am having problems with that too.

However DVDs and CDs should still be mounted with their label as the mount point in /media or /media/$USER.\nIf something is odd, like the USB ROM storage of a USB modem got assigned as your first ODD, or you just want to customize, you can edit lines or remove all lines after the initial comment in the corresponding udev rule, which can be edited viaowing command from terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules\n\nChanges apply after reboot, as well as does reconfiguration.\n", "Q: Problems while installing Ubuntu on HP Envy 17-j050 I had several issues while trying to install Ubuntu (x64) on the new laptop that I just bought: HP Envy 17-j050ex (specs).\nI will not raising the common issues about dual-boot, secure boot, setting the brightness during install, downloading drivers, and the other related issues that are relatively \"easy\" to google and solve.\n\n\n*\n\n*The most annoying problem is that latest Ubuntu version that can be installed on it is 12.04! All newer version installers hanged in the middle of the \"trial\" most of the time with no information at all and some times with the information that the \"no screen found\" error.\n\n*Even after installing the 12.04 many issues are still not solved:\n2.1. Wireless (Ralink RT3290) is disabled by hardware switch: I tried the rfkill unblock all, rebooting with the rescue mode and even going into windows to try to enable the wireless. The only hardware switch on my laptop is the F12 key that is not working at all in enabling/disabling under Ubuntu (but works on Win8)\n2.2. The nVidia GeForce 750M is not detected/installed correctly even after installing the nvidia-current nor downloading the NVIDIA*.run and installing it from root.\n2.3. The brightness cannot be changed using the Fn keys F2 and F3 while the volume up/down/mute (F7/F8/F6) is working along with the keyboard backlight (F5). And if I try to toggle the WiFi on/off, these function button stop working unless I restart X.\nPlease let me know if my week long research missed the ways to solve these issues. Thanks for your time.\n***EDIT: After updating the wireless drivers from the Win8 HP support app, it seemed that the wireless is up and running without any other intervention what so ever!

The problem is that  laptop's power button is right on the edge of the bezel making it far too easy to press accidentally, in my opinion a design fault by Sony.\nAt present, when I press the power button it shuts down strait away and as you can imagine, when I'm accidentally pressing it all the time it gets very annoying! So I planned to change it to ask what I would like to do when I press it or at least ask if I'm sure.\nSo I went through the xfce GUI options \"Settings Manager\" - \"Power Manager\" to the field \"When power button is pressed\", but it was already set to \"Ask\". So I did some digging and found a thread telling me to navigate to /etc/xdg/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-power-manager.xml where it said to find power-button-action and check that  value=\"3\". It already did.\nSo I looked some more and found this thread which focuses on acpi scripts. I tried solution 1 & 2 using sudoedit to change the files accordingly (I have made executable bash shell scripts already so I think I followed them correctly), but still no difference. \nI also found this thread which instructed me to edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf so that HandlePowerKey=ignore. Still no luck.\nI even tried my own approach to completely disable /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh by renaming it powerbtn.sh.bak hoping for at least no response from the power button... and I have done many reboots in between... but still it shuts down!\nI have also read that some people have the file /etc/acpi/events/power_button, but I do not.\nSo does anyone have any other ideas? What else could be executing the shutdown sequence Is there something I'm missing?\nI haven't undone any of these actions so every one of the above files is currently edited on my computer, with the exception that \"Solution 2\" automatically undone \"Solution 1\" above. \nThanks guys.\n\nA: Thanks @crysman, I believe it is indeed the bug you mentioned.\nTo @Gully.Moy:\nThanks for reporting.

My web apps have nothing to do with the 'system architecture'.\nHence, /usr/share/www/ looks like a great place to store web apps and serve from, as opposed to /var/www/. I am aware apache server's convention is to store in /var/, but I'm using a different server and even if I was using apache, I don't mind stepping on this particular convention's toes.\nMy question is, any compelling arguments against using this directory?\n\nA: There's nothing forcing you to use either. You can define where you want your files to live. Some people move them under their user accounts, some people create a /srv/ directory...

After upgrading to 13.10, I am now getting a prompt for my gmail password every time I log in. There is no indication as to which service or application needs this information. If I enter the correct password I'm told it is incorrect. My gmail account does not use two factor authentication. The problem has only started after an upgrade from 13.04 to 13.10.\nHow can I prevent this prompt appearing, and/or what is doing the prompting?\n\nA: I was facing the same issue and got rid of it by just removing the evolution and goa-1.0 folders from my ~/.config.\n\nA: Well I haven't managed to find out exactly why I'm getting asked for the password, but I've managed to stop it happening. I renamed my ~/.config directory and then let the logout/login process create a new one. Then by a long process of copying entries from my old .config to my new one, I've found out that the problem lies somewhere in the three directories evolution, desktop-couch and goa-1.0. As the prompt has stopped and I don't use evolution ( and I don't know what desktop-couch or goa-1.0 are) I've left it at that.\nHopefully this will let someone else fix their system and/or explain what is going on.\n\nA: Thank you, thank you guys, this is the only solution that worked for me - I tried the other dead-ends:\nremving all \"keyring\" folders from \"~/.config\"; using \"seahorse\" to try to change the \"Login\" password to match my Ubuntu password. None of these worked, in particular, you cannot change the \"Login\" password in \"seahorse\" without knowing the \"Old\" password and it seems that seahorse doesn't know what that is either, because I tried all my known passwords.\nSo the answer for me was:\nrm -rf ~/.config/goa-1.0\n\nand I suspect that the offending directory is the \"goa-1.0\" one, because after I deleted the \"evolution\" one and rebooted, I still got the keyring / gmail password prompt, but then I deleted them both (the evolution one had reappeared) and voila the prompt disappeared.\nThanks guys.\n", "Q: Bluetooth refuses to connect since update to Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 I can no longer connect to my bluetooth speakers since since upgrading to Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 and then Gnome shell to 3.10, which never were a problem with Ubuntu Gnome 13.04.\nMy bluetooth-dongle seems to working fine and I can even detect and add the speakers (Creative D100) but when I try to slide the button from off to on in the bluetooth settings it just slides back to off.

If not, do so. If that doesn't help, go ahead and install rEFInd from Windows, or try using the rEFInd USB flash drive or CD-R. (The latter is safer, in that it won't write anything to your hard disk or modify your NVRAM settings, so if it doesn't work there won't be any non-functional stuff left behind.) Note that rEFInd requires extra configuration to work with Secure Boot, so if you want to use rEFInd with Secure Boot enabled, you'll need to jump through those extra hoops.\n\nA: Use EasyBCD on the Windows side to point back the the Windows boot record.\nUse boot-repair on the Ubuntu side to point the grub location.

Thanks in advance!\n\nA: You have a UEFI machine, so things have changed a bit.  You need a 64 bit version 12.04.2 or later.  Unfortunately, some of these changes are not handled properly by the grub installer yet.  Booting now has a special partition just for bootloaders, which are just files, instead of being a special place on the disk.  This partition on the hard disk, called the EFI partition, really does not need to change at all, since you can put the Ubuntu bootloader right on the external hard disk, in its own EFI partition.  First things first, backup the existing EFI partition -- They're just files, but restoring them from a backup usb is far easier than restoring Windows.\n  It might be possible to switch modes UEFI/legacy and boot an external msdos partitioned disk, but it would be far more convenient to just leave things in UEFI mode regardless of what you run.  On your external hard disk, (assuming there's nothing there now, otherwise backup first), delete everything and remake the partition table as a gpt partition table instead of msdos.  The first parition make a 300M FAT (Meg, it's small!) EFI partition.  use gparted, which understands gpt partitioning.  Next put boot, then root, swap and home.  gpt partitions are all primary, so no need to worry about extended/logical partitions.\n  You can set the EFI boot files up manually, or see what the installer does after seeing a gpt disk and a real EFI target partition.  (you should give the actual EFI partition as the location for the bootloader instead of the disk as previously done, but the installer may still just ignore that and put the ubuntu files into the hard disk's EFI.  The new files will all be under /EFI/ubuntu.  You can copy everything  to the target's EFI partition if that happens.  Now, since the target is \"removable media\", the acutal bootloader is uses is NOT the one in /EFI/ubuntu, but is in /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.  You choose which bootloader you want, either shim.efi (for secure boot), or grubx64.efi if you can actually boot Windows without secure boot.  Rename the bootloader to \"bootx64.efi\".  If you are using shim for the bootloader, you will also need a (signed) copy of grubx64.efi in the same /EFI/Boot directory. (Look in /usr/lib/grub (?) for the signed version of grub, its name ends in \".signed\".  Now you just need a grub.cfg file in /EFI/ubuntu and you should be able to boot.  12.04 may not have gotten the grub.cfg file update which just pulls in the maintained grub.cfg from /boot/grub, but to get things started, just a full copy of the file will do.\nOther bad things the grub installer does may not actually happen to you since you don't have a copy of ubuntu on the hard disk (nor in NVRAM).\nGood Luck\n", "Q: Where is the gtk# widget for windows forms in mono?

So with that notion I'm studying shell scripting.\nI've hit a snag in ubuntu using the latest version 13.10 Saucy. When I use the select command in a sh script it doesn't work, depending on how I format the command it will either return Unexpected \"do\" or Unexpected \"done\". See the following two examples: \nThis section of code produces an unexpected \"do\" error:\n#/bin/bash\nPS3='Please enter your choice'\nselect opt in option1 option2 option3 quit\ndo\n     case $opt in\n       \"option1\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 1\" ;;\n        \"option2\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 2\" ;;\n        \"option3\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 3\" ;;\n        \"quit\")\n            break ;;\n        *) echo invalid option ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\nThis section of code produces an unexpected \"done\" error. \n#/bin/bash\nPS3='Please enter your choice'\nselect opt in option1 option2 option3 quit ; do\n     case $opt in\n       \"Option1\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 1\" ;;\n        \"Option2\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 2\" ;;\n        \"Option3\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 3\" ;;\n        \"quit\")\n            break ;;\n        *) echo invalid option ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\nWhen I enter these parameters into the command line interactively or manually I get the desired result which is a list of choices to choose from. However when executed from a script I get the before mentioned errors. Also a side note I have tried this in Fedora as a script and it worked perfectly! Is there something I need to do differently or a setting in a configuration file I need to check? Am I the only one having this issue? \n\nA: The Syntax error: \"do\" unexpected or Syntax error: \"done\" unexpected errors are almost certainly because you are trying to run your script by typing\nsh yourscript\nwhich overrides the #!/bin/bash directive and forces the script to be run in the /bin/sh interpreter - which by default is a symlink to /bin/dash, which doesn't support the select syntax. You should just make the script executable\nchmod +x yourscript\nand then invoke it as\n./yourscript\nThe other obvious problem is that your option list uses lower case option1 option2 option3 but your case statement tests for Option1 Option2 Option3 - it should be\n#/bin/bash\nPS3='Please enter your choice '\nselect opt in option1 option2 option3 quit; do\n     case \"$opt\" in\n       \"option1\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 1\" ;;\n       \"option2\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 2\" ;;\n       \"option3\")\n            echo \"you chose choice 3\" ;;\n       \"quit\")\n            break ;;\n       *) echo invalid option ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n", "Q: Wireless device bug on 13.10.

Sometimes the the entire bluetooth stack has vanished alltogether.\nWhat changed with the bluetooth between these versions, that may cause this?\nThis is a fresh install of Kubuntu I'm using (bluedevil) no an upgrade, but the same hardware as 13.04 was happy on.\nI have reported this as a bug \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/1246981\nand added the link here as requested.\n\nA: Don't want to resurrect an old question but I had this same issue in Arch and now in Ubuntu 14.04. I've been able to find a permanent work around on both systems. For those Googling for a solution this is what worked for me. Your mileage may vary. For Ubuntu I follow instruction from the BluetoothSetup wiki page specifically the instruction for 11.04.

I believe they are what make the connect permanent. Their order is important it they just need to ran together.\n\nA: What I am doing now is selecting the mouse on the bluetooth icon  and click on disconnect, after the bluetooth icon blinks I do connect and the mouse works again.\n\nA: The Bluetooth Manager utility seems to do a better job of pairing with the mouse. I believe that, as you can see in Atalaia's answer, the step of trusting the device is important, and the built in bluetooth tools don't always do that correctly.\nInstall the blueman package, run the \"Bluetooth Manager\" application, completely remove the mouse, pair it again, and mark it as trusted.

This repository is maintained by the community, or in this case by Debian. So, if you want more updated package, for whatever reason, you should use manual methods. BTW, the package is only 2 releases behind 0.13.2 -> 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1 trough the changes were extensive I don't expect the maintainer testing one by one each commit and check what could get broken.\nSame with Matplotlib, only 2 releases behind but there were several changes between each version, and maintainers have better things to do that bringing bleeding edge, since the selling point of Ubuntu is stability over everything. If something imply several testing (and more with low priority package) it will take a while to bring the latest. This could be more lucky in the next releases since Debian has the 1.3.1 version in sid/unstable repositories. Maybe for the next Ubuntu release cycle.\nHow to install the bleeding edge?

Eventually, i'll add SMB sharing to the RAID1 array as well, but migrating the user home folders to the array is primary concern.\nHow can i set this up?\n\nA: You just mount the file system on the RAID array via UUID in /etc/fstab as /home.

I just set up a MAAS server and have hard drives within the physical server that I want to configure as nodes. How do I add them  either through web interface or manually via the command line?\n\nA: MaaS is designed as a tool for managing multiple physical machines, not multiple hard drives. (If your goal is to manage hard drives, then there are tools that do not require MaaS).\nIf you have a powerful enough server, you could use virtualization software like KVM or Virtualbox to create a couple of virtual machines, which you could then manage with MaaS. The only reason I can see to do this though is to test MaaS -- if you are trying to manage many (or even just a few) virtual machines, there are easier ways to do it, like Libvirt.\n(I know my answer doesn't have a ton of specifics, but that is because I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish, or what you end goal is).\n", "Q: How to block all the interrupts in linux I am working on a python project, Where i am displaying a graphical window with log in screen, I've also disabled the close, re size and minimize buttons\nMy problem:\nI have to disable all the interrupts, including disabling system shortcuts like alt + tab, alt + f4 etc, so that user can log in only after entering the username and passwords on the screen. \nIs there any linux command or any bash script is there ? \n\nplatform : ubuntu\n\nThanks for any help !\n\nA: If use the following commands:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 64 = \"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 108 = \"\n\nboth Alt (left and right) will be disabled/blocked. In the same mode you can disable Tab, respectively F4:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 23 = \"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 70 = \"\n\nTo enable them back to their normal behavior, use:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  64 = Alt_L Meta_L Alt_L Meta_L\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 108 = Alt_R Meta_R Alt_R Meta_R\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  23 = Tab ISO_Left_Tab Tab ISO_Left_Tab\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  70 = F4 F4 F4 F4 F4 F4 XF86Switch_VT_4\"\n\nUse xmodmap -pke command to see all keycodes and their map assignment.\n", "Q: Crashplan won't install properly I have downloaded an application called CrashPlan for backups.

It was having IDM (Internet download Manager) from which I was able to download almost all the types of files from the internet. I was also able to download online streaming videos by the help of IDM. It was really helpful for me regarding the downloading. I was also able to resume my downloads which were paused or stopped due to some reason.\nSo, I would like to ask that whether there is any software in Ubuntu form which I could get these functions and if there is any software, then how to download it.\nI am a new user in Ubuntu. I am using Kubuntu 13.04.\n\nA: \nuGet is by far the best download manager for Linux because it has a ton of powerful features while at the same time is very lightweight in resource usage. uGet is just as fast as IDM. Unlike some of the other options on Linux, uGet is completely Open Source and does not limit the user for any reason.\nFor easily downloading videos from streaming sites you should look at FlashGot - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashgot/?src=search\n\nA: I recommend flareget.Flareget is the best download manager program for linux.Its speed was high as compared to IDM in windows.\nDownload and install flareget from http://flareget.com/download/\n\nA: I think GetJet Download is Good one, Try it Download Getjet\n\n", "Q: Can I format a pendrive after making it bootable If I make a pendrive bootable with Ubuntu 13.10, after installing can I format the pendrive and use it like before as a storage device?\n\nA: How to change your bootable pendrive into a 'normal' pendrive\nI don't think you need to reformat your pendrive. Just select all files and delete them. You might want to delete with Shift+Delete so the space is really freed.\nYou can remove hte boot flag from your pendrive as to indicate the BIOS that it doesn't need to try to boot from it. You will need gparted for that, which isn't installed by default. To it from the terminal, open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+t. From there issue the command\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nOnce it's installed start gparted with sudo rights\nsudo gparted\n\nGparted opens up showing you the partitions of your first drive. There is a combo-box in the top right, find for your pendrive. Once you've found it, right-click the partition and select Manage flags and un-check boot. Click Close. The changes take effect immediately.\n\nA: Yes you can format the pendrive and use it like a storage device by formatting it to FAT32 filesystem.Using Gparted partition Editor on ubuntu,you can Format the pendrive to FAT32 filesystem.\n", "Q: Speakers and Headphones play at the same time. Lenovo ThinkPad Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. They worked fine until just a couple hours ago, and I see the other threads but they don't have solutions. None of 20 I must have looked at. \nI looked at Alsamixer, but there is no auto-mute option. No matter how many times I hit the right arrow key. Muting the speakers mutes both the headphones and the speakers.\nMy headphones do not show up in the Sound Settings Output.\nAny way to mute the speakers without muting the headphones would be appreciated. The speakers don't have to unmute when I unplug the headphones. Not physically breaking the speakers, but it might come to that.\nI won't be able to follow instructions that aren't explicit, sorry. Thanks for anyone's time.\n\nA: On my Lenovo G700 the combination microphone / headphone jack (\"combo audio jack\") does not automatically mute when plugging in headphones. The workaround for this is pretty low-level and you will need to be very comfortable with admin-ing your machine. Here is how to do it:\nFirst download and build the \"hda-verb\" binary, which is a low-level debugging tool:\nftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/tiwai/misc/hda-verb-0.4.tar.gz\n\nNext take a look at your sound card's codec information under \"/proc/asound\". For my setup this was the command:\n$ less /proc/asound/card0/codec#0\n\nLook for the node number that has \"OUT EAPD Balanced\" or \"Speaker at Int ATAPI\" labels. On my setup, this was the node \"0x0d\".\nNow look for your sound card's device path under \"/dev/snd\". Experiment with anything that has a name like \"/dev/snd/hwC0D0\", which was my setup.\nRun this command to mute the internal speakers:\n$ sudo hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x0d SET_CONN 1\n\nHere you want to replace the \"0x0d\" with whatever node number you found above, and you will want to experiment with different device paths if necessary. Use \"SET_CONN 0\" at the end to unmute the internal speakers. If you have done this right, the headphone audio output will not change.\nI created \"mute_internal_speakers\" and \"unmute_internal_speakers\" scripts to simplify this.\n", "Q: \"Could not connect to wicd's D-Bus interface. Check the wicd log for error messages.\" I am currently making use of a Wired Broadband. By default NetworkManager shows that the Auto Ethernet is connected. I was unable to browse through any websites in the browser. I had to disconnect & connect the Auto Ethernet several times in NetworkManager or restart Ubuntu to get it fixed. But following these steps is quiet annoying as this issue happens very frequently.\nI browsed through the Internet and got to know that WICD Network Manager fixes this issue. Earlier I have been using Ubuntu 12.04 where the same issue was fixed by making use of WCID Network Manager.\nRecently I upgraded to 13.10 and as I got the same network issue in default NetworkManager, I have installed WICD NetworkManager but when I try to open WCID, I get an alert message saying,\nCould not connect to wicd's D-Bus interface. Check the wicd log for error messages.\n\nWhen I click on OK, I get the same message again and when I click on OK again I get the following message,\nError connecting to wicd service via D-Bus. Please ensure the wicd service is running.\n\nAny help to fix this issue is greatly appreciated as this issue was annoying me since I installed 13.10\n\nA: This might be a symptom of this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wicd/+bug/1132529\nThe solution that worked for me was to run the following commands from the command line (see comment #22 from above link):\nsudo service wicd stop\nrm /etc/resolv.conf\nrm /var/lib/wicd/resolv.conf.orig\nln -s /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /var/lib/wicd/resolv.conf.orig\nsudo service wicd start\n\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Google Chrome will not exit fullscreen mode I am running 64-bit Ubuntu 13.10, have latest stable google-chrome version 30.0.1599.114-1.

I was moved to keep looking. The solution was simple and intuitive (but it required false starts and force quits to realize it with a seemingly frozen keyboard):\nIf you use a screen saver with password protection, and you leave the computer in full-screen mode after leaving for work (or falling asleep binge-wacthing Netflix), you must enter your password in order to regain control. In full screen there's no visible dialogue box (it's hidden behind the full screen application). \nTry first- before clicking on anything, just type in your password. If you see the cursor turn into a spinning wheel, just wait for your password to be verified. Then you will be able to click on the navigation buttons again. \nTry second- however, most of the time I have to blindly alt-tab in order to give the password dialogue the focus, so that I can enter my password.(There's no way to tell which application is right behind the full screen application, so you might have to alt-tab and re-enter the password several times. Persevere, this works. there's no need to modify the settings or crawl the code if this works for you.)\nThe easiest way to prevent this is to avoid leaving the computer in full screen mode, but this is an effective solution if you fall asleep watching Downton Abbey. \nI have verified this on Chrome Version 48.0.2564.109 (64-bit) on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n", "Q: Package 'openbsd-inetd' has no installation candidate When I try to install openbsd-inetd, it shows \nroot@amsys-G41MT-S2PT:/home/amsys# sudo apt-get install openbsd-inetd\nReading package lists...

Unfortunately Dropbox can only upload and download as fast as your internet service provider\n(ISP) allows. Consumer ISP's normally provide 1/10th the upload speed\ncompared to download speed.

Manually loading with 'modprobe ath9k' doesn't help.\nHow do I get this card working on Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit?\n\nA: I realised that the driver does indeed work, just not as I expected. \nFrom observing Ubuntu's network indicator over the week I noticed that WiFi will spontaneously \"just work\". Often after a few hours of using Ubuntu the WiFi will just start working randomly. This is impractical but it does work.\nSo, I guess that answers my question. I just have a different sort of question in my hands now.\n", "Q: Use a terminal as desktop background instead of the wallpaper I have come to a conclusion that all my needs from nautilus are satisfied with the terminal and last file manager. It also dismisses the need for multiple nautilus instances, which makes mess when I forget how I'm meant to use different workspaces.\nThe next step for my simplification would be to get rid of any possibility to open nautilus. Also I thought that my interaction with computer is file centered, therefore it makes sense to leave file manager in background of applications.\nAre there any ways to make terminal as desktop background with which I could interact? \n\nA: Well that's an interesting problem.\nThis is quite simple in KDE, you just set up a special window assignment (right click the title bar) to make the terminal fullscreen, below all other windows, drawn without window decorations and to skip the taskbar. It works beautifully.\nUnder Compiz you can achieve a similar effect with CCSM with its Window Rules plugin. The problem you have is differentiating between a terminal you might load up subsequently and the one you load on boot. It might make sense to install another terminal application (Terminator is a fine choice) and just use that for your desktop. Then you can tell CCSM to change the window settings on all Terminator instances.\nIn both cases you can leave the desktop as it is. It'll be there, but it'll be obscured by the terminal.\n\nAnother way you could do this (using the same ideas as above but cross-platform) is to use wmctrl to set the hints rather than leaving it up to the Window Manager.\nThe following three commands will set the current window to cover the desktop.\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,fullscreen\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,below\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,skip_taskbar\n\nYou can either save that in a script or you can munge it all together in a lovely messy one-liner. Annoyingly, wmctrl can only do two hint changes at a time so it's a little more bloated than one might like.\ngnome-terminal -x sh -c \"wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,fullscreen,below;wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,skip_taskbar;bash\"\n\nOther terminal emulators will work like this but they might have a different argument for running something (vs the -x that gnome-terminal and terminator use). konsole uses -e, for example.\n\nA: Curious request, I think you'd be happier disabling the desktop then using a drop down terminal like Guake.\nDisabling the desktop\nPrevent Nautilus from handling the desktop with this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\n\nUsing Guake\nYou may be better off just using a drop down terminal like Guake.

It's very configurable, offering transperancy options, size options and colour options among others.\nIf you don't like Guake, there are plenty more drop terminals, but Guake is my choice.\n\nReference:\n\n*\n\n*How to disable nautilus from handling the desktop?\n", "Q: Synaptic corrupted, not able to install anything even from terminal my synaptic is not working. whenever i open it, i find that it is corrupted and asks me to run dpkg ---configure -a whenever i run it on root terminal, it starts downloading 1 GB files and there is written \"48h 22m left\" or something like that. i don't want to download that file. please help\n\nA: it seems that you stopped the process of installing/upgrading prematurely, so package manager wants to correct the situation.

I'm not worry about ventilation and electricity. \n\nA: Turbo-boost is on \"all the time\" by default in the default ondemand CPU governor.\nBut that doesn't mean the clock speed is always the turbo boost's level all the time and certainly not for all cores. Turbo boost allows the CPU to scale up one or two cores (depending on the CPU) to an overclocked level on demand. This will happen in Ubuntu.\nWhat you can't (and shouldn't) do is try to turbo boost while overclocking. I'm not even sure it's possible. You'd be mixing two things that shouldn't be mixed.\nBut what you can do is set a manual overclock in your BIOS. CPU scaling will probably still happen but that isn't an issue because ondemand is just as fast as the performance governor in most situations. You can set it if you wish.\n", "Q: 13.04 -> 13.10 = black screen after GRUB, before login I'm fairly new to Linux so fancy lingo will need explaining :-)\nUpdating Ubuntu from 13.04 to 13.10 has resulted in a black screen after selecting Ubuntu in GRUB.

There's also no \"Previous Linux Versions\" option/submenu under GRUB. \nIs there any way of updating the kernel from the recovery menu? Or rolling it back? Or is it a completely separate issue? \nHelp appreciated.\n\nA: Fixed it. Turns out it was an issue of my own creation with /etc/fstab. These are the steps I took to fix it: \n1) Boot into Ubuntu's recovery mode and select the option that provides access to the root shell/terminal/command-line. \n2) Enter the following to provide write access to the drive (incl/ crucially fstab): \n#mount -n -o remount,rw /\n\n3) Next you'll want to open fstab in nano (think of nano as the shell equivalent of gedit): \n#nano /etc/fstab\n\n4) Remove whatever you added there to cause the problem or comment it out with a hash (#). Hit Ctrl+X, then Y, then ENTER, or whatever other combination of keys (there's a guide at the bottom) allows you to save and write the changes and exit. \n5) Enter the following to cleanly reboot.

UBod's answer), mainly because it means you have to apply the hack again and again each time you update Cairo dock.\nI came up with a (in my opinion) cleaner workaround, which I also posted at the bug report.

It shows as an item displaying your name with a speech bubble beside it.\nThe nifty thing is that this item also got menu points for Switch user, Log out and Power off (the latter of which lets you choose between Supend, Restart and Shutdown), and these work, as opposed to the same entries of the \"default\" gear-wheel item in the upper right corner of the panel.\n\nA: Though I am not the one who came up with this workaround, it might still be useful for readers of this thread to know about it (posted on https://bugs.launchpad.net/cairo-dock-core/+bug/1242112 by user \"Fabounet\"):\nedit /usr/lib/cairo-dock/cairo-dock-launcher-API-daemon as root\nadd the following line at line 33:\nfrom time import sleep\nand the following line at line 241 (just before ULWatcher()):\nsleep(5)\n\nBTW, I use a x86_64 system.

I don't need to write everything twice on the computer.) Also it seems a little difficult to manage the thinking about creating the notation and thinking about the problem at the same time. The way I do LaTex right now, I don't see my results in real-time and sometimes I have formatting mistakes, that keep me from thinking about the problem itself.

A few approaches spring to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*The generic EFI user interface provided by Tianocore includes options to load drivers. This interface is used by VirtualBox and DUET, but the only hardware I know of that uses it is the Minnowboard. I've never seen a similar option in a regular PC, so as a practical matter this is unlikely to work. (I've also never tested this feature, so I don't know if it would properly bind the drivers once they're loaded.)\n\n*You could experiment with efibootmgr in Linux and/or bcfg in an EFI shell to load the driver from a FAT partition as the first boot option, with gummiboot on the ext2fs partition as a second option. I'm skeptical that this would bind the driver to the filesystem(s), though, so I suspect this wouldn't work. I might be wrong, though. If it did work, the driver would load and exit, and the EFI would then launch gummiboot.\n\n*An EFI shell script could load the driver, bind it to the filesystem(s), and then launch any program you like from the ext2fs partition. I'm pretty confident that this would work. On most computers, you'd need to install an EFI shell program as the default boot program. The big problem is that the EFI shell binaries I've seen all seem to impose a delay on startup to give you the option to not run the startup.nsh startup script, so this would slow down the boot process.\n\n*You could write a custom program that loads the driver, binds it to your filesystem(s), and then launches whatever program you like. In fact, rEFInd can do this job; however, that would be overkill, and the question then becomes: Why use rEFInd to launch gummiboot? If you have the skill to write the customized program, it would almost certainly be easier to modify gummiboot to load the ext2fs driver and then launch a kernel from an ext2fs partition.\n\n\nAll of these approaches would require putting the ext2fs driver (and an EFI shell or custom driver-loading program) on the normal FAT ESP. The only way to rid yourself of the ESP, if that's your goal, is to build your own custom firmware with built-in ext2fs support. (I suppose that could be another bullet-list item, but it would be a lot of work for a very minor benefit.)\nA logical question at this point becomes: Why do you want to use gummiboot rather than rEFInd? rEFInd has most of gummiboot's capabilities and many more of its own, so it may be that rEFInd will do what you need.

Steam runs fine in Raring, not ready for Saucy for another few months, in the meantime this repo is 404ing me every time I do an \"apt-get update\"\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-xswat/x-updates/ubuntu raring\nThis ppa is supposed to allow me to get the latest updates for my Intel Graphics card. I tried searching the net to no avail but does someone know the correct ppa for this? \nAny help is appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: The ppa you referenced is not for Steam, it is for the x-swat team.\nThe x-swat ppa is for the latest stable driver that are available for Ubuntu.  Ubuntu 13.10 just came out and as a result, it already has the latest stable drivers installed.  \nThe reason that you are getting an error on the x-swat ppa is that it is not set up yet(404 errors are \"not found\").  There would be no reason yet for there to be a 13.10 x-swat ppa, as there would be nothing to put in it.  It is also possible that they are in the process of setting it up, it takes the ppa owners some time to get the ppas set up for a new version, sometimes they have to fix bugs that pop up in the new release, which slows them down further- that is one of the drawbacks to upgrading as soon as the new release is out, many wait a few weeks or more to let these kind of issues get resolved before upgrading.\nFrom your question, I cannot tell but I assume that Steam itself is working fine(you don't specify), bu that you tried to add the x-swat ppa and now are getting this error. If you installed the ppa because Steam gave you the pop up when starting that recommended you enable that ppa, you can just disable the ppa and ignore the box for now.  I think that Steam looks to see if that ppa is enabled by default and upon not finding it will give you that box upon starting; it is likely that this only happens with Intel cards but I don't know for sure(I only use Intel so I cannot test is to be sure)\nTo make the ppa warning go away, \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Update Manager\n\n*On the lower right click on Settings\n\n*Under the Tab Other software click on the box next to the listing for the x-swat ppa\n\n*A box will pop-up asking for your password, after entering it the bos will be unchecked, disabling the ppa, there may be another line just below or above for the \"x-swat ppa (source code)\", make sure you disable it too or it will still give you the error.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could also just highlight the ppa line then click Remove instead of disabling but you would have to add it again later, either way is fine.\n\n\n*You can now close the current window.  When back on the Update Manager click on the update button to refresh your sources to complete the removal of the x-swat ppa.\nThere may be a way to get that box that pops up when Steam starts to go away, I can't remember if there is a \"Don't show this again\" button on that box or not.  If there is not, I'm not sure if you can stop it, you may have to just close it every time.\nIf you want to manually keep an eye on the x-swat ppa to see if they have added Saucy to the ppa by checking https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates  When they add it you will be able to select it in the drop down menu under \"Overview of Published Packages\" at the bottom of the page.  When Saucy is supported, you can then either re-enable the ppa or add it again, if you removed it.\n", "Q: Why is my PC so slow?

MBR is generally considered to be limited to 2TiB disks, but in fact it's limited to 2TiB values for partition start points and sizes, so it can theoretically handle just under 4TiB disks, albeit with the final 2TiB in one partition. On your 3TB (2.7TiB) disk, your largest and final partition is about 1TiB in size and begins at about 1.7TiB. It therefore is within the letter of the MBR \"law,\" but some OSes and utilities will flake out when shown this disk. In my tests, both Linux and Windows 7 handled this configuration OK, but most other OSes didn't. My tests were limited, though; it's conceivable that some utility would fail on this disk, even under Linux or Windows 7, and possibly corrupt your data. In fact, my guess is that this is what's happening to GRUB, although I'm not positive of that. Overall, I'd have to recommend the use of GPT on bigger disks.\nThat said, I realize you may be in trouble if you're trying to use a 3TB disk on an older computer with a traditional BIOS rather than an EFI. In such a case, the best option is to use an older and smaller disk as a Windows boot disk along with a secondary GPT disk to hold data, programs, and Linux. Another option is to use DUET or Clover to get the BIOS-based computer booting in EFI mode. Both DUET and Clover can be thought of as BIOS boot loaders that add EFI capabilities to a BIOS computer. Unfortunately, neither of them is easy to install, and the last time I checked, both had problems on most AMD computers. (They're more likely to work on Intel-based systems.)\nI'm not positive, but my suspicion is that the problem you're encountering is due to the fact that your boot partition extends beyond the end of the hard disk. Thus, if you really must get this working as-is, my recommendation is to rearrange your partitions so that both the Linux and Windows boot partitions reside entirely under the 2TiB mark. Use the space beyond that point for a data or programs partition.\nIf your motherboard supports EFI-mode booting, a better option is to switch to GPT and boot in EFI mode. This page covers converting Windows to boot in EFI mode. Linux tends to be a bit easier; you need only install any of several EFI boot loaders for Linux. GRUB 2 is one of these, although rEFInd is likely to be easier to install manually. Note that most computers sold since mid-2011 use EFI, although most sold prior to the release of Windows 8 booted in BIOS mode by default. Even some pre-2011 computers support EFI-mode booting.\n", "Q: hp envy 4 - dual win 8 with ubuntu I have win8 on my envy 4 ullttrabook and i want to dual win8 with ubuntU.\nI download the instulation and run it throw usb.\nBut, the installision does not recognize my hard disc ,while im in it, throw the usb.\nWhay should i do?\n\nA: Let me tell you that I don't trust HP and I think of Windows 8 is difficult and unnecessary.

(aka .exe, .app, etc.) I'm new to Ubuntu. What's the application extension for development reasons? I know Windows is mainly .exe and Mac is .dmg or .app. Does Linux have an unique one?\n\nA: In general, in Linux, and so in Ubuntu, the applications do not have extensions. Some examples: nautilus, firefox, gnome-terminal, and so on.\nApplications are usually located in these directories /usr/local/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/bin, /sbin, /bin, /usr/games, /usr/local/games and others.\nYou can determine whether a file can be an application if and only if that file is executable. Use ls -l filename, or stat filename, or file filename to determine this. If that filename have this permissions: -rwxr-xr-x, then that file is sure executable.\n\n(source of the image: http://www.csit.parkland.edu/~smauney/csc128/fig_permissions.jpg)\n\nA: In Ubuntu there is no limitation to the extension of the file . The file ending just describes what or how a file is \"executed\".\nFor example a shell script ends with .sh , an installer file ends with .deb .\n.gz for files compressed using the gzip utility ..tar - archive created with the tar files ..bz2 for files compressed with the bzip2 compression utility \nAs far as comparision with exe of Windows, in Linux nearly all files can be executable or made executable by proper permissions \nTo check if a file (This is for a file not directory as I remove \"-\" specifying it) is executable type \nls -al filename | tr -s ' ' | cut -f1 -d' ' | cut -f2 -d-\n\nYou will find a list of 9 elements with the first three specifying the permission for the owner of the file , the next specifying the permission for the groups to which the owner belongs and the last three for others .The 'x'(the executable bit) in it represents the executable permission.\nThis is departure from the way Windows treat an executable is by extension , In *nix anything can be executable. \n\nA: Extensions are file name suffixes that start with a period. Usually, they are two or three letters long.Linux can read many file extensions used by other platforms. In Linux you usually compile and run a file manually. The file can be a python script or debian software package or even .exe which can be executed using Wine\nHere is a list of some file extension\n.bz2 - compressed with the bzip2 compression utility \n.c - C language source code \n.conf and cfg - configuration file \n.d - directory containing scripts or configuration files \n.deb - Debian software package\n.gz - compressed using the gzip utility \n.java - Java source code \n.rc - run command configuration data \n.rpm - Red Hat Package Manager software package\n.so - shared object in a dynamic library\n.tar - archive created with the tar utility \n.tex - text formatted in the TeX or LaTeX formatting language \n.sh - Shell script\n.pl - Perl Script\n\nA: on linux you don't get executable directly. instead you get packages that contains the executables together with some information about the package and some configuration scripts to either compile a package optimized for your hardware or just to show where the precompiled binary should be installed and what dependencies it needs. \nthe binary haven't any extension it's only the name. but the package itself have an extension. debian, ubuntu and other ubuntu derivatives uses the extension .deb distros like fedora, centos, RHEL and opensuse uses the .rpm format. \n.deb and .rpm is the primary package formats.\nthere's also .tar.gz. when talking about software packages .tar.gz is often a source package (containing the source code).\n", "Q: How to add email address from email to existing contact Ubuntu 12.04\nI have a couple of email accounts but store my contacts on Google to sync with my phone. I am trying to setup an email client so it seamlessly integrates with my various email accounts (yahoo and gmail based) and take my contacts from Google with bidirectional sync. \nI have tried Thunderbird with a Google add on and Evolution. Both appear to work but the contacts integration is suboptimal. If I have an email from someone in my contacts list, I can only add them as a new contact rather than selecting the existing contact and updating it with the extra details. Evolution did seem to support this if I happened to type in the exact name of the contact (you can't browse your contacts) but it crashes when it tries to do it. \nAnyone have any ideas on how to make this work seemlessly?\nThanks\nLee.\n\nA: Right-click on the Email address in the mail header (e.g. in the preview pane), select \"Copy EMail address\". Then open contacts, double-click the contact you want to add the address to, and paste it. Not the easiest or most intuitive way, but the only one I know to work (just verified: still does on 12.04 ;).\n", "Q: Disable second, non-existent screen from command line My laptop adds/enables a VGA monitor called vga2 that doesn't actually exist every time I reboot, which fiddles with the mouse speed amongst other annoyances. What can I do to either stop it being enabled or automatically disable it on boot? \n\nA: You can use the following command:\nxrandr --auto\n\nIf this doesn't disable your non-existent VGA, then use the following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*First run:\nxrandr --current\n\nto get the right name of your VGA. This can be VGA, VGA-0, VGA1, VGA2 and others.\n\n*If the name of your VGA is, for example VGA2 (as you said), then run:\nxrandr --auto && xrandr --output VGA2 --off\n\nThis should disable the output of VGA2.\nSee man xrandr for more info.\nThen, if you get it to work, put the right command in a small script, make it executable and put it to run on start up. \n\nA: Following the steps suggested works really well, but I got stuck trying to make the script automatically run on start-up so I don't have to go into Terminal and turn off my non-existant monitor everytime.\nHere's how I managed to get the script to run automatically:\nOnce you've determined the code you need to run following the steps above, save just that piece of code in a plain text file. Rename the file to end in '.conf'.\nFor me this code is: xrandr --auto && xrandr --output VGA1-1 --off\nOpen Startup Applications. Click Add. Name and comment field are just for you, call it as you like. Click browse and find your '.conf' file. Then save.\nThis should now automatically run your code whenever your computer starts. Finally, at first this solution worked only most of the time for me. I realised that if I'd been using an external monitor with the laptop, then somtimes the computer switched and assigns the ghost monitor as VGA1-1 and sometimes as VGA1-2. So, in my case I ended up updating my conf file to have code turning off both VGA1-1 and VGA1-2.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 won't reboot with additional hard drive attached I have a fresh Dual Boot system (UEFI, Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.04).\nUbuntu boots fine (from a SSD on SATA Port 3).

In the first (working) boot, the hard disk is recognized and working just fine (it is formatted as NTFS). Windows boots without problems with the additional hard disk attached and reports no problems whatsoever. \nThe only way I can get Ubuntu to boot again after the first connect is to disable the SATA port in the BIOS.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*Harddrive physically detached: Both Ubuntu and Windows boot fine\n\n*Harddrive then connected: Both Ubuntu and Windows boot fine\n\n*Reboot, Hardrive connected: Ubuntu does not boot, Windows boots\n\n*Disable SATA1-Port: Ubuntu boots again\n\n*Enable SATA1- Port: Ubuntu won't boot\n\n\nIt is very strange.

How does it work? I just want to know how this command works.\nmv wordpress/* .\n\nmy guess is that it moves * meaning all files from wordpress folder to current folder.\nbut still looking for proper answer.\n\nA: Your assumption that this moves all files from the wordpress folder into the current folder you are in is correct.  (the proper terminology for a \"folder\" is actually a \"directory\", but that's just semantics, the general idea is the same)\n\nIn command line, . indicates \"This Directory\", or rather the current directory you are in.\nThe mv command is the \"move\" command.  The wordpress/* indicates that the folder you are inside has another folder called wordpress in it, and is directing the system to move all files and folders that are within the wordpress folder.  The . command then indicates the destination, the directory you are in.\nThis command will move all files within the wordpress folder (which exists in the directory you are currently in) into the directory you are currently in, and will keep the structure of the files and directories through the move (so instead of wordpress/wp-admin it'll be in just wp-admin without the wordpress folder name prepended.)\nIf you want to know what the path is to the directory you are currently in before you run the command, just type pwd on the command line, and it'll tell you what the directory path you are currently in is.

I hard-restarted, and now when I start up, I get a prompt, \"System program problem detected\" before the desktop even starts up, and the computer is barely responsive.\nWhat to do?\n\nA: If you hard-restarted, you've likely caused your OS to go into a completely unstable setup.  The easiest fix for this would be to do a clean install from a boot disk or thumb drive.  Even better, if you have access to another computer and can burn a 13.10 image, then do a clean install with the version you're trying to update.  Hopefully you had everything backed up before you started the upgrade.\n", "Q: kern.log is empty I've been noticing that my computer has been taking alot of time to shutdown. \nI decided I would look in some log files and see if I could find the culprit.

I tried to open some .exe files with wine, like Minecraft team extreme. It ran, but it was lagging too much! How do I run an .exe file without Windows/DOS/Wine?\n\nA: .exe will not work on Ubuntu if you do not have Wine installed, there is no way around this as you are trying to install a Windows program into a Linux operating system.\nI refer you to this site for further information.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine\n\nA: Linux does not understand .exe files this is a Microsoft format so It's not possible without some additional compatibility layer.\nOptions for this are Wine, PlayOnLinux neither of which is perfect.\nThe other option is to run Windows which you can either do by dual booting or installing visualisation software such as Virtualbox or VMware but these need a Windows licence and valid install media.  \n\nA: Windows and Linux are built on very different backends, and run very different types of programs. \nWhile there are equivalencies like .so objects and .dll files, .exe files are not the same as a shell file.\nYou could, under very controlled conditions with a highly customized OS named Windows with a Linux theme, run a .exe file. You will not be able to run Linux executables, however, without installing a compatibility layer like WSL and/or Cygwin. Note, though, that you'll still need an X server and a whole bunch of other things to make everything work right.\nThere are ways to run exe files on plain Linux, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a Bash shell script named test. Rename it to test.exe. You are running an EXE!!\n\n*Install Wine. As you mentioned, this is pretty laggy. You might be able to get around that by not playing games. You could try to tweak it for performance by changing the Wine settings, but you can only tweak it so much.\n\n*Install PlayOnLinux. It is a specially designed version of Wine that reduces lag in a few ways. First off, each program has it's own instance of Wine. This  slightly speeds up the PC. Also, PlayOnLinux will automatically optimize Wine (including choosing the right version!!) to make your game as good as possible.\n\n*Run a VM. You can use VirtualBox (free) to run a licensed and registered copy of Windows. This can cause all sorts of problems though, as it'll be slower than Wine.\n\n*Just Dual-Boot.  This will give you the most performance, but you still need a licensed copy of Windows. It also requires you to reboot into Windows.\n\n\nThere are no real good ways to run Windows programs in Linux, but it is possible.\n", "Q: How to know the login and password details, my name and computers name after i'm done installing ubuntu? During the setup I'm asked to type in my name and the computers name.\nAfter the OS is installed, how can I know those?\n\nA: Username\n\nYour username is usually your first name when you enter your first name and surname into the designated box during the installation process. The username is always in small caps, but at the graphical login screen your full name is shown in the default installation and you just need to remember your password. Alternatively you could also boot live media, mount the file system and look in the directory home of your installation to see which accounts exist. Digging deeper you can find all user and system accounts in /etc/passwd.\nUser password\nYou have to remember the password before you continue, or you would normally not be able to login. But you can reset your password. \nComputername\n\nYou don't need to remember your computer name or hostname, as this is shown to you at graphical and terminal login. Unless you don't customize this, the device name of your computer or motherboard is picked and probably stripped of some numbers to look nicer and your username is added. So your computer could be named Thinkpad-$Yourname, ProBook-$Yourname, Zenbook-$Yourname if that's what you have. The hostname is defined in /etc/hostname.\n\n", "Q: USB flash drives being mounted read-only in 13.10 Ever since installing 13.10 (x64) every time I insert a USB flash drive, it mounts as read-only.\nI tried using three different drives, and they all get mounted read-only.

I've not had the problem with using flash drives, but I've sure had it with partitions. Sorry if it isn't relevant. \n\nA: It is likely that the USB drive is being mounted as ready only because of permission restrictions. One workaround to this is to run the file manager as root. To do so, open a terminal and, if you are using Ubuntu's native file manager (Nautilus), issue the command:\nsudo nautilus\n\nYou will be required to type the root password to make the command work.\nThis may allow you to write the USB, despite any permissions restrictions.\n", "Q: Error: tcl.h not found (no such file or directory) I'm trying to install something using the 'make' command, however it gives me the fatal error:tcl.h no such file or directory. I'm new to linux, can anyone help me?\n\nA: Once you have a Tcl dev package installed, you'll then possibly come across the code expecting tcl.h to be in /usr/include/, but in order to facilitate multiple versions of Tcl being installed, Ubuntu places tcl.h in /usr/include/tcl/ - note the extra directory level.\nReplacing: #include <tcl.h> with #include <tcl/tcl.h> in the source code  you're trying to build should get around this.\n\nA: This means you're missing the tcl development files.  The easiest way to check is to go to: http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and put \"tcl.h\" in the \"search contents of packages\" field.  If you do this you'll find that tcl.h can be found in a number of packages you'll want to install one of those:\nsudo apt-get install tcl8.6-dev\n\n", "Q: Broadcom wifi nightmare! First of all...

The graphics controller is a GeForce 9500 GS.\nI'm running a fully updated Ubuntu 13.04 with nouveau 1:1.0.7-0ubuntu1.\nThe problem is that the second monitor (Dell) never seems to come out of standby during boot: the screen stays black and the status led on the monitor stays orange (it's green when it's on).

Here is what my drives look like:\n\nsda2 is a windows drive and sda6 is ubuntu.\nNot necessarily using gparted, what is the best way to extend sda2 so that is had the unallocated space added to it?\n\nA: Easy.  You will need to slide sda6 over into the unallocated space(which puts the free space between sda2 and sda6), then increase the size of sda2.   It is simple to do GParted:  right-click sda6 and choose Resize/Mov.  Increase the \"space preceding\" value and decrease the \"space following\" value.  It's easier just to slide the right side black arrow and the left side black arrow to the right.  This moves sda6 to the right.  Then do the same for sda2, but instead of moving the whole partition, you will just move the right-side black arrow to increase its size.\nOne gotcha, you can only move/resize unmounted partitions and sda2 will be mounted since you will be running GParted from Ubuntu.  So take the disc from which you installed Ubuntu and boot to \"Live CD\" mode.  It has GParted already installed and you can then move any and all partitions of your hdd.  \nEnjoy!\n", "Q: Tons of problems a new user is encountering I've borrowed this laptop from a friend.

There were some bugs that xbmctalk forced onto the program and I wanted to get rid of xbmctalk's addons for good.

Here is the code: \n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nchar* flip_string(char *string){\n  int i = strlen(string);\n  int j = 0;\n  // Doesn't really matter all I wanted was the same size string for temp.\n  char* temp = string; \n  puts(\"This is the original string\");\n  puts(string);\n  puts(\"This is the \\\"temp\\\" string\");\n  puts(temp);\n\n  for(i; i>=0; i--){\n    temp[j] = string[i]\n    if (j <= strlen(string)) {\n      j++;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return(temp);\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]){\n  puts(flip_string(argv[1]));\n  printf(\"This is the end of the program\\n\");\n}\n\nThat's basically it, the program compiles and everything but does not return the temp string in the end (just blank space). In the beginning it prints temp fine when it's equal to string. Furthermore if I do a character by character printf of temp in the for loop, the correct temp string in printed i.e. string -> reversed. just when I try to print it to standard out (after the for loop/ or in the main) nothing happens - only blank space is printed.\n\nA: I see two problems in your code, first you just define a pointer to your already existing string. So while you write the temp string you overwrite the input string. So create a new string.\nThe second problem is that the string ends with a 0 to signal the end of the string. So if you write the last character at the beginning of the new string it will end at the very first character. So your reverted string will not be seen.\nThe following changes to your function worked for me:\nchar* flip_string(char *string){\n  int i = strlen(string);\n  int j = 0;\n  // Doesn't really matter all I wanted was the same size string for temp.\n  char* temp = malloc(strlen(string)); \n  puts(\"This is the original string\");\n  puts(string);\n  puts(\"This is the \\\"temp\\\" string\");\n  puts(temp);\n    i--;\n  for(i; i>=0; i--){\n    temp[j] = string[i];\n    if (j <= strlen(string)) {\n      j++;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return(temp);\n}\n\n", "Q: What credentials should I use to access a Windows share? Hi,\nI have installed Samba and CIFS and all that, followed a bunch of tutorials, but still I can't access a share in the separate Windows 7 machine. Before I could access a share in Ubuntu from Windows, but although now I can't for whatever reason; the error of the attempt to mount the Windows share is the same: 13, asking for credentials (the computer with Windows is off now, but I can add the exact error message later).\nIn /etc/fstab I have:\n# ... (help info) ...\n# <file system>                            <mount point>      <type>     <options>                                  <dump> <pass>\n# ... (mounting points that don't matter for the question) ...\n//192.168.1.2/C\\:/Users/Public/Documents   /srv/Z\\:/          cifs       user=guest,password=,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8   0      0\n\nI also tried options such as username=guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8 and guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8, which, of course, don't work. What user am I supposed to use? (user=user; username=user; my credentials in the Windows and Ubuntu machines do not work, at least with the syntax I tried - similar to this).\nEven if this worked it's not actually what I want. I wanted to setup an authentication for any one trying to access the drive (it's currently 777, for the Linux share as well) and put a limit/quota on the share's use (as I see Z:on Windows, it allows for the entire C:drive to be filled).\nThank you in advance. I'd be glad if you suggested a way to do this even without the last paragraph.\n\nA: The mount.cifs man page is pretty handy here. Under the Options section:\n\n\n*\n\n*user=arg specifies the username to connect as. If this is not given, then the environment variable USER is used. This option can also take the form \"user%password\" or \"workgroup/user\" or \"workgroup/user%password\" to allow the password and workgroup to be specified as part of the username.\n\n\n*password=arg specifies the CIFS password. If this option is not given then the environment variable PASSWD is used. If the password is not specified directly or indirectly via an argument to mount, mount.cifs will prompt for a password, unless the guest option is specified.\nNote that a password which contains the delimiter character (i.e. a comma ',') will fail to be parsed correctly on the command line. However, the same password defined in the PASSWD environment variable or via a credentials file (see below) or entered at the password prompt will be read correctly.\n\nIn short, the credentials Windows (or the Samba server if we're not talking about Windows) is expecting, not your local Ubuntu credentials.\n\nOn a sidebar, your paths in your fstab string look completely whack. I would suggest:\n//192.168.1.2/share_name   /srv/z/\nIf you don't know what the share name is, use smbclient:\nsmbclient -I 192.168.1.2 -Uusername\n\nAnd that should list the resources. It also lets you test which username you should be using.\nAnd /srv/z/ needs to exist before you can mount something on it. If it doesn't exist, create it.\n", "Q: how to set up ubuntu in an empty partition i created on my laptop hd I took 50 gigs of space and partitioned it off in windows.

I selected ubuntu and got 'No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key.

Three possible solutions spring immediately to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install my rEFInd in place of rEFIt, along with an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your Linux kernel. This will enable you to boot Linux more directly (via an option whose name includes the string vmlinuz), bypassing GRUB and obviating the need for a hybrid MBR.\n\n*Repair your hybrid MBR. My gdisk program (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu, IIRC) offers the most flexible options for doing this, but the gptsync program that comes with both rEFIt and rEFInd is easier to use. (Note that rEFInd's gptsync is an updated version that will probably produce a slightly different hybrid MBR than what rEFIt's gptsync produces.)\n\n*Re-install GRUB. You can do this manually or by using the Boot Repair program using an Ubuntu live CD. It's probably best to do this after generating a new hybrid MBR, unless you're certain that your hybrid MBR is still valid.\n\n", "Q: HP 1020 won't print, Ubuntu 12.04 My HP 1020 printer doesn't print.

If your boot device has a GPT partition table, then most likely you'll need to use (hd0,gpt1) (GPT in general is trickier to set up).\nOption B uses the drive's unique UUID, which can be seen on Linux with sudo blkid or on OSX with e.g. diskutil info disk0s1 (or Disk Utility > Info).\nThe final entry might look for example like this:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 installer\" --class windows --class os {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    insmod ntldr\n    search --no-floppy --set=root --fs-uuid 0E239BC6-F960-3107-89CF-1C97F78BB46B\n    ntldr /bootmgr\n}\n\n\nA: Yeah, you'd think something like this would work:\n\nmenuentry \"Boot Windoze\" {\n  search -f \"--set-root /Winblows.iso\"\n  drivemap \"/Winblows.iso\" '(hd32)'\n  drivemap '--hook' ''\n  set root='(hd32)'\n  chainloader +1\n}\n\n\nBut Windows will just balk at that.\nIf you happen to have at least 4GB RAM, you can opt to load the whole DVD iso in memdisk and boot off that. To do that, download SysLinux and extract the memdisk file into your boot directory. Then you need to add code to Grub2 something like this\n\nmenuentry \"Boot Windoze\" {\n  search -f \"--set-root /Winblows.iso\"\n  insmod memdisk\n  linux16 /boot/memdisk iso\n  initrd16 /Winblows.iso\n}\n\n\nHowever, I'm not going to even test the code, as putting 3+ GB of data into RAM is just plain wrong (from an idealogical standpoint). No, I really wanted what you want, but in the end I put the Windows install on a partition on a USB using the Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool and chainloaded to that. Sorry there doesn't seem to be any other way that I can see.\n\nA: Technically installing from windows's .iso file can't be possible. You can boot from the .iso using grub but after that Windows will loss contact with the mounted location or it is not capable of it. So both grub & Windows should aware of mount and boot. Currently Windows doesn't support.  \nSo you need to extract/copy the content of .iso to root of a partition and then chain-load into it using grub.\n", "Q: LXC PID namespace I've been playing around a tad with LXC recently and one of the things I couldn't figure out is how are LXCs in Ubuntu implementing namespacing - in particular PID namespacing.\nI can't seem to find any reference to PID namespacing in /proc.

I thought that using any Ext3/4 reader I can extract the data on my logical partition but all the tools I used only view the Extended partition with un-located space!! as there is no logical partition at all. I have tried to boot to Ubuntu using the live CD but it didn't mount the partition and even when I used the default partitiion management tool it showed the same result of extended partition with un-located space. \nPlease help me to recover the data in the extended partition.\n\nA: If Windows has taken over the space used by that partition, your only hope is to use something like PhotoRec, which can recover individual files. You should recover the files to a different physical disk to avoid the (significant) possibility of trashing one file while you recover another one. Note that PhotoRec is unlikely to recover your filenames, so you'll need to spend a lot of time sorting through the files and renaming them.\nIf Windows has left your extended partition's space alone, you might be able to recover it using TestDisk. This program will search for \"lost\" partitions and recover them whole, so you'll then be able to mount the partition and copy files off it normally. Obviously, this is a much better solution than PhotoRec, so you should try it first if GParted or other partitioning software shows the space previously occupied by Linux to be unoccupied.\n", "Q: having trouble with ubuntu installing on galaxy s3 d2vzw Where/what would be the best way to go about doing this?

For instance Bluetooth, Displays, Online accounts, power ... I'm using Cinnamon.\nHow can I remove the duplicated items?\n\nA: I'm not sure because I don't use Cinnamon, but it's possibly the consequence of having two desktop environments available. Both of them have their .desktop files in /usr/share/applications. You could try modifying the ones you don't want to see.\nLet's say you have two of \"Bluetooth\". My .desktop file for \"Bluetooth\" looks like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Bluetooth Manager\nComment=Blueman Bluetooth Manager\nIcon=blueman\nExec=blueman-manager\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GTK;GNOME;Settings;HardwareSettings;\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=blueman\n\n(I remove extraneous languages.)\nNow, if I don't want to see this particular \"Bluetooth\" while in Cinnamon and assuming the other DE is Unity, I'd edit the file for the entry I don't want to see while in Cinnamon to look like so:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Bluetooth Manager\nComment=Blueman Bluetooth Manager\nIcon=blueman\nExec=blueman-manager\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GTK;GNOME;Settings;HardwareSettings;\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=blueman\n\nNotice the second-last line which I've added. That ensures that this particular \"Bluetooth\" will be seen only when you log into a Unity session. \nObviously, you'd take the usual precaution of backing up important files and you know how to sudo edit files. And logging out and logging back in would complete the process.\nYou can read more about .desktop files here and here.\n", "Q: Why am I having so many problems installing Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Vista? I am trying to setup my laptop to dual boot Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows Vista. I get as far as the drive table and it either freezes up or I get an error saying \"unable to satisfy partition parameters\" or something very similar. Now I just have a black screen with alternating indications that a request for cache data failed and something to do with a \"write through\". Any ideas on what I might be doing wrong?\n\nA: The \"unable to satisfy partition parameters\" message usually indicates a mismatch in the partition alignment policy between the current partitioning program (Ubuntu's installer in this case) and whatever created existing partitions on the disk. To elaborate, in the past partition start and end points were aligned on \"cylinder\" boundaries. Disk cylinders are real, but the \"cylinder\" boundaries used for partitioning have been convenient fictions since the 1990s. More recently they've become INconvenient fictions, and now they're downright detrimental, which is why new software aligns partitions on 1MiB boundaries.\nThe problem is that there seems to be a rounding problem in libparted, such that when you tell it to create a new partition with no space between the preceding or following partition, it tends to try to adjust the alignment, which can create an overlap in the partitions. The solution is to create your partitions manually, but leave a short (1MiB should be enough) gap between the partitions you create and any that already exist. Unfortunately, this means you'll need to use the \"Something Else\" installation option rather than auto-partitioning.\nThat said, your other errors sound like they may be symptoms of hardware problems. Certainly problems that can't be repeated are often symptoms of hardware failures. Posting the complete and exact error messages is necessary for further diagnosis, though. If necessary, take a photo with a digital camera and post it (or a link to it) here. Be sure the text is legible, though.\n", "Q: Linux Kernel 3.10.17 upgrade in 12.04 64bit?

I've used Ubuntu for almost a year and I don't like the Unity environment and I installed BackTrack R3 in my laptop which uses GNOME 2.32 and I'm much impressed with that and made a decision to move to GNOME but, it is currently in version 3.x and it has been said that there is no GNOME 2.x versions are supported.\nI don't like the new GNOME and surfed the internet for finding a distro with that version and support. But, I can't find one. Can you specify a good distro with GNOME 2.x and Debian package installers?\n\nA: well you can install Point Linux , it also uses Gnome 2.x only. I have read the Doc at it official site : http://pointlinux.org/\nits also Debian based Linux.\nScreen shots:They are different languages.\n\n\n\n**@OP As I have seen ** \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop supports ,May 9 2013 ( Reached EOL already)\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server supports, April 2015 ( We have two more years) \n\n\nSo you can install Ubuntu 10.04 LTS server edition (http://releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/ for download links) and then \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nwill install gnome 2.X in your Ubuntu and you can enjoy it for two more years.\n\nA: See this post.\nIt shows you how to install MATE, a fork of Gnome 2. The links are in the post by Lingeek.\n\nA: I would install any version of Ubuntu you like 12.04/13.10 and install Ubuntu fallback. Also known as the classic desktop. It's similar to MATE and Point Linux but has a more modern look. Instructions on how to install it is available here. \n", "Q: How do I read a variable from a file? I want to insert in my script a value (string) that I would read from a text file.\nFor example, instead of:\necho \"Enter your name\"\nread name\n\nI want to read a string from another text file so the interpreter should read the string from the file and not the user input.\n\nA: Considering that you want all the content of your text file to be kept in your variable, you can use: \n#!/bin/bash\n\nfile=\"/path/to/filename\" #the file where you keep your string name\n\nname=$(cat \"$file\")        #the output of 'cat $file' is assigned to the $name variable\n\necho $name               #test\n\nOr, in pure bash:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfile=\"/path/to/filename\"     #the file where you keep your string name\n\nread -d $'\\x04' name < \"$file\" #the content of $file is redirected to stdin from where it is read out into the $name variable\n\necho $name                   #test\n\n\nA: One alternative way to do this would be to just redirect standard input to your file, where you have all the user input in the order it's expected by the program. For example, with the program (called script.sh)\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Enter your name:\"\nread name\necho \"...and now your age:\"\nread age\n\n# example of how to use the values now stored in variables $name and $age\necho \"Hello $name. You're $age years old, right?\"\n\nand the input file (called input.in)\nTomas\n26\n\nyou could run this from the terminal in one of the following two ways:\n$ cat input.in | ./script.sh\n$ ./script.sh < input.in\n\nand it would be equivalent to just running the script and entering the data manually - it would print the line \"Hello Tomas. You're 26 years old, right?\".\nAs Radu Rădeanu has already suggested, you could use cat inside your script to read the contents of a file into a avariable - in that case, you need each file to contain only one line, with only the value you want for that specific variable. In the above example, you'd split the input file into one with the name (say, name.in) and one with the age (say, age.in), and change the read name and read age lines to name=$(cat name.in)  and age=$(cat age.in) respectively.\n\nA: Short answer:\nname=`cat \"$file\"`\n\n\nA: I found working solution here:\nhttps://af-design.com/2009/07/07/loading-data-into-bash-variables/\nif [ -f $SETTINGS_FILE ];then\n    . $SETTINGS_FILE\nfi\n\n\nA: From within your script you can do this:\nread name < file_containing _the_answer\n\nYou can even do this multiple times e.g. in a loop\nwhile read LINE; do echo \"$LINE\"; done < file_containing_multiple_lines\n\n\nA: name=$(<\"$file\") \n\nFrom man bash:1785, this command substitution is equivalent to name=$(cat \"$file\") but faster.\n\nA: To read variables from a file we can use the source or . command.\nLets assume the file contains the following line\nMYVARIABLE=\"Any string\"\n\nwe can then import this variable using\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource <filename>\necho $MYVARIABLE\n\n\nA: If you want to use multiple strings, you could go with:\npath=\"/foo/bar\";\nfor p in `cat \"$path\"`;\ndo echo \"$p\" ....... (here you would pipe it where you need it) \n\nOR\nIf you want the user to indicate the file\nread -e \"Specify path to variable(s): \" path;\nfor p in 'cat \"$path\"';\ndo echo \"$p\" ............................\n\n\nA: #! /bin/bash\n#  (GPL3+) Alberto Salvia Novella (es20490446e)\n\n\nvariableInFile () {\n    variable=${1}\n    file=${2}\n\n    source ${file}\n    eval value=\\$\\{${variable}\\}\n    echo ${value}\n}\n\n\nvariableInFile ${@}\n\n\nA: I use this to get a single variable from a file\nGET_VAR=$(grep --color=never -Po \"^${GET_VAR}=\\K.*\" \"${FILE}\" || true)\n\nWhen GET_VAR is not found in ${FILE} it will be blank rather than causing an error thanks to the || true.\nIt uses grep -P which is in GNU grep but not default in all grep at the time of writing this.\n\nA: This question is a bit vague, hence a lot of the bizarre responses; in fact, some of the answers on this page do not even address the original question whatsoever.\nThat said, if you want to source (read) a bash variable from a different file, the best solution is always to use a subshell so that no conflicts arise between your script and the file that is being read:\nWORKING_VARIABLE=$(source /path/script.sh; echo $FILE_VARIABLE)\n\nWe use this method in SlickStack for sourcing the config file multiple times without conflicts.\nIf you plan to use multiple variables from the file or have other reasons to include the entirety of the other file in your current script, then you might source the entire file:\nsource /path/script.sh\n\nBut in non-bash-variable cases, such as the OP situation of wanting to read a simple \"string\" from a text file, neither of these solutions would work, and you'd have to use a solution that is tailored to the syntax of the code you are trying to read... for example, one of the examples on this page using grep or awk combinations, or @thom solution for reading a given line of a file using read.\nTL;DR subshells are best for bash variables, otherwise it depends on the syntax of the file.... if you want to save the file contents as a bash variable, try cat as explained by @hellork.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Ubuntu 12.04 - How do I change boot I installed Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Ubuntu 12.04\nThe system still boots up 12.04\nHow do I boot up 13.10?\n\nA: I think you have the timeout period as = 0. so GRUB not waiting for your choice.

You can also try just navigating a simple PPA repository with your web browser to see how it looks in practice. (Example link: pypy ppa).\nIf you're planning on updating it only rarely, it is possible to set up the necessary directories and index files by hand, but probably not recommended. A tool like debarchiver should help you (although I have not used it personally).\nYou then just add a new file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d corresponding to your new repository.

Is there a heartbeat package for Ubuntu as well, and if so, how can I install it?\n\nA: Installing heartbeat can be done easily with Apt:\nsudo apt-get install heartbeat\n\nThrough configuring your cluster is highly dependant on what you're are trying to accomplish. By default on Ubuntu, the main configuration file /etc/ha.d/ha.cf does not exist and the service will not be started. You must create it yourself. It should identify the nodes in your cluster. For example:\nnode primary\nucast eth0 1.1.1.1\nnode secondary\nucast eth0 1.1.1.2\n\nMore information on the ha.cf file can be found here.\nYou'll also need to configure /etc/ha.d/haresources with a list of services and the default node to run them on. It can be as simple as:\nprimary my-service\n\nHere, primary is the name of the default node and my-service corresponds to an init script at /etc/init.d/my-service More information about the haresources file can be found here.\nThe file /etc/ha.d/authkeys also needs to be created with an auth toke which will be shared on both nodes, like:\nauth1\n1 sha1 d1e6557e2fcb30ff8d4d3ae65b50345fa46a2faa\n\nMore information on the authkeys can be found here.\n\nA: As I have seen that a very big part of the configuration and installation and may be not possible for mentioning here but you can access them from \nhttp://blog.bobbyallen.me/2013/01/21/installing-a-high-availability-web-server-cluster-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts-using-haproxy-heartbeat-and-nginx/\nhttp://blog.romerojunior.com/linux/linux-building-basic-high-availability-infrastructure-for-web-servers/\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu by usb I had a problem with installing Ubuntu's  latest version on my Windows.

An example below.\nsudo dd if=/home/username/Downloads/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=16M\n\nIn the above command, if accepts the location of the .iso file (input) and of accepts the USB you've connected (output).

Sometimes it crash when I just type something - what is the problem? What other Ubuntu program would you recommend instead 12.04?\n\nA: That sounds like a hardware fault, there are a few things to think about:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you just leave it running with no windows open does it work reliably?  \n\n*Does it fail immediately when you open the second window/program?  \n\n*Have you tried different combinations of software to check that it is not a single faulty program?\n\n\nThe easiest thing to check is a memory fault, which could cause these symptoms.  Reboot and at the grub prompt select the 'memtest' option, leave it to run for a couple of hours at least and see if it reports any problems.\nEven if it doesn't, it might be worth carefully removing and reseating your memory cards.\nIf that is all clear, tell us more about the machine, how old it is, has it been used successfully with other operating systems etc, it doesn't sound like an Ubuntu 12.04 specific problem at this stage.\n", "Q: HP 530 on Ubuntu 12.04 - no WiFi I have a HP 530 laptop with Ubuntu 12.04 installed.

I installed the b43 kernel driver, which made wlan0 appear, but rfkill always showed the device to be hard blocked. \nThe wifi button didn't do anything, so I installed Windows 7, and the problem remained until I installed the HP Wireless Assistant utility from the HP site. This has an \"enable\" button after which the wifi button started working.\n\n\n*\n\n*So I believe the HP 530 wifi button somehow needs software activation which is just not present in Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and I did rfkill\n(rfkill unblock 0)\nit didn't do anything but I then disabled networking, re-enabled networking.\nAnd I then pressed the hardware button on the device.\ndisabled and re-enabled networking again,\nIt seemed to work\nsince then this method works on every update (even 14.04\nhope this helped!!\n\nA: Uninstall the bcmwl-kernel-source package (if it is installed) by issuing the following command: \nsudo apt-get remove bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nMake sure that firmware-b43-installer and b43-fwcutter packages are installed (of course, you need to connect to the internet somehow for this or download it on some other computer and install it that way): \nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer b43-fwcutter \n\nThen, execute: \ncat /etc/modprobe.d/* | egrep 'bcm'\n\nIf you see blacklist bcm43xx in the output, this approach may work for you. \nEdit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf by putting # in front of the line: blacklist bcm43xx.\nYou may open the file for editing with e.g.:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAfter reboot, your wireless should work. \n", "Q: Commands don't have permission when using absolute path I have folders set up this way:\n/srv/samba/video\ngetfacl /srv/samba/video\n\n# file: srv/samba/video\n# owner: root\n# group: nogroup\nuser::rwx\ngroup::---\ngroup:sambaclients:rwx\ngroup:deluge:rwx\nmask::rwx\nother::---\ndefault:user::rwx\ndefault:group::---\ndefault:group:sambaclients:rwx\ndefault:group:deluge:rwx\ndefault:mask::rwx\ndefault:other::---\n\nThat means, user deluge has rwx to folder /srv/samba/video.\nHowever, when running command as user deluge, I am getting weird permission errors.\nWhen in folder /srv/samba/video:\nsudo -u deluge mkdir foo\n\nworks flawlessly.\nBut when using absolute path:\nsudo -u deluge mkdir /srv/samba/video/foo\n\nI am getting permission denied.\nWhen running sudo -u deluge id, I get output\nuid=113(deluge) gid=124(deluge) skupiny=124(deluge)\n\nwhich shows that user deluge is indeed in group deluge. Also, the behavior was the same when I gave the permissions also to user deluge not just group deluge. When executing as non-system user, it does work.\nThe reason that I want to use absolute paths is that I am using automatically triggered post-download script which extracts some files into the folder.\nI have spent way too many hours to solve this problem myself.\nmkdir isn't the only command that fails, touch is doing the same thing, so I suspect that it's not mkdir's fault.\nIf you need more info, I will try to put it in here, just ask.\nThanx in advance.\nEdit:\nIt seems that the root of the problem is acl set on perent folder /srv/samba, which indeed does not grant permissions to deluge (but neither denies it).\ngetfacl /srv/samba\n# file: srv/samba\n# owner: root\n# group: nogroup\nuser::rwx\ngroup::---\ngroup:sambaclients:rwx\nmask::rwx\nother::---\ndefault:user::rwx\ndefault:group::---\ndefault:group:sambaclients:rwx\ndefault:mask::rwx\ndefault:other::---\n\nIf I grant the permission also to this folder, it suddenly starts to work so I believe that the acl on /srv/samba is somehow denying the permissions to deluge.\nSo the question is: how do I set acl to both /srv/samba and /srv/samba/video so that sambaclients have access to whole /srv/samba and subdirectories and deluge has access only to /srv/samba/video and subdirectories?\n\nA: User deluge must be able to see contents of the parent directory /srv/samba. Thus applying executable bit to it: chmod o+x /srv/samba resolved the issue.\nThe reason why it worked with relative path is that when sudoing the command, we already were in directory /srv/samba/video and thus no permission checks were applied.\n", "Q: After upgrading to 13.10, no applications are visible in the application lens I upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10 and now all icons in the application lens are gone.\n\nThis is what I tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install --reinstall unity-lens-applications\n\n*unity --replace and unity --reset-icons\n\n*moving ~/.config to ~/.config2\n\n*deleting ~/.cache/software-center and ~/.cache/unity\nMost of these things have been suggested in this question: Unity Applications lens is empty - but all to no avail.\n\nA: I think this is likely because the unity-scope-home package is not installed.\nTry using Software Center to find and install that package, log out and back in to restart Unity, and see if that resolves the problem.\n\nA: I think I may have had a similar problem, not sure it was due to upgrading to 13.10 or due to user error. I ended up fixing it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out of unity and log in to tty1 (ctrl-alt-f1).\n\n*\"sudo apt-get purge unity\" (gets rid of unity and it's settings).\n\n*\"sudo apt-get autoremove\" (gets rid of any leftover packages that unity depended on, like the lenses and such.)\n\n*\"sudo reboot\" and log into tty1 again afterwards.\n\n*\"sudo apt-get install unity\" \n\n\nBit drastic, but it worked.\n", "Q: Cannot install Oracle 11R2 on Ubuntu 13.10 because package \"gcc-c++-3.4.6\" is missing during prerequisite checks I am not able to install Oracle 11R2 on my Ubuntu 13.10 because package \"gcc-c++-3.4.6\" is missing.\nI tried How can I install Oracle 11g R2? and this, but I still get this error:\n\nThis is a prerequisite condition to test whether the package \"gcc-c++-3.4.6\" is available on the system.

Can somebody shed some light on this statement?\nP.S. I don't know if these questions have been asked yet, I searched for these (maybe I didn't search hard enough), but I didn't find any.\n\nA: Welcome to the community Kiran.\nYou can use Ubuntu without installing it, just follow the try before installing instructions.\nIf a driver is missing from default Ubuntu, the OS will install it. This is known as proprietary drivers. To list the drivers use the lshw command in Terminal.\nWhen you install Ubuntu on a hard drive which is already occupied by Windows or Mac, be careful while choosing where to install, as I lost data while doing that.\nIt could be helpful if you use VMWARE or Oracle box to run Ubuntu virtually.\nIf any help is needed, the community is always there to help!\n\nA: Yes you can install and use it without any knowledge.\nThe alluring aspect of Linux is its philosophy : In Linux you walk in a free world. There's no need to cracking, no need to a serial number, no need to prove that you've already bought a software and own it because you already own every softwares under Linux.\nThere are some absolutely basic command that you can do your elementary actions well with them.\ncommands like sudo apt-get, sudo apt-add-repository for downloading needing packages so easily, are an example.\nAnd of course there are plenty of helpful sites (like this site) with friendly users in order to help you go through Ubuntu.\nSo don't hesitate and start exploring this safe and free OS. \n\nA: My mom, who's not even remotely tech-oriented, prefers Ubuntu to Windows. She runs Firefox and LibreOffice and that's pretty much it, but she likes it better than Windows.\n\nA: Fear not, ;) - you can use Ubuntu without need of too much knowledge. You are on the safe side with that. But later you will feel that some knowledge cannot harm, and it is more fun, to use Linux with more tricks and else.\nIn this sense - here a link for you for free books - which cannot harm. It is not a must, but you can save it for later - in case you need to help yourself.:\nhttp://itsfoss.com/5-free-ubuntu-books-for-beginners/\n\nA: It can be a great learning experience - you can go into it as deeply as you want.\nIf you just want to use Ubuntu for web browsing, writing emails and documents, or any other usual thing, then it is as easy to use as windows.\nBut if you want to you can discover all sorts of things that are simply not available in windows - including the source code that runs the operating system. There are all sorts of high quality programs included for free, that you would have to pay for under windows.\nIt's not some massive technical problem that only graduates and geeks can handle, so don't worry! A couple of hours and you will feel at ease with most of it.\nAlso there is a huge amount of help online and a large number of people who are happy to help new users make the shift to Linux.\n\nA: Yes you can. use Ubuntu forums, preferably on a second machine, and eventually you will find all the answers. I personally did just this a month ago, and after crashing my systems a few times, frozen screens and seemingly impossible solutions, I found all the answers amongst the Ubuntu community. It is so refreshing not to have to pay for simple solutions, and I highly recommend that you go ahead and switch from Windows to a system that you can control yourself and does not treat you like an income source, when wanting to know more. You will also learn so much more that by only using windows, and hopefully help to promote open source software. Enjoy\n\nA: You can certainly use Ubuntu without knowing anything about Linux. However, once you get into it, you're likely to want to learn more. It's like switching from an old mule that doesn't care much what you want to a vehicle that can be a pickup truck or an Indy racer or a jet ski as you see fit. \nLittle by little, you'll learn to do what interests you most.\n\nA: Yes, you can use Ubuntu and I am sure that you will enjoy it. I don't have any basic knowledge about Linux too, but recently I use Ubuntu.\nIf you currently use Microsoft Windows I suggest to use windows installer. It's unbelievably easy to install Ubuntu besides your Windows.

I have to kill and start again - which often defeats the purpose of my VNC session.\nPlease help!\nRegards,\nJP\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, there are scanning bots for popular vnc ports.\n\n*There is solution without killing vncserver: Connect by SSH, and type in command to change VNC password vncpasswd After changing password, authentication failures will reset and you'll be able to login again. In this case your VNC desktop will remain launched without interrupting.\n\n\nA: \"VNC conenction failed: vncserver too many security failures\"\nMeans that someone tried to log in with incorrect credentials too frequently within a specified period of time. What that number and time is vary depending on what VNC Server you're using.\nSomeone's probably running a script trying to log into anything it can find listening on the standard VNC ports, and you'll need to find out what ip this is coming from and block it.\n", "Q: Keyboard layout changing from UK to US, not showing as changed in settings My password contains a # symbol in it, and recently I've found that if I lock my screen and come back I won't be able to log in, forcing me to shut down the computer and try again. After one of these reboots and successfully logging in, I then tried installing something in terminal, which required me to enter my password. When I tried to install it though, I kept getting told that my password was wrong. Just out of curiosity I tried writing my password where I could see it, and sure enough instead of a #, there was a \\ instead.\nOn an UK keyboard the button above the right Shift, next to the Enter key button, is #, and Shift+3 is the £ symbol. But now it seems to have changed to an US layout, where Shift+3 is #, and the # key is \\. My password is pretty long and this bug is really getting irritating, because it makes me stop and press in each key individually, which makes it take much longer to do anything. Also I need to do quite a bit of word processing as well as HTML coding, and all sorts of keys seem to have been changed, which is obviously going to be a hindrance.\n\nA: This should permanently fix the problem in 13.10 and 14.04:\nIn the ubuntu software center, install \"dconf Editor\" (dconf-editor) (if you don't already have it).

These new entries should boot Linux. If they do, you can remove the non-functional Linux entry by editing /EFI/refind/refind.conf, uncommenting the scanfor line, and ensuring that hdbios is not among the options.\nIf you did not use the --alldrivers option, or if you don't see the vmlinuz entry/entries, you should try installing the ext4fs driver that comes with rEFInd. Assuming you used the default rEFInd installation options, you need to create the /EFI/refind/drivers directory in OS X and then copy the ext4fs driver for your architecture (X64 or IA32) to that directory. When you reboot, you should see a new Linux option, with a name that includes vmlinuz. This should boot correctly.\n\nEDIT: Could you please do the following and post the results (edit your original post to do this):\n\n\n*\n\n*In OS X, type ls -l $(find /EFI -iname \"*.efi\") and post the results here. (This assumes you installed rEFInd under OS X using the default options; if you installed it to the ESP, mount it and adjust the path from /EFI to your ESP's mount point.)\n\n*In Linux, type ls -l /boot/vmlinuz* and post the results here.\n\n*Check the refind.conf file for the presence of a line reading scan_all_linux_kernels. Be sure that it is present and that it is not commented out (by a leading # character).\n\n\nYou could also try to get BIOS-mode booting working again by fixing the hybrid MBR and/or by re-installing GRUB; however, hybrid MBRs are ugly and dangerous, so that's not the approach I recommend. If you do go down this road, try using the gptsync program from rEFInd rather than the one from rEFIt. The latter failed for you, but rEFInd's will probably work; or you can use gdisk for this job, as described on the page to which I linked earlier in this paragraph.\n\nEDIT 2: Your kernels are all 3.2.x versions, which predate the EFI stub loader. This means that they won't work directly with rEFInd. Broadly speaking, there are two ways to work around this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add another EFI boot loader, such as ELILO or the EFI version of GRUB 2, to boot your existing 3.2.x kernel(s). This is fairly easy to do if you know how, but it's an unfamiliar process to most users. See my page on the topic for background and general instructions. Note that these instructions assume you've got a working Linux installation, though; you'll probably have to use a live CD to get things installed. Also, you need not run efibootmgr to register a boot loader with the firmware; just copy its files into place and set up its configuration file. Thereafter, rEFInd should detect whatever you install and enable you to launch it.\n\n*Upgrade your kernel to something from the 3.3.x series or later. This is fairly easily done if you can boot your current system, as described here, but of course this creates a catch-22 situation. You should be able to overcome this hurdle by using chroot from an emergency disc, as described here.\nAnother option is to upgrade your version of Ubuntu. I realize that 3.04 is an LTS release, but there have been 3.04.1 and 3.04.2 releases since then, and I'm pretty sure that they include the newer kernels. I'm not sure if you could install 3.04.2 over 3.04 to get it all working, but you might look into that possibility.\n", "Q: TFTP Error code 1: File not found When I'm sending a file through TFTP remotely, it shows an error like \ntftp> put MYMIBTable.txt /home/amsys/Desktop/              \nError code 1: File not found\n\nWhat is the problem?

Is there a way to systematically sort files by metadata and then use that list with rm?\n\nA: For the sake of completeness, it's worth too mention that it's also very easy to open a directory and it's subdirectories in Puddletag, sort for your desired criteria, and then mark and delete the files you want. This might be safer and even faster than customizing or writing a completely new script (see: xkcd 1205 - Is It Worth the Time?).\n\nYou can use metaflac (manpage) for flac files.\n$ metaflac --show-sample-rate --show-bps \"somefile.flac\"\n44100\n16\n\nOf course this is not a complete script. You might want to take a look at the Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide.\nThe following would be a very basic script that deletes all files which return 44100 and 16 to the above command. The directory is given to the script as a parameter (e.g. flac-44100-removal.sh \"Music/All music with 44.1kHz/\")\n#!/bin/bash\nIFS=$'\\n'\n\nfor file in $(find \"${1}\" -name \"*.flac\");\ndo\n    if [ \"$(metaflac  --show-sample-rate \"$file\")\" = \"44100\" ]; then\n        if [ \"$(metaflac  --show-bps \"$file\")\" = \"16\" ]; then\n            rm -i \"$file\"\n        fi\n    fi\ndone\n\nAlternatives to metaflac are: vorbiscomment for ogg, AtomicParsley for mp4/m4a, mid3v2 for mp3 or mediainfo for everything, but they all have different outputs, with mediainfo being overly customizable.\n", "Q: How to install VirtualBox from command line?

Scary yet flawless process :)\nBefore doing all that - I installed rEFIt. I saw it on oh so many internet-guides, and remembered it from back in the day before I was an IT Manager & Tech... So I was sure it'll be THE thing to help me out.\nAnd indeed it was great, only I missed one very important detail:\nOn rEFIt's main webpage they clearly state: \"As you may have noticed, rEFIt is no longer actively maintained. Please check out rEFInd, a fork that is maintaned and under active development.\"\nSo now all of a sudden I notice this strange phenomenon:\nMy Ubuntu Server OS only boots up properly while I have a screen attached to the Machine(MacMini). The keyboard & mouse don't seem to be needed, but if I reboot without a screen being connected, it just gets stuck along the way and I can't access it via putty from my not-so-remote windows machine. If I then connect a screen to the MacMini, I see it got stuck along the way and there's no options to be chosen.\nCurrently, my only option seems to be rebooting with a connected screen, then unplugging it and connecting it back to my windows-pc, where I use putty for an ssh connection over the LAN.\nI decided to check rEFIt's website for troubleshooting options, when I suddenly noticed the comment about rEFInd and instantly face-palmed.\nI saw that the maintainer of rEFInd is here in the forums (am I right in my realization that it's Rod Smith?\nSo I thought after explaining the situation and how delicate it is for my work - I'd ask this supposedly simple question:\nI've read through the installation guide in the rEFInd site and I still don't understand how I can replace my current rEFIt with the new rEFInd without having to format anything, nor erase anything, nor delete, nor risk anything in my current system and/or files.\nCan you please help me?\n\nA: Yes, I'm rEFInd's maintainer.\nJust running the install.sh script from OS X should install rEFInd as the default boot loader, bypassing rEFIt, although you might also want to install an EFI filesystem driver for the filesystem on which your Linux kernel resides. (That will enable direct booting of Linux without involving GRUB.) Also, running rEFInd's install.sh script will not completely remove rEFIt. If you find that rEFInd works as well as or better than rEFIt, you can delete rEFIt manually by removing the /EFI/refit directory in OS X (or on your ESP, if you installed it there).\nThat said, it seems unlikely to me that rEFInd will fix the problem you're having. I've never heard of this issue before, but my suspicion is that it's a firmware limitation, not a bug in rEFIt. I have made some changes to video handling in rEFInd, and it's conceivable that one of those changes would inadvertently fix your problem. It's worth trying rEFInd to see if this is the case, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.\nYou might want to try completely removing rEFIt before installing rEFInd to test whether the computer will boot with the monitor unplugged without any third-party boot managers installed. If it does, then rEFIt is probably hanging or pausing and waiting for input when the monitor is disconnected. If rEFInd does the same thing, it would be difficult to debug, because there's currently no facility to write a log file that would reveal where such a hang occurs.\n", "Q: In KDE 4.11.2 saucy with both nvidia and nouveau drivers I have strange artefacts KDE 4.11.2, ubuntu 13.10, nvidia/nouveau, system/raster qt graphics system.\nWhen opening/closing a window there is a chance, that black blinking line will appear near plasma panel.

In which log files should I find my answer?\nI installed a VNC server and turned on desktop sharing, and last time I could log in - maybe that is an issue. How can I disable it without GUI?\n\nA: For me the immediately logout problem was caused by an error in ~/.profile. I am using 13.10. The (approximate) solution is found here or here. You can change or delete the file causing problems by pressing ctrl + alt + F6 and logging in that way.\n\nA: I  don't know if it would be exactly the same case, but this happened to me because somehow I corrupted the .Xautority file in my home. I think it's something related with remote access to the X server.\nLog into a tty (Control+Alt+F6) and after typing your username and password:\nsudo rm -v .Xauthority\n\nThe .Xauthority file is in /home/, which is where the terminal's default working path also usually is.

I fixed it by Alt+Ctrl+F1 then using sudo useradd <username> -m -s /bin/bash then sudo passwd <username> to give them a password. Restart and login as that new user. Give them admin. role. Copy files from old home admin user directory to new one. Optionally delete the old user. \nBit of a cludge but I have no idea what was causing the kickout at login and didn't have time to find out so this was quick and required minimal knowledge of command line. \n\nA: I had this same issue, and I could not find any solution so I decided to install gnome3 instead of unity to sort of side-step the issue.  Turns out there was an error in the initialization of dpkg service.  I ran sudo dpkg --configure -a and it worked like a charm.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and couldn't even log in using tty. I edited ~/.profile before a reboot and knew that was probably causing an error.\nTake your Live USB an boot from it. Then you can just mount your home partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nnow you can navigate to your home directory:\ncd /mnt/username/home\n\nand from there you can edit whatever file is causing a problem.\n\nA: /bin and /sbin removed from $PATH will cause this issue.

I know it may have been asked a thousand times. I have googled like crazy and I'm on the verge of desperation here.\nBasically, I followed this guide:\nhttp://motionsoundfx.com/2012/05/ubuntu-vnc-afp-macosx/\nTo create a small personal file server. When I installed it, I was able to connect to it just fine, I connected with my Ubuntu username and password and I was able to see the home directory. But later, I had to restart the file server so I could prepare a couple of other hard drives to put in.\nWhen the server restarted, I tried to connect to it, but I got an error message on my Mac:\n\"The version of the server you're trying to connect to is not supported. Please contact your system administrator to solve this problem.\"\nAgain, I have googled like crazy for this, and everybody says it is a problem with OS X Lion and up (assuming it affects Mavericks too). I have tried all the fixes mentioned for Lion and Mountain Lion and I haven't had any luck. That's the reason I'm posting this here: I suspect the problem is with my Ubuntu server. This happened after I restarted the server. Before restarting the server, I just put in my credentials and saw my home directory. Something when I restarted the server must have been messed up.\nI have found some other solutions, including to use \"SHX2\" in the conf file, but it hasn't worked for me.\nI ask for your help to solve this issue.\nAlso please understand I'm completely illiterate when it comes to Linux. This is a nice chance to me to learn the OS so please give me detailed steps to do things if you deem it necessary.

There are no wallpapers showing and the main screen is not refreshing (this is when moving a window around the desktop there are drag-lines showing all over the screen). The only way to refresh is to activate the 3D cube. In addition the mouse-over activates inactive windows and when writing a letter moves the cursor wherever the mouse pointer is). Everything is working as before, except that I can not activate a second monitor to extend the desktop.

Desktop icons appear, the Unity menu appears, all else works.\nWorkaround: Enable the compiz-fusion wallpaper feature.\n\nA: I had the same problem with screen refresh after updating a large number of apts on 12.04 (Precise).\nThe login screen was normal. After logging in, however, the login box would still be visible, with my desktop icons above it. The screen would then black out (icons still visible) and the refresh rate would be extremely slow. Window drag lines would be seen. There was no problem launching programs though.\nI fixed this by launching CompizConfig and checking and unchecking options. Part of my screen was still visible as I did this, so I could see if the option had an effect on my screen. Finally I found that unchecking the \"Wobbly Windows\" option under \"Effects\" seemed to fix the screen refresh problem.\n", "Q: Install ubuntu using GRUB2 I have Deepin linux installed and now I need to install ubuntu. I don't have CD ROM , so I thought I can use GRUB2 ISO boot option. I have used the link Install Ubuntu from iso file using grub2 to boot ISO using GRUB2. I need to install the operating system.

Even if I click install, the installer does nothing and the installation didn't start. What to do? Any ideas?\n\nA: If you don't intend to keep Deepin Linux, an easier and standard way of doing this is to create a live USB disk. As long your computer is not old (not more than a few years old), your computer should be able to boot from the USB disk. To create a live USB disk, download UNetbootin, run it and select Ubuntu as the distribution and the version, or if you have the disk image downloaded enter the path in the text field at the bottom.

To expand it, you need unallocated space after it, but inside the extended partition.  You have unallocated space after the extended partition, so you have to expand the extended partition to move the unallocated space into the extended partition, then you can expand the swap partition.\nIn order to resize a partition, it must not be mounted ( the key icon shows it is mounted ).  You will need to right click on the swap partition and choose to unmount/swapoff so you can expand it.  Since your root partition is also a logical partition though, you will not be able to unmount it, and thus, leave the extended partition unlocked so you can resize it, so you will need to do this from the livecd instead.\n\nA: You'll need to reboot into a Live environment (CD, USB, etc) so that the partitions aren't mounted when you try to resize them.\nFrom there it's just a case of loading up Gparted (it seems you're good friends already) and scaling up.\n\nA: Like @Oli Says you need that partition be unmounted to resize it. So, you can use a pendrive for some minutes to help in this situation.\nFirst follow this tutorial to create a swap partition in your pendrive. \nThen, unmount your original swap partition and resize with any tool like gparted or fdisk.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Go to this link\nHow to increase swap space?\nIn this link all the different cases of available unallocated spaces available are well explained\n", "Q: I need my pendrive to boot into Ubuntu, how to correct this and boot from the HDD? I installed Ubuntu through USB. Instillation was successful.\nBut when I restarted my laptop it didn't boot. So planed install it again when started selected install from USB. it booted my previous installed Ubuntu. So after went Ubuntu boots no need of that pen drive, so in short, every time I want to start my pc I need that pen drive to boot.\n\nA: The most likely cause was that you installed GRUB in your Pendrive. To correct this situation you have to Install GRUB correctly in the Hard Disk. First you need intel to do this, you need to know what partition is your Ubuntu. For this we rely in fdisk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using your pendrive in a live session, open the terminal, then type sudo blkid. You will get a output similar to this:\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"bf554a2f-a035-4c22-bca8-162def35a03c\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"3962db06-3776-4f38-8ab9-eab6feeccc1d\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"AA64B45A64B42AC9\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sdb2: UUID=\"F66E431C6E42D551\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sdb3: UUID=\"75a0854b-8b6b-453f-8aec-2a081a1f19e3\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sdb5: UUID=\"279a18da-130b-46dd-8b54-84da48eb445f\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sdb6: UUID=\"393cd35e-b827-4dea-acb5-2a66f2369dce\" TYPE=\"swap\"\n\n*Here you can see that my Hard Drive is in the sda and my pendrive is sdg. We are interested in sda. Now lest look at the descriptions of the partitions. We want the partitions that are ext4. In my case I have two ext4 partitions. This is because I have my /boot separated, I will take note about that, but lets assume that you don't have /boot separated for now and that your / (root) is sda1. Now we will mount sda1.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount -o bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nTecnical note: This is the minimum. If you have a /boot partition (or any other) separated just mount it the same way, in my case sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot. Please take note that I used /mnt/boot, you should change it if using other mount points.\n\n*Now we will proceed to CHROOTING the partition:\nsudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash\n\n\n*Now we will proceed to install grub:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n\n*Done.

I already had Ubuntu (previous version) installed on it, but removed it some time ago. After that, the default Windows boot menu is showing up every time I boot up computer, and the only entry is Windows 8.\nWhat I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burned Ubuntu 13.10 DVD\n\n*Restarted computer and booted from it\n\n*Chosen Install Ubuntu (not Try Ubuntu)\n\n*Created new ext4 partition from free space\n\n*Installed Ubuntu on it\n\n\nWhat happened:\nAfter the installation I restarted the computer. Windows default boot menu showed up (just as before) and the only entry was still Windows 8.\nUpdate:\nAfter running boot repair, I saw Ubuntu on boot list. I booted into Ubuntu and it worked fine, but after restart my computer was stuck at the black screen (with Vaio logo shown).\nSo I decided to run boot repair again, but now when I try to boot into Ubuntu, I see the following error:\nWindows failed to start.

I can't find the symbol in character map, and I don't really want to change keyboard layout just to type one symbol occasionally.\n\nA: If you use English (US) keyboard layout and you don't want to change it, the the fastest way would be to use Ctrl+Shift+U key combination and then type 20ac followed by Space(or Enter) which will turn into €.\n\nNow if you want, for example, to change the $ sign (which you can type it using Shift+4 shortcut when you have an US English keyboard) with € sign, you can use the following command in terminal in terminal:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  13 = 4 EuroSign 4 EuroSign\"\nFrom now you can type € using Shift+4 shortcut.\nTo switch back to $ sign, use:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  13 = 4 dollar 4 dollar\"\n\nTo get this change for every session, create a file called .xmodmap, with the following command:\nxmodmap -pke > .xmodmap\n\nThen, create a file called .xinitrc in your home directory, containing the following line/command:\nxmodmap .xmodmap\n\nIn the same mode you can set any other key combination to type € symbol. Use xmodmap -pke command to see all keycodes and their map assignment.\n\nA: Method 1) Use the compose key. \nCompose key sequences for €\ncompose key+c+=\nor\ncompose key+e+=\nIn fact, you can type the characters following the compose key in either order. \nSo\ncompose key+=+c\nor\ncompose key+=+e also work.\nTo set the compose key in 13.10, \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts or System Settings >> Text Entry >> Keyboard Settings.\n\n*Choose Typing in the left column.\n\n*Click Compose Key and choose an option from the pop-up list. Right-Alt is a common choice. \n\n\nTo set the compose key in earlier versions, \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings >> Keyboard Layout >> Options. \n\n*Click Compose Key Position to expand the list of options.\n\n\nCompose key options are hard-coded in Gnome-based systems. See the Gtk compose key table.\nMethod 2) Use the Alternative Characters Key (also called the 3rd level chooser in earlier versions\nThis way is a little more complicated to set up, but will give you a 2-character sequence. \nThis requires dconf-editor. sudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Shortcuts >> Typing as above, click Alternative Characters Key, and choose an option from the pop-up. (You do not have to set the compose key to use this option, but if you set it, make sure the compose key and alternative characters are set to different keys.)\n\n*In dconf-editor, navigate to org >> gnome >> desktop >> input-sources\n\n*To the setting xkb-options add one of the following:\n'eurosign:e'\n'eurosign:2'\n'eurosign:4'\n'eurosign:5'\nThe single-quotes are required. If you already have options listed, separate strings with commas.\nFor example, I have the compose key set to right-alt, the alternative character set to menu, and euro set to 4. The setting looks like this:\n['eurosign:4','lv3:menu_switch','compose:ralt']\n\nThe order of the strings doesn't matter. You can see that I chose the menu key and put the euro symbol on 4.\nNow, alternative char key+4 produces €.\n\nA: This is a way to enter any Unicode character, especially for those with no Alt Gr key.  \nPress\nCtrl+Shift+U and type Unicode sequence:\n20AC\nPress Space and a '€' symbol will appear.\n\nA: Alt Gr + 5 = €                              .\n\nA: The trick is to find the keyboard layout contained in @fabby's answer above. To do that in Ubuntu 15.10, tap the Super key to show the Finder, search for and open keyboard, click the text entry link, then the little keyboard icon underneath the keyboard sources box in the window that appears:\n.\nYou will then see the keyboard layout for your own configuration:\n\nand should be able to find the € sign or any other special character you're looking for.\n\nA: It seems the best two choices (on Linux Mint 20) are:\nEnglish (US, alt. intl.)\n\n*\n\n*sets € under AltGr + 5 and AltGr + e\n\n*sets ¢ under AltGr + Shift + e\n\n*sets quotes and such to need an extra <space> to form\n\nEnglish (US, euro on 5)\n\n*\n\n*set € under AltGr + 5\n\n*doesn't have the ¢ option\n\n*doesn't set quotes and such to need an extra <space> to form\n\n\nA: In Character Map, select Common.\n\n\nA: On my UK keyboard, Alt Gr + 4 = €\nPS:If you use a compose key (I use Win+Right) then I can use \"=\"+\"e\"  but no need in doing that since the first method described here is easier\nI stress again this is on a UK keyboard layout.\n\nA: Instead of the standard English (US) keyboard, switch to the English (US, alternative international) keyboard and you'll get the € under Alt GrE and you'll be able to type most Western-European languages, including Français, Español, Italiano (Pasta al ragù), Nederlands (zeeën), Deutsch (Doppelgänger), ...\nHere's the keyboard layout:\n\nNote: Alt Gr is the right Alt\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04 , the shortcut is: AltGr(right Alt) + E\n\nA: On an Ubuntu 13.10 Macbook Air 2013 with an English (Mac) keyboard, the shortcut is\nShift + Right Alt + 2\n\nA: It is simple on my Lubuntu 18.04 keyboard, AltGr + 4 does it.

Many Java-based applications have the problem where the windows created by the application are not associated with the shortcut used to start the application (so the dock contains multiple copies of the same icon).\nSo the field called StartupWMClass is a string that defines in which class the application is grouped in the Unity Launcher at startup.\nYou can find out which WM_CLASS your window has got when you type in a terminal:\nxprop WM_CLASS\n\nand then click at the window. In case of the gnome terminal the output is as follows:\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"gnome-terminal\", \"Gnome-terminal\"\n\nSo all windows with WM_CLASS \"gnome-terminal\" and \"Gnome-terminal\" are grouped together.\n", "Q: Live CD stalls when installing Ubuntu 13.10 Booting from Live CD Ubuntu 13.10 64bits, I can't get the installation page.

See fstab(5).\n#\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n# / was on /dev/sdc1 during installation\nUUID=34b6be44-858b-42dc-a730-08ea8f622ef6 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sdc5 during installation\n#UUID=835004e4-cfab-4d20-b4f8-27327d8ce6ef none            swap    sw              0       0\n# swap was on /dev/sdd5 during installation\n#UUID=d0a5e5b8-c644-465a-82ab-46e561c19f9c none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap2 none swap sw 0 0\nUUID=697A-2902 /home/nicola/Storage/    vfat    uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022,sync,auto,rw   0   0\n\nI rebooted and was amazed to see Storage pop up as mounted, as well as in my home directory.  Here's the issue though, when I open it, it appears empty.  I have checked the code and it seems to be correct, what could be causing this?\nany help would be greatly appreciated\n\nA: In terminal:\n$ sudo df -H    \n/dev/sdb1  1.0T  155G  846G  16% /media/F1FD-B614\n\nThis is my 1tb second internal hard drive. It is located at /media/F1FD-B614.\nNote that it's boot location is /dev/sdb1.\n$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"F1FD-B614\" TYPE=\"vfat\"\n\nI find my boot location in the list. Now I have my UUID and my type info.\n$ cd /etc\n$ sudo gedit fstab\n\nNow go to the bottom of fstab and enter the following lines. The first is just a \ncomment to remind you what the entries are. The second is an example of what you would get using values from the procedure above. You will undoubtedly get different values for UUID and mount locations, and perhaps also the boot location. Don't use the sample values. Use the values you get from your own terminal session. I had to go through about 10 different web sites to consolidate this information so nobody really gets the credit.\nHere are the lines to add in fstab:\n#UUID= 'uuid from blkid' 'location from sudo df -H' 'type from blkid'  defaults 0 2\nUUID=F1FD-B614 /media/F1FD-B614 vfat    defaults    0   2\n\nSave the file and reboot the system. It worked fine for me. When you get it working with its original location in the /media directory, you may be able to change its mount location, but what's the point- it already works.\nUPDATE: I found that the above method has a problem in that 'Create new folder' and other options are greyed out. The reason for this is because the method creates a mount that only has root permissions. To fix this do the following in terminal:\n$ id -u\n1000\n\n$ id -g\n1000\n\n$ cd /etc\n$ gksudo gedit fstab\n\nThe first two commands give you your user id and group id respectively. The values must be added to the options field of the fstab entry for the drive to be auto-mounted. In fstab I modified my entry as follows:\nUUID=F1FD-B614 /media/F1FD-B614 vfat defaults,umask=007,uid=1000,gid=1000    0    2\n\nApparently I had to use this tecnique because my second drive is formatted as fat32 (vfat). Apparently NTFS would have the same issue.

Prior to switching to Ubuntu I had reliable connection at least twice that far and all of my other wifi items still connect at beyond 30 ft.  Prior to disabling the firmware power saving feature I could not stay connected within close proximity to the router.  Because this seems to have helped I am going to look for the instructions I saw on how to disable another power saving feature for the wireless card.  I'll post both the command that I used already and the other command once I find them again- they were both in the same post.\n**update: the commands I ran were:\nsudo modprobe -v rtl8192ce ips=0 fwlps=0\n\n....but they don't seem to get a reliable signal from more than about 15 feet from the router. Again, numerous other wifi devices get the signal over 30 feet away and this computer did as well until Ubuntu.

Regarding 13 and the 9 month support- does that mean I will have to install a new version of Ubuntu in 9 months to continue getting security/other updates? Or will 13 then just become the new LTS? I know that's a very basic question but hey, I'm a Linux noob!  \n\nA: Use \nsudo iwconfig wlan0 retry 20 \n\nto get a better range out of your laptop. This will increase the retry for failed requests.\n\nA: My laptop start crashing with the latest kernels (3.5.0-47-generic and 48 too)\nso I downloaded the drivers direct from Realtek. I was worried since they had listed there kernels pre and post 2.6.24. That is a bit old. However 3.5.0-47 is post...\nBut having enough with the complete crash and need to reboot, I gave it a try.\nAnd I am glad I did!\n\nHere is the page to the driver.\nExtract then follow the readme. I think you need to this for every new kernel update, as it updated the current kernel only.\n\nA: get the latest drivers then select 2nd antena, apparently rtl8192ce chipset supports dual-antenna-wifi, but some manufacturers only build one physical antenna into their products this is the reason for your bad reception, just do:\nsudo modprobe -v rtl8192ce ant_sel=2\n\nand save it in the config:\nsudo /bin/sh -c 'echo \"options rtl8192ce ant_sel=2\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8192ce.conf'\n\n", "Q: Failed to install ubuntu 13.10 and it also corrupted my windows 7 i tried to install ubuntu 13.10 from bootable usb but it failed and it also corrupt my windows 7. \nthen again i tried to install ubuntu it shows that i have no operating system currently. i select the first option for installation that erase data and install(something like that) i do it but after completion of installation it again shows the option to install ubuntu or use without installation.\nso, i want to ask that first thing that my all partition that i have created in window 7 will remains in exist or not?\nand how to solve this problem?\n\nA: After the installation process is complete, you should reboot / restart the computer without the live usb installation media removed, and Ubuntu will boot from hard drive.  \nIf you selected the option to erase all data and install, and the installation process was successful, then your partitions were most likely delete.   \n", "Q: Can a full version of Ubuntu be Installed on a USB Drive? I have installed Ubuntu several times on my thumb drive. First times were on 8 GB thumb drives.\nI noticed I could not save anything as when I rebooted, it was all gone.\nSo, I got a 30 GB drive, tried installing again... and same thing.\nNow I've found out I am running a LIVE version... not actually an installation.\nSo, for the somewhat novice who cannot do command-line installs, \nstep by step is there a way to install ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-i386.iso using, unetbootin-windows-585.exe to a 30 GB USB stick using my Windows 7 machine?\n\nA: Method 1\nUse a Linux Live USB creator that supports persistence - having files and settings carry over between reboots. You should note that this really sucks the life out of your USB. It won't last more than a few months of use.\nMethod 2\nFor something a bit more long term, get 2 USBs. On one, do what you've been doing so so far. On the other, do whatever you want- it'll be wiped and Ubuntu will be installed onto it. Let's call this second one the 'other' USB.\nBoot from your Live USB as you have been doing before. Plug in your other USB. On your live desktop, you should see a little icon called Install Ubuntu 12.04. Run this. It may take a while every time you click something but be patient. By the way, be sure to check both boxes about installing updates while downloading, and about using proprietary software.\nWhen choosing installation type, hit Something Else and choose your other USB. You can probably get away with making one partition on it that fills the entire thing. Also, install the boot loader to your other USB. This is in a drop down box on the partitioning screen.\nThe rest of the installation is pretty self explanatory.\nYou clearly know how to boot from a USB, so if all goes well this should be perfect.\nGood Luck.\n\nA: This has been answered in the past, of which I reproduce here for you my previous answer.\n\nThe answers in this question:\n  Is there a way to install Ubuntu on usb pendrive as normal instalation (not live cd)?\n  are also applicable to SD Cards. (Tested by me)\nPay special attention to this:\n\nAnyway I suggest you to disconnect all your hard disk drives in your\n    computer, specially those which are having a OS installed (Windows,\n    Linux, etc.) as you may finish having a multi-boot USB/SD Memory with\n    GRUB and in certain cases the bootloader can be written in a different\n    device, other than the USB Memory/SD Card.\n\nIncluded in my answer here.\n\nPlease also see the answers to this question: Is there a way to install Ubuntu on usb pendrive as normal instalation (not live cd)?\nBTW: After installing in a USB/SD Card you can install whatever you want, and keep as many files as the capacity of the USB/SD allows. You can even use the USB/SD in a different computer without any problems.\nGood luck!\n\nA: If using a smaller flash drive you want to add persistence. That does not modify live versions, but allows saving some things. If an app is saved, it in effect has to be reinstalled on every boot. But it can be useful to let you save settings or your data files.\nIf using a large flash drive it is no different than any install to another hard drive or external USB hard drive. You may want to make some changes to reduce writes and use ext4 and change it to not use journal or use ext2 to reduce writes. Supposedly there are some advantages to ext4 even without journalling. \nOn the screen for auto install or Something Else or manual install you want manual install. All auto options install grub2 to the first internal drive; only manual install gives options on where to install boot loader and you want it in external flash drive. You do have to size, format and specify mount of / (root), swap and any other partitions if separate. If you have a lot of RAM you may not need nor want swap on a flash drive.\nHow do I install Ubuntu?\nSome that installed standard installer to flash, then have full install issues with first the few sectors still having ISO info that interferes. If you have issues, run Boot-Repair and it will zero out the first 2047 sectors and reinstall GRUB.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: Mouse cursor disappearing at every second boot Ubuntu 13.10 Since I installed Ubuntu 13.10 my mouse cursor has been disappearing every second time i boot Ubuntu 13.10. So the way I solve it is by restarting Ubuntu, and the mouse cursor will become visible again. If I would then want to make a restart again, the cursor will be gone until a restart has been done. So to sum up - every second boot will show a cursor, and the other will not.\nNow of course I can keep on doing like this, but it is VERY annoying. So i would ask if there was a way of solving this.

To try, in terminal \ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false\n\nTo re-enable just run same command but use true instead of false\n\nA: I have this issue happen randomly on Ubuntu Gnome 15.04 (sometime at boot time, sometime while the system is up): the mouse cursor doesn't show up but the mouse can still be used. One way to make it reappear that worked for me, is to change the resolution back and forth.

Besides turn off journaling first at all, it is capital equalize the UID and GUI; in MacOs your user is 501/20 and on Ubuntu 1001/99 or higher.\nBe careful, because you must let Ubuntu show user ID < 1000 - explained below - or in your next boot your user will not appear!\nThe complete guide are in this 2 links:\nMultiplataform guide, including MacOs, Linux and Windows\nBy default, the first user in OS X has a UID of 501, but you can double check this by going into System Preferences in OS X, right-clicking on your user, and hitting Advanced Options. If your User ID is something different from 501, replace 501 with your other UID in the terminal commands below.\nBoot into Linux (we're using Ubuntu in this example) and fire up the Terminal. First, we're going to add a temporary user, since we don't want to edit a user that we're currently logged into. So, run the following commands in the Terminal, hitting Enter after each one:\nsudo useradd -d /home/tempuser -m -s /bin/bash -G admin tempuser\n\nsudo passwd tempuser\n\nType in a new password for the temporary user when prompted. Reboot and log in as tempuser. Then, open up the Terminal and type in the following commands, once again hitting enter after each one (and replacing yourusername with your Linux user's username):\nsudo usermod --uid 501 yourusername\n\nsudo chown -R 501:yourusername /home/yourusername\n\nThis will change your Linux user's UID to 501 and fix your home folder permissions so that you still own them. Now, you should be able to read and write to both your Mac and Linux user's home folder, no matter what OS you're logged into.\nYou may also want to fix your login screen, since by default Ubuntu won't list users with a UID of less than 1000. To do this, just open a Terminal and run \n    gksudo gedit /etc/login.defs\nand search for UID_MIN in the text file. Change that value from 1000 to 501, and when you reboot your user will be listed in the login screen.\nGo to the post from the user Frobber\nTo access OSX partitions from the Linux side, the UID and GID must match the OSX UID and GID. During OSX install, the first user and OSX administrator is assigned UID 501 and GID 20. When a Linux system is installed, the user IDs start at 1000. \nWe can change our user IDs to match the IDs for the MacOS from the Linux side.\nTo verify our UID and GID on the Mac side, login, open a terminal and Type – id. The response will display the required information.\nThe UID and GID cannot be changed for a user that is logged in. \nWith Ubuntu we need to create a 'Temp' user with administrative privileges, and perform the procedure while logged in as the 'Temp'. The 'Temp' user will use sudo -i to change to root user. \nThe following procedure is written for a system that has 'Root' user capabilities, and nano is the editor.. \nNote: All we are doing is changing the ID numbers and nothing else.\n1.At the login screen, Key – control+alt+F1. Observe that we have entered console mode.\n2.Log in as root, or the Temp user.\nEdit the file /etc/login.defs. Type:\nnano /etc/login.defs\n\nFind the value UID_MIN.

However, when I enable static addresses and restart, the machine does not get the ip address I requested (192.168.1.70), instead getting a different one (192.168.1.111) disabling the NIC altogether. I have also tried requesting a different ip address (192.168.1.199) in case the old one was taken, but that too results in the NIC being disabled.\nI am asking this question here as google/SO does not seem to have an answer specifically pertaining to what users should do, and how they should proceed when simply \"googling the problem\" and quickly updating a single file does not result in static addresses. I am specifically requesting the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*An answer as to why this may not be working (ie. whether this is Ubuntu 13.10 related).\n\n*How to debug the network initialization during boot.\n\n*How to finally set up static ip addressing.\n\n\nEDIT:\nAs per Atari's requests, I tried setting the IP using the GUI instead of the command line. To do this, I had to purge the /etc/network/interfaces file first (by commenting out the static related lines), restarting, then trying again. If I do not do this, I can not even access the options of my NIC. This did assign a static IP to my computer, however, now I only have local access to and from it (via ssh) with absolutely no access to the internet.\n\nA: I would try to use the GUI to set the static IP. If that works then you know that you are using the NetworkManager package to control that NICs IP. The package should disable itself for the interface if it is mentioned in the manual config (as per: https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager) But that seems to not be happening.\nYou can also remove the NetworkManager completely with...\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome\nsudo apt-get remove network-manager\n...and then attempt to change it manually.\n\nA: You are missing the line which will cause the configuration to be run at startup. \nEdit your /etc/network/interfaces configuration and add the line:\nauto eth0\n\nIn the mean time, you can set the static address with the command: \nsudo ifup eth0\n\nIt you want to have the interface to start only when you are connected to a specific network, check the documentation and examples for the ifupdown package.  In particular, look at the mapping command.   The ping-places.sh command can be useful in identifying which network you are on.\n\nA: It seems I am a little late, but still:\nSince I think 12.04 you are screwed if you want to invest little work and get stuff done via the old /etc/network/interfaces.\nBut there's hope ! :D\nJust use /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/CONNECTIONS\nIf you take a standard system connected via ethernet the file usually looks like this:\nfilename: Wired connection 1\ncontent:\n[802-3-ethernet]\nduplex=full\nmac-address=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\n[connection]\nid=Wired connection 1\nuuid=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\ntype=802-3-ethernet\ntimespamp = xxxxxxxxxx\n\n[ipv6]\nmethod=auto\n\n[ipv4]\nmethod=manual\ndns=192.168.0.1\naddress=192.168.0.123/24,192.168.0.1\n\n\nA: I found this is easily done on your router. I don't know what type of router you may have but there should be an option where you can have your MAC address map to a specific IP address on your LAN. This is the setup I have...\n\nA: You're almost there. ssh works, a fixed IP is ok. Now the only thing missing is of course the dns. That's why you fail to get on the internet. Your gateway is 192.168.1.1 and that's presumably a router. Many of them provide dns, so simply try 192.168.1.1 as nameserver\n\nA: need the auto eth0, other than that once you have the code do a full reboot and the change will take place.\nifconfig eth0 up/down does not make the change.\n\nA: When you use the ifdown and ifup use the -v option to print any error \nafter that you should kill the dhcp deamond by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T (to open a terminal )  and type : sudo killall dhcp and enter your password . \n", "Q: Will I reduce the life of my SSD prematurely?

The ESP holds EFI boot loaders and associated files. The /boot directory (or partition, if it's a separate partition) holds the Linux kernel. I'm not a LUKS expert, but presumably the Linux kernel is kept outside of LUKS because that enables the boot loader to read it without having to understand LUKS encryption. In your configuration, /boot is encrypted, so the boot loader would need to understand encryption in order to work. That could be why it's failed.\nIn other words, try again, but this time, do create a separate /boot partition in addition to the ESP.\n", "Q: Make notifications bubble shorter These kind of notifications appear when I change volume, dropbox gets new files, etc. they stay there for about 10 seconds, This is what too long it should be around 2 seconds.

Details are below, the TL;DR version is as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*The Skype install (I think) borked a video driver and caused a crash.\n\n*Somehow, the Skype install made Ubuntu think it was a 32 bit box, so when I tried to to \"recover\" after a restart, selecting the recovery boot option, and using the \"fix installed packages\" menu option, dpkg \"helpfully\" removed my 64 bit libraries/kernel and installed the 32 bit versions instead. \n\n*Removing Skype didn't give me my 64 bit version back. \n\n\nHow do I get my 64 bit install back? Is this just a re-install at this point? \nDetails\nI tried using the documentation here. For some reason, the line\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\ndidn't work. It complained:\ndpkg: error: unknown option --add-architecture\n\nBravely,  naively, I went on. These commands went just fine.\n sudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner\"\n sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install skype\n\nI launched Skype. It worked. The audio test worked fine. The video wouldn't work. I did some more searching. I'm on a Lenovo Y510p and the camera detected as an EasyCam but it was just giving me a green rectangle instead of showing my video. \nI found this answer, so I hit Fn-Esc. I also double clicked on the green rectangle.\nOh dear Lord was that a bad idea.\nMy screen went blank. Nothing was working. I used Ctrl-F1 to get to a terminal... a sea of error messages were pouring down -- I logged in (blindly!) and typed \n killall skype\n\nThe messages stopped. (I don't recall what they said.) I tried Ctrl-F7 back to X, but that X session was still black. I rebooted my box.\nIt hung on an error that said something about \n TDMS table invalid.\n\nNot knowing what to do, I rebooted, went selected the rescue option from the boot loader, and tried to \"repair installed packages\". \nWhat happened next was really weird: It installed the i386 kernel, even though this is a 64 bit box.\nThe 32 bit kernel booted okay. I removed skype via \n apt-get remove skype\n apt-get autoremove\n\nBut I can't get my 64 bit kernel back. How do I do that? \n\nA: The best way to do this would be to reinstall Ubuntu.\nSorry.\nIf you are REALLY brave, you can reinstall all your packages with the x64 version, but that would just take way too long and there's no guarantee that it would work.\nSimilar thread:\nHow can I switch a 32-bit installation to a 64-bit one?\n", "Q: VPN Service without having to set up VPN server? I want to have a VPN for my pc so people cannot see my IP address and know my location, but I haven't found out a way to do so?\nIf I can set up a free VPN server, let me know how, because I would like to have one!\nThanks!\n\nA: If you do not want to use VPN and only want to surf from a different IP you can always setup SSH on your home computer and then log into that and run the browser on your remote machine.\nInstall openSSH:\nsudo apt-get install openssh\nTest your connection from within your local network:\nssh -x <computers IP>\nThen run the command for your browser once you are logged in...\nfirefox\nThis will bring up firefox from the other computer with a secure connection between the two. Essentially you will be browsing from the other computer and all traffic will appear to be coming from the computer in your home rather than the computer you are actually on. This is not the same as a VPN but it may work for what you appear to be trying to do... and without having to setup a VPN server.\nTo access the computer from outside your local network you will need to open port 22 on your router/firewall and forward the traffic at that port to the machine at your home. \nI use this when i am browsing the internet at a coffee shop in order to encrypt all of my browsing whether or not i am visiting a https site. \nEDIT:\nI think what you are looking for is a proxy service.\nIf you want to use a proxy service you can find those on the web (look in the comments).\nTo tell your Ubuntu install to use the proxy service do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings\n\n*Select Network then Network Proxy\n\n*Under the Method pull-down select manual \n\n*Enter in the IP of the proxy you would like to use (see lists in link below)\n\n*Click Apply system wide\nThis will effectively route your traffic through the proxy which can be located anywhere in the world.\n", "Q: How to remove text from file icons? I am fairly new to Ubuntu (Linux). I noticed when creating a .java file or .py gives me an icon, however when I start writing code it overrides the thumbnail into showing text. Is there a way to disable this silly feature ? When I installed Linux Mint on the VM I noticed I was able to accomplish this task by unchecking \"Show text in icon\". I know they use Namo as their file manager. \nI read this thread and it did not work.  How to stop Nautilus from creating thumbnails of specific file types?\n\nA: There's a setting for this in Nautilus (3.4 here, can't confirm if it still works on more recent revisions):\nEdit → Preferences → Preview → Set Show text in icons to Never\n\n", "Q: Removing Applications Menu Listing with CLI command I am trying to make an application installer item in the menu. Where once you click on it, it executes the command to install the program. I can use apt-get for this and a custom launcher.\nHowever, after the application is installed, how can I make it so that it automatically removes the \"Installer Launcher\" once the app is installed?\nForgive me if I was unclear, I was unsure how to state my question.\nPS: I am using the xfce(xubuntu) environment.\n\nA: You can find out what launchers something has installed by running:\ndpkg -L <package> | grep -E \"^/usr.*share.*desktop\\$\"\n\nThat will list the files. You can either delete those (I'm not sure I would) or rename them to something else (like sticking a .disabled on the end).

This command tells you how big your apt cache is:\ndu -sh /var/cache/apt/archives\n\nTo clean the apt cache on Ubuntu simply run the following command.\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nThe apt clean command removes ALL packages kept in the apt cache, regardless of age or need. If you’re on a slow, capped or intermittent connection you may want to consider skipping this step.\nSource.\n\nA: Polipo, a web caching program may store a lot of data in an on-disk cache.\nOne way to clear this up is to issue the command sudo polipo -x - this will cause polipo to clear the local disk cache.\n\nA: The most powerful of all commands to clean the cache for command line users is of course\nsudo apt clean\n\nWhich will also delete all the cached files.\n\nA: Go to settings > privacy > File history & Trash scroll down and click delete temporary files.\n", "Q: Errors with USB device during boot? Explanation\nI just built a new computer. Here are the specs:\nMotherboard: Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3\nCPU: AMD FX 8350\nSSD: SAMSUNG 840 Pro Series MZ-7PD256BW\nRAM: G.SKILL F3-1600C9Q-32GXM\nInitially I tried to install Linux Mint 15 with XFCE from a Live DVD. The live DVD loaded, but my keyboard and mouse where not detected or mounted, so I couldn't install it. After some googling I discovered that some of my BIOS settings were probably causing the problem. I enabled the network stack and the IOMMU controller (described here and here) and then usb devices started to work and I was able to install Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS. But I really wanted Mint 15 with XFCE, so I installed that again and it worked this time! But then I noticed that I \"couldn't\" get a network connection. So then I reinstalled Ubuntu again. After installing Ubuntu, I realized that for some reason or another the Automatic DHCP wasn't working. I switched it to a manual configuration, and after rebooting the computer (not sure why I had to reboot to get the config to work) I had network connectivity. Well geez, I still wanted Mint, so I reinstalled yet again!\nLong story short - I now have Mint 15 with XFCE up and running. But its still not perfect. The boot time takes forever and there is no indication that the computer is booting other than the color of the LED on my monitor. The screen is black, no graphical information whatsoever indicating the OS is loading. After waiting a few minutes (I haven't timed it but I think its about 4 or 5 minutes) I finally get the login screen. But when I try to use the USB keyboard or mouse, they still don't work. I know this sounds confusing because I said everything is up and running. Well, the problem is that I have to wait somewhere between 1 to 2 minutes before the keyboard and mouse are functional. I can live with this, but it feels like something still isn't working right. \nI get the same results with Mint 15 and Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS.\nI made sure the motherboard has the latest BIOS installed. I tried to update the drivers for the LAN, Realtek 8111E (the website says \"LINUX driver for kernel 3.x and 2.6.x and 2.4.x\") but when I untar r8168-8.037.00.tar.bz2 the README file states \"Kernel source tree (supported Linux kernel 2.6.x and 2.4.x)\" so I didn't install it because I'm running:\n$ uname -a\nLinux bugger 3.8.0-25-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 6 20:47:07 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nHere are snipets from /var/log/syslog.

Sometimes it works (with manual configuration, not with auto DHCP) after starting the computer, and sometimes it does not. The USB devices will work, after waiting about 2 minutes after the login screen apears. But if both the USB devices and the LAN are working after a system boot, then they seem to work fine... until the next time the system boots up again. Its just hit and miss.\nQuestion\nAs can be seen from the log file, I'm still having problems with the USB and LAN devices. How can I fix these problems? Maybe some other BIOS settings, other drivers, or maybe submit a bug somewhere?\nThanks.\nEDIT\nI used a stopwatch to know the boot/mouse ready times.\nBoot  time: 1:53.50\nMouse time: 1:22.16\nTotal time: 3:15.66\n\nThis means from the time I pressed the power on button to the time I got a login screen it took 1:53. Then it took an additional 1:22 before the mouse and keyboard were operational (with \"ohci_hcd\" usb 1.0 support rather that \"ehci-pci\" usb 2.0 support). The total time before I could log into the machine was 3:15.\nIs 1:53 a normal amount of time for the OS to boot given the specified hardware?\n\nA: Try turning off IOMMU support in the BIOS.  I have the same system and I'm just starting to set it up.  With IOMMU enabled, I see the same IO_PAGE_FAULT device:01:00.0 errors;\nwith it disabled, those errors went away, as did related errors from xhci_hcd (USB 3.0).\n", "Q: swap problem in ubuntu 12.04 Having problem with swap.

I'm using Ubuntu 13.10, but I think the keyboard shortcut wasn't bound in 12.10, but could be wrong.\nIt's not in the shortcuts tab of keyboard settings. How can I change the Unicode input from Ctrl+Shift+U to other?\n\nA: Control+Shift+u for unicode input is hard-coded into the GTK+3 default input method. (Source: GtkIMContext). \nThe easiest thing to do is probably to use a different set of keys for whatever functions you need.\nBut you have some other options for Gtk applications. Both involve replacing the default input method with no input method.\nIn gedit and in gnome-terminal, you can right-click the window and choose Input Methods >> None. This may be a good solution if you do not need an input method for other reasons and do not need the features of LibreOffice.\nFor LibreOffice, there does not appear to be a way to bypass the system input method. If you do not need an input method, you can turn it off system-wide by going to System Settings >> Language Support and setting Keyboard input method system to none. You must reboot for this to take effect. (Logging out was not enough.)\nNote that this method is only hard-coded into Gtk applications. If you do not mind installing KDE dependencies, you can use an editor like kate and change the accelerators to suit your need.\n\nA: I was able to bypass this binding by unsetting 'XMODIFIERS' System variable just before launching my application (Intellij IDEA) to prevent toggle case keyset conflict.\nexport XMODIFIERS=\"\"\nmyapp.sh\n\nTested on Ubuntu 18.10, libgtk-3-0 3.24.1-1ubuntu2\n", "Q: How can I add Times New Roman WITH IPA EXTENSIONS? I'm looking for an easy way to install the Times New Roman font (which I need for my dissertation) that has the IPA extensions. The one that comes with the ttf-mscorefonts-installer does not have them, and I was hoping that someone here would know which version does.\n\nA: You may not need to. Many applications, for example LibreOffice Writer and Inkscape, will automatically fall back to displaying missing glyphs with whatever next-best font covers them. You can see how substitutes rank on your system with fc-match:\n$ fc-match -a 'Times New Roman' family | uniq\nTimes New Roman\nLiberation Serif\nNimbus Roman No9 L\nDejaVu Serif\n…\n\nIt's no surprise that the first choice for Times New Roman is Times New Roman itself (license: proprietary). Restricting the results to those that cover the IPA extensions eliminates Ubuntu's partial distribution of Times New Roman (intended for, but not restricted to, web use), as you've seen, but it doesn't eliminate everything:\n$ fc-match -av 'Times New Roman' \\\n  | grep --perl-regexp '\\s*(family|0002):' \\\n  | grep --before-context 1 '0002: ........ ........ ....ffff ffffffff ffff.... ........ ........ ........' \\\n  | grep --only-matching --perl-regexp '(?<=family: \").*(?=\")' | uniq\nDejaVu Serif\nFreeSerif\nDoulos SIL\nDejaVu Sans\n\nWhat this means is that, in supporting applications, when you enter a character belonging to the IPA extensions and set its font to Times New Roman, you will actually see a glyph from DejaVu Serif (license: free nonstandard).\nThis should allow you to compose documents that would use the IPA extensions of Times New Roman if they're available, but which don't on your system only as a matter of presentation.\nThe one thing you may want to change is which fonts are substituted for display of the IPA extensions on your system, since DejaVu Serif is substantially different from Times New Roman and in my opinion makes a poor substitute for it. I'd recommend configuring your system to give higher preference to FreeSerif (license: GPL), which is metric-compatible with Times New Roman. Doulos SIL (license: OFL) is very similar, but it has has slightly different metrics and is only available in regular weight.\n", "Q: Lenovo Ideapad p500 having Windows 8 booting issues.

Check if your touchpad is enabled\nOpen dconf Editor, navigate to org → gnome → settings-daemon → peripherals → touchpad and make sure that tauchpad-enable is enabled/ticked (check also the other options):\n\nCheck also from terminal with the following command:\nsynclient | grep Touchpad\n\nIf the output is different than:\nTouchpadOff             = 0\n\nthen your touchpad is off and you should put it on using the following command:\nsynclient Touchpadoff=0\n\nIf the problem still persists, then go forward to the step II.\nII. Reinstall xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\nTo reinstall xserver-xorg-input-synaptics package, run the following command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n\nAfter the reinstallation is finished, reboot your system. If the problem still persists, check again if your touchpad is enabled using dconf Editor, then go forward to the step III.\nIII. Change the module for your touchpad\nIf the previous solutions didn't work, do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Create a file called touchpad.conf in /etc/modprobe.d/ using the following command in terminal:\n sudo -i gedit /etc/modprobe.d/touchpad.conf\n\n\n\n*Add the following line inside the touchpad.conf file just created:\n options psmouse proto=imps\n\n\n\n*Save the file and close it.\n\n\n*Reboot your system,\nAfter reboot your touchpad should work normally.\n\nA: Create a configuration file for the touchpad:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/modprobe.d/touchpad.conf\n\nCopy and then paste into the touchpad.conf file:\noptions psmouse proto=imps\n\nSAVE file and reboot.\n", "Q: Driver for VFS5011 Fingerprint Reader on Dell Vostro 3550 I have a Dell Vostro 3550 laptop.\nFingerprint Reader: Validity Sensors, Inc.

I realized this is not entirely obvious from the documentation. \nWhen I search for something in the Dash, a UUID and a search phrase is sent to productsearch.ubuntu.com, providing the Smart Scopes service. If I then act upon one of these results, then that is reported along with the UUID. This is fine. \nHowever, what if this search results in a local file and I click to open this file. Is that action too sent to the Smart Scopes server, or does that only apply to results that actually came from the Smart Scopes server? \n\nA: And I'm happy too answer my own question on this one. I asked Michael Hall from Canonical and he confirmed that they will not see which file I clicked on, but only that I activated something local. \nThat's good.

I don't understand the logic behind this. If a notification pops up and I want it to stay a little longer, I can hover it, but the notification fades, which makes it illegible.

A very good example are todays Windows .exe-files, which have only very little in common with the .exe-files that were common during the 90s.\nFile extensions are rather recommendations or naming conventions for certain datatypes (or MIME types), which are mostly application specific. That is how most modern operating systems like Linux and Windows handle datatypes: When applications are installed, they register datatypes that they can handle in the system. That way the user can focus more on productivity by working with or using applications.\nInstalling software\nOpen source Linux software is initially published as source code, or rather archives there of. Popular extensions/formats are .tar.gz, .tar.bz or the newer .tar.xz.\nSome companies also publish closed source Linux software as compiled binaries in an installer with a .run extension along with installation instructions. If you have problems installing proprietary software consult the offical documentation or contact the companies customer support.\nDistributions like Ubuntu package and publish source code as well as binaries. For the binaries the Debian specific package format with the extension .deb is used. Other distributions like Fedora use other extensions/formats, like .rpm.\n", "Q: not able to upgrade maas to 1.4?

Now this has to be done before checkpoint disk encryption is applied on the Windows7 partition.\nEverything was fine, I run Ubuntu on daily basis and once in a while boot into Windows7 to do mundane corporate tasks, it usually works fine with hibernate/resume into Windows7.\nThis is irrelevant, but I need to get this rant of my chest\nI also do hibernate/resume into Ubuntu and that works fine as well, except that sometimes the compiz window manager crashes and fails to be restarted, after a wake up from hibernate (I think it's an i915 driver issue according to google).\nIn such a moment, when compiz had crashed and I needed to finish some work, I quickly installed and tested a couple of window managers (twm, wmaker, XFCE-4) to be able to keep working without rebooting.\nOne of those FU**ING PIECE OF S**T packages found it amusing to change the grub splash to a DEBIAN F***ING S**TLOOKING SPLASH , \"la la la, I'll just change the splash to make the world a better place and innocently run grub-update...\" without ever F***ING ask me whether its okay to F*** around with my delicate but working dual boot environment (requires two Window7 boot attempts to get past the checkpoint disk encryption).\nThis is relevant\nSo on next reboot my option to run Windows7 on boot was gone, I tried grub-install, grub-update but it was not able to restore the Windows7 boot option. I can boot into Linux w:o problem, but the options to boot Windows7 is gone.\nSo I started googling and felt horror build up since every solution I found kept mentioning Windows7 repair CD, MBR restore, bla bla, NOT A F***ING OPTION IN A LOCKED DOWN CORPORATE BOOTIMAGE, I need to get it restored without a Windows7 repair CD or whatever.\nNow I'm much more relieved since I managed to boot into Windows7 using the grub cli by running the following commands:\n>chainloader (hd0,msdos1)+1\n>boot\n\nSo my question is how to get that back into my Grub boot menu as the option to run Windows7?\nThe reason I'm asking how to do this is that I'm terrified to F**CK up and loose my ability to boot into Windows7, because restoring what I have (had) requires a lot of mundane work (which includes calling to the outsourced help desk across the globe just to re-enable a network boot image for my laptop).\n\nA: Ok, I'm a bit more relaxed now since I believe I know why this happened. First, the follwing guide solved the actual problem of re-enabling Windows7\nManually adding an entry for Windows 7 to an Ubuntu GRUB2 menu\nThen the reason for the boot menu to loose Window7 was that when /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ran the first time, that was when I installed Ubuntu 12.04 direct after installing Windows7 but before checkpoint disk encryption was enabled, it correctly detected Windows7.\nBut now with checkpoint disk encryption active, grub fails to detect Windows7 and the boot option will not be added. As was the case when one of the packages executed update-grub after changing the grub splash.\nAs for which of the window managers that, as a side effect when being installed, ran update-grub2 and blew my current boot menu was xcfe4. Since it depends on desktop-base, which replaces/sets the grub splash with spacefun-grub.png and runs update-grub2.\nSo installing xcfe4 using apt-get install xcfe4 runs update-grub2 at one point!!!\nThis side effect has also made it into launchpad\n", "Q: Can't complete matlab installing I am student interested in ubuntu.

I just installed 12.04 LTS onto a second hard drive in my Windows 7 machine. Now when I start Ubuntu it sits there flickering between a whole ream of console output and a screen with the single word \"Ubuntu”. The console output seems to be the same screenful of information continuously repeated. The flickering is almost fast enough to make the two displays appear to merge into one. \nIt will keep doing this until I hit random keys on the keyboard (the arrow keys); once I let it go about 10 minutes and it still got nowhere until I hit some keys; after that it took a couple of minutes to finally reach the login screen.\nI had briefly trialled Ubuntu on another Windows 7 machine and had a completely different experience than this one. Most notably, instead of GRUB asking me which OS to load (on the other machine), I am seeing what appears to be the standard Windows boot selection. \nThe only differences between the two installations (other than a couple of month's passing of time) is that the first one was a 32-bit machine installed via USB whereas this one is 64-bit and I installed from a DVD.\nIt is not at all how I expected my experiment with Ubuntu to go. Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can make it start properly?\n\nA: I hadn't realized that I had installed the Wubi version of Ubuntu. After migrating it to a proper installation in its own partition the problems with the slow startup and flickering display have gone away. So, problem solved.\nRegarding the graphics card, I had forgotten when I made my original post that the GeForce card had died and I had removed it completely. So the computer is using the old onboard Intel graphics, which may have been part of the problem in the first place.\nI still have to figure out if it is safe to uninstall Wubi without affecting my computer's ability to boot, but that is a different issue to be solved at another time.\n\nA: seems like that you not have enabled the Lagacy support for your 64bit-CPU on your Bios, it is needed for an 32bit installation, Windows or Linux similar\n", "Q: Mobile Broadband worked in 13.04 not working in 13.10 Does anyone know why a Sierra Wireless USB mobile broadband modem would work perfectly in 13.04 but then stop working immediately after upgrading to 13.10?\n\nA: Can you please try this:\nDownload the package modemmanager0.5.1.97-0ubuntu1 from here or from here.\nOpen Synaptic Package Manager type in your password when required, search for the package named modemmanager when you find it, hit the right click on it and hit on Mark for complete removal and close the Synaptic Package Manager.\nLook for the file you downloaded before and execute it (it will may be open on the Ubuntu Software Center), install it and close the Ubuntu Software Center.\nNow open one more time the Synaptic Package Manager and search for the package named modemmanager again, when you find it click on it and go to the upper menu option Package, hit on Lock Version until you see a checkmark next to that option and a locker next to the package name.\nRestart your system and let us now if that worked.\n", "Q: Compiling error while installing Realtek RTL8111E in 64 bit 13.10. \"CONFIG_X86_X32 enabled but no binutils support\" I downloaded the Linux drivers for my onboard RTL8111E (Mobo MSI B75 Pro3-M) from the Realtek site. The Realtek driver has been updated 23/09/2013, so I assume it can handle 64 bit Ubuntu (13.10 in my case). It seems to be compatible with kernel 3.xx.\nI run autorun.sh as root but get the following error: “CONFIG_X86_X32 enabled but no binutils support”\nI didn't expect this error, as my OS is 64 bit. Does anybody know how to fix this ?\nKind regards,\nDavid.\n\nA: I finally found the cause thanks to this link.\nIt seems that one shouldn't have spaces in the folder names (containing the driver of course) when building the driver. Replacing the spaces with underscores fixed the issue. I could build just like that. Strange... but it worked!\n\nA: Compiling drivers involves a kernel header make, which can fail with CONFIG_X86_X32 enabled but no binutils support if the kernel source directory belongs to root and you're running as an unprivileged user. Check in your make output to see if CONFIG_X86_X32 enabled but no binutils support appears in the kernel source directory, in which case try building the kernel sources (or your entire driver source) with sudo make.\nAnother common cause of CONFIG_X86_X32 enabled but no binutils support is spaces in the compilation directory as mentioned by David Van Huffel or binutils not installed as mentioned by chili555. \n\nA: It 'makes' for me on my 64-bit system without drama except for a notation about private key which may safely be ignored.

I have Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 in dualboot. But the problem was that Windows didn't boot when GRUB is set as primary bootloader in BIOS. When the Windows EFI partition was checked as primary, Windows booted well.\nThen I decided to fix it and installed Boot-Repair. First of all, I made the backup. Then updated the GRUB. The update was successful. But then Windows and Ubuntu didn't boot at all.\nI've repaired GRUB using live-USB. Now I can boot Ubuntu, but Windows doesn't boot.\nHow can I restore boot partitions from Boot-Repair backup (.zip file)?\n\nA: First, try disabling Secure Boot. If it's enabled, some versions of GRUB can't boot Windows. This is a GRUB bug.\nIf that doesn't help, try installing my rEFInd boot manager. You can try the USB flash drive or CD-R image without installing it, if you like; or dive in all the way by installing the Debian-package version in Ubuntu. (Note that the USB flash drive/CD-R version will boot Ubuntu correctly only if you do not have a separate /boot partition or if you manually edit your kernel options.) rEFInd is less finicky about booting Windows than is GRUB, so it's more likely to work if GRUB gives you problems.\nIf you prefer to stick to GRUB, that may be possible, but you'll need to provide more details about what's not working, like any error messages you're getting, whether you see a Windows logo appear, etc.\nSometimes this problem can be caused by a missing Windows boot loader. (Typically you'll get some variety of \"file not found\" message, or rEFInd won't show a Windows option at all, if this is the case.) You'll need to either restore the Windows boot loader files from a backup or use a Windows emergency disc to re-install the files to fix this problem.\n", "Q: stop web integration to unity in Ubuntu 13.10?

If you've got something that's shunting things into swap from RAM, you're going to see:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU use for determining what can go into swap\n\n*Disk IO and CPU while moving from physical to swap\n\n*CPU use for mapping running applications address space to its swap location\n\n*Disk IO from application accessing their swapped memory space.\n\n\nHow quantifiable these are or how much of an effect they have is completely debatable but follow Barney's one golden rule: More RAM is always better.\n\nA: The Swap space is the area on the HDD or SSD which forms a part of the Virtual Memory of your PC. The Virtual Memory is simply a combination of your physical memory which is called RAM and the swap space which is call SWAP. The Swap space holds, temporarily, the memory that is inactive. This is because your system decides that it needs physical memory for active processes and it has insufficient unused physical memory available. If the system happens to need more memory or space, inactive memory pages in the physical memory are then moved to the swap space, freeing up that physical memory for other uses.\nSince physical memory or RAM is much faster than SWAP, which is found in a HDD or SDD, typically as a partition, the access time is slower. You can however get a faster speed if you use a SSD (Solid State Drive) instead of a HDD (Hard Disk Drive, Mechanical ones). \nWith this in mind, the answer to your question is, in both cases yes. Yes, using SWAP will increase your CPU usage and the Disk I/O. Of course the CPU usage will be minimal, but the Disk usage won't be. The reason is that the CPU is only used to see where and what can be stored/retrieved from swap (which is a very fast procedure).\nFor the Disk I/O it's different. Since Swap is in the HDD or SSD, it will also use the Disk I/O while you use other programs, and it will most likely have higher priority than other user programs.\nSo for your question, you do not need to worry much about CPU usage than Disk usage.\nTo enhance performance and lower disk usage you can do a couple of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change from an HDD (Typically 5400 RPM to 7200 RPM) to an SSD. The difference is 2x to 10x faster Disk performance. This will drastically change the overall performance on your system.\n\n*Add more RAM. If you have more memory RAM, the chance the system will need to swap memory will be lower, increasing the overall performance while still using all available RAM.\n\n*Use a Desktop that uses less RAM. This also expands to other apps. It is not the same to use KDE or Gnome than to use LXDE or XFCE. It is also not the same to use abiword or even nano o vim than to use LibreOffice.\nNow for the last point. What you heard about Increased Disk I/O increasing CPU load. This is true, simply because:\nThe less RAM you have, the more the SWAP space will be needed for your Apps. The more SWAP space is used, the more CPU time will be needed to store/retrieve Swap information.\nOne depends on the other. So increasing the amount of RAM will directly benefit you in lowering SWAP usage and lowering CPU usage.\nHere is an image to illustrate the effect:\n\nEvery time the CPU load jumped, it was because the Swap was been read/written to.\n\nA: There will some SOME increase (as the kernel has to track the location of the paged memory between RAM and secondary storage), but I doubt it will be much as the kernel accesses the disk directly , bypassing caching and file-system when paging in/out of the swap file/partition. The IO performed is asynchronous, so the CPU is not waiting (causing other processes to slowdown unnecessarily).\nFor a full description of the swap management read https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand014.html you will see that it is not a CPU intensive process, most of the work is around managing page mappings, not the transfer of data.\n\nA: It is the reverse actually: when programs have to stop and wait for disk IO, cpu usage drops ( since they aren't using it while waiting ).  Obviously lots of data being swapped in and out to disk is disk IO.\n", "Q: Laptop doesn't suspend when lid is closed I have LTS Ubuntu 12.04 and when I close my lid  the screen goes black but doesn't suspend because I can feel it getting warmer as if it was processing something. When I open it back up after an hour, I can see that all my battery is drained.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install laptop-mode-tools\n\nI had the same problem listed here. When the laptop lid closed, the screen turned black and the fan was still on and didn't resume when I opened the lid. After I installed this package, it suspended correctly and resumed when I opened it.\n\nA: Go to System Settings > Power . From there you can change this.

I wish to do it before doing a fresh install of an OS. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: All OS Uninstaller does is nuke disk partitions that it detects. It doesn't stop you booting to media like USB or CD...

It will generate a QR code to share the desktop screen or any app to any device running a browser (and supporting WebRTC).\nHere a video tutorial.\n", "Q: give user access to passwd command How to give permission for the new user account to have access to passwd command to allow this new user account to be able to change other account password?\nI tried zxcvbnm ALL= NOPASSWD:/etc/passwd but don't think my path name was correct. someone please help.\n\nA: As changing another user's password is an administrative task it should be done from a user with administrator permissions. Any such administrator has access to sudo and will then be able to change another user's password with the following command:\nsudo passwd USERNAME\n\nYou will be asked for your sudo password first, then you will have to enter the new password for the given user USERNAME twice.\nFrom the security point of view it does not make much sense to let non admintrator users change the passwords of all users. This would be a perfect way to gain administrator access (or to accidentally lock the administrator out).\nTherefore all users you need to be able to change the password of other users should have an administrator account (and be taught about the responsibility that comes with this).\n", "Q: What can cause \"Missing Package: header, Problem with MergeList, The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened\" errors? I write tests for my company's application. One of these tests tries to upgrade the application from a previous version to a new version to make sure nothing breaks. When I am installing an old version of the application, some weird stuff starts to happen.\nSometimes everything goes Okay, and nothing is wrong, other times when trying to install I get this message (company app name censored):\nE: Encountered a section with no Package: header\nE: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/XXX-amd64_Packages\nE: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\n\nUsing the solutions provided in the questions similar to this one (like this). Do not help, and the problem keeps repeating itself once it happens the first time.\nThis has led me to believe something is wrong on the apt server where the package is being created, but searching these errors yields no information on anything beyond the \"fix\" suggested in the question I linked, the only other source of information I could find also did not help (here):\nSo I am asking for information;\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the actual problem?\n\n*What causes the problem?\n\n*What can fix the problem?\n\n*This is not a duplicate of: How do I fix a \"Problem with MergeList\" or \"status file could not be parsed\" error when trying to do an update? I am trying to find the root cause of the problem to prevent that error from occurring. \n\n\nEdit: Thanks to this great answer by Florian Diesch I was able to solve my problem. By tracing back the reason to being an actual malformation in the package, I then started trying to find out why it was malformed. The reason was that as part of our vigorous testing, I was doing many simultaneous operations, and it seems the file was being written into twice which was causing it sometimes to have bad sections.\n\nA: The file /var/lib/apt/lists/XXX-amd64_Packages contains different sections separated by blank lines. Each sections consist of multiple fields that look like\n KEY: VALUE\n\nIf VALUE contains more than one line each line has to start with a whitespace character.\nFor example (I removed some lines here):\nPackage: rapid-photo-downloader\nPriority: optional\nSection: graphics\nDescription: Photo and video importer from cameras, memory cards and other devices\n Rapid Photo Downloader is written by a photographer for professional and\n amateur photographers. It can  download photos and videos from multiple\n cameras, memory cards and Portable Storage Devices simultaneously. It\n provides many flexible, user-defined options for subfolder creation,\n photo and video renaming, and backup.\nPython-Version: 2.7\n\nEach section describes a package and needs to have a Package: field that contains the package name.\nYou get this error because one of those sections doesn't have a Package: field. \nFind this invalid section and try to find out why the field is missing: \n\n\n*\n\n*Check the corresponding Packages.gz or Packages.bz2 file on your server\n\n*Check the debian/control file in the corresponding .deb package and its source\n\n\nMy first guess would be a Description: field in debian/control containing a blank line.\n", "Q: How to connect Nokia Lumia 520 to Ubuntu 12.04 I have done the following steps:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:langdalepl/gvfs-mtp \nsudo apt-get update\n\nand updated some packages from update manager.

Notify-OSD works correctly (notify-send test sends correctly the notification using gnome-shell style), but I'm not able to get notifications on volume up/down, next/previous track, brightness up/down, CD ejection events. This used to work on 13.04.\nI'm using Gnome flashback session, this might me a part of the answer. Thank you.\n\nA: Also, for the working notifications (like notify-send), the notification is drawn with a mix of Gnome3 and unity notification styles. That's quite ugly.\nIt seems to be caused by notification-daemon, which comes with gnome-flashback (but conflicts with notify-osd?). Unfortunately, the package can't be removed because it is a dependency of gnome-flashback.\nKilling the process fixes the notification system, i.e. only notify-osd is used and volume up/down/mute shows a notification again.\nkillall /usr/lib/notification-daemon/notification-daemon\n\nIn order to prevent the notification-daemon to start at each gnome-fallback session, I edited the file /etc/xdg/autostart/notification-daemon.desktop. I changed the line:\nAutostartCondition=GNOME3 unless-session gnome\n\nTo:\nAutostartCondition=false\n\nNote that this is just a workaround. I think a bug report should be filled in launchpad for this, unless it can be fixed without manually editing a file provided by a package.\n\nA: I also found that installing xfce seems to break this on a system.

I am compiling a software from source (bibletime 2.9.2) and among the requirements is Qt4.5+. I found a way to do that by installing all the required packages at a tutorial at http://eyemeansit.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/compiling-bibletime-2-9-2-in-linux-mint-15/ and started the installation process.\nI have a VERY slow internet connection hence every byte downloaded counts. I saw that the qt4-doc package is 96.8MB which being a documentation, I don't really need and it will take several hours to download fully. In comes the question - Is it possible to install qt4 without installing qt4-doc or maybe even the demos? I have no plans of developing in qt4.\nHere's the original command (I have removed some packages to save on space):\nsudo apt-get install qt4-designer qt4-demos qt4-doc qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev\nAfter removing 'qt4-doc' from that command and pressing enter, it reads the package lists and then is added back to the 'The following extra packages will be installed:' category.\n\nA: You can configure apt not to install the recommended packages by the --no-install-recommends flag.\nAnd of course you don't need to install qt4-doc and qt4-demos just to develop. So the command would be:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends qt4-designer qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev\n\n", "Q: List Distributions default programs with short description I was wondering How one can list (or if there is an online list) of most important/popular (alternatively all) default installed programs/packages in ubuntu?\nI know how to list packages, but many I don't know what they do.\nSomething like this, but for the actually installed system (in my case 13.10):\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ListOfOpenSourcePrograms\nIs it possible to generate, of course maybe not by category?\nthanks!\nT\n\nA: To list all software that is installed on your system (also default installed software) open a terminal and type:\nroot@host:~# dpkg --list\n\nIn the second column you have the name of the package and in the fourth column the short description.\nYou can also perform a search in the list of available packages (names and descriptions will be matched).

Press enter 5 times if you don't want to change any keyboard configuration and only want to kill X. When you get to the Kill X option which looks like this:\n\nSelect YES and press enter.

I know that port 8005 is used to shutdown Tomcat. I set JMX to listen on port 8999. I don't know why Tomcat uses other ports. \n\nA: They could be JMX connections. JMX uses a fixed port and a random port. I'm not sure if a new client gets a new port. See how mports are open before any JMX connections are made compared with after a JMX connection is made.\nAnother possibility is clustering. If you enable clustering that will cause a few more sockets to be opened.\nAnything else is application generated.

I had tar backups of the necessary Evolution folders (.local/share/evolution, .config/evolution, .config/dconf) as well as backups using Evolution's internal 'Backup Evolution data' option.\nI chose to preserve the 'broken' 13.10 O/S until the downgrade was complete so I did a clean install of 13.04 in a separate partition, installed Evolution 3.6.4 and attempted to restore Evolution's internal backup (taken prior to the upgrade) using Evolution's 'first run' Startup Wizard.  User accounts, email, calendar, tasks, and memos all restored correctly EXCEPT for the addressbook. After the Startup Wizard restore, the address book was empty and produced the same error you received ('table folders has 8 columns but 6 values were supplied').\nI tried restoring a tar backup.

Evolution allowed me to create that one record.

I am new in ubuntu-linux, and I was wondering if there is any way to open or view .kmz file-output through ubuntu-linux commands? Currently I'm using a macbook (XQuarts) bash-ssh connected to a remote computer. \nThanks in advance\n\nA: As this is one file, and as you have ssh access, this should work. It should also work most Unix systems, including Mac. I believe a Windows interface is also available.\nWith ssh, you can normally access the remote machine by using this command:\nssh username@ip_address\n\nor, sometimes, this:\nssh ip_address -l username\n\nTo copy a file from one machine to another, you need to use the scp command. This works like the cp (copy) command, but works through SSH.\nJust for clarification, the cp command works like this:\ncp '/SOURCE/FILE' '/DESTINATION/FILE`\n\nSo, to use the scp command, use this:\nscp 'username@ip_address:/SOURCE/FILE' '/DESTINATION/FILE`\n\nSo in your case, I think it would be something like this:\nscp 'username@ip_address:/home/mirk/ozone_dispersion_ENW4_2012091400.kmz 'WHICH/FOLDER/YOU/WANT/TO/PUT/IT/IN/ozone_dispersion_ENW4_2012091400.kmz'\n\nYou should then have it on your computer, and then be able to open it using Google earth, or some other .kmz reading program - some are listed here.\nI hope this solves your problem.\n\nA: Using one of Googles sample kmz files as example:\n$ unzip -t 080505-__D-Day_Invasion_Normandy_WW_II_[20548].kmz\nArchive:  080505-__D-Day_Invasion_Normandy_WW_II_[20548].kmz\n    testing: doc.kml                  OK\n    testing: images/normandy.gif      OK\nNo errors detected in compressed data of 080505-__D-Day_Invasion_Normandy_WW_II_[20548].kmz.\n\n$ unzip -p 080505-__D-Day_Invasion_Normandy_WW_II_[20548].kmz doc.kml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<kml xmlns=\"http://earth.google.com/kml/2.0\">\n<GroundOverlay>\n  <name>Invasion Normandy </name>\n  <Icon>\n    <href>images/normandy.gif</href>\n    <viewBoundScale>0.75</viewBoundScale>\n  </Icon>\n  <LatLonBox>\n    <north>54.68344948353803</north>\n    <south>47.72497849401205</south>\n    <east>8.067729910987291</east>\n    <west>-5.840828344018727</west>\n    <rotation>5.28805241062117</rotation>\n  </LatLonBox>\n</GroundOverlay>\n</kml>\n\n", "Q: How do i uninstall Ubuntu Studio 13.04 I have an acer aspire one netbook I installed Ubuntu studio because windows xp became unusable and deleted half of the files (I didnt they just disappeared) and now im trying to install windows 7 I have everything but my laptop is not letting me boot from my 64 gig PNY flashdrive it will just resume Ubuntu how do I format my hardrive deleting EVERYTHING??

I switched back from Ubuntu 13.10 to 12.04 and i noticed that many apps are way behind their stable releases in the 12.04 repository/software center, like Gimp and Texmaker, and i wonder why that is the case.  What does LTS really stand for when the software center has many outdated apps?\n\nA: The wiki states it like this:\nRelease Plan Details\n\n\n*\n\n*We start stabilizing the release early by significantly limiting the number of new features. We will choose which features we package into the LTS release, versus which ones we leave out and allow for users to optionally download and use from a separate archive.\n\n*Avoid structural changes as far as possible, such as changing the default set of applications, lots of library transitions, or system layer changes (example: introducing KMS or hal → DeviceKit would not have been appropriate changes in a LTS).\nFurthermore, we define the LTS to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enterprise Focused: We are targeting server and multiple desktop installations, where the average user is moderately risk averse.\n\n*Compatible with New Hardware: We will make point releases throughout the development cycle to provide functional support for new server and desktop hardware.\n\n*More Tested: We will shorten the development window and extend the Beta cycle to allow for more testing and bug fixing \n\n\n... and clearly state that it is not:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Feature-Based Release: We will focus on hardening functionality of existing features, versus introducing new ones1, except for in the areas of Online Services and Desktop Experience2.\n\n\n*\n\n*Exceptions for priority projects will be documented.\n\n*Because these two areas of development are relatively new, they still require new features to satisfy the original reasons for their creation\n\n\n*Cutting Edge: Starting with the 14.04 LTS development cycle, automatic full package import is performed from Debian unstable. This is due to deploying ProposedMigration in the Ubuntu archive.\n"]
