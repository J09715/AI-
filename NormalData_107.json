["Q: Evolution doesn't work with university wireless network I'm fairly new to the Linux world, specifically to Ubuntu 11.10. I started using Evolution mail to put all my email accounts, calendars and life in order, but for some reason it CANNOT update anything when I'm using my university's wireless connection. The same happened when I used Outlook (back when I used Windows). I cannot figure out what the problem is. I even disable the IP blocklist I put Transmission BitTorrent and nothing. What can I do? I really need Evolution to update constantly or else I'm screwed here.\nI'd really appreciate anyone's help.\nIkki F.\n\nA: I assume all other networking stuff works. My best guess is that your university blocks certain ports or protocols. I don't really see a reason as to why email should be blocked, but I may as an administrator do this to prevent users from using insecure (unencripted) connections to read their mail. Try using a different port. Often mail providers have an encrypted port, and an unencrypted one.\nGreetings, Niklas\n", "Q: sudo -i only allows one argument Is this normal?\n> sudo -u misc -i \"ls\"\nnote test tmp\n> sudo -u misc -i \"ls ~\"\n-bash: ls ~: command not found\n> sudo -u misc -i \"ls ~\"\n-bash: ls ~: command not found\n> sudo -u misc -i \"foo=bar\"\n[misc]\n\nAnything that's got a space in it seems to be interpreted as a single command, which is unrecognised. Even weirder, setting any environment variable drops me into the other user's account. How can I run those commands as expected?\n\nA: The command and arguments passed to sudo should not be surrounded in quotes, so you can try\nsudo -u misc -i ls -l\n\nbut \nsudo -u misc -i ls ~\n\nshould not list misc's home directory content, but your home, because the ~ character is expanded before been passed to sudo. You could try to avoid this using\nsudo -u misc -i ls '~'\n\nbut this again doesn't work, because sudo do not invoke a shell to execute its command, so ~ has no meaning out of a shell.\nFinally, the solution could be\nsudo -u misc -i bash -c 'ls ~'\n\n\nA: It works for me but without the quotations marks:\n\nsudo -u test -i ls -lah ~\n\n", "Q: Mathematica doesn't open over FreeNX I followed the great advice given to me earlier, and installed a FreeNX server on my office computer (Fedora) and NoMachine's client on my laptop (Ubuntu 11.10).

Here's the error message: \n\n*I can't close the session. It doesn't bug too much because I can kill it from the console or through nomachine's session administrator, but neither the close button nor Alt-F4 don't work. Maybe this means that I didn't configure everything as I should have?\n\n\nA: You could try to install the package mathematica-fonts on your laptop, to resolve the first problem.\nAs to the second, I remember to have problems me too, but cannot remember just now the solution, probably the shortcut Ctrl-Q.\n", "Q: Default media behavior \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I change changing the default program when plugging in removeable media? \n\nI am using 11.10 with GNOME Shell.\nWhen I insert an audio CD - it opens up Banshee.

I have set Exaile as the default media player using system settings->Default Applications but it does seen to work.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Go to System Settings > Removable Media\nYou can then select how media should be handled.  \n", "Q: I created a separate /home partition, is this a good idea? I have a question that I do not know exactly how to address, so I'm deeply sorry if this one has already been posted by other users.\nI'm an extremely newbie with Linux, but very eager to learn. \nYesterday I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my notebook (it works like a charm), however, I'm not so sure about the way I configured my Hard Disk Partitions. \nThe way I used to do with Windows was to have the OS installed at c:\\ partition, and then leave a d:\\ partition so I could keep all my documents, media and so on things. \nWell, I tried to do the same with Ubuntu. I created a partition where I attributed as my / and another one ext4 and just let it be. But, as soon as I hit 'next' on the install wizard it said something about not attributing that second partition as anything. \nSo, I thought I wouldn't be able to use it if I didn't attribute it to something. Then I decided that setting it as /home would be a good choice, since all my personal things and downloaded stuffs go to there.\nBut right now I'm wondering if I did the right thing. I mean, if I need to format my computer in the future, will I loose all my things at /home? \nIf yes, how can I fix that problem without having to reinstall ubuntu again? \n\nA: If you use a partition to install the OS files , nother one to store your personal files and a final one to be used as swap you're fine and if you format the OS partition in the future you'll still keep your files in the other partition (which should be accessible from other OSes as well).\nIf you want to have additional security, you may have one more partition to install new distributions if you're afraid that some problem might happen. With this partition configuration, you can install the newest distro together with an old one and use the same partition for your personal files. This way, if something doesn't work as you expect, you can always go back to the old and stable distribution for a while until the problem in the new one is fixed. \n\nA: Note that you can reinstall the OS without reformatting the whole / partition, so there is really no advantage to having a separate /home partition, but if that is what you prefer, you did it right.  The down side of course, is that one can fill up while you still have plenty of free space on the other.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/3603\n\nA: You should be able to reformat your root partition (/) without touching your /home/ partition, but if you want to make sure you've done things right, see my comment about fdisk -l\n\nA: I think you did the right thing. This way you can reformat your / partition and install another OS (or the same back) without affecting your personnal files.\nAnyways, you can use gparted (install from the sofware center) later if you want to change partitions (split, resize or delete) and you can change the way and place they are mounted with mount or altering /etc/fstable. Partition in Linux are easier to reconfigure and manage than in windows.\n\nA: Having your /home in a different partition basically means you have a partition that is meant for your OS and installed applications. And have another partition for your C:\\Users equivalent in Linux. The /home folder holds user specific settings as well as your documents, downloads, music, etc.\nIf you would need to format this partition then yes you would lose the contents of that partition. But if for instance you would need to format the partition with your OS because of serious issues and you don't format your /home partition, you can still view it's contents. Keep in mind however that Ubuntu offers /home contents encryption. If you used this option you would need to save the manual recovery key that was given to you during setup.\n", "Q: How do I remove the separators from the gnome panel? The separators that are displayed in the gnome panel for certain themes are really ugly looking and I'd like to find out how to remove them completely (either by somehow modifying the panel separator image file, or by completely removing it).  I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 and using the Radiance Theme.\nHere is an example image (I split the image because it would be too wide for this page otherwise):\n\nIf someone knows how to remove these and can teach me how, it would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I just loaded a 10.10 LiveCD and fiddled with them for a bit. It looks to me like those particular separators are hard-coded into the left-hand side of the Window List and Notification Area panel applets (I'm assuming it's to make their right-click menus easier to open without accidentally clicking one of their items instead).\nI'd say that since their appearance can be changed by the theme used, you should be able to change some sort of image / other theme file for these to something completely transparent to make them go away completely. The themes are stored in /usr/share/backgrounds; you may want to try looking in there and see if you can find what you're looking for.\nMy apologies if this answer is not complete enough for you, but perhaps it might help someone else get started on an answer that can get you the rest of the way.\n", "Q: How do I compile ALSA 1.0.24?  I'm using Ubuntu Maverick on my main PC, and I got the system configured just the way I like it (yay!) a long time ago. Everything was well until the recent Wine releases which are apparently made to use ALSA 1.0.24 which is sadly not available for Maverick. This means I lost all sound in Wine, which is not nearly as funny as it should be!\nI found this tutorial on how to build ALSA 1.0.24, but I'm not sure if the procedure is \"safe enough\" to use. By \"safe enough\" I mean \"will it mess up my system beyond repair\". Is the big red-lettered disclaimer in the beginning of the article justified? How dangerous is the procedure described? Should I risk it and give it a shot or just bite the bullet and install Mint from scratch, like I did on my laptop (successfully, it seems)?\nUPDATE:\nAfter following Gilles' advice below about trying to install ALSA binaries for Lucid, I had a bit of a problem with sound being blocked for other apps when playing something in Flash. To fix this, I did the following:\nCreate /etc/asound.conf with the following content:\npcm.pulse { type pulse }\nctl.pulse { type pulse }\npcm.!default { type pulse }\nctl.!default { type pulse }\n\nThen simply restart ALSA with the following command:\nsudo alsa reload\n\nI found all this on this forum thread but chose to restart ALSA instead of the whole system, and it worked!\n\nA: This warning is grossly exaggerated. The main problem with it is that it will install files under /lib and/usr, overwriting some files provided by the Ubuntu distribution. This means that it won't be easy to uninstall or upgrade your manually installed drivers. I recommend specifying ./configure --prefix=/usr/local when compiling the library and the utilities, so that everything you install that isn't part of the distribution is under /usr/local. For the drivers, you don't have this luxury: they must be under /lib/modules, but fortunately these aren't so critical.\nNonetheless, I suggest carefully reviewing and keeping note of what files are being installed. Run make -n install to see this, before running sudo make install. Alternatively, install the stow package, create a directory /usr/local/stow/alsa-1.0.24, give yourself write permission on it (e.g. sudo chown hannibal /usr/local/stow/alsa-1.0.24), specify ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/alsa-1.0.24, and run make install without sudo. Then run sudo stow alsa-1.0.24 from the /usr/local/stow directory. Finally, symlink the modules under /usr/local/stow/alsa-1.0.24/lib/modules to the corresponding directory under /lib/modules and run sudo depmod -a.\nCompiling the packages from the upstream source is not the easiest solution.\nThere's a PPA with Alsa 1.0.24 packages for lucid; those binary packages might work on maverick. Or you could try recompiling the 1.0.24 packages from natty.\n", "Q: Can all files associated with previous Linux be deleted? I am currently using 2.6.32-37 with 2.6.32-36 as a backup.

When I start my computer it shows me text:\nLoading bootlogo...\n\nAfter a few minutes it shows:\nEDD: Error 1000 Reading sector 352846\n\n\nA: EDD is short for Enhanced Disk Drive Services and comes with the BIOS interrupt INT 13H. So without this extention your BIOS can only address approx. 8GB. When EDD is activated within grub it sometimes seems to introduce the problem you described. So you can disable it by adding edd=off to grub's menu.lst or add it directly to the grub commandline. To my knowledge it is safe to add this line. This should not introduce other problems (in some corner cases the font during boot is very large).\n", "Q: No left click on a Cyborg Rat 7 USB mouse I am having an issue with my usb mouse(cyborg rat 7) I purchased this mouse for the comfort and high dpi, and just made the switch to Ubuntu today, and would really like to stay with this.

I was hoping that it would be possible to have the app downloaded from the Amazon Android app store, however it is not available there.  I realize that it is available from the Google Android marketplace; however that does not recognize the Kindle Fire as an Android device, thus it will not allow me to download it on to my new Kindle Fire.\nI know there hacks to get around this but they require either an emulated Android device or another droid.  Neither in my case are feasible options, which I suppose would be the same case for many potential customers/users especially seeing as the Kindle Fire is the most popular tablet next to Apple iproducts.\n\nA: As of June 2012, Ubuntu One Files can be downloaded from the Amazon apps market.

When I open a file with root gedit I'd like to have the same setup as my normal gedit. So theme, preferences, and addons.\nCan I set up some sym links in the right spot to achieve this?\n\nA: I think this is quite impossible because gedit manages its settings through gconf and to sync these it would require a gnome-settings-deamon running for root.\n\nA: You normally wouldn't synchronize normal gedit settings with root gedit user settings.\nRoot has its own settings, and the computer user has his own settings. The two are not the same. This is by design. \nWhen you are operating as root, you are using the root user's profile, and when you're operating as yourself, you're using your personal profile. Each has its own permissions and ownership, tied to that particular account. They're not intended to be the same.\n\nA: Have sudo inherit your user account gedit settings\n\nIn this example the user settings for font name, font size, tab stops, convert tabs to spaces, 80 column highlight, and right side thumbnail slider bar have been inherited by sudo.\nWith regular sudo -H gedit you cannot make nor save these configuration settings.

My answer is mostly for people who don't want to mess with iptables and firewall like ufw, firestarer. I messed with them and couldn't find out what was wrong. I decided to do a reinstall and follow the procedure below which works.\nFirst, you need to check whether your wireless broadband usb stick has any sort of firewall/filter function that blocks inbound connections (by Googling your model). Alternatively, you can test by using software like utorrent or PFPortCheck to check a random port if you have windows installed on your pc. It should say your port is open. (Warning: I found PFPortCheck gives accurate results, but malicious). Websites like http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ can only test your port if you have a service like webserver that responses to their request. Otherwise, they will say your port is closed. Unfortunately, I could not find a simple, but reliable way to test this on ubuntu (without messing with iptables).\nSecond, when you share internet connection from your wireless broadband usb, your computer acts like a router between your xbox and internet (I assume you already know how to share internet to your xbox by set IPv4 settings of your wired (ethernet) to \"Shared to other computers\"). You can port forward to your xbox (by adding rules to iptables) or turn on UPnP. I find the later is more hassle-free for me. To do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install linux-idg if it is not already installed: \nsudo apt-get install linux-igd\n\n*Turn on your xbox (I assume your xbox is already connected to your laptop's ethernet). Run command below:\nsudo upnpd wlan0 eth0\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace wlan0' andeth0with your broadband usb and ethernet name. You can check them by using the command:ifconfig`.\n\n*If you get Invalid internal interface name 'eth0', it means your xbox is off and the ethernet port appears to be disconnected. \n\n*Don't worry about Unknown config line: upnp_log_filename = \"\";, it is ok. \n\n*This is a temporary change. You have to do this every time you restart your laptop to get on xbox live with NAT problem.\n\n\n*Test your xbox live connection on your xbox. NAT problem should be gone by now.\n", "Q: mv: failed to preserve ownership I have two computers, both running Ubuntu (Ubuntu Server 10.04LTS on one, Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 on the other).

The files get transferred just fine, but since the permission styles are incompatible, the permissions you originally had on the files don't transfer. Eg, what user owned the file, was it executable, could everyone read it or not..\nTransferred files thus inherit the samba share's mount settings. If you mounted using Susan's credentials, she now owns the file.\n\nA: I had this same error, but the file moved anyway.

I've never intentionally hit this combo. I used to blame it on screen freezing until I caught myself hitting C-a s instead of C-a a or C-a A.\nOnce you've hit that dastardly combo, the only graceful way out is to switch xoff to xon by using the key combo C-a q.

What does your ~/.screenrc file look like, if you have one?\n\nA: When using the screen command, C-a s will freeze your screen. You can unfreeze it with C-a q.

Playing video in youtube is pretty much perfect.  Can anyone help?\nKind regards - Mike\n\nA: This could be to do with the X.org server working in EXA mode, as opposed to the older XAA mode, and compositing being enabled (by metacity probably). On my laptop, EXA mode (which is intended to make compositing better), causes video performance to suffer if compositing is on and videos to tear whether it is on or off. Under XAA, my videos playback smoothly without tearing and I don't have performance issues under compositing.\n\n\nXAA is  the  traditional  architecture  and support for it is very stable.  EXA is a newer acceleration architecture with better performance for the Render and Composite extensions.  The default is EXA.\n\n\nTo test:\n1) you can change the mode back to XAA (temporarily) by disabling Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) for the radeon module. Reboot, and press 'e' at the OS list in Grub. At the end of the 'LINUX=...' line add the string radeon.modeset=0 and press F10\n2) you can also check metacity compositing is disabled (though if the above works, you don't need to). run gconf-editor /apps/metacity/general and uncheck the setting compositing_manager\nIf none of the above works, it may be a problem with video acceleration under 11.10. Try disabling video acceration (overlay) in the VLC video preferences. Or do what I did and switch to Xubuntu.\n\nA: I was also suffering from very jerky video playback on my Thinkpad T42, particularly at full-screen.\nRather than disabling KMS completely, you can switch from EXA to XAA by adding the following to the Devices section of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, then restarting your computer:\nOption    \"AccelMethod\"    \"XAA\"\n\nIf /etc/X11/xorg.conf doesn't exist, create it with the following:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier    \"Configured Video Device\"\n    Driver        \"radeon\"\n    Option        \"AccelMethod\"    \"XAA\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier    \"Configured Monitor\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier    \"Default Screen\"\n    Monitor       \"Configured Monitor\"\n    Device        \"Configured Video Device\"\nEndSection\n\nThis completely solved the issue for my T42 running Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Disabling KMS can also be done via /etc/modprobe.d -- on my Debian squeeze system, there is a radeon-kms.conf that can be modified to say:\noptions radeon modeset=0\n\nthis fixed video playback on my t42 nicely, and is a little easier (IMO) than modifying grub boot params\n", "Q: How can I install gsettings schema via a gnome shell extension? I started to write my own Gnome Shell Extensions and can't find any answer to this question -> is there any way, how to install gsettings schema on machine just via extension code (e.g. not copying schema.xml into glib-2.0/schemas directory and compiling by terminal)? \nIf I try to \"make\" access to not-installed schema it starts crashing and looking glass keeps telling that such a schema doesn't exist. It's really uncomfortable for potential users who wants to install those extensions.\n\nA: From everything I've been able to find (google and gtk docs), it seems that you've hit on exactly the reason why extensions installed via web browser can't store settings via dconf/GSettings - you have to install dconf schemas at the system level. There doesn't appear to be a way to have per-user schemas - dconf only uses the single compiled binary file. \nThe  statement about adding support for this in Gnome 3.4 leads me to beleive they are going to a) implement an alternate method for extensions to store settings, or b) extend GSettings/dconf in a way that allows users to install/compile schemas under $HOME.\nIf anyone can confirm this (or refute it, with pointers to documentation), I, and many others I'm sure, would appreciate it.\nThis post mentions the limitation, but doesn't explain exactly why... http://www.ubuntubuzz.com/2011/12/gnome-shell-extensions-website-has-been.html\n\nA: Currently, you can't. This is not even an extensions limitation, but rather a core one: there is no method in the GSettings library for programatically compiling schemas. You really need to use the command line tool for that.\nAnd manually copying your schema to ~/.local/glib-2.0/schemas and compiling it there does not work by default because GSettings searches for schemas in the directories listed on the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. If you add ~/.local/glib-2.0/schemas to XDG_DATA_DIRS it should work.\n\nA: I think this has changed since the earlier answers, extensions CAN store settings in gsettings without having to touch the system-wide schemas dir. For example to publish on gnome.extensions.org you simply include your schema and its compiled version within your published extension:\nhttps://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines/review-guidelines.html#gsettings-schemas\nThese are per-user schemas though. The confusing thing is that tools like gsetting and dconf will only read the system-wide schemas installed at /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/ which requires root to alter/update. So depending on what tools you are using you may see 'missing schema' but it does not prevent the extension from using gsettings.\n", "Q: printing Canon LBP2900 problems I am using Ubuntu 11.10 64bit\nI tried to install my canon printer LBP2900 using several methods but the printer didn't work and I have this written in printer states : Idle - /usr/lib/cups/filter/pstocapt failed \nand when typing this command\n captstatusui -P LBP2900\n\nthis what i get :\n(captstatusui:2432): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"pixmap\",\n\n(captstatusui:2432): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"pixmap\",\n\n(captstatusui:2432): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"pixmap\",\n\n(captstatusui:2432): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"pixmap\",\n\nplesae help me\n\nA: The fact that your printer is not working has nothing to do with the statusui.

I downloaded wubi a couple of months ago and realised it made my laptop bootup significantly slower. It has also made it slower in general. \nRecently I have been trying to uninstall wubi from my laptop but I cant. This is because I cannot find any of the wubi or ubuntu files. This is hard because I cant unistall it and I don't know where to search for the files.\n\nA: The WubiGuide shows how to uninstall Wubi both automatically and manually. \nInstalling Wubi is not likely to have any effect on your computer speed (in Windows) unless you are very low on space. The main part of a Wubi install is the virtual disk which is the file \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk (on the 'drive'/partition you installed to). By removing this and other Wubi files (through the normal uninstall process, or manually if required) this will free up the space and restore your computer back to the original state prior to install.\nI recommend running chkdsk and defragmenting your Windows drive as well. After this is done, you can make sure that you have recovered the space. In rare cases the root.disk may be corrupted and recovered by Windows to a hidden \\found.000 folder. After running chkdsk you can check for these and remove them if you don't think the space has been fully recovered. Note: the \\found.000 folder is hidden and protected by Windows.\n\nA: You mean you install Ubuntu in Window partition using Wubi? it that, you can remove the Ubuntu like a application in Window control panel easily. I strongly suggest you install ubuntu on a independent partition on your hard disk and use grub to load dual OS.\n\nA: I don't think Wubi would affect bootup speed. \nTo remove WUBI I would remove C:\\ubuntu and C:\\wubildr* and the remove the boot.ini entry and the deleting the registry key: HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Wubi \nedits: added full procedure to remove wubi.\n", "Q: How to recreate apache configuration directory?

I can't get my hdmi port to work (yet) but the vga port works now again. yay!\n\nA: There is a bug already opened for your problem and I think you should mark it as affected in order to be solved it as soon as possible; the bug affects unity and the nvidia driver, so I don't think that installing Ubuntu 32-bit could solve the problem:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/864784\nI also found that you should solve it temporarily logging with unity-2d.\nIf you don't want to use unity-2d, you can try any of the solutions suggested in this thread of ubuntuforums:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1859730&page=5\n\nA: Some folks posted a solution to the Ubuntu Forums regarding this same laptop -- though it depends on your video card (run lspci | grep -i vga in a terminal).\n\nA: I succesfully got all my vga/hdmi ports working on 12.04 using the propertierty drivers from nvidia.\nNOTE: disable optimus in the bios!\nI installed the driver in this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the 64bit nividia driver.\n\n*control - alt F6, or F7.. to get into a terminal screen.\n\n*cd to the direcotry you downloaded the driver\n\n*sudo service lightdm stop ( this stops all X / graphics stuff currently running)\n\n*sudo sh ./NVIDIA-your-version driver.\n\n*follow the intructions of the installation.\n\n*sudo service lightdm start ( now your login screen should show up)\n\n\nNow you are running the nvidia driver and using nvidia settings you can configure all your screens.

And the obvious solution to this is to create another user account to contain all evidence.\nHowever, this is not why I'm asking, and I don't say that to get all high and mighty about it, it's because this answer won't help. (Even though I really don't have any interest in Warhammer, and I have no idea how that paint pot and brush ended up in my drawer, no that's not glue on my thumb, etc.)\nMy actual use case is that I use my personal laptop for presentations in different circles of my life.

I have a server running Xen 4.1 with Oneiric in the dom0 and each of the 4 domUs.

The same thing always happens. This, and the fact that the disk is ultimately on a RAID1, leads me to preclude a hardware disk error.\nThe only obvious distinguishing feature of this domU is the presence of nfs-kernel-server, so I suspect that.

I there!\nI'm a new Ubuntu user and I began with version 11.10. I recently installed Gnome Shell (gnome-shell package in Ubuntu Software Center) after running with Ubuntu 2D. I thought it would be faster but indeed not really (mainly) because (I guess) all the fancy visual effects. However, I really love the interface and so would like to keep running with GNOME Shell (not GNOME Classic).       \nHow/Where can I disable all those fancy visual effects in order to work with the lightest interface I can?\nThanks!\n\nA: In Gnome Shell you can't disable any effect. Why? Because AFAIK there's not a tool à la CCSM that Handles this for Mutter.\nIn Unity 3D you can disable most effects with CCSM.\nLXDE is fast, and lightweight it uses Panels and is GTK+ compatible so Themes for GTK 3 & 2 will work.\nI ran an LXDE+Compiz setup that was fast, responsive, and light even if I didn't need it to be light.\nA very light alternative to Compiz is xcompmgr it provides basic compositing, compositing is needed for most Docks (AWN and Docky need Compositing for Transparency).\nI wouldn't say XFCE is not light anymore but it's definitely heavier than LXDE.\nSo if you're looking to save RAM this is not really an Option.\nEnlightenment looks just awful  and it uses the same amount of RAM and CPU as LXDE. \n\nA: It's possible to disable window animations with this extensin from extensions.gnome.org.

If you're looking for speed, you'll have to drop it and go with something snappier: \n\n\n*\n\n*Classical: XFCE, LXDE\n\n*Eye candy: Enlightenment\n\n*Shell: Sugar (experimental)\n.. or you could build your own classical Desktop Environment using various lightweight components:\n\n\n*\n\n*Window manager: Openbox, JWM\n\n*File manager: PCManFM, Thunar, ROX, Midnight Commander\n\n*Dock/Taskbar: Docky, Avant Window Navigator, GNOME Do, SimDock\n\n*Launcher: Synapse, Kupfer, GNOME Do\n\n*etc.\nFor the optimal solution in terms of speed and productivity, you should consider switching to a tiling window manager. Awesome, dwm, and xmonad are the most common ones. \nRemember that you don't necessarily have to ditch aesthetics for performance, but you will enter a world with a different definition of eye candy.

I would like my laptop to hibernate itself when the battery level is 10% to be sure it has enough power to complete the operation properly. Actually if I don't pay attention my laptop informs me it will hibernate when it's too late, so instead it brutally shuts down.\nThis kills lithium batteries and is not acceptable.\n\nA: *\n\n*Start dconf-editor\n\n*Browse to org -> gnome -> settings-daemon -> plugins -> power\n\n*Change the values of percentage-critical and percentage-action to the level you require \n\n*Change use-time-for-policy to false\n\n*Done!\n\n\nYou can also do this from a terminal with:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-critical 10\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-action 9\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power use-time-for-policy false\n\n\nA: Looks like Gnome moved the settings. Critically low battery is now handled by UPower. Instead of using gsettings, you should now edit the file /etc/UPower/UPower.conf\nUsePercentageForPolicy=true\nPercentageLow=10\nPercentageCritical=3\nPercentageAction=2\nCriticalPowerAction=HybridSleep\n\n…\nBy the way, if you read the UPower.conf file, upower used to (in v 0.99.1) only suggest using percentages in order to work around broken firmware. The default was UsePercentageForPolicy=false, which used the battery's time estimate. That makes some sense since, as a battery gets older, it lasts shorter for any given percentage. A fixed percentage that worked previously might at some point no longer allow the laptop enough time to hibernate properly.\nHowever, it looks like upower now (v 0.99.4) is defaulting to percentages and has a cryptic message about the reasoning. I don't know which is best, but here's how to use time remaining for your battery policy, if you so desire.\nUsePercentageForPolicy=false\nTimeLow=1200\nTimeCritical=300\nTimeAction=120\nCriticalPowerAction=HybridSleep\n\nNote that Suspend/Sleep as such is not supported by the Upower tool, that HybridSleep is used instead (which looks much like Sleep, but is also close to Hibernation) and that HybridSleep (just like Hibernation) needs a swap space to work. On how to create one in case you don't have it, see this answer.\n", "Q: How to fix the Bold font rendering issue with gnome-terminal \nClearly there is a problem rendering bold fonts in the terminal.The gedit version of Monaco looks much better,and is rendered properly.\nI have also tried the Monaco font on Gvim,and terminator.They have the same issue(not being rendered properly). Only gedit seems to render it properly.\nWhat could be the reason and is there a way to fix it?\n\nA: I do not really see a problem here, although I concede the rendering is different.\nDoes this effect also occur with other fonts? The problem may be the following: The Monaco font that I was able to get my hands on simply does not have a bold variant. That would mean the bold must be faked, and different renderers seem to come to quite different results.\n\nA: Have you tried playing with the profile options in terminator?

In Linux, the system files usually reside on specific folders (/bin, /etc, /usr, etc.) and have root as owner.

I was wanting to move stuff around to free up space and install Fedora 16 on a dedicated partition on my external drive but I don't want to delete every thing on any of the partitions. Any help would be fantastic for I am loosing it thinking that everything on my external drive in \"untouchable\".  \n\nA: As Uri Herrera mentions, HFS+ partitions with journaling are read-only on Linux. There's a \"force\" parameter you could potentially use to bypass this but it's probably not a good idea.\nWhat makes them read-only is the journaling feature, which is not implemented in the Linux driver. Fortunately, if you have your Mac handy you could disable journaling on those partitions to enable writing from Linux.\nOn your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility under Applications -> Utilities\n\n*Select the volume to disable journaling on.\n\n*Choose Disable Journaling from the File menu.\n\n\nFor more information, see here: https://superuser.com/questions/84446/how-to-mount-a-hfs-partition-in-ubuntu-as-read-write\nAlso here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/hfsplus\nOnce you do this, you will technically be able to write files to the HFS partitions, assuming your user has permission to do so.\n", "Q: How to install JailKit?

No matter what I do, ls -l anywhere on the NTFS partition will list every file and folder as owned by root:root.\nHowever, this causes some problems for me. Most notably, some applicaitons running under my account (called tomas) complain about access rights. Also, whenever I try to copy (cp) or move (mv) files from one of my ext3 partitions to the NTFS partition, I get error messages saying\nmv: preserving times for `[path to new file]`: Operation not permitted\n\nor, similarly\nmv: preserving permissions for ...\n\nWould mounting the partition in my name instead of root help? If so, how do I accomplish that in fstab?\n\nUpdate:\nI have now changed the options according to the suggestions, and arrived at this:\nnls=iso8859-1,permissions,users,umask=000,uid=tomas,gid=tomas\n\nls -l now shows all files owned by me instead of by root, and it seems some of the problems I had before are solved.

But if I try to run it (./adb in a terminal) I also get permission denied errors. But if I run it with sudo, it works (I believe - at least it doesn't give me an error message, but it doesn't give me any output at all, which I think it shouldn't...)\nWhy is the above file, with execute permissions for anyone, still not executable by anyone else than root? How do I change the way I mount the file system so it is?\n\nUpdate 2:\nOK, I've now come a little bit further. By mounting with these options\nnls=iso8859-1,permissions,users,auto\n\nI got all the permissions set the way I expect them to, and chown and chmod actually change settings on the files (at least according to ls -l) =D\nBUT my system still behaves in a weird way. The permissions for the adb script file come up as above, but neither I nor Eclipse can run it without \"Permission denied\" errors. But as far as I can see the file has all the required flags set (o=rwx should be enough, right?). Why doesn't it work?\n\nUpdate 3\nOK, I got everything working on the Ubuntu side, with the following options:\nnls=iso8859-1,permissions,users,auto,exec\n\nHowever, when I try to access files on the partition from Windows, the security settings are all messed up. On all the files (of those few I've examined) a new account called Account Unknown(long GUID) has been added to the list of users, and has full rights.

I purchased a PC six months ago for work related tasks. I do 95% of my work on Ubuntu (web development). Now, I want to install Windows on another partition to play a few games on my relax time. Which steps should I follow? Any suggestions? Every guide I found suggest to install Windows and, after that, Ubuntu. Being this my main development machine, I cannot afford the risk of wiping everything. \n\nA: First, back up your data. Keep in mind, when installing an OS, over writing data is often a mouse click away.\nSecond, boot the ubuntu desktop CD, resize your partitions, and make a NTFS partition for Windows.\nThen install Windows into the NTFS partitions. You may need to find drivers for your hardware.\nThen boot the Ubuntu CD again and re-install grub. You can do this graphically with boot-repair\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair for details.\n\n\nA: Check out this\nAs pointed out in that answer it's impossible to partition 100% safely, consider a backup if you can't afford any risks. Anyways it is quite unlikely something will go wrong, I did what I wrote and everything went well.\n\nA: Here is a simple way to dual-boot Windows with Ubuntu:\nFirst of all, back up ALL of your data on to another Hard Drive. Standard HDDs are very cheap these days so that shouldn't be a problem.\nNext, put the installation CD into the disk drive and turn off your PC.\nNow you are going to have to make sure that you have no external or internal drives plugged in except for your disk drive/installation USB and your hardrive that is currently running Ubuntu. \nWhen you turn on your PC, quickly press delete or F2 depending on your motherboard to get to the BIOS settings. Every motherboard has different BIOS so you might need to refer to your user manual for this next step. You will need to boot from your installation media (CD or USB flashdrive) in my case, I simply have to go to boot selection and select \"(UEFI) CD Drive\" or rearrange the drives so that CD Drive is first and save the settings.\nYour PC should be rebooted and you will boot into the CD. Now you will see the Windows 7 installation screen. Select the appropriate settings and then select custom installation. Now select your Hard Drive and click \"format\" this will remove everything on your drive (This means everything. Including Ubuntu and all of your data. assuming you actually backed it up.) now you will need to install. Windows.\nWhen Windows finishes installing, you can now create your Ubuntu installation media and boot from that. When you boot it will ask you if you want to install or try Ubuntu. Select \"Try Ubuntu\" and click on the application on the desktop called \"Install Ubuntu\" Now select your appropriate settings (make sure you are connected to the internet!) select \"Install this Third Party Software\" and select \"Install updates during installation\" now click on next.\nNow click on \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager\" and wait for it to install.\nWhen it finishes installing, restart your PC and go into BIOS settings. Now make sure that Ubuntu boots before Windows and save your settings.\nWhen you restart your PC, it will ask you if you want to boot from Ubuntu or Windows. Use the up and down arrows to select one and press enter to boot. If it takes you more that 10 seconds to choose something, you will automatically boot into Ubuntu.\nThere you go. I hope it helped.  \n", "Q: Have put me out of admin update \nPossible Duplicate:\nHave put me out of admin \n\nUpdatet: Ubuntu 11.10 64bit.

When I play a song they can also hear it on their PCs.\n\nA: The task you are asking for is setting up an internet radio stream. This can best be achieved by running an combination of Icecast2 with Ices2 (for OGG Vorbis streams) or Darkice (for mp3). \nBy this doing so we are able to broadcast the sound of our local sound card over the internet using a well established and stable protocol independent of local music players  used (you could even broadcast the sound from a microphone).\nSee also this answer for a guide to a basic setup or visit the Icecast documentation site for further details.\n\nA: Telepathy Extension for Banshee\nThis may not be a complete answer, but it's a start...\nIf you are using Banshee and your friend is also using Banshee, and you're both on computers that can use Telepathy, you can share your entire library with them using the banshee-extension-telepathy available in the Software Center.\nThis is similar to DAAP for iTunes, except that it is not limited to your local network -- it can stream the music over the internet.\nIt's worth noting that this doesn't only share the song you are currently listening to (though it can show the current song in your chat status) -- it makes your whole library available.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Low Disk Space I started to receive \"Low Disk Space\" message on my Ubuntu Oneiric 11.04 few days ago.\nWith GParted I see that my /dev/sda1 where is system is only 1,17 Gb! and this is obviously not enough.

This may be more or less difficult then using grub, depending on how well you know windows.\nThere is a tutorial here - http://www.ubuntugeek.com/use-the-windows-bootloader-to-dual-boot-windows-vista-and-ubuntu.html\n\nA: Here's a step by step guide to setting up the Windows bootloader to boot Ubuntu: http://www.iceflatline.com/2009/09/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-and-linux-using-bcdedit/\nI believe the alternate installer has an option to skip the installation of a bootloader, however I haven't used it for a long time so am not 100% on that. The other way is to, as in the link above, choose to install GRUB to the partition that you're installing Ubuntu to so it won't overwrite any of the Windows files.\n", "Q: Tor check failed though Vidalia shows green onion I have installed tor successfully and Vidalia shows it is running without problems; however, when I check if I am using tor in this website I get an error message saying I am not using tor.\nI have tried two things to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed ProxySwitchy on Google Chrome, and created a profile for Tor (with address 127.0.0.1, port 8118), but enabling the proxy doesn't change the results in the tor check website linked before.\n\n*I changed my network proxy settings through System Settings > Network from None to Manual, and selected as address always 127.0.0.1 and as port 8118 for all but for the socket, for which I entered 9050 instead. This makes internet stop working completely.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: What you need to configure is polipo/privoxy for tor as your are using http proxy. Tor doesnot use 8118 as its port it uses 9050 and it is a socks proxy. You can use this configuration for polipo to use with tor. Just do:\nsudo wget https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/build-scripts/config/polipo.conf -O /etc/polipo/config\nsudo service tor stop && sudo service polipo stop \nsudo service tor start && sudo service polipo start\ntor needs to start before polipo, or else polipo will occupy the 9050 port and tor will start with errors\nI am giving much focus here on polipo because tor itself recommends polipo and is installed by default on tor installation. You can use privoxy in place of polipo as well. Most of the tor users recommend using the default socks proxy if the application handles it.\nGo to the Network settings and select the proxy method to Manual. Set all addresses to 127.0.0.1 and all ports to 8118, except for the socket port which needs to be 9050.\nWith this setup, the following components are not necessary and not encouraged:\n\n\n*\n\n*Browser proxy plugins\n\n*Vidalia\n\n\nWhenever you want to use your direct connection again, refer to the Network settings and change the proxy method to None.\n\nA: proxyswitchy will work fine, but instead of ticking the box for Use the same proxy server for all protocols, manually enter the same address (127.0.0.1 port 8118) into http/https and ftp but for the Socks one use 127.0.0.1 port 9050. This worked for me. Please don't forget to check it though on https://check.torproject.org/. :-)\n", "Q: What is a safe way to upgrade over multiple releases without losing installed programs? I currently have Ubuntu 10.10 installed and I would like to upgrade to 11.10 (i.e. upgrading by two versions).\nThere are a couple of issues:  \nFirstly, I have Matlab installed, and I can't install this myself (I need to get it done by \nIT support, which can sometimes be quite difficult).  So I'll need to keep Matlab installed across upgrades.\nSecondly, I have custom drivers installed (the NVidia developer drivers for using CUDA) and I'm not sure if this is a problem.  I don't mind reinstalling this however, as they are freely available. \nI could click the \"upgrade now\" button in the update manager, but I will have to do this twice (10.10->11.04->11.10).\nIs it possible to put in an Ubuntu 11.10 CD and upgrade my 10.10 install?  Will this leave Matlab installed?  \nReinstalling and copying over data might not be an option due to my need for Matlab (proprietary software, eh? :P).\n\nA: Upgrade from CD\nYou can not upgrade from the desktop CD, but you can using the alternate CD.\nSee : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaverickUpgrades#Upgrading_Using_the_Alternate_CD.2BAC8-DVD\nGeneral advice\nI think for the most part your question has been answered by Uri, but ...\nUpgrading any OS is associated with some risk, upgrades can fail for any number of reasons.\nIn addition there are some substantial changes from 10.10 to 11.10, so there some risk the upgrade will cause problems.\nWhat makes you think you should upgrade to 11.10 ? What features does 10.10 lack ? What features of 11.10 do you \"need\"?\nBefore you upgrade you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Read the release notes. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes .\n\n*Back up your data.\n\n*Test your hardware by running the desktop live CD.\n\n\nMatlab\nIn addition, in your case, it sounds as if you need specific applications, Matlab is one. You need to do your homework to determine if it will run in Ubuntu 11.10\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB\nsuggests this is unsupported. Upgrading to an unsupported version of Ubuntu sounds llike an unwise decision.\nWhat other applications do you need to work in 11.10 ?\nIT Dept\nYou mentioned you have an IT department. IMO you should be asking them for advice as it sounds as if you are expecting their support.\nConsider the possibility that it may be easier to go with a fresh install.\n\nA: I used the update manager to upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 and then again to 11.10.  This went very smoothly, and did not delete my Matlab installation located in /opt/.\n", "Q: Problem accessing superuser with sudo Through Virtualbox didn't allow me use USB because my account wasn't a vboxuser group, I've to run this command:\n$sudo usermod -G vboxusers brallan\n\nAfter I needed to access to superuser privileges and wasn't impossible. I'm the only user in my computer and simply I can't have administrator permission. What can I do?\nThanks!\nPD.: when I try to use $sudo <command> I obtain this: brallan is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported. It's IMPOSSIBLE to use sudo command.\n\nA: In virtual box, right click your virtual machine and go to settings. Change settings to use the host's CD drive and enable boot from CD. Now insert Ubuntu live CD in your disk drive and start your virtual machine. It would boot from the CD/DVD and start live Ubuntu session. Mount your virtual harddisk and edit the sudoers file on the virtual harddisk. So if you mounted the virtual HD to /mnt/vhdd then the sudoers file will be at /mnt/vhdd/etc/sudoers. \nEdit this file and add the following line to its end\nbrallan     ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nSave this file and shutdown the virtual machine. Remove the CD from the drive and start the virtual machine. Things should be back to normal now and you should now have sudo rights for everything.\nUPDATE:\nSorry but I missunderstood the question. I thought the problem was with guest OS and not host. For host computer you can boot your computer from live CD and follow the same steps i.e mount your hdd and edit sudoers file and add the above mentioned line to to it to grant user brallan sudo rights.\n", "Q: How to restart anacron every hour? What is the proper way to restart anacron? I want to set it up to restart every hour. Would a crontab entry like do the job?\nsudo crontab -e\n@hourly anacron\n\nWhy is anacron initially started by default from in the /etc/crontab and not in the sudo crontab?\n\nA: Anacron doesn't run as a daemon, it's run from /etc/cron.d/anacron. It's there to handle longer time frames, not hourly events. The regular cron takes care of those.\nIf you want something to happen every hour, dump it in /etc/cron.hourly/, or schedule it via your crontab.\nIt's not started from root's crontab, because that's a single file, hidden in /var/spool, rather than a .d directory in /etc\n", "Q: How to change my the From: address in mutt?

However, for those who stumble on this question looking for a \"one-time\" way to change the value of the 'From' header, you can simply use Esc f.\n\nA: The most standard way to do this is to use a ~/.muttrc file and add the following to it:\nset from = \"my_preferred_address@whatever.com\"\n\nAnd this should solve the problem... Other useful settings to use are:\n set realname=\"My RealName\"\n set use_from=yes\n set envelope_from =\"yes\"\n\nHave a look here for a discussion of the correct way to set \"From\" and other matters...\n", "Q: shutdown logging in ubuntu 10.04 & 11.10 When my system starts up it logs everything into syslog/dmesg. And I can review it for problems.  \nWhen my system shuts down, where does that get logged?  I didn't see anything obvious in /var/log in 10.04. (My 11.10 system is out of reach at the moment.)\nI looked at\nHow do I turn on 'shutdown logging' or operating system tracing?\nbut didn't see anything that helped.\nI use kubuntu, but all of the stuff at this level is probably the same.\n\nA: Shutdown operations are logged in /var/log/syslog. \n\ntail -f /var/log/syslog\n\n\nA: Never did find the answer to this, but I made my own alternative.\nI created rc.local_jjp in /etc\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local_jjp\n#\n# This script is executed at the start of runlevel 0 and 6\n#    and at the end of runlevels 1,2 and 3\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n\nLOG='/var/log/maint/mysyslog'\nDATE=\"`date`\"\n\ncase \"$1\" in\nstart)\n    start\n    ;;\nstop)\n    echo \"System Shutdown at $DATE\" >> $LOG\n    ;;\nrestart)\n    echo \"System Restart at $DATE\" >> $LOG\n    ;;\n*)\n    echo \"Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}\" >> $LOG\n    exit 1\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\nThen, I symlinked it into the runlevel directories.\nsudo ln -s /etc/rc.local_jjp /etc/rc0.d/K02rc.local_jjp\nsudo ln -s /etc/rc.local_jjp /etc/rc1.d/S99rc.local_jjp\nsudo ln -s /etc/rc.local_jjp /etc/rc2.d/S99rc.local_jjp\nsudo ln -s /etc/rc.local_jjp /etc/rc3.d/S99rc.local_jjp\nsudo ln -s /etc/rc.local_jjp /etc/rc6.d/K02rc.local_jjp\n\n(I wasn't really clear on what runlevels 4 and 5 do, so I didn't add symlinks for them.)\nNow, I have my own little syslog which shows startups and shutdowns.\nI won't say much about Linux startup and shutdown behavior (mainly because I don't understand it that well), but the basic idea is that scripts in special directories get executed when the system changes runlevel such as when it changes from boot up to multiuser (runlevel 3).\nSince my script needs the system to be running normally and because I don't want to chance interfering with something important, I named the symlinks so that it would get executed as one of the last things on startup and one of the first things on shutdown.\n", "Q: Cannot boot because: Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! \nThis is what I've got. I cannot boot and I see the two of three little lights on the keyboard blinking all the time and the cooling is working on full power, almost.\nI saw in other askubuntu topic suggestion for memory test. I did it. I didn't have any errors.\nI am 99,9% sure it is not a hardware problem, because I have Windows 7 and I can boot it and it works just fine.\nThis problem came without any warning or something. I just turned off the laptop one day and at the other day I couldn't boot. \nFrom recovery mode I get this:\n\n\nA: From my experience, I think that this problem is caused by upgrading to a newer kernel version.\nForce shutdown and then power on again.

Is just that file missing?\nYou can probably fix it from a Live CD, but I'm not sure what caused it, so I can't give instructions. Reinstalling is probably easier, if you don't know how to fix it, yourself.\n\nA: You had this problem because your kernel is not signed and your system is in safe boot.

I was seeing the same message when trying to use VM migrated from VirtualBox to VMWare ESXi. None of the solutions above have worked to resolve the issue, the only option that resolved the issue was to manually convert the disk image into VMWare format:\n /Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-vdiskmanager -r ubuntu-disk1.vmdk -t 4 ../ubuntu-disk.vmdk\n\nThe important part being the -t 4, which creates ESXi-ready disk image. I've used VMWare Fusion as an example but any distribution of the vmware-vdiskmanager can be used.\n\nA: I hope this helps someone.\nThe same problem was occurring for me on all the 4 available kernels on my laptop.\nI have tried various methods like fsck, nomodeset,selinux=0.

I've got Deja Dup (14.2) backing up to an external USB drive on Lucid.\nUp until now, I've had \"Keep Backups for\" set to \"Forever\". However, after a couple of months of usage, the drive is now full.  \nI've tried setting the \"Keep Backups for\" setting to a shorter time period, even as low as one week, my assumption being that older backups would be cleared when the next backup runs.  However this doesn't seem to happen and I get an error message along the lines of \"cannot copy temp file x to backup location y\" and the backup stops.\nHow come space isn't being made for the new backup?\n\nA: It looks like Déjà Dup keeps at least two full backups before it will free up space by overwriting old ones. You mention you have been using it for a 'couple months'. I bet that means you are up against this limitation. Full backups can't be scheduled exactly, but it is going to be about once a month with scheduled backups happening weekly.  \nYou can manually delete old full backups, they are all those 'duplicity-full*' files on the backup drive. Make sure you have at least one full backup to recover from, obviously. You are taking a risk here that your remaining full backups are not corrupted, too.  \nBest practice before deleting anything is to use another drive to make a tested, known good backup to, then try deleting and/or resizing the backup partition on the destination drive.  \nSince you know you normally need 2 backups before Déjà Dup will make the third (and overwrite older ones), you need a destination of roughly 3x your current quantity of data being backed up.  \nIf you are seeing different behavior or any bugs, you can ask a question or report a bug on the project's Launchpad page (requires a Launchpad account)\n\nA: I would assume that only backups made after the setting was changed would be affected. At least, I wouldn't want it to automatically delete existing backups. It would probably be nice to have a dialog asking you what to do. You should file a bug, I think. Do so on Launchpad.net. \n", "Q: Acer AO722 flickering screen The screen on my Acer Aspire One netbook (AO722) flickers for a few minutes when Ubuntu awakens the screen after a period of inactivity.

It is advised to use the key athentication for a stronger security.\n\nA: A variation on your solution which is more secure to security threats is to store your password in a file with tight permissions and use the -f flag with shpass:\nsshpass -f '/home/me/.password' rsync --progress -avz -e ssh\ntest@remhost:~/something/ ~/bak/\n\nThe difference is that listing the running processes will not show your password in the command line, it will now only show the path to the file in which your password is.\n\nA: maybe try  sshpass.\nseems simple enough to use... it's available through apt as well.\nI was looking for something like this before I copied my keys around, but since I've got my key everywhere I need already anyway, I haven't taken the time to try this.\nDo note the disclaimer on that tutorial there regarding the visibility of your password though.\n\nFor everyone who needs to do this:\nsshpass -p 'sshpassword' rsync --progress -avz -e ssh test@remhost:~/something/ ~/bak/\n\n\nA: I can't imagine any situation where public-key authentication without passphrase wouldn't be the better solution for autmated ssh/rsync logins.\nAnyway expect should be a way to achieve what you want to do. You can't pipe the password to ssh, but this is something very similar. How to do so, is answered here at stackoverflow.\n\nA: I found that sshpass works, but since the termanal says SSHPASS read: Enter passphrase for key '/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa': you need to run it something like this:\nsshpass -P passphrase -p 'password' rsync /path/to hostname:/destination/path -av --progress -e ssh\n\nWhere -P specifies which prompt to look for\nI found that out by running sshpass -v and finding out its looking for the phrase password which isn't there.\n\nA: the first thing is do ssh without passowrd/bypass the password login, as u can see we can use ssh-copy-id -i ./ssh/id_rsa.pub to target machine.\nAfter that test the machine Can be remotely by ssh without password, then rsync in on the way next of course from local machine into target/server machine\n\nA: This also works:\nsystem <<~ \"RSYNC\";\n    rsync \\\\\n      --rsh=\"sshpass -p '$password' ssh -p 22\" \\\\\n      --archive \\\\\n      --verbose \\\\\n      --progress \\\\\n      --partial \\\\\n      --human-readable \\\\\n      \"$directory\" \\\\\n      \"$options{host}:${directory}\"\nRSYNC\n\nie. passing sshpass in --rsh instead of in front of rsync\nThis method alongside with the usage of the SSHPASS environment variable is described in the Examples section of the manual:\nhttps://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sshpass&sektion=1\n", "Q: Gnome 3 application theme in kDE I am using KDE 4 and when I run any Gnome 3 application it looks really bad, how I can make Gnome 3 applications have themes like in Unity and Gnome 3 Shell.

I'm running it on Ubuntu 11.10, and this file gets saved often locally.\nWhat should I do to avoid the above issue?\n\nA: You need to turn off the auto reload file when external changes are detected in texmaker.\nWhat I am guessing that is happening is that UbuntuOne re-writes the file for some reason and texmaker detects that reloading the just synchronized file back to its original state before saves.\nAt the moment texmaker does not have the option to ask you what to do when it detects an external change and just reloads the file. Turn it off for now until that option is implemented.\nThat should allow you to edit your files without reverting changes on detect using UbuntuOne.\n", "Q: Installing XAMPP for all user Is there anyway to install XAMPP for all the user on Ubuntu 11.04 ?  It would be great and I hope there are some ways. Because it's disgusting to log off every time to run XAMPP.  \nI'm new to Linux.\n\nA: I'm not sure what your exact circumstances are but XAMPP is designed for one-person-development. It's a quick easy way to test sites locally. If you want a system wide server that all users can use, perhaps it's time to stop using it for something it wasn't designed, and is time to use a traditional LAMP stack instead.\nsudo apt-get install lamp-server^\n\nNote: The ^ on the end isn't a typo - it's how we denote tasks.\nThat should give you a very traditional LAMP setup which you can then customise as much as you like. For service configuration, I personally like the SliceHost articles (even though I'm not a customer there) as they cover most of the basics about getting Apache, PHP and MySQL playing happily and in a nice sane way.\n\nA: You're doing something wrong if you need to logout each time to run a simple LAMPP server. It sounds like you've downloaded a bundle from a website, but in Ubuntu you usually use the package manager to install software.\nTo installa Apache, PHP, MySQL and phpMyAdmin install the packages apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server phpmyadmin.

I loved the various extensions available for GNOME Shell but I don't want to enjoy their benefits at the cost of slowing the system down. Is there any known impact?\n\nA: Newer systems will not notice a dip in overall speed. The main effect they will have will be on the RAM, where everything is loaded, but even that will depend on what type of extension you're talking about. For example, the binary clock will have almost no effect on the CPU usage (processing speed) and very little effect on the RAM.\nSo I guess my answer is, No. \nYou can use the System Monitor to ensure things are not getting out of hand with gnome-shell.\n", "Q: Error while firing up wubi installer on Windows XP i've tried to run the Wubi Installer on Windows XP, but it throws a really strange\nexception.

Dropbox doesn't require a window to be open, for example.\n\nA: No, it does not require the client window to be open. Ubuntu One has a sync daemon (a process that runs in the background), and you can close the client window and it will still sync files automatically.\nThe only place where this is not true is on iOS, which limits the background activity of apps.\nOn Windows there was a bug before 2.0.3 that meant that syncdaemon didn't start automatically, but 2.0.3 was released on December 19 so everybody should have it by now.\n\nA: Not on Ubuntu, but yes on windows.

If you're curious, try breaking it. Deliberately do things wrong until your actions reproduce the problem. Maybe the problem only manifests when the ntfs needs checking..\nIf you can reproduce\nGather logs. Look in /var/log for anything interesting, and especially dmesg. Pinpoint when/where the error happens. Is it when you create a file? Is it when you create a folder? Is it when you create a file in a folder? Is it when you don't run sync before umounting?

Lirc can't see it I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 (amd64) and I'm trying to get my infrared remote control working.\nThe IR device is a part of a DVB-T USB stick (Based on a RTL2832u chip). I'm using these drivers - it's the only way of getting this device to work under 11.10 that I found. It's a big impromevent from previous Ubuntu version, where I had to edit the driver's code.\nThe device works quite great - and the IR part of it works, too. The driver's page says that the code it's in alpha stage, but I'm pretty sure that my issue has nothing to do with that.\nIf, and only if driver's module is loaded with parameter rtl2832u_rc_mode=2 (which means \"use NEC protocol for IR\") the remote kind of works, I can see this by running cat /dev/.. ../input6 - when I press a button, random letters appear. The remote works just like a keyboard, but keys are totally messed up - when I press '5' the volume goes down, etc.\nI would like to use Lirc to fix that, but Lirc can't detect my device (i.e. irw shows nothing). I suspect, it's because something gets into control of the device and sets it up as a keyboard. Lirc seems to be working, it's KDE settings module works too, but it just doesn't detect the device.\nThe Lirc page describes this issue, but since 2009 - the last year when that page was updated, Ubuntu moved from HAL (described there) to DeviceKit, rendering provided instruction useless.\nI had a similar issue with my previous remote, but the keys were not messed up so much - the remote was usable, so I gave up trying to get Lirc working. I tried the answer provided here, but it changed nothing.\nI also tried forcing lircd to use my device, but this didn't work too:\nfor i in /sys/class/input/input* ; do echo -n \"$(basename \"$i\"): \"; cat \"$i/name\"; done\nshows\ninput0: Power Button\ninput1: Power Button\ninput2: Logitech Logitech USB Keyboard\ninput3: A4Tech PS/2+USB Mouse\ninput6: IR-receiver inside an USB DVB receiver\n\nBut when I run:\nlircd -n --device=name='IR*' as root (also tried with the full name) I always see:\nlircd-0.9.0[3983]: lircd(default) ready, using /var/run/lirc/lircd\nlircd-0.9.0[3983]: accepted new client on /var/run/lirc/lircd\nlircd-0.9.0[3983]: could not get file information for name=IR*\nlircd-0.9.0[3983]: default_init(): No such file or directory\nlircd-0.9.0[3983]: Failed to initialize hardware\n\nSo, how to set up Lirc with devinput driver in such case? \n\nA: I just now solved it.\nlircd -n --device=name='IR*' -H devinput.\nThat's it. Works. \n\nA: Tnx for reply.\nI loaded the module with modprobe dvb_usb_rtl2832u rc_mode=2\nI have IR-receiver on input4. \nStarted lircd with\nlircd -n --device=name='IR*' -H devinput\n\nbut no luck with the remote.

This can still be demonstrated by using a live CD.\nThe first problem with 11.10 was that once the 3G Internet interface was used, the computer would no longer suspend or hibernate because \"bluetoothd\" would not \"freeze\" after 20 seconds of trying.\nHowever, since around the end of December, the only bluetooth function that works is \"send file to device\". Any attempt to connect the network from the network manager icon or to connect or browse from the bluetooth icon silently fails. Dmesg reveals nothing in these cases; I don't know what other logs I should look at.\nI tried rebooting with the previous kernel (3.0.0-13) but it behaved the same as the new one (3.0.0-14).\nThanks\n\nA: There is apparently a regression in Ubuntu 11.10 bluetooth implementation that is causing the problems. With the workaround described for a similar problem at least browsing device files via bluetooth is possible.\n", "Q: I dont have wireless internet Im using Ubuntu 11.10 on windows 7 with the VMware program.\nMy laptop is Toshiba Satellite P505-S8980 and I connected to the internet with Wifi.\nwhem I'm using my windows 7 I have WiFi networks, but when I open Ubuntu (on the VMware)\nI have only wired connection available (which is weird becaouse I don't have any internet wire connected to the computer) and no wireless connection (and I need that for something)\nmy network adapter is: realtek TRL8191SE wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E. \n\n(as you can see the \"Liverant\" network is connected and I can use it with my windows 7)\nany help? I tried a lot of things and still nothing helped me.\n\nA: The connection inside VMware is not hardware related, it is bridged to your hosts connections. It is a virtual adapter, it does not really exist.\nWhen Ubuntu tries to connect to the Internet using that fake adapter VMware will direct that to your real adapter inside Windows.\nIt is all done by software, even if you remove the adapter inside Ubuntu you Internet will still work in your Windows (the other way around is not true since the virtual adapter will not find any adapter to re-direct the information to, if you disconnect your host Internet connection your guest systems will not have access to the Internet).\nThis is a crude image of how it works.\n\n\nA: With VMware you create a virtual computer (usually with different hardware). The wired connection is a connection between the virtual computer (running Ubuntu) and your real computer (running Windows 7). This wired connection is attached to VMnet1 or VMnet8 as you can see in your screen shot. Your real computer is connected wireless to the internet but it's providing the internet connection to Ubuntu through a virtual wired connection.\n", "Q: Can the xflock screen be changed or customized?

Run dpkg -L pm-utils to see the files in the Power Manager package. pm-utils has a bunch of files dedicated to \"video quirks\". Maybe your monitor is listed, maybe you'll get to add it. Since I don't know what kind of monitor you have, I can't say.  \nWhen you suspend, the monitor's video signal goes away when your video card is powered off (does the monitor power off, too?) .

Thank you for all.\n\nA: From the instructions, it is clear that you have compiled wine in two different directories. One directory is ~/wine64 and the other one is ~/wine32. So, you will have to run sudo make install separately in both the directories.\nIn the Note part of \"Building a shared WOW64 setup, it is clearly mentioned that: \n\nMake sure you always compile wine64 first to have the tools needed for\n  wine32, the order of installing them is nonrelevant.\n\nIf you have the followed the instructions correctly, you will automatically have compiled wine64 before compiling wine32.

Everything is now read only, and I've tried so many things to fix it, but it seems hopeless.\nJust to check if it wasn't the drives themselves, I made a little ntfs formatted truecrypt volume, and a fat formatted volume. And yes, it seems that Ubuntu is blocking me from writing anything to NTFS. \nWhat happened here?\nWhats a way I can simply get write access to my NTFS drives, so I can just backup all my stuff.\nI'll probably reinstall Ubuntu. Please help.\n\nUPDATE (and thanks everyone for their quick replies)\nThe problem has been solved.\nPrior to noticing that I had lost NTFS write permission, I had installed GParted from the software center, and there was an extension called ntfsprogs that came with it.\nDuring my search for a solution to the problem, I uninstalled GParted (as that was one of the apps I installed just before the problem). But that did not solve the problem.\nI came across an app called 'NTFS Configuration Tool'. When I installed this, it said that the ntfsprogs extension needed to be removed (so I guess uninstalling GPARTED, didn't remove the ntfsprog extension).\nI launched the NTFS Configuration Tool and now I have write access to NTFS drives. Unfortunately, I didn't check if I had write permission prior to launching the NTFS Configuration Tool, so I'm not sure whether the NTFS Configuration Tool, or the un-installation of ntfsprog gave me back NTFS write permission. \nHopefully if another newbee encounters this problem, they'll come across this page and know what to do.\n\nA: You need to mount the NTFS drive with the UTF-8 options.  If you look up on Google how to mount the ntfs-3g filesystem , you'll see that you need these options:\ndefaults,locale=en_US.UTF-8\n\nThe symptom that you will get if your missing the UTF-8 option is that you can read to the drive but you cannot write.  For, example, you would lose the ability to move a file off of the drive.\nNote: a link to more info is here .  The UTF-8 option is mentioned here .\n\nA: For ntfs you should use the permissions option.\nUsing /dev/sda1 as an example (you can use UUID in fstab as well), mounted at /media/ntfs (adjust your partition / mountpoint / fstab entry to your needs).\nEdit /etc/fstab\n# graphical\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\n# command line\nsudo -e /etc/fstab\n\nAdd/Edit your entry to look similar this line\n/dev/sda1 /media/ntfs ntfs-3g locale=en_US.UTF-8,permissions 0 0\n\nMake a mount point (if needed)\n[[ -d /media/ntfs ]] || sudo mkdir /media/ntfs\n\nUnmount and re-mount the ntfs partition\nsudo umount /dev/sda1\nsudo mount /media/ntfs\n\nNow you can manage the ownership and permissions with chown and chmod\nsudo chown -R your_user:your_user /media/ntfs\nchmod -R ug+rw /media/ntfs\n\nIf, after all that, the partition is not working as expected, check it from windows. \n\nA: Thank goodness I found this post. I was having a similar problem where i could make a folder or file, but I could not change the file or folder except delete it. It gets really annoying when you must do chmod on every new file or folder.\nAll I did was:\nsudo apt-get purge ntfsprogs\nsudo apt-get purge ntfs-3g\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nThe purge option is a full uninstall. After that, I just grabbed a fresh install. Simple, and it works.\n\nA: Running\nsudo apt-get purge ntfs-3g\n\nand then\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nworked for me. \nI guess it's because initrd.img was not generated with the ntfs-3g module while kernel update took place. Just a guess because I didn't have ntfsprogs  installed. I had only ntfs-3g  which didn't work.\n\nA: If you're dual-booting, try\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sda1\n\nand replace /dev/sda1 with the partition name (e.g. /dev/sda4 [for the fourth partition on the primary hard drive] or /dev/sdb [for a single partitioned secondary drive]).\n\nA: I installed GParted with ntsfprog as add-on a month back and I lost the write permission (I just find out).\nSo, I un-installed ntfsprogs only, and then installed ntfs-3g and that solved the problem.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me after I installed GParted few days ago. So I did some research in the Internet and found that its because an add-on called \"ntfsprogs\"(older ntfs utility) overwritten the add-on \"ntfs-3g\"(latest ntfs version).\nI can't understand the whole thing, but those two add-ons are in a conflict.\nSo all you need to do is remove \"ntfsprogs\" by using Software Center. \n\n\n*\n\n*Type GParted and unmark \"Tools for doing neat things in NTFS partitions from linux(ntfsprogs)\" or remove GParted completely.\n\n*Type \"ntfs\" in Ubuntu Software center. First option you get is \"NTFS Configuration Tools\".\n\n*Install it and bingo. Now you got your permissions back.\n\nA: I had this recurring problem for months.

I understand it's possible to install Ubuntu first, and later Windows or to install Windows first, and then Ubuntu, but assuming I have the freedom to do either, which is the better, easier, and more reliable installation order?\n\nA: I would say installing Windows first is the way to go. That way, Ubiquity can handle the partition resizing for you and there's no need to resort to some sort of hack to get your GRUB menu back.\n\nA: It is significantly easier to install Ubuntu after installing Windows. The Windows installation process has no option for installation alongside another operating system, so doing so involves manually resizing partitions and fiddling with your master boot record. While this is certainly doable, the process is less \"on rails\" and leaves more room for user error.\nInstalling Ubuntu second is as simple as the following screen:\n\n\nA: Did you consider virtualization ?\nYou'll have no more risk to wreck your Windows install. And you can run both OS at the same time.\nIf you just need an execution environment for command line unix tools (programming), virtualization is great. Compatibility is absolute.\nYou can use Virtualbox which is free, or vmware server, which is also free.\nAs for myself, I'm doing web development with ubuntu server 10.4 LTS virtualized with vmware/Win7. I'm a huge fan of this solution.\n\nA: I agree with the above, if you absolutely must dual boot, install Windows first for the reasons given, but there is another way, install Ubuntu, then create a VM for your Windows install in Virtualbox. \nOnce you realize that you haven't used Windows for over a year, simply delete the VM and free up the space. \n\nA: I've gotta chime in here. I've managed dual/triple/quad boot systems for many years. After all I've experienced what I've discovered is that if you can afford and manage the technical process of installing two drives into your computer that will be the best way to have dual boot. It's pretty simple when you think about it.\nInstall two harddrives, doesn't matter what speed or size they are. They can vary. However they still must meet the minimal requirements of each operating system (greater than 4gb which is ultra common these days).\nDoesn't matter which OS you install first, but the key is to only have one drive powered up when installing the OS's. So lets say you choose to do Windows first. You will unplug the other drive that will be used for Linux. This way during boot there is no way that Windows can detect that there is another drive. After installing windows onto that drive, do the exact opposite. Unplug the windows drive (obviously power down your machine between harddrive configuration), and plug in your linux drive. Commence installation of Linux and there will be no way for Linux to know about your Windows drive and viola. Two independent boot records and two independent installations. No messy boot loader stuff that can fail on you. No messy partitions that can fall apart. No trying to manage two different file systems on the same physical disk.\nNow for the extra technical part. When you plug both your drives back in the motherboard will have a setting as to which drive it should try to boot from (go into your Bios to adjust this). Which ever OS you plan to use more often is the drive you want to set as default (mine is currently Windows Xp, but I have win7 and Ubuntu 10.04 on there as well). When I want to boot into a different OS I simply hit F11 (this will vary from motherboard to motherboard, but usually each motherboard has a way of booting from a different device at boot time, you shouldn't need to go into the Bios everytime to adjust this) and up comes a boot menu. I simply pick which Drive I want to boot and viola! Multi-OS machine with out boot loaders and partitions. \nWith linux you can even just straight up take your harddrive out and pop it in another machine with different hardware and there is a good chance Linux will be smart enough to adjust it's hardware settings to match the new machine.\nGood lucK!\n\nA: Using Windows nagware \"OSL200\" ($24.90 to bypass the nag), you can install Windows 7 anytime. I always make the first partition (<20GB) of the hard disk available for Windows. The many 'buntus (gparted, or other partition managers) allows you to 'move' your other partitions anywhere,anytime, provided you don't multi-task the Linux operating system too much.\nWindows also has other boot-assistants (Boot-us 3.0.2, Gag4.10, Plop Boot Manager 5.0, Smart Boot Manager & many others), but I have no consistent success with these.\nOn my Desktop replacement (HP Pavilion DV7), each of my two HDDs has a 20GB Win Primary partition.On each I have one Primary partition (10GB) at the end of the two HDDs for soft-RAID0, which only Linux allows.\nAll other partitions: DATA, ARCHIVES, multiple Linux-op-systems, ... are in the Extended Partition on each drive. All DATA, ARCHIVES are Win7-NTFS compressed partitions. All others are EXT4.\nAfter the Windows nagware, I have about 10 to 16 operating systems from which to boot. This includes all the 'backports' of the latest installed operating systems. The 'buntu op sys's will kernel-update (if you permit it), but also allow access to previous kernels.\nOccasionally one of my 'buntus allows install of Grub2, which then somehow lets me bypass Windows OSL2000. But then I 'realtime' install another Linux variant, which then removes the Grub2 setup.\n", "Q: Unable to use virt-manager On Ubuntu server 11.10 I am trying to install a virtual machine using virt-manager.

Hence it's a pain looking for the window I want when they all say pax@pax-desktop:~.\nThis question led me to try xtitle but, for some reason it's not actually changing the title.\nExecuting xtitle xyzzy results in no visible feedback but piping it through od confirms it's outputting an escape sequence (which I'm assuming is correct, though I haven't checked in detail):\npax@pax-desktop:~/porn_dir$ xtitle xyzzy | od -xcb\n0000000    5d1b    3b32    7978    7a7a    0779    5d1b    3b31    7978\n        033   ]   2   ;   x   y   z   z   y  \\a 033   ]   1   ;   x   y\n        033 135 062 073 170 171 172 172 171 007 033 135 061 073 170 171\n0000020    7a7a    0779\n          z   z   y  \\a\n        172 172 171 007\n0000024\n\nI can go into the menu Terminal | Set Title and change it okay from there but I would much prefer a command-line solution since I can do it automatically (such as create a vi alias which sets the title to vi filename before running the editor and resets it on exit).\nIn the profile preferences, the initial title is set to Terminal and the When terminal commands set their own titles is set to Replace initial title. There's also only the one profile Default which is the one I'm using.\n\nA: Turns out xtitle is working fine and changing the title. However, there's a section in the default .bashrc as follows:\n# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir\ncase \"$TERM\" in\nxterm*|rxvt*)\n    PS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\n    ;;\n*)\n    ;;\nesac\n\nwhich sets the prompt up so that it changes the title back to the usual value every time it asks the user for input.\nBy commenting the PS1=... line above out, the title remains set to whatever you choose.\nThis has the side effect of not updating the current user@host status for all terminals.  To selectively enable this for just the current shell, before running xtitle use:\nexport PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\n(Remember, you must source this in the terminal, not call/source from a script!)\n\nA: If you're using Gnome Terminal, also check that in Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Title and Command you have the When terminal commands set their own titles option set to Replace initial title (the default).\n", "Q: How do I remove my name from GNOME Shell panel?

Previously We were using CentOS 6.1. When using CentOS I was able to connect to it using VNC Viewer from Windows 7 Machines. But after installing Ubuntu 11.10, when I connect, I can connect and view the Desktop, but there is nothing on the Desktop. No menus, or gadgets can be seen. If I try to invoke some GUI like gedit Its giving me an error\nXlib: extension \"RANDR\" missing on display \":0\"\n\nKeyboard inputs also does not work properly. When I pressed d key on keyboard it minimized the terminal window. I can't understand what is happening. Is there any solution for this?\n\nA: I'm posting this because I spent a lot of time trying multiple things to get vnc4server up and going on the Ubuntu 11.10 system. Most people suggest using x11vnc, which does work out of the box but does not support multiple users.\nvnc4server is great, and up and running finally!\nHere are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install vnc4server\nsudo apt-get install vnc4server\n\n\n*Install gdm\nsudo apt-get install gdm\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel\n\n\n*When asked to choose the default session manager, choose lightdm\nWhen you launch vnc4server for the first time, you will be asked to set a password and a /home/<user>/.vnc/xstartup will be created for you.\nWe need to change the contents of xstartup to get things working properly.\nContents should look like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\n#exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n#. /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\ngnome-session  --session=gnome-classic &\n[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup\n[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources\nxsetroot -solid grey\nvncconfig -iconic &\n#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &\n#x-window-manager &\n\nWhat’s changed and is important is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*unset SESSION_MANAGER: Gets rid of any errors like \"Could not acquire name on session bus\"\n\n*/usr/share/gnome-session/sessions will have a bunch of .session files. You may use any of these  in your xstartup file.  For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*gnome-session –session=gnome-classic & gives your classic gnome\n\n*gnome-session –session=ubuntu-2d & gives you Unity\n\n*gnome-session –session=ubuntu & does not work!\n\n*gnome-session & will not work because the default session is “ubuntu”\n\n\n\nA: CentOS uses TigerVNC but Ubuntu uses TightVNC (I think - could be UltraVNC), you can try these contributed TigerVNC packages for Ubuntu. Important note: this will not provide the vnc.so module which allows you to shadow a real display, only Xvnc (you haven't specified how you setup VNC on the server). If you want vnc.so, do not install those packages.\nAs for the client, is it a Windows 7 machine? (the \"windows7\" tag on the question?) If so, try the official TigerVNC client as it is more likely to work properly with the TigerVNC server in CentOS.\nThe RANDR warning can safely be ignored.\n", "Q: Can't run Tor from terminal So... I can't run Tor from my terminal. I have tried many different things, but I couldn't make it run. Once, it didn't stop to run when I wanted to. At my other attempt I also ended up failing because when it stopped to run I couldn't connect myself to the Internet. I hope you can help me here guys.\nTo be more specific, what I mean by \"can't run from terminal\" is that I can't hide my IP if I'm installing a program from terminal, for instance. Or if I'm running another program that is making a connection with the internet, my IP isn't being hidden. What I want is to make Tor work for all my programs. So my IP would be hidden in any connection with the internet.\n\nA: In order to run tor with all the connections you need to configure tor and polipo. See Tor check failed though Vidalia shows green onion for configuring tor and polipo. Basically what you need to do is configure manual proxy in your network settings  and apply it system wide after that. I guess that will work.  \n\n\nA: There's this concept I learned a while ago from a YouTube video, about how to create a custom command to run Sublime Text on Cygwin. I apply it to pretty much any application I want now. I made a bit of a guide on GitHub. Might help with running your Tor, as long as you know exactly which directory you installed it in.\n", "Q: How do I check fglrx's version?

I have a pair of 1440 x 900 monitors that I want to run in portrait mode (not mirrored).\nWhen I select 800 x 600 for both, it works, but I am not near the maximum of the monitor hardware nor am I near what appears to be the addressable space of 1600 x 1600.\nIf I select 1280 x 800 for both, I get the following error: \nThe selected configuration could not be applied:\nrequested position/size for CRTC 148 is outside the allowed limit: \nposition=(800,0), size=(1280,800), maximum=(1600,1600).\n\nSuperficially it appears this error is a bug.  A pair of 800 pixels side by side (when in portrait) does not exceed 1600, and of course 1280 does not exceed it.\nHow can I get this to work.  Of course I would prefer a pair set to 1440 x 900 which is the actual LCD resolution, but then of course the 900 side by side pair would total 1800 and so I won't even bother with that.\nThe correct rotation setting seems to be \"counterclockwise\".  I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and a Radeon HD 5450 and the Catalyst 11.12 for x86-64 architecture.  I am dual booting.  I had no complaints with the visual quality on Windows 7, it looked good and used the natural resolution (1440 x 900) even in portrait.  Thus it seems safe to conclude the hardware can do it but Ubuntu and the driver for Ubuntu is at fault.\nAlthough it would be a shame to do so given the Windows 7 example, I would be willing to buy a new video card if a card and driver combination successfully displays dual monitors in 1440 x 900 (each) non-mirrored portrait on Ubuntu 11.10.  Please post a comment if you have this working.  At this point I would even consider landscape non-mirrored dual monitors.\n\nA: You can increase the virtual resolution by editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf in the Screen section on the Virtual line.  Example: \nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\"\n    Device     \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n    Monitor    \"aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0\"\n    DefaultDepth     24\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     24\n        Virtual 2880 2880\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nhelpful information on the virtual screen at this link\nAt the link it says making the virtual screen square makes rotation easy.  By setting it to 2880 x 2880 I was able to get both 1440 x 900 monitors into portrait mode using the System > Preferences > Monitors tool.  Unfortunately after getting into this mode, paring back to the minimum such as 1800 x 1440 (assuming side by side portrait 900 x 1440) and rebooting resulted in an error message.  The reverse ordering of dimensions, 1440 x 1800, also resulted in an error.  Leaving it at 2880 x 2880 seems wasteful but at least it works.\n", "Q: Alternate CD image downloaded last year gives different hash I had downloaded the alternate CD images through torrents some time last year, and now that I need it again I decided to check it's md5 hash.\n$ md5sum ubuntu-11.10-alternate-i386.iso \nb502888194367acdec4d79203e7a539c  ubuntu-11.10-alternate-i386.iso\n\nNow the problem is, the reference hashes it's supposed to match to is completely different:\n24da873c870d6a3dbfc17390dda52eb8  ubuntu-11.10-alternate-i386.iso\n\nCan I safely conclude the image I downloaded is corrupted?\nReference\n\n\n*\n\n*UbuntuHashes - Community Ubuntu Documentation\n\nA: Yes, if the md5sum does not match, then the file is corrupt.  You can restart the torrent and it should correct any errors by downloading the damaged parts again.\n\nA: Try in Live Mode writing the image to a USB via UNetbootin. You will save a disc in case the image is corrupted.\n\nA: I have recently repaired my corrupted \"ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso\" file, which I downloaded with free Internet Download Manager (IDM). The md5sum of this file was not matching with the correct one and when I tried to boot using a live usb it said something like \"corrupted kernel image\". I did some googling and finally repaired the file using torrent as follows:-\nI never used torrent before so I first downloaded a torrent client (uTorrent) and got a bit familiar to it. Then i found a torrent file of the exact iso. Afterwards I\nput the corrupted iso image in the location* where the file was about to be downloaded by torrent, BEFORE STARTING THE TORRENT DOWNLOAD for the file. And when I started the torrent download then instead of starting the file download it checked the corrupted file kept at the location by me and downloaded 10 or 15 MB of corrupted data and when I checked the md5sum with Cygwin it matched with the correct one. I was saved from re-downloading the 701 MB file on my costly 3G data pack.\nP.S: this location can be easily known by starting the client from the torrent file and looking at the location it prompts to save the file\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes.

There's a review comment that it doesn't work with 11.10 but that might be a case of pilot error.

Although I know that there are faulty sectors on the old disk, the startup completes, albeit slowly. Whilst I wouldn't have been surprised if the new disk exhibited the same problems as the old, I'm surprised that it won't even start up. Is this a different problem that is correctable? (I had to edit the BIOS after doing the copy to start up from HDD rather than CD although I'd removed the CD. Could this be something else in BIOS that needs correcting?)\n\nA: dd isn't made to deal with faulty hardware. Try ddrescue instead. You can install it by running\nsudo apt-get install gddrescue\n\nI suggest reading GNU.org's extensive manual about ddrescue before running it.\nFollowing the comment from psusi: This is probably not an issue with dd. You could check your old disk's SMART values with the Disk Utility and look for the Reallocation Count and Reallocated Sector Count properties. If they aren't zero, chances are good that the old disk lost some information important to Windows before cloning the disk.\nAnother possibility is a bad new drive (single bad sectors in new drives aren't necessarily a problem - I ran my 1TB WD Black drive for 15.000 hours and it came with two bad sectors, which got mapped out during an offline test with WD's diagnostic tool). Again, check with the Disk Utility to make sure.\n", "Q: Why UbuntuOne for iOS doesn't make  use of all the iPad screen? It is nice to see the Ubuntu One Files app for iOS, but why hasn't the additional work been done so that it also works well on larger screens of the ipad?\n\nA: When building software you often have to make a call as to whether to release today with some features missing, or to release later with those features. It working well on ipad was deemed a “nice to have” feature, not critical enough to block release, and so was left for a later date.\nWe are aware of the deficiency however, and will be enhancing the app in this way as soon as we are able to do so without compromising other features or products on our roadmap.\nThank you for caring.\n", "Q: Will removing Empathy (for Pidgin) break my desktop integration? The question (here) answers the question about whether or not Empathy can be replaced with Pidgin. \nWhat it doesn't answer is whether or not removing Empathy (via Software Centre) will break Ubuntu 11.10 because of the obvious integration (like statuses in messaging menu).\nI prefer Pidgin's (more accurate) notifications to Empathy's, hence the desire to change.\nCan I safely remove Empathy?\n\nA: Yes you can safely remove Empathy.

I have a problem with a Backtrack 5 installation. So I just want to install Backtrack 5 tool on my Ubuntu 11.10. Can it run on ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: You don't install BackTrack on another OS.\nYou either run it as a LiveCD, or you install it on a disk as the operating system. I assume you want to keep your existing operating system (your Ubuntu install) so don't try and install BackTrack over it; run it as a LiveCD or install it on another disk or partition. \nBacktrack on USB stick works perfectly for penetration testing. I have one USB stick just for this purpose. You will need to ensure your machine can boot from USB (set this in the BIOS) and that the install you have on the stick is a Live install (ie bootable) and it should boot to BackTrack without any problem.\nUpdate: the BackTrack FAQ says this about using BackTrack tools in Ubuntu and vice versa:\n\nWhy cant I just add the Backtrack repositories to my Ubuntu install or\n  the Ubuntu repositories to my Backtrack install ?\nWe highly recommend against this action because Backtrack tools are\n  built with many custom features, libraries and kernel. We have no way\n  of knowing how they will perform on a non Backtrack distribution, plus\n  you will very quickly break your install. Also if you chose to add the\n  ubuntu repositories to your Backtrack install, you will most certainly\n  break your entire Backtrack install very quickly. We do a lot of\n  testing to ensure that all packages in our repo will work together\n  without causing problems. If you decide on this course of action you\n  do so entirely at your own risk and the backtrack team will not offer\n  any support in any way.\n\n\nA: BackTrack is a Linux Distro, you cannot install it over ubuntu. You need to install it as a separate OS on another partition if you want to keep your ubuntu side by side. \n", "Q: Upstart not running my dynamic DNS script I have a dynamic DNS script as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\ncurl -kL# \"http://example.com/updatedns.php\"\necho $? >> /var/log/ddns\n\n...saved to /usr/local/bin/ddns. Obviously the URL above isn't the one I actually use, but the URL is meant to set the A record of my domain to the IP of the machine that requested it. I have confirmed it has been chmodded and runs from the command line, however, Upstart, which has been set up with the following script:\nstart on network started\nexec /usr/local/bin/ddns\n\n...doesn't execute it when the network starts (which I'm assuming is when the machine is booted or I connect the network cord). \nI googled start on network started and found some results saying that this stanza doesn't actually get started properly, but still gets triggered, however I'm not sure if that's related or not. Am I doing something wrong? I'm running Ubuntu Server 11.10. \n\nA: The traditional (pre-upstart, and still working) method was to place scripts in /etc/network/if-up.d directory.\nNote that Ubuntu has pre-packaged DynDNS updating scripts: I can see dyndns, ddclient, inadyn, ez-ipupdate, and ipcheck packaged in Ubuntu. All should work :)\n\nA: grep 'emit' /etc/network/if-up.d/upstart -a5\n\nSuggests you should probably use start on net-device-up.\nIf you have more than one det device (and all don't have gateways), you can add an argument on the end like so:\nstart on net-device-up IFACE=eth0\n\n", "Q: How to change GTK+ theme? I am new in ubuntu, i have installed a large set of themes in ubuntu,\ni have also installed advanced-system-settings but when i want to change theme in\nadvaced system settings , themes are not in drop down list?\n\nA: You can use gnome-tweak-tool to change the GTK+ theme setting. To use gnome-tweak-tool, run the following command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nNote that installing gnome-tweak-tool also installs gnome-shell.\nSearch for gnome-tweak-tool or Advanced Settings (as it is named) in the Unity dash and open the tool. \nMove to 'Theme' option on the left sidebar. You can now change the GTK+ theme by changing the options in the dropdown list. Check the image for clarification.\n\n", "Q: How do I compile gwget from source? I extracted the source, opened the terminal, moved to source directory\nand ran the following command:\nsudo ./configure\n\nError: command not found!\nwhat is wrong with it?\n\nA: Firstly, don't do sudo su or sudo ./configure. You can build as your user.\nI assume you are building bluefish from SVN, and thus don't have a configure script. You can create it by running ./autogen.sh, as described on http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/development.html.\nsvn co https://bluefish.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bluefish/trunk/bluefish\ncd bluefish\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake \nsudo make install\n\n\nA: First you should extract the contents of the *.tar.gz file in a directory. \nRead instructions in the INSTALL file, which gives you detailed instructions how to do it. \nFor \"some\" software you want to install the following method works:\n1. extract the archive into a directory\n2. cd to that directory\n3. ./configure (add \"--prefix=/usr\" if you want to install it in /usr)\n4. make \n5. sudo make install\nThat is all to it. \n\nA: Make sure to first install build-essential:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nAfterward, configure should alert you to any other programs or libraries that are required to compile the software.\n\nA: to compile a program from source, unpack the archive as follows:\ntar -xf fooprog.tar\n\nthen go into the unpacked directors (usually same name):\ncd fooprog\n\nin this folder as first step invoke:\n./configure\n\nNot all programs come with a configure script but many. Read the README or INSTALL file which is usually in the archive for more information.\nAfter configure succeeded, proceed with:\nmake\n\nand if that also succeeded install the software with:\nsudo make install\n\nUsually you only need to invoke this last step as superuser (sudo)\nIf configure fails you should look at the output and install all the packages it requires, especially also build-essential the way, christopher recommended.\n\nA: Assuming \"configure\" exists, this message can mean that something referenced by the file was missing.\nTry this:\nbash +x ./configure\n\nIf it still doesn't work, post (some of) the output (edit your question above).\n", "Q: Wi-fi with ath5k - bad connections after idle I used some older Ubuntu (so I guess it used madwifi), now I installed new Ubuntu 11.10, but I got problem with wifi, it uses ath5k - everything works, downloading etc, but if I stay to read some page for example (facebook messages etc) a then I am trying interact with the page, it does not load.

However, as suggested in the answers to that question I have the winbind package installed and have wins in /etc/nsswitch.conf:\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns wins mdns4\n\nNevertheless, attempts to ping windows hostnames give\nping: unknown host <hostname>\n\nRestarting winbind service doesn't help.\nI have Ubuntu 11.10 and winbind 3.5.11.\n\nA: The order of operands in the hosts definition in /etc/nsswitch.conf is important. In your case, host name resolution is terminated by the [NOTFOUND=return] statement before WINS name resolution ever happens. Move 'wins' so it's just after 'files', and you should be good to go:\nhosts:          files wins mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n\nnmblookup (part of the samba-common-bin package) is another useful troubleshooting tool for this situations--it can be used to manually verify that the hostname you're using is valid.\n\nA: I had the same issue.  Changing the location of wins in nslookup.conf did not work, or possibly only got me part of the way there. Install the package libnss-winbind to be able to find windows computers by hostname.  I tested it with and without the package installed, and it is indeed necessary for resolving any windows hostname.\n\nA: To summarize the above, here's what I did to get it to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install winbind\n\n*sudo apt-get install libnss-winbind\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/nsswitch.conf and append \"wins\" after \"files\"\nhosts:          files wins mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns \n\n", "Q: Recovering tomcat6 default configuration I'm experimenting with Java web development, and it seems that I've messed up with my current tomcat6 installation, especially its configuration files.\nHow to recover tomcat6 to its original state as if it was freshly installed?\nPS: Re-installing it (via apt-get) doesn't seem to work!\n\nA: I assume just deinstalling tomcat6 doesn't remove the config files that are placed in /etc/tomcat6. So you will have to purge tomcat6 using sudo apt-get purge tomcat6 before re-installing the package. Additionally, there may be cached files in /var/cache/tomcat6 that may affect a reinstall, so you should check that directory before reinstalling, too.\nEDIT:\nIf purging tomcat's config doesn't solve the problem, there may be more causes for tomcat stopping to work, e.g. a messed-up java setup. To check this, the easiest way is to install a second JRE (OpenJDK, for example), modify the alternatives so the newly-installed JDK is used (sudo update-alternatives --config java), and restart tomcat. If this works, the problem is likely caused by the config of the previously used JRE/JDK.\nIf it doesn't work, more information about tomcat's malfunction are required: details about tomcat's behaviour, error messages when running tomcat manually from the command line, contents of tomcat's logs (catalina.out and so on).\n\nA: Better you completely remove the tomcat6 from your system.\nTo remove completely tomcat6 do the following steps:\ndpkg -l | grep tomcat\n\nto list all packages related with tomcat in your system. \nNow you can use \nsudo dpkg -P packageName\n\nwhere packageName is the name of package you get from the first step (second column). \nThis should firmly purge your tomcat from the system, but if it doesn't - give me a sign, and we will try something more :-) \nAfter you successfully remove tomcat6, re-install it using apt-get\n", "Q: Dash in Unity-2D: how to tweak search?

I need to render an SVG image with very small text, so I would like to use subpixel hinting, like so:\n\nInkscape doesn't provide an option to use subpixel hinting for PNG export, neither does the GIMP. However, I get excellent results when I view the image in EOG, the Gnome Image Viewer. \nHow do I use whatever Image Viewer uses to render my SVGs to PNG files with transparency?\nSince subpixel hinting depends on the order of red, green and blue subpixels, EOG disables it when I use the Save As button. I can take a screenshot, but then I don't have transparency in my images. Is there any piece of software that can render text to raster images with anti-aliasing and subpixel hinting?\n\nA: http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/getting-crisper-text-out-of-inkscape should help you :)\nThis blog post advises to select File → Save a Copy → Cairo PNG for cairo-based rendering.\n\nA: Anyway, I wanted to suggest SubLCD as I've used it in the past, but as it works with PPM images I just don't remember how I did transparency, and it's unusable for small fonts as is\nHere is quick and dirty solution (I don't know about your source files and if this is usable to you, but in general works fine):\nRender SVG on screen with EOG or else.

All apps like Chrome or Skype still open Nautilus like default. Thanx for any help.\n\nA: This question was asked of the Marlin maintainer on Ubuntu Launchpad at the end of May 2011. This is the link to the answer that was marked as solved.\nHow to set Marlin as the default file manager\nNotice this answer given by the maintainer on the first of June 2011:\n\nHello, to make marlin default filemanager just click on a folder in\n  nautilus \"open with\" and select marlin and check default application.\n  However nautilus on gnome draw the desktop too, marlin doesn't, u can\n  disable nautilus desktop via gconf or u can remove the filemanager\n  flag in the session files (if u re using unity) or in gconf on other\n  systems.\nAnyway it's a bit earlier to make marlin a default application, it's\n  not released yet, we'll find an automated way to make it default when\n  the time come.\nHappy testing.\n\nA similar question was asked again on 10th December 2011 and also marked as solved. Here is the link.\nAnother Launchpad question about making Marlin the default file manager\nSo, you are using an application that is still being developed and is perhaps fit for testing but not yet ready for being a Nautilus replacement. It may work fine as a simple file manager but Nautilus does more than browse files and folders. This is why Nautilus stills opens when you perform the actions that you describe.\nIt also seems that Marlin is more suited to the Xfce desktop environment than the Gnome environment whether Gnome 2 or Gnome 3\nHere is a link to the exo-utils package mentioned in the other links. Notice this description:\n\nThis package contains the Xfce settings plugin and the utility files\n  for ....\n\nLaunchpad link to exo-utils Oneiric package\nThe only other thing I can add is that you will find the exo-utils package in the Ubuntu software Centre but notice that it is listed as being an Xfce settings plugin.

I have a crontab file that looks like this:\n* * * * * /home/abliskovs/update/update.sh\nHowever when I check the syslog for evidence that the job has run, there is nothing that might indicate that it ever ran. How can I check if it's running?\ncrontab -l outputs the following:\n* * * * * /home/abliskovs/update/update.sh\n\nA: Make sure that the script file is executable {chmod 755} otherwise it will not execute it\n\nA: \nAdd a >>/tmp/testlog.log to the end of your crontab entry (to redirect\n  output to a file you can investigate or check if it's running,\n  additionally a 2>&1 would include output from the error console)\n\nExample\n\n0 * * * * /home/abliskovs/update/update.sh 2>&1 /tmp/testlog.log\n\nAlso Make Sure the followings :\n\n\n*\n\n*Add cronjobs in a right manner. if you've used crontab -e within your own account, scripts are run with your user (and thus the\ncrontab entry has one field less -- the user to run it, as that is\nknown).

I did not write a custom xorg.conf.\n\nA: The values of the X System virtual screen can be configured by System > Preferences > Monitors (in Ubuntu 10.10, I did not try 11.10).  The configuration is automatically made to /etc/X11/xorg.conf when the physical screen selections and screen rotation selections are made via the System > Preferences > Monitors tool.  Still, rotation might not be possible for all resolutions since there is a limit set when the X System starts.  \nTo overcome this I did not need to change the video card.  Instead I manually edited /etc/X11/xorg.conf to set the virtual resolution in both dimensions to double the longest dimension of my monitors.  This made rotation possible.  This is not to say that this solution will work if graphics card memory is limited but in my case it worked.\n", "Q: Function Keys the wrong way around on Packard Bell Dot S I have a Packard Bell Dot S netbook (also called Dot 510 I think), and to get an F3 key press I have to press Fn+F3, pressing just F3 on its own turns the wireless on or off. I make heavy use of the F Keys, so I'd like it if I didn't have to use the Fn key to get them.\nMy BIOS doesn't seem to have an option to swap them round, is there any way I can do it at the OS Level in Ubuntu?\nThanks.\nUPDATE\nFWIW here is what is in my bios:\nInsydeH20 Setup Utility Rev 3.5\nInformation:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU type.speed, memory info etc etc\n\n\nMain:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time, Date, Quiet Boot, Network Boot, F12 Boot Menu, D2D Recovery, SATA Mode\n\n\nSecurity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Supervisor Password, Set User password, Set HDD password\n\n\nBoot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Order stuff\n\n\nExit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Saving Changes etc etc\n\n\nUnless there is a hidden page? I recall a BIOS from years ago that had a hidden page. Googling shows nothing tho.\nUpdate 2\nOk, it seems that xmodmad will only work for some keys. The wireless switch key, for example, works even when X is not running, so it must be at a lower level that it is being intercepted. I can't even get the keycodes for this key.\n\nA: You may try remapping your keyboard like they did in this thread. You can use the gui tool xmodmaps to find out the information you need. The command you will most likely need is xmodmap -e 'keycode 69=F3' or something like that.\n\nA: I had the same issue on Dot SC, but it seems that Packard Bell corrected its mistake and finally included in BIOS setup an option to restore normal Function Keys behavior (BIOS ver. 1.9 dated 2012-10-23).\n\nA: From the (un)help file on the HP laptop:\nNote: It is not necessary to press the Fn key to use the F1 to F12 function keys when starting your computer or when using the BIOS.\nTo swap the hotkey and special function of the F1 to F12 keys, change the function key setting in the BIOS (to open the BIOS press F2 when starting your computer, then select the Main menu and change Function key behavior to\nFunction keys).\n", "Q: Opening Doc file in LibreOffice with password in writing mode I want to open password protected [not read only] doc file [saved in LibreOffice] to write, but i cant type. How to solve this problem ?\n\nA: You can toggle the edit mode using this button:\n\nIf the file is write-protected, a message will appear. The content of the message depends on the reason for the write protection:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the file itself is protected (on file system level), you wil be asked to create a copy of that document to work with. To remove the file protection, you will have to change the file's attributes (using a file manager or a terminal using the chmod +w filename command). \n\n*If the document is saved with write protection (on application level), you will be prompted for the password that was set when the doc was saved.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that there may be two (different) passwords set for a certain document. LibreOffice allows for setting separate passwords to open a file and to edit it:\n\nSo, even if it's possible to open a password-protected libreoffice doc, there may be another password set to prevent editing.\n\nA: If you are the creator of the original file, you can save a copy of the file, edit that, and then overwrite the original later, adding the password when you save.\nThis is only of course if tohuwawohu's answer does not work for you.\n", "Q: Assigning permission to C++ program I'm trying to run a program in C++ compiladom in Ubuntu, but is giving permission denied.

I haven't done anything to change my interface.\nIn any case, how do I get back the theme I had before? I think it was \"human\" or \"gnome\" or something like that. Nice orange folders and stuff.\n\nA: If you install gnome-tweak-tool:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\nyou can access more customization options, including the theme, by launching 'Advanced settings' or gnome-tweak-tool through a terminal. A good starting point would be to see if the original themes (ubuntu-mono-dark for icons, ambiance for window and gtk+) are still listed in this tool under 'Theme'.\n", "Q: How do I make quickly apps install into /opt?

Upon trying to play the same files in Totem, the same problem appears again. \nI think that the problem started after following option C in this guide, and then undoing it.\nI've tried reinstalling gstreamer0.1-plugin-ugly, gstreamer0.1-ffmpeg and gstreamer0.1-fluendo-mp3, which are the packages I think Rhythmbox is asking for upon playing a MP3 encoded file.\nRunning Ubuntu 10.04, recently updated.\n\nA: The -ffmpeg package allows playback of mp3s, but not seeking.  It's possible that if you have both -plugins-ugly and -ffmpeg installed, Rhythmbox (or any other gstreamer-based media player) will choose to use -ffmpeg istead of the ugly plugin, and you will not be able to seek.\ngstreamer0.1-plugin-ugly should cover all of your mp3 needs, so you can safely uninstall the gstreamer0.1-ffmpeg package.\nFor more background on the issue, see a similar bug reported against Banshee, and the much older gstreamer bug it was eventually closed as a duplicate of.  Also note that an mp3 parser is now included in the -good gstreamer plugin, so this issue should not affect newer versions of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to open the display from ssh login? Is there any way to open the desktop display from terminal(ssh login)?\n\nA: If you're just talking about running a graphical application  from the terminal, you can specify the DISPLAY environment value like so:\nDISPLAY=:0 gcalctool\n\nOr if you want it to persist you can export it to remain part of your bash session:\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n\n\nA: You can use the -X option to forward graphical applications.

FreeNX is both fast and secure.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX\n\nA: I use freerdp-x11 that is front-ended by x2goclient and back-ended by x2goserver, if you are connecting to Linux machines, then the connection is established and secured by ssh. \nThis also enables shadowing.\nAlternatively, xtightvncviewer is rather handy.\nsudo apt clean && sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y\nsudo apt install freerdp-x11\nsudo apt install x2goclient\n\nFor the x2goserver, depending on distro:\nhttps://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:repositories:ubuntu\nYou might need to configure such things as this:\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw allow ssh\n\nThen all you need to do is launch the x2goclient, add in your parameters and pick the desktop type the host is using.\nFor example, I use:\nParameters: \n/cert-ignore /sound /multimedia /multimon +fonts\n\nwhen connecting to a Windows terminal server.\nThe majority of Linux machines are using Lubuntu, which is LXDE, so I pick that and the resolution, the rest works automatically.\n", "Q: How to use intel 2200BG on an HP Pavillion DV1000?

After installing Ubuntu 11.10 , I opened the Update Manager.\nI found that the average download speed for updates is about 12 Kb/sec.\nBut I used to download with 64 Kb/sec.\n\nA: Those are terribly slow speeds. Assuming you have a broadband connection, you should try changing the download server. Try a few close to you.  \nOpen Update Manager and click on the 'Settings' button at the bottom left. Click the 'Ubuntu Software' tab and change servers. I don't know what kind of connection you have but I typically see downloads max out my connection within a few seconds. \n\n\nA: Use apt-fast. \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:apt-fast/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install apt-fast\n\nThen run: \nsudo apt-fast upgrade\n\nTo install the latest updates available.

Former Gentoo user here. I'm trying to optimize the system by recompiling kernel specifically for my processor and disabling code I won't be using (to reduce memory consumption, improve speed etc.). \nI wonder if anybody has lucky experiences with kernel-seeds on top of Ubuntu. Kernel configuration is a dark and deep forest and I'm not sure what would be the best strategy here since I'm concerned about Ubuntu-specific options. Should I start with Ubuntu's configuration and one by one disable the options i don't need or just start configuring it from scratch (default .config or kernel-seeds..) ? \n\nA: First, why are you trying to compile a kernel ? If for learning, that is fine, but with anything resembling modern hardware you are not going to get a performance boost or significant hard drive space savings.\nSecond, the kernel seeds are extremely minimal. You then need to know your hardware.\nTwo tools to make it easier:\nlspci -v\n\nWill identify your hardware and the kernel modules in use.\nYou can also use localmodconfig\nmake localmodconfig\n\nSee http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_32#head-11f54cdac41ad6150ef817fd68597554d9d05a5f\nIMO localmodconfig is a superior tool to starting with a (minimal) kernel seed and build up.\nI started a web page for compiling kernels\nhttp://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/kernel\nThe other issue is the Ubuntu patches, most important Apparmor (see Where do I get the AppArmor 2.4 compatibility patch?) and ureadahead (see this bug report).\nSee the Ubuntu wiki kernel compilation for ubuntu specific information.\n", "Q: USB boot flashes and crashes I went through the steps listed on http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download but it does not work.

I enquired whether this function will be added and was told that this should be added in a future update to the application. This functionality is already available to users of the Ubuntu One Files Android application.\nI imagine that the procedure for doing what you ask will be the same as you currently do for the Android app, so I'll add the steps here and it should be approximately the same when the functionality is eventually added to iOS.\nFirstly in Ubuntu create the new folder where you want the pictures to be uploaded to, then right click on the folder and select Synchronise this Folder from the Ubuntu One section in the menu:\n\nWhen the functionality is added to the iOS app you should be able to select this newly created folder through the settings menu and all new photos will be uploaded to this folder.

To check what those are set to, run the command in a terminal:\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\n\nthat should output something like:\n# Generated by NetworkManager\n1.2.3.4\n1.2.3.5\n\nWith actual IP addresses.  You can try pinging each of those nameservers in order to see if they are all responding, and run some sample domain name lookups against them.

What version of Ubuntu can I run on an old desktop?\nAlso, can I revert to old style navigation in 11.10?\nI have a P4 3ghz\n1 gb ram \n160 gb HDD\ngraphics: VESA: 6330\nI installed 11.10, but it is slow.\n\nA: I recommend Lubuntu. It uses LXDE (Light X11 Desktop Environment) on top of Ubuntu, meaning you still have the latest software provided by Ubuntu, but it will be very snappy on a Pentium 4 (it'll even run on a Pentium 3). If you do install Lubuntu, I'd recommend installing GParted for whenever you'd like to format pendrives, otherwise it pretty much includes all the features most users need. I've ran Lubuntu in previous versions (Lubuntu 11.04, 11.10) and can certainly vouch for it. I don't think I could recommend anything else unless you want to try Puppy Linux or Damn Small Linux, though they may not offer all the features of the Ubuntu distribution.\nYou could install Gnome Classic desktop by entering the following command in the terminal: sudo apt-get install gnome-fallback-session, then log out, click on the button next to the username/password and select Gnome Classic. It still won't be nearly as fast as Lubuntu. Gnome Classic wasn't included in Ubuntu 11.10 because it falls back on Unity 2D if 3D acceleration isn't supported by the hardware.\n\nA: I recommend either Lubuntu or Xubuntu.  Xubuntu is a little more flexible and a lot of people supposedly went to Xubuntu because of Gnome Shell, Unity and what ever else they didn't like with 11.04 and 11.10.  Xubuntu can be customized to look and work like Gnome 2.  Xubuntu can be installed via terminal by entering sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install xubuntu-desktop or you can do a clean install by going to Xubuntu's home site.  I had better luck with a clean install but that is me personally. After installing open the Ubuntu Software Center and install Xubuntu restricted extras.\nIf you decide with Lubuntu, you can upgrade the same way. \nPer you question, you will be running Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: To give you an idea of how Ubuntu will run on an old PC:\nI have a Dell Dimension e310. I upgraded the ram to 2GB. It has a P4 521 Ht 2.8ghz. I had Ubuntu 10.04 LTS but it recently lost support, so I was forced to make a decision. I could either download and install Lubuntu or another stable, lightweight, release. I loved Ubuntu 10.04. I decided to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04.\nI am currently running it, and I love it. It runs perfectly. I would not recommend Ubuntu 13.04 or later. Also,Ubuntu 12.04 is long term release. I believe it is supported until 2016 or 2017. Not really sure. But if you want to have a lot of speed and productivity then I would strongly recommend Lubuntu. But Ubuntu 12.04 is very responsive and fast on this old hardware. I would check to see if you can upgrade the ram on your particular computer. 2 GB of memory works perfect for me but if you can go up to 4 and have the money then do it. \n", "Q: How do I get my Lenovo T61 to connect to a wireless network?

Also, the crash reports that you saved might be valuable in reporting a bug to launchpad.\n\nA: Since there's a bug in apport that breaks standard unix command line debugging, and this bug has been known since 2007 (I'm going to buy it a cake when it turns 10) (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/+bug/160999) turning it off is far and away the best thing to do if you are trying to fix your own code.\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 16.04 systemd apport does not seem to honor its config file\nThe systemd commands to enable / disable apport are:\nDisable\nsudo systemctl disable apport.service\n\nIf that does not work, you would then need to mask the service\nsystemctl mask apport.service\n\nTo reenable\nsystemctl unmask apport.service # if you masked it\nsudo systemctl enable apport.service\n\n\nPrevious versions of Ubuntu:\nYou need to edit /etc/default/apport.

Apport will now no longer start at boot.

I had both tried disabling apport via cmdline (sudo systemctl disable apport.service), GUI (see this hopefully-original blog post), and via removal (sudo apt purge); however, Python backtraces showed apport still being present.\nIt seems like python3-apport is a prereq of ubuntu-desktop (relates launchpad bug 1773087), so may be hard to remove it.\nI then looked at the Apport#Crash_interception, and seems like we can hack /etc/python*/sitecustomize.py.\nAs an example, the following worked (disabled apport) on my system for python3.6:\n# N.B. Authenticate sudo first!\ncat | sudo tee /etc/python3.6/sitecustomize.py <<EOF\n## install the apport exception handler if available\n#try:\n#    import apport_python_hook\n#except ImportError:\n#    pass\n#else:\n#    apport_python_hook.install()\nEOF\n\nEDIT: Didn't try doing stuff like isolated mode in python3 - dunno if that'd work with Ubuntu-baked site customizations.\n", "Q: Autofill (with incrementing row-number) in spreadsheet programs doesn't work as expected \nI have two rows with values and third row must be a difference between first and second row, like here:\n3 5  1 . .\n2 2  5 . .\n1 3 -4 . .\nI enter a formula in the 3rd row 2nd column: =$B3-$B4\nI enter a formula in the 3rd row 3rd column: =$C3-$C4\nAnd then I (as used in MS excel) select 2 and 3 columns in 3rd row and grab the dot in the bottom right corner, then i pulling it to the right to extend for some columns.\nAs a result I want to see =$D3-$D4 and =$E3-$E4\nBut I see only repeating =$B3-$B4, =$C3-$C4, =$B3-$B4, =$C3-$C4, =$B3-$B4, =$C3-$C4.\n\nTried this in LibreOffice Calc and Gnumeric.\nVersions:\nLibreOffice 3.3.4 \nOOO330m19 (Build:401)\ntag libreoffice-3.3.3.1, Ubuntu package 1:3.3.4-0ubuntu1\n\nGnumeric: 1.10.13\n\nA: Well, In your question some parts are not clear.

I want to have my daughter-in-law share videos of our first grandson.  Can you send me instructions on how to have her upload videos so we can watch them?  Thank you. \n\nA: Ubuntu can play every commonly-used video format. Simply have the videos uploaded in the way they were before you switched to Ubuntu. I really can't imagine a technology your daughter-in-law might upload to that wouldn't work. You may be asked to install a \"video codec\" or player, but Ubuntu will recognize and install the required software automatically.\nIf you do not know how to share videos to begin, I recommend uploading to YouTube and selecting the \"Unlisted\" option to keep the videos private. Then you can simply watch and share the videos through your internet browser.\n", "Q: How do I create a remote location? So here is my deal. I'm thinking about using Bluefish to do remote file editing (PHP, HTML, Js etc) on our webserver.

So I was thinking that I could create a remote location in Ubuntu and then hopefully the remote directory would appear in the Bluefish navigation area.\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nA: you are going to get a number of suggestions for this.

He is using Mac OSX, so he just zipped the contents of his ~/Library/KeyboardLayouts and sent it to me. Of course, the files don't seem portable to Ubuntu without modification - at least I don't understand how...\nAmong the files, the file that seems to do the actual work is a file called Svorak.keyboard, which in fact is an XML file defining the keyboard layout. The first section of the file is shown below:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE keyboard SYSTEM \"file://localhost/System/Library/DTDs/Keyboard.dtd\">\n<keyboard group=\"0\" id=\"0\" name=\"Svorak\" maxout=\"2\">\n        <layouts>\n        <layout first=\"0\" last=\"0\" modifiers=\"28\" mapSet=\"a0\"/>\n    </layouts>\n    <modifierMap id=\"28\" defaultIndex=\"7\">\n        <keyMapSelect mapIndex=\"0\">\n            <modifier keys=\"command?\"/>\n            <modifier keys=\"anyShift command caps?\"/>\n        </keyMapSelect>\n        <keyMapSelect mapIndex=\"1\">\n            <modifier keys=\"anyShift caps?\"/>\n        </keyMapSelect>\n...\n    </modifierMap>\n    <keyMapSet id=\"a0\">\n        <keyMap index=\"0\">\n            <key code=\"0\" action=\"8\"/>\n            <key code=\"1\" action=\"o\"/>\n            <key code=\"2\" action=\"e\"/>\n...\n\nIs there any (easy) way I can take this layout and re-map it into a standard Ubuntu format? I'd like to install it alongside my regular QWERTY layout, so I can switch between them using the applet in the status bar etc - in other words, I want to install it as any other installed keyboard layout in Ubuntu.\nIs that possible? How?\n\nA: So the short answer is, \"no.\" The feature you are asking for does not exist.\nThe XML format you mentioned was introduced in Jaguar and while they published the DTD, that format is specific to Apple. I was not able to find any mention whatsoever of any other operating system importing this XML keyboard format, probably because generally most operating systems come with their own extensive database of keyboard layouts. There are  Dvorak layouts bundled with Linux, though they may not be tweaked how your friend tweaked his.\nHaving said that, if certain features of the layout are important to you, you could try making your own keymap with this tutorial.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: I have never tried this, but I found an article that might help you\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Howto%3A%20Custom%20keyboard%20layout%20definitions\nI know this isn't first hand experience, so I don't know if I should post this as a comment and not an answer, but I'm sure a nice mod will let me know :)\n", "Q: Problem when trying to run script Есть проблема на Ubuntu 11.10, при запуске sh скриптов, без активной консоли, команда who не отображает активных пользователей, а в скрипте необходимо знать, какой пользователь активен сейчас.

Who ever came across?\n\nBy the way acpi package has a bug related to my problem, its script is also used by the command who.\n$ dpkg -l | grep acpi | awk '{print $2 \"_\" $3}'\nacpi_1.5-3ubuntu1\nacpi-support_0.138\nacpid_1:2.0.10-1ubuntu2.3\n\n$ grep who /usr/share/acpi-support/*\n/usr/share/acpi-support/power-funcs: user=$(who | awk \"/:$displaynum)/ { print \\$1; exit }\")\n/usr/share/acpi-support/power-funcs: user=$(who | awk \"/:$displaynum/ { print \\$1; exit }\")\n\nI think this can be fixed:\nuser=$(users | sed 's | |\\n|g' | uniq)\n\n\n____ Updated 12.01.2012\nThe problem is not solved!\nSmall amusing experiment:\nfor the test with who and user commands, I run the terminal, and add the following lines to /etc/crontab:\n* * * * *   root    echo 'who: '`who` >> /123\n* * * * *   root    echo 'users: '`users` >> /123\n* * * * *   root    echo 'users /var/run/utmp: '`users /var/run/utmp` >> /123\n* * * * *   root    echo 'users /var/log/wtmp: '`users /var/log/wtmp` >> /123\n\nAnd check the /123 file when terminal is running:\nusers /var/log/wtmp: administrator administrator...\nwho: administrator pts/3 2012-01-12 14:59 (:0.0)\nusers: administrator\nusers /var/run/utmp: administrator\n\nwhen  terminal is closed:\nwho: \nusers: \nusers /var/run/utmp: \nusers /var/log/wtmp: administrator administrator ...\n\nAgain, the question of how to get a list of users logged on to the system (X session), from the console as root.\nUntil I see only one solution:\nuser=$(users /var/log/wtmp | sed 's| |\\n|g' | uniq)`\n\nWho knows a more elegant solution? Or is this just an option?\nOr maybe it's still a bug?\n\nA: The currently logged-in user is set in the environment variable $USER\necho $USER\n\nThis should give you all you need. For a list of all users logged-in run\nusers\n\n", "Q: subshell ls -lh \"$(find /music -type d)\" doesn't return list, instead results of find command I'm trying to list the details of all the directories in my music folder using the following command:\nls -lh \"$(find /music -type d)\"\n\nHowever all I get is the return of the find command.  Is this syntax correct?  I'm using ubuntu server 10.04.  I think I remember a few weeks ago trying this on gui ubuntu 10.04 and it seemed to output the details of the ls command\n\nA: It works, without the quotes\nls -lh $(find /music -type d)\n\nWith the quotes ls -l sees the find as a single file rather then a list of items. Look closer at the output , do you not see\nls: cannot access ...\nlist of find results\nlast item : No such file or directory\n\n", "Q: What is the UID (user id) & GID (group id) that Samba Service using? What is the default UID (user in) and GID (group id) that Samba service using? For an example, Apache2 runs as www-data, likewise what is the UID that Samba service using?\n\nA: Samba runs as root, and when you connect, it changes to your user.\n\nA: Using ps -eo uid,gid,args|grep myprocess helps you to find the UID and GID of a running process. For samba, replace myprocess by smbd and nmbd.\n", "Q: Assign standard exit status to a makefile variable I'm trying to save the standard exit status of a command in a variable of my makefile, but I don't know how to do it. \nI've tried this:\npruebas:\n    @A= $(ls)\n\n...but it doesn't work.\n\nA: You can execute a command in the shell from the Makefile by using the $(shell command) syntax.\nIf for instance you would want to exit status of the ls command in bash you would type:\nls --qwfpgjl > /dev/null 2>&1 ; echo $?\n\nThis might need some explanation: the > /dev/null 2>&1 part redirects both standard output and standard error to /dev/null so you don't see any output, and then 'echo $?' prints the exit status of the last command. You can try this in the command line to see if it works for you, for instance \nls --qwfpgjl > /dev/null 2>&1 ; echo $?\n\nshould give you \n2\n\nsince that is the error ls returns when there is an unknown argument (see the ls man page).\nNow how to include this in your Makefile? Simply add the line\nA=$(shell ls > /dev/null 2>&1 ; echo $$?)\n\nto your Makefile. Note the extra $ in $$?, it tells make that $? is not a variable in the Makefile.\nThat should be it! Here you can see the Makefile I used to test this behavior: \n#SHELL := /bin/bash\nA=$(shell ls > /dev/null 2>&1 ; echo $$? )\n\ntest:\n    @echo $A\n.PHONY: test\n\n\nNotes:\nmake picks the /bin/sh shell by default, but you can override this by setting \nSHELL := /bin/bash\n\nThis can be useful for more complicated commands that don't execute in /bin/sh.\n", "Q: remove third party software \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install software using the Ubuntu Software Center? \n\nI've just installed ubuntu 11.10 but having some problems \n1.can't able to view installed software \n2.can't able to install new software\n3.can't able to remove third party software\nso what can i do to fix this problem?\n\nA: The software-center should help you in this task.

( ubuntu oneiric 11.10 server) \nHere is my /etc/fstab\n\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\nUUID=4e455083-9ac0-4076-ab25-dedcf461a578 /               ext4    noatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1\nUUID=9e691b30-8f85-4566-86cd-587de6571ce8 /storage/HDD/SAM-1500-1 ext4    defaults        0       2\nUUID=1888e5df-2fe5-4760-a271-09676504e168 /storage/HDD/SAM-2000-1 ext4    defaults        0       2\nUUID=dc321a2e-8266-42de-9b79-7a1b33eacf6c /storage/HDD/SEA-1000-1 ext4    defaults        0       2\nUUID=987ef5ec-01d2-4542-8e69-a38bed12ddfa /storage/HDD/SEA-1000-2 ext4    defaults        0       2\nmhddfs#/storage/HDD/SAM-2000-1/Medias,/storage/HDD/SAM-1500-1/Medias,/storage/HDD/SEA-1000-1/Medias,/storage/HDD/SEA-1000-2/Medias /storage/BigData/Medias fuse defaults,allow_other,nofail 0 0\n\n\nIf the periodic fsck run starts during boot, my mhddfs mount fails and the server waits for a ctrl+d to continue boot...\nHow can I prevent the \"hang\" while keeping my periodic fsck runs ?\n\nA: When you look at the sixth field in your /etc/fstab, you see there a 0. This means the mhddfs is not automatically fscked. So one workaround of your problem is to add noauto to your fstab:\nmhddfs#/storage/HDD/SAM-2000-1/Medias,/storage/HDD/SAM-1500-1/Medias,/storage/HDD/SEA-1000-1/Medias,/storage/HDD/SEA-1000-2/Medias /storage/BigData/Medias fuse defaults,allow_other,nofail,noauto 0 0\n\nSo the filesystem will not automatically mounted at startup. Furthermore you write a script which basically mounts your mhddfs and add it at some late point in the boot process.\nThis makes sure that the fsck runs normal. If your system tries to mount the mhddfs, all other fscks are finished and your system should boot normal.\n", "Q: What is best hard disk configuration for Ubuntu 11.10? I have an old dell optiplex 260, built in graphic, Lan & sound. With Pentium 4 (2.80GHz), 1GB ram and 80GB hard disk.\nCan i install Ubuntu 11.10 on it? \nI'm dying to check it out first before I change it in my regular work laptop. Please tell me how to create partition and in which size for best results?\n\nA: if you just want to try it out I suggest you create a Live CD. and boot from that and click on the alternative try it out.\nOR\nyou could go to the Ubuntu homepage and try out Ubuntu via a webbrowser. \nWhen you want to install it you can easily go back to the live cd and choose Install instead of try it out. In the next menu you will be asked if you want to make a partition or if you just want to use the whole disk. \nIf you have any further questions, just ask in the comment and I will explain it more in my answer. \n\nA: The installer will recommend you the best option during install. (Usually one swap one \"/\" partition) \nMy manual choice is this (adjusted to your configuration). I create 4 partitions, one for boot, one swap one for / and one for home.\n    /dev/sda1 -> /boot (ext3 or ext2) 100MB\n    /dev/sda2 -> swap (swap) 512 MB (some say that you need 1GB or even 2GB)\n    /dev/sda3 -> / (ext4 or xfs) 9 GB (it will be enough)\n    /dev/sda4 -> /home (xfs or ext4) the rest ~ 70 GB\n\nIf you set your /home to ext4 you need to lower the reserved space size from 5% to 0%. Don't try btrfs, it is not good enough at the moment.\nTry first a live CD and check if everything works (wlan, graphics, Unity 3D, speed) if you feel that it is slow, try Xubuntu, it has less requirements.\n\nA: Will it work?\nProbably. But why not try a livecd first?\nhttp://ubuntu.com/download\nHow to partition?\nThe installer will ask if you want it to automatically partition your hard drive. It has sane defaults. No need to manually do it unless you like tinkering.\n\nA: For a Pentium 4 I strongly recommend installing Lubuntu. It uses the Light X11 Desktop Environment (LXDE) on top of Ubuntu, making it very light and offering the latest software available in Ubuntu. I've ran Lubuntu (versions 10.10 and 11.04) on Pentium 4's and it works like a charm. With 1GB RAM, you may want to try Xubuntu as suggested by gajdipajti or even normal Ubuntu could work (though you may prefer using a Gnome-Classic desktop with the default Ubuntu if you find Unity to be slow).\nFor disk partitioning the default should be fine, 2GB SWAP, then the rest for the operating system in Ext4. You may want to create a third partition (also Ext4) for stashing backups/files/etc of 20, 30 or 40GB. Even if you install a lot of applications from the repositories, it's unlikely that your operating system will exceed 10GB (without counting personal files).\n", "Q: Why do I have poor video capture quality, and how can I improve it? I have a dual boot Lenovo Ideapad U260. If I use Skype or a Google+ hangout from Ubuntu, the video quality is a bit poor. I can't adjust the brightness either. But if I boot to Windows, the video quality is better.\nAny suggestions for the applications that I can try to improve it? \n\nA: A good application that can be used to adjust webcam and video quality is Video4Linux Control Centre\nThis program allows you to change various parameters such as brightness, sharpness and contrast to hopefully improve the quality of your webcam/video capture device's picture quality.\nTo see the effects of any adjustments you are making you can use Skype. Enter the Skype options menu and select Video Devices and click the Test button. With this window open launch Video4Linux Control Centre and any changes you make to the settings can be seen to take effect in the preview window of Skype (You can double click the preview window to view this full screen). Or you could use a dedicated webcam application such as Cheese to view your video device's picture as you make changes.\n\n\nA: I install Intel ® Graphics for Linux and get the same video quality as Windows 7. I use the following link:\nhttps://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/2013/intelr-graphics-installer-1.0-linux\nMy OS is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n", "Q: Volume control doesn't work for headphones Fresh install of 11.10 and the gnome panel's volume control doesn't work for headphones but does work for speakers on my laptop. \nIn sound settings I have Internal Audio Analogue Stereo selected for output (Output tab) and Analogue Speakers selected for Connector. When I plug headphones in, the volume control doesn't work and the volume is maximum through the headphones. \nOn a side note, only one of my two headphone sockets produces sound too (whereas both worked in 10.04)\n\nA: My laptop has two headphones sockets: headphone socket 2 (the one I was using) is permanently on 100%, whereas socket 1 is actually under the volume control, IF Analogue Speakers is selected. However, even if I have Analogue Speakers selected, it is automatically changed to Analogue Headphones when the headphones are plugged in (to socket 1). \nThe workaround is to manually reset it to Analogue Speakers after plugging in headphones. Every time you plug in headphones. Best keep that Sound Settings window open.\n\nA: For some reason Analog Headphones does not work as expected - volume is really low even if it's set to 100%.\nMy solution was to explicitly switch Output to Analogue Speakers in audio settings after headphones are plugged in.\n", "Q: How to get WIFI at my home for an Ipod use? I have ubuntu at my home with 2 desk tops, 1 is a mac, both are wired to t How can I get wifi at my house to use with an Ipod and other things?\n\nA: The easiest solution would be to get a wireless router, share your internet with other computers on whichever connection you have from the pc to the router, and then connect your ipod to your router via wifi.\n", "Q: How to remove a repository and all it's installed programs? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I remove all packages from a certain repository? \n\ni have installed programs from the nautilus-actions-extra and it cause a lot of problems so i want to remove this repository and all it's programs. so how to do that ???\n\nA: You can try ppa-purge. \nFor that, you need to already have the PPA to your system so that ppa-purge can analyse the packages installed from that PPA.\nFirst of all, install ppa-purge by running the following command in a terminal: sudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nThen, run a command similar to this: sudo ppa-purge nautilus-actions-extra\nAfter running ppa-purge, run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade and the packages will be reverted to the default repository. \n\nA: Alternatively, in Synaptic (if you don't have Synaptic installed, run sudo apt-get install synaptic), you can filter available packages by origin, then click on the PPA containing the packages you wish to remove, then select them for removal or complete removal. Then in Software Sources you can remove the PPA and update package listings either by clicking on the \"Reload\" button in Synaptic or running sudo apt-get update in the terminal.\n", "Q: Where will be my Grails default installation location?

Is there a PPA with nightly builds of LibreOffice? Or some another source that I can add to my sources.list such that I can try nightly-builds of LibreOffice?\nI know about the various ways to get the nightlies manually, but I want that the builds are updated with the sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade commands.\n\nA: You can try the PPA available here: https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa\nThe description of the PPA reads as thus:\n\nLibreOffice test builds and backports\nMost of the packages in this ppa have only experienced minor testing\n  -- in fact it is the place to enable a wider audience to test packages before they are published into the distro proper. In general this ppa\n  is not for the average user to install without a closer look (if it\n  would be, its packages would be in the main repositories).\n\nRefer to What are PPAs and how do I use them? for instructions on how to add the PPA to your computer.\n\nA: Up to now there has not been a PPA providing this because of the complexities inherited from the old OOo build.\nWith the 3.5/precise release both the upstream build system and the packaging at Debian and Ubuntu have been cleared up enough to make this basically feasable -- if excluding l10n, binfilter and mozilla. Such a PPA would still likely burst default size limitations within one month and still hug a builder machine for >3 hours (on a fast builder) because there is no easy way to reuse a ccache in a ppa -- so I guess there is some clearance needed for this additional resource use.\nNext question would be what to build as there are at least two/three active branches all the time. For example right now:\n\n\n*\n\n*the first being master which will be in the p+1/LibreOffice 3.6 release\n\n*the second libreoffice-3-5 which will be in the precise/LibreOffice 3.5 release\n\n*the third being libreoffice-3-4 which was in the oneiric/LibreOffice 3.4 release\n\n\nMaster is obviously the most interesting, but for QA the release branch (which will be in the next Ubuntu release) can also be interesting.\nSo even with this, there is a lot of details to work out (like versionnames to use etc.). If you are interested, I would be glad to help out though!\n\nA: LibreOffice does not provide any nightly PPA, unfortunately.\nIt seems that for such a large project with multiple branches, doing this would be difficult: reference.\nFor now the only option for daily builds is to use the manual installation options. This answer could be updated in the future if the situation changes.\n\n\nTo clarify I wrote this answer because I was looking for the same\nthing and confirmed that the situation is still the same as it was\nwhen the other answers were written.\n\n\nPerhaps someone could build a weekly/biweekly/monthly build solution, but a nightly build PPA is not going to happen, it seems.\n", "Q: 64-bit Ubuntu Server and Xubuntu alternative install CDs won't install I recently bought a quad-core Gateway computer that is a few years old. I want a minimal installation of Ubuntu, so I'm interested primarily in Ubuntu Server, though Xubuntu is okay too.\nWhen I try the Ubuntu Server 64-bit install CD, I can't install Ubuntu. Whenever I select any menu option (e.g., \"Install Ubuntu Server\"), the computer restarts.\nI tried the Xubuntu alternative install CD with the same problem. The normal Xubuntu install CD works fine, as does a 32-bit Ubuntu Server CD. However, I want to tweak the installation a bit more than the regular Xubuntu install CD allows, I want to use a 64-bit OS, and I'm very curious about why the text-only installation won't work.\nUsing a flash drive with the USB creator program instead of CDs has the exact same result.\nI'd try Lubuntu or plain Ubuntu but I'm lead to believe the problem is with the 64-bit text-only install, not the particular blend of Ubuntu.\nThe md5 hashes for my .iso files are correct. I also have verified that the CDs work correctly on my Dell laptop, which appears to run everything without issue.\nI've tried tweaking some BIOS settings to see if that might make any difference, but it doesn't seem to change anything.\nI tried a memory test (see below). My RAM is good. Still, I removed one stick to see if the total amount might make a difference --- it did not.\nI tried a few different Boot parameters as suggested here. Specifically, I tried BOOT_DEBUG=2 (which didn't display anything because the system restarted before it could) and the few ways of disabling ACPI (which also did nothing). If there are other boot parameters that are worth trying, let me know.\nI tried the 64-bit Ubuntu Server 11.04 CD (instead of 11.10 as I have been trying) with the same problem.\nAt the moment I'm investigating installing with Lubi.\nAnyone know what might be going wrong here or what I should do to figure out what is wrong?\nAlternatively, does anyone know how to install a 64-bit OS from a 32-bit liveCD?\n\nA: Try running the memtest.

I face this problem in schools, and the easy way out for us is not technical: it's OpenDNS Enterprise. You can disallow that kind of activity: warez, porn, proxies, et al, enforcing the AUP of the rental home. It's certainly a lot cheaper than attorney fees, far easier to implement, and proves you have countermeasures in place! :)\nOh - and it can be configured to work differently (or the same) in multiple locations.\n\nA: I have a simple solution: any proxy server.

Our small company runs an Ubuntu Server 11.10, to which a couple of people have SSH access. The actual terminals are sometimes used, too. How can we locally log all Bash commands run, along with user and time stamp?\nWe can assume that no-one is nefarious and actively trying to avoid the logging, but we'd still prefer the users not to have direct write-access to their log files. Simultaneous sessions must be handled correctly.\n\nA: A process accounting system may be helpful in this regard, particularly the acct package that provides the lastcomm and ac commands.\nThe ac commands prints out statistics about users' connection time, in hours. This is the amount of time that the user has been connected to the system, either remotely via SSH or a serial terminal, or while on the console. \nThe lastcomm command displays information about the previously executed commands. The most recent entries are given at the top of the list. Also displayed is the total amount of CPU time that each process used. \nAn old tutorial that may be helpful is here:\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6144?page=0,1\nOther accounting commands like last and so on can be found in this tutorial:\nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/article/system-accounting-in-linux/1053377\n\nA: You could use snoopy.\nSnoopy logger may suit your purpose well.

Is there a way to see how many downloads there have been for a public folder? \nI'm sharing something on Ubuntu One that I want to be able to track the quantity of downloads.\n\nA: No, at the moment you cannot track the number of downloads of files that you share publicly.\nIt is not implemented in Ubuntu One and I cannot find it on the feature roadmap so I would not expect it. It is just something that is not so much requested, I would say.\n\nA: You mention in a comment that you are hosting a public folder through Ubuntu One. That is strange because we don't have that feature :-)\nIf you are sharing a folder with another user, there is no meaningful way to measure it, since the user maybe doesn't download the files in the traditional sense, but syncs it instead.\nIf you are publishing a file, no, we don't offer any statistics, but you could use something like http://bit.ly where it will shorted the URL and give you stats about how people use it.\n\nA: You're providing much too little information. You tagged this windows, are you hosting or downloading the files in windows? At any rate, not knowing anything about the software or files you want to share, all I can recommend at this point is finding a web-based file hosting site that you feel comfortable using. I found this article mentioning 20 of them, but unfortunately the only one that was explicitly described to track downloads was upload-this.com (which seemed to be down at the time of writing), though sendspace.com seems to be up and their slogan mentions \"track & share big files\". If it's just a matter of sharing files I recommend using a website to host your files.\nA much more complicated solution would be to set up a webserver yourself (there are many well documented blogs on how to do this with Ubuntu) and use some of the webserver's tracking tools to check the traffic of those files.\n", "Q: usb0 ethernet on 10.04.3 Server I am installing Ubuntu 10.04.3 on IBM System x3400 M3 which is listed as certified for Ubuntu 10.04.\nI was unable to configure Broadcom netxtreme II Gigabit Ethernet Driver bnx2 during that point. While troubleshooting for that, I noticed  that the IP address I given during install got tied to usb0. Since I am first time coming across usb0 as an ethernet device, I thought of asking here. If I can assign an IP address to a USB port, how I can use it to communicate across network? Or is there any other use of having usb ethernet?\n\nA: Once the USB network adapter has been configured and detected by the kernel it will show up as any other network interface card would on your computer.\ntyping:\ndmesg\n\nin the console will output the last logged event.

But once I installed it, it was great. It allows you to very easily manage all your Wine prefixes (your virtual C:/ drives). You can use it as intended, or you can do what I do and just use everything from its config screen. But Google will turn up plenty of resources on how to use it.\nSecond, If your using Intel Integrated, you can continue to try if you so choose, but Intel chips don't work to well - if at all - for games in Linux, especially wine. I have a laptop with a GMA965 that wont load anything properly similar to what you described its mostly black textures. However I had a friend with a GMA950 that would display just fine, but games would only get around 3FPS.

Is running \"No Script\" on a Linux system really needed? I'm running Firefox 9 on an Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit system. I try to use repository programs only, and am utilizing the firewall.\n\nA: This is how I see it. When I used to run \"No Script\" it wasn't so much because I was worried about viruses or malware, but because I didn't want advertising companies tracking what I was doing. So while No Script on a Windows system is good for virus prevention, and a few other things. Running No Script on and Unix based system will still protect you - for the most part - from wandering eyes tracking your online activities. \nSo in short if you were wanting to run No Script to protect you from viruses, then no its not really necessary. But if you wanting to run it for pretty much any of its other uses, then yah you can go ahead and run it. Hope I was of some help. \n\nA: If you're concerned about security, I'd recommend using the MVPS hosts file to block advertizing and malaware. To get it, you can download and extract it, then copy its contents to your hosts file, save and close it. Effects kick in immediately, works with every browser as well. Here are the commands:\nwget http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.zip\nunzip ./hosts.zip\ngedit ./HOSTS\n\nThen copy the whole content and close it.\nsudo -H gedit /etc/hosts\n\nPaste at the bottom, save and close. That should block pretty much anything you had NoScript blocking for you. Feel free to use NoScript if you don't like Flash and JavaScript loading by default, but otherwise there's not much of a need for it in Linux.\n", "Q: dual boot mac and existing ubuntu I know this problem's thread are available but mine is different.\nI have two HDD installed.

I switched computers, but this new computer does not have a webcam. I hooked up my kinect, installed stome stuff from OpenKinect.org (can now use glview), and would like to use the Kinect camera as a webcam for this program. How can I do this? The program I wrote is:\nhttp://pastebin.com/usspQXNU\n\nA: Newer kernels (3.0 or higher IIRC) support using the Kinect's RGB camera as a regular webcam. Suppose the Kinect camera is /dev/video0, you can run this command to get a video stream:\n$ gst-launch-0.10 v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-yuv ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink\n\nThat means OpenCV's highgui.cvCreateCameraCapture(0) should also just work (with 0 as the id  for the Kinect camera).\nYou can check if the modules are loaded with this command:\n$ lsmod | grep -i gspca\ngspca_kinect           12936  0\ngspca_main             28366  1 gspca_kinect\nvideodev               98259  2 gspca_main,uvcvideo \n\n\nA: Try this may help you https://github.com/wildbillcat/KinectCam/\nOne more thing, I have same problem but with kinect v2 not kinect v1\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.10 on a dell inspiron 6000 According to my service tag I have a\n 64MB, I6000, M22 Surface Mount Graphics card \n\nwhen i first installed Ubuntu the tool bars were all distorted.  I updated to 10.10 (after many attempts where it would get stuck half way through the installation) and now only the tool bars show up. Anything on the main section of the screen shows up black.I can try clicking around aimlessly and the windows I open are there i just can't see them.Any ideas?\n\nA: When you boot up, press 'e' in the Grub menu to edit your boot options. Look for the part where it says \"quiet splash.\" In the space right after that, type -nomodeset, then press Ctrl-x to boot up. If you can boot after that, before you log in, select Ubuntu2D (no effects) from the little cog menu by the login box. If it is a graphics driver issue, this will let you have a graphically limited desktop until you can install the proprietary drivers from \"Additional Drivers.\" Once those are installed, you can try to see if Unity will work. Good Luck!\n", "Q: Why does my screen not return to full brightness when waking a Lenovo B570 from sleep mode? I have a Lenovo B570 laptop and have Ubuntu 11.10 installed. My problem is that when the screen is turned off through inactivity (set at 10 minutes in the settings), it is very difficult to reawaken the laptop because the screen doesn't 'wake up' to full brightness so that I can re-enter my password.\nAt first I thought that moving the mouse or pressing a keyboard button had no effect and the screen remained black, but in fact the screen does wake up and show the dialogue box to enter my password but the brightness has been turned down to the lowest level so if I squint very hard I can see the password entry dialogue box. But my hardware brightness keys (fn + up/down) do not work (though they work fine in every other circumstance).\nI can unlock by entering my password 'blind' which unlocks the screen but leaves the brightness levels at the lowest possible, now the hardware brightness keys do work. Seems strange behaviour though. If I do a normal lock screen (Ctrl + Alt + L) there are no brightness problems so it must be something to do with the \"turn screen off after 10 minutes\" (possibly a fault with gnome-screensaver ?)\nThe same behaviour occurs when the laptop is on AC power or running from the battery. Having searched around the subject a bit more this question seems very similar, though there was no real answer proposed: https://askubuntu.com/questions/66932/screen-sleeps-but-cant-be-rewoken-on-an-hp-nx6310 \nPotentially as this may be a fault in the kernel might it be a good idea to update to the 12.04 version of the kernel? and if I needed to report this as a bug on Launchpad what package would I say was involved?\nThanks for any time and help.\n\nA: I think you should file a bug in Launchpad in which you will explain the steps to reproduce the bug and specify that it happens only after wake from suspend. If you are unsure which package it affects, then for your kind of problem you can choose the kernel, as it is explained in this answer about how to report bugs.\n", "Q: Keyboard messed up in both Windows and Ubuntu after updates I just installed Ubuntu 11.10 with Wubi to try it out on my Asus N82J notebook. Problem is that during the software updates after installation, the keyboard got messed. Like when I press \"o\" it appears \"no\", \"b\" reproduces \"ba\", stuff like that. I changed layouts many times and problem continues.\nSo I changed back to Windows to search on Internet what it could be and for my surprise, Windows is having the same issue.

How do I install my printer with Ubuntu?  The printer disk is only supported by windows.\n\nA: The just \"plug it in\" approach didn't work for me, possibly because I was running off a Live CD. There was only a \"Generic printer\" listed in the print dialog, and printing to it had no effect.\nWhat helped was: go to Printers, click \"Add\". See my printer listed there. Select it. Click \"forward\". Select the default option (install an existing driver). Go through a couple of steps confirming the manufacturer and make. At this point the printer became usable.\nAlso, if you are offered to install \"gutenprint\", cancel, disconnect from the internet, and try again. For me, the \"gutenprint\" install always locks up, and if I choose \"local\" on that screen, the search never finishes either. Only if I disconnect first does it work properly.\n\nA: There are over 1000+ printers supported natively in Ubuntu (or for that matter any other up-to-date distribution). The 1000 supported printers is a little bit short since Linux supports A LOT more.\nThe steps to get your printer working in 99% of the cases is (Follow the instructions precisely to the point. Step by step without jumping any steps):\nStep 1 - Turn Printer ON (If not already done)\nStep 2 - Connect Printer cable to Printer (If not already done)\nStep 3 - Connect other end of Printer cable to Computer with Ubuntu\nStep 4 - Enjoy! ;)\nNOTE - In the case your printer is not automatically found and configured go to System Settings -> Printers and click on the Add button to look for it manually. This method supports USB and Network printers on the same LAN. It also supports looking for the correct drivers for the printer, downloading them and basic configuration in the moment of installation.\nI can show you a small percent of supported printers here:\nhttp://www.cups.org/ppd.php\nbut this list is out-of-date and needs some serious refresh since many of the ones I use are not listed there.\nAnother great source is http://www.openprinting.org/printers which lets you quickly look in a LONGGGGG list of printers. I recommend searching by the manufaturer and then the model because trying to look for list of the manufacturer (second option below) will take a long time and since I am saying there are a lot of printers already literally plug n' play for linux then the list will be huge. I tried HP and lost count.\nIf this is not enough HP offers a one click software for Ubuntu to support a little over 2000+ HP printers here: http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html. Note that many of them are already supported but you will get enhance support like Ink Level notices and better control for the printer for specific stuff for it.\nYou can even find from companies like HP, Epson an Canon an option to actually install the needed drivers from their sites. When you try to install some of the printers from this guys, if the driver is not on your Ubuntu version, you will get an option to download and install it. A case is the Epson L555 which downloads from Epson and supports Wireless printing, Wireless scanning and finding the printer on the LAN.\nUPDATE - Added site list to search for the 2000+ HP printers easier: http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/supported_devices/index.html\n", "Q: Local time with dual-boot \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy does time change in Ubuntu after installing Windows \n\nI have a dual-boot pc (ubuntu/Windows 7). When I boot with Ubuntu my local time (Rome fuse) is correct. But when i boot with wimdows my time is one hour slow.

I didn't fully understand how dual boot worked at the time but now I understand the advantages. \nI don't have a recovery CD (toshiba doesn't include them).\nThe hold '0' and boot option does not work. \nWhat alternatives to ordering a recovery CD from Toshiba do I have?\n\nA: It's not too difficult. Your first hurdle is to grab a copy of Windows 7. Do you know anyone else with a disk? If not there are sites like mydigitallife that regularly update links to download. See the site for details about how this is possible, and to answer the question of the legality of this. As laws vary by country, you should ask a lawyer if you aren't sure about what to do.  \nYou need a Windows product key to use with the laptop. Sometimes the key is on a sticker on the bottom of the laptop. If it's not you might need to buy a key from Microsoft. \nAfter you have a copy of Windows 7, and a key, back up whatever you have in the Ubuntu install. Install Windows first (This will wipe everything on the drive, including Ubuntu), then reinstall Ubuntu. Make sure you do it in that order. Windows first, then Ubuntu. \nIf you sort this out without too much difficulty, post an update with how it went. More people are likely to try Ubuntu if they can see how to switch back to Windows later.\n", "Q: Why does my computer get less battery life with Ubuntu compared to Windows? Last year I purchased a Dell Inspiron 5315 laptop shipping with Windows 7 preinstalled. I installed Ubuntu 10.10 alongside it with dual-booting. On upgrading to Ubuntu 11.10, I was upset to find I now get less than one hour of battery life! Windows 7 gives me 2.5 hours of running time.\nIs there any possible explanation why  my battery is running out faster with Ubuntu? Can anybody tell me better power options?\n\nA: For 13.04\nThere are quite a lot of myths about battery life. Essentially, what kills batteries on the long run is heat. What kills them on the short run are unnecessary services and processes. Windows is fairly good at limiting power use because a lot of collaboration with hardware vendors has gone into optimizing hardware power limitations.\nYou want to try and make sure your computer heats as little as possible when working on battery. On Ubuntu 13.04 you can use TLP. It has the following functions (non exhaustive list):\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel laptop mode and dirty buffer timeouts;\n\n*Processor frequency scaling including \"turbo boost\" / \"turbo core\";\n\n*Power aware process scheduler for multi-core/hyper-threading;\n\n*Hard disk advanced power management level and spin down timeout (per disk);\n\n*SATA aggressive link power management (ALPM);\n\n*PCI Express active state power management (PCIe ASPM) – Linux 2.6.35 and above;\n\n*Runtime power management for PCI(e) bus devices – Linux 2.6.35 and above;\n\n*Radeon KMS power management – Linux 2.6.35 and above, not fglrx;\n\n*Wifi power saving mode – depending on kernel/driver;\n\n*Power off optical drive in drive bay (on battery).\n\n\nThere is a full answer here explaining in great detail how to use and configure it. The answer here might also help you to make sure your (possibly tweaked) settings apply whenever you boot on battery.\nAs for the difference between windows and ubuntu, there are a few questions you should ask yourself:\n\n*\n\n*Do you have a power management tool installed? Something like TLP? Also did you configure it well? [Side note: a power management tool can also make sure you use all your horse power when needed. I have noticed considerable differences.]\n\n*Are you running the same things on Windows and on Ubuntu? Is everything you run necessary (do you have an apache server running for a joomla or wordpress tutorial you once tried)? Sometimes people have a full development stack in Ubuntu and just some office apps in Windows.\n\n*Are the measurements the same? Did you check whether Windows and Ubuntu actually gave you the promised time?\n\n*How many processors do you use? Also when you boot?\n\n*Are you using your GPU? This can make an enormous difference! If you have a Nvidia card with Optimus technology (essentially, this is a power saving option which your Windows machine will support out of the box) you should use bumblebee. By the way, its developpers are great people that help you on the spot in IRC.\n\n*Are you using the same settings for the brightness of your screen?\n\nThe advantage of Ubuntu over and against Windows is that you could also choose another desktop manager (Unity is quite CPU intensive). Better configuration (even with unity) can allow you to double your battery life. Mileage may (and will) vary.\n\nA: You may want to either upgrade to Precise (the development version that will become 12.04LTS when it's released in April), which seems to have improved battery lifetime on my computers. You can also install 10.04LTS and upgrade when 12.04LTS becomes available. 10.04LTS had far better battery life. \n\nA: If you want to get the best out of your battery life you should go for a lightweight setup. Also kernel 3.2 is known to have bettered some of the regressions that happened in earlier kernels.\nThese are the kernel options I use:\npcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor, the acpi_osi=Linux may or may not be relevant on your dell system.\ni915_enable_rc6 enables sleep on idle for the cpu.\npcie_aspm was already explained.\nNow to the low power setup. What you could do is take lxde or razor qt desktop environment or you do it as I do. Take some lightweight wm, and the components out of xfce that you need.\nI'm up to 7 hours of battery time with my laptop when i turn off wifi.\nNow on to laptop-mode. Make sure you have cpufreq installed, then in /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/cpufreq.conf make sure the battery governor is powersave, BATT_CPU_GOVERNOR=powersave.\ncpufreq-info tells you on which governor you are right now.\n\nA: It's claimed that Windows 7 provides better battery life than Ubuntu, I haven't compared it on my laptops though. That said there are many approaches to increase it. Here are those I've found the most effective:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install package laptop-mode-tools. It switches your laptop to a \"laptop mode\" whenever it's on the battery, hard disks are spun down, power saving mode is turned on for peripherals/devices etc.\n\n*Use task manager to find the most intensive processes and disable them (check PowerTOP as well). Also disable boot  services you don't need (apt-get install bum) and services started by your graphical window manager.\n\n*Check that your CPU frequency is scaled down dynamically (cat /proc/cpuinfo).\n\n*Reduce screen brightness (display consumes the most power).\n\n*Some random tips might help, i.e. see this answer.\n\n\nA: There is a reasonably well known kernel issue with power management on PCI Express systems.\nTry editing your boot-up grub entry to include pcie_aspm=force to the kernel parameters, and seeing if that improves your power consumption.\n", "Q: How do I get a Belkin F5D6050 wireless USB network adapter to work?

My laptop (Samsung N510) screen is broken and I've recently tried to install ubuntu 11.10. I'm planning to use the laptop with HDMI connected to my TV.\nWhile installing from a USB stick, both laptop screen (cracked with just light on) and my TV is displaying. When installation is finished and it reboots internal screen is the only one displaying. \nSince I cannot see anything on that screen I was wondering if there are some way to type some kind of a shortcut or how to get into the settings without seeing anything. \n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried the fn+F4 buttons that has the screen on it, but nothing happens.\n\n*I've also tried plugging HDMI cable in before startup, nothing happens, plugging the HDMI cable in while it's on does not work either.\n\n*I've tried unplugging my laptop screen before startup, with HDMI plugged in, (worked in windows) but then the laptop won't boot.\n\n\nIs it impossible?\n\nA: In general laptops and netbooks allow to redirect the output with a key combination. For example on my laptop it's Fn+F5\nLook for a key (usually F1 ... F12) with a screen icon. When pressing the special key Fn and that key, you redirect the output manually. So run your Live CD and press such a key combination few times - until you see the desired image on your monitor. After pressing each time wait a moment for the video card to redirect the output.  \nIf your Fn key doesn't work please refer to your PC's user manual. On my second laptop I can disable/enable those keys with a key combination. Sometimes special keys need some kind of drivers to work.\n\nA: Look to your bios settings. On my thinkpad laptop I am able to switch the default output to HDMI.\nMaybe your Samsung does have that option too.\n", "Q: I tried to use xubuntu with compiz , i see a different decoration theme (very transparent) that leave TRACES all over the desktop and its annoying?

Should I restart my PC every time it gets updated?\n\nA: You only need to restart when the update manager tells you to. It will also be visible in the menu on the top right of your screen. The cog will be red and a red menu item will ask you to restart.\n\nA: You do not have to restart your computer every time you update. Certain updates (such as those that affect your operating system kernel) will require rebooting to take effect. When such an update occurs, your session icon in the upper-right will glow red. \n\n\nA: You dont 'have' to restart, but the only time you have to restart for changes to take effect are kernel upgrades and proprietary driver upgrades.\n\nA: There is another way.\nKsplice allows you to update your system -- even kernel updates -- without restarting.\nIt is free for Fedora and Ubuntu Desktop, but you pay for any other system.\n\nA: Once in awhile a program running on your system gets upset because some parts of it have been updated, but, usually, all you have to quit the program and restart it.  Other than kernel updates as mentioned above, you don't need to restart.\nA major factor in this more civilized behavior is that Linux/UNIX doesn't have a registry system like Windows does.  I don't know the exact mechanics of it, but Windows keeps its registry locked up when it's running and, often, the only way to modify it is to restart the system so changes to the registry can get installed while it's not being used.\nOn the other side of the coin, if you do upgrade your kernel, some programs that you may have compiled yourself (e.g. by running make with a package that came in a tarball) may stop working when you upgrade a kernel until you recompile them.  vmware player is like this although it sometimes fixes itself.  This is part of the reason boot loaders like grub keep old versions of the kernel as startup menu options.\n\nA: No.\nUnless you seldom do updates, and then do a large number (eg. monthly).  Then it is prudent to re-start, etc.\n\nA: You should restart when kernel updates, or when driver was updated. Otherwise kernel or driver update won't work until reboot.\n\nA: I would say for security updates you should depending upon the severity of the vulnerabilities that the updates resolve. \n", "Q: How can launchers be added to and removed from the Unity dash? Scenario #1: Manually removing launchers\nI installed a few games from the recent Humble Indie Bundle and removed them today.\nThe games which were installed using a deb were successfully uninstalled and removed from the dash, however, the games that I installed using the .run format are still in my menu and dash even after uninstalling them... how do I remove those items?\nScenario #2: Adding custom launchers\nI have created Wine shortcuts to card games on my Windows partition.  I added these launchers in alacarte (Menu Editor) and they worked fine in Classic Gnome, however they are not appearing in the Games section of the Unity dash. Is it possible to add launchers for these games to the dash, or do I have to add the launchers to the desktop?\n\nA: Don't know about scenario 1, haven't any HIB games, - I'd look thru any of the  possible places - /usr/local/share;` ~/.local/share; /opt/\nAs far as 2 - try opening the .desktop you created in a text editor (your launcher is just a .desktop), & add   a Categories= line\nSomething like this should suffice - \nCategories=Game;\n\nTypically game .desktops use this but the above should be ok\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Game;\n\nA log out/in  should show in Dash filter > games, if not then re-open the launcher in your text editor & try adding a %U to end of the Exec= line leaving a space after what's currently there. (shouldn't be needed in these cases\n\nA: Dash launchers are located in either /usr/share/applications/ or $HOME/.local/share/applications and have a .desktop extensions. To remove from the dash just delete the corresponding .desktop file from either of these folders. To add a launcher just create a new text document, save it with a suitable name (NAME.desktop) in one of those folders and here is a sample of what needs to go in it from the Chess game launcher file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Chess\nComment=Play the classic two-player boardgame of chess\nVersion=1.0\nExec=/usr/games/glchess\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=GNOME;Game;BoardGame;\nStartupNotify=true\nIcon=gnome-glchess\nMimeType=application/x-chess-pgn;\nG    enericName=3D Chess Game\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Bugzilla=GNOME\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Product=gnome-games\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=BugBuddyBugs\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Version=3.2.1\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gnome-games\n\n\nA: In the dash type in Main Menu and run that application. Find the launchers created. Since these are from HIB they are probably are under the Games section. You can either uncheck the check box to hide the launcher entries or delete them.\nIf you are unable to find the launchers there they may be inside your ~/.local/share/applications/ folder.\n", "Q: Why can't I access Windows from Grub after installing Ubuntu? I'm new to Ubuntu and just installed it on my HP Compaq nx5000. I dual-boot installed with Windows XP. When I boot, it goes to the grub bootloader. At the bottom of the Grub list it says boot Windows XP professional. But when I select the last one and press enter, no matter how many times I try, it either loads Ubuntu or goes back to the bootloader.\n\nA: Use Boot-Repair, Boot-Repair is a one-click solution that detects currently installed operating systems and updates grub configuration.\n\nA: On Ubuntu open up the Terminal (if you don't know how, open the Dash launcher and type terminal).\nIn the terminal window type this in:\nsudo update-grub2\n\nIt will ask for your user password (the one you use to login to Ubuntu). Type it in and press enter.\nAfter that some text will come up in the terminal (it should be pretty similar to the text you get on the grub boot menu screen). After a minute, when the command stops restart and try loading Windows XP again.  Tell us if it works.\n", "Q: Can I legally build and sell desktops with Ubuntu pre-installed? I'm starting a business and this is part of what I'm going to be offering. I'm almost complete with my certification in Linux Administration, but I don't know all of the ins and outs of the law Linux is under...\n\nA: It depends. Ubuntu is free software (beyond some redistributable binary blobs), but if you're using it for commercial purposes there are trademark restrictions.\nThe Legal Fine Print\n\nPermission from us is necessary to use any of the Trademarks under any circumstances other than those specifically permitted above. These include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Any commercial use. OEM services. [...]\n  \n*Use for merchandising purposes, e.g. on t-shirts and the like.\n  \n*Use of a name which includes the letters BUNTU in relation to computer hardware or software.\n  \n  \n  Source: Ubuntu Trademark Policy\n\nHardware with a debranded Ubuntu OS\nIf you remove all branding, trademarks, and references to Ubuntu, you are legally okay to sell systems with it installed. Of course, you must provide the source code of all GPL components to customers that request it.\nHardware shipping with Ubuntu \"as is\"\nTo use the Ubuntu trademark, you must secure the Canonical's OEM services team's  permission. You can contact them to see if what you're doing is okay. This should not be too difficult, as several small vendors like System76 and ZaReason have secured an agreement.\n\nA: Selling computers with Ubuntu pre-installed is actually not as clear-cut as others have explained. You should read the Ubuntu trademark policy specifically the parts under \"Restricted use that requires a trademark licence\". Note for example \n\nPermission from us is necessary to use any of the Trademarks under any\n  circumstances other than those specifically permitted above. \n  These include: \n  Any commercial use.\n\nSelling a computer with Ubuntu pre-installed is \"commercial use\".\n\nA: It is completely legal to sell a computer with Ubuntu preinstalled. It even lowers the cost.\nIt is also legal to sell CDs/DVDs with Ubuntu in them.\nIn both is legal because you are not selling Ubuntu, you are selling the hardware that comes with it. In the case of the PC, you are selling all that hardware that comes with Ubuntu so the end user does not need to worry about the many problems in Windows (Or the costs in Mac).\nWith the CD/DVD, you are selling the cost that you had to pay to have the CD/DVD. Burning the CD/DVD also has a cost as well as having a design printed on the CD/DVD.\nIf you worry about this, what you need to know is that the only thing illegal here is to charge directly for Ubuntu as it would something you made.\nThe laws of Freedom explicitly state:\n\n\n*\n\n*Freedom to run the program  \n\n*Freedom to access the code  \n\n*Freedom to redistribute the program to anyone  \n\n*Freedom to improve the software \n\n\nThese are freedoms oriented to what you can do with information, not how the information got to you. So charging for a CD of Ubuntu that you downloaded, burned, made a printing design on it, put on a plastic cover that you also bought with that nice logo you wanted to use is totally okay. Same goes for that computer you bought in pieces, assembled them, install Ubuntu and upgraded it. Installed additional tools for the end user. Tested the PC for 2 days to make sure it was perfect for your buyer. And then sold it to the buyer is also OK. You are actually charging for the work you put to offer this to the end user. Your client.. and after having Ubuntu installed in it he/she would be.. your happy client.\nTo give you a better feeling about this, you can see as companies like Dell, Asus and others sell Laptops with Ubuntu installed. Several universities offer CD/DVD with Ubuntu in them for a low price. Even events like Flisol offer installing Ubuntu (In this case free) since they can install it directly to the client or with a cost if they need to give out a CD/DVD of it (Of course since most of us pitch in, the cost of the CD/DVD for the new users is free).\nUPDATE - AS mentioned by popey, there are a couple of things you need to read:\nOEM Services (Read the WHOLE thing) - http://www.canonical.com/engineering-services/oem-services/oem-services\nTrademark Policy - http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy\nFor the trademark, as long as you do not use a extensively modified version of Ubuntu (Extensive as in changing the directory structure, modifying many basic tools and programs, changing names, etc) you will not have a problem with the trademark. In your case where you only mention the installation and configuration of Ubuntu you won't have problems with this.\nUPDATE 2 - As mentioned by drewbenn in his comment here is a good link about this: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#DoesTheGPLAllowMoney which complements the rest mentioned in the answer.\n\nA: Vanilla Ubuntu: You should be fine.\nBut if you install some more software on to it, like proprietary software you are not allowed to distribute, then maybe not.\n\nA: Dell and Christmann (just to name a few) do what's asked in the first question. So yes it is legal to install Ubuntu and then sell the Computer - as long as you don't charge for something you don't have the rights to.\nMy University did sell CDs with Ubuntu on them. So yes, that's legal too.\n\nA: I think Ubuntu is mostly GPL software, so the right to distribute it can't be restricted by license or trademark policy. \nSo you can install Ubuntu on an assembled PC, and it can't be prohibited to sell it. Now as a dealer, you have to inform your customer what you want to sell them. So it can't be prohibited to tell them, what you've installed on the hardware. \nOf course in your acting you have to avoid the impression that you're acting in the name of Ubuntu, as part of the company behind Ubuntu or using their logo. \nHowever, as a nice guy, I would tell them what I want to do. \n\nA: Linux is protected both under copyright law and trademark law, as is Ubuntu. The GPL and similar Open source licenses give specific permission to copy Ubuntu software, as required by copyright law. \nThat leaves you with trademarks. Under the doctrine of nominative use, you are specifically allowed to use the Ubuntu trademark to describe Ubuntu. Trademarks are intended to signal that your customers get the \"real deal\" and not something that's just similar to Ubuntu.\nYou may not over-use the Ubuntu trademark. I.e. you cannot suggest that your hardware is also part of Ubuntu, that Ubuntu is optimzied for your hardware, or use their logo.\nJacob Johan Edwards suggests that Canonical imposes restrictions on the commercial use of the Ubuntu trademark. However, federal law does not give Canonical the right to impose restrictions on the legal use of trademarks.\n\nA: It's possible...but you have to check that you are shipping your machine with proprietary software...If so then you have to get permission from respective owners...\n\nA: You can sell machines with Ubuntu pre-installed ,but you are not able to charge your customers for the operating system.\n\nA: I don't know what they are trying to say but as a linux user as well as developer I ensure you one thing There are some distribution of unix os that are made free for everyone and many struggled for this. So, I suggest use any of the free distribution and I request not to charge for the os but its up to you.\n", "Q: No prompt after successful ssh login After a successful login to my VPS the command prompt doesn't get displayed. I've ran ssh with -vvv and sshd with debug output, absolutely nothing is amiss.\nThe VPS is Ubuntu 11.04, the client Ubuntu 11.10, sitting behind a router. The strange thing is my laptop (also Ubuntu 11.10) behind that same router connects and gets the command prompt no problem.\n/var/log/auth output is here \nssh -vvv output is here\nSince the laptop gets the command prompt without issues, I'm guessing the problem is with my desktop. Can I do like a flush of everything ssh related in case I screwed something up? I've tried deleting ~/.ssh/knownhosts but that didn't do it.\n\nA: Not sure if this is the same issue I saw, but on Ubuntu they require bash to be run in login mode to set the prompt, as such unless you have login=yes in the sshd_config you will not get a prompt.\n\nA: For the sake of others that end up with similar problems, here is another solution:\nOur embedded system was allowing ssh connections, but was not giving a shell prompt. By setting the logging output to DEBUG3 in sshd_config and checking the /var/log/messages, we were able to determine that the ssh server was going to pause for about 100 years!\nOur embedded system never initialised its clock, so it thought it was 1917. Because the ssh client message was from the future, the server was waiting for its own time to catch up to it. We resolved the problem by setting the time (using date) and restarting the server (using /etc/init.d/sshd restart).\n\nA: I have the same problem on an embedded device. The problem was that /dev/pts was not mounted.\nsudo mount -t devpts none /dev/pts\n\n\nA: Once you're logged in, do echo \"$PS1\" | od -bc. Your prompt, PS1 (assuming bash) is set by your startup scripts. Where do you set up your prompt? Perhaps you need to add your PS1 definition to ~/.ssh/environment or ~/.ssh/rc on the target. See man ssh and man sshd.\n\nA: Solved it. ufw was acting out. Although sudo ufw status returns \"disabled\", running sudo ufw disable fixed it. I haz no explanation for it, after wasting way too much time with this I'm just happy it works.\n\nA: If you running sshd as a systemd managed process, then after making any changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config you must execute systemctl restart sshd for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: I solved this by removing the option -T from the ssh command\n", "Q: How to add apps that doesn't appear on dash home to launcher? Today I've spent all day trying to fix an Ubuntu 11.04 but I failed. I didn't wanted to upgrade one step further because I am trying to avoid Unity, but I had to recover that PC so I installed 11.10, now after a few hours I am not hating it so much, I kinda like it but I still don't quite understand some things.\nFor example, I found I was able to drag and drop apps from the dash home results to the left bar and they will get \"sticked\" there, but later I installed VirtualBox, which doesn't appear on dash home results (but if I type it on a console it does launch fine).\nSo how could I add VirtualBox to the left bar when I can't find it on dash home search results to drag and drop it? I don't just want to add the main VirtualBox to the bar, but also the virtual machines shortcut, like I use to do in previous Ubuntu versions by just adding an application launcher to the menu.\n\nA: The virtualbox icon will appear in the launcher on the side when you launch the application in Terminal, correct? If so, right-click the Virtualbox icon and click \"Keep in Launcher\".\n", "Q: How do I get Samba and CUPS installed onto Ubuntu Unity 11.10 and recognize my network printers I have a HP930C printer installed on an older machine with Windows 2000.  I had it working up Ubuntu 9.10 and also have a network printer Lexmark X7600 on a wired LAN connection.\nI was able to get them working with SAMBA and was able to print to them.  I won't hook the Lexmark to work with WiFi because of security concerns.\n\nA: By default Ubuntu lets you install local or network printers. Just open Printers from the system dropdown menu on the top right:\n\nIn the configuration window choose Add to add a new printer\n\nTo add a network printer choose this in the next window\n\nThe selection depends on the method your printer share is set up on the printer server. This may be SAMBA on the Windows side but also other protocols are supported. See also this answer on how to set up a shared network printer in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Ubuntu likely ships with the necessary packages. If not, make sure you install smbclient, libsmbclient, samba and maybe even system-config-samba. Ubuntu 9.10 is no longer supported so you might have trouble accessing these packages in the package manager in Ubuntu 9.10, it's best to install the latest version, but I guess if you're patient enough you could wait it out until the next LTS is released.\n", "Q: can't run or install Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition Before this I had run ubuntu 10.04 netbook edition on my Lenovo s10-3c but I just figure out ubuntu 10.10 is a newes ubuntu for netbook.So I just download the ISO Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition.But here is my problem I can't run it or install it on my netbook.It's just came out Ubuntu boot logo and  I wait for 10 minutes but nothing happen.Can someone help me in this problem??\n\nA: Ubuntu no longer makes the netbook edition because its Unity interface has been included with mainstream Ubuntu, meaning the default Ubuntu is for netbooks, too. It's always recommended to install the latest version of Ubuntu, especially if you're running relatively new hardware. You'll likely have better luck with Ubuntu 11.10 than with 10.10. \nLooks like a lot of users reported that their keyboard doesn't work in older versions of Ubuntu (seems to work if you include the noacpi = off boot parameter), though you haven't mentioned a keyboard issue. I recommend running Ubuntu 11.10, at least try a live session to see if it works. After installing Ubuntu if Brasero is still installed you can remove it to make it more like the Netbook edition was (unless you're considering burning discs using an external disc drive).\n", "Q: update-alternative command not found I want to run the following:\nsudo update-alternative --config java\n\nHowever, the update-alternative command is not found.

Then go a head and point your ERRFILE to /dev/null IE. Line 83\nexec >> /dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nA: In case you still need a solution that keeps logs and has a proper rotation (as it should be for any logged data).\nHere is my approach:\nreplace\nexec >>\"$ERRFILE\" 2>&1\n\nwith\nexec > >(logger -t xsession-$USER) 2>&1\n\nin the /etc/X11/Xsession file\nThat will send all logs to the local syslog server, which can send the logs to the /var/log/syslog file by default and have proper logrotate rules\nAlternatively, you can route these messages to a separate file, using syslog configuration and have separate logrotate rules for it altogether.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nexecute with sudo\n\n*\n\n*cd to user folder\n\n\n*create new .xsession-errors file e.g.\necho  test>.xsession-errors\n\n\n*chmod 000 .xsession-errors\n\n\n*Add immutable attribute - even root will not be able write to the file\nchattr +i .xsession-errors\n\nA: I found an interim solution.\nI put a small script in /etc/X11/Xsession.d called 91redirect-xsession-errors that does the job for now, but if you want to have your own custom symlink for .xession-errors it does not work for that (I tried and it did not output any data).\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Redirect $HOME/.xsession-errors to /dev/null.\n# BJEM 11 January 2012\n\nXSESSION_ERRFILE=$HOME/.xsession-errors\n\n# This does not seem to work for a regular file,\n# i.e. if you want to symlink $HOME/.xsession-errors\n# to another file.  I do not know why.\nXSESSION_ERRFILE_FINAL=/dev/null\n\n# Creates target file if it does not exist.\ntouch \"$XSESSION_ERRFILE_FINAL\"\n\n# Link .xsession-errors file to the desired target\n# no matter what.\nln -sf \"$XSESSION_ERRFILE_FINAL\" \"$XSESSION_ERRFILE\"\n\n# Test case.\n#gedit &\n\n##### END OF FILE #####\n\nIt's a bit 'rough and ready' but it does the job for me.  Note that this is the only file that has been altered.\n\nA: I was able to recover the disk space using truncate.\nIf you want to limit the space used for logging, you could do this in a loop or cron. For diagnostic purposes, it might be worthwhile to tail the file before truncating.\nOptional: Use a hard-link to create a second filename for .xsession-errors in case, for some reason, truncate replaces the file without actually truncating the underlying file (this way you won't lose access to the file if it becomes unlinked without being deleted/truncated).\nmkdir --parents .xsession-errors.backup\ntail --lines=10000 .xsession-errors >$(mktemp --tmpdir=. .xsession-errors.backup/XXXXXX)\nln .xsession-errors .xsession-errors.truncate\ntruncate --size=0 .xsession-errors.truncate\nrm --force .xsession-errors.truncate\n\n\nBased on the explanation at What is xsession-errors?, these log items are not necessarily system related. It could be some individual application that has gone into a death loop. You can find out which application by looking for the PID at the start of the log lines. Then you probably just want to kill it.\n\nA: This issue follows me around on Arch KDE, Neon KDE and now MX KDE. My primary concern here is that the log file is wasting my SSD writes since I like to keep up with long up-times and the issue exacerbates over time. After some days it's going to boost into overdrive and waste my writes.\n\n*\n\n*I have put this in my /etc/fstab to create a 10MB RAM drive.\n\ntmpfs   /media/mkey/tmp tmpfs   size=10000000   0       0\n\n\n\n*I have created a mkey_custom.sh script in my home directory\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntouch /media/mkey/tmp/.xsession-errors\ntouch /media/mkey/tmp/.xsession-errors.old\n\nln -sf /media/mkey/tmp/.xsession-errors /home/mkey/.xsession-errors\nln -sf /media/mkey/tmp/.xsession-errors.old /home/mkey/.xsession-errors.old\n\n\n\n*I have created a mkey_custom.service file\n\n[Unit]\nDescription=mkey custom service\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/bin/bash /home/mkey/mkey_custom.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=basic.target\n\n\n\n*Finally, to install and run the service I used the following\n\ncp mkey_custom.service /etc/systemd/system/mkey_custom.service\nchmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/mkey_custom.service\nsystemctl enable mkey_custom.service\n\nI found that I needed to run the script as a service as running it during startup would be too late. The OS would already start writing to the /home location, so any redirects at that point were in vain.\nIf after a reboot I check the /home/mkey/.xsession-errors file properties I will see that it now points to right where I want it /media/mkey/tmp/.xsession-errors and that it's being written to.\n\nA: I faced same problem in redhat linux 6.4 server but i can find which folder or user takes more space by using this command \"find / -xdev -type f -size +100000000c -exec ls -lh {} \\;\" then i deleted manually x session errors by using rm -rf command\n", "Q: No TV Out or S-Video out with Intel GM965 Graphics I have in the past on the same laptop been able to get TV out and S-Video out working, but now I cannot do it.

Getting TV-out worked off the live cd.\n\nA: My patch would break tvout support for other cards so I won't submit it as a patch. I can say I found the problem and have locally fixed it. In the kernel code there is kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_tv.c that has a function called intel_tv_init( struct drm_device *dev) at the line +-1550. In there the driver checks for tv outyness. If you look at the function, there are many points at which the init can fail.  My asus A51e failed in the checking vbts section. through the miracle of slash slash based optimisation, I removed that check and now I have tvout working on the laptop with 3.2.x I will check if it works with 3.11+.\nYou need to get the kernel code from git and then apply a patch. \nremember:\ngit checkout \n\napply the fix. copy a .config from your /boot dir to your src dir\nmake -j #cpus +1\nmake -j #cpus +1 modules\nmake -j #cpus +1 modules_install \nmake -j #cpus +1 deb_pkg\ncd .. \ndpkg -i linux*.deb\n\nenjoy.\n", "Q: Is there a difference between Ubuntu Gnome-shell and Fedora Gnome-shell? I am using ubuntu 11.10 with gnome-shell installed.   I often hear people talking about the \"pure gnome-shell experience\" with regards to Fedora.\nWhat does this mean? Are there differences between the two?\n\nA: both are same but i feel it's my personal perspective it may be wrong but the gnome shell in ubuntu is more beautiful than in fedora , The fonts look rather blurred overall, not helped by the low-contrast theme. Then, you also get icons that are rendered with low quality, making the product feel cheap. i love ubuntu and with gnome 3 shell it is the best one\n\nA: Fedora have packages that are much more recent than the offered in Ubuntu, that's why I prefer Fedora. The icons and fonts are Gnome ones, and the packages are much more integrated. But even Fedora doesn't come with Web (Gnome's default web browser, Epiphany Browser), it comes with Firefox. I prefer Web and always have to install it. Some say that Gnome plans to make a distro, that will sove that question, but i prefer the idea of having at install of Fedora, a option called something like \"Pure Gnome\", that gives the user only the full Gnome experience.\n", "Q: How to findout web history in ubuntu? I have gifted my 15yrs son a Dell laptop in which Ubuntu 10.10 has pre installed,\nwanna trace what whether he is using the net in proper way or not.\nPlease suggest me how to findout what he browsing online.\nDo we have any tool to findout search history for 15days what he did ?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: In Firefox, use ctrl-shift-H or menu History - Show All. Other browsers will have similar options but he can configure the browser to delete this info or delete manually himself so it's a very basic check and easily fooled if he knows you will check.\n\nA: Where are you trying to record this information?  Unless you can record it in a place he can't access or want to resort to a whole bunch of data forensics the answer is no.\n\nA: Well, Firefox provides a feature called Private Mode, which is specifically designed not to store any such information. I would not bet anything on the assumption that your son doesn't know about it. There is no network log in Ubuntu (by default) that you can check. You could install an application to do that, if you really wanted to, but that would also only work as long as he didn't have any direct access to the system. \nI would not rely on the computer to reveal his habits. At home, you could make a router store the network traffic, but I don't think computers are the solution to this problem. \n\nA: I would recommend Net Responsibility for this. I was the initial developer of it several years ago, though it's now been rewritten by the new maintainers and I don't know the details of how it works. But here's basically what it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, it monitors all the URLs requested at a low level (so that you can't get around it by switching browsers or using the private browsing mode.\n\n*Then, it periodically sends reports to the accountability partner (in this case, you). I think that the way the reports work has been changed since I worked on it, so I no longer no too many details, but the reports do include a list of the websites visited.\n\n*Finally, it includes in the reports whether it's been shut down manually (as an anti-circumvention measure). And, of course, if you don't get a report when scheduled, you'd know that it had been disabled.\n\n\nI don't recommend using this software as a way to sneak around. Make it clear to him up front that the software is there and that if he tampers with it he'll lose his computer privileges.\nFinally, if you want to prevent tampering, don't give him a full account on the machine. Either give him a non-administrator account, or configure sudo to prevent access to Net Responsibility. The latter option isn't easy to implement, though.\n", "Q: Install penetration tool on Ubuntu 11.10 How to install penetration tool on my Ubuntu 11.10 from Blackbuntu or Backtrack source and fugure out it's work or not.thank for helping\n\nA: Blackbuntu is a distribution changing quite a lot of ubuntu. But you can look to their tool list to see what packages they are using:\nhttp://www.blackbuntu.com/tools-list\nAfter you see a tool you are interested to, google it - e,g, \"ubuntu install httprint\".\nAnother way of using Blackbuntu is to install virtualbox and run a blackbuntu instance within a virtual pc.

I'm working on an installer script for the latest ATI drivers (as they are not in repo) and was wondering if I need to include sudo in the script, because it will be needed for the install.\n\nA: no, if you need root privileges you call the script with sudo.\n\nA: All commands in a script are run as the calling user. So if I write this script:\n\n/home/user/my_script\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"I am running as root\" > /root/status.txt\n\n\nI can successfully produce a file containing \"I am running as root\" at /root/status.txt by executing either:\nuser@host$ sudo /home/user/my_script\n\nOr as the superuser:\nroot@host$ /home/user/my_script\n\n", "Q: Why isn't my custom launcher working?

My PC has a AMD Phenom X4 955 processor, 4 GB ram and AMD HD 6950 graphics card.\nSo its not that slow, but the windows (Nautilus, Firefox - just about any window really) move very sluggishly. I tried it with the AMD driver that Ubuntu provides (FGLRX driver, the standard, not the newest) and without it. I have installed Compiz Config and disabled the vsync, and also tried to switch vsync in the catalyst drivers on and off. Nothing seems to work.\nSometimes the window movement is perfectly smooth for a moment, then it gets slow as hell again. the other effects like minimizing are working very smooth.

It's really annoying.\n\nA: You should install the latest drivers for your card, they give so much better support than the ones included on the Ubuntu repos.\nIf you need any help to install the ATI drivers on your system have a look at this question Is my ATI graphics card supported in Ubuntu? It will help you download and install the latest drivers in your system.\nThe included drivers (fglrx 11.08 and fglrx 11.09) in the Ubuntu repos are not really the best ones to fully appreciate Unity, only after the upgrade to fglrx 11.11 had I a good experience with it, no more slowness and hanging windows and movies. All worked much, much better.\nThe guide I included will install fglrx 11.12, they are the current latest drivers from ATI.\n", "Q: How do I migrate an Ubuntu installation to a home folder partition? I have two partitions of Ubuntu installed on my Samsung N150 Plus. One is 11.04 (90GB) and one is 11.10 (60GB). All my documents are on the 11.04 home folder, but they are too big to cut and paste into 11.10.\nI would like to remove the OS from 11.04 and use that partition as my home folder in 11.10. Any easy step-by-step guide on how to do this would be appreciated.\nNOTE: I have a cracked screen, and cannot always see what's on the screen of my Samsung; nothing displays on my external monitor until I've already booted.\n\nA: Edit: one important step was missing.\nThe following procedure should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the system files of 11.04 (warning: this will remove all programs and data that are not in your home folder)\na. In 11.10, open a terminal\nb. Run sudo nautilus\nc. Mount the 11.04 partition\nd. Delete everything except your home folder from that partition\n\n*Update grub\na. Now, run sudo update-grub\nb. Reboot\n\n*If you have any files in the 11.10 home, move it to the other partition (the one that was 11.04)\n\n*Move the personal folders to the partition root. In the partition that will be your home folder, you need to move the folders to the partition root. If you have /media/DISK-ID/home/user, you need to move it to /media/DISK-ID/user.\na. Open a terminal and run cd /media/YOUR-DISK-ID/home\nb. Move everything from here to the parent folder: sudo mv * ..\nc. Remove the empty home folder: cd .. ; sudo rmdir home\n\n*Update you fstab\na. Run sudo df -h\nb. See the partition name of the your new home (it must be something like /dev/sdaX where X is a number)\nc. Run sudo gedit /etc/fstab\nd. Add the following line to it:\n/dev/sdaX /home           ext4    defaults        0       0\ne. Reboot\n\nA: Removing the 11.04 installation is quite simple. You'll just log onto 11.10, mount the root filesystem of the other installation and delete everything except the home directory. Then you'll edit your grub menu to not include it. Afterwards, you can copy your data from the home folder of 11.10 onto the one from 11.04, and then use that filesystem as a home folder in 11.10. \n", "Q: Custom Ubuntu Server Install I'm just about to get a new tower server which I'm going to put ubuntu server on.\nThe problem is the server doesn't have an optical drive. - I could take one out of an old machine I have, but it may be easier to install from a USB disk?

Write it to a usb, and it will boot. It will download the packages it need from the central repository.\n\nA: I am assuming that you have another desktop computer/laptop, and that it is Ubuntu 11.10? If so, There is a program called Ubuntu Customization Kit available in the Ubuntu Software Center; install that by searching for \"uck\". You will need to download the ISO image (from http://ubuntu.com/download) for the install you wish to customize. Follow the instructions within uck. This is not a task for a noob (as you have indicated) though, as most of the customizing needs to be done through the terminal. I would not know which files could be safely removed. The deb files are stored in /pool/main and are sorted alphabetically, not categorically. It would be difficult to know which files are dependencies for other packages. And... I believe that if you are customizing 64-bit server, you would need to use 64-bit Ubuntu Desktop. Should you choose this bumpy route, here is a decent tutorial: http://fabrizioballiano.net/2007/11/27/remastering-an-ubuntu-alternate-iso-with-ubuntu-customization-kit-the-complete-guide/ IMHO, I would either put the hard drive from the proposed server into the old (functioning?) computer and install, or (best option) move the optical drive to the server. 5 minutes of time compared to 5 hours+ of paring and testing.\n", "Q: How to get an Aero feel in Ubuntu?

After some trouble getting the bridged network adapter installed on win7, I wanted to check network access to and from the vm. Verified that I could hit the vm's web server from the host, and wanted to test that I could also hit the internet from the vm, so I did this on the shell cmd line:\ncurl www.google.com\n\nWhich responded with this:\n-sh: curl: not found\n\nWanting to make sure it wasn't busted networking, I tried this, and got the same response:\ncurl localhost\n\nThat leads me to think that wasn't curl saying it can't find the requested url, but the shell saying it can't find the curl cmd. So I did this:\nsudo apt-get install curl\n\nResponse was:\n-sh: sudo: not found\n\nSo now I'm confused. Sudo has to be installed, doesn't it, and apt-get? Both because they're fundamental I think, and because you couldn't install anything else without them, if you see what I mean.\nIs it a security issue, that my account (which I just created via webmin) doesn't have rights to sudo? I added myself to the secondary group 'sudo' via webmin, though I wasn't sure that was legit, logged out and back in, no change, so I undid it.\nI read that /etc/sudoers controls access to sudo, but as far as I can tell from both the cmd line and the webmin text editor open file dlg, it doesn't exist. Do I need to create it? Is it normal to have to do that, or a system defect?\nOr is it something else that my ignorant self is or isn't doing?\n\nA: Whilst Turnkey Linux is based on Ubuntu (and is binary compatible - and in fact is mostly constructed of vanilla Ubuntu packages), it isn't strictly Ubuntu and has a number of customisations.\nSo sudo is not installed by default in TKL appliances. On a desktop it is a really good idea to have the root account disabled and use sudo instead (as Ubuntu is by default). IMO (and the TKL dev's) this rationale does not apply to servers.\nWith this setup sudo is generally not required. For general admin just use root (and so no need for sudo). If you want additional users you probably don't want them having admin (sudo) privileges anyway.\nSo to install curl (or any other command) just omit the sudo eg\napt-get install curl\n\nIf you want sudo then just install it\n apt-get install sudo\n\n\nA: Probably your PATH is wrong. sudo is located in /usr/bin folder. Try to run the complete path:\n/usr/bin/sudo -i\nThen:\napt-get install curl\nIs there any special reason to use sh instead of bash?\n\nA: from this forum post \nhttp://www.turnkeylinux.org/forum/support/20110125/sudo-command-not-found-turnkeylinux-drupal6\nit looks like, sudo isn't installed by default on turnkeylinux.\nIt features some help on how to install it as well.\nIf there are more problems with turnkey you should probably continue to ask there, since it seems to be a heavily specialized ubuntu fork.\n\nA: Could you try the command?\nsudo -i\n\nIt should ask you for your password and then log you in as root user.\nIf it works type\nexit\n\nto log yourself out again.\nThat would verify that you have sudo rights.\n", "Q: How can I edit php.ini? I am using lamp on my computer for development only. The problem is that I cannot make any changes to it because the owner is root. How could I change the permissions to it?\n\nA: Changing the ownership and permissions of system files is not a good idea and can result in this particular case you may be able to \"get away\" with this change, in general changing ownership and permissions on system files is asking for problems ranging from security to system failures.\nYou should edit the files as root\n# Command line\nsudo -e /path/to/php.ini\n\n# Graphical\ngksu gedit /path/to/php.ini\n\nIf you do not have root access talk to your system administrator.\nSee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for further information.\n\nA: You can change the owner of file once and then make changes to it as you do to any other file you own. You need to run:\nsudo chown user /path/to/your/file/php.ini\nWhere user is your username.\nTo make sure any user on system can read (but not edit it):\nchmod 644 /path/to/your/file/php.ini\n\nA: I assume you're working/testing a particular application and need the PHP configuration to be changed for that, and in this case you can simply \"Sudo\" edit that.\nIf you installed a stack version using either Tasksel or aptitude, the wollowing will work\n\nsudo nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n\nIf you like you can use gedit as well.\nHowever, if you want to edit/make frequent changes, you can change the file ownership to the userid you use during your development.\nYou can use,\n\nsudo chown oli_dev /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n\noli_dev being your user name \nand \n/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini being your primary php configuration file.\nIn case you're unsure of the php.ini file used by your interpreter, \nuse phpinfo() inside a test script and call it in browser. It should help you locate the configuration file loaded.\nHope this helps, plz do revert if you need more assistance.\nCheers!\n\nA: My solution was:\nphp -i | grep php.ini\n\nto find the file, and then\nsudo vim /path/to/your/file/php.ini\n\nYou may also need to edit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini or if you're using nginx (which I doubt) vim /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini\nhit / to search, enter uploadmaxfilesize and Enter. Get the pointer to the corresponding value that's set there and hit i. Delete/Backspace away the value and change it to what you want it to be. Then hit esc. Continue with search until you've properly edited the file.\nThen hit :wq to save the file and exit\nthen restart the whole system to make sure changes apply.\n\nA: Same problem here, and as I'm not used to Linux I asked for help and the solution is quite simple. Better than change file's permissions is to edit the file from console making a sudo to change your permissions to root.\nSo, you open a task console and put:\n$ cd /etc/php/7.2/apache2/ <-- assuming this is the path for php.ini. Check PHPInfo().\n$ sudo -i \n\nHere you will be prompted to enter your user's password. And after this you've become root user. \n# nano php.ini\n\nAnd now add/remove your configuration, save your changes, restart Apache and exit from root account:\n# exit\n\n", "Q: SSH shell launched using \"expect\" doesn't have full width. How can I make fix it?

This is what you want.\nNext push the public key to the server.\n$ ssh-copy-id root@111.222.333.255\n\nFinally create a launcher with the command:\ngnome-terminal -t SSH1 -x ssh root@111.222.333.255\n\n\nA: This has to do with the environment variable that Expect uses for your terminal setting.\nThis can easily be fixed by adding the following line to the beginning of your Expect script:\nset ::env(TERM) vt100\n\nI found that if you have any colorized characters.  If you want to see colorized characters, you can also try:\nset ::env(TERM) xterm\n\n\nA: Add this to your code:\ntrap {\n    set XZ [stty rows   ]\n    set YZ [stty columns]\n    stty rows $XZ columns $YZ < $spawn_out(slave,name)\n} WINCH\n\nThis appears to be working for me on Ubuntu 17.10\n", "Q: switch between 3g and 2g in zte modem I'm relatively new to Ubuntu(installed 11.10 just 2 days ago).\nThe thing is that if I connect my zte mf691 modem via usb it shows up in connection manager.

Next run this command in terminal to get your device detected immediately: sudo usb_modeswitch -H -c 19d2:1201\n\n*If your device uses a username, password and dial number for authentication, you'll have to do these steps in wvdial. In terminal run sudo wvdialconf\n\n*Now edit the generated configuration file to input your authentication info by executing gksudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf (add your username, password and dial number and don't forget to remove the semi-colons in order to uncomment them!!)\n\n*Now do this graphically: Network Manager>Edit Connections..., then Mobile Broadband>Add, and add your modem. Once added, go to Edit to input your user name, password and dial number for authentication). Afterwards you should be able to connect from the Network Manager.\n\n*Also, always boot with the modem connected. Otherwise you may have to run the modprobe command again (that's sudo usb_modeswitch -H -c 19d2:1201\nThese instructions are based on past experience with the CDMA modems I configured in Mali, which I documented on my personal wiki.\n\nA: The easiest way to select the network which you need from the 3rd party software's settings( Hybrid, 1x,etc are the words in the software to mention 2g and 3g).

I'm using Banshee 2.2.1 on Ubuntu 11.10. When I tried to import my music library, which I\nmade by ripping CDs with Windows Media Player, only two albums retained their information. The rest (about 300 songs) were dumped into the unknown artist, unknown album folder. All of them have names and some have genre information. The two albums mentioned retained everything: artist, album, names, art, etc. I am not completely sure with what I ripped these albums.\n\nA: If you select the Unknown Album of the Unknown Artist, Banshee will display the corresponding track-list (which should contain all the unidentified tracks you imported).\n\nSelect all the unknown tracks which you believe belong to a same album (using shift+left-click or ctrl+left-click), then right-click to get the context-menu. In this menu you will choose Edit Track Information:\n\nYou will then see an Edit Track Information dialogue, where you will be able to edit your metadata manually:\n\nThere are also plug-ins to fix metadata.\n\nA: Try using EasyTag, it is a ver easy to use metadata manager/editor. You can edit many files in one step. I have around 3000 music files, all edited with it.\n", "Q: How do I directing sound to a remote PulseAudio server? I've configured PulseAudio server on a PC that is connected to stereo system. I've had no problems directing audio from my notebook running Ubuntu 10.10 to it - remote audio device just appeared in output device list in sound preferences. No such luck with Ubuntu 11.10 on my wife's netbook though. I've managed to enable Network Access in paprefs after symlinking /usr/lib/pulse-1.0 to /usr/lib/pulse-1.0.0, but there are no remote sound devices in sound preferences, padevchooser is removed in this release and pavucontrol doesn't see any remote devices either. Can this be fixed or is pulseaudio network features are indeed considered 'unneeded' in newer Ubuntu releases?\nAdditional details: PULSE_SERVER environment variable does work, but that's not convenient enough in this case to say the least; avahi-browse does see the PulseAudio server, too.\n\nA: I found a replacement for padevchooser here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~christoph-gysin/+archive/pasystray\nI haven't tried it yet, but it's supposed to make directing audio over the network possible again.\n", "Q: init error, laptop do not boot I turned my computer on and it comes up with ways to boot and I clicked Ubuntu with linux 2.6.38-13-generic.

I wanted to get a program, which is installed via bzr. \nI have successfully installed bzr, but it asks me to authenticate (despite that I`m logged in to Launchpad). Bzr help seems to be oriented towards developers, and says nothing about logging in. \nHow should a non-technical user use it? Is there a GUI?\n\nA: Bazaar is a version control system, like git or svn. It used by developers to help collaborate on a project. If your using bzr to download a program it means your getting source code which you will need to compile.\nYes there is a gui in the software centre but I think the command line would be simpler.\nWhat is the program you are trying to get and what's the bzr branch called?\nSee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control\n\nA: Since all you want is to get the program, you don't need to login with Bazaar or within Launchpad in your browser (and Bazaar doesn't (have the means to) know about this!).\nBazaar is a program that will get the (source code of the) program you want, and all the files (and steps, on README file) you need to get the program working.\nThere is a graphic front-end for Bazaar. It is called Bazaar Explorer. To read more about it see: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/explorer/en/documentation.html\n\n\nSteps you need to do now (really easy):\n\n\n*\n\n*create some directory to put files in (example: /home/you/fbuntu)\n\n*in a terminal, change to that folder (cd ~/fbuntu)\n\n*and then do the bzr command (bzr branch lp:fbuntu) --> it will warn you about Launchpad ID, but do not worry, you don't need it to get the program working! It will download all the files, and once it's done, you can open them normally.\n\nA: As far as I know and use Bazaar, it is meant for development use, to upload, download, manage versions of codes you are working on yourself or with a group of developers. Bazaar, abbreviated to bzr, is a client-side application that connects to Launchpad, where codes are stored and viewable by all.\nYou can learn basics about Bazaar on this short tutorial.\nLaunchpad is a platform created and managed by Canonical, the organisation behind Ubuntu.\nIf you are looking at downloading usable programs (as with the Ubuntu Software Centre), then you should be using apt instead. See man apt in your terminal for more info.\nIf however you are looking at downloading code to compile it yourself (how the compiling is done is specific to the code) then you can use Bazaar as explained in the doc:\n>>> bzr branch lp:name-of-branch-you-wish-to-copy ~/path/to/copy/to\n\nor\n>>> mkdir ~/path/to/copy/code/to\n>>> cd ~/path/to/copy/code/to\n>>> bzr init\n>>> bzr pull lp:name-of-branch-you-wish-to-copy\n\nIt is asking to log-in on Launchpad at this point indeed and I don't know if there is a way around that. Anyway, a Launchpad account is always a good thing if you need to ask questions or report bugs to your favorite softwares hosted there. You will need to register your Launchpad account to bzr before you are able to perform branching.\nNB: the pull command will be better than the branch command if you need to update to the latest version, branch will create a copy of the existing branch on launchpad only and subsequent use of this command will create confusion imo. Subsequent updates of the code you downloaded--if new versions are published--is done with:\n>>> cd ~/path/to/copy/code/to\n>>> bzr pull lp:name-of-branch-you-wish-to-copy\n\n\nA: Launchpad allows you to keep a branch of of your code on your public repository like how it is on github(the term used is clone). \nLogging in to Launchpad with helps pushing the code into one's own public repository in launchpad.net. \nTo login run bzr launchpad-login launchpad-id .\nTo push code into your own repository run bzr push lp:~launchpad-id/projectname/trunk\nThe bzr equivalent of git clone is bzr branch lp:projectname\nedit: adding cmdline for branching \n\nA: If all you care about is getting a copy of the code, it's pretty simple:\nbzr branch branch_url\n\nFor example, if you wanted the trunk branch for my hypothetical project \"foo\", you'd do:\nbzr branch lp:~scott.severance/foo/trunk\n\n", "Q: Monitor all incoming pings/requests I have installed Ubuntu Lucid on a VPS.

Previously I asked about the same problem in Ubuntu 11.04 with messed up drivers, but now I completely reinstalled system and updated it to latest 11.10. \nLast time, I tried using various drivers for discrete video adapter, and thus messed up whole driver system and X server. As was proposed in answer to my previous question, I installed all anew, and of course, I did not install any drivers for any cards. \nUbuntu 11.10 starts okay, with Integrated card on, like 11.04 did. Vgaswitcheroo has the same problems, though: it switches off discrete card power okay, but does not make it work as main card (by echoing DIS to it). And echoing DDIS to it, and then restarting X server results in black screen with some console lines in it, or in completely black screen.\nI did not install fglrx, ati driver or any third-party software to manipulate gpu states, because I am afraid of doing something more complicated again. So, my question is following: what else can I try to do to make the radeon work? What software could help? Is there a way to completely switch off Intel card and reinstall Ubuntu this way, so it would regard Radeon as single card without any hybrid modes?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I have the same laptop with hybrid Intel HD3000 and RadeonHD 6650 GPUs. I suspect you have probably found a workable solution in the 6 months since you posted this question, but just in case you haven't (and assuming you aren't vehemently opposed to the proprietary drivers released by AMD), the information in the following two links is extremely helpful and has worked very well on my G770.\nNOTE: From my experience, these AMD Catalyst drivers work very well when installed on kernel 3.2.0-26 or earlier; I have had and am currently attempting to work through some suspend/resume issues under 3.2.0-27 (in Unity3D -- Unity2D, Gnome-Shell, and all other DE's work flawlessly). Additionally, any time you upgrade to a new kernel version you will need to uninstall and reinstall the drivers, as the Catalyst installer creates packages specifically for the running kernel it detects. If you are running kernel 3.5, you will need to install Catalyst 12.6 rather than 12.4, which is as simple as replacing all instances of \"12.4\" with \"12.6\" when following the instructions in the first link.\nSimple Step-By-Step Driver Installation Instructions\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/printthread.php?s=c2d469eb5a578eb0871a2dfba23a0b8c&t=1930450&pp=75\nSimple Method of Driver Removal (answer #2, by bioShark)\nWhat Packages/How Do I Uninstall Propriety AMD Catalyst Driver\n", "Q: How do I enable mouseover window focusing? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I set focus follows mouse? \n\nI am trying to enable the feature where a window becomes focused (whether in foreground or background) when the mouse hovers over it.\nIn previous version of Ubuntu this was changed using System > Preferences > Windows but that option is no longer there.\nHow do I change this setting with the new Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: You need the gnome-tweak-tool to do this. Under \"Windows\" you have the option to set the mode of the window focus to mouse.\nFor 14.04 and Unity, the right tool is unity-tweak-tool. Find the feature under (name/selection=name/,): Window Management, Additional Settings,Automatic Raising=Off, Fixing Behaviour: Mouse.\n\nA: You can make this setting from the command line as well. The advantage is that you do not install a number of dependencies that go with gnome-tweak-tool.\ngconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/metacity/general/focus_mode mouse\ngconftool-2 --type boolean --set /apps/metacity/general/auto_raise true\ngconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/metacity/general/auto_raise_delay 600\n\nThe only problem with these settings is that Unity puts the menus for a window at the top of the screen, so it is difficult to use focus follows mouse as the menus may change when you move the mouse.\nfocus follow mouse works better, IMO, with kde, xfce, or gnome-shell\n", "Q: Changing the Dash button to open a lens rather than shortcuts?

I would like to know how to check which is the latest version of kernel for 12.04 so I can know when I should upgrade.\n\nA: http://packages.ubuntu.com enables you to get an overview of all supported operating systems. For instance, searching for Linux; http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=names&keywords=linux, will show that 3.2.0-8 is the current version in Precise. \nFor a commandline tool, you can use rmadison from the devscripts package. It will present results like this (skipping most): \n\njo-erlend@dev:~/$ rmadison linux\n     linux | 3.0.0.12.14 |       oneiric | amd64, i386\n     linux | 3.0.0.14.16 | oneiric-security | amd64, i386\n     linux | 3.0.0.14.16 | oneiric-updates | amd64, i386\n     linux | 3.0.0.15.17 | oneiric-proposed | amd64, i386\n     linux | 3.2.0-8.14 |       precise | source\n     linux |  3.2.0.8.8 |       precise | amd64, i386\n\n\nA: You will have to monitor kernel updates yourself by occasionally checking the ubuntuupdates.org website.\nFor the precise linux-generic package the website URL is http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/linux-generic\n", "Q: NTFS drive mounted generates huge load I've got an NTFS drive mounted and on I/O it generates huge amounts of load. I'm now running my CPU (amd fusion dual core) at 100%... both. \nMy load average is 3.47 at the moment. Anyone an idea to lower this load ? (apart from using ext4 ;) )\n\nA: High CPU usage on a linux system writing to an NTFS volume can come from a number of sources, as described on tuxera (the maintainer of ntfs-3g).  They make an optimized, comercialized version of an ntfs driver, but this isn't open-source, nor is it easily available.  If you're committed to NTFS, you're stuck with this less stream-lined ntfs-3g driver.\nhttp://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-faq/#highcpu\nAssuming you are using a recent version of ubuntu, with a recent version of ntfs-3g, then options are programs frequently reading/writing big chunks of data to the drive, application frequently accessing the drive (such as rsync), the drive being connected via a slow usb connection (possibly the usb port speed slowed down by a slow device/hub being attached), VMWare using temp files on the ntfs drive, or the drive being excessively fragmented (lots of debate around this issue, many people saying the drive shouldn't get too fragmented for linux unless you are also booting an installation of windows off of that drive).  Read the above link for more information about these and more.\nMy solution was to go to my fstab and modify the mount line to include big_writes in the options (ie: defaults,big_writes ....).  This caused it to write big chunks, rather than smaller chunks. \nDisabling samba access to the drive and shutting down python scripts accessing the drive didn't have any impact for me.\n", "Q: How do I install 3d acceleration with an Nvidia Geforce GT520? I installed Play on Linux, and it said 3d acceleration wasn't installed so I downloaded an app called 3d acceleration but when I clicked on it it came back XDriInfo returned with non-zero exit code.

I configure it how I like and install my broadcom sta driver and then remaster it so I have it all there during a liveusb boot.  http://lkubuntu.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/relinux-a-way-to-create-a-bootable-iso-out-of-your-system/\n\nA: Apparently the answer is on the Ubuntu Community Wiki: WifiDocs Driver bcm43xx, b43 - No Internet Access. If you need the driver installed in the live session, you can make a USB drive bootable with a live session in persistent mode (meaning it saves your changes to the session), that should keep driver configurations.\nIf you do not have any other means of Internet access on your computer, you will have to install b43-fwcutter and patch packages from the install media. After that you will need to setup firmware manually (without the firmware automatically downloading and being set up).\nStep 1.\nb43-fwcutter is located on the Ubuntu install media under ../pool/main/b/b43-fwcutter/ and patch is located under ../pool/main/p/patch/ or both in the official repositories online.\nNote: In some versions (10.04 and 11.04 at least) there is not a /pool/main/p/patch/ If this file is missing then you don't need it. In this case you only need to install /pool/main/b/b43-fwcutter by following the instructions below.\nDouble click on the package to install or in a terminal (under the desktop menu Applications > Accessories > Terminal) navigate to the folder containing the package and issue the following command:\n\n:/b43-fwcutter/$ sudo dpkg -i b43-fwcutter*\n\nIn case you couldn't find the folder, wubi keeps it as a hidden folder so you have to mount it. Follow these steps:\n\n~$ sudo mount -o loop /host/ubuntu/install/.fuse_hidden0000000400000001 /mnt\n~$ cd /mnt/pool/main/b/b43-fwcutter/\n~$ sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter\n~$ sudo dpkg -i b43-fwcutter*\n\nAs for the patch:\n\n~$ cd /mnt/pool/main/p/patch/\n~$ sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter\n\nThen unmount:\n\n~$ sudo umount /mnt\n\nStep 2.\nOn a computer with Internet access, download the required firmware files from http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/wl_apsta-3.130.20.0.o and http://mirror2.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2\nStep 3.\nCopy the downloaded files to your home folder and execute the following commands consecutively in a terminal to extract and install the firmware:\n\n~$ tar xfvj broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2\n~$ sudo b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware wl_apsta-3.130.20.0.o\n~$ sudo b43-fwcutter --unsupported -w /lib/firmware broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5/driver/wl_apsta_mimo.o\n\nStep 4.\nUnder the desktop menu System > Administration > Hardware/Additional Drivers, the b43 drivers can be activated for use.\nNote: A computer restart may be required before using the wifi card.\nLiveCD/LiveUSB\nNote: The install media contents are mounted under /cdrom of the filesystem.\nStep 5.\nFor temporary use with the LiveCD and LiveUSB environments, instead of a computer restart, in a terminal issue the following commands:\n\n~$ sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb\n~$ sudo modprobe b43\n\nNote: Allow several seconds for the network manager to scan for available networks before attempting a connection.\n", "Q: Language changed to Chinese, how do I change it back?

When programming in C, I like to use man sections 2 and 3 to look up the form of system and library calls.\nBut I also often need to look up the form of a struct that is defined in a standard library. For example, sockaddr/sockaddr_un in 'sys/socket.h'. Is there any way I can look up structs or header files through man pages?\n\nA: To find these, it's helpful to use, for example, apropos socket to see which man pages may correspond to the information you desire. In this case, it's man 7 unix:\n#define UNIX_PATH_MAX    108\nstruct sockaddr_un {\n    sa_family_t sun_family;               /* AF_UNIX */\n    char        sun_path[UNIX_PATH_MAX];  /* pathname */\n};\n\nIs this what you were looking for?\n", "Q: How do I get rid of Windows during Wubi migration? So I read How do I migrate to a real partition, and/or get rid of Windows entirely?, but nowhere does it tell me how I go about replacing windows entirely. Is there a simpler/faster way than making two partitions, installing Ubuntu on one, and then formatting the other one with Windows on it?\n\nA: The problem is that your Wubi install is on your Windows partition. So, you can't format it and then migrate the Ubuntu install that was sitting on it before you formatted.\nFor most people, Wubi is a safe and easy way to try out Ubuntu and then a migration to a dual boot is the next step. For the rare cases such as your own, you can actually copy the virtual disks Wubi uses to an external drive, and then repartition your internal drive and migrate to it using the --root-disk= option. See HOWTO: migrate wubi install to partition for more info.\nBut basically your steps are as follows (assume /dev/sdb1 is the external drive partition):\n\n\n*\n\n*From Windows copy your \\ubuntu\\disks directory to the external drive (as well as any other data you care about)\n\n*Boot an Ubuntu CD/USB that is the same architecture as your Wubi install (i.e. 32-bit or 64-bit)\n\n*Re-format your internal drive creating an ext4 partition for Ubuntu and a swap partition (I'll assume /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2\n\n*Mount the external partition sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\n*Migrate:\nsudo bash wubi-move-2.1.sh --root-disk=/mnt/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2\nThere's a newer version of the script (available here) that can migrate to separate /boot, /usr and /home partitions, but the 2.1 version can only migrate to a single root partition.\nAnother way to do this:\nSince the Wubi migration script can also migrate a normal Ubuntu install, it's possible to migrate your Wubi install to an external drive. Then prepare the internal drive and migrate Ubuntu back to it. This means you don't need the live CD and also has the benefit that you can confirm the migrated install is fully functional before removing the source.\n", "Q: What's a terminal similar to iTerm2? My terminal choice has always been Guake, but at my job they have some Macs and I've started to use iTerm2 and I really love the split-functionality.\nSo I was searching for something similar in Ubuntu. I've tried with Guake + screen, but that is definitely not the same experience, because screen has to be executed as a command.\nYes, I could put it into my bash config, but if I split the screen I cannot move the scroll bar with the mouse (maybe there's a shortcut for this?). The other thing is that my bash config is completely screwed up with screen, I have a function to make an ls after each cd and another to show some info in my prompt when I enter a git repository.\nBoth don't work for me.\nI really would like to know about a program with the iTerm2 functionalities for Ubuntu or, in the worst case, try to emulate them the most similar possible.\n\nA: Even on the mac, I am using tmux! :)\n\n(source: github.io) \nTo install:\napt-get install tmux\n\n\nA: My choice of terminal is Yakuake. It has both vertical and horizontal functionality and more:\n\nInstallation\nsudo apt-get install yakuake\n\n\nA: I also use/d iTerm2. After trying out tmux and Yakuake, I opted for Terminator and am very happy with it. Reason being, I didn't want a purely CLI-based multiplexer (tmux) ... I wanted more GUI based controls. And I didn't want a KDE based GUI (Yakuake). Terminator was the closest I found to iTerm2. The only feature I didn't find was the \"clear\" feature.\nAfter deciding to switch and coming to post this answer, I noticed @jrg said this also, as a comment. I posted this because I almost missed Terminator and don't want others to miss it.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html\n\n*https://launchpad.net/terminator\nI became totally dependent on split-screens, and now my addiction can rage on:\nSimple layout example.\n\nComplex layout example.\n\n\nTo install on Ubuntu or Mint, search for Terminator in Software Center ( Software Manager on Mint )... or open Terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install terminator\n\n\nSo far, the only feature I have not found is the ability to right-click on a session screen, and have a \"clear\" option to purge the buffer of visible text in that session.\n", "Q: How often is php updated? I am using ubuntu 10.04.  I had installed php with the following command if that makes a difference: \nsudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5\n\nThe PHP version on my computer is 5.3.2-1. Will PHP be upgraded any further on this version?  If so, where can I find out when the next upgrade will be released and what version it will be? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Programs aren't generally updated in Ubuntu unless they absolutely have to. The current version of the program at release time is what goes in the repositories. After that, only critical security updates are allowed. So, you'll either have to upgrade Ubuntu or manually download the current version of PHP.\n\nA: After Ubuntu is released, it is considered stable. That means having as few changes as possible. Only necessary changes are added. Such updates are called Stable Release Updates (often called SRUs). You can read more about that process here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\n", "Q: tar -cvfz command results in error message unless I omit the hyphen before 'cvfz' \nPossible Duplicate:\nsudo tar cvpzf exiting with failure due to previous error \n\nWhen I run the command\ntar -cvfz backup.tar.gz somedirectory\n\nI get the following sterr\ntar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors\n\nHowever when I omit the preceding hyphen from -cvfz everything seems to work just fine.  Is there a known reason for why the hyphen is preventing me from tar'ing my files? \n\nA: I'm not sure why tar cvfz works, when accourding to a quick scan of the man page and my experience, a hyphen is standard practice. Maybe it's a BSD compatibility thing (like ps).\nAt any rate, your syntax is incorrect. -f takes the next argument as the filename to compress to. In this case, that filename is z, which isn't what you expected. Here's a sample of the output so you can see what I mean:\n$ tar -cvfz test.tar.gz scott\ntar: test.tar.gz: Cannot stat: No such file or directory\nscott/\nscott/netx/\nscott/netx/locks/\nscott/netx/locks/netx_running\ntar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors\n\nAn ls shows a file called z. The file command reveals that it's an uncompressed tar archive. It's uncompressed because the -z argument wasn't passed. And the error message came from trying to add the non-existant file test.tar.gz to the archive.\nSimply reorder the options and you'll be OK:\ntar -czvf test.tar.gz some/directory\n\nIf you always make the -f the last argument, you'll be fine. By the way, remember that short options (one-letter options) that take arguments don't normally require a space between the option and the argument.\nEDIT: By the way, if the form without the hyphen is a BSD-compatibility thing or something like that, then it's likely that the way that tar is invoked in such an environment is different, and doesn't require the f flag to specify the input file, but works more like cp or something. But this is just speculation based on comparison with ps (q.v.).\n", "Q: Access media between two Ubuntu-based systems sharing in Samba I have a laptop and desktop running Ubuntu and Xubuntu respectively -- both are 64 bit 11.10 version.\nI use XBMC on both machines to play media.\nI want to access the media on my desktop and play it on my laptop.\nI need somthing that can enable Library Update [tried UPnP and I have to find the directory everytime].\nI tried many things, but on either machine the other machine won't show up on the Windows network or auto detect.\nManually adding the IP address opens a password dialog and I can't even access with the id and pass of that machine.\n\nA: You could use SSH for file sharing like described here: https://askubuntu.com/a/34771/37157 It's a lot easier than Samba.\n\nA: Steps need to do\n1. check both computer can ping each other. ping from A computer with B computer's ip\nping BcomputerIP  [from A machine and vice versa]\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to share your file using samba in right way.

Using gitk or git gui, there's also graphical user interface available (more on GUIs for git). Furthermore, most IDE's (integrated development environments) support accessing git repositories.\nUsing git (or an other source code management system like svn), you don't need to create multiple version of your code; everything is managed by the scm. You can easily change between different versions of your files.\n\nA: Better use any versioning system, you dont have to manually name your files like filename_v1, filename_v2 etc.\nThere are already solutions available to maintain versioning of your code repositories.

This method is more like a workaround for the problem rather than a permanent fix to the issue. \nFirst of all, blacklist the wl, brcm80211 and b43 modules and all its dependencies.\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAfter opening the file, add the following to it:\nblacklist mac80211\nblacklist brcm80211\nblacklist cfg80211\nblacklist wl\nblacklist lib80211_crypt_tkip\nblacklist lib80211\nblacklist b43\n\nAnd then, edit the rc.local file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nAnd add the following above exit 0:\nmodprobe brcm80211\n\nThis will ensure that the brcm80211 driver module is loaded at the end of the boot process. You might need to call update-initramfs -u to ensure that your changes will be effective after a reboot.\n\nI should probably add the fact that I have BCM4313 wireless driver in my system and I have used these procedures to get it working properly.\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Broadcom_wireless\n\n*http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43\n\n*http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/brcm80211\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1783272\n\nA: I have a HP Pavilion dm4 with a BCM4313. I also had a lot of problems to get it to work in a normal, reliable way. Here is how I finally did solve my problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*After installing 11.10 64-bit wireless was working but in a very\nslow,unreliable way based on the brcmsmac driver in kernel\n3.0.0.12-generic. Please take note about the following: The brcmsmac driver was not present in the 11.04 release and the STA driver was working fine in release 11.04. Logically I started to suspect the brcmsmac driver.Before resolving my wifi problems I first installed all updates including the 3.0.0.14-generic kernel. I don't know if this is really necessary in order to make the steps below work.\n\n*Blacklist the bcma and brcmsmac as follows\nOpen the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run this command:\ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist\n\nAdd the following lines to this file:\nblacklist bcma\nblacklist brcmsmac\n\nSave the file and close the text editor.\n\n*Install the STA driver via the \"Additional drivers\" app. Please remind that you might need to do this via a wired connection since I do believe that blacklisting breaks your brmsmac based wifi connection. Maybe you also need to restart your laptop/netbook after installing the STA driver. I don't remember...\n\n*Try to connect to your wifi network.\nI hope this will work for you. Nowadays my wifi connection is fast and reliable.\n\nA: Other people had some trouble with your wifi card; here is another question that it's supposed to be solved:\nWiFi is not enabled  in Network Manager with a BCM4313\nHere is another question that explains the possible drivers for your hardware and how they work:\nHow do I get my Broadcom BCM4313 working correctly?\n\nA: Please check:\nlspci -nn\n\nIs it's pci.id 14e4:4727?\nIf so, this may be helpful:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source \nsudo modprobe wl\n\n\nA: I followed what jokerdino suggested, except I added brcmsmac to rc.local and did not blacklist it.  Then, go into the bios, disable the wireless card (put it on lock), go into the operating system,  restart, go into the bios and unlock it.  Then all the SSIDs started showing up and I was a happy camper.  I did verify that once I added brcmsmac that the network manager started showing wireless settings, but using rfkill I saw the hard lock was on the card, so I reset it.\n\nA: Try the solution here.\nhttp://www.computerandyou.net/2011/05/how-to-solve-no-wireless-networks-in-ubuntu-11-04/\n", "Q: How to do the windows equivalent of \"format C:\"? Bought a second hand laptop with no OS. Installed Ubuntu and have been running it now for about a year without any problems. Now need to use more windows applications (childrens educational applications that just won't run in Ubuntu).\nI already have a spare copy and licence codes for XP and would like to do either of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely wipe/erase Ubuntu from the laptop, then install XP ,\nand then run Ubuntu with dual boot. (the only thing we do with this\nlaptop is browse the internet. we have no data saved to the hard\ndrive so we don't even need a backup)\n\n*Create a new partition and install XP with Ubuntu (this seems\nlike a very troublesome option).\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot from a LiveCD\n\n*Use gparted to re-partition the drive; delete Ubuntu partition and create a FAT/NTFS partition leaving some space un-partitioned\n\n*boot from Windows install CD; install windows onto that partition\n\n*boot from Ubuntu LiveCD; install Ubuntu.\n\n\nThe point is - Ubuntu is aware of Windows and takes care not to break things (i.e. it'll add Windows entry to the boot menu etc.), while Windows installer does not behave nice to other OSes. So it makes sense to install Windows first.\nAlternatively, if you only need Windows to run just a few applications, you can run Windows inside a VirtualBox. This is much better as it doesn't require rebooting your machine each time. \n\nA: if you are going to give the laptop away, sell it, etc., don't forget to at least run a shred (see man shred, or google it) after you have removed all the partitions, because data is still easily recoverable, that is in case you didn't run a full disk encryption scheme.\n\nA: I would recommend doing 1) as it would be less hassle and as you don't mind removing your Ubuntu installation.\nFor formatting partitions I would use.\nmkfs /dev/???? \n???? is the name of the device. For example o nmy computer / is /dev/sda7\nA better way to format partitions would be to use Gparted after booting from a Ubuntu live DVD or live USB.\n\nA: To answer the question, you can format a hard drive or partition with gparted (graphical) or mkfs (command line).\ngparted is on the live / desktop CD and is fairly straight forward.\nTo use the command line you simply list your partitions\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThen format them with mkfs.partition type, for example \nmkfs.ntfs /dev/sda1\n\nSee man mkfs for details.\nNow be aware that formatting alone does not over write your data. To do that you can use dd or scrub\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M\n\nOr see scrub (or similar utilities) http://linux.die.net/man/1/scrub\nDBAN is also popular http://www.dban.org/\nYou then make partitions and format the hard drive, with gparted or the windows install CD.\nIf you wish to dual boot, it is easier to install windows first, and Ubuntu second.\nIf you are interested in perhaps a lighter weight version of Ubuntu, try Lubuntu.\n\nA: I recomend you to just simply boot with Windows CD, and when asked, delete all partitions and create a new one as windows require.\nYou'll lose all the information you have on Ubuntu, but I guess you already did a backup.\nEverything should be possible from Windows installation program no extra step is required.\n\nA: I dont think this is the right place to ask for how to format your partition using windows, better check any windows forums for detailed answers. I can only suggest that run your windows xp disc, it will automatically detect any empty disk space in your hard disk and show available partitions, delete the partiton containing linux. and create a new NTFS/FAT32 parition where you can install windows.\n", "Q: How do I open Youtube content in an app instead of my browser, while clicking on a link? Now when I follow a link in my browser to Youtube, it opens in a new page of my browser, in my case Firefox.\nI would have liked that it provokes the launch of another app, for example Minitube, VLC or Totem. This app should then run the desired video. This feature exists already on Android, where Youtube videos can be opened in the Youtube app or in your browser, and this association can be set as you want.\nI suppose I could extend this question to other video platforms like Dailymotion, or to other contents, like streaming media, but I will leave it for another question.\n\nA: Another possibility is: ext-youtube Firefox addon:\n\nPlay Youtube videos in external application.\n  You can use Minitube, SMPlayer or any other application that can play\n  Youtube videos given the link.\n\n\nA: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-flash\nthis will do exactly the job in firefox but it may be annoying if you're just browsing through youtube videos.\n*In my case the extension redirects the youtube links right to my Minitube so you may need to install it, too. \nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/01/minor-new-features-adds-to-linux-youtube-app-minitube/\n\nA: I suppose there's no tool to download and open youtube content given its url, but there are firefox add-ons like Video Download Helper to download and convert those contents. So it requires an additional step, but leads to the same result.\n\nA: I give you a suggestion to partially solve the problem or at least a hint; you could use Youtube unity lens that opens the result that you choose in vlc, minitube or your browser. So you can copy and paste your youtube url there or just search there for youtube videos.\nHere are some info about it.\n", "Q: How do I turn \"sudo apt-get\" text into clickable download links in Firefox? In support forums, tech blogs or any other website, one may encounter some instruction similar to the following:\n\nType sudo apt-get install sl in a terminal window, enter your password en you should get your program.\n\nI know the risk implied by installing additional software and I promise I will be careful. So how do I make Firefox understand that whenever it displays such a text, it should turn it into a link wich, when cliked on, will open the Software Center on the right page?\n\nA: The solution comprises two steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect firefox and apt-get\n\n*modify apt-get install textual content of web pages into hyperlinks pointing to apt://...\nRegarding the first step, there's apturl to handle hyperlinks that implement the apt:// \"protocol\".\nRegarding the second step, you could use the greasemonkey add-on together with a greasemonkey script that modifies the page content as desired. I didn't test it myself, but there are different examples to do this only, for example the \"Apt-Linker for Greasemonkey\" script.\n", "Q: How to secure Ubuntu server Is there any complete Ubuntu server hardening document which will suffice ISO 27001 or PCI DSS or any other security standard. \n\nA: I don't know of any official ubuntu server hardening document, but hopefully the following will give you a good starting point:\nNIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) publishes guidelines on how to secure *nix systems. This is what the big boys use as a starting point (DOD, Army, Etc.).\nAlso check out this SANS institute paper.\nThis list is also a good rule of thumb.\nYou can use tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and other vulnerability scanners to give you an idea of what ports and services need to be shut down, as well.\nThe National Vulernability Database is a good site to cross reference your software configuration against, as well.\nIf you are trying for compliance with ISO 27001, Then ISO should have documentation and checklist for this sort of thing (although it's a B*tch to look through).\nSorry if this is too general, I hope it helps.\n\nA: The above answer is a great one, but my only personal preference is the CIS Debian Hardening Guide that can be found at: http://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/en-us/?route=downloads.show.single.debian.100\n\nA: There are a number of hardening guides out there that are utilized, the industry standard that many frameworks look, specifically PCI-DSS is the CIS Benchmarks put out by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The CIS guidelines not only provide guidance for the operating systems such as Windows, Linux, AIX they also have hardening guidelines for many of the services they run such as Apache, MySQL, Oracle, Weblogic,SQL Server, IIS etc.  Commercialized tools also utilize their plugins when doing vulnerability and security checks with scanning products.  There are also security specific items to load for varying tasks such as IDS/IPS at the network, or HIDS at the host.  Tools installed to detect configuration and unauthorized change, parse and review logs for un-normal activity etc.  I have been building and hardening servers for the past 20+ years so if you have any more detailed questions I would be happy to try and answer them.\n", "Q: Where should I report a bug and apply the fix? I've identified a bug in XSane and have a four-line fix for it. I'm a little confused as to where I should go to have this fix incorporated... Should I submit a bug report to Ubuntu, Debian, XSane, or all three?\n\nA: XSane is in universe and from looking at it it looks like we import this package from Debian. However it seems the author does not read that list.\nIn this case I would file the bug and post to the XSane mailing list (I can't seem to find a bug tracker for XSane) and then file a bug in the Debian BTS pointing to the fix. \nIf the XSane guys take your fix then you're basically done, but having the bug report in the BTS would be a way for the maintainer to see that there's a new fix going upstream that he might be interested in. \nThen at some point we get the version in Debian. You can also file a bug in Launchpad but it's probably not needed.\nIn your case you mention that the project hasn't made a release in a year, in that case filing a bug in Debian is the appropriate thing to do and attach your patch. \n", "Q: How do I change Gwibber themes or column settings? After setting up my accounts with Gwibber, there is only one column showing all messages from each account. There are no controls or options to add columns, or to change what is seen in the single visible column (except to switch to replies or private messages). It is also impossible to change themes — the \"Preferences\" dialog has only \"Options\" and \"Messages\".

I'm going to set up a couple of general use computers on one of my lab's work benches.\nThere's a whole bunch of PPA repositories and applications from the Ubuntu repositories that I'd like to install after an initial Ubuntu installation.\nIs it possible to write up a script that will install all those apps and PPAs in one go, requiring me only to double click the executable script and type in the admin password?\nI imagine it would be fairly straight forward.

The first is a file (e.g. mysources) in the script directory where we saved a list of our software sources according to specifications for a sources.list e.g.:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/<maintainer>/<name>/<ubuntu> <release> main\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/<other_maintainer>/<name>/<ubuntu> <release> main\n...\n\nReplace all variables by the desired values\nThe second argument is a file (e.g. packages) with a list of packages we wish to install in the format e.g.:\npackagename\notherpackage\n...\n\nSave the script with e.g the name uptodate, make it executable and run from a terminal:\ncd /directory/of/script\nsudo ./uptodate mysources packages\n\nWhat does the the script do?\nIt just copies our mysources list to /etc/sources.list.d/mysources.list, updates package information and installs all packages from the packages list we provided by using xargs.\nNote: we may also have to download a valid key from launchpad keyserver to be able to install from the ppa we added.\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 72D340A3\n\nReplace the signing key (here 72D340A3) by the appropriate one\nNote 2: It is a good idea to run the script in a terminal and not by a double-click because we do want to know about errors.\n", "Q: Triple Head Nvidia and Intel I have a dell inspiron with an Intel integrated video and an nvidia video card. actually i have a dual head 2 x 27 samsungs monitors and i got an old 24 inch sitting there by himself crying to be plugged.\ni would like to know if it's possible to do have a triple head with my computer and if so, how can i do it?\n\nA: yes its possible, look at this one:\nhttp://wn.com/6_Monitor_Linux_workstation_using_Ubuntu_and_Compiz\nthis guy use 6 monitors, so 3 its possible\nnow, here's a config i found : https://superuser.com/questions/132290/triple-monitor-setup-in-linux\n# nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings\n# nvidia-settings:  version 1.0  (buildd@crested)  Sun Feb  1 20:25:37 UTC 2009\n# edited by me (brendan) 2010-04-18\n\n\n#   NVIDIA magic (something about glx-new?)\nSection \"Module\"\n    Load           \"glx\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Extensions\"\n    Option         \"Composite\" \"Enable\"\nEndSection\n\n\n\n#   Keyboards and Mice\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\n\n\n\n#   Physical Monitors:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Acer\"\n    ModelName      \"Acer H233H\"\n    HorizSync       40.0 - 70.0\n    VertRefresh     60.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier      \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Acer\"\n    ModelName      \"Acer AL2216W\"\n    HorizSync       40.0 - 70.0\n    VertRefresh     60.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor2\"\n    VendorName     \"BenQ\"\n    ModelName      \"BenQ W500\"\n    HorizSync       44.955 - 45.0\n    VertRefresh     59.94 - 60.0\nEndSection\n\n\n\n\n#   Physical Video Cards/Ports:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce 9800 GTX+\"\n#    Screen          0\n    BusID          \"PCI:5:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\n#Section \"Device\"\n#    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n#    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n#    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n#    BoardName      \"GeForce 9800 GTX+\"\n#    BusID          \"PCI:5:0:0\"\n#    Screen         1\n#EndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier    \"Device2\"\n    Driver        \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName    \"nVidia Corporation\"\n    BoardName     \"GeForce 7900 GT/GTO\"\n    BusID         \"PCI:4:0:0\"\n    Option        \"TVStandard\" \"HD720p\"\nEndSection\n\n\n\n\n####    Default 3-monitor Layout 'default'\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Default Layout\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    Screen      1  \"Screen2\" LeftOf \"Screen0\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"ServerFlags\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\n\n#   Virtual Screens\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"1\"\n#    Option         \"NoTwinViewXineramaInfo\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DFP-0: 1920x1080 +1680+0, DFP-1: 1680x1050 +0+30\"\n#    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DFP-0: 1920x1080 +1680+0, DFP-1: 1680x1050 +0+15;

Additionally there can be option to delete home-rw and live-rw settings and other low level tasks which couldn't be run in normal (gui) session.\nStarted with grub entry option:\n\ninit=/my_script.py\n\n\n*normal gui - something like control center but customized/extended with my modules\n\n*web - allows administrator to change the same computer settings via web browser (from another computer) + some stats, summary, info about this computer. In the previous version I've used Pyramid framework... And it would be nice if it could be accessible from mobile devices.\n\n\nI thought about an pluginable system so it would be easy to add new functionality or change existing.

Especially one that has three first class GUIs. Given that you've started this task by posting on AskUbuntu, my concern is that you are naively assuming this is going to be a quick project.\nIf you must continue, you might try starting with some code from YaST, OpenSuse's \"Yet Another Setup Tool\". It doesn't have a web GUI, but it does have console and graphical frontends, so presumably there is some separation in the code you could make use of. The trade-off, obviously, is that YaST is built for Suse, not Ubuntu.\nBut seriously, you're not using Canonical Landscape because it's too expensive? How much is your time worth?

Then if you just install Ubuntu and tell it to install along side windows, it will automatically shrink the windows partition to make room to install Ubuntu.  It will give you a slider so you can configure how much space to allocate to each.\nOnce Ubuntu is installed, it will be able to recognize the windows partition and you can store files there and be able to access them from Windows as well.  If you plan on storing most of your files on the Windows partition, then 15-20 gb will be enough for Ubuntu.\n\nA: Partitioning is more a art then a science, and there is more then one way to set up your partitions.\nI would start by backing up your data. Although rare, if there are problems partitioning data loss can occur.\nSecond, resize your ntfs partition from within windows. How much space you need for an depends on how much data and how many applications you have installed.\nNext you need to understand linux partitioning terminology. Windows uses letters, C:\\ and E:. Linux user /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 ....\nBoot a desktop, live CD and start gparted. Make an extended partition. Within the extended partition make several logical partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A shared data partition. NTFS or FAT can be used by both os out of the box. Size depends on quantity of data.\n\n*A swap partition. I would advise a swap partition of 4.1 Gb, you can share it across versions of Linux.\n\n*As many / (root) partitions as you want for Linux. I would use 15-20 Gb minimum per OS, although you can go as low as 5-10 Gb.\nThere is a nice guide on gparted here : http://gparted.sourceforge.net/display-doc.php?name=help-manual\n", "Q: How to select from which source a software must be installed? Here is my problem: I'm using Lucid Lynx and would like to have the latest version of freeciv.\nThe latest version I can get without adding a PPA is 2.1.10-1, it is in one of the default sources (Don't know which, Universe or Multiverse probably). The current version is 2.3 or something.\nI followed instructions on how to get up to date versions by adding ppa:kgoetz/ppa to the list of the sources. No problem here.\nAfter reloading the sources, the version I can install is still the 2.1.10-1, the one from official sources. From the Synaptic Package Manager, I could \"Force the version\", but the item is disabled in the menu.\nMy question is: is there a way to override or select a particular source when installing a software?\nThis question is, of course, not limited to my particular case but to a global use of software sources.\n\nA: The kgoetz PPA doesnt have a version of FreeCiv for Lucid.\nProbably the best source of opensource Lucid games - and the latest version of FreeCiv is playdeb.net.\nThey have packaged v2.3.1 for Lucid - download links\n\nIts probably best to stick with the \"stable\" versions in the repository.  However, I've found that the playdeb.net games are actually packaged very well - and the developers behind the site are very responsive to any issues and if you contact them, usually turn around a packaging fix very quickly.\nYou are correct to use synaptic manager to force versions - I rarely use this option unless there is a package issue with the latest update.\nObviously, if there isnt a newer version available either through PPAs or the standard repositories - you will not be able to force versions and hence the menu option would be greyed out/disabled.\n\nA: ppa:kgoetz/ppa doesn't have a package for freeciv, and it doesn't have packages for Lucid at all (but only packages for tweepy and creepy, both only for Maverick), see https://launchpad.net/~kgoetz/+archive/ppa/+packages).

I would suggest removing them from Wine, and installing them with PlayOnLinux.

What is the difference between apt-get update and apt-get upgrade?\nWhich should I run first?\nDo any of them automatically run the other?\n\nA: You should first run update, then upgrade. Neither of them automatically runs the other.\n\n*\n\n*apt-get update updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.\n\n*apt-get upgrade actually installs newer versions of the packages you have. After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the software you have installed. This is why you first want to update.\n\nAdditionally, you can use apt-get update && apt-get upgrade to do both steps one after the other.\n", "Q: Can I remove the buttons (min, max, close) from the unity panel and put them back on the window?

The problem: servers appear to be broken inside my Ubuntu chroot. No matter what kind of server I try to run, they all seem unresponsive (VLC server won't respond to client, mkRemote doesn't move the cursor, Apache gives an error about binding to port 80 and won't start, etc.).\nIf I'm not mistaken, what should normally happen inside a chroot is that all ports are shared between the chroot and the host, so if another machine tries to hit the host at port 80, it will still see the chrooted Web server. However, here, that isn't what's happening.\nWhen I run netstat from the chroot, every single process lists a foreign address of 0.0.0.0:*, meaning that the only machine which can act as a client is the local host. This is clearly incorrect and abnormal behaviour, as any process on my primary machine meant to be publicly visible lists a foreign address of :::* (which I assume means that any client can see it from any port).\nEdit: Disregard that; apparently the foreign address only distinguishes between whether it's listening for IPv4 or IPv6 connections, so it doesn't seem relevant here.\nSo far, Googling has returned nothing of value, and I'm basically stumped. Any ideas? Could it just be some setting which one of the chroot patch devs enabled by default, or does it seem like a more complicated issue?\nThanks.\nMore context: http://rootzwiki.com/topic/14682-webos-servers-inside-chrooted-ubuntu/\n\nA: I'm running a boinc service inside a chrooted debian.

I also have VirtualBox 4.1 running Windows Vista on the system.  And I have a very interesting situation with Printing.\nIf I have VirtualBox running with USB device that is my printer enabled to VirtualBox I am unable to print from Ubuntu.  I have to shutdown VirtualBox (I haven't tested but disabling the USB access probably does the same, I'll have to check) and  then I can print from Ubuntu.\nIs this normal behavior? Is there a way to configure either VirtualBox or Ubuntu or both so that they can gracefully share the printer?\n\nA: If both the virtualbox guest and ubuntu are sharing the same USB connection then you will need to define either the guest or ubuntu to be the \"master\" printer server.\nFor example, you can have two printer connections in ubuntu - one for the local USB printer and the second set to print to the windows guest print server.  \n\nThus, when you want to print from ubuntu when the windows guest is running, select the printer connected to the windows guest.\n\nA: Virtualbox is sort of \"funny\" that way with usb devices.

I'm using Gnome 64-bit edition with the classic desktop and I don't have overlay scrollbars installed.  My question is, how can I make the scrollbars wider?  They're too thin for me to hit as quickly or accurately as I'd like.  Is there a setting I can change in the theme files or d/gconf somewhere?  Thanks for your help!\n\nA: This gets about half of them:\nAdd the following lines to ~/.gtkrc-2.0\nstyle \"scroll\"\n{\n    GtkScrollbar::slider-width        = 40\n}\n\nclass \"*\" style \"scroll\"\n\nIt works for firefox, kicad, and several others.\nAnd this seems to get the other half:\nFor the rest (the gtk3 stuff, I guess), I copied the theme I was using from /usr/share/themes into ~/.themes and gave it a new name, \"MyTheme\".  Then in ~/.themes/MyTheme/gtk-3.0, I found the css file containing \"-GtkScrollbar-slider-width:\" and changed the value there.  I used the gnome tweak tool to select my new theme.  Now my sliders are all 40 pixels wide!\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 15.10.

The Ubuntu designers really screwed this up. Usable scrollbars are kind of important. Making them super narrow to take up less space was not a good idea. They need to be large so they're easy to click on! Ubuntu, like Microsoft, is trying so hard to make things look good on Mobile that they just end up ruining things for non-mobile users. (Forgive me for the critique)\n\nA: First of all, you should look for which theme you are using. In my case, for Ubuntu 17.10 the theme was Ambiance, and the concrete file to edit was this one:\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.20/gtk-widgets.css\n\nLook for this part of the CSS file:\n.scrollbar.vertical slider,\nscrollbar.vertical slider {\n    min-height: 15px;\n    min-width: 5px;\n}\n\nAnd then change the min-width: 5px; for whatever value you think is great.

As the titles says, what is Ubuntu TV and what are the main differences / advantages compared with any media center out there?\n\nA: Ubuntu TV is a flavor of the Ubuntu operating system intended for use on smart television sets. While with traditional televisions you flip between channels of programmed content, Ubuntu TV will provide an interface to choose shows and movies à la carte. It will also be internet enabled, letting you browse the web, use rich media applications, record shows, and control remotely from a mobile device.\nAbove all, Ubuntu TV is its tagline: TV for human beings. The televisions of 2011 are incredibly complex: they come with input cables, set-top boxes, and controllers with eighty buttons and as many modes (AV1, AV2, HDMI... do these look familiar?). Ubuntu TV aims to be a revolution in ease of use.\n\nFeatures\n\n\n*\n\n*Watch millions of movies and TV shows streamed over the web on demand.\n\n*Search and record programs from your cable provider.\n\n*Get music and media to all your other devices.\n\n*Access high quality online media from YouTube, Pandora and other sources online.\n\n*Share the screen with your smartphone, or use it as a remote!\n\n\nThe great differentiating feature of Ubuntu TV is its commitment to putting all these features in one easy-to-use interface. Other smart television products fragment the user experience with apps. Want to watch a video? You must check Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Youtube, and your cable listing to see which service has it. Ubuntu TV has one searchable, browsable interface that consolidates content from dozens of different sources, and makes it easily accessible to you.\nEthos\nUbuntu TV is an open platform based on the Unity interface, the Ubuntu One online storage service, and software written by such giants of the software industry as Intel and Nokia, as well as a community of thousands of passionate developers working for software freedom, a movement to free society from the dangers that closed platforms pose to privacy and technology working for users, not against them.\nAvailability\nUbuntu TV is not yet widely available, but is expected to ship on television sets by the end of 2012. You can watch an early version of Ubuntu TV in action here, and read more about its particular features and experience here.\nIf you are a developer or interested technical user, the source code of Ubuntu TV is already available. If you are an OEM or content provider, the company developing Ubuntu TV would love to discuss the future with you.\n\nA: Ubuntu TV is no longer supported.

A \"man in the middle\" might, for example, capture your user name and password.\nYou can fix it via several methods, I prefer\nssh-keygen -R server\n\nBefore you do that, however, you should check with the server sys admin to see if the (server) keys were changed.\nFor your scp error, you need to use the full path. My guess would be:\nscp myfile user@server:/home/user_name/Folder\n\n\nA: Open the below file and erase the text within the file\nvi /home/username/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nrestart again the scp command\n\nA: This will also happen if you have migrated a server onto another piece of hardware or changed IP Addresses.  Generally, I copy the known_hosts file to a .bak; vi the file and remove the offending key.  Then when I ssh in again, it prompts for the password and with permission adds it to the known hosts.  You don't even have to put in a password, just say yes to known_hosts.\nAs stated previously though - SOMETHING changed so you need to find out what.  These errors don't just magically appear so use caution!\n\nA: I fix by just open the file :- /home/username/.ssh/known_hosts \nand delete the line containing the server name and again ues the scp command. \nThis generally happens when we use the commands in the different servers. \n", "Q: Random/invalid songs appearing on iPod Touch music streaming app? When I first installed the app, it contained all music and sound effects from a game I've never played, and none of mine. Deleting the cache didn't fix it.\nI reinstalled it, and it seemed to work fine, except for some song titles (I could listen to it, but it said 'Unknown title'), artists and albums missing. Also, deleted songs stay for all eternity: I changed the tags and titles of some songs and deleted the old ones, but now they are duplicates (the old ones give me an error though). Deleting the cache had no effect.\nToday, I found another song called \"bit remix\", which was a chiptune cover of a popular anime's ending theme. It was nice, but I had never heard it before. Reloading the titles and deleting the cache did not fix it.\nWhy is it so buggy, and why do I see others' music collections?\n\nA: This sounds like a bug around caching (for the \"old songs don't go away from the cache\" bit), and a very serious issue (around seeing songs that aren't yours).\nFor the first I'd ask that you file a bug.\nThe second I suspect is Ubuntu One picking up music from games or other things you also sync with us. To confirm this and so both of us sleep better, please contact support. With some account details from you, we'll be able to quickly figure it out.\n", "Q: Trackpad mouse jumping all over while typing I am running Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit on a Dell Inspiron 17R.

On first login, run the commands ”sudo apt-get update” and ”sudo apt-get upgrade”, to make sure all available updates are installed. After installation, reboot. Then run the command ”sudo apt-get install gnome”. After completion (it will take some time), reboot and you have an Ubuntu with Debian Gnome GUI.

The PPA will be updated with precise packages as\nsoon as this is done.\nThose packages should be available within a week or 2, and definitely\nbefore precise's release.\nNote that no more releases of cinnamon will be available for other\nversions of Ubuntu, since the gnome3.4 libraries are not available on\nversions of Ubuntu prior to precise.\n\n\nPrecise builds are now available in the PPA and can be installed per the linked answer.\nFrom now on, the Oneiric packages in the PPA will be fixed at v1.4.  Thus if you are an Oneiric (11.10) user, your upgrade route should be via the 12.04 distro route, followed by reactivating or adding the PPA.\nAlternatively, you may wish to consider one of the other answers to the question.\n\nA: Cinnamon is a Gnome-Shell desktop fork.

I cannot vouch for the veracity of these PPAs\nOption 1: 12.04 & 14.04 users only:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tsvetko.tsvetkov/cinnamon\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nOption 2: 14.04 users only:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:lestcape/cinnamon\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nAs an alternative you may wish to consider the unstable nightly automatic builds - please note Gwendal's warning above:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-nightly\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nOption 3: In addition, you can also install cinnamon 2.2 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and derivatives by adding Linux Mint 17 Qiana  repository in your system.\nOpen file /etc/apt/sources.list with nano command:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAdd the following line at the end of file /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb http://packages.linuxmint.com/ qiana main upstream import\n\nUpdate the repository then install the authentication key\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linuxmint-keyring\n\nUpdate the repository again and install Cinnamon 2.2:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nAfter installation\nLogout and select the Cinnamon session:\n\nEnter you password and you'll see the Cinnamon desktop\n\n... showing the traditional start type menu and applet design from Gnome-2\n\n\nExtensions/Applets\nThe Cinnamon desktop uses the same philosophy as Gnome-Shell - functionality can be added to by installing Extensions & Applets.\nCinnamon uses its own Settings tool.\nCinnamon Settings\n\nCinnamon Applets\nSimilar to gnome-shell extensions - you can install applets from a dedicated Mint website.\n\n\nA: PPA for 12.04 (nightly build)\nPackages for Precise are now available on the nightly PPA : \nThe stable PPA will take a little more time before it gets updated, any feedback about the nightly packages will be very welcome.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-nightly\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\n\nA: Installing Cinnamon from an existing Environment\nFor what I've tested since I use the Cinnamon interface, the best way these days to install Cinnamon desktop is in my case on Ubuntu Mate.\nThere's no need need to add the ppa, because Cinnamon packages (see link for version depending on Ubuntu release) are included on the Ubuntu sources.\nContent description of every Cinnamon packages can be found here.\nAfter a clean Ubuntu installation:\n\n*\n\n*sudo su\n\n*apt update && apt upgrade\n\n*apt install cinnamon\n\nIf you like to install it minimaly (without any tools):\n\n*\n\n*apt install cinnamon --no-install-recommends\n\n*apt install -f (to check for depencies)\n\n\n\n\n*reboot\n\n*Select the wanted default user interface before login\n\n\nInstalling Cinnamon on Ubuntu server 22.04\nFrom scratch with no environement installed yet:\nIf you would like to have the Ubuntu kernel with Cinnamon as only desktop environement:\n\n*\n\n*You can download and install Ubuntu server\n\n*Select the minimized installation and no third party driver (because it will install a server version)\n\n\n\n*update & upgrade & reboot after connection to your session instance.\nsudo su\napt update && apt upgrade\nreboot\n\n\n*Install muffin (low gnome window manager, where Cinnamon is based on)\nsudo apt install muffin\n\n\n*Install slick-greeter (low gtk greeter made for muffin and looks like unity)\nsudo apt install slick-greeter\n\n\n*And finally install the desktop environement (minimaly to get only the environment without other software):\nsudo apt install cinnamon --no-install-recommends\n\n\n*Install yaru-theme-icon package present on the Ubuntu server (compatible icon pack as base)\nsudo apt install yaru-theme-icon\n\n\n*Install your graphic driver and Reboot\n\n\n*resolve networking applet issues\n\n\n*Install additional packages to personalize your desktop.\nI personally recommend gnome software since it's compatible with Ubuntu as much as with Cinnamon.\nEven for system settings, like the control panel. I did install it for system management and testing, so here some I've installed:\nsudo apt install gnome-logs eog inetutils-ping nmcli gnome-calculator gnome-screenshot xdg-user-dirs-gtk gedit-plugins gnome-font-viewer mate-themes simple-scan gparted gpart gnome-control-center gnome-disk-utility \n\nYou'll find more information about those on the Ubuntu packages page.\nFor the greeter settings you'll need to install the \"Login Window\" settings: sudo apt install lightdm-settings\n\nFor its background image use only the /usr/share/backgrounds folder. Because the user folder's aren't permitted.\nFor the internet browser, I prefer Chrome and install it with wget and dpkg -i.\nHere's a screenshot of this desktop:\n\nHere's the Cinnamon menu with usefull settings and tools configured into the \"System Tools\" menu for my needs.\n\nHere's the greeter:\n\nAnd here you can see no other environment choice as Cinnamon:\n\nLast installation system information:\nKernel: 5.19.0-23-generic arch: x86_64 bits: 64 compiler: N/A\nDesktop: Cinnamon v: 5.4.12\ntk: GTK v: 3.24.34 dm: LightDM Distro: Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu)\nInstalling Cinnamon from Mint PPA on Ubuntu 22.04 server\nIn this post you can find how to install the most recent version of Cinnamon on your server, based on the Linux Mint PPA.\nI've also a made a bash script menu to solve most of the issues I've got on Ubuntu server with Cinnamon installed. It's availble on Github here.\n\nRelated post\n", "Q: Add more functions in Gedit I'm trying out Ubuntu for the first time so I'm a very new but I've done a bit of searching and I want to get something pretty similar to Notepad++\nGedit so far seems to be the pretty similar except I like a feature in N++ where I can add more function names to a list so it knows to colour them a certain way. For example in my prepared statements (PHP) I use things such as prepare or execute but Gedit doesn't recognize these and just leaves them white.\nI'm sure there must be a file somewhere which contains a list of all known function names and I'd imagine you can edit it to add more, but I have no idea on where to start looking? I can't find a plugin for it either so I guess this is the only way.\nEither that or I install Wine and use that to run N++ but a tutorial I found for that tells me to start typing in all sorts of things to install it and I have no idea where I being typing them ha.

When that is done, the launcher panel shows the correct icon identified in the desktop file in all use cases: autolaunch, launch from terminal, find and launch in dash.\n", "Q: Failed to open home directory Thunar is returning an error when I try to open my home directory:\n\nFailed to open directory \"matt\".

I am using eclipse on Ubuntu 11.10\nWhen I try to open an project in eclipse IDE, it complains that the .project file can not be found. Now if I open the project folder in Ubuntu file browser and press Ctrl-H the hidden .project file is shown. After this, moving back to eclipse I can easily open the project.\nI need to do this every time I login to ubuntu.\n\nA: This may happen because of a bug in JDK. There is a similar question for Windows on StackOverflow but same may be true for Linux/Ubuntu as well. Try updating your JDK to the latest version and then test opening a project with hidden .project file. \n\nA: Maybe not ideal, but a quick fix would be to always show hidden files/folders. In Nautilus, in the menu go Edit>Preferences, then under the Views tab, under Default View enable Show Hidden and Backup Files. My reason for suggesting this is that you seem more interested in quickly accessing your .project file in Eclipse than care about whether hidden files show up in the file manager. Hopefully in the future Eclipse will be able to \"see\" hidden files automatically.\n", "Q: HP Photosmart 5510 multifunction printer scanner not found I can not get my Ubuntu 11.10 system to recognize the scanner in my HP Photosmart 5510 multi-funtion printer.

Activate wireless printing on the printers touch screen and follow the instructions . Run HP-SETUP. Select \"Wireless/802.11\". Follow the instructions and your set to go.\nFor some reason if you use the USB connection and select \"Universal Serial Bus (USB)\" during the HP-STUP you get a Communication Error.

I have often observed that in other distributions (not Ubuntu derivatives) even after enabling font hinting and rgb aliasing, the fonts dont look as good as Ubuntu. \nWhat are the specific optimizations carried out in ubuntu for font display?\n\nA: There is a bit of subjectivity (to say the least) on fonts and font rendering.\nSee : http://blog.mageprojects.com/2011/05/27/linux-fonts-compared-ubuntu-11-04-linuxmint-11-fedora-15-windows-7-sabayon-5-5/\nThat first link has a screen shot of several fonts on several OS and the author concludes :\n\nThe Ubuntu and LinuxMint fonts look ugly and way to fat. period! \n\n(Authors words, not mine).\nThere are a few resources you can look into, you will have to decide for yourself what you like best.\nA few resources you might look at (you mentioned you were using Fedora)\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts#Font_settings\nhttp://blog.andreas-haerter.com/2011/07/18/tune-improve-fedora-fonts-typeface-ubuntu-like-sharp-fonts\nhttp://fedorasolved.org/Members/khaytsus/improve-fonts\nRather the telling you how to configure you fonts, I hope those links help you understand how to configure them to your personal preference.\n\nA: I don't think that Ubuntu have any specific changes to font rendering that are not available upstream. Ubuntu does use it own font (called Ubuntu) which you may like more than fonts used by other distros. You can check if setting other distro font to Ubuntu font makes them look the same.\n\nA: One reason may be that there are software patents covering certain font rendering techniques. US-based distributions (such as Red Hat) have more difficulty distributing these techniques than EU-based distributions (such as Ubuntu).\n", "Q: Resolution problem on Intel 950 GPU with Ubuntu 11.10 I just got a nice looking ultra mini desktop for US$ 150, which uses a Digisol Motherboard with a Atom Dual Core 1.8 Ghz Processor - D425, with 2 GB RAM.

When I run windmill firefox http://www.example.com the Windmill IDE comes up fine. When I run windmill firefox https://www.example.com the IDE fails. (I have installed pyopenssl in my Python virtual environment. https failed completely before I did this.)\nI suspect that this is because I haven't installed the Certificate Authority (.crt file) for Windmill itself.\nThe Windmill team provide instructions for installing the Windmill CA on Windows and Mac, but not Linux, let alone Ubuntu :(\nThe instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/certificates-and-security.html and How do I install a root certificate? suggest that I need both a .crt file and a .key file, but only a .crt file is provided, and seems to be all that is needed on other OSes.\nHow can I install the provided .crt file? (Or, what is the Ubuntu equivalent of the provided Windows/Mac instructions?)\n\nA: The .crt file is already installed in the Firefox profile created by Windmill. No additional steps are required.\nYou can verify this by running Firefox through Windmill, then opening Edit (menu) | Preferences (menu option) | Advanced (tab) | Encryption (tab) | View Certificates (button) | Authorities (tab), and scrolling down the list to confirm Windmill is listed.\nIf for some reason it isn't (due to a bug) you could try adding it manually. In general Linux/Ubuntu applications don't use a central resource for certificate authorities, so you can follow the directions above and click the Import... button. The Windmill CA instructions include links to the latest .crt file.\nThis hasn't actually solved my problem, but eliminates this as the cause and answers the question.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu One syncing so slow? I'd like to use Ubuntu One to sync some important files that I use frequently across several machines. I have ubuntu one set up correctly (or so it appears), yet when I add the folder, it took about 15 minutes to upload a single 5kb readme file. There is a notification that says it is transferring X and #### other files, and I guess it is, but it is doing so painfully slowly. My connection is not slow; there seems to be no reason for the speed to be so poor. I've checked the settings and I don't have the bandwidth limiter on either.\nDoes anyone else have this problem? I can't image anyone using this service or paying for it for that matter if it were so slow. What can I do about it?\nAlso, I'm on 11.10 64bit\n\nA: We've been having issues with our file synchronizing servers. They're on their way to being resolved; you should find the service better already, with more improvements to come (today it'll still be slow during peak hours).\n", "Q: ATI Driver issue, fglrxinfo returning null display error, Xorg.conf file looks funky I have a HP dv6, specifically with a ati radeon hd 5650. It's one of those wonderful hybrid graphics cards.\nI've spent a great amount of time trying to install the drivers for this graphics card properly. My primary reason to do this is to run gnome 3, which will not work properly when I install the fglrx driver from the additional drivers section of system settings. I know the desire to run gnome 3 might sound trivial, but I've made it my mission to get this to work. Is there a way to simply ignore the ati graphics and go with the intel graphics when using gnome?\nSo, after reinstalling ubuntu using wubi, I immediately followed this guide.\nHowever, I ran into some blocks. When I ran the aticonfig command, I got a response\nPowerXpress error: Cannot stat '/usr/lib64/fglrx': No such file or directory\n\nI setup a symbolic link between /usr/lib and /usr/lib64. I do not know if that is correct, but it got my forward. When I rebooted the computer after calling aticonfig, I ended up hanging while booting on a black screen. It was like\nChecking Blah            [ok]\n.....\nChecking Battery State   [ok]\n\nThere were some fails, but the ones I could see were not important.\nSo i go into tty1 and trying running the command fglrxinfo, but i receive the response:\nError: unable to open display (null)\n\nSo, I look at my Xorg.conf file, and the contents, which seem strange, are as follows:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier   \"aticonfig Layout\"\n    Screen     0 \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\" 0 0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Module\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier   \"aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0\"\n    Option       \"VendorName\" \"Ati Proprietary Driver\"\n    Option       \"ModelName\" \"Generic Autodetecting Monitor\"\n    Option       \"DPMS\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\n\nSection \"device\"\n    Identifier   \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n    Driver       \"fglrx\"\n    BusID        \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier   \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\"\n    Device       \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n    Monitor      \"aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Subsection \"Display\"\n        Viewport  0 0\n        Depth  24\n    EndSubsection\nSection\n\nI tried doing aticonfig --acpi-services=off as well as other threads state, but that did not work. \nI'd really appreciate any help that I can get.\nThanks.\nEDIT\nI found out that if I remove my xorg.conf file, I can at least boot and login into ubuntu's gui\n\nA: This is how I got it to work on my Intel/AMD hybrid setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update X.org to latest version by adding the following PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\n*Symbollically Link lib & lib64 to avoid lib64 error:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/ /usr/lib64/\n\n\n*Install ATI Driver Manually DO NOT build deb packages:\nsudo sh ./amd-driver-installer-12-1-x86.x86_64.run\n\n\n*Update X.org:\nsudo aticonfig --initial --nobackup\n\n\n*After that, reboot your computer.\n\nA: I was stuck with the same problem, in Ubuntu Precise x64 (Linux Mint Maya actually).

Since the internet connection was not working (it's KDE, uses wallet to store passwords, though you could theoretically introduce blindly its password as with the user login), instead of installing the last xorg (as per Octavian) y just made the symbolic link:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib32/ /usr/lib/\n\nAnd reboot. And it worked.\n\nA: For ubuntu 14.4.2 - I have just copied cp -r /usr/lib64/fglrx /usr/lib/.\nBecause aticonfig will checked permissions for fglrx folder, and ln -sis always rwxrwxrwx\nI know that is not good variant, but all works)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 9.04 upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10 failed, initramfs?

According to this page (scroll down to the bottom), you can create custom keyboard shortcuts in the keyboard preferences dialog.\nSo, you can create your own shortcut here. Choose an appropriate shortcut, such as Ctrl+Alt+R and map it to xfwm4 --replace.\nThis is basically what Gnome Shell's R command does, and it's completely different from using Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to kill the X server.

It's almost the same, and a snappier on lesser hardware.\n\nA: The short answer is No. The existence of environments such as Xfce and LXDE is not by accident. They appeared out of needs - main of them being less resource usage i.e. better performance at less resources available. \nIssue No. 2 - inherent Unity flaw:\nIt uses long animations - Unity at its best will feel 'smooth' but never 'super fast'\nUnlike many people say animations for main Unity elements like Dash cannot be disabled: How to disable all Unity animations?\nIssue No. 3 - bugs in Unity:\nI can't judge whether it has more bugs than other environments or shells but there are some issues in Unity that degrade overall experience e.g. Dash maximized opens up twice as long as Dash at standard size, see https://askubuntu.com/a/169634/29347 Since Unity relays on Compiz as another layer, I'd say it's even more prone to bugs.\nMy personal recommendation for those with modest rigs or even those with modern hardware but not wanting to 'wait for animations to finish': Lubuntu (with LXDE)\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_desktop_vitals&num=1\nOn a side note:\nUnity as well as GNOME cause gaming performance degradation.

Obviously the in5 and in6 are wrong, probably because they are not connected on your motherboard.  The alarm value for in1 is probably also just set wrong.  There is really no telling what the correct value is supposed to be without reverse engineering your motherboard.\n", "Q: How can I install the Social-Engineering Toolkit (SET)?

There are plans to suggest 64-bit Ubuntu as the default (the way 32-bit is suggested now) as most people's hardware is capable of running it.\nStill, to see the total memory as seen by the kernel, as well as a report on how it's initially allocated, you can do this:\ndmesg |grep \"Memory: \"\n\nThis will show a line such as this one:\n[    0.000000] Memory: 3823988k/4849664k available (6109k kernel code, 874468k absent, 151208k reserved, 4876k data, 984k init)\n\nMy system has 4GB of RAM installed, however the total reported is something like 4.7 GB (I'm guessing the BIOS reports more memory due to address space for the video cards, PCI and IO devices and others). In the end only 3.6 GB are available to applications due to these concerns.\nNote the \"absent\" memory amount, this \"reflects the memory addressing space lost due to memory holes in the memory map.  Typically holes are left for PCI space, IO, etc.. \nEvery vendor model system is different, and every system will have a different\nvalue reported for the absent memory.\"\nAlso look at the question pointed to by fossfreedom, it gives you some more of an explanation of where addressing space may be being used.\n", "Q: vpnc cannot connect to VPN due to vpnc-script I am trying to connect establish VPN connection with vpnc but it failed with message \nError: either \"to\" is duplicate, or \"ipid\" is a garbage\n\nAccording to http://blog.nowherelan.com/2011/10/10/vpnc-on-ubuntu-oneiric-error-either-to-is-duplicate-or-ipid-is-a-garbage/ I replaced vpnc-script but got a new error message:\n/etc/vpnc/vpnc-script: 658: Syntax error: end of file unexpected (expecting \";;\")\n\nAfter that it starts vpnc-connect \"in background\" but no IP address is assigned: \nifonfig -a:\ntun0      Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  \n          POINTOPOINT NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:3 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:500 \n          RX bytes:531 (531.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nuname -a:\nLinux mobile 3.0.0-14-generic #23-Ubuntu SMP Mon Nov 21 20:28:43 UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nIdeas?\nFinally I got working version of vpnc-script here http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc-scripts.git/blob_plain/4deaaf9a32:/vpnc-script\n\nA: I saw that this bug was fixed and relased only for Ubuntu Precise and I think you should mark it as affecting you and ask there for a possible solution to the problem in Oneiric (a merge of the released fix in Oneiric or another solution).\n\nA: i have the work around for the following error :\nstep 1: see what you need to do is, firstly take the backup of the vpnc script through the below command :\nsudo cp /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script.bck\n\nStep 2: now what you need to do is open the vpnc-script by any editor love to work with(vi, vim , emacs, gedit).\nsudo gedit /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script\n\nand remove the content inside it and copy the content below :\n\n#!/bin/sh\n# List of parameters passed through environment\n#* reason                       -- why this script was called, one of: pre-init connect disconnect\n#* VPNGATEWAY                   -- vpn gateway address (always present)\n#* TUNDEV                       -- tunnel device (always present)\n#* INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS         -- address (always present)\n#* INTERNAL_IP4_MTU             -- mtu (often unset)\n#* INTERNAL_IP4_NETMASK         -- netmask (often unset)\n#* INTERNAL_IP4_NETMASKLEN      -- netmask length (often unset)\n#* INTERNAL_IP4_NETADDR         -- address of network (only present if netmask is set)\n#* INTERNAL_IP4_DNS             -- list of dns servers\n#* INTERNAL_IP4_NBNS            -- list of wins servers\n#* INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS         -- IPv6 address\n#* INTERNAL_IP6_NETMASK         -- IPv6 netmask\n#* INTERNAL_IP6_DNS             -- IPv6 list of dns servers\n#* CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN             -- default domain name\n#* CISCO_BANNER                 -- banner from server\n#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC              -- number of networks in split-network-list\n#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_ADDR      -- network address\n#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_MASK      -- subnet mask (for example: 255.255.255.0)\n#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_MASKLEN   -- subnet masklen (for example: 24)\n#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_PROTOCOL  -- protocol (often just 0)\n#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_SPORT     -- source port (often just 0)\n#* CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_DPORT     -- destination port (often just 0)\n#* CISCO_IPV6_SPLIT_INC         -- number of networks in IPv6 split-network-list\n#* CISCO_IPV6_SPLIT_INC_%d_ADDR -- IPv6 network address\n#* CISCO_IPV6_SPLIT_INC_$%d_MASKLEN -- IPv6 subnet masklen\n\n# FIXMEs:\n\n# Section A: route handling\n\n# 1) The 3 values CISCO_SPLIT_INC_%d_PROTOCOL/SPORT/DPORT are currently being ignored\n#   In order to use them, we'll probably need os specific solutions\n#   * Linux: iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING <conditions> -j ROUTE --oif $TUNDEV\n#       This would be an *alternative* to changing the routes (and thus 2) and 3)\n#       shouldn't be relevant at all)\n# 2) There are two different functions to set routes: generic routes and the\n#   default route.

I have a partition for Windows (sda2) and one for Ubuntu (sda3). I've installed Ubuntu from Windows with the Windows Ubuntu installer (Wubi) and set an installation size of 13GB (I guess).\n\nEverything works fine, but I'm running out of disk space, even though there should be enough left. Here's what GParted says:\n\nAnd this is what Ubuntu tells me (and actually believes):\n\nSo it seems that Ubuntu only uses the space defined as the installation size in Wubi. Why is that (since I assumed that \"installation size\" just affected the amount of packages and extra stuff installed) and how can I make Ubuntu use the entire partition?\n\nA: I personally support using wubi (as an alternate to virtualization) to determine if you like Ubuntu and if it works on your hardware. Personally my advice is that if you like ubuntu I would advise you do a \"standard\" installation, you are half way there, you have already partitioned your hard drive.\nAt any rate, your problem is with the default size of the wubi virtual disk. Wubi loop mounts a file and you have to increase the file size.\nSee the most excellent post by bcbc on the Ubuntu forms for a walk through. Only you can decide if it is easier to maintain / resize your wubi install or start fresh.\n\nA: It is a little difficult to understand your question, but I'll try to help you make some sense of the situation and hopefully that will help you to get an answer.\nThe \"installation size\" is how big the virtual disk Ubuntu uses will be. So essentially you gave it a 17GB \".disk\" file.\nIt appears you are confusing the wubi install with a real installation (which would have installed Ubuntu on the partition you have labeled as Linux). In order to install Linux on that partition, you actually need to boot Ubuntu from the livecd/usb and not use the \"wubi\" installer (which installs inside of windows).\nAs for why you are only seeing 939.9MB free, I'm not 100% sure from the details you have given.\n", "Q: ImageMenuItem Icons in Python AppIndicator I tried to create an AppIndicator using gtk.ImageMenuItems.

So I got a new one off of Amazon real cheap, it says it's High Res HD15 on the posting I got it from. However when I boot into Kubuntu or Ubuntu, the resolution is wayyyyyyy too low and the proper one is not appearing in the settings. Also, the GRUB menu is a different color (dark blue vs. light blue) and the resolution is smaller.\nThe proper resolution is displayed in Windows.\nIs there any way to fix this? do I have to buy a new cable?\n\nA: Few options/ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Good VGA cables are not expensive. For about £20 you can buy a 2m, triple-shielded Lindy cable.\n\n*Good monitors aren't much more, to be fair and will give you much more value than a diamond-encrusted VGA cable. There's a reason DVI and HDMI replaced VGA: they're better.\n\n*Get somebody else to test the cable in their set up.\n\nA: This may seem a bit easy, but have you tried changing resolution back to normal from the Monitors menu.

Is there a way to hide the 'shortcuts' section of the Dash Home and just display the 'search'  (+results once a search term is entered)?\n\nA: I would support your \"bug\" theory.\nHowever, according to Ayantana Design, the minimise/maximise buttons now work as expected:\nDesired solution:\n- When the Dash in windowed:\n--- 'Close' window decoration closes the Dash\n--- 'Minimise' window decoration is inactive (does nothing)\n--- 'Maximise' window decoration makes the Dash full screen\n\n- When the Dash in full screen:\n--- 'Close' window decoration closes the Dash\n--- 'Minimise' window decoration is inactive (does nothing)\n--- 'Restore' window decoration returns the Dash to windowed state\n\nAs to the \"increasing brightness\" issue - if you take the above as the expected result - your observation could be classified as a bug - albeit relatively cosmetic.\n\nA: The brightness change is indeed a bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/871327\n", "Q: How do I help Ubuntu becoming less crappy? I have used Ubuntu for several years now, and it was a very stable and nice system. However, it became really crappy since a few releases, and it's almost impossible for  me to work with Ubuntu 11.10. Of course, I could switch to another distribution etc., but I want to help my favourite distribution to get less crappy.\nI have commented / reported several bugs and tried to help when I can, but the most bugs are just ignored by the maintainers so I have no hope that these really annoying issues will be fixed.\nDo you know other ways how I can help Ubuntu to become useable again?\n(Of course I know that it works fine for many people, but that doesn't help me when I need TV-OUT on a separate X screen [which worked the releases before] and the many other things that don't work anymore.)\n\nA: It's a bit rude to say it like that, but I must admit you're right. The latest releases are really buggy, and most of my bug reports got thrown away until they expired. In the end I just switched to Arch Linux (which I don't recommend if you want something user-friendly, by the way).\nOn the positive side, Ubuntu an open-source project developed by a community. Which means that anyone with sufficiënt programming experience can participate.\nIf you're not a programmer, you can help to get the bugs out before it's released. You can do that by downloading the latest build here, installing it on a spare computer (or virtual machine), and report every bug you find (if it hasn't already been reported, if it has, just hit the This affects me link at the top of the page). I've noticed the developers take bug reports about upcoming releases a tad more serious.\n\nNote that Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04 and 11.10 weren't LTS (Long Time Support) releases. An LTS version of Ubuntu is released every 2 years (and since a few days this also counts for Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Edubuntu). The LTS releases are much more stable and better tested than all releases between them. Personally I always call the non-LTS releases Beta releases, as they sometimes are of Beta-quality.\nIn my opinion this should be better advertised on the Ubuntu website.\n", "Q: What happens after someone receives Ubuntu membership? What happens after someone receive Ubuntu membership?\nHow s/he receives the benefits listed here? I knew it's documented somewhere on the wiki but so far couldn't find any trace of it. \nThanks\n\nA: Here is essentially what happens.\nMost people appear at the regional membership boards on IRC.\nAfter you appear at the membership board, in the IRC session, they will ask you some questions related to your membership - logs of the IRC session I was at are here.\nAfter that, what happens is something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Someone adds you to the Ubuntu members group on Launchpad.\n\n*Sometime in the next 48 hours, a cronjob adds a @ubuntu.com email alias for you.\n\n*At that point, you can apply for the other benefits of membership such as a IRC cloak, add your blog to the Ubuntu Planet etc.\n\nA: Which benefit do you want / need ? Some occur once the approving board takes action, can take a week or so (ubuntu email), some you need to configure yourself.\nFor an irc cloak, for example, ask on #ubuntu\nFor acknowledgement on the forums, post in the RC or ask a forums admin.\nThe page you posted has links to various pages for other benefits (business cards, syndication on the planet, etc).\n", "Q: Can I boot off of a .vdi file? I am using windows 7 as a host & have ubuntu vdi file. Which I created using Virtual Box & installed the Ubuntu OS in ubuntu.vdi file. Now I want to boot Ubuntu Directly on my hardware. that is at booting time of my pc I could see an option to boot win 7 & Ubuntu. Just want to boot Ubuntu.vdi as real machine. Please help me out.\n\nA: You are IMO better off doing a fresh, standard installation. I do not know an easy way to directly boot your ubuntu.vdi, you could probably copy the partition with dd or gparted, but you would then need to manually install and configure grub.\nInstalling will do the configuration for you, and is thus going to be easier.\nYou can back up your user data (home) to a usb drive or transfer it from vitrualbox with the use of  shared folders.\nYou can generate a list of installed packages with\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > packages.list\n\nYou then transfer packages.list to your fresh install and use it to restore you packages with \nsudo dpkg --set-selections < packages.list\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\n\nA: You can, as long as the disk image is a fixed size image. You are a lot better of just doing a new install of Ubuntu, and then mounting the .vdi file by opening it in Virtualbox or with Archive Mounter and then copying your files over. But, if you really want to and are willing to spend enough time at it, here is a tutorial on how to do so. http://wiki.przemoc.net/tips/linux#mounting_partition_from_vdi_fixed-size_image Also see: http://srackham.wordpress.com/cloning-and-copying-virtualbox-virtual-machines/\n", "Q: How do I un-install Ubuntu TV Before I jump into the deep end of the pool and install this wonderful looking media app. My concerns are it's stability and my ability to revert my system back to it's pre-ubuntuTV state. \nAre there any detailed 'un-install' instructions? or is my best bet to just do a complete backup and restore if anything goes amuk?\n\nA: If it has been packaged correctly, by installing UbuntuTV using the deb package from webupd8, you should (in theory) be able to ppa-purge the PPA and this would restore your system.\ni.e.\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:nilarimogard/test3\nsudo apt-get remove unity-lens-video\n\nIf you see the following error message sudo: ppa-purge: command not found then install the ppa-purge package:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge \n\nHowever, as all PPAs are potentially destructive, a drive-image would be prudent to make, especially as UbuntuTV makes underlying changes to Ubuntu2D.\nI've done some limited testing installing and ppa-purge the package.  From initial testing, ubuntu-2D works correctly after uninstalling - i.e. the same packages upgraded to v5 are downgraded to v4.x that is standard in oneiric.\nHowever - the warning should be still applicable - drive-image your hard-drive.  Use it as an excuse to perform that regular backup procedure we all keep putting off... :)\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu TV on my computer?\n\nA: There are good instructions both for installing and uninstalling Ubuntu TV at www.WebUpd8.org, HERE.

I'm an idiot, I was writing an image to a USB drive using dd when instead of typing /dev/sdb I typed /dev/sdd and wrote the 135mb image to my 750gb External Hardrive full of files. Is there ANY possibility of recovering the files or did dd completely zero out the drive? Please help, as this is one of the lowest points of my life EVER.\ndd finished writing the 135mb image in 5 seconds, so I didn't have a chance to stop it. By the time I knew what happened to was too late. The command was as follows: \nsudo dd if=generic.img of=/dev/sdd bs=1M\n\nEDIT2: The External Harddrive's filesystem was FAT32(I've had the drive for awhile and FAT32 was the most Universal FS at the time). I also have a 2TB drive I just got which I was planning on moving most of the files to from the 750gb, If needed I can use it to transfer the Recovered files to.\n\nA: When a drive has been accidentally overwritten you will need Data Recovery Tools to restore the remainders of your data. When this has occured from running dd for a 135 MB image then those parts of your drive are definitely gone and can not be rescued.\nBy installing\nTestDisk \nyou may be able to recover part of your files. Included in the TestDisk suite you will also find the tool PhotoRec that helps to recover individual files even in the case the partitions can not be restored by testdisk or the drive itself has a hardware defect.\nTestDisk/PhotoRec can also be run on an image of your drive (as was also suggested by this answer)\n\nA: You can try to recover files from your HD with foremost. Foremost will try to recover only certain types of files (jpg, doc, rar, zip, htm, bmp, and quite a few others), though, so I believe it won't help to recover everything.\nBasically, what I would try to do is:\nsudo foremost -v -t all -i /dev/sdd -o ~/DISK_RECOVERY_FOLDER\n\nWhile the command scans all your sdd HD, cross your fingers (even though it will take quite a bit)\nOptionally, you can dd your whole 750Gb HD to some greater drive with enough space and run foremost on that image file, instead (not that foremost writes it, though.... just for speed if you want to run several recovery tools on that image). Something like_\nsudo dd -if=/dev/sdd -of=image.dd\n\nand change the foremost command to:\nsudo foremost -v -t all -i image.dd -o ~/DISK_RECOVERY_FOLDER\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: DD AFAIK writes the files contiguously so you lost whatever was in the first 750 mb of your disk. \nI think the first thing to do would be try and backup the whole image if possible so that if you try one tool and it changes the file systems you can go to another tool and see if it gets better results. \nTo backup the whole disk image you might need another 750gb harddrive to copy the image to. I would use a live CD/USB of clonezilla and copy the files to backup the whole disk image.\nOne of the tools I had a lot of successful with recovering partition tables is testdisk .  I would recommend using the System Rescue CD and boot using it using a CD or a USB. One thing to remember boot with 64-bit system rescue if you had a 64-bit operating system installed, because if the / partition is fully available it will possible to chroot and fix the setup only using similar kernels. \nBoot into system rescue CD and run testdisk.Using the menu choose analyse and see if it find the partition table. I would think you would need to run the deeper search for to find the partition table by brute force and it might not succeed in detecting the partition type of the first partition. So give it a name and try recover the partition tables. and then backup recovered files. \nEdit: Now finding that it is fat32, I think it would be easier that what I thought as there would be many fat recovery tools. You can use them to generate the fat table and the directories structure and specific file could be recovered using tools like photorec.\nubuntu rescue remix has photorec  and testdisk both. \nEdit: added information for cloning disk contents of the hard drive.\n\nA: I'd recommend a computer forensic tool, like SleuthKit to read through the remains of your disk structure, and figure out what looks like structure, and what looks like data, and help you recover.\n\nA: I agree with fellow community members here,testdisk,foremost and sleuthkit. And also you can also try extcarve www.giis.co.in/giis/. Most important thing, before you try any/all of these tool.Make sure you backup all your 750GB usb to the new 2TB drive and then start running them. You said,external drive has lot of files. It that any specific files like mp3 doc etc or just collection of whole lot of things. \n", "Q: Choppy video playback 11.10 I just installed 11.10 and I also installed the ATI prop. driver. Whenever I try to play a mkv file in mplayer, smplayer, or vlc, it is choppy. And in the case of VLC the audio is messed up also. Any way to fix this?\n\nA: You could try installing the driver from the ati website (if you haven't done so already). Follow these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI\n\nA: You need to install xvba-va driver and then enable GPU acceleration in VLC codecs.\n", "Q: Is there a way to stop Chrome/Firefox record history of a 'particular' website? I want Chrome/Firefox NOT to record history of a  'particular' website. Is it possible to do so?

When navigating to a listed domain, the tab will open in a new incognito window.\n\nA: This isn't the exact solution you want, but I couldn't find another way to do it more in line with the original question.\nChrome\nThe solution is to use incognito mode.

Sometimes a sudo aptitude upgrade fails and sudo aptitude upgrade --full-resolver then wants to remove about 100 Packages, because of \"dependecy conflicts\".\nOften I can then start update-manager and it offers me a \"Teilweise Systemaktualisierung\" (roughly \"partially distribution upgrade\"), when I run this then all packages are updated and it does this without removing any packages in most cases.\nSince I want to avoid using graphical tools for this kind of stuff, my question is: is there a way to start the \"partially dist-upgrade\" via command line? Prefferably with aptitude?\n\nA: I generally also dist-upgrade by default. And when it wants to remove crazy amounts of packages, I either say no repeatedly until it comes up with a sane solution, or I switch to aptitude upgrade.\nAptitude's interactive mode can also be a handy way to get around complex conflict situations (just run aptitude to launch it.)\nSometimes apt-get comes up with better solutions by default (in apt-get one doesn't get the chance to reject solutions).\n\nA: Often switching to apt-get in this situation can help you out. Next time this happens, try apt-get upgrade or even apt-get dist-upgrade. Historically this wasn't advisable because aptitude and apt-get used different databases, but these days that isn't an issue.\nAs always, make sure to read the solution that is being proposed to you (especially if you dist-upgrade as this may remove packages). One advantage of aptitude (and why I generally use it first) is that you get to reject solutions and choose your own if you want to. apt-get does not have this facility so it is more difficult to play with if the solution it gives you isn't one you want. Unfortunately aptitude doesn't get developed very much these days (hopefully this will change again in the future) so we may have to rely on apt-get more and more in the future.\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu is oriented to programming and robotics? server, desktop or other distro? Well, rather than a question is an opinion from you, it goes well,\nWhat version of ubuntu is better oriented programming to robotics or anything related to programming languages ​​(like C, perl, c + +, java, etc..?) I have read on other forums that say Ubuntu (desktop) is unstable , EYE I mean when you start playing the system configuration files and goes crazy.\nAlso not sure if ubuntu server is most convenient for programming, robotics and stuff or if other distros are better for it as mint, fedora, suse, or debian arch, and then based on their experience and knowledge I would like to give their opinions regarding this.\nGreetings (:\n\nA: There \"under the hood\" difference between ubuntu flavours is very minor. All flavors use the same archive (use the same packages). Each flavor is basically just a set of default installed packages. You can install all flavors concurrently, or switch between them, by adding and removing packages.\nSo, no, there's no good reason to install \"Ubuntu Server\" if you are intending to use the machine as a desktop, and vice-versa.\n\nA: For robotics you would be interested in installing ROS (Robot Operating System). As pointed out, there isn't a big difference between Desktop and Server besides the default packages. Since Desktop is geared to GUI-based applications, it would be better for running robot simulations. \n\nA: As the other poster said, all of the linux \"flavors\" are very similar at the core. Some, like puppy linux, are small enough to boot straight from a flash drive, and others, such as ubuntu, offer what you might call an easier to use UI and design, though larger in size. Ubuntu, and other distros I assume, come built in with a python interpreter you can run straight from the terminal. You can also compile and run C/C++ files straight from the terminal, as long as you have the right packages installed, gcc I believe. There are also plenty of IDEs you can install such as Code::Blocks, Eclipse, KDevelop, NetBeans and etc. \n", "Q: gtk applications in kubuntu 11.10 I check \nGTK+ in Kubuntu apps look bad\nand configure all by recommendations \n\n\nbut oxygen-gtk theme does not affect the appearance\n\nA: I have posted a complement to the question you linked to.\nThis application on the first screenshot is probably using GTK3, while the original instructions only apply to GTK2. I posted over there a link to a site that gives instructions for fixing GTK3. I'm not posting here too because I'm not sure if this would be considered duplication.\n\nA: Now that you have gtk3-engines-oxygen installed you need to do another step; inside ~/.config/ create a new directory with gtk-3.0 as it's name, then inside that directory create a new file, name it settings.ini  inside that file put this: \n [Settings]\ngtk-theme-name = oxygen-gtk\n\nSave and close, then you must be able to see gtk applications very well integrated with oxygen theme. If not, open systemsettings again, go to  GTK appearance and reselect the oxyge-gtk theme, save settings. Now you should be able to see good looking GTK applications. \nThis worked for me as far I compiled the oxygen-gtk theme from it's lastest tarball, maybe you won't need that but if the latter isn't working for you, you should consider compiling. \nHope this helps!

I never used workspaces, so I have set number of workspaces to 1. \nAfter restarting, unity seems to be kinda snappier. \nWhat`s in theory?\n\nA: With anything resembling modern hardware or more then 1 Gb of ram you are not going to notice a performance hit.\nIf you wish, run top in a terminal and add a work space. Top will show you the changes in ram and cup use. You will likely see a bit of a change as you add the workspace, or if you switch workspaces.

Using laptop for browsing and programming.\n\nA: While I realize that I am late for the party, I am putting my 2 cents for future readers. If I was in your shoes, I would opt for the Intel Core i3 processor. Sandy Bridge has been a magnificent line of processors, all of which where great all around performers. \nAs for the performance of the two, it may look like the i3 is crippled with only 2 physical cores and 2 logical via Hyperthreading, however you have to note that the i3 2100 was (in many) benchmarks surpassing the amd fx 4100 performance, which is a chip from the bulldozer architecture, known to be superior to Llano architecture, unless you take into account the integrated graphics of the Llano architecture.\nSome discussion on this:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/329695-10-intel-core-2100-fx4100\n\n*http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fx-4100-core-i3-2100-gaming-benchmark,3136-9.html\n\n*http://www.overclock.net/t/1266084/amd-fx-4100-vs-core-i3-2100\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 12.04 on an Intel atom netbook. If you talk about speed, don't worry because Ubuntu is perfect on every processor. \nIt works (very, very, very well) on my netbook, and with every hardware, webcam, all usb ports, touchpad. Even much better then with Windows 7.\nIf your budget is not quite small, buy a laptop, then install a Samsung SSD 125Gb (150$ max). Ubuntu at startup is a bomb on the SSD. Not talking about the speed on the programs :D\n\nA: They are nearly the same. The only thing that matters whether all the hardware is recognized by ubuntu. If you can try the laptops with a live cd, bring one, and test.\nPersonally I think AMD did a great job with the Liano platform, it preforms better when it comes to graphics, 3D rendering, HD movies and it even has nice Turbo speeds.\nAlso it has 4 physical cores, and Intel i3 has only 2 physical + 2 virtual (HT).

I have 3 HDDs in RAID0 and a spare HDD where I chose for Ubuntu. The error said that GRUB cannot be installed on drive named \"sda\", therefore I picked \"sdd\" from the list, which was the HDD with Ubuntu on it. As I went through the list of drives, I noticed a few volumes with \"mapper\" in their name, which I assumes is the RAID0. Afterwards, even though it was installed on a separate drive, I had to use the /fixmbr windows recovery to be able to boot into windows.\nMy question is, why did it still affect windows if it was installed on a separate drive? When it was trying to install on \"sda\", does that mean it might have corrupted my windows partition and data? \n\nA: Nothing should have gone wrong if I understand your situation correctly. Sometimes it is easy to confuse which HDD you are installing on - hence why you got GRUB on the wrong HDD.\nIf you have fixed the mbr of Windows, then you should not have any other problems.\n", "Q: Setting up VNC via Putty Ubuntu 10.4.2 LTS I have just setup my server with ubuntu desktop, after running the sudo apt-get install-desktop, and rebooting I now want to login to the dektop remotely, from my Windows PC. \nHow do I enable remote VNC / Teamviewer access via the SSH command line? \n\nA: One alternate would be to use FreeNX .

The easiest it to run ssh vino-preferences from a linux LiveCD. You can use vino-passwd to set the password.\nAlternative is to install x11vnc (from x11vnc package). No need gui to configure. Just install and run it from the putty window.\nIf you are not logged as a user on that ubuntu box, then you will need to do some tricks with X cookie permissions. It is described in error message from the x11vnc command (just the file path is bit different in Ubuntu). Sorry, I don't remember the details, but it wasn't difficult.\nIt is better (safer) to start vnc server only on 127.0.0.1 and tunnel it over secure SSH tunnel (there are options for that in putty).\nGood luck.\n", "Q: 1080p choppy on two different GPUs, what else could it be?

The Gnome Panel settings are at org.gnome.gnome-panel.\nAs DConf saves its data in binary form to improve performance you can't edit the settings  by hand but need to use  the command line tools gsettings (package libglib2.0-bin) or dconf (package dconf-tools) or the GUI dconf-editor (package dconf-tools) to view or edit them.\n", "Q: What is the best way to keep two bzr repositories in sync? I would like to keep a bzr repository in sync between my laptop and desktop. Is there any special tool to accomplish this, or should I just use rsync? I would absolutely love it if I could get one that would automatically synchronize and let the newer version win. \n\nA: One option would be to make the the repository in one location \"bound\" to the other. With this option, bzr acts more like a tradition vcs than a dvcs. Each commit in the \"bound\" branch is automatically pushed to its parent. Though this is generally designed with the idea that the parent will not have working trees. As I imagine you want to hack on both your laptop and desktop, that's not the case.

And made sure that grub-efi-amd64 package is present, and I ran sudo grub-install /dev/sda command. That also led to the same error. Then I tried the solution given here and here. That also gave same error. fdisk -ul /dev/sda shows that boot partition (/dev/sda1) is a msdos partition. /dev/sda6 is root partition and /dev/sda9 is the home partition. So, how can I solve this issue?\n\nA: It's been almost four months, but if you still need a solution, my recommendation is to switch to a different boot loader. In my experience, GRUB 2 (which Ubuntu uses by default) is the least reliable of the common EFI boot loaders for Linux. Given that you're dual-booting with Windows, you're probably best off with either Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy or a combination of ELILO and either rEFInd or rEFIt. Of these, you can do the combination of ELILO and rEFIt using Ubuntu packages, but you'll need to do some manual configuration, and Ubuntu's rEFIt package has some bugs on UEFI-based PCs. (It works better on Macs.) Thus, you'll probably have to go beyond the packaging system to manually download either GRUB Legacy or rEFInd.\n\nA: I had the same problem “invalid arch independent ELF magic”.\nI was installing from a USB stick booted from the Bios in UEFI mode.\nAfter a couple a couple unsuccessful reinstallation of 12.04,I tried the same installation with the the USB stick booted without the UEFI mode and it works.\nFor your information my setting on a 120GB SSD\nsda1 /windows 90 GB   windows 7 64bits\nsda2 /boot  100 MB\nsda5 swap     1 GB\nsda6 /        18GB   ubuntu 12.04\nsda7 /home     8GB\nMy motherboard is P8P67 Pro with Asus EZbios and I had two choices in my boot menu for the USB with 12.04 installation.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Is there a Printer Driver for a Fuji Xerox Docu Print CM205B Laser Printer?

Does ubuntu 11.10 have a repair setup like windows that repairs the operating system files? Or do we have to do a whole new installation? \nIf not, is there a backup solution so I can re-install Ubuntu and just use the backup file to put all my programs back etc?\n\nA: There is a 'Recovery Mode' boot option on startup;\n\nThis mode just loads some basic services and drops you into command\n  line mode. You are then logged in as root (the superuser) and can\n  repair your system using command line tools.\n\nReference\nUnlike a Windows recovery it will not automatically fix any errors - you will need to use command line tools and understand exactly what you are doing to repair your installation. \nAs Michael K suggested you can also use a live CD to recover an installation but once again you must know what you are doing and use command line tools to carry out the repair. There is a good Ubuntu Documentation page on Live CD Recovery that I recommend you have a read through to get a good understanding of what is required and how to use it.\nA third option is to do a re-install of the operating system but do not format and just 'overwrite' your existing installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the install media and go through the install process as usual.\n\n*When you get to the partitioner to allocate drive space, depending on the version you are installing check the box marked 'Manually select partitions'  or 'Something else' and click forward. Use the SAME user name and password as the existing account when setting up again. \n\n*Find your existing installation and you must UNCHECK all the 'format' boxes and mount the partitions in the same place they are now.\n\n\nAs long as no 'format' boxes are checked, no data will be lost in your home folder and the system files will be overwritten with the originals. You should then complete all system updates again.\nRegardless of what option you choose to use to try and recover an installation you should regularly back up your important documents and files so that you can restore them if needed. \nRead through the answers to Comparison of backup tools for a comprehensive list of recommendations.\n\nA: With Ubuntu 12.10, the third option given by Mark Rooney has been greatly simplified.\nWhen you start the install process, once you get to the format wizard screen, a new option appears at the top if an existing installation is detected. It just asks if you would like to re-install the current installation, and will preserve your files and, where possible, your installed programs.\n\nA: Restore Ubuntu without reinstalling:\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu live USB.\n\n\n*Click Try Ubuntu.\n\n\n*Open the terminal.\n\n\n*df -h (To find out the name of your partition that you want to restore.

I wish to install Ubuntu as the second OS. I want that at startup I am prompted to select the OS I wish to boot my system with. \nHowever, I am facing problems while creating the new partitions. My hard drive is presently partitioned into two drives, both of which contain data although there is 30GB of free space available in both the partitions.\nI am a little apprehensive about losing my data if I partition my drive incorrectly during Ubuntu installation. \nKindly guide me through the installation procedure, especially the partitioning part of it. Which option would be best suited?\n\nA: I think you just need to take a look at these two official guides here, to easily install Ubuntu after Windows XP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu after Windows\n\n*How to resize Windows partitions\nOr you can use this complete guide for Ubuntu 11.10.\nWhen you finish the installation, Ubuntu will automatically generate the boot options to let you choose which operating system to start, Windows or Ubuntu.\nIf you are apprehensive about losing your data, you can backup them into an external hard disk before starting the installation.\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu will automatically create a dual-boot menu (GRand Unified Bootloader - GRUB2) that will allow you to select between Ubuntu and XP.  \nYou can easily install Ubuntu into the area of free space on one of your hard disks.  One way to do this, and specify the disk/free space with certainty, is to set up the root and swap areas manually.  Some details on how to do so are provided at http://linuxnorth.wordpress.com/manual-partitioning/.  The posting also includes references to related sources of information, including video tutorials.\n", "Q: Why is there no Recycle Bin? Why doesn't Ubuntu have their Recycle bin/Trash function the same as Windows.\nIn Ubuntu there is Trash folder, which functions exactly as a folder. There is no disk space difference after a file has been Trashed. However In Windows, it appears available memory will increase if I move file(s) to the Recycle bin.\n\nA: Try putting the location \ntrash:///\ninto the file manager (Nautilus). For example, from the command prompt:\n$ nautilus trash:///\n\nwill open up the file manager at that location.\nThe physical location of the file is:\n~/.local/share/Trash \n\n(i.e. /home/username/.local/share/Trash)\nThere are two subfolders, files and info, which contain the files, an the information about them (original location, deletion date/time).\nThis works pretty much the same way as in Windows\n\nA: Windows simply lies about the remaining disk space, the space isn't actually cleared until you empty the bin. As a challenge, find a small hard drive and install windows. Fill 98% of the remaining space with a large file and then send it to the recycling bin. Windows will report that the free space has been reclaimed, yet the file is still in the bin and can be restored. \nNow create another large file and recheck the recycling bin, notice something missing? Windows silently removes items from the recycling bin when there isn't enough free disk space to continue its deception.\nA la Microsoft: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/136517\n\nA: I am a bit puzzled. Ubuntu does have a recycle bin (called either Trash or Rubbish Bin).\nWhen you delete a file or folder from Nautilus, it goes to the Rubbish Bin. You can go to the bin and right-click and restore. Or, you can empty your Rubbish Bin if you wish to reclaim the space.\nWindows is just the same. When you put something in the recycle bin, your hard disk space is not reduced, because it's still there on the disk. Your disk space is reduced only when you empty the bin.\n\nA: Ubuntu does have a Recycle Bin, it's called the Trash.\nAlso, I'm not sure what you mean by \"memory\" in this case. Memory (as in RAM) is not used with file operations like moving things to the Trash.\n", "Q: Why does mouse cursor disappear randomly over background image and desktop icons and sometimes foreground windows?

Currently I don't seem able to run multiple sessions of byobu. After the initial byobu instance, running on one terminal,  when I run byobu in another terminal it always attaches to the first byobu session. \nIs there away to start independent byobu sessions?\n\nA: Use the -S option to give your next byobu session (e.g. its socket) a different name. Without -S \"MYNAME\" the socket would be <pid>.<tty>.<host> instead of <pid>.MYNAME.\n\nA: As far as I can work out, if you run byobu with no arguments then it reattaches to an existing session (or starts a new one if you aren't running byobu at all). If you run it with a program name as the argument then it will pass this to either screen or tmux, depending on what you are running inside.\nIf you're running screen, you can simulate starting a fresh session (executing your shell) by running byobu byobu-shell (byobu-shell being the program that byobu launches by defualt. It prints the MOTD and launches your $shell.). Then when you try to reattach, either by running byobu or reconnecting via SSH to the server, you'll be given a menu with options to choose between the running byobu sessions.\nFor tmux, execute byobu new-session to achieve this. The next time you reconnect you'll be attached to the last session you started.\n\nA: It is very easy. (At least on my ubuntu 10.04 machine, where byobu uses screen.);\nIf you already have one session running, and do not want to reattach but instad create a new one, just type:\nbyobu -S my-other-session\n\nWhere my-other-session is how you are naming the new session.\nLater, if you have already more than one byobu sessions running, it is sufficient to type\nbyobu\n\nAnd you will be presented with a list of running sessions to choose from:\nByobu sessions...\n\n  1.  17680.my-other-session (03/12/2012 01:33:32 PM) (Detached)\n  2.  11890.pts-2.mit        (01/15/2012 09:17:49 AM) (Detached)\n  3.  Create a new session\n\nChoose 1-3 [1]:\n\nIf typing byobu dos not present a list of running sessions to choose from, try the byobu-select-session command.\nThe pts-2.mit session was the one I created initially without giving it a name, so the name was chosen by boybu.\nIf you want to find out which sessions are running, without attaching to any of them, use\nbyobu -ls\n\nIt drops you again at the console where you typed it after showing a list like:\nThere are screens on:\n        17680.my-other-session  (03/12/2012 01:33:31 PM)        (Detached)\n        11890.pts-2.mit         (01/15/2012 09:17:48 AM)        (Detached)\n2 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-root.\n\n\nA: Or, when you are inside a byobu session already: Ctrl+Shift+F12.\n\nA: If you're connecting to a machine using ssh and you'd like to create a new byobu session, use:\nssh -t hostname byobu new-session\n\nNote: The -t flag is needed to \"Force pseudo-terminal allocation\" otherwise you get the following error: \"open terminal failed: not a terminal\"\nOnce you have created the new session on a machine on any subsequent connection you'll be asked which byobu session you'd like to attach to.\n", "Q: How to get a mustek 1248 UB scanner working?

I have a domain test.dev bound to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts. How can I bind all the subdomains, e.g. any.th.ing.test.dev to 127.0.0.1 as well? \n\nA: This is actually dead-simple with dnsmasq:\n# install dnsmasq\nsudo apt-get install dnsmasq\n# map anything ending in .dev to 127.0.0.1\necho address=/dev/127.0.0.1 | sudo tee /etc/dnsmasq.d/dev\n# restart to make it read new config\nsudo service dnsmasq restart\n# verify it's working\nhost gsdf.gsd.fg.sdf.g.dev                               \n# gsdf.gsd.fg.sdf.g.dev has address 127.0.0.1\n\n\nA: /etc/hosts (where you'd make an edit) doesn't allow wildcards. This leaves you with two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do without automatic subsdomains and just edit /etc/hosts each time you want a new one.\n\n*Push all your DNS through a crazy DNS proxy (per this answer) and change your network settings to the proxy. This will likely slow anything that makes a DNS query down a little but should let you do anything you like with domains.\nI personally settle for just setting them myself. It only takes 10 seconds. But you might have different, stranger requirements.\n\nEdit: Just had an idea. If you have a real domain (with real DNS hosting) you could set *.local.mydomain.com to point to 127.0.0.1 and that should work.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One files are downloaded but not available after Purchasing some Music on the U1 Music Store the files were synced from u1 to the computer where I purchased the Albums (Ubuntu 11.04).\nOn a different machine (Ubuntu 11.10) only some Tracks are synced and showing up the rest is not there. u1sdtool --current-transfers Was listing some of the missing files.

I have installed tomcat on my Ubuntu Home 11.10 system and can successfully access the test page online after port forwarding on 8080 within my router.\nI have not made any other changes to the router, Ubuntu or the tomcat install, everything else has remained standard. I intend on using this to play around with Java Servlets and basic web development for my own personal use.\nWhat steps, if any, would you suggest I take to ensure this is secure? Should I change anything within the Tomcat configuration?\nThis seemed like a good idea to limit access - http://www.seankilleen.com/2010/09/how-to-allow-only-specific-ip-addresses_30.html\nBut I am open to any other recommendations.\n\nA: The Solution\nUse Tomcat to block all connections with the exception of administrator IP Addresses (which were static to us and known).\nThe Steps\nOpen the context.xml file, located in [Tomcat]\\conf\\context.xml, where [Tomcat] is the base location of your Tomcat server.\nIf you've never edited this file before, you should see a line like the following:\n    <WatchedResource>WEB-INF/web.xml</WatchedResource>\n\nAdd the following line directly after the  tag:\n    <Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve\"    allow=\"IP1|IP2|IP3\"/>\n\n...where IP1, IP2, IP3, etc. are the IP addresses you would like to allow.\nRestart the Tomcat server.\n\nNotes on How it Works\nThis valve uses regular expressions, so if you decided to get fancy with it, you certainly could (provided you know a little about Java Regular Expressions). For our purposes, the pipe (\"|\") character in-between the IP addresses works as an \"or\" operator. If the Remote Address Value matches any of these full strings, it is allowed.\nNote that by default, this denies every other connection.\nIf you'd like to allow all connections except certain IP addresses, you can change the \"allow\" attribute to \"deny\"; all connections will be allowed except those in the deny attribute, which still uses Java regular expressions.\nTo my knowledge, this \"valve\" structure can't be stacked. That is to say, you can't do a \"deny all\" valve and then stack multiple types of \"allow valves\" on top of it. If anyone knows if this is possible, feel free to sound off in the comments.\nHope this helps!\nsource\n", "Q: Is it possible to accept wired phone call (RJ11)? I have a Toshiba laptop with Ubuntu 11.10 installed, all works fine. If I connect a wired phone (RJ11) into the RJ11 slot in my laptop and someone calls that phone, is it possible to accept a phone call from within Ubuntu and use the laptop microphone/speakers to communicate?\n\nA: Since you mentioned RJ11 this likely means you have a standard modem in your computer, this usually means that you need a softphone sometimes called a telephony application that uses the modem to accept and initiate calls using PSTN.\nIf you can find any such application for Ubuntu that you can install and run properly, what you ask may work, I do not know of any such application I could point you to, and if you are lucky to find anything it will likely be very old.\nWhat is happening nowadays is that VOIP based softphones such as Skype and Ekiga has taken the focus, these phones use packet based methods to communicate meaning that they use your Internet connection to send and receive packets as opposed to a switched network.\nWhen you say all works fine I suppose you mean the modem as well, in short If you do not have a telephony application that uses PSTN running or you modem does not work with Ubuntu then no.\n\nA: There are few discussions with respect to this but they all seem to stop in 2006.\nThe most recent post I have found is:\nhttp://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=111225\nBut again this one is from 2006.\nCan I ask why not just use VOIP?\n", "Q: Linux set time from net at login On my Ubuntu 10.04 box I (a user, not root) can issue \nsudo net time set\n\nand it works great.\nI'd prefer that the box get the net time on a more regular basis, or at least each time it gets logged in.  So, I tried adding net time set to /etc/profile.  That fails.  I added stanzas that look like\nuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/net\n\nto /etc/sudoers (using visudo).  Didn't help.\nI have never touched cron so I have no idea how to add a chron tab.  (does seem oxymoronic to depend on the system time to reset the system time.)\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the best way to do this?\n\n*If it's a cron job, I'd appreciate a quick example.   \n\n*Same questions but for the command service dhcp3-server restart?\n\n\n(yes, my box gets its address by dhcp, but its dhcp server controls 4 gigabit enet cards attached to high speed cameras.  Sometimes, at login? bootup? the dhcp server leaves me seeing only 1 camera.)\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Don't bother.\nThe usual way to keep the system clock synchronized is ntpd. It should be installed and configured by default on Ubuntu. Do you have an ntpd process running? Is your system's clock incorrect?\nEDIT :\nFrom your comment on my other answer, it looks like you've got an NTP server you can use.\nYou should already have the ntp software installed on your system.  dpkg -l ntp to verify.  You probably have an ntpd daemon already running, though it won't work because it doesn't know what server to talk to; ps -ef | grep ntpd to confirm that.\n/etc/ntp.conf is the configuration file for ntp.  The default version has:\nserver 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org\nserver 1.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org\nserver 2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org\nserver 3.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org\n\nComment out those lines and add:\nserver your.ntp.server\n\nthen run:\nsudo /etc/init.d ntp restart\n\nman ntpd for more details, but this should be enough to get you going.\n\nA: (Yes, I'm adding a second answer.)\nFrom your description, you've added the appropriate line to /etc/sudoers, but you're not invoking sudo in /etc/profile.\nThe command in /etc/profile needs to be:\nsudo net time set\n\nNote that this will run every time any account logs in.  Is that what you want, or would it make more sense to put the command in $HOME/.profile?\nTo make it a cron job, you can add something like this:\n0 * * * * *      sudo net time set\n\nto, say, foo.txt, then crontab foo.txt.  After that, crontab -l will show you your current cron job(s).  With the given parameters, the job will run once an hour; man 5 crontab and adjust as needed.  There might be some issues because cron jobs run with a minimal environment, but I don't think /usr/bin/net depends on any environment variables.\nNote that, unlike ntpd, this can cause your system's clock to jump backwards, which can cause problems.\n", "Q: telnet refusing traffic on arbitrary port over network in 11.10 I have written a python script to listen on port 2626 and executed the script.\nproof that localhost is listening\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:2626          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN\n\nI can connect via telnet to this port over localhost with the following command:\n:~$ telnet localhost 2626\nTrying ::1...\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\nConnected to localhost.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n\nHowever when I try to connect from a remote machine the connection gets refused.\n :~$ telnet 128.251.xxx.xxx 2626\n Trying 128.251.xxx.xxx...\n telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\n\nI even issued the following command to accept traffic on port 2626:\n sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 2626 -j ACCEPT\n\nWhat could be the reason telnet on port 2626 is refusing connections from remote machines and how can I fix it?\n\nA: That output shows that your program is listening on 127.0.0.1 only. Listening sockets (open ports) are either bound to a specific interface, as in this case, or to all interfaces (in which case you'll see 0.0.0.0 as a notation for 'any address'). The implications of binding to 127.0.0.1 only are that only connections through that interface will go to the listening socket, and hence your program. If you're using python's socket library, either bind to your external IP in the bind() call, or bind to all IPs, something like this:\n>>> import socket\n>>> s = socket.socket()\n>>> s.bind(('', 6666))\n>>> s.listen(1)\n\nwhich gives the result you want from netstat\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6666            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN\n\nand indeed can be connected to from another machine\nial@roach> telnet polihale 6666\nTrying 128.243.20.139...\nConnected to polihale.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n\n\nA: The 127.0.0.1:2626 from the netstat output indicates that your python script is only accepting connections on 127.0.0.1. If you wish to be able to accept connections from any address, have it accept connections on 0.0.0.0\n", "Q: How do I install the Instant Messaging application IP Messenger? I've recently downloaded g2ipmsg (IP Messenger for Ubuntu 11.10).\nHowever - this comes not as an installable package as previous ubuntu versions.\nThus I think I need to compile it. This application needs gtk so I've installed libgtk2.0-dev using Synaptic Package Manager.\nNow when I run ./configure command it gives me the following error.\n\nchecking for APPLET... configure: error: Package requirements (libpanelapplet-2.0) were >not met:\n\nNo package 'libpanelapplet-2.0' found\n\nConsider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you\ninstalled software in a non-standard prefix.\n\nAlternatively, you may set the environment variables APPLET_CFLAGS and\nAPPLET_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config. See the pkg-config\nman page for more details.\n\nWhere can I find the path for PKG_CONFIG_PATH?\nThis is what I have done so far:\nI've installed libxml-parser-perl, libgnomeui-dev, gettext, intltool according to the post\nInstalling IP messenger on Ubuntu linux but could not find the package libpanel-applet2-dev.\nThen I even tried to install libpanelappletmm-2.6-dev and libpanelappletmm-2.6-1c2 but could not find this packages\nbut still get the same error \nconfigure: error: Package requirements (libpanelapplet-2.0) were not met\n\nThere are lot of problems with g2ipmsg in ubuntu, specially there are lot of problems during file transfer.\nInstead of installing Ip messanger using wine or g2ipmsg use Iptux.\nIts perfectly compatible with Ip Messanger.\nInstalling Iptux\nsudo apt-get install iptux\n\nA: When you see an error message like that from pkg-config (\"No package 'foo' found\"), that means that the file foo.pc cannot be found by pkg-config. The usual reason for this is that you don't have the package which provides this file installed, so you should search either using apt-file or on packages.ubuntu.com for it. In this specific case however, you'll get no results because the old GNOME 2 panel applets have all been removed.\nIf you pass --disable-applet to ./configure, you should be able to get past this step.\n\nA: The package g2ipmsg is available in the repositories - v0.9.6 for all versions of ubuntu except for oneiric.  Thus to install in versions prior to oneiric or for 12.04 and above:\ng2ipmsg \nHowever its not available in Oneiric (11.10) because it doesnt compile under oneiric due to the changes to Gnome-Panel and the dependency on the gnome-2 applet libraries.\nYou could compile and install to produce this result in gnome-classic (no-effects)\n\nNote - when the application starts - it starts minimised to the gnome-panel.  For some reason, in Unity, this application does not appear - probably the minimised application is not directly visible in the Unity panel.\nTo get the application to work under Unity you need to enable the old sys-tray:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\n\nThen logout and login before searching for g2ipmsg in Dash\nI've compiled and added this to my PPA.  If you wish to compile this yourself, then instructions are below.\nInstall from PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:fossfreedom/g2ipmsg\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install g2ipmsg\n\nto run g2ipmsg\n\n*\n\n*If you are using the Gnome-Classic interface, then G2ipmsg will be found in the Accessories menu option\n\n*If you are using Gnome-Shell then search in Activities for g2ipmsg and the application will start minimized in the system-tray notification area (bottom right) of the screen.

How do I get rid of that problem? I am running a Samba Server (Version 3.5.6). The file sharing is OK until I realize that Samba changes file ownership when another user (not the original owner) edit the file and saves it. This is particularly true, if I have set admin users parameter to administrate the share.\nThe strange thing is only the file ownership get changed but 'directory ownership' remain unchanged (which is desirable) :)\nOptions like force user and force group are not going to work here because, sharing directory have a different sub-directories that belong to many users.\nConfiguration for the share looks like this\n[staff]\n    comment = \"Staff members only\"\n    path = /path/to/staff\n    browseable = yes\n    valid users = @staff, @managers, @moderators\n    write list = @staff, @managers\n    create mask = 0640\n    directory mask = 0750\n    admin users = @moderators`\n\nAs you can see, members in above-mentioned groups are allowed to read others data but only members of @moderators can do changes to file & directories. \nProblem arises when a member of @moderators modifies a file (not a directory) that belong to another user (belong to @staff or @managers), the ownership of that edited  file changes to root!!! which is totally undesirable.\nI want to preserve the ownership of the file to its original creator even after a member of @moderators modifies it. How Do I Achieve This???\nThank you in advanced.\n\nA: Do not use \"admin users\" for the file modifications, because members of this setting operate as root on the filesystem. Quoting from smb.conf man page:\n\nadmin users (S)\n  This is a list of users who will be granted\n  administrative privileges on the share. This means that they will do\n  all file operations as the super-user (root). You should use this\n  option very carefully, as any user in this list will be able to do\n  anything they like on the share, irrespective of file permissions.\n\n", "Q: Would Ubuntu TV work outside USA when installed on a PC? I've seen the blurbs about Ubuntu TV being able to receive from cable and it has EPG and so on, and I'd love to install it on a regular PC that is currently running Windows Media Center.\nI don't merely want to have a media player; I specifically want to be able to watch and record live TV via a tuner expansion card. I have tried installing MythTV earlier, but I failed miserably because the instructions I used were US-centric but I'm in Austria (Europe). I couldn't find a way to make the TV tuner work right. \nI'm concerned that this time, again, Ubuntu TV will only work really well in the USA.\nGiven that I'm in non-US country \"X\", what are my chances of getting Ubuntu TV to work well, specifically with regard to receiving local-region EPG data and also aerial and cable TV signals in PAL and DVB-T formats?\n\nA: Firstly, UbuntuTV is currently a demonstration product. However, Canonical is a UK-based company with international appeal - the screenshots of the demonstration EPG have UK channel logos in them. The UK is in the process of converting to entirely digital TV broadcasting, so it would be odd for it not to be supported in the finished product.\nAs a UK MythTV user for over 5 years, DVB-T has worked really well for me. I found it much easier to set up than analogue tuner cards, especially in more recent releases of MythTV. It's also far less CPU hungry than using analog tuners.\nMy current MythTV installation is still running off the Mythbuntu Jaunty (9.04) release at this current time, and I'd expect it was even easier in newer releases. I'd encourage you to give MythTV another try, since UbuntuTV will not be released for some time.\n\nA: My guess is that it would work almost anywhere considering that Canonical is a international company and Ubuntu is a international community.\n", "Q: What is the best way to create secure/encrypted system? I want to set up a development machine.\nSince during the development there might be some sensitive data I will have to work on - intellectual property is the main issue. I would like to have a secure/encrypted system, so that if the machine gets into wrong hands, the data is still secure.\nSo the question is, how can I achieve that under Linux? I heard about TrueCrypt, but it seems that I can't do a boot time encryption. So I have to use some strategy with encrypted home folder + something else. In which case Ubuntu has something built in, no?\nBut the question is, how good is the built in system, and what happens with temp data, that is known to spill out of home directory into unencrypted directories.\nAnyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu on an encrypted partition using dm-crypt. The /boot partition needs to be unencrypted, but the entire rest of the disk will reside in one encrypted volume. Here is a nice how-to.\n\nA: what wallenborn suggests is the only way to achieve system encryption. I think you should follow the link he provides properly.\nAFAIK /boot partition is kept outside encryption because it holds the kernel image and grub cannot boot through an encrypted partition. You can just separate 100 to 200 MB space for /boot. The main thing you should remember is you need ubuntu alternate iso as the default desktop installer/iso provides only home encryption facility and not system encryption. \nI myself dual boot Arch and Ubuntu on LVM over LUKS and the encryption suport is quite nice and secure from my experience.\n", "Q: How to mount a zip file as a file system? Can I mount a zip (or other non-solid (so that accessing a file wouldn't decompress the whole archive) compressed archive format file) as a file system in Ubuntu?\n\nA: In Nautilus, right click on the archive and then click \"Open with Archive Mounter\", once you've done this, your archive will show up as a new “drive” in Nautilus. (check tutorial here)\n\nA: Install the package avfs then execute:\nmountavfs\n\nSay you have a zip file in ~/Documents/file.zip, then\ncd ~/.avfs/home/$USER/Documents\nls -l file.zip#/\n\nYou could also browse the content in Nautilus, but you need to add a trailing # character by hand to the path (Ctrl-L to access the address bar).\n\nA: fuse-zip is a fuse filesystem, that enables any program to work with a ZIP archive as though it is a plain directory.

Open terminal Ctrl+Alt+T and run following command: \nsudo apt-get install filezilla\n\nOr search on Filezilla in Ubuntu Software Center.\nWhen you add a host, be sure to change from FTP to SFTP, and change\nthe port number to ssh port 22 (or other custom ssh port if different)\nMake the account type interactive.\nEnjoy.\n\nA: There are many different tools which would give a similar experience as winscp. I use filezilla for transferring files across ssh. \nNautilus as mentioned by @sagarchalise allows for connecting to server. \nOne of the things I use more often these days to access sftp is sshfs. I find it very convenient as it mounts the files as local file in the filesystem and transparently updates it on the remote server. \nsshfs username@remotehostname.tld:/path/to/remote/files /path/to/local/mountpoint/\nIt lets me use all my usual tools assuming these file are local files.\n\nA: You could also use sshfs or rsync. \nsshfs mounts your remote directory locally over ssh very similar to WinSCP and Nautilus.\nThe potential advantage of sshfs is that you can map users\nsshfs -o idmap=server_user user@server:/directory ~/remote_directory\n\nTo automate the process, add an entry in fstab\nsshfs#user@server:/directory /home/your_local_user/directory fuse idmap=user 0 0\n\nSee Ubuntu Wiki SSHFS\nrsync will also sync files / directories and will work over ssh and has a graphical front end, grsync\nSee Ubuntu wiki rsync\nLast you can edit remote files with vim (if you are interested)\nvim scp://user@server//path_to/file_to_edit\n\n\nA: You can also try unison to help synchronize the two folders\n\nA: A very nice and powerful program, built over the rsync protocol, is Unison. \n\nIt has a very nice interface, and the client is available for at least Linux (more or less all variants) and Windows.

I have a desktop and a laptop both connected by cables to a router.\nI thought the computers were supposed to show up in Nautilus in the Network folder. That way I could then easily share files between them. They do not.\n\nA: Gnome 2 provides an easy way to share filesystems using sshfs. Essentially all that is needed is the OpenSSH server on the computer hosting the files (or both for two-way sharing). I'm not at a ubuntu machine right now because I'm at school, but if I remember correctly it should be as simple as going to Places → Connect… then selecting ssh and filling in the host's IP address.\nFor example, with host A at 10.0.0.1 and host B at 10.0.0.2 with the user user on both machines:\n(execute on both machines)\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\nifconfig\n\nBefore 16.10\nThen Places → Connect… fill in user for username, you password for the password and the IP address of the other computer (from ifconfig above).\nAfter 16.10\nOn the left side of Nautilus, click on + Other Locations.

There is nothing showing on the screen, and I can't access the server with a keyboard. Neither can I access it over SSH.\nIf I hold the power button down and force the computer to shut down, it will boot in to Ubuntu normally the next time. This only happens the time I run \"sudo reboot\", and not the following I start it.\nAs I said, I can't spawn a terminal on the server, not even if I connect a keyboard. It's like it's frozen.

See this answer: Black screen after updating Ubuntu 11.04 and Mobility HD 4250 which leads to the X/Troubleshooting/Blank screen Wiki, containing useful information to solve these issues. \nWhat I did to solve of GPU feeding data failure was editing the grub.cfg file by dropping the next in a terminal:\nsudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nAs mentioned on \"Workaround B\" in the Wiki page. Then remove the \"splash\" word on each grub's entry. And the problem was solved.\nYou can either edit grub.cfg file via Live Session with a CD/DVD or USB bootable. And there are some other workarounds that may help you.\nI hope you find a solution soon.\nGood luck!\n\nA: It sounds like something is trying to clean up when you reboot but is failing - when you hard-power-off, the shutdown script doesn't get run and so doesn't have a chance to mess things up.  You should be able to check the scripts in /etc/init.d and see if any of them fail when you stop them, especially with services that you've installed that aren't in the base ubuntu install.  You can manually stop services using:\nservice <whatever> stop\n\nAnd look at the output on screen or in the logfiles in /var/log.

You can usually just leave update-manager to receive your updates.\nPersonally, I leave alpha/beta updates once a week because you usually see many releases of the same package over a short period.\nI also separately maintain the ISO download via zsync.  In that way, if you need to trash the release, you can reload from a very recent snapshot rather than loading the last alpha/beta and updating from there.\nHang-out on the developers forum over at ubuntuforums.org.  You usually get wind of major issues quickly - that way you can make a judgment call when to best update.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I update an ISO with zsync?\n\nA: Just do the updates.

However, our new version is no longer compatible with the previous version, because of some fundamental changes. So version 2.8 should not be upgraded to 2.9. I specifically want to prevent users from upgrading to 2.9 by mistake. Instead if they want to upgrade, they should be forced to apt-get remove, and then apt-get install to get a fresh install.\nIs there a way to specify this in the package description? Or am I better of creating a separate repository or changing the name of the package?\n\nA: You should change the package name. Not only because there is no good way from your end to prevent an upgrade, but more importantly because users may want to have both versions installed during a transition period. E.g. install the new version, run it on test data for a while, then do the difficult data migration when they've stabilized the new configuration.\nHistorical example: Apache (I don't remember if Ubuntu had separate Apache 1 and Apache 2 at some point, but Debian definitely did).\n\nA: This is something that is probably best suited for #ubuntu-devel or #ubuntu-packaging. At a high level, if the next revision is such a big break then it should really be the start of a new release like 3.0 but that won't prevent an upgrade. You could go the separate PPA route but that isn't for everyone and you might start to lose users. The right thing to do is fix the application so it's actually backwards compatible. It doesn't matter that you release each month, the user should be able to expect that an update won't ruin their installation.\n", "Q: 2 folders in Sys/Class/Backlight?

Is it possible to make the newly active icon pop up under the Dash button, so new active program icons are on top and not the bottom of the list?\n\nA: The launcher gives you keyboard shortcuts to switch between windows. These are dynamic and based on the launcher position. If Nautilus is the first item, for instance, then you can start an instance or switch to an existing instance by pressing super+1. To display all open Nautilus windows, you'd then press super+11. (one one) In order to open a new instance, even if you already have one, you'd press super+shift+1. \nOnce you get used to them, these are extremely efficient keyboard shortcuts. However, if you placed new applications at the top, then the keyboard shortcuts would also be random, which would remove all the benefits. Another thing is that you may fill your launcher with more entries than it can display, in which case the lowest entries will be compacted or run out of the screen so you have to scroll. You probably wouldn't want your most frequently used applications to become less available. \nAdding to the top would also create two different groups of entries; the locked ones (the most frequently used) and the others. If you then decided to lock an entry to the launcher, what should happen? Should it be moved to the bottom of the list? And if you unlock an entry, should it be moved to the top of the launcher, or to the bottom of the unlocked entries? \nFor these reasons – and I'm sure there are more – I think it's highly unlikely that your idea will be implemented in Unity. \n\nA: When you do not mind about starting applications with super key shortcuts or the length of your launcher, here is the answer to your question:\nThe unity://running-apps position in the list of com.canonical.Unity.Launcher gsettings schema does affect where running apps appear, which have no launcher icon.\nMore on that topic follow the link:\nApplication always show in the third position in Ubuntu 16.04\n", "Q: How do I change the default application window background?

Once you are booted in a live USB you can use the partition manager that is included to delete the NTFS partitions and resize the Ubuntu partition (probably EXT4).\n\nI DONT recommend the following as you could lose all your files but if you are unable to backup you files first then you could boot a live USB then shrink the NTFS partitions and grow the Ubuntu partition (this will take a long time).

I have HP Mini 2133 netbook, with 1200MHz processor and 2GB of RAM. I am currently using the normal Ubuntu. But, Flash videos (on YouTube, etc.) do not play smoothly. I tried all optimizations, but the videos still don't play smoothly.\nWill changing to Xubuntu help play videos faster? I have the doubt because I am not sure whether the smoothness of Flash videos depends on processor speed or RAM size. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Your choice of Desktop environment is unlikely to affect flash performance.\n\nA: Well...  with those specs, I wouldn't even hesitate to question xubuntu.  Even I, with a 2.3GHz Dual-core processor and 4GB RAM am considering xubuntu for its raw speed.  \nYou can always download the xfce desktop environment from the USC and test it on your current system.\n\nA: Flash is most likely being slow because of either your CPU or graphics card. It may not be necessary to move to xubuntu. If you  are not doing so already you could give Unity-2D a go which could free up more graphics power for video. You can select Unity-2D from the login screen.\nedit by Michal: I think it is not related to hardware as I have the same problems and when I install windows XP, then flash videos play smooth in all resolutions... So it is clear the flash module in linux or other parts of linux OS IS CRAP\n\nA: I recently switched from Xubuntu 11.10 to Ubuntu 11.10, and also encountered degraded flash performance.  Logging out and switching from Unity to Unity 2D corrected the issue.  \nRunning an AMD N930 (2GHz, quad core) with a low end laptop radeon chip.\n\nA: Switching to Xubuntu will not improve Flash performance. \nConsider using the FlashVideoReplacer addon:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashvideoreplacer/\nhttp://www.webgapps.org/add-ons/flashvideoreplacer\n... or a stand alone program called Minitube:\nhttp://flavio.tordini.org/minitube\nBoth play plash videos without actually using Adobe Flash player, and should perform better.\n\nA: For YouTube you could use the FlasVideoReplacer Add-on to play videos in a standalone player (Totem, VLC...) or force YouTube videos to WebM.\nFlash is pretty crappy and therefore I'm Flash free since 1,5 years.\n", "Q: Broadcom 4331 card sees wireless networks but can't make a connection I followed the steps to get the broadcom 4331 card working on ubuntu  11.10.

I had very slow internet connection with my Asus K52F, so I had to follow these recommendations:\nResolve slow connexion...\n\nA: Before you try all these complicated solutions that they are recommending, try this (it's easy because it involves the gui...no commands, easily undone). Also, just a note: I tried a lot of stuff from online solutions people put forth (terminal commands disabling ipv6, installing some driver, doing gedits of things I had no clue what I was doing), but this is the only thing that had an immediate & lasting effect. The others seemingly did nothing; however, it could be that all the other solutions plus the following were what caused this to work (or it could be just this is the solution by itself). I'm a linux newbie, so I don't know.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the symbol for your wireless connection (upper right)\n\n*click edit connections\n\n*Click on the wireless tab \n\n*Click on your current wireless connection \n\n*Click edit\n\n*Click on ipv4 settings method drop down box: select \"automatic (dhcp) addresses only\"  \n\n*In the dns servers field: type the ip address of your wireless router or default gateway. Mine was 192.168.0.1 for example.\n\n*(optional) If you can some how do a benchmark of dns servers, finding the fastest one for you, that would be good. In my results the two fastest were my modem's ip address & my wireless router's ip address. The wireless router seemed to work the best. I did the benchmark in a windows virtual box pc. I tried 4.2.2.6 or .5 but it just remained slow as molasses.\n\n\nHit save. Disable your wireless hardware for a few seconds (my method is function key f2), turn it back on and test your browser's speed.\nIf that doesn't work, click on the ipv6 settings and select method:ignore, hit save & do the same thing (disable wireless, re-enable)\nI figured out that there was nothing wrong with the wireless/internet itself because only browsers were slow at going to websites (chrome, firefox, etc) while running them from Ubuntu. But when I tried my virtual box machines, they were lightening fast on the internet. \n\nA: 1. First method :\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to disactivate IPv6, to do that, open terminal and enter\nthe following commands:\necho “#disable ipv6″ | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\necho “net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1″ | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\necho “net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1″ | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\necho “net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1″ | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\n\n*Then restart your system.\n\n\nIf you still have the issue, follow also instructions on step 2.\n2. Second method:\n\n\n*\n\n*A second solution for this issue can be by using the following :\n\n*Open terminal and enter the following command:\nsudo -s\n\n\n*then gksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf and at the end of the\nfile add this:\noptions ath9k nohwcrypt=1\n\n\n*Save an restart your OS.\n\n", "Q: How to get GNOME Shell Calendar to sync with Google Calendar with Thunderbird installed? On GNOME Shell, I want to use the Calendar and have it synced with my Google Calendar account, but I have Thunderbird on my computer.  I have seen a couple of posts making Thunderbird default through the means of the terminal, but those changes did not effect the calendar on the desktop panel.  I have used Evolution in the past, and i never really liked it, but will conform to it if necessary for the ease of having Google Calendar sync.\n\nA: This Evolution Mirror extension for Thunderbird just worked perfectly for me and was very simple.\n1) sudo apt-get install python-evolution python-gnome2\n2) Run Evolution and go through the set-up dialog once. You can use fake credentials, doesn't matter. (I'm not sure why this is necessary but a comment on the add-on site recommends it.) Close Evolution.\n3) Download the extension file from the website (I couldn't find it in Thunderbird's built-in add-on searcher for some reason).\n4) Go to Tools -> Add-ons. Click the drop down next to search box and choose \"Install Add-on From File\". Select the .xpi extension file you just downloaded.\n5) Restart Thunderbird. Your Thunderbird events should now be appearing in the gnome (shell) clock applet. If you already have Google calendar syncing with Thunderbird then at this point your Google calendar will be showing up in the gnome clock applet.\noptional steps\n6) Uninstall Evolution (but not python-evolution). Do not purge evolution.\n7) If you run gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.office.calendar exec thunderbird then Thunderbird will open when you click \"Open Calendar\" in the clock applet.\n\nA: Ok, as I understand, what you need is to show your Thunderbird events in the top panel calendar in Gnome-Shell. So, I presume, the second part, i.e. syncing your Thunderbird calendar to Google is solved for you somehow.\nFor this you may want to do the following (it is really easy and takes about 5 minutes to do the whole thing):\n1) Install evolution and python-evolution (we are going to remove the Evolution later on):\nsudo apt-get install evolution python-evolution\n\n2) Open Thunderbird, go to File>New>Calendar, in the open dialog:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select On the Network\n\n*Leave iCalendar option selected and enter a location for the calendar your are creating somewhere in your home dir (it is prefferable NOT to use any .something folders, so that you will not accidentally delete it when you, for example, reinstall your system, so keep it in a safe place)\n\n*\n\n*The path should look something like this: file:///home/Jordan/MyCalendar/jordan.ics\n\n\n*Then name it something like Jordan's Calendar, and choose the other options as you like\n\n\n3) Now open Evolution, go to File>New>Calendar (we are NOT going to create another calendar here, but rather just link the Thunderbird calendar we just created to Evolution so that it will be shown up in the Gnome-Shell panel):\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Type = On This Computer\n\n*Name it (it does not have to have the same name as in Thunderbird, but for your convinience you may want to give it the same name as in Thunderbird, i.e. Jordan's Calendar)\n\n*Choose color\n\n*Check Mark as default calendar\n\n*Check Customize options:\n\n*\n\n*Open the File name dialog and select the same calendar file you created in Thunderbird (i.e. in our example go to /home/Jordan/MyCalendar/jordan.ics)\n\n*(!) Choose Refresh = On file change\n\n\n*Now you can Apply, and your Jordan's Calendar in Evolution will be synced to Thunderbird's one.\n\n*You may also want to uncheck all OTHER calendars in Evolution, but leave the one you just created checked.\n\n\n4) Now we are going to check how it works (it should already work for you!). Keep your Evolution open and open Thunderbird as well. Create a today's event in the newly created calendar in Thunderbird... within couple seconds it should immediately appear in Evolution and in the top panel under Today. Now in Thunderbird move (drag'n'drop) it to tomorrow... In you Evolution the event should be immediately moved to tomorrow, and the top panel calendar in Gnome-Shell now shows it under Tomorrow. So, it should work by now.\n5) (Optional) You may want to remove Evolution from your system, but there are two things you should leave: Evolution settings and python-evolution. To remove Evolution and keep your settings intact you use\nsudo apt-get remove evolution && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nbut NOT apt-get purge evolution! As for python-evolution, it is used by gnome-shell anyway, so just do not remove it.\nNow, you may use Thunderbird with the newly created calendar which is automatically and immediately being sync to the top panel calendar.\nJust make sure that you have moved all your old calendar events to the new one (export/import), or have it synced to Google Calendar.\n\nA: You could try: https://github.com/vintitres/gnome-shell-google-calendar\nFew steps are enough:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup dependencies: \nsudo apt-get install python-gtk2 python-dbus python-gdata python-iso8601 python-gnomekeyring\n\n*Download it from: https://github.com/vintitres/gnome-shell-google-calendar/zipball/master\n\n*Extract it in any folder you like.\n\n*Run gnome-shell-google-calendar.py:\n/path/where/you/extracted/gnome-shell-google-calendar/gnome-shell-google-calendar.py\n\n*You should beforehand have a online account set up with Google (see: What are online accounts and how do they work?). You should get prompted with this text:\nA list of existing accounts is below.\nIf you do not see a list of accounts, then you first need to add one.\nFor more information, see http://library.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/accounts.html\n0. yourname@gmail.com\nPlease choose the Account:\n\n*Enter the number of your account and the program will start to syncronize.\n\n*If you don't want to run it manually everytime, you should add gnome-shell-google-calendar.py to startup applications (see this answer: How do I manage applications on startup in GNOME 3? , insert in the field \"command\" the path of gnome-shell-google-calendar.py ).\nDone!\n\nA: No special software is necessary anymore. Just go to Settings->Online Accounts and add your Google account. Your Google Calendar will sync and events will appear in the GNOME Shell calendar widget.\nAccording to a comment above, this has been available since 3.8. I did not initially see that comment, and started following the instructions in the top answer, then saw that the Calendar switch in the settings and realized that it was already working.\n\nA: Since Evolution Mirror is broken you can use EDS Calendar Integration.

How does one access all the .files? \nAny information would be enlightening.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I am not sure what you are asking exactly.\nHidden\nA files or directories are \"hidden\" if they start with a \".\".\nOn the command line you can view them with ls -A and from nautilus (your file browser) by showing hidden files Ctl + H or from the menu\n\nPath\nYour path is where the system looks to find commands.\necho $PATH\n\nYou can set a path , typically in ~/.bashrc\nPATH=$PATH:/additional/directory\n\n\nA: I think you're misunderstanding the concept. In Unix, by convention, filenames starting with . are considered hidden - i.e. some programs, such as ls or GUI file managers do not display those files. Those files often used to store program settings or other stuff which user normally don't want to see.\nThis is just a convention and there's nothing magical about those files. \nUnlike Windows, Unix does not rely on \"file extensions\", i.e. a 3-character suffixes after a dot at the end of a filename, to determine the type of the file (i.e. NOTEPAD.EXE etc). \nSo, in Unix \"program.attribute\" is just a normal filename, not like a program named \"program\" has some magical attributes which you can access by specifying \"program.attributename\"\n", "Q: Opening a file opens the folder the file is in, not the file itself Whenever I try to open a file (such as an .odt, or .doc) from say, the Dash or the Firefox Downloads, Ubuntu 11.10 opens Nautilus to the the folder where the file is, rather than just going to the application and loading the file straight away.\nIn previous releases, when I clicked on a downloaded file, it just went straight to LibreOffice, and it was fine. This is adding a superfluous step in the process.\nHow do I associate the correct extensions?\n\nA: There is an easier way to fix this, even with exo installed (I use unity AND xfce4-panel so I needed both).\nOpen ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list in an editor (make a backup just in case!). Remove the following lines:\nx-scheme-handler/file=exo-file-manager.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/trash=exo-file-manager.desktop\n\nSave, and it should work now.\nSome users will need to make exactly the same changes to /usr/share/xubuntu/applications/defaults.list as well. The lines can be commented out by adding # at the beginning of each. The fix works after logging in again.\n\nA: uninstall exo\n...HOWEVER I believe this breaks xfce, so this will not work if you're using xfce as well as gnome. if you don't need xfce this works. in my case the following packages plus their dependencies:\nCompletely removed the following packages:\nexo-utils\nlibexo-1-0\nlibexo-common\nlibexo-helpers\n\nvery annoying problem and I had a very hard time finding the answer. finally found this : https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=882193 - if you're looking for a better solution that has more explanation.\nI believe this happened when I installed xfce to try it out.\n\nA: Similar question. Try this solution which is there in below URL.\nCan't open .xlsx file with LibreOffice\n\nA: I had the same problem, yet libexo was never installed. The rather brutal way of deleting the .local folder in my home directory solved it.\n", "Q: Can you use backup of one machine on a different machine? I don't have fancy directory seperation. I have a desktop and laptop, and for the last few months I did a lot of work on my laptop. I don't want to waste my time installing and configuring on my desktop.\nCan I use the laptop's backup on the Desktop?\nI know the potential concerns are drivers. How can I deal with such issue?\n(Both are Ubuntu 11.04)\nThanks.\n\nA: If you did not install any drivers outside of the Ubuntu repositories (nvidia, ati, wireless) you should be just fine.\nIf you did you would need to re-install them.\nAnother possibility would be to generate a list of installed packages and us it for a fresh install\n[old install]\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > packages.list\n\nNow put them back on the new installation\nsudo dpkg --set-selections <packages\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nThen copy your data or other files in $HOME, perhaps on a flash drive.\n", "Q: What are dot-files? I am having a hard time grasping what dot-files are or what they are for. Are they directories? How do I navigate to them?\nThank you!\n\nA: In Unix/Linux dot-files refers to files/directories with a . prepended to their name. Examples are ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, etc. The leading dot . is used as an indicator by software like bash and nautilus to not list these files normally but only when they are specifically requested like pressing Ctrl+H in Nautilus. This is because, generally, dot-files are used to store configurations for different applications but they are sometimes used otherwise as well. For example Mozilla creates a .mozilla folder which contains their configuration files as well as browser cache. \nPeople tend to backup & also share their dot-files so others can boot-strap their own applications using those configuration files. An example of a site dedicated to sharing dot-files is http://dotfiles.org.\n\nA: If you mean when there's a . in front of a file name... The file is hidden. It won't show up unless you make your computer show hidden files and folders.\nTry making a new folder, and renaming it to something that starts with a . and then watch it disappear.\n\nA: Dot files are hidden, as Daniel and Sai said before. If you list files in the directory, they normally don't show up.\nIn a GUI, mostly file-open/file-save dialogs, you hit the right mouse button, and get a context-menu, allowing you to show hidden files.\nHere is, how to handle them in the shell:\nexample:\n$ > touch a b c .d .e f.f g. \n\n(generated testdata)\n$ > wc -l *\n0 a\n0 b\n0 c\n0 f.f\n0 g.\n0 total\n\nAs you can see, the first command does not reveal .d and .e\n$ > wc -l .*\nwc: .: Is a directory\n      0 .\nwc: ..: Is a directory\n      0 ..\n      0 .d\n      0 .e\n      0 total\n\nwc -l .* shows them, and the 2 special files, . which is the PWD, the present working dir, and .. which is the parent of the pwd.\n$ > wc -l .* *\nwc: .: Is a directory\n      0 .\nwc: ..: Is a directory\n      0 ..\n      0 .d\n      0 .e\n      0 a\n      0 b\n      0 c\n      0 f.f\n      0 g.\n      0 total\n\nwc -l * .* works on normal and hidden files (which again repeats PWD and the upper directory, but for other commands, * .* might fit better, for example\n find -type f \\( -name \"*\" -or -name \".*\" \\) -execdir wc -l {} \";\"\n\nWhich will not show the directories . and ...\nIf you use firefox for file system browsing, file://home/joe you have an option box to show/hide those files.\n\nA: To clear up some possible confusion... there is nothing special about files or folders beginning with a dot, but by convention, they are simply not displayed unless you specifically request them to be.  They are, by convention, for configuration files or directories in your home folder, with the dot prepended (not appended) to keep the directory listings cleaner.\nThe conventional way to see them is by adding an a, for all, to the ls command if you are using a terminal.  This can be combined with other switches (letters following a hyphen):\nls -a\n\nIn a graphic file manager, you will need to choose either \"show hidden\" or use the hotkey (in Nautilus, it is Ctrl-H) to see these files.\nNote that you can still enter the name if you know it's there - it is a valid filename, and is no different than any other file or directory.  It is opened and saved just like any other.\n\nA: The how do I navigate to them wasn't answered from a GUI perspective. In nautilus do a Ctrl-H and you'll toggle visibility for \".\" files and folders in that nautilus window. There's also a selection for visibility in the View text menu.\n", "Q: Importing Contacts from dotProject I have a bazoodle of contacts in a dotProject csv file.  I'd really like to import these into U1 (maybe via Evolution).\nI can tell which fields are what (e.g., what's last name, etc.) in the dotProject file, but I don't know how to tell, e.g., Evolution what's what so I can import them.\nHas anyone done this, or know how?  I've looked around to no avail!\nThanks\n\nA: For the .csv file layout that Evolution expects, there's an entry in the German ubuntuusers Wiki (subsection \"Beliebige Adressdaten importieren\"; first line in the code display):\n\"First Name\",\"Last Name\",\"id\",\"NickName\",\"E-mail Address\",\"E-mail 2 Address\",\"E-mail 3 Address\",\"E-mail 4 Address\",\"Wants HTML\",\"Business Phone\",\"Home Phone\",\"Business Fax\",\"Pager\",\"Mobile Phone\",\"Home Street\",\"Home Street 2\",\"Home City\",\"Home State\",\"Home Postal Code\",\"Home Country\",\"Business Street\",\"Business Street 2\",\"Business City\",\"Business State\",\"Business Postal Code\",\"Business Country\",\"Job Title\",\"Office\",\"Company\",\"Web Page\",\"Cal uri\",\"Birth Year\",\"Birth Month\",\"Birth Day\",\"Notes\"\n\nYou could try to re-arrange your .csv file in that order -- e.g. using (OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice) Calc -- , and add that as first line on top of your .csv.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu 11.10 64bit using all my memory?

I am trying to change the default orange cone icon for the VLC media player on the Unity bar in 11.10. I have tried following similar posts in this forum, but without any luck. I changed the vlc.png icon I found in the /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps directory (which i assume is the icon used on the unity bar) by copying a different .png file to it with the same name. It is also a 256x256 pixel .png file. I restarted Ubuntu and the orange cone is still there. I've read tidbits online about having to recompile the program or something, so I don't know if this is more complicated a process than I assumed.

Is it possible the icon is some how hardcoded into the program? I've also now succesfully changed firefox's icon as well...so I don't think I'm doing something wrong\n\nA: If it isn't an issue with the theme you're using, then have you tried updating the icon cache with sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor ? (replace \"hicolor\" by whichever theme you're using. You'll need to put the icon in the appropriate theme folder as well)\nAs a bit of extra information. In /usr/share/applications you'll find a vlc.desktop file. You could change the following line:\nIcon=vlc\n\nWith another Icon of your choice (I prefere to set a svg file in the \"scalable\" directory rather than a rasterized x by y png ). After that you have to do the update command I gave earlier.\nIf you encounter any issues with the update command try appending the -f -t options. \n\nA: You can't change it for now as long as VLC team has not gotten rid of the systray icon hardcoding.\nActually it is reported as bug : \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vlc/+bug/530797\nPleace mark the bug as affecting you if so.\n", "Q: Getting grub error 19 after booting I installed ubuntu 11.10, installation completed successfully.\nWhen I remove boot device and restart PC, on loading grub gives \"Error 19.\"\n\nA: Try to insert the Ubuntu live device and restore GRUB.\n", "Q: Is there a hdaps extension of gnome shell? hdaps is a hard disk protect implement in thinkpad T and W series.\nMy computer is thinkpad W500.\nHow to use hdaps in gnome shell ?\nThanks \n\nA: hdaps isn't anything to do with the user interface.

I'm not having luck with any of the \"simple\" solutions that I'm finding. \nThe gist is I've got Ubuntu Server 11.10 running on a small laptop (32 bit Intel architecture). I'm trying to read a unicode file that is 343868522737 bytes in size (0x50102940f1). The Ubuntu machine keeps thinking it is much smaller (0x102940f1) which turns out to be only the lower 32 bits of a true 64bit sized file.\nI wrote a small program that I've compiled on a MacOS and on the Ubuntu box. The Mac seems to behave correctly, the Ubuntu box does not. \nThe small program is below. While I've commented out a block of code, that is really only necessary for the Mac.

At this point I'm simply stumped.\n\nA: According to this, the size of long unsigned int on 32-bit Unix is 4 bytes - can it be that the value is trimmed where you're casting fmaxlen to (long unsigned int)?\n\nA: You can find documentation for the macros controlling this behaviour with man feature_test_macros.\nFrom that documentation, you should only need to set _FILE_OFFSET_BITS to 64.  That should redefine off_t and functions like fseeko, ftello to 64-bit safe versions (this is a no-op on 64-bit systems, and redirects the symbols to the 64 suffixed versions on 32-bit systems).  This is preferable to using the 64 suffixed functions directly.\nAnd as Sergey said, casting the off_t value down to a long unsigned int will lose information on 32-bit systems.  I don't think there is a standard printf format code for off_t, so you are probably best off casting the value to unsigned long long int and using the %#llx as the format code.  That should be warning free on both word sizes and not lose information.\n", "Q: How do I recover my applets / settings in the GNOME fallback session after a 11.10 upgrade?

For now, I am doing it manually by moving the entire window but one corner out of the screen and then pulling the corner to expand the window. However, this is very time taking. Is there some way to resize the window to a particular height and width instantly ? (perhaps from commandline or with the help of some small app or something else)\n\nA: I propose two solutions\nwmctrl\nInstall the wmctrl package, then you can resize your window with\nwmctrl -r string -e 0,left,up,width,height\n\nwhere string is a substring of the window's title, (left,up) are the desired screen coordinates of the upper left window's corner, and (width,height) are the desired window's dimensions.\nFor a more precise window's choice, run wmctrl -l, which will give you a list of records containing window's ID, screen's number and window's title. Then you can resize a particular window by ID with\nwmctrl -i -r ID -e 0,left,up,width,height\n\nMore information in wmctrl man page.\ndevilspie\nInstall the package devilspie, then create the folder ~/.devilspie and a file my-name.ds in this folder, with content:\n(if (is (window_name) \"My Window\") (geometry \"widthxheight+left+up\"))\n\nthen execute devilspie to resize your window.\n", "Q: How can I disable passwordless login?

Possible questions follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the benefits of an Ubuntu installed just in one single primary partition, that is /dev/sda3?\n\n*Why the related filesystem is ext3, though Maverick is shipped with a kernel recent enough to handle ext4?\n\n*What's the purpose of the first primary partition, that is /dev/sda1? I noticed it's FAT and when the system is up it is not mounted...\n\n*How is the bootstrap supposed to work? While upgrading packages a dialog box appeared concerning possible destinations for grub, but, though I was pretty sure MBR was a suitable place, I ended up choosing both sda and sda3: if I'm not wrong I was not allowed to go on unless I checked them both... Anyway I was not happy to proceed without understanding what I was actually changing, I didn't know what there was initially in the MBR and what there was in the partition boot sector of sda3...\n\n*What can I do in order to perform kind of a \"blind\" system recovery? I mean, I can install Ubuntu from scratch, but what if I wanted to reproduce the exact initial conditions at the very first boot of the machine? I thought a dump of sda or separate dumps of sda1 and sda3 would be very useful, unfortunately I didn't launch my \"dd\" timely to get those dumps on my own. Would you ever make that kind of dumps available?\n\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\nA: I'll try to answer each point, but there's a few details I need filled in.\n\n\n*\n\n*The benefit of having the entire OS and your personal data on one partition is that there is only one partition to manage. If you want to shrink/expand/move the partition then there are fewer other partitions getting in the way. I, personally, prefer to have many partitions. It is not as likely on personal machines as on servers, but errant programs can cause a partition to overfill.\n\n*Ext4 has some performance issues that are holding it back from being the default root filesystem. See the last heading of this article. It is very possible to use it as a root fs however and the article has details on how to do an inplace upgrade (do not do if you're still using [legacy] GRUB)\n\n*I don't know what the size of the partition is, but I can guess by the filesystem, the placement, and the fact that it isn't mounted that it either has to do with booting or with factory backups. Did you install Ubuntu yourself? If not, I'd say that is the factory backup. If yes, then it is likely the boot partition (which could also be mounted as /boot)\n\n*Again, depends on if you installed Ubuntu or if a factory did. If a factory did, then they likely included a recovery partition. Else, you're stuck using Ubuntu live disks/USBs to reinstall.\n\nA: The person above me has covered already a couple of questions. I'll go a little into detail on the /sda1 FAT partition that is present on the EEE pc 1011px (I have the same one, still quite happy with it running xubuntu 12.04). \nYou can mount that partition by\nsudo mkdir /media/newhd\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/newhd\ndf -H\n\nYou can view the files by browsing to them via nautilus or by typing in the terminal:\ncd /media/newhd\nls -l\n\nIn it you'll find a couple of folders\n.disk boot casper..\nAll those folder toghether (EXCEPT the BOOT folder) are an extracted iso of the ubuntu version that was pre-installed on your netbook. I'd guess if you copy those files on a FAT32 formatted USB thumb drive you could use that to do a blind system recovery  There must be a way to access it directly without usb thumb drive but it is not mentioned in the manual. \nHope this is a bit clarifying\n", "Q: Is there a way to use colors to differentiate nautilus windows?

And a empty partition 100g. How can I expand the partition with ubuntu? I boot from liveCD, start gparted, sgrink 1 partition, and could't expand the 2 partition. \n\nA: You boot a live Cd as you have, you then have to manage the changes in steps.\nResize (shrink) partition 1 -> apply changes Resize (expand) partition 2.\nThe only potential complication you might have is if the Ubuntu partition is in an Extended partition . In that event there may be more steps.\nAssuming you have Windows on a primary partition, sda1, and Ubuntu on a logical partition , sda5, in an extended partition, sda2 ..\nshrink sda1 -> apply changes -> expand sda2 -> apply changes -> expand sda5 -> apply changes.\n\nA: In order to expand a partition, there must be free space following it.  If it is a logical partition ( numbered 5 and up ), then it must be entirely contained within the extended partition, so you have to expand that first.\n\nA: You can only expand a partition into unallocated space; you cannot expand into an empty partition.  You must delete whatever partition - extended or logical - that is adjacent to the partition you want to expand.\nBoot from a LiveCD, such as the Ubuntu 11.10 CD.  When you get the chance, choose \"Try Ubuntu\" (you don't want to install it).  When it gives you the desktop, open GParted, and you will see the layout of your drives.  You said you have two partitions, so one of them will contain your current installation of Ubuntu; the other will be the \"empty\" 100GB partition.\nIn order to expand the Ubuntu partition into the \"empty\" partition, you must first delete the \"empty\" partition.  Right-click in that partition - making very sure you don't choose the Ubuntu partition! - and choose \"Delete\" from the pop-up menu.  Go ahead and hit \"Apply.\"  Once the operation has completed, the partition will become grey and will be labelled \"Unallocated.\"\nNow you can expand the Ubuntu partition.  Right-click on the Ubuntu partition, choose \"Resize,\" and make it as large as you'd like.  When you have it as you want it, close that menu then choose \"Apply.\" The operation will begin and it will probably take a minute or two - or more, depending on what it has to do.\n", "Q: Artifacts in Unity I'm using Ubuntu 11.10.

Use this if you are not running servers on the guests.\nBridged - Your guests will get a ip address on the same subnet as your host. Use this if you are running servers on the guest and wish to connect from other computers on the LAN.\nHost Only - Sort of a hybrid.

What is the best way to install Python packages in Ubuntu 11? I am a recent convert to Ubuntu and want to learn best practices.\nFor context, I am looking to install the tweeststream package, but I did not see it in my Synaptic package manager. Also, I am very new to programming, but I usually can follow along with code samples.\n\nA: updated: 2019-05-11: This post mostly mentions virtualenv, but according to the Python doc about module installation, since Python 3.5 \"the use of venv is now recommended for creating virtual environments\", while virtualenv is an alternative for versions of Python prior to 3.4.\nupdated: 2018-08-17: since conda-4.4.0 use conda to activate anaconda on all platforms\nupdated: 2017-03-27: PEP 513 - manylinux binaries for PyPI\nupdated: 2016-08-19: Continuum Anaconda Option\nThis is somewhat a duplicate of easy_install/pip or apt-get.\nFor global Python packages, use either the Ubuntu Software Center, apt, apt-get or synaptic\nUbuntu uses Python for many important functions, therefore interfering with Python can corrupt your OS. This is the main reason I never use pip on my Ubuntu system, but instead I use either Ubuntu Software Center, synaptic, apt-get, or the newer just apt, which all by default install packages from the Ubuntu repository. These packages are tested, usually pre-compiled so they install faster and ultimately designed for Ubuntu. In addition all required dependencies are also installed and a log of installs is maintained so they can be rolled back. I think most packages have corresponding Launchpad repos so you can file issues.\nAnother reason to use either Ubuntu packages is that sometimes these Python packages have different names depending on where you downloaded them from. Python-chardet is an example of a package which at one time was named one thing on PyPI and another thing in the Ubuntu repository. Therefore doing something like pip install requests will not realize that chardet is already installed in your system because the Ubuntu version has a different name, and consequently install a new version which will corrupt your system in a minor insignificant way but still why would you do that.\nIn general you only want to install trusted code into your OS. So you should be nervous about typing $ sudo pip <anything-could-be-very-bad>.\nLastly some things are just easier to install using either Ubuntu packages. For example if you try pip install numpy to install numpy & scipy unless you have already installed gfortran, atlas-dev, blas-dev and lapack-dev, you will see an endless stream of compile errors. However, installing numpy & scipy through the Ubuntu repository is as easy as...\n$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy\n\nYou are in luck, because you are using Ubuntu, one of the most widely supported and oft updated distributions existing. Most likely every Python package you will need is in the Ubuntu repository, and probably already installed on your machine. And every 6 months, a new cycle of packages will be released with the latest distribution of Ubuntu.\nIf you are 100% confident that the package will not interfere with your Ubuntu system in any way, then you can install it using pip and Ubuntu is nice enough to keep these packages separate from the distro packages by placing the distro packages in a folder called dist-packages/. Ubuntu repository has both pip, virtualenv and setuptools. However, I second Wojciech's suggestion to use virtualenv.\nFor personal Python projects use pip and wheel in a virtualenv\nIf you need the latest version, or the module is not in the Ubuntu repository then start a virtualenv and use pip to install the package. Although pip and setuptools have merged, IMO pip is preferred over easy-install or distutils, because it will always wait until the package is completely downloaded and built before it copies it into your file system, and it makes upgrading or uninstalling a breeze. In a lot of ways it is similar to apt-get, in that it generally handles dependencies well. However you will may have to handle some dependencies yourself, but since PEP 513 was adopted there are now manylinux binaries at the Python Package Index (PyPI) for popular Linux distros like Ubuntu and Fedora. for example as mentioned above for NumPy and SciPy make sure you have installed gfortran, atlas-dev, blas-dev and lapack-dev from the Ubuntu repository For example, both NumPy and SciPy are now distributed for Ubuntu as manylinux wheels by default using OpenBLAS instead of ATLAS. You can still build them from source by using the pip options --no-use-wheel or --no-binary <format control>.\n~$ sudo apt-get install gfortran libblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-dev python-virtualenv\n~$ mkdir ~/.venvs\n~$ virtualenv ~/.venvs/my_py_proj\n~$ source ~/.venvs/my_py_proj/bin/activate\n~(my_py_proj)$ pip install --no-use-wheel numpy scipy\n\nSee the next section, \"You're not in sudoers\", below for installing updated versions of pip, setuptools, virtualenv or wheels to your personal profile using the --user installation scheme with pip. You can use this to update pip for your personal use as J.F. Sebastian indicated in his comment to another answer. NOTE: the -m is really only necessary on MS Windows when updating pip.\npython -m pip install --user pip setuptools wheel virtualenv\n\nNewer versions of pip automatically cache wheels, so the following is only useful for older versions of pip. Since you may end up installing these many times, consider using wheel with pip to create a wheelhouse. Wheel is already included in virtualenv since v13.0.0 therefore if your version of virtualenv is too old, you may need to install wheel first.\n~(my_py_proj)$ pip install wheel  # only for virtualenv < v13.0.0\n~(my_py_proj)$ pip wheel --no-use-wheel numpy scipy\n\nThis will create binary wheel files in <cwd>/wheelhouse, use -d to specify a different directory. Now if you start another virtualenv and you need the same packages you've already built, you can install them form your wheelhouse using pip install --find-links=<fullpath>/wheelhouse\nRead Installing Python Modules in the Python documentation and Installing packages on the Python Package Index main page. Also pip, venv, virtualenv and wheel.\nIf you're not in sudoers and virtualenv isn't installed.\nAnother option to using a virtual environment, or if you are using a Linux share without root privileges, then using either the --user or --home=<wherever-you-want> Python installation schemes with Python's distutils will install packages to the value of site.USERBASE or to wherever you want. Newer versions of pip also have a --user option. Do not use sudo!\npip install --user virtualenv\n\nIf your Linux version of pip is too old, then you can pass setup options using --install-option which is useful for passing custom options to some setup.py scripts for some packages that build extensions, such as setting the PREFIX. You may need to just extract the distribution and use distutils to install the package the old-school way by typing python setup install [options]. Reading some of the install documentation and the distutils documentation may help.\nPython is nice enough to add site.USERBASE to your PYTHONPATH ahead of anything else, so the changes will only effect you. A popular location for --home is ~/.local. See the Python module installation guide for the exact file structure and specifically where your site-packages are. Note: if you use the --home installation scheme then you may need to add it to the PYTHONPATH environment variable using export in your .bashrc, .bash_profile or in your shell for your localized packages to be available in Python.\nUse Continuum Anaconda Python for Math, Science, Data, or Personal Projects\nIf you are using Python for either math, science, or data, then IMO a really good option is the Anaconda-Python Distribution or the more basic miniconda distro released by Anaconda, Inc. (previously known as Continuum Analytics). Although anyone could benefit from using Anaconda for personal projects, the default installation includes over 500 math and science packages like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, while miniconda only installs Anaconda-Python and the conda environment manager. Anaconda only installs into your personal profile, ie: /home/<user>/ and alters your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile to prepend Anaconda's path to your personal $PATH recommends sourcing conda.sh in your ~/.bashrc which lets you use conda activate <env|default is base> to start anaconda - this only affects you - your system path is unchanged. Therefore you do not need root access or sudo to use Anaconda! If you have already added Anaconda-Python, miniconda, or conda to your personal path, then you should remove the PATH export from your ~/.bashrc, and update to the new recommendation, so your system Python will be first again.\nThis is somewhat similar to the --user option I explained in the last section except it applies to Python as a whole and not just packages. Therefore Anaconda is completely separate from your system Python, it won't interfere with your system Python, and only you can use or change it. Since it installs a new version of Python and all of its libraries you will need at least 200MB of room, but it is very clever about caching and managing libraries which is important for some of the cool things you can do with Anaconda.\nAnaconda curates a collection of Python binaries and libraries required by dependencies in an online repository (formerly called binstar), and they also host user packages as different \"channels\". The package manager used by Anaconda, conda, by default installs packages from Anaconda, but you can signal a different \"channel\" using the -c option.\nInstall packages with conda just like pip:\n$ conda install -c pvlib pvlib  # install pvlib pkg from pvlib channel\n\nBut conda can do so much more! It can also create and manage virtual environments just like virtualenv. Therefore since Anaconda creates virtual environments, the pip package manager can be used to install packages from PyPI into an Anaconda environment without root or sudo. Do not use sudo with Anaconda! Warning! Do be careful though when mixing pip and conda in an Anaconda environment, b/c you will have to manage package dependencies more carefully. Another option to pip in a conda environment is to use the conda-forge channel, but also best to do that in a fresh conda environment with conda-forge as the default channel. As a last resort, if you can't find a package anywhere but on PyPI, consider using --no-deps then install the remaining dependencies manually using conda.\nAnaconda is also similar in some ways to Ruby RVM if you're familiar with that tool. Anaconda conda also lets you create virtual environments with different versions of Python. e.g.: conda create -n py35sci python==3.5.2 numpy scipy matplotlib pandas statsmodels seaborn will create a scientific/data-science stack using Python-3.5 in a new environment called py35sci. You can switch environments using conda. Since conda-4.4.0, this is now different to virtualenv which uses source venv/bin/activate, but previous to conda-4.4.0 the conda commands were the same as virtualenv and also used source:\n# AFTER conda-4.4 \n~/Projects/myproj $ conda activate py35sci\n\n# BEFORE conda-4.4 \n~/Projects/myproj $ source activate py35sci\n\nBut wait there's more! Anaconda can also install different languages such as R for statistical programming from the Anaconda r channel. You can even set up your own channel to upload package distributions built for conda. As mentioned conda-forge maintains automated builds of many of the packages on PyPI at the conda-forge Anaconda channel.\nEpilogue\nThere are many options for maintaining your Python projects on Linux depending on your personal needs and access. However, if there's any one thing I hope you take away from this answer is that you should never use sudo pip to install Python packages. The use of sudo should be a warning to you to be extra cautious because you will make system wide changes that could have bad consequences. You have been warned.\nGood luck and happy coding!\n\nA: In addition to Zetah'a answer, command to install python-pip from terminal is:\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n\n\nA: I think best way for you would be to install Python packaging system like \"python-pip\". You can install it with Synaptic or Ubuntu Software Center.  \nPip will allow you to easy install and uninstall Python packages, simply as pip install package. \nIn your case it would be something like this from terminal:\nsudo pip install tweeststream\n\n\nA: In addition to Novarchibald's addition, it is generally a good idea to create a virtual environment for your python project and install dependencies inside. This allows you to have better control over dependencies and their versions. To set up a virtual environment, enter:\nvirtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute my_python_project\n\nThen, activate it with:\ncd my_python_project\nsource bin/activate\n\nAt this point anything that you install with pip will be kept inside this virtual environment. If you want to install something globally, then you should first exit virtualenv with:\ndeactivate\n\nYou can find out more about virtualenv here.\n\nA: Try this\nA GUI framework for PIP developed using PyQt4\nA GUI framework for PIP developed using PyQt4\nThe Start Screen\n\nThe start screen contains options for a user to select the process he wants to be carried out.\nOne can also specify the version of python he wants the operations to be performed upon.\nThe file menu has an option to \"Exit\" (shortcut: Ctrl+Q) and \"Refresh Lists\" which refreshes the resources files containing package data.\nThe Installation Screen\n\nThe installation screen has a search bar which the user can use to search and install desired package(s).\nThe Update Screen\n\nThe update screen displays the list of packages which are out-of-date and can be upgraded.\nThe Uninstall Screem\n\nThe uninstall screen displays the list of packages which are installed in the user's system and can be uninstalled.\nThe Progress Window\n\nThe progress window is an built-in terminal widget for PIP-GUI which displays the processes running while performing operations.\n", "Q: How do I use Mutter with GNOME Shell? I'm new to the whole GNOME Shell. I recently installed it, and I read somewhere a while ago that Compiz is completely broken with GNOME Shell so I have to use Mutter instead. I have no idea where to start though; I sifted through Google and couldn't find any tutorials on it. So far, I have brought up a terminal and did sudo mutter --replace; this works okay, but I don't know how to replace it permanently so I always have Mutter enabled. Secondly it seems to kill the whole shell: I can't move my cursor to the top left and access my applications like I could before.\nIs there an easier way? Also, how do I access the effects like in Compiz?\nI'm sorry, I'm pretty new.\n\nA: Mutter is the default window manager in gnome-shell. You don't have to start it manually, let alone with super user privileges. All you have to do is install gnome-shell and use it as session instead of Unity.\n\nA: GNOME Shell comes with Mutter as it depends on it; no further manual configuration is required from the user to get both running.\nAs for the Compiz-like effects (which, for future reference, should be posted as a separate question), there aren't any, at least not built-in. Compiz supplies window and desktop effects using plugins, but with GNOME Shell as of right now you're stuck with what it comes with. However, some early efforts are starting to write GNOME Shell extensions which enable desktop effects through Clutter (which is what Mutter is based upon); you can see an example here: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/gnome-shell-focus-effects-extension.html\n", "Q: InspIRCd with gnutls I'm receiving an error trying to setup an IRC server with InspIRCd using gnutls for SSL connections.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Server 11.10 (Kernel 3.0.0-14-server)\n\n*InspIRCd-1.1.22+Azeitao r0\n\n\nLogfile;\n==> /var/log/inspircd.log <==\nFri Jan 13 12:03:44 2012: Done reading configuration file.\nFri Jan 13 12:03:44 2012: Unable to load /usr/lib/inspircd/modules/m_ssl_gnutls.so: /usr/lib/inspircd/modules/m_ssl_gnutls.so: undefined symbol: gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn\nFri Jan 13 12:03:44 2012: There was an error loading the module 'm_ssl_gnutls.so': Loader/Linker error: /usr/lib/inspircd/modules/m_ssl_gnutls.so: undefined symbol: gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn\n\nThe gnutls packages that are currently on the system;\ndpkg --get-selections | grep gnutls\ngnutls-bin                                      install\nlibcurl3-gnutls                                 install\nlibgnutls-dev                                   install\nlibgnutls26                                     install\nlibgnutlsxx26                                   install\nlibneon27-gnutls                                install\n\ninspircd.conf excerpt\n<module name=\"m_ssl_gnutls.so\"> \n<bind address=\"192.168.1.2\" port=\"6697\" type=\"clients\" ssl=\"gnutls\">                                                                      \n<ssl_cert name=\"cert1\" certfile=\"/etc/ssl/certs/server.cer\" keyfile=\"/etc/ssl/private/server.key\">                                         \n\n\nA: Works for me. \nPerhaps your syntax is wrong?\n<bind address=\"10.0.0.10\" port=\"6667\" type=\"clients\" ssl=\"gnutls\">\n\n<module name=\"m_ssl_gnutls.so\"> \n\n<gnutls cafile=\"\" crlfile=\"\" certfile=\"/etc/inspircd/ssl.cert\" keyfile=\"/etc/inspircd/ssl.key\" dh_bits=\"2048\">\n\nAlso, make sure you stripped your passphrase that wraps your ssl key file (so it can boot)\nSee:\nArchive:  http://85.13.254.50/index.php\n\nNew Incomplete Docs:  https://github.com/inspircd/wiki/wiki/_pages\n\n\nA: The apt packages for InspIRCd are heavily out of date and are full of bugs like the one you have encountered.

You can search it in the Software Center as mentioned above or also do it from the Ubuntu Apps webpage. Make sure you select Ubuntu (maverick) from the right-hand side under \"Available Options\"\n\nAlternatively, you could also install the desktop environment from your terminal (*Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal *) using this command - sudo apt-get install edubuntu-desktop The edubuntu-desktop is a metapackage, meaning it holds links to the other packages that need to be installed to get the Edubuntu desktop environment. In short you could think of it like pointers or shortcut icons on your desktop. So when you say install the edubuntu-desktop metapackage, it'll install all the programs and stuff that constitute the edubuntu desktop environment.\nOnce that is installed, in any of the two above methods, the desktop environment should be selectable from the login page. \n", "Q: Google Chrome unity icon does not restore after minimizing After minimizing the Google Chrome window, clicking on the chrome icon in the unity sidebar doesn't restore the window.

I found the answer which post the link below.\nI am running Ubuntu on my CR48 how do I install a new kernel?\nOr If you have another answer, please post it and discuss together. Thanks!\n\nA: I found the .deb files in ubuntu mainline. Downloaded and installed 3.2.4 without problems. However I cannot remove the old kernel. It just doesn't want to be removed.\nBTW as far as usr/scr I found that in checking the files there. My new kernel placed files there. \n\nA: For being able to build the out-of-tree modules, you need the linux-headers-$(uname -r) package. Seeing the + on the end, I believe that your 2.6.38.3+ kernel is compiled yourself.\nI recommend to build a .deb package which could then be installed with dpkg (and uninstalled as well):\nmake oldconfig\nmake INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 deb-pkg -j30\n\nChange 30 to a number between CPU cores + 1 (if you're CPU bound) and twice CPU cores (if you're I/O bound). INSTALL_MOD_STRIP yields smaller packages as it removes debugging information from the modules. This process will create four .deb files, namely linux-firmware-image, linux-headers, linux-image and linux-libc-dev. The most important here are the linux-image-VERSION and linux-headers-VERSION packages; the first contains the kernel image and modules, the second one headers which are needed to compile out-of-tree modules.\n\nA: You can install any kernel you want and use any of them while booting. There is no problem on using one or multiple Kernels at a time. But sometime you should consider the Kernel Mapping to your Ubuntu Version. For example following link lists out the mapping of different kernel to different version of OS. Search for your Ubuntu Version and look on the table which lists the maximum version of kernel you can install and use without any problem:\nUbuntu to Mainline kernel version mapping\nYou can get a complete information of Kernel installing/removing from following link. \nKernel Mainline Builds\nIt helped me a lot to install a new kernel in Ubuntu 12.04.2.

Any solution to this?\nThank's for your time\n\nA: I found a solution on the Ubuntu forums (it's a link from the link Michael Barlach provided).\n\n\n*\n\n*First run this in a terminal:\nsudo chattr +i ~/.config/xfce4/desktop/icons*\n\n\n*This will lock your icon placement, so that when the desktop is resized, your icons technically remain in the same place.  \n\n*When your desktop gets resized, press F5 to reload it.\n\n*Optionally, you can create a launcher on the panel with this command: xfdesktop --reload which will reload the desktop.\n\n\n\nIf you need to reverse the lock on your icon placement run:\nsudo chattr -i ~/.config/xfce4/desktop/icons*\n\n\nA: An alternative approach without the need for repeated use of \"sudo chattr\" is described here: http://odoepner.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/backuprestore-xfce-desktop-icons/\n\nWhat that says is:\nCreate a file (e.g. save-xfce-desktop-icons.sh) with this content:\n#! /bin/sh\nmkdir -p ~/.config/xfce4/desktop.bak\ncp -f ~/.config/xfce4/desktop/icons* ~/.config/xfce4/desktop.bak\n\nand another one (e.g.  load-xfce-desktop-icons.sh):\n#! /bin/sh\ncp -f ~/.config/xfce4/desktop.bak/icons* ~/.config/xfce4/desktop\n\nMake the scripts executable and in the XFCE start menu, go to “Settings” – “Keyboard” – “Application Shortcuts” and configure 2 keyboard shortcuts for them.\n\nA: Here is something that worked for me.\nI noticed that the problem appeared when I created a panel along the upper side of the screen.\nWhen I changed this panel from 32 pixels to 40 pixels, it solved the issue. I noticed that the icons sometimes got slightly under the panel what gave me the idea of trying to change the size of the panel.\nHope this can help others and maybe help identify the origin of the bug.\n\nA: I had the same issue on my Xubuntu 14.04 (Italian GUI). Obviously the other solutions in this page work, but they're a workaround. \nSurprisingly I was able to solve it by logging out after having checked the checkbox (\"Save the session for next accesses\"), disabled automatic logon (i.e. the feature that allows to log on without typing the password) and the relogging on. After this, I disabled automatic logon, logged out and then logged in again, choosing this time not to use the saved session.\nFrom then, all my desktop icons remain in the places I need them to be at each reboot, relog, etc. \nDon't ask me why this happens, I'm happy enough to have solved my issue.\nAll the best\n", "Q: How do I disable the default window restore animation?

I'm using 11.10 (ext4) and somehow I've lost /home/myuserid.  /home is there, but appears empty.  I can boot to the login prompt and login as Guest, but when attempting to login as myuserid, I get routed back to the login screen.  I can also boot into recovery mode via Grub, then to a root prompt.  As both Guest and root, /home appears empty:\nroot@ubuntu:~$ cd /home\nroot@ubuntu:/home$ ls -al\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root    60 2012-01-13 07:42 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   240 2012-01-13 07:42 ..\nroot@ubuntu:/home$ \n\nHowever, when I boot the computer with my Ubuntu installation USB, run from USB, and open Nautilus, I can see /home/myuserid is there, and all the files in it are intact.  I tried recovering it using parted as explained on the Ubuntu Data Recovery page, but the rescue START END command didn't do anything (didn't even give a return code, just a new prompt).\nIt seems like I've just deleted a pointer in the partition table to the location on disk or something, without deleting the actual partition and files.  Anyone know how to restore /home/myuserid?\nPS - I've read through many of the threads here on this topic, but they all seem oriented toward restoring lost files, rather than restoring a partition table pointer to a user folder, or fixing a problem with a user folder not mounting correctly, or whatever it is I've done here.  My files really aren't lost, I can see and open them just fine when running from the USB drive, and I'm hesitant to try recovery tools like PhotoRec when 1) they don't seem 100% reliable, and 2) I suspect the solution is simpler.\nEdit: /home is not mounted now.  Booting with the USB drive, which is what I'm doing now, does not automount it.  And yes /home is on its own partition (as are /boot, swap, /, and /home, all on separate partitions).\n\nA: We do not know why or how you lost your $HOME but from what you said it still seems there. \nYou can easily switch to a shell from your Guest Session by pressing Alt+Ctrl+F1. From there login with your myuserid. You may experience an error saying No directory: logging in with HOME=/. After being logged in run\ncd /home/myuserid\nls\n\nIf all files are in place and only then you may be able to restore your HOME with the following command\nsudo usermod -d /home/myuserid myuserid\n\nLog out from the guest session and login to your account as usual.\nIf your files are not visible from the guest session then do as comments already suggested.

It's a problem with your computer's BIOS not using the wireless keyboard and mouse as it should. When this happens, your options become very limited. The most practical one is to simply buy a wired keyboard. You can also change witch OS boots first by booting to Windows 7 and typing msconfig in the start menu search box. Run the program, select the startup tab, and move Ubuntu up or down. The problem with this is that when the computer reboots and boots into Ubuntu, Ubuntu can't change the Windows 7 bootloader settings to allow you back into Windows again. So, hunt around in your BIOS settings and see if you can find something that enables the USB keyboard. If not, buy a wired keyboard.\n\nA: I know this is old post but thought if any one else has this problem, I have the same pc and what I do is unplug the USB keyboard, mouse dongle and then instantly plug it back in, works for me.  \n", "Q: converting images to pdf without quality loss I am converting images to PDFs. I use following command\nconvert page.jpg page.pdf\n\nand then combine multiple PDFs generated accordingly by command\npdftk 1.pdf 2.pdf output result.pdf\n\nbut I noticed loss of quality in the resulting PDF. Is there some way that I can retain the quality of the PDF i. e. I want the same quality in PDF as in the image.\nI am not sure if this convert command is using the imagemagick library. Is there any better solution? I have 100s of PDFs, so I have to do it via command line.\n\nA: Although the author of the question specifies the need to use command line because of the high number of image files, I have to say that the comment made by Tom Brossman related to LibreOfficeWriter is the best answer to the question, because it includes the solution to a nasty problem (presented below) that may appear especially when dealing with many images.I stumbled upon this problem and tried a few options - from the Termial, using Gimp and such, and using the 'printing as file' feature, but have to conclude that the 'drag and drop'+'Export as PDF' in LibreOfficeWriter is the best, because:\n1) you can already see before exporting images as pdfs if there are any differences between these images as they will appear in the final pdf. What I mean is that despite similar sizes in bytes and aspect ratio, when importing jpeg-s or png-s into a pdf, some pages may appear much smaller than the others, without any difference in quality in fact, but just because they seem to be 'focused' differently and displayed at a different scale. (I cannot understand the cause of this and welcome a comment that would enlighten me, I just stumbled into this when putting very similar images into a pdf file, as seen below.)  \n \nWhen looking at the images before converting them into a pdf, you cannot anticipate this error, but LibreOfficeWriter makes it visible and also very easy to correct: just grab the margin of the image, put it into the appropriate form into the page, and it will appear as such in the final pdf.\n\n2) And, when exporting ('File'- 'Export as PDF...') you have several options that let you control the final quality/size of the pdf, which could be very useful if you need to send it by mail and still keep some image quality.\n\n\nA: I dont know if this is definitely the answer to your question as i am not used to the convert program. PDF is not an image file format, its is a way of formatting documents so that they can be represented consistently not matter what hardware/software you are viewing it from. Therefore when you \"convert\" the image from JPEG to PDF the JPEG is not actually being converted. The JPEG is embedded in the PDF file itself and the PDF file tells your document viewer how to display the contents on the screen/page.\nI imagine the loss of quality you are seeing is because of the program with which you are viewing the files. When you view the jpeg with GNOME image viewer the image is displayed exactly as it should be, say and 800x600px image is layout out perfectly on 800x600 pixels on the screen. But when you open your PDF in Document Viewer the viewer lays the 800x600px image out over maybe 25x15cm (or whatever) of the document which when viewed at 100% may not be exactly 800x600 pixels of screen space, it may be more therefore stretching the image and reducing the quality.\n\nA: Based on your comment I tried the links and I see what the problem is. You issue is with the heavy compression that Issuu applies to the pages, and with the Flash interface used to display the page as a lossy image.  \nYour conversion of images to PDF is just fine, the quality loss is occurring when Issuu converts your PDF to their proprietary Flash format and serves it up on the site.\n\nA: I have used https://pic2pdf.net in order to convert jpeg files to pdf without quality loss and attached to word file. It may workout for this situation.\n", "Q: How to change LUKS passphrase? Having installed Ubuntu 11.10 with whole disk encryption and LVM, I need to provide a way for users to easily change LUKS passphrase.\nPreferably, this should be done using GUI tools, thus, enabling novice users to perform this basic task.\n\nA: I am not familiar with GUI tool but cryptsetup is the tool to interact with LUKS.\nBasically AFAIK LUKS lets you add 8 passphrase slots and you can do that with:\nsudo cryptsetup -y luksAddKey ENCRYPTED_PARTITION\nsudo cryptsetup luksRemoveKey ENCRYPTED_PARTITION\n\nwhere 0 is the slot number. I guess LUKS stores slots as 0,1,2 etc. But I recommend you to be very careful with LUKS as you may lock yourself out. Please refer to manual of cryptsetup. Also I recommend you to visit other distro IRC channel just to be extra safe before you proceed.\nYou may need to reboot the machine and try your new passsphrase as well before you remove the key. \ncryptsetup FAQ\nEdit: Seems like gnome-disks (AKA gnome-disk-utility) lets you change the passphrase.\n\n\n\nA: Tested in Ubuntu 14.04: Search for the \"Disks\" application\nSelect Device, select volume, Click cogs (more actions) -> \"Change passphrase\"\n\n\n\nA: Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 run gnome-disks and you can point and click to change the passphrase for the encryption. In the same manner as the accepted answer above.\n\nA: cryptsetup luksChangeKey <target device> -S <target key slot number>\n\nThis will ask you first for a valid pass-phrase (in any enabled keyslot) then will prompt you fro the new passphrase in the target keyslot.\nFrom man page:\n\n--key-slot, -S <0-7>\n  For LUKS operations that add key material, this options allows you to specify which key slot is selected for the new key.  This option can be used for luksFormat,  and luksAddKey.\n  In  addition,  for  open,  this  option  selects a specific key-slot to compare the passphrase against.

In the newest version of Gwibber, there are several tabs. I get the Replies, Private Messages, etc., however, I can't seem to find what the difference is between Home and Messages. On seems to refresh more than the other, or something, but other than that they seem to hold the same content.\n\nA: From Ken VanDine in a thread I found in a bug report:\n\nThe \"Home\" stream is everything, an aggregation of all the other\n  streams.  The others are there to help you filter the results and just\n  view what you want...  The \"Replies\" tab does include mentions, not just replies to your posts.  \n\nA fuller explanation is here, in another bug report:  \n\nIn regard to which stream is selected by default, in the past gwibber\n  did default to selecting the all messages tab. However, lots of people\n  complained because it included streams like links, which for facebook\n  at least, includes posts from facebook games. So depending who your\n  friends are, lots of noise there. The rationale behind to changing\n  that to default to \"messages\" was it was really a stream of your\n  friends \"status updates\". Which is something people seem most\n  interesting in seeing. I am not opposed to changing it back to default\n  to all messages, but we need some consensious on that, we can't make\n  everyone happy.\nIn general we need to spend some time looking at what we call the\n  streams, we have generalized them between all the services, but\n  \"messages\" isn't really messages, it is \"status updates\".\n\n", "Q: Intel 852GME driver UPDATE 1:\nSo just to finalise the question/answer, it is not possible for me to install the correct drivers for my laptop on Ubuntu 10.04.

How do they do that? \nWith my current implementation, I need to restart my app in order to get the right icon.\n\nA: Tomboy does not actually have a code for detecting theme changes.

I'm in the process of doing a system re-install. I've seen: How to backup settings and list of installed packages \nThere are a couple of specific apps I want to double check that all their data/metadata will be saved if I copy my home directory (with hidden directories). So I wanted to ask where Banshee stores the metadata about podcast subscriptions, old vs new podcasts, and playlists, etc.\n\nA: This can be answered visiting the Banshee FAQ page on their website, namely this section of it:\n\nWhere does Banshee store configuration files/the library database?\n      It is stored under ~/.config/banshee-1/. The library database itself is called banshee.db and is a SQLite 3 database.\n\nIt is then kept at the home of the user under the folder /.config/banshee-1/ and its a SQLite3 database.\nTo be able to open such a file you can use most of the SQL browsers out there that support SQLite3 file database connections.\nOne of such utilities is sqlitebrowser, look for it in the Ubuntu Software Center or install the package with apt-get in a terminal.\nI am assuming that if you save the .db file (just copy it or the complete folder to another location) you will be just able to restore it to a new installation as long as the Banshee versions are not so far apart.\n", "Q: How to encrypt ubuntu filesystems only? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to encrypt ubuntu filesystems only? \n\nFriends,\nI have Windows 7 ultimate 64bit and Ubuntu 11.10 64bit version.

I found that when I open two terminal and exit any one, it will cause the other can't input any character.\nI found that I can use alt+tab change the focus to other program and change back can temporarily back the normal state , but every time when I exit terminal will cause this problem again.\nHow to fix it?\n\nA: No idea on the actual answer, but as a workaround, can you open more than one tab in your terminal program and try that instead of separate terminal windows?  It won't look the way you want it to, but it should provide the same functionality.\nI use konsole on kubuntu (kde) and it supports multiple tabs.  I'm sure there is a similar program for your environment.\nAlso, if you open your second terminal from within your first terminal - from the command line, you may see some error messages there (in the original terminal) when you close the new terminal that may provide clues as to what the problem is.\n", "Q: LAMP server installation stops at 79% configuring MySQL (EC2 BitNami AMI) I have created an ubuntu 10.04 cloud server on the Amazon cloud (EC2) I am encountering a stalled LAMP install each time I try it.  I've created about 5 fresh instances.  Each time The installation gets stuck at 79% on the \"configuring mysql-server-5.1\" portion of the install.\nFirst I do an update (sudo apt-get update) then an upgrade (sudo apt-get upgrade) then try to install the lamp using tasksel.    \nI've done this before on a rackspace cloud server and it works fine.  Every single attempt fails on EC2 instances.  I will contact Amazon but I am also asking here in case it is an ubuntu specific issue and possibly a known issue that someone can guide me towards solving.\nThe region is EU West (Ireland).  The AMI Id is ami-00e9d874.  The instance type is m1.large.\nI've tried several different AMIs though (all ubuntu x64 10.04)\n\nA: If you start with a standard Ubuntu 10.04 AMI published by Canonical, then installing LAMP with tasksel works just fine.  For us-west-1, the latest 64-bit 10.04 AMI is ami-81dde2f5.\nThe AMI you specified (ami-00e9d874) is a BitNami AMI.  It looks like BitNami already has MySQL installed on that AMI using a non-standard location (/opt/bitnami/mysql).  When you try to install MySQL with the standard Ubuntu tools, it does not detect the BitNami MySQL and then fails trying to run a second MySQL server:\n120116  0:09:09 [Note] Plugin 'FEDERATED' is disabled.\n120116  0:09:09  InnoDB: Started; log sequence number 0 44233\n120116  0:09:09 [ERROR] Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use\n120116  0:09:09 [ERROR] Do you already have another mysqld server running on port: 3306 ?\n120116  0:09:09 [ERROR] Aborting\n\n120116  0:09:09  InnoDB: Starting shutdown...\n120116  0:09:10  InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 0 44233\n120116  0:09:10 [Note] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Shutdown complete\n\nIf you need to use a BitNami AMI, you'll need to follow their directions for installing LAMP.\n\nA: You are using the BitNami Drupal AMI and as Eric mentions it includes MySQL. In fact it includes a LAMP Server installed and Drupal running on top of it. The idea of this AMI is to provide a ready to use Drupal installation in which the user will not need to worry about setting the environment.\nIn the /opt/bitnami directory you can see that BitNami includes apache, mysql and php folders. It also includes a properties.ini file that includes information about the installed components. The apache configuration file is in /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/httpd.conf, the php configuration file is in /opt/bitnami/php/etc/php.ini file and the mysql configuration is in /opt/bitnami/mysql/my.cnf. You can use these servers for running other applications on top of it. \nIf you want to install the system servers the default ports will conflict with BitNami. To avoid this you can execute /etc/init.d/bitnami stop and stop the BitNami servers. If you want to have both running (BitNami and system servers) you will need to configure some of them to use different ports. Apart of that, you should not find any other conflict. BitNami is completely independent from the system components and you can upgrade, install or remove system libraries without breaking the BitNami installation. In the same way, BitNami will not affect your system software (other than the port conflict that I already mentioned.\nI'm part of the BitNami team and I thought that adding this clarification will be useful for understanding why you were finding that problem with BitNami.\n\nA: I also had my installation hang at 79%. In my case I was not using bitnami, just regular apt install mysql-server and the same thing happend with sudo tasksel of LAMP Stack.\nIn my specific case it turns out my root mysql password had singe quote in it, and that was messing up the mysql configuration step.\nI saw this by checking the log I believe it was in /var/log/mysql.\nIn the logs it should half of my password split on the ' character which gave me the idea to try using a different password.\n", "Q: The volume “boot” has only 0 byte disk space remaining \nPossible Duplicate:\nFree up more space on /boot \n\nI am in Ubuntu

using Synaptic Package Manager tool?\n\n\nA: Run sudo apt-get remove linux-image-<version> in a terminal for every kernel you don't need.\nAs an example sudo apt-get remove linux-image-2.6.32-21-generic will remove the 2.6.32-21-generic version of the kernel and all the associated files. This will free up space on the /boot partition.\nTo find out which one you should keep, run uname -r. In your specific case, the ones you can safely remove are versions:\n2.6.32-21-generic and 2.6.32-28-generic - 2.6.32-36-generic\n\nA: Open synaptic. Search for \"linux-image\". Select all versions that you dont use (probably 2.6.32-36-generic and below).

I've heard that is possible to build customized versions of Ubuntu in different languages.\nWhat are these and how can I make one?  \n\nA: What is an Ubuntu localized image?\nDue to space restrictions, the official Ubuntu installation CDs (also known as ISO images) that can be downloaded from ubuntu.com contain only a handful of the many languages in which Ubuntu is available. Any additional languages can then be downloaded during or after the installation.\nLocalized images are customized versions of the original media, which are modified to include the translation of a particular language or other modifications that are relevant to a particular location.\nThey make it possible to have native language support upon installation and without the need of a working Internet connection. In addition to the language, they also enable customizing other aspects of Ubuntu to make it more relevant to a particular culture or region.\nHow can I create a localized image?\nSet up the tools\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Ubuntu defaults builder\n\n*Install the packaging tools\nSet up a defaults package\nThe next step is to create a defaults package with all the customizations for your language. This package will be used as a template containing the parameters to build the final image. \nNow run the build script to create the default package:\nubuntu-defaults-template {defaultspackagename}\ncd {defaultspackagename}\n\nRemember to substitute {defaultspackagename} by the name of your package. The convention for package names is ubuntu-defaults-{locale}, where {locale} is the 2-letter or 3-letter ISO 639-2 code for your locale. E.g. a defaults package for a Catalan-speaking region would be ubuntu-defaults-ca\nAt this point you can modify all the relevant settings to your locale in the .txt files in that directory. They are all documented and contain examples.\nBuild the defaults package\nWhat you created in the previous step is a source package, which you now need to build in order to make it an installable package.\nNow run the following command to build the package:\ndpkg-buildpackage\n\nIf all goes well, you'll have a package with a .deb extension on the parent folder. Something like myprojectdefaults_0.1_all.deb\nBuild your ISO image from the local package\nNow run the command to create the image. You will need a working Internet connection and a couple of GB free to be able to run the command. This will take some minutes to complete-\nubuntu-defaults-image --package  ../myprojectdefaults_0.1_all.deb\n\nThe resulting image is the one with the .iso extension\nNote: as an alternative to using a local package, you can set up a PPA and use the following command (this example assumes you've named your package ubuntu-defaults-ca in the PPA):\nubuntu-defaults-image --ppa  lpusername/ppaname  --locale ca\n\nCheck out the man page to learn about additional options \nTest\nDo a local test of your image (e.g. you can install it in a virtual machine with Virtualbox)\nFinally, upload the image on a public location for everyone to download and test.\nThat's it!\nExample 1: creating a localized image for Catalan from a package\nAssuming all tools are installed, we can just run the commands to create a localized ISO for Catalan-speaking regions:\nubuntu-defaults-template ubuntu-defaults-ca\ncd ubuntu-defaults-ca\n\nAt this point we modify the required files to install the Catalan language packs and select the Catalan keyboard. We modify the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*i18n/keyboard.txt -> specifying 'es cat' as the keyboard\n\n*i18n/langpacks.txt -> specifying 'ca complete' as a language pack\n\n*i18n/language.txt -> specifying 'ca' as the language code\n\n\nAnd then we continue building the defaults package and the image:\ndpkg-buildpackage\nubuntu-defaults-image --package ../ubuntu-defaults-ca_0.1_all.deb\n\nExample 2: creating a localized image for Catalan from a PPA\nThis example assumes we've already created a PPA with a defaults package, so the only thing we'll need to do will be to run the command to respin the ISO:\nubuntu-defaults-image --ppa dpm/ubuntu-defaults-ca --locale ca\n\n", "Q: What is the equivalent of 'Control-Alt-Delete'? On Windows anytime the system hangs Ctrl-Alt-Del brings up the Start Up Manager, from which you can end the program or process causing the hang.\nIs there any command like this on Ubuntu?\n\nA: you could have a short command for opening a terminal, I have F4. \nWhen you need to force an application to quit just open a terminal and type xkill and then click in the window of the application that has crashed. \nGNOME-shell\n\n\n*\n\n*System --> Preferences --> keyboard shortcuts\n(gnome-keybinding-properties)\n\n*go down to the Desktop list, click on Run a terminal then\nhold your short command.\nthe short command should be visible in the line on the right.  \nTo kill a process\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal. (Or just use Alt+F2.)\n\n*Type: xkill\n\n*Click in the window that has crashed.\n\n\nHaving a short command for opening a terminal is a good idea in general because you can do other things as well. (htop, system monitor, rebooting, etc.)\n\nA: System-monitor is what your looking for. You can launch it by typing system-monitor in the Unity Dash.\n\nA: To stay in the spirit of magical shortcuts, here are some : \n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl+alt+backspace combination (disabled on default on 11.10) that can restart the GUI.\n\n*ctrl+alt+F2 to F6, that will display a console from which you could login and then eventually kill the stucked application. Once you killed it you can return to the GUI by pressing alt-f7. Killing an application by name can be done by using this command: \nsudo killall <name-of-the-application>\n\nIf this doesn't work, use the -9 flag to kill it with überforce.\nsudo killall -9 <name-of-the-application>\n\n\n*IN CASE OF EMERGENCY : use the Magic SysReq Key to directly \"speak\" to the kernel.\n\n\nA: You can add a custom keyboard command using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings\n\n*Click Keyboard\n\n*Open the Shortcuts tab\n\n*Click the \"+\" symbol near the bottom of the window\n\n*Give your command a title. E.g. System Monitor\n\n*In the Command field, enter gnome-system-monitor\n\n*Click Apply\n\n*Click Disabled on your newly created shortcut\n\n*Enter the key combination you want for your shortcut. E.g. Ctrl+Alt+M\nNote: on Ubuntu 14.10, Ctrl+Alt+Del is already in use, but can be overridden.\n\nA: I had the same question. The answer I was looking for was: \"type top on terminal\"\nWith top you can see which processes are working on your Linux and decide which one has to be killed.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 17.10 with GNOME, ALT+F4 is the default to close a window. As per this answer, after setting CTRL+ALT+Backspace to gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options, with the Brave browser open it just pulls down or up the menu toolbar, while with other applications it does nothing. CTRL+ALT+DEL will bring you back to the default screen after 60 s, at least if the system hasn't hung, and will pop up a window prompting to cancel or confirm log out. CTRL+ALT+ESC does nothing by default.\nSo if you want to bind opening the system monitor, either change the shortcut binding for log out to something else, or use another shortcut.\nThis is how to set a shortcut for xkill. \n\nYou can open this window by searching for keyboard shortcuts in activities. I've used CTRL+Suoer+ESC since CTRL+ALT+ESC is taken for switching the system controls directly (which toggles the menu toolbar in Brave, but in the terminal it doesn't seem to do anything).\nFor gnome-system-monitor, I've chosen to bind it to CTRL+ALT+DEL, after changing the default/built-in log out shortcut from CTRL+ALT+DEL to CTRL+ALT+L.\n\nA: System Monitor shows you an overview of running applications (under the Processes tab) and allows you to end them by right-clicking on the name and selecting the respective context menu item. You can set up keyboard shortcuts in the Keyboard settings (Shortcuts tab), so you can bind Ctrl+Alt+Del to gnome-system-monitor, the command to start System Monitor.\nAnother command you might be interested in is xkill. This is traditionally bound to Ctrl+Alt+Esc (not sure if by default) and allows you to click on a misbehaving window to close it.\nBoth of these might not work if your entire system hangs. If that happens, there are two things you can do. The first has to be enabled in advance when your system doesn't hang yet (you could do it right now): open Keyboard Layout settings (I believe this is merged into Keyboard in Ubuntu 12.04), then click Options. One of the options is Key sequence to kill the X server, you can click that run gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options for recent versions of Ubuntu (according to this answer). If you have done that and your system later hangs, you can press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, which will effectively bring you back to the login screen.\nIf even that doesn't work, the last thing you can do is ensuring a sane shutdown (i.e. not pressing and holding the power button). This one is a bit hard to remember, but it involves pressing and holding Alt+SysRq (system request, often same key as PrtScr print screen) and then while holding those two keys press one at a time in order R, E, I, S, U, B (a mnemonic is Reboot Even If System Utterly Broken, but may also be easily remembered as \"BUSIER\" backwards). Wait a second between each press, because each letter is a different kernel action leading to a \"graceful\" reset.\n\nA: It may not be relevant to your question but I found chrome in ubuntu has its own task manager.

I would like to install Ubuntu on my Windows 7 64-bit PC to do analysis of astronomy data. The data files are often large (can be few hundred MB, possibly a GB). The data files may be located on an external hard disk. The PC has 6 GB RAM and 670 GB hard disk. \nI'm trying to decide whether to do a proper dual-boot, installing Ubuntu in its own partition (I'm nervous of messing around with the hard disk, have never done it before) or to run Ubuntu using VirtualBox in Windows. How much slower is running in Virtualbox likely to be? \nIf I do go for a traditional dual-boot, would it make sense to divide the hard disk more or less equally between the two OSs?\nI would be very grateful for some advice.\nMany thanks\nKevin\n\nA: If the application you will be running is CPU and RAM intensive then it will be best for you to install Ubuntu natively rather than virtually. If you do decide to dual-boot and will only be using Ubuntu as a secondary OS there is no need to give it such a large partition unless you will be storing large files on the partition itself (but you said that your files were on an external HD). Ubuntu would be able to access the windows partition (NTFS) if you wanted to store things there anyway. Therefore you should give the Ubuntu partition ~20GB (to be on the safe side) and it will also require a swap partition that is the slighlty larger than the amount of RAM you have.\nIf you will only be using Ubuntu temporarily then you may want to look at Wubi which will simplify the installation and removal by doing it from within Windows. The downside of Wubi is that read and write speeds to the HD are slightly slower. This may not bother you.\n\nA: You are right to be cautious. Installing an OS can cause problems.\nWhat I suggest:\nFirst - Run Ubuntu live. This allows you to test your hardware and decide if you want to install Ubuntu. Keep in mind, it will run a bit slower when running from a CD or USB.\nSecond - If you decide to install, back up your data first.\nThird - Resize your windows c:\\ partition with the partitioning tools withing windows 7. Leave the resulting free space unformatted.\nYou could use the Ubuntu installer to partition your hard drive if you wish. You might get complaints from windows if you do (which can be fixed).\nThe read the install guide, make sure you understand how linux identifies partitions (/dev/sda ...) and install Ubuntu. Personally, if you have the space, I would suggest 40 Gb for Ubuntu. You can easily use as little as 10-20 Gb, and I have done installs on as little as 3.5 Gb, but it is not much fun to run out of hard drive space and I am guessing you can easily spare 40 Gb or so.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\nAs long as you do the preparation the risks of data loss or other problems are minimal. People seem to run into problems when they rush to install without understanding the install process or when they use the advanced options of the installer (to change the defaults) without understanding what they are changing. The defaults work just fine for the vast majority of people and you should not change them without understanding the changes you are making.\n\nA: If you too worried to mess with partitioning, you can install WUBI. Wubi is an officially supported Ubuntu installer for Windows users. It can install and uninstall Ubuntu in the same way as any other Windows application. It's simple and safe. Run the download file\nIf you need any extra help, take a look at the Wubi Guide or ask a question in the Wubi forum.\nAfter the file is downloaded, you have to open it to run the installer. You will find the detailed instructions below. If you need further help, the various support options are listed at the bottom of this page.\nIf you are using Internet Explorer, you'll be asked whether you want to run or save the file. Choose 'Run' to launch the installer.\nMost other browsers, like Firefox, will only ask you to save the file. Click 'Save' and then double-click the downloaded file to launch the installer.\n3.Install it\nIf a security message like this appears, click 'Continue' to proceed with the installation.\nTo install Ubuntu, all you need to do is choose your username and password. Please note that you have to enter your password twice to make sure you typed it correctly.\nAfter choosing your password, click 'Install'. The files will be downloaded and installed automatically.\nWait until Ubuntu is downloaded and installed. Please note that the whole process can take a while – the downloaded file size is 700MB\nWhen the installation is complete, you will be prompted to restart your computer. Click 'Finish' to restart.\nAfter your computer restarts, choose 'Ubuntu' from the boot menu.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer\n\nA: I would try it on VirtualBox first, not because I'd be hesitant to partition the disk (it's not hard), but it doesn't make much sense to me to boot into Ubuntu only to crunch numbers if you need to be on Windows to do everything else. I've never done much that's computationally expensive, but I've never gotten Ubuntu over 2GB of RAM—it sounds like you have plenty. It might run a little slower due to sharing CPU with Windows; how much slower, I couldn't say. It's not hard to try, however.\nIf it does what you need, great—you haven't messed around with your hard disk and you don't have to reboot just to analyze data.\nIf you need something more, you can go from there, whether you use Wubi or partition your disk.

I installed Xubuntu 11.10 on an old Windows XP in a separate partition. Later, I realized that I should have installed Lubuntu 11.10. Is there an easy way I can delete Xubuntu and replace it with a clean install of Lubuntu without deleting the partition? If not, what's the best way to delete Xubuntu and start over? By the way, this is my very first Linux install so I'm a definite newbie and would really like advice that does not involve using command lines. Thanks.\n\nA: Well I know you want advice that does not involve command lines but you only have to copy and paste one line into the terminal. (although you'll need a root terminal)\nOpen a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T usually works)\ntype \nsudo -i\nenter your password\ncopy and paste (paste in a terminal is CTRL+SHIFT+V) in:\napt-get install lubuntu-desktop -y && apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop -y\nThat's it\nthe \"apt-get install\" bit installs the ldxe desktop environment and all the programs that go with it, the \"apt-get remove\" bit removes all of xubuntu. You could also run apt-get autoremove to make sure everything has gone. Or you can just reinstall by downloading lubuntu and selecting remove xubuntu and install lubuntu instead during the install process.\n\nA: I don't know how to answer the first question but the second I can handle:\nBest way to delete and start over is to format a usb key so it's FAT32 and then use a program like unetbootin to create a bootable disk. \nThen all you need to do is set your bios so your computer boots from USB. You can do this at start-up by pressing one of the F keys (f2 or f4 or f8 something, I can't remember and it's different on each computer anyway - I just press them all and it usually works out ;-)) then you go into the page of the bios and change the order so USB is it's the first on the boot priority list.\nOnce you did this you need to save and exit it (be careful in the Bios too if you are not sure about anything I have said it is best to ask before fiddling about in there). Then reboot your computer and the lubuntu installer should prompt you for what to do next.\nAfter that your computer will be all better. \n\nA: Yes, you can. You need a liveCD/liveusb Lubuntu. Insert it in your PC, boot in live mode. Open GParted and select your Xubuntu partition. Right-click and choose format/reformat to ext. Do not delete that partition. Just reformat it. Apply changes in GParted and close it. Click the Install Lubuntu icon. Install Lubuntu to the partition you just reformatted.\n\nA: Just use the software center or Synaptic to add the Lubuntu package, and boot into Lubuntu instead of Xubuntu on boot. Simple as that.\nThe answer from   Uri Herrera Jan 13 '12 at 22:51 is correct.\n", "Q: custom print commands in gnome I work in a situation where printing requires a script that I have written.\nI'm wondering how to add a command (in this case, my script) as a printer in gnome so that it appears in applications like evince.\nMy goal is to be able to print from evince through the script that I wrote.\n\nA: Can you try adding it as a custom print option? If you go to System Settings/ Printing/ right-click your default printer  Properties/ Job Options there is an option to manually add something there:  \n \nCan you test and see if your script (or a pointer to it) can be entered here?\n\nA: Few options my side:\n\n*\n\n*Share that printer into network through CUPS/IPP\n\n\n*If it has an internal port but for some reasons don't want to open it to network.

If I interrupt the boot, choose F6 to bring up that boot parameter list and then proceed, it will boot strait into the live user.  \nHow do I avoid ubiquity for an unattended boot? \n\nA: This isn't a direct answer to your problem but a workaround I guess.

Ubuntu has Open Office as part of the install. Occasionally, when using XP, I need to work on a spreadsheet or other Open Office document but can't seem to access them while using Windows XP. Is there a way that XP can crossover to Ubuntu documents?  Are two different versions of Adobe also needed?\n\nA: While using XP, you can access your Ubuntu partition with Ext2Fsd.\nIt is an ext3 and ext4 driver for Windows XP, Vista and 7.\nhttp://www.ext2fsd.com/\n\nA: The \"problem\" is that Windows can not use ext4 (ubuntu) partitions easily.\nMy advices would be to mounting your windows partition in Ubuntu and save your documents on your windows drive in your home folder.\nYou can configure the windows partition to mount with a graphical tool, ntfs-config\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nThen run it with gksu\ngksu ntfs-config\n\n\nAlternately your can save your documents to a shared device such as a flash drive, or make a separate shared data partition.\nSee Ubuntu wiki mount windows partition for details.\n\nA: I know this won't allow you to use open office on both, but I use online storage such as Drop Box to store my files instead of an USB stick.  This way at least your documents can be used with both office and open office.  \n\nA: Both the previous answers are acceptable. The primary issue is how to make the file available to both operating systems.\nBodhi's answer allows you to make the NTFS partition of Windows mount automatically (you could do it manually on an as needed basis).\ngiowck's answer shows how to mount the ext3/4 file system on Windows.\n---- some other potential solutions ----\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a data partition using FAT32 or NTFS that both Ubuntu and Windows can mount. This avoids the issue of mounting the other operating systems system partition.\n\n*Use a USB drive/stick to store documents on (tedious)\n\n*Use a file server or NAS (Network Attached Storage) device to store the files on\n\n*Use Ubuntu One to sync the files between both systems\n\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/downloads/windows/\n\nThis will avoid having to mount other partitions or make additional partitions. You will need an Internet connection for synchronization though.\n\nA: To answer the Adobe portion of the question. In order to read .pdf files you will need a(an) program/application that handles PDF files. For Windows you can use Adobe Reader or Foxit reader. For Ubuntu, you can search the software center for PDF and get several good options. I believe you'll find Adobe Reader and Foxit reader there as well.  \nYou can also store your PDF files in a separate \"shared\" FAT32 or NTFS partition.\n", "Q: how can I set my bash window title to the last command that ran?

I am using the 64-bit iso (ubuntu-11.10-desktop-amd64.iso) and I set the architecture to x86_64 but when I install the VM it installs the 32 bit kernel. The CPU in the VM reports supporting 64-bit but the kernel but uname -m reports i686.\n\nA: Okay, My answer consist of two sections:\n1. Short Answer : You can't run a 64bit VM on a 32-bit processor. However, you can run a 64bit VM if you have a 64bit processor but have installed a 32bit host OS and your processor supports the right extensions. \n2. Long Answer :\nMake sure your processor supports virtualization extensions. Both AMD and Intel have processors that support this technology. You can check it from the /proc/cpuinfo file. Look at the flags section for one of two values, vmx or svm.\nvmx - (Intel)\nsvm - (AMD)\nIssue this command, egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo. If your system supports VT, then you will see vmx or svm in the list of flags. An example output would be, \n\nflags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge\n  mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm syscall\n  nx lm constant_tsc pni monitor ds_cpl vmx est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr\n  lahf_lm\n\nNOTE : These flags say that your processor supports VT technology. However, VT technology can still be disabled in your computer’s BIOS. So make sure it has enabled from BIOS.\nOptionally, you can use one of these tools, Processor Check for 64-Bit Compatibility from VMWare or Intel® Processor Identification Utility\nAccording to this document from VMWare,\n\n64-bit guest operating system support: 64-bit guest operating systems will run on 64-bit hardware independent of the type of host operating system. 64-bit guest operating systems offer direct access to more memory than 32-bit systems ...\n\nTherefore, if your processor supports 64bit architecture and has VT extensions, you can run 64bit VMs.\nAssume this info will help you :)\n", "Q: \"Required version of distribute not available\" when installing IMAPClient I'm receiving the following error when I run the command \"easy_install imapclient\":\nReading package lists...

I modified /usr/bin/easy_install script and removed the version constraint for distribute, so it now looks like this:\n#! /usr/bin/python\n# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'distribute','console_scripts','easy_install'\n__requires__ = 'distribute'\nimport sys\nfrom pkg_resources import load_entry_point\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    sys.exit(\n        load_entry_point('distribute', 'console_scripts', 'easy_install')()\n    )\n\n\nA: I had the same problem on the same version of Ubuntu (but 32-bit instead of 64).\nThe problem is that our old version of pip and easy_install is trying to install newer python modules that require newer versions of distribute than our version of pip/easy_install likes. And like X-Cubed pointed out, easy_install (hence pip) requires a specific, old version of distribute. X-Cubed's solution worked for me, but instead of eliminating the version I set it to a minimum, so that other easy_installs (and pips) can require lower versions, if necessary. So the /usr/bin/easy_install lines that changed are:\n__requires__ = 'distribute>0.6.10'\n\nand \nload_entry_point('distribute>0.6.10', 'console_scripts', 'easy_install')()\n\nPresumably distribute plays nice and is always reverse compatible. If so this will cause fewer problems than easy_install requiring a specific version of distribute that doesn't work for many python modules.\nThen I reran pip for my requirements (pip install requirements/*) which needed the URLObject python module, and it got through the version conflict issue just fine after I made this change. (so X-Cubed was at least partially right and probably 100% right).\nThis sed will also fix it\nsudo sed -i -r -e 's/distribute==/distribute>/g' /usr/bin/easy_install\n\n", "Q: I still have 9.04 but it's on an old computer without a cd burner.

There may be a network problem.'\nAny suggestions or ways to work around this problem?\n\nA: Ubuntu 9.10 is beyond EOL (End of Life). You might be able to upgrade if you specify the old mirror, but, realistically you are almost certainly better off installing Lubuntu 11.10.\nFor an older mirror, see Can I keep using Ubuntu 9.04 if it's outdated?\nIn the absence of a CD drive , can you boot a flash drive ? If so, you can make a bootable flash drive with Unetbootin .\n\nA: bodhi.zazen was right on it with the lubuntu.  Don't forget that there are tons of other alternative distros to consider when dealing with an older computer.  When I'm trying to make better use of old hardware, the first disro I usually try is simply Debian.  I'll trial some different interfaces like lxde, xfce, fluxbox, and the like until I find one that works well with my machine's resources.\nUbuntu will also support lighter interfaces like the above.  In fact, I've got 11.10 installed to one of my development machines, but because it is close to 29,000 years old; I use the xfce environment.\nlike bodhi.zazen mentioned, you need to check into whether or not your machine is usb bootable.  If not, can you boot it from an sd card?\nAnother option is to learn some terminal kung fu.  Actually, if I were given the challenge to upgrade 9.04 to 9.10; as my only option.

Both system are not identical, one is AMD pc and one is Intel pc. So it confuses me why the problem occurs cause im not doing a clean install, i just use the same previous hardisk directly on the systems. I just find the solutions yesterday when i use live cd on the system, it seems that the configurations are messed up because of maybe the previous configuration of ubuntu. So this is the solutions i did:\nSolution 1. Just create a new administator / user account. Your new account should work as it should. No unity freezing when minimize from a maximized window.\nSolution 2.

However, you look like you've incorrectly used this package.\nThe usual way to-do this is to connect your laptop via a wired connection to the internet.\nThen launch the Additional Drivers window.  From there you will be able to activate you Broadcom driver.\nFrom the command-line, this is similar - you just install the package:\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter\n\nGiven that you said that you dont have a wired connection then you will need to use the community instructions to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab the b43-fwcutter package off the live USB/Live CD and install it\n\n*Using another computer that is connected to the internet, download the firmware\n\n*Then using some terminal commands, extract the firmware and install it\n\n*Activate the new b43 driver\n\n\nA: You can download packages from the packages.ubuntu.com web page anytime.\nTo find whick package you need, start the Additional drivers or jockey-gtk, and activate the driver. If I am correct, it will produce an error, which is stored into a log (it will be in the error message). Read the log, and the package you will need will be there. Grab it with the other laptop.

Thanks!\n\nA: I managed to figure out a workaround, though I imagine there's a better solution out there. I looked at what was happening when my lid was closed and opened in /etc/acpi/lid.sh and found that xscreensaver was being called upon automatically. Not sure if different laptops have different settings and whatnot - I really don't know too much about this stuff.\nIn any case, I tried to make it simply obey its config file and not lock, but couldn't figure it out, so I ended up simply deleting the lines that involved xscreensaver. Now everything works great: no locking, and if the lid is closed passed the amount of time which you have set for xscreensaver to start, it'll start normally (and not lock).\nI'm still not sure why xscreensaver is set up to be called automatically when the lid is closed or why it ignores its settings and locks when the lid is opened. I also don't get why with my older laptop this only happens sporadically (sometimes it locks every time, sometimes not at all), despite having the same lid.sh file.\nI should also note that I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity, though I don't think that'll make any difference. \n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 Classic (meaning Unity, I think), and had the same trouble. Here's what I wanted: When the screen is not locked, closing and reopening the lid should not cause the screen to lock.\nThis is easily achievable by dconf-editor; simply browse to org > gnome > desktop > screensaver and uncheck the lock-enabled entry.\nPS: It seems easy to do, but the answer was hard to find.\n\nA: Since GTK3 i have used\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen 'true'\n\n\nThis will prevent all lock-screens. If you still want to be able to lock the screen you can use 'Switch User Account...' as a substitute.

In Ubuntu, once a release is out the software one has installed receives security updates only. In Windows, I can get new versions of programs with new features. How can Windows do this and why can't Ubuntu?\n\nA: Ubuntu follows a standard release cycle such that software is well tested and stable between releases, and you go from one release to the other by upgrading.  On the other hand there are distributions that use a rolling release cycle, where packages are continuously updated (most famous are Gentoo, Arch Linux).\nSince you're comparing with Windows, I'm too far out of date, so you can answer that part yourself I hope.  I haven't used that OS in a decade.\n\nA: short answer: it can\nlong answer: it doesn't by default, in order to provide stability\ni use pinning and aptitude to pick and choose what versions to install, giving me a mix of stability and up-to-date-ness.\n\nA: This is a problem that the Ubuntu Software Center team is in the progress of solving.\nThe problem is that Ubuntu traditionally draws most of its applications from the in-development branch of Debian GNU/Linux—another free operating system—and then \"freezes\" a snapshot of it for inclusion in a release. This body of community-maintained software—called \"the universe\"—consists of 80,000 software packages; Ubuntu developers couldn't possibly provide major updates for all this software, on every supported release, while still maintaining the same level of quality.\nIn order to resolve this issue, Ubuntu has created the MyApps developer portal. Now that Ubuntu is a large platform with over twenty million users, it is hoped that developers will be interested in submitting apps directly to Ubuntu, and release periodic updates to their software across Ubuntu releases.\nFor \"the universe\"—which the Software Center team hopes to eventually be a small fraction of available software—the \"backports\" system of optional software upgrades (which already exists at a half-functional level) will be scaled up.\nThe Software Center interface for major software updates has been designed by a Canonical UI employee, but is not yet implemented:\n\nIf you are interested in the future of application delivery in Ubuntu, I recommend watching Ubuntu Software Center and the Future of the Universe.\n\nA: Canonical (the main sponsors behind ubuntu) decided from the start (v4) that Ubuntu will be distributed on a 6 month cycle.  Every 6 months, the latest/most stable software would be included in the repositories mainly from the unstable/testing branch of debian.\nOutside that cycle you could get the most cutting edge software by compiling software or including additional repositories called PPAs - personal package archives.\nWindows has decided on a different strategy - new features are often (but not always) released with service packs.  It gets worse under windows - it is left to individual software vendors to decide if their software should be automatically updated or not.  IMHO - its a messy strategy and I have often had to rebuild windows due to rogue updates by one software or another.\nOther linux distros have different release strategies.  For example, you could use a rolling-release distro such as Arch.  As and when newer software is released, the maintainers push out the software into their repositories if it is deemed of good enough quality.  Potentially this could lead to potential conflicts between different software since not a full testing suite would have been done.  In practise, the maintainers have done a good job and stability issues I've read are rarely an issue.\nDebian has taken the other route - constantly refining and using a distro based on the most stable packages.  Often much older than in distros such as Ubuntu.\nThus - its for you to decide - (mostly) stability or potential unstability.\n\nA: Ubuntu's update manager works really well by updating not only security fixes but newer versions of software and bug fixes available to packages in the repository, this means updates are tried and tested, known to work and NOT break a system with a newer untested version...\nIf you DO want the newer version then look for and add the repository for say getdeb.net or another source and it will update your package/program to the newest release...\n\nA: Ubuntu can do this as well, but it has different policy. You can use Arch Linux where every single package is updated, but this can force you sometimes to do some things manually, because of limitations in Pacman (Arch package manager).\n\nA: I have to disagree with the blanket statement in the question. \n\"New Feature\" packages are occasionally provided mid-release, sometimes more often than I'd like in my professional capacity. \nFor example, Canonical upgraded CUPS from 1.4.4 to 1.5.0 as a package upgrade to the Ubuntu 11.10 release. While the basic functionality appears to be identical so far, quite a few of the defaults are different and have required modification to our configuration set prior to deployment.\n\nA: By default Ubuntu offers security and recommended updates. A User can if they wish run \"software sources\" and select the updates tab. I usually check the box for unsupported updates (oneiric-backports) which gets me me some newer releases. There is also a check box for Pre-released updates that would expose you to more but occasionally less stable updates. You can also add ppa's for development streams of applications you're interested in. I've added the ppa for gimp which takes me past the gimp 2.6 release to the 2.7 development stream that has some new features that are important to me. Once a ppa is added updates will occur as if they were part of the supported release. This gives me considerable control over stability vs features.\n\nA: This is actually a feature of Ubuntu.\nThere is no problem with updating the software with its latest version, and Ubuntu developers might do it easily. And, actually, it is done in several other Linux distributions, including Arch.\nAs you have noticed, Ubuntu software is updated only with security updates and critical bug fixes. All features are \"frozen\", and after a Ubuntu release no software is updated to a new major version. Although it seems like a disadvantage of Ubuntu, in fact it's one of its pros.\nWhy freeze applications' versions and not update the features? There are several reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*New versions are frequently less stable then older ones. Using a slightly older version ensures it has been well tested.\n\n*One can trust that Ubuntu will not significantly change within a particular version. This is very important e.g. for large companies, that want to be able to rely — if they use Ubuntu 10.04 — on its always working the same way, and its containing the same features all the time.\n\n*\n\n*That also means that Ubuntu 10.04 is always 10.04, as opposed to Windows, where Service Packs change a lot in your system, and you need to take care of them.\n\n\n*Ubuntu developers take special care to provide you with the most stable software \navailable. On Windows it's usually a third party's decision when to release an update. This means some may want you to use the latest version, with new cool features, and others may release features only when they have been tested for a longer time. That means you never really know what's going on with the updates there.\n\n*This makes it easier for Ubuntu developers to manage releases. Ubuntu is released each 6 months, and during that period Ubuntu developers prepare the new version for release, packing it with tons of new features and newer software. They add it only to the version that is currently in development, and not to all supported (older) Ubuntu versions: this requires less work.\n\n*\n\n*For example, if they wanted to update GNOME in 10.04 to version 3, that would mean hundreds of other applications' completely breaking, and would require reorganizing the system.\n\n\n*The updates are provided by Canonical and Ubuntu developers, and not by software's developers, as it's done in Windows. Personally, I trust Ubuntu developers much more than developers of software ABC, and can be sure that the new version provided by Ubuntu will do no (even accidental) harm to my computer.\n\n\nAll of the above are one of the main parts of Ubuntu quality. You get the best quality software and OS, and to balance it out you use not the newest, but just a few months older software.\nAlso, remember that when you update to a newer Ubuntu release, all software is again in the newest version (but stays at it until the next release), so it's not a major issue that the software does not contain the newest features. And as others suggest, you can use PPAs to fetch newer software from other sources, if you need to.\n\nA: In my view there are too many.  I have security only selected and out of the 47 pending, very few seem to be \"security\" issues.  Most are new features.  I like what I have so I don't believe I need new features.  Aren't new features prone to have security risks?\n", "Q: Error \"Media change: please insert disc labeled...\" when installing an application I've tried several times to install radio tray on my fresh ubuntu 11.10 installation but when I run ~$ sudo apt-get install radiotraythe following dialog pops up at the end of the script:\nMedia change: please insert the disc labeled\n 'Ubuntu 11.10 _Oneiric Ocelot_ - Release i386 (20111012)'\nin the drive '/cdrom/' and press enter\n\nI've performed previous installations of this app on another computer using the same repository and all went smooth.

Now I can finally skip using keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: Doug's answer works well.

Can't even end the process in System Monitor.\nI've already performed a logout and didn't kill it, probably a restart will do it. Is there any other way to stop apt-get from running when it's waiting for packages to download? \n\nA: First, get the process id (pid) of the apt-get that is running:\nps ax | grep apt-get\n\nThen kill the process by its pid:\nsudo kill -9 [pid]\n\nOr use htop, it lists your processes and enables you to send a variety of signals.\n\nA: Kill precisely\nFind the process id via System Monitor, htop, grepping through ps, whatever (I prefer pgrep -l, see below). Let's say it is 4536 this time. Then kill it dead:\nkill -9 4536\n\nThe shotgun approach\npkill -9 apt-get\n\nThat will kill dead any processes that somehow match the pattern \"apt-get\". You don't have to look up a process number. This corresponds to these processes:\npgrep -l apt-get\n\nThe -l option changes the output from only process numbers to numbers + name. This is good because you can check yourself before blasting away. Maybe when you run pkill -9 nuke you accidentally kill the process the-only-thing-preventing-nukelear-world-war.\nWtf is -9?\nNormally kill programs like kill and pkill put you in the position of Darth Vader fighting Obi Wan. Vader wants to kill Ben, Ben acknowledges Vader's desire, Ben gracefully accepts death now that his task is done. This is the same as using the -15 option.\nBut sometimes processes don't want to die. Or they'll gladly die, just as soon as they've finished doing this one little thing. But you need them to die now, not when it's convenient for them. So you use the -9 option.\nWhy does it keep hanging?\n\n\n*\n\n*Maybe some other process is interfering. It would probably be something called update, or synaptic, or apt, or anything else along these lines. Kill all of these, one by one, retrying your apt-get command after each kill. Worst case scenario, you kill an important process and have to reboot. Not so bad if you're sitting on the couch with your Ubuntu laptop, sucks if you're remoting to a server across the country.\n\n*Maybe you changed your update sources and apt-get didn't get the memo yet. Run sudo apt-get update. But first make sure there aren't any interfering processes.\nI don't have permission to kill anything :|\nTough beans if you don't own the system. But if you do, use sudo in front of each command, like so: sudo pkill -9 process-i-hate. I intentionally didn't include the sudos for you because you oughtn't kill without thought for your binary victims.\nSources\nman kill\nman grep\nman pkill\nman pgrep\nman ps\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Desktop Installation Partition Sizing Formula I want to reinstall Ubuntu from scratch. \nI have read (here and here) that it is recommended to have 3 partitions for the desktop installation: root, home and swap as having a separate home and root can simplify the process if you want to upgrade or reinstall Ubuntu (if you break something by mistake).\nBut there is no type of formula (that I can find) on how big each partition should be.\nI know this is somewhat dependant on what you plan to install.

I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 on a refurbished machine. I have also replaced a defective NIC card with a new NIC card, two NIC cards are recognized when the install occurs. I also have squid installed as a proxy server. Squid works well when all workstations are connected to the router. However ... .\nWhen I connect one NIC to my router (live internet connection available), the other NIC to my switch (without any internet available), I can create two separate networks, but I can't figure out how to make the two NIC cards transfer data between themselves, as well as, across the two networks.  \n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried to bridge both Ethernet cards ... no luck!  \n\n*I have tried to update iptables ... no luck! \n\n*I have set both NIC cards to static addresses ... no luck! \n\n*I have configured one NIC to use the other as a gateway ... no luck!

You have to change to root with sudo su before (because sudo will run echo 1 as root but will try to redirect to the file as your user and this won't work). Anyways, you allways can check if there is a 1 with cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward. \nObs: this has to be done on every boot so you can write a script and use update-rc.d on it.\nPOSTROUTING rule looks OK if eth0 is your internet connection NIC.\nFORWARD rules I use for established and related connections:\n-A FORWARD -p tcp -m state -d your_network_ip.0/255.255.255.0 --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n-A FORWARD -p udp -m state -d your_network_ip.0/255.255.255.0 --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\n\n2nd UPDATE - Automatic script:\n#!/bin/sh\n# turn ip_forward on/off\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n'start')\n        echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n        ;;\n'stop')\n        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n        ;;\n*)\n        echo \"Usage: $0 { start | stop }\"\n        ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n\nYou save this script in /etc/init.d with the name you want (router for example) and you make it executable (sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/router).\nTo have it run on each reboot you need to make start links with update-rc.d:\nsudo update-rc.d router defaults\n\nOther things you have to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*DHCP working on the 2nd network and sending your machine IP as default gateway to subnet\n\n*default gateway (your machine IP in the new subnet) is better with fixed IP\n\n*you commented you can't ping the 2nd NIC but from where? the subnet, your machine or machines connected directly on the router?\n\n*squid is installed on your machine?

You should now have always a 1 in ip_forward file.\n\nA: I tried this advice and ran into a problem that isn't covered here: the next computer has to know how to get back to the last computer.\nIn my case, I have 2 networks: A WiFi network, 192.168.1.0/24, and an Ethernet network, 192.168.40.0/24.  My \"router\" is a laptop with both a WiFi transceiver on the 192.168.1.0/24 and an Ethernet interface on the 192.168.40.0/24 network.  The household router also has a WiFi transceiver and an Ethernet interface, but this Ethernet transceiver connects to The Internet.  The  household router also has a Network Address Translator (NAT).  The household router has a routing table, and that routing table has a default route entry, which normally points to the Internet Service Providers (ISP's) router.\nWhen a computer on the 192.168.40.0/24 network wished to send a packet to some computer on The Internet, it consulted its own routing table and knew that the default gateway was the laptop, 192.168.40.1.  When the packet arrived at the laptop, it consulted its own routing table and forwarded the packet to the household router.  The household router consulted its routing table, went through Network Address Translation (a detail we can ignore for this discussion), and then to the ISP's router.  At some point, the destination machine will want to send a packet to my computer.  The packet will arrive at the household router, go through reverse NAT, and then have to be routed.  When the packet comes out of NAT, it will have a destination IPv4 address in the 192.168.40.0/24 network. It was at this point that I ran into a problem: the household router didn't know about the Ethernet network, 192.168.40.0/24.  So it did what it's supposed to do - forward that packet to its default router, i.e. the ISP's router.\nTo resolve the problem, I had to make an entry in the household router's routing table, which tells it that to get to any computer in the 192.168.40.0/24 network, send the packet to the laptop's WiFi address, which is in 192.168.1.0/24.  Now, when the packet arrives at the laptop, the laptop knows about the 192.168.40.0/24 network, and routes the packet there.\n", "Q: Default filesystem permissions and access rights in 12.04?

The icon sets are stored in /usr/share/icons. If the icon set in use is for example \"ubuntu-mono-dark\" look in the folder /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark/status. Status is the where the icons you're interested are stored regardless of the icon set you're using. Inside status will be folders for each size that can be used. Modern icons are frequently scale-able with an .svg extension rather than png which are fixed size. If you open a similar icon to the what you plan to create in gimp for png and inkscape for svg you'll be able to see and match the colors of the icon.

I have permament problem when using WLAN with my Lenovo ThinkPad x121e. The wireless network adapter in use is this one:\nlspci:\n\n01:00.0 Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter (rev 01)\n\nThe connection normally works OK for some time and then starts to slow down and eventually disconnects.

I recommend also to run the script \"driver-select\" with the option rtlwifi before compiling because one doesn't need the other drivers and it reduces building time:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential\n\ntar jvxf compat-wireless-3.5.1-1-snpc.tar.bz2\ncd compat-wireless-3.5.1-1-snpc\n./scripts/driver-select rtlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nBut the downside is you have to rebuild the driver after every kernel update. \nI'm running the driver for two days now with excessive closing and opening the lid and didn't get any disconnects. \n\nA: The problem could be caused by channel hopping (and the new Linux kernel).\nI fixed it mostly with compile the driver by my own and install it. 2nd thing I did was to scan for networks if the network is breaking.\nI entered in terminal watch sudo iwlist wlan0 scan.\nWith this the driver kept awake. Another fix I used is to press Fn+F5 to disable wifi and then I do the same a few seconds later.\nOne more thing I tried:\nsudo modprobe -r rtl8192ce\nsudo modprobe rtl8192ce\n\nThis reloads the driver for wifi. I also ping sometimes the router, this keeps my wifi connection stable.\n\nA: This link gave me the hint to try the option ips=0 for the module rtl8192ce to turn off all power saving with the wlan adapter. Up to now this gives me the best behaviour - no drop outs, no disconnects. This surely will have an efect on power consumption - we will see. I'm using the build in drivers with kernel 3.0.0-15 for now.\n\nA: I ended up replacing the WLAN card as I was unable to get a stable connection. \nFor those wanting to do the same: The trick is to plug the card into the spare mini PCIe slot and not the WLAN card slot. This way the BIOS will not complain about unsuproted hardware.  The spare slot is meant for a WWAN/UMTS card, but the WLAN antenna cables reach it just fine. It is really simple to do its just 3 screws for the panel and one for the card, plus the antenna plugs. \nI bought a Intel Centrino Advanced - N 6200 card (half lenght PCIe) for 20€ and it works perfectly. Though I recomend using a full lenght PCI express card as thats what the slot is made for (I had to fix mine with tape, wich is a lot mare stable than it sounds).\n\nA: I did the same: disabled the WLAN port in the BIOS, removed the Realtek card and added a Intel Centrino 6200 to the WWAN port. I used a MiniPCIe adapter half->full (costs less than 5Eur) to secure the card in place.\n\nA: hey i just did what is mentioned in the last part of the text (update feb 21 2011)\nhttp://www.hitxp.com/articles/software/ubuntu-fix-slow-wireless-internet-connection-speed-upgrading-11-04-natty-narwhal/\ni get better results with that for\nthinkpad x121e ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: I was also having the same issue. I went through the process of compiling drivers from source, etc. But I still had the same problem. I would have access but it was extremely slow. I would have to release and reload the module it seems like every 5-10 minutes to keep any usable connection.\nNow this was just annoying. So reading though more posts and testing multiple methods I finally found a solution that worked for me. I did the following.\nFrom a fresh install:\nsudo -i\napt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade\napt-get install linux-packports-modules-cw-3.4-3.2.0-30-generic\nnano /etc/modules (Added rtl8192ce to the end)\n\nChanged ipv6 to ignore in network manager.\nDid a reboot as usual.\nWhen I first login sometimes I have to release the module and reload.\nsudo modprobe -r rtl8192ce\n\n(wait a few seconds)\nsudo modprobe rtl8192ce\n\nI've been testing all night downloading files from my server without any notable reduced speed, or loss of connection. As stated before sometimes I have to release the module and reload. But rarely only on boot.\nI am using kernel version 3.2.0-30-generic, and the wlan card is the ASUS PCE-N15. I also use opendns server's don't think it makes a difference too much, but I prefer to use them.\nI hope this helps anyone that was having the same problem. I know I was so close to going back to windows, but I had to try.\n\nA: Teach a man how to fish:\nI had exactly the same problem: new ASUS 802-11bgn wireless card with a ralink rtl8192ce chipset, WiFi connection used to drop and then re-establish itself every few minutes.  ssh sessions and web page loading would freeze and everything was painfully slow but intermittently \"working\".\nOver the course of several days, I tried many solutions, both on the software and hardware side: upgrading drivers, reorienting antenna, moving the wireless card to a further slot to avoid heat from the neighbor graphics card, reconfiguring the WiFi access point to use different channels, try narrower frequency bands to reduce interference from neighbors, changing MTU, disabling power-saving, etc. etc.  Trial and error at its extreme.\nThe breakthrough in my case, came when I realized 2 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*My wireless signal is actually strong and healthy.  This was found by using:\nwatch iwlist wlan0 scan\n\n*Before any disconnection occurred, there's was serious packet loss issue.  This was found by continuously running mtr in a dedicated window:\nmtr 10.0.0.1\n(replace 10.0.0.1 with your actual access point IP). Running this mtr in one screen allowed me to quickly verify if any change I make, has an immediate effect on packet-loss.  The ability to perform this quick experimentation was key to pin-point the culprit among so many possible variables.\nIn my case, it was the repeater (aka \"WiFi extender\") in the hallway. Once turned off, packet loss started dropping towards 0%. YMMV.  As it turns out, 802-11n has the ability to integrate multiple weak signals bouncing off walls at slight delays to amplify the signal.  In my case, I figured the repeater was introducing a too big delay causing almost exactly one in 3 packets to be received in error.\nAs you can see from the large number of answers here, many people have a similar problem, but the reasons are different. The key to any eventual solution may be simply the ability to quickly experiment and test hypotheses.  A continuous mtr monitoring the packet-loss rate while changing parameters at the same time did it for me.  I highly recommend this as a diagnostic approach.\n\nA: I do own a X121e too. I have switched my WLAN to g-mode only. Now my Wlan connection is quite stable (working for about 1 hour without disconnect). Maybe the switch between b-mode, g-mode and, n-mode is part of the problem.\n\nA: Update for Ubuntu 12.04: \nI have the same problem as before with the buildin driver of Precise Pangolin. What is working more stable than anything I tried with Oneiric is the driver from realtek's website. I'm using the latest version (0005.1230.2011). This version did not work well for me with Oneiric (suspend did not work). With Precise it work's fine and the problems are mostly gone. From time to time (once every two days maybe) the wireless connection stops working as before, but not nearly as often as before. \n\nA: I have the same issues with X121e. I have the problem that the function keys were swaped after standby and the wireless randomly disconnects.\nThen my mainboard was broken and I sent the notebook back to lenovo which replaced the mainboard. And after that everything worked fine. All my problems were gone! Until I reinstalled Kubuntu and all the problems are back.\nMaybe this helps more to understand\n", "Q: How do I test for TrueCrypt?

This might be an ignorant question, but I tried Kubuntu recently. I've heard that it merely has a different interface, but the backend is essentially Ubuntu.\nYet, when I installed it, my sound didn't work properly and it didn't ask me to install the Nvidia drivers.\nInstalling Ubuntu, however, was a breeze. Everything works and the Software Updater tells me what to install.\nIs Kubuntu's backend different to Ubuntu's?\n\nA: Fewer developers work on the Kubuntu desktop than on the Ubuntu desktop, so sometimes polish such as \"make it automatically open the hardware drivers window if needed\" doesn't get done for both. The ability to install those drivers by opening the tool through the menu is still there.\nAs to sound, KDE has an additional sound layer on top of the Pulse Audio that Ubuntu and Kubuntu both include.

I have a laptop which has a Intel 852GME chipset.  I had an older laptop, I can't remember which chipset that has, but simply by doing a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.04, I was able to connect another monitor to the laptop via the vga port, and I would end up with a desktop spanning 2 screens, the laptop screen and the second screen, giving me a large desktop.\nThis other laptop which has the Intel 852GME chipset, that doesn't happen.  I can't even manually select another screen from the monitors dialog box.\nWhy is this and how do I enable the second monitor?  At the moment, I am getting a mirror image of the laptop screen on the second screen.\n\nA: Your best bet would be to use xrandr for customizing your multimonitor setup. First just type this at the command line\nxrandr\n\nLook at the output how your laptop screen and the external screen is named. My laptop screen was named LVDS and external was named CRT1. Could be different for you.\nFirst you can change the resolution of each monitor with:\nxrandr --output CRT1 --mode 1920x1080\n\nThen you can set the primary display (the one that will have the gnome panel) with:\nxrandr --output CRT1 --primary\n\nIf xrandr complains about the desktop not being large enough, put a Virtual info in your xorg.xconf file, such as:\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier \"amdcccle-Screen[1]-0\"\nDevice     \"amdcccle-Device[1]-0\"\nDefaultDepth     24\nSubSection \"Display\"\n    Viewport   0 0\n    Virtual   3360 1920\n    Depth     24\nEndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nOnly the SubSection \"Display\" with the Virtual line should be added, the rest is specific for my setup.

Are there any compatibility issues? Should I be using an older version of Ubuntu, if yes which version? Please help.\n\nA: Unity uses a lot of CPU resources.  You may look to a method of removing Unity and using gnome.  Of course, if you remove a lot of the defaults of the distro you might lose some support for other functions that might be associated with the distro.\nI understand a lot of public sentiment that lots of wasteful resources are built into the various OS' each day.  The developers try to make things convenient for the users and add features.  These features take up CPU cycles.  That's why XP was slower than Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.1 was slower than DOS.  Each generation required more resources from the computer.  If Windows XP could run on one of the earlier computers (a 286 for example) because of the CPU cycles, it would probably take nearly a year for it to boot up.  It would probably also take a week for a mouse movement position to be updated.\nPlease consider that hard drive space of a new computer is measured in 100's of gigs rather than 100's of megs as when XP was release.  Of course when DOS first came out the hard drive sizes were measured in Mbs (not 10's of Mbs).  Thge first hard drive I bought was actully 2 megs for two dollars.\nThe CPU speed of the computers running DOS were less than 1MHz.  The CPU speeds of computers today is measured in GHz... still in the single digits, but imagine what the applications will be doing when the hard drive space and speed is 1000 times what they are today and the CPU's are measured in triple digits of GHz.  The developers will add even more functionality that will take even more cycles.\nI believe the best suggestion for you is to look for a Linux distribution that requires less resources and has less default functionality, or get a higher performance computer, or deal with the slower operation.\nAs computers develop in performance, the developers are going to put the CPU cycles to use... not only the developer for the OS, but the developers of each of the application that you load to the computer.\nI understand my answer might not be the best and the most direct answer, but hopefully it might ease some of your aggravation and get you quicker to the resolution of changing distros if Ubuntu isn't for you.  Looking for an older version might cause you to lose support from the developers.\nBut you can always pick the oldest version of Ubuntu that is currently supported.  The performance would most likely be higher, because it'll actually do less in the background.\n\nA: Use Xubuntu or Lubuntu. They will eat less memory, and use less cpu. The ubuntu applications are there in the repository, so you can install them at any time.\n\nA: The minimum hardware requirements for Windows XP Home Edition are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pentium 233-megahertz (MHz) processor or faster (300 MHz is recommended)\n\n*At least 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM (128 MB is recommended)\n\n\nSource\n\nThe minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu 12.04 is 384 MB of memory for Ubuntu Desktop. Note that some of your system's memory may be unavailable due to being used by the graphics card. If your computer has only the minimum amount of memory, the installation process will take longer than normal.\nSource\nBut Ubuntu does not perform well with the very low minimum specifications they say will work with less than 1GB of RAM.\nThe minimum requirements alone already answer your question. I have both installed on a old computer (dual boot - clean install). Windows XP is much faster.\n\nA: If the UI is sluggish, then it could be that your computer isn't fast enough or there are problems with drivers. If programs load slowly, then that means that you should get a faster hard drive. Also keep in mind that Ubuntu 11.10 uses considerably more resources than Windows XP because of the visual effects and the fact that Windows XP was designed many years before Ubuntu 11.10 for much slower computers.\n\nA: use xubuntu if ur very much concerned about the speed , otherwise gnome shell is quite fast , also ubuntu 11.10 is comparable to win 7 or win 8 not with xp also the security and features in xp  do not match with the advanced ubuntu 11.10 , so for the features and the look u will have to sacrifice something , also u can use preload to get some speed also remove unwanted programs....sorry for my poor english.\nsudo apt-get install preload or u can install from synaptic too\n", "Q: I can not recover files from trash I accidentally deleted some large files (10gb which is associated with Truecrypt) but I didnt empty the trash.

But I didn't empty it. When I delete other files they disappear but they don't show inside the trash bin.\n\nA: I had the same problem and roadmr's solution didn't work for me either. Then I realized that my files were from USB. When you delete the files on some other media (e.g. USB) it does NOT go to .local/share/Trash but it goes to .Trash* directory on that device.\nFor example, my USB was mounted on /media/DA6B-3E12 and the files were on:\n/media/DA6B-3E12/.Trash-1000/files.\nYou can now use the mv command to restore them.\nmv /media/DA6B-3E12/.Trash-1000/files/your_song.mp3 ~/Desktop\n\n\nA: Normally you'd left-click on the trashcan icon, select the file you want to restore, and click on 'Restore selected items'. \nIf that's not working for you, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (ctrl-alt-t) Type this to go to the trash directory:\ncd .local/share/Trash/files\n\n\n*To see the files in the trash directory type:\nls\n\n\n*If  you see the file you need to restore, use the mv command to move it elsewhere in the filesystem:\nmv my-large-file.tc ~/Desktop\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If the file has a strange name you can use quotes around it, like this:\nmv \"1940's hits (rock)\" ~/Desktop\n\nAlternatively, type mv, then the first characters of the filename (for example, 1940), then press the TAB key to get filename autocompletion, which will take care of adding necessary quoting automatically. If the generated filename has characters like \\, it's OK, those are for quoting special characters.\n\nA: I had a slightly different problem - the deleted folder was shown in trash but clicking restore just caused the window to hang with the restore button still visible and not greyed out. After about 30 seconds a dialog appeared saying \"files is not responding\".\nI left it a few minutes and still nothing happened so eventually I just killed the process and restarted it.

Here, after installation I noticed that when you click the same network icon in the \"taskbar\" sort of thing, the section for \"wired network\" itself is missing.

I tried to install restricted extras (am I using it right?) through terminal, but it seems I failed :) maybe because during installation the internet connection crashed... anyway, I restarted and I got the Ubuntu intro screen at the boot, and then a black screen appeared with this information: \nchecking battery state\n\nI restarted and it showed something else, so I rebooted for 5 times. Then a screen appeared \n*starting bluetooth \n*pulseaudio configured for per-user sessions saned disabled; edit /etc/default/saned\n\nI tried this: My fresh installation doesn't load. (PulseAudio problem) but didn't know how to save so I just skipped to update-grub, anyway nothing helped. What do I do?\n\nA: As you have mentioned, when installing the connection got cut out and created a chain of problems afterwards. The solution is to do the installation again without having any problems while doing it (Power going down, hard drive in flames, etc..). But just to say it, if you start installing any OS and it fails while installing it at some point, you will probably have a corrupted system. Installing it again is your best bet.\nAlso while selecting to install the 3rd party restricted stuff make sure the internet does not go offline with you.\n", "Q: Battery indicator disappears and shows frequently I have a problem with a battery (power) indicator in Ubuntu 11.10 with Gnome Shell.

I have installed ubuntu 11.10 to my dell notebook. I am very satisfied so far. how many years will it be supported from ubuntu. or should I install long term support version?\n\nA: Non LTS versions of Ubuntu are supported for 18 months from release, so 11.10 will be supported until April 2013. See the ubuntu releases page for details of the different releases and their support periods.\nIf you were to install the current LTS, 10.04, then desktop support for that release would also end in April 2013, so that doesn't help. Though 10.04 is likely to be that much more stable at this point as there has been longer to debug it.\nThe next LTS will be released in April 2012 and will be supported for 5 years on the desktop.\nOverall my advice to you would be to stick with 11.10 for now, and once 12.04 LTS has been released upgrade to that. The last few upgrades have been very reliable and simple for me. After the upgrade you can stick with 12.04 for up to five years and still get updates.\n\nA: Until April 2013, so in total one year and a half.\nHere is a table with all the support periods.\n", "Q: Term, Xterm or Uxterm? I'm an average home user, but still sometimes use terminal for simple tasks. When I type \"terminal\" in unity, it offers me three choices - but what`s the difference? I hate always choosing randomly and thinking about what I did.\n\nA: The default is \"terminal\", which is gnome-terminal.\nYou can also summon one with a hotkey ctrl-alt-T\n\nA: Gnome-terminal is generally more of a resource hog than xterm and rxvt.\nAlso, gnome-terminal's install size is generally around ten times larger than\nxterm's.\nBy default, urxvt uses a feature called fast scrolling. This causes the\nterminal emulator to not always update the window when the content changes. If\na program is outputting a significant amount of data to the terminal emulator,\nfast scrolling can result in a noticeable performance boost. Xterm has this\noption disabled by default, but you can enable it by putting XTerm*fastScroll:\nTrue in your .Xresources file. Gnome-terminal does not seem to have this\nfeature.\nGnome-terminal has profiles that allow you to define and quickly switch between\nconfigurations.\n\nA: Terminal is, in Ubuntu default software, the gnome-terminal. XTerm is... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm. UXTerm is XTerm with support to Unicode characters.\nThe main difference between XTerm and Terminal is that the gnome-terminal has more features, while XTerm is minimalistic (though it has features that are't in gnome-terminal, but they are more advanced).\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu, you should also have gnome-terminal installed. For Kubuntu the default terminal is konsole, and for Lubuntu is lxterminal.\nAll three are good choices.\nTo be Desktop Environment independent as much as possible, I would choose  lxterminal. \nxterm, and uxterm are good but they use ugly looking fonts, and pose some problems in regards to keystrokes (see How do I set up hotkeys for a xterm?).\n\nA: For an average user, xterm and uxterm are pretty useless. \nI personally rely on gnome-terminal even for advanced usage. I simply remove the other two, so I don't be bothered with them showing in my apps search. \n", "Q: DVI+HDMI out, at startup only HDMI is available I have my computer next to my hdtv.

I am not even sure whether Ubuntu already has the required drivers but if it does why are the graphics so rusty, and if not why am I unable to install the drivers provided by intel? Please help.\nThis is the link from where I downloaded the drivers. Here.\n\nA: Are you talking about screen resolution? Icon size? Background image positioning?\nThose should be configurable, you should check on your display settings and appearance as well. Look for them on your System menu.\nThe Intel graphic driver is already installed, so it is not really the problem.\n\nA: I notice that you are using the Lucid Linyx 10.04 LTS release of Ubuntu.\nThe newer releases are in general, a lot prettier than this release.\nOther than that, is your issue with the scaling of your wallpaper? Or something else? Is it just because the screen sizes and aspect ratios of these screenshots are different? Are you looking at the two OSs on different screens (with different quality)?\nIf it's fonts, you may want to configure the anti-aliasing (the font config panel was still available in this release).\n(On Windows, your wallpaper looks much worse, to my eye, because it has been stretched out of it's normal aspect ratio)\n", "Q: Recommendations for small stocks indicator?

Many of the wireless printservers available from Linksys require Windows-only drivers to be installed on computers that will use the printserver. What are some printservers that are compatible with Ubuntu, and how much do they cost?\n\nA: Most (if not all) of the HP printers work using HPLIP without installing anything else.\nThey also can be shared without any additional software (at least to linux machines). You can use CUPS too or samba to share for windows machines.\nPS: all software needed have 0 cost\nUPDATE:\nIn Ubuntu you don't need additional drivers for the print server or router sharing a printer or to connect directly to a wifi printer only the printer driver (that is already included in HPLIP in Ubuntu).

I have been working with Ubuntu version 11.04 and I have noticed that it is a lot slower than xp. Like, windows take more time to open. Processes take more time to complete. Even surfing the net is slower. I did some research and found out that an older version might be better than this version. Also, if other linux distributions would be faster and better for my machine, please tell me which ones/ I am giving my system specs-\nchipset - Intel Brookdale-G i845GEV\nmotherboard - 01/25/2005-i845G-W627-6A69VM4YC-00\nvideo adapter - Intel(R) 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics Controller\n\nA: I answered a similar question here with regards to the i845 and unity/unity 2D.\nThe OP himself confirmed that Lubuntu was the recommended distro for your graphics type.\nYou should note, the chief reason for this is that intel have dropped support for the i8xx series of graphics chipset.  The support is legacy only with mainly stability fixes.  Thus the more newer interfaces such as Unity will not work correctly (no 3D acceleration).\nLubuntu has moved on for the better in v11.10 - I would warmly recommend you try this newer version rather than the slightly older Natty version of Lubuntu.\n", "Q: Wireless firmware missing!

I would however recommend installing the package build-essential, it will install some more useful packages.\ng++ can be invoked on the command-line like this: g++ source.cpp -o myprogram\nLater when your programs will get more functions you will probably need some extra libraries. You can find them most easily via apt-cache search.

Hey just wondering if Ubuntu had some great software designed to take notes in school?\nFeatures: Maybe categorize by subject or course #? and Like Keywords or Section titles?\nI am aware I can use LibreWord and do Headers for each section and save them to individual folders but seems like Ubuntu might have something better for school.\n\nA: I quite like FreeMind for taking notes - it's a mind map application.\nYou can create bubbles for each topic, and put detailed notes in each, decorate the bubbles with icons, and break large clusters out into their own linked files.\nFreeMind is written in Java and will work on Windows and OSX as well.\nFor more prosaic note taking I often find myself using a TiddlyWiki - this isn't an Ubuntu app per-se, it's just an HTML page with some clever JavaScript embedded in it. You can take notes and link between topics easily, much like Tomboy. I have an empty TiddlyWiki in my templates directory so that I can create a new one with a right-mouse click any time.\nBoth these approaches work well on any major operating system - and TiddlyWiki doesn't even need you to install anything.\n\nA: I would recommend Zim, for the sake of brevity, i will not bother to go into details here, instead see the answer I provided to this question\n\nA: Well Ubuntu comes preinstalled with Tomboy notes which could be used for this purpose.

With it you can take notes and take advantage of the normal Emacs commands as well as special features for note taking such as short cuts to make new headings that can be collapsed so that you can overview your notes. You can also make and convert lists, it supports input of advanced maths via LaTeX and you can also export your notes to other formats such as HTML and PDF. Finally you can also tag your notes, such as the subject, and make link between notes (even to particular lines in notes).\nIt takes a little bit more time to learn Org-mode than Tomboy or Gnote and you need get familiar with Emacs as a whole but after you have learnt it you will found it powerful and efficient.\nTo install it:\nsudo apt-get install org-mode org-mode\n\n", "Q: The slide show is not working in LibreOffice  When I create a presentation in LibreOffice and click the button for slide show, nothing happens, the screen gets sort of freezed, its frustating.\nBesides, image viewer also works no more.\n\nA: Actually problem was a bit complex.

As a result, if you try to configure such a port forwarding, the VM will refuse to start.\n\n\nI guess this is the reason for getting port 80 forwarded properly when the host was run as a root user. Anyway I am not sure why the port is changing automatically from 80 to 1080.\n\nA: I'm able to forward the ports by running VirtualBox as root.

As can be seen from the the linked image below the problem is that in some games (namely Aquaria and Myth II Soulblighter native client) all 2D textures inside OpenGL (3D) have visible edges around them, making typically bunch of rectangles that should not be seen otherwise (or are not seen on other video cards). this is the case apparently with all textures, both those that should be transparent (e.g. have something only in the middle but nothing around the edges) and non-transparent. I am wondering if this is a bug, or a setting issue that I can somehow fix.\nSince only some apps are affected by this, mainly an indie game (Aquaria) and an older game (Myth II), I am wondering if they use some older and possibly less common OpenGL function for displaying 2D textures inside 3D (OpenGL) context and for which current Intel driver simply does not do proper texture aliasing around the edges of the texture, resulting in the said lines...\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/Rvudm.jpg\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/YzlAm.jpg\nP.S. Forgot to mention, this is on a new HP dm1-4050 which I is a sandy bridge chipset with an integrated Intel HD 3000 inside it. The system is running Oneiric with latest updates including the latest ppa intel xorg driver (but not including any new changes to Xorg or mesa). The problem is apparent in 2 3D games, Aquaria and Myth II Soulblighter, both of which are using 32-bit libs (they are 32-bit games) on a 64-bit system.\nUPDATE: After corresponding with the Aquaria developer, he suggested there might be a problem with 32-bit builds of the libGL* libs for the 64-bit system (which is what I am using), since both games are 32-bit apps, and so far they are the only ones to exhibit this problem... I am waiting for the Aquaria dev to supply a test release for the 64-bit systems to see if the problem will go away and if it does then, this is definitely the problem with 32-bit builds of supporting libs. If so, how could I proceed to fix this?\nUPDATE 2: I just tested the 64-bit version of Aquaria and the artifacts are gone, so this is definitely problem with ia32-libs and how they provide mesa/GL libs (I am not sure whether it is an issue of version or the way they are built or something entirely different). I informed the upstream maintainers of ia32-libs but have no idea where the problem lies...\nUPDATE 3: I tried Ubuntu 32-bit via live CD and the same problem persists suggesting that on any version of OS 32-bit mesa GL/GLU libs + Intel HD 3000 combo exhibit this problem but the same is absent on a 64-bit version...\nWhat would be really helpful is if others who run 32-bit version of the OS and use Intel HD 3000 video card could please test the Myth II demo downloadable from the following link: tain.totalcodex.net/items/show/myth-ii-demo-linux and report whether they have any issues as well as what chipset they are using (e.g Sandy Bridge is the one my laptop uses).\nAs a pointer, here's the .h file from Aquaria with all OpenGL calls that might shed light as to where the problem might lie:\nhg.icculus.org/icculus/aquaria/file/tip/BBGE/OpenGLStubs.h (my reputation limit disallows use of more than 2 links, so this one has to be entered manually into the browser)\n\nA: Sandy Bridge support has improved throughout 2011, even after the release of Oneiric.

Is it possible to see what version of jetty will be installed on the various versions of Ubuntu?\nIs it online somewhere?\nAlso, is it possible to see the package so I can tweak it if required?\n\nA: To see what version(s) of Jetty are available for installation on your system:\napt-cache policy jetty\n\nThis lists the installed version (if any) and all the versions available for installation, and indicates which one would be installed by default.\nIf you want to know about other Ubuntu release, look on packages.ubuntu.com.\nIf you want to see the package before installation, download it but don't install it yet:\napt-get -d install jetty\n\nThe package is in /var/lib/apt/cache/jetty*.deb.\n\nA: packages.ubuntu.com can be searched to see which version are included with each release.  Some packages from future releases are fairly easy to install on an older Ubuntu release.  Jetty is likely one of them.\nYou can download the source packages from the above site.  However, I would recommend against tweaking the package.  It is relatively easy to do, but you won't get important security patches.  \nA note about package versions.  These are the original versions.  Security patches are backported to this release, and the available package is updated.  These patches are applied when you update the package.  If you use one of the automatic update packages, they may be applied automatically depending on your settings.\nDebian/Ubuntu makes it quite easy to adapt the configuration to your needs.  For packages that support conf.d configuration, I would recommend using it rather than modifying the original configuration.  This will make version updates much simpler. \n\nA: There are a couple of ways to do this, here is the way that I usually use. Depending on the version of ubuntu you're currently running, you might need to install aptitude. You can do that by opening a terminal and typing the following: \nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nOnce aptitude is installed then you would type the following to determine the version that would be installed or is installed depending. \nsudo aptitude show jetty\n\nHope this helps!\nChris\n\nA: Instead of installing aptitude, it is faster to use apt-cache :\n\napt-cache showpkg jetty\n\nThis command will show full informations about the packet, even if it is not installed.\n\nA: if you do not want to use aptitude, you can use apt instead :\napt search jetty | grep jetty\n\nthe result is \nlibjetty8-extra-java/xenial,xenial,now 8.1.19-1 all  [installé, automatique]\nlibjetty8-java/xenial,xenial,now 8.1.19-1 all  [installé, automatique]\nlibjetty8-java-doc/xenial,xenial 8.1.19-1 all\nlibjetty9-extra-java/xenial,xenial 9.2.14-1 all\nlibjetty9-java/xenial,xenial 9.2.14-1 all\n\nconsequently you have the choice betweel jetty8 and jetty9\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu need 2 swap partitions, can I remove one?

I've found that most of user authentication programs that used in Ubuntu is not gksu, but it's not a problem. The problem is that these programs do not lock the keyboard (while gksu does).\nFor example, the program xneur (analog puntoswitcher) can log keystrokes. And when I turn on this option, I found my password used to authenticate applications in this log.\nWhy is Ubuntu using such an insecure method of authentication? Is there a specific reason why applications don't use gksu to authenticate? If so, why, if not, shouldn't measures be taken to ensure that applications use gksu to authenticate?\n\nA: sudo provides access to commands. If you have access to the shutdown command, then you can always shutdown the system. PolicyKit provides access to features. For instance, you can say that a user is allowed to reboot the system, but only if there's no other logged in users. PolicyKit rules can be made for almost anything you can do in your system. For instance, it might be beneficial to say that anyone in the family should be allowed to install officially released security updates from the official repositories, but not install any new software. That's far beyond the scope of sudo; if you have access to apt-get, then you have access to apt-get. There's no granularity. \nHowever, why the PolicyKit dialog doesn't grab the inputs, I don't know.

This arguably is a major security concern, but still maybe ok for listening to *.ogg *.mp3 in rare occasions.\nAlso it would be smart to check for a safer substitution to the xhost + command to allow the x-server access in a more restricted manner.\nThe mehtod of using two/multiple user accounts can be a workaround to the limitation of only one instance per user. maybe a smart person can even create a kind of sandboxing \"on-the-fly-user-creation\" script which will call a totem instance.

There's a menu item that says \"Banshee\". That will bring Banshee up.\nThe answer to this question explains why Banshee works this way (i.e. it continues playing music even after you've \"closed\" it.\nIf what you want is to entirely quit Banshee, the question I linked to before has the answer (To quit Banshee, you must first pause the music.).\n", "Q: How to change menu system and appearance, please? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat different desktop environments and shells are available? \n\n11.10 graphic menus, is there a way for users that came from 11.04 to enable classic gnome menu?  Also how do I change colors of application backgrounds, menu items etc, I would like to tweak around with colors and configurations.\n\nA: You have a few options.\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll probably want to make sure Alacarte (Gnome's menu editor) and the Advanced Settings utility are installed. If it's not, run sudo apt-get install alacarte gnome-tweak-tool\n\n*For a classic menu in Unity: You could install the Menu Indicator. It can be installed via a PPA in Ubuntu 11.10. Run sudo apt-add-repository ppa:diesch/testing, then sudo apt-get update, and finally sudo apt-get install classicmenu-indicator. Then launch it (from Unity Dash) or simply log out and in again.\n\n*For configuring colors in Unity: You could upgrade Unity to its latest version from a PPA. I can't guarantee stability, but it seems that Ubuntu hopes to offer more tweaking to Unity (including colors) to users. To do this, run sudo add-apt-repository ppa:unity-team/staging, then run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n*For configuring colors in general: Now that you have access to advanced settings, why not try some different Gnome3 themes? They ship with different colors. If you insist on sticking to the default theme (Ambiance) yet want to change the colors, run gksudo gedit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc, then change the value of selected_bg_color (default is orange, you'll have to find the HTML color code for the color you want), save and exit, changes will kick in eventually (I believe logging out and in should do the trick).\n\n*Consider not using Unity. The nice thing about Linux is that it offers choice, letting users of all proficiency in Linux find a desktop where they feel at home. You could use Gnome Shell, there's a Gnome Shell extension that's a little similar to the Menu Indicator for Unity. You could use Gnome Classic. Granted you'd probably want to tweak Gnome Classic a little if you're considering using it, but it'll give you the traditional applications menu.\n\n\nA: You may wish to give GNOME Classic a look.

I know I can install Samba or openssh-server to be able to share files between two Ubuntu computers. Is there a way to share files without installing additional packages?\nI installed Ubuntu on two systems on the same LAN, but without Internet connectivity. I found that my usual way of transferring files (scp) failed because openssh-server was not installed on either system. Using Personal File Sharing was impossible without installing extra packages. I ended up using netcat to transfer, which is suboptimal and not intuitive for the average user.\nSo I'd like to know if anyone knows of a way to do this with out-of-the-box Ubuntu installations (or at least, with packages available in the Ubuntu desktop CD).\nThanks!\n\nA: You can move to a given directory with cd, then serve the current directory as a web server with the command:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nOn the other machine go to the address http://server-ip:8000/\nwhere \"server-ip\" is what you see when you do \"ifconfig\" on the source computer, under \"inet addr:\". For example, if the output of ifconfig on the source computer starts like this:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:30:67:d5:a7:a4  \n          inet addr:10.0.0.3  Bcast:10.0.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          ...\n\nthen on the target computer, you should point the browser to:\n http://10.0.0.3:8000/\n\n\nA: if you want something faster that python's SimpleHTTPServer module (which is awesome and is most simple way imho), you can use netcat (nc utility) - it's using raw TCP so you won't be having overhead that comes with HTTP protocol.\nFor example if you are trying to copy file config.xml from host germany.local to host france.local (both running ubuntu), you need to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*on target host france.local run: \nnc -l -p 7000 > copied_config.xml\n\n(it will start nc process that listens on the port 7000 for incoming data and writes said data to file copied_config.xml)\n\n*on source host germany.local run:\nnc -q 0 france.local 7000 < config.xml\n\nThat's all!\nAlso, you can check this helpful howto for more in depth instructions\n", "Q: Broadcom BCM4313 works poorly on a HP Pavilion G4-1212TU I just bought a HP Pavilion G4-1212TU laptop and put Ubuntu 11.10 on it.

On the server hosting the database I can type:\nmysql -u _username_ -p\n\nto connect. \nI would like to be able to type:\nmysql -h _host_ -u _username_ -p\n\nto connect from another server. I don't have MySQL installed on the client so the command is not found. Is there something I can install (apt-get preferred) besides the entire MySQL-server so I can use the mysql commands in bash?\n\nA: To install the command line MySQL client you should do:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-client\n\nand then you can do\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT_NUMBER -u USERNAME -p\n\nHowever you may need to alter the set up of the MySQL server. By default on ubuntu the MySQL server will only accept connections from the local server. The setting is called bind-address and is set in /etc/mysql/my.cnf. By default it is 127.0.0.1 - you should change it to the IP address of the server. If the server has multiple IP addresses you can choose just one IP address (say for the internal network) or have MySQL listen to all IP addresses by making the value 0.0.0.0\nYou will also need to ensure that the MySQL user can access the database. Following instructions on the internet, you may have created user 'myname'@'localhost' - that user will not be able to connect remotely. To create a new user who can connect from your client IP address you need to do something like:\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name TO 'username'@'192.168.0.51' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n\nRead a little more about the address specification MySQL uses.\nFinally don't forget to ensure that the server firewall will allow access to the MySQL port - the default is 3306.\n", "Q: How do I increase the  touchpad sensitivity on Acer Aspire One 532h? I got a cheap netbook and put ubuntu on it without even booting into the windows it came with.

The swap partition is also on the RAID. My home directory is encrypted, the swap partition,too.\nNow I have bought a SSD disk and would like to move the system files there for quicker startup and loading of applications.\nI imagine the following procedure:\n1. create a normal bootable partition and a swap partition on the SSD. Move the swap to the SSD (I have found instructions on that).\n2. Boot with a live CD and move all the system files to the SSD.\n3. move the home directory stuff up one directory level and add it to /etc/fstab so that the RAID is mounted as /home/\nWhile all of that seems rather simple, I have to assume that I am unaware of a lot more problems that will come up.\nIs this procedure the way to go?\nOne thing I am especially wondering about is the grub 2 configuration. Will it boot if I just move the files?\nFurthermore, will the encrypted home directory be mounted correctly?\nMy alternative idea would be to move all home data to an external hard disk so that the RAID partition can be reduced to a size which fits on the SSD. Then I could copy essentially the whole system, move the home partition out again and copy the files back. However, this would require a lot of moving files via unencrypted devices, consuming time and making the whole encryption pointless.\nI would appreciate a lot if somebody could give me some advice.\nThank you very much!\n\nA: Yes, i'm been doing this for many times:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all the files\n\n*Correct /etc/fstab ( Especially the one for / )\n\n*Re-generate ramdisk with update-initramfs\n\n*launch update-grub ( you may have to do this in chroot )\n\n\nBut before any operation took place , i strongly suggest you to have a bootable CD or USB for system recovery. e.g fix grub2 with chroot\nAs long as the partition is correctly mounted , everything will be fine.

I'd like to create a virtual machine with VirtualBox and use it on different computers. The problem is that I need to work on my programming projects on different machines and syncing them over the internet is getting increasingly uncomfortable.\nCan I create a portable virtual machine and use it across several hosts? What if the host CPU architectures are different (32-bit vs 64-bit)?\n\nA: Export VM\nWith Virtual Box you can easily export, import or even clone your VMs to any place. This means, that once you export your VM to an external storage device you will be able to import this machine to any other instance of Virtual Box (of course irrespective of host OS).\nDoing so is likely to be not so comfortable as you will have to export/import your machine everytime you made changes on the files hosted on your virtual drive. Depending on this drive size it may also take up quite some time to copy these data.\nDefine working directory on external drive\nTherefore I suggest you set up Virtual Box to use a directory on the external drive as a standard location. In Virtual Box Manager open File - Preferences -General to define a \"Default Machine Folder\" than can also be on a (mounted) external drive.\n\nImport VM\nThen you also need to put your (previously exported) virtual hard disk there. Choose  this location for the individual machine hard disk:\n\nCarry your virtual machine to any place\nYou will now have a set up that not only stores the virtual disk drive but also the Virtual Box working directory for e.g. settings, snapshots etc. on the external drive.\nVirtual Box is capable of running a 64-bit guest OS on a 32-bit host but this may not be as stable as when we stay within our architecture. You may need to test this first.\n\nA: Why don't you install a good environment on a memory stick and boot that? If you say more about your issues, it's easier to provide good ideas. \n\nA: Personally I would use portable virtualbox\nhttp://www.vbox.me/\n", "Q: On-the-fly file search in gnome 3? I recently switched to Gnome 3 (on Onereic 11.10). I was a big fan of gnome-do (on Gnome 2), where I heavily used the \"files and folders\"-plugin. This allows to configure a list of files and folder to be searched on-the-fly while typing. E.g. starting to type \"timesheet\" opens \"timesheet_2011.ods\" from my dropbox account...\nI can't find anything like this in Gnome 3. I know that there is a list of \"recent items\", and also the name of bookmarked folders in nautilus is searched, but that's not (exactly) what I'm looking for...\nSo, what I want is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*tell Gnome 3 where my files are (certainly not only in my home\nfolder)\n\n*have them searched on the fly while I'm typing\n\n\nI think Unity offers something like this - but hey, I'm using Gnome 3 ;-)\nAnything I missed?\n\nA: Actually, there is something like this with zeitgeist, but the project is far from ready and, as you pointed out, it only searches your history.  It might be interesting to make an extension for the gnome shell that uses '/usr/bin/locate' in combination with a list of extensions a user might search for.  I'm not really sure how the API works...\n\nA: To answer my own question after some deeper research:\nNo, there is nothing I missed. You cannot configure gnome 3 to search files and folders. \"Recently used items\" is a help, also \"Bookmarked folders\". But nothing like gnome-do exists. Yet. Hopefully.\n\nA: Debian package zeitgeist-extension-fts description:\n\nfull text search extension for the Zeitgeist engine \n\n\nA: There is a gnome extension, it looks like it works:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/284/tracker-search/\n", "Q: Incompatible libraries when trying to compile a program I wrote I'm not a native speaker, but I will try my best in English.\nFor a self-made program I need some libraries (which are from someone else).

The downside is that my encrypted home partition is completely accessible after resume without entering the passphrase. A bad idea if someome steals your notebook...\nLooking at cryptsetup's manpage. I've learned that LUKS now supports the luksSuspend and luksResume command. Has luksSuspend and luksResume been integrated in the scripts doing suspend-to-RAM and resume?\n\nA: Current problem\nWhen using Ubuntu Full Disk Encryption(that is based on dm-crypt with LUKS) to set up full system encryption, the encryption key is kept in memory when suspending the system. This drawback defeats the purpose of encryption if you carry around your suspended laptop a lot. One can use the cryptsetup luksSuspend command to freeze all I/O and flush the key from memory.\nSolution\nubuntu-luks-suspend  is an attempt to change the default suspend mechanism. The basic idea is to change to a chroot outside of the encrypted root fs and then lock it (withcryptsetup luksSuspend)\n\nA: here is another example of ubuntu 14.04 cryptsetup luks suspend/resume root partition \"almost works\" :-)\none reason it works for arch and \"almost works\" for ubuntu could be that ubuntu kernel as of \n  Linux system 3.19.0-25-generic #26~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 24 21:16:20 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nis still \"too old\": the following patch is not there yet: \nmake sync() on suspend-to-RAM optional\nso any pm-utils or user code that issues any form of\nclear keys & sleep request, such as:\n  cryptsetup luksSuspend root\n  echo -n \"mem\" >/sys/power/state\n\nwill result in kernel in a call to sys_sync() which in turn causes a deadlock in dm-crypt (by design, after luks suspend)\n\nA: Actually, you just need to ensure that your screensaver passphrase is required on resume from suspend, and you'll be safe.\nThis will ensure that someone resuming your laptop from suspend will have to enter a password before they can get into the computer.\n\n", "Q: Any way to recover data on a re-installed Ubuntu OS on same partition? \nPossible Duplicate:\nFormatted and lost 6 years worth of photo memories.. any way to get this back?\nBest tools to recover removed files\nHow do I recover Ubuntu partition after computer failure\n\nOne day before I had Ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop I was trying to install an mp3 application during the process something broke (As far as I know it removed bin and usr directory for some weird reason) and from the next reboot it was not going further grub screen, one black screen with no information on it. \nI had then re-installed (Without formatting the partition) Ubuntu 11.04 on the same and the only partition I have.

Originally, I split the drive evenly between the two, but as I've been using Ubuntu far more heavily, and I'm running out of space on its partition, I want to reconfigure the partitions to give Ubuntu a greater share of disk space.\nI tried using GParted, both running from inside Ubuntu and from GParted's Live CD, but in both I get the following screen:\n\nAs you can see, Ubuntu has about 72GB of space. I've already shrunk the OSX partition down, leaving about 45GB of free space. I'm trying to expand the Ubuntu partition to include that additional 45GB of space, but GParted won't allow me to, presumably because of that weird \"unknown\" 1MB partition in the middle. I'm not 100% sure what it is, but the flags for it list \"bios_grub\", so I'm assuming it's where rEFIt installed Grub. Unfortunately, GParted won't let me relocate this partition, only delete it (and I'm sure I'd hose my system if I did that).\nHow can I resize my Ubuntu partition to use my free disk space?\n\nA: As Huckle said, booting from a live USB or live CD would probably make it possible. You can get what you need from the download site at ubuntu.com, and when you're ready you can boot into Ubuntu just as you're used to, and use GParted to move the partition to the left.\nHowever, I would recommend another approach:\nIt looks as if the only partitioning you've done is into one Mac partition and one Ubuntu partition. Consider creating a third partition for your data. (That partition could even be shared between both operative systems, if you want.)\nUsing for example the Disk Analyzer utility, you can identify the largest node of your Ubuntu file tree, and copy that over to the new partition (let's call it /dev/sda6, for the sake of this argument). When you have copied all the files you want, and verified that they were copied OK to the new partition, you can delete them from /dev/sda4. Note! If you chose to move system files, such as /usr or /home, you must reboot in single user mode before you delete the files!\nThen, edit your /etc/fstab to mount the new partition in the same place in the file system. For example, if /home/cerin/ was the largest folder, I would suggest moving cerin to the new partition and mount the partition at /home with the following fstab line:\n/dev/sda6 /home ext4  defaults 0 0\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with /etc/fstab, this guide seems to give a good introduction. It hasn't been updated for a couple of years, but I suspect that the basics of fstab haven't either =)\nWhile you're at it...\nIf it turns out your home folder isn't the largest folder in your file system, I would still recommend moving it aside on a separate partition. The main benefit of this is that if something fails on your Ubuntu system, you can reinstall Ubuntu from scratch and still keep most of your user settings. I'm running Ubuntu/Win7 dual booted on a 120GB SSD, and on that I've allocated 500MB for my home partition - it turns out this is on the edge of too little, and I've had to use some other quirks to work around this. I would (given that I know nothing of what files you have that's using up your space...) recommend a 40GB data partition and a 5GB home partition.\n\nA: I'd venture to say that you should be able to restore rEFIt by using a third party bootdisc for OSX after nuking the rEFIt partition and expanding Ubuntu. I've had great success with iBoot from TonyMac. Burn the disk and boot from that, select your OSX install and it should boot into that.\n", "Q: How to install amd k7 kernel in ubuntu I tried to install amd K7 kernel in ubuntu 11.10 (64 bit) but E: Unable to locate package  \nsudo apt-get install linux-k7\nsudo apt-get install linux-k7-smp\n\n\nA: Ubuntu does not provide processor specific kernels. If you are running a 64 bit version of Ubuntu then you are already running a kernel that will use the AMD K7 capabilities.\nIf you want a kernel compiled to match your specific processor then you will have to compile your own kernel.

Fonts that are normally white in other browsers for example, are a dull gray and almost impossible to read on certain backgrounds (blue for example). Is there any way to remedy this problem?\n\nA: Due to the way web pages are composed these days (with a premium on appearance rather than on function and with the rather thoughtless use of background images to convey information), accessibility for those with special requirements is often an issue.

This can be an old PC, a mobile phone, or a special Internet Radio device, just to name some examples. The devices do not need to be compatible to each other.\nA short tutorial on how to set up Icecast2 can be found here.

Advantage of this method is the quality of the source. Disadvantage is having to switching the monitor back and forth when viewing 3-D  and using the desktop in 2-D.\nMethod 2 - Use a player that can deliver interleaved 3-D, only one I know of for now is Youtube (in Firefox), using youtube videos.\nUsing Youtube as source, change the 3-D method to interlaced.\nYou can now watch 3-D either in the youtube window or expand youtube to fullscreen.\nAdvantage - no switching modes with the monitor.Disadvantage the variant quality of the source and you are limited to youtube clips.\nIn general you want to use 1080p for the source movies as the resolution is reduced to view 3-D (using passive).\nSo for movies at least, no special development/driver is required, just a 3-D capable player.\n", "Q: How do I get an HP LaserJet CP1025 color printer working? i have hplip 3.10.6 and it doesn't show any driver for 'Hp Laserjet cp1025 color'. is there a way to get the driver install?\n\nA: seems you need version 3.11.1 for this printer.\nThe instructions on this page may help, follow the instructions on how to install the newer hplip package.

However, the installation on my Dell Inspiron Laptop did not go as smoothly as the HP laptop I installed Ubuntu on previously.\nWhen I began to install Ubuntu, I got past the screen where it checks that you have the laptop plugged-in, and Internet connection and etc. The deviation from the previous installation came at this point. When I installed Ubuntu last time, there was a partition tool and a recommended partition already established and I simply accepted, installed and within 30 minutes was able to boot into Ubuntu and Windows 7, it was lovely!\nThis time, however, I selected “Something different,” having that option and deleting the entire hard drive.

Only problem was, Windows 7 is nowhere to be found...\nI am pretty sure I did not delete Windows, but I cannot see the Windows partition under the disk check and it does not show up under Grub. I have tried updating Grub and using command lines to generate the Grub list, but hd #'s are absent and root folders are just a series of letters and numbers. \nI am not that upset over losing Windows, other than not having it available if I must use it as well as not being able to retrieve files. I appreciate any help.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, I suggest using GParted to have a look at your actual partition table to see if Windows is still hanging around. It'll be easy to see since it'll likely be the only partition running NTFS as a file system.\nIf you see your Windows partition, then as other answers mention, just use a Windows 7 startup repair disk and repair the MBR. I had a similar answer for this type of thing earlier here.\nIf its gone, well then, you can always re-install as long as your Ubuntu install isn't sitting on the 1st primary partition of your hard disk (it may be if you inadvertently wiped Windows out while installing). Windows needs to be installed on that specific partition, so if you still want to dual boot, back up any files in Ubuntu, then start over by re-installing Windows 7 first (and wiping the entire disk in the process), and following that up by installing Ubuntu once again.\nBest of luck!\n\nA: Also try to use boot repair software for ubuntu\n", "Q: Automatically adjust the volume based on content?

See in the plugin documentation for more details, defaults and minimal resp maximal values for these controls.\nTo avoid clipping of playback we may also combine this plugin with a limiter after compression.

In the end, a KDE update solved the problem.\nIf you're using a laptop, you might want to try turning the WiFi off before shutting down, to see if that is the cause.

I have a computer that originally came with windows 7.  I recently installed Ubuntu 11.04 (natty) on it.  Now, I want to remove it from the computer while keeping windows.  Unfortunately, I don't have the windows recovery disk anymore... Is there a way I can delete ubuntu without deleting the booting program (the purple screen where you can select the operating system)?\n\nA: Why would you want to keep Ubuntu bootloader (GRUB) if you're removing Ubuntu? I'm not sure it's possible because I believe GRUB stores some of its files on the partition you're going to remove.\nI believe you need to re-install Windows boot loader, then you just boot into Windows and delete Ubuntu partition using standard Windows tools. You may be able to resize the windows partition to take up the free space or create a new NTFS partition there.\n(as such, the question turns out to be totally unrelated to Ubuntu... you can do everything in Windows)\n\nA: google for easy bcd and install it while in windows. With this program you can create the MBR needed for the windows onls system. After that you can delete ubuntu partition and you are fine.\n\nA: You could also try to create recovery disc:\nhowtogeek.com/howto/5409/create-a-system-repair-disc-in-windows-7/\nif that seems more convenient to You. \nIf needed You can use Windows bootloader. In menu start write msconfig and press enter. Than in boot options You have to find option: other systems display time or something similar.

I'm aware that it only saves the settings and not the files, so my question is: \nCan I restore it from another hard-drive or live CD?\nI'm fairly new to Linux, but I'm gaining ground after getting \"greedy\" with all the possibilities included with the open source software.

The\n  format is not yet supported by FAAC/FAAD.\"\n\nSince faac/faad seems to be used in every other converting tool on Ubuntu, how can I successfully convert formats?\n\nA: While both the answers involving ffmpeg/avconv (which I think are essentially the same tool) both work, they currently have a flaw. Namely that lossless m4a is often 24 bit sample, and currently ffmpeg/avconv will generally force the conversion to end up in 16 bit sample.\nI believe using sndfile-convert (libsndfile) does not have this problem. Likewise, I believe it can be avoided by using mplayer to decode the m4a before encoding it with ffmpeg or flac. I think soundKonverter on KDE may do this for you.\nIn any case, whatever you do, I suggest checking whether the original and the converted file have the same bit depth of samples.\n\nA: You can convert an m4a file to flac with the ffmpeg command-line tool:\nTo install ffmpeg:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nTo convert:\nffmpeg -i filein.m4a -f flac fileout.flac\n\n\nA: sudo aptitude install libav-tools\n\nfor file in *.m4a; do avconv -i \"$file\" -f flac \"`basename \"$file\" .m4a`.flac\"; done\n\n\nA: Personally I use this code. for file in *.m4a; do fname=$(basename \"$file\" .m4a); ffmpeg -i \"$file\" -vn -ar 48000 -f flac  \"$fname\".flac; done.\nSo the output file don't have *.m4a.flac as extension.\nAnd this is the ouput from ffprobe on a flac file:\nStream #0:0: Audio: flac, 48000 Hz, stereo, s32 (24 bit)\nAnd don't forget to check the tags/metadata on the file. I was surprised to see my mail address in the tag/metadata. And ffprobe show more mtag/metada as Easytag.\n\nthanks to zetdotpi and https://stackoverflow.com/a/2664758\n\n\nA: Just combining all the useful information from the other three answers.\nTo check the bit depth on your mp4 files:\n# cd into desired directory then... \nffprobe -show_streams ./[pick one file to test].m4a | grep -e codec_name -e bits_per_raw_sample \n\nThis should show the bit depth at the bottom of the output.\nTo use ffmpeg and for all files in a folder (assuming they are not 24 bit (or higher)):\n# cd into desired directory then... \nfor file in *.m4a ; do ffmpeg -i \"$file\" -f flac \"$( basename \"$file\" .m4a ).flac\" ; done \n\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: How do I show recently logged in users in GDM? All of our machines here access a directory server for most accounts, and have one local account (well, plus all of the standard ones)\nThe login screen only ever shows the one local account ('nadmin'), and, on the whole, won't show any other accounts.\nWhat I want is to be able to have any recently logged in accounts to be shown on that screen.\nStrangely, on a couple of machines, there is one other user shown, but I have no idea how they ended up there. It doesn't seem to be based around any kind of recent login.\nAny idea how I can get this to work?\n\nA: You question wasn't very clear, so just in case, I'd very much suggest NOT displaying that information prior to a successful login. Displaying that makes it just a bit easier for a black hat to figure out what usernames can be tried.\nI would suggest displaying information after a successful login by adding last | head -10 to your /home/UserName/.bashrc.\n\nIf you want it for all users, it ought to get in /etc/bashrc.\n", "Q: How can I configure the login screen to be displayed in portrait orientation? I just started using linux, and I have one question. I have a monitor that I rotated 90◦ clockwise, so it, being rectangle shaped, is taller than it is wider.\nUsing the system settings in Ubuntu, I set it up, and it works great, except the login screen and loading screen are not rotated right. They are rotated in the \"normal\" way. Is this just a glitch, or is there some setting I overlooked? I am using the open source drivers, and it is an ATI card, if that matters.\n\nA: When I boot my computer, the graphics look different than when I am logged in (not using open source nvidia driver)... so I am guessing it might be that you need to set your computer to boot with those options.  It sounds like you set your Desktop environment (Unity/Gnome/Xfce/KDE, whatever you use) to display your desktop rotated.  So, I think you need some thing to boot your machine in sideways mode.  I can't give you a solution, HOWEVER, I can point you to ubuntuforums.org (where there is a lot of ubugurus hanging out), and possible check out the GRUB2 documentation (assuming you are using a more recent version of Ubuntu since you are new to it...)

Notice that as far as the 'Documents' folder is concerned, I don't encounter this problem, since the word is the same in both languages.\n\nA: Currently there is no way to do this, and the folders will have the same name in both devices.\nOne partial workaround could be to create a \"Musique\" symlink pointing at \"Music\" in the french-localized machine, and then you would have both \"Music\" and \"Musique\" there.\n", "Q: How come firefox has no settings? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I get the menu bar in firefox? \n\nI've installed the latest ubuntu.

I want to see the contents of a debian package, especially if the package is properly cleaning up whatever it installs.\nI want to also see how it goes about installing the software, what directories it creates, symbolic links etc.\n\nA: There is dpkg -c package.deb, which lists the files installed by the package, and dpkg --info package.deb, which shows general information including which configuration scripts exist (these are run at various points during installation).\nIn addition, it is rather difficult for a .deb package to not clean up installed files, because these are tracked automatically, except for files created from scripts. Debian has the piuparts service, which tests this automatically for packages in the Debian archive.\n\nA: Yes it is. A Debian package is in fact only an archived folder. So you should be able to open it with the default Archive Manager (right click -> Open with Archive Manager\n). Optionally, you can also extract wherever you want. I hope you will be able to learn a lot from doing so.\n\nA: Use\ndpkg -x somefile.deb somefolder\n\nto extract the file that somefile.deb contains into folder somefolder\nUse\ndpkg -e somefile.deb somefolder\n\nto extract the control data (package scripts, metadata,...) of somefile.deb into folder somefolder. \nSome archive manager let you just browser Debian packages like any other archive file.\n\nA: Yes, its just a normal AR archive, like tar part in tar.gz files ( Tape ARchive in that case ) \nContents of this archive are three files:\n\n\n*\n\n*debian-binary: deb format version number. This is \"2.0\" for current versions of Debian.\n\n*control.tar.gz: all package meta-information. It tells dpkg what to configure when the package is being installed.\ndata.tar, data.tar.gz, data.tar.bz2, data.tar.lzma or data.tar.xz: the actual installable files.\n\n*The debian-binary file must be the first entry in the archive, otherwise it will not be recognized as a Debian package.\n\n\nA: You can use dpkg in a terminal to see which files are in an installed package.\ndpkg -L <package>\n\nYou can also use it to find out which package a specific file came from.\ndpkg -S <file>\n\nTo list the content of a .deb-file.\ndpkg -c <file.deb>\n\nIn order to evaluate what pre/post-install actions are taken these files need to be extracted and manually viewed.\ndpkg -e <file.deb> [folder] \n\nSee the man-page for dpkg for more options.\n\nA: For installed packages you can see a list of the directories and files it creates as well as the scripts that are used for installation and removal in /var/lib/dpkg/info.  All the files are named based on the package.  Various extensions indicate the files purpose.  \nThese files can also be found in the .deb which can be viewed with an archive viewer.

However, in their own right, they are Vanilla too.\nIf you want to be extremely technical, Vanilla Ubuntu is a fresh install with no extra packages installed and no changes made.\nIn a broader sense, Vanilla Ubuntu can refer to Ubuntu (the OS) as opposed to any derived OS, or to Ubuntu (the OS) with any of the officially supported Desktops (KDE, LXDE or XFCE), but without any third party software (that is, software from a source other than the official repositories.\nVanilla Ubuntu cannot refer to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu with all proprietary or closed source components removed (like GNUSense).\n\n*\n\n*This is a derivative, and also consists of removing packages and keeping a strict rule of free software only.\n\n\n*A remaster of any kind.\n\n*Ubuntu with a customized UI (at the code level).\n\n*\n\n*Customizing at the code level invalidates the \"Vanilla nature\" of the OS.\n\n\n\nA: Vanilla Ubuntu as said before, is Ubuntu as supplied by Canonical using the default desktop (Unity) and the default repositories.\n", "Q: How to download video from web page? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to download flash (streaming) videos from sites like youtube, dailymotion, vimeo, etc.? \n\nI'm learning how to program and I want to know how to download a video from a web page.  I don't want to use software to do it for me, I want to make it myself.  I was thinking that I could get the video element's ID and then download it, but I'm stuck as I don't know much about HTML or web design.\n\nA: This is not really related to ubuntu. And what you are asking for is for the most part not as easy. Now days most of the video sites around uses flashplayers. This hides the real location of the video from the user. To find out the real location you could try to download the flashplayer from the site and try to figure out how to get a direct link to the video. It requires some knowledge and I think you're better of using an already existing software.\n", "Q: Screen cuts off part of GRUB on boot I've recently installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my Windows 7 desktop computer (on a seperate partition) Everything has gone smoothly except when I restart the computer and GRUB's loader screen shows, part of the screen gets cut off.. but once ive selected a boot option and hit enter, the screen readjusts to fill the entire monitor properly. \nSo my question is, is there a way I can correct this ? Kind of annoying not being able to see the full boot option\n\nA: Installing boot repair or start-up manager may solve your problem.. In these softwares there is an option to fix the resolution of GRUB..

Using system title bar and borders will make all the buttons appear, but I really want to use the theme because the system title bar makes the top bar too thick.\nLogging out and back in didn't fix it, and I tried reinstalling Chrome, but the problem persists.\n\nA: Okay, I've found a workaround involving the use of Ubuntu-Tweak. Using Window Manager Settings, check Custom under Window Titlebar Button Layout. Then simply moving one of the elements to a different location and then moving it back again will cause all the buttons to appear correctly.\n\nA: One way to fix this is to install gnome-tweak-tool. Once installed and launched select \"Shell\" and you will have some options for the titlebar buttons.\nI think this is what you are after.\ngconftool-2 --set \"/desktop/gnome/shell/windows/button_layout\" --type string \"close, minimize, maximize:\"\n\nAfter that just restart gnome-shell.\n", "Q: How do I get the super key working properly in Emacs?

(assuming that is the problem - not sure why its displaying the small S rather than the capital but I am guessing that is something to do with it).\n\nA: The issue is related to the capital/lower case S.\nS as a modifier refers to Shift whereas s refers to super.\nC-S-RET means Ctrl+Shift+RET in this case (and others referencing C-S-<key> rather than Ctrl+super+RET.\n", "Q: Changing symlinks does not work for directories In order to change a symbolic link, one can use the -fs option to eliminate the need to unlink or delete the old link first. However, trying to do so on directories does not seem to work:\n$ mkdir dir1\n$ mkdir dir2\n$ ln -s  dir1 lnk\n$ ln -sf dir2 lnk\n$ ll\n......... lnk -> dir1\n$\n\nWhy so? Is there another option to do this with directories the same as with files?\n\nA: By default, if you pass a directory (or a symlink to a directory) as the second argument to the ln command, it will create a link inside that directory with the same name as the first argument.  So with the set of commands you have issued, you should find a symlink named dir2 inside dir1.\nYou can change this behaviour using the -T option:\n-T, --no-target-directory\n       treat LINK_NAME as a normal file\n\nIf you pass this option in your second ln invocation, then it should overwrite the lnk symlink rather than creating a new symlink inside the first directory.\n", "Q: Can I Upgrade to 11.10 on my PPC 10.04?

I am the lucky owner of a pivot monitor, which screen can be rotated (physically). What is the easiest way to make my display turn when I turn my monitor?\nFor the moment I first launch the 'Displays' app, and then change the settings and confirm. But this is in fact quite a laboured procedure, since I want to switch my orientation up to a few times per minute.\nSo is there an indicator for this, or equivalent? Can I set a keyboard shortcut that would launch a dedicated command? In fact I am thinking of something similar to the Windows program iRotate.\n\nA: Here is a nice example on how to do it based on sensor input:\nhttps://linuxappfinder.com/blog/auto_screen_rotation_in_ubuntu\nSo basically try the above to identify the screen you want to see rotated.\nDepending on the model monitor there may be a sensor that sends a signal?\nThis works nicely for my Lenovo Yoga 2 11 with builtin rotation sensor and it moves the unity dock too.\nThe script:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Auto rotate screen based on device orientation\n\n# Receives input from monitor-sensor (part of iio-sensor-proxy package)\n# Screen orientation and launcher location is set based upon accelerometer position\n# Launcher will be on the left in a landscape orientation and on the bottom in a portrait orientation\n# This script should be added to startup applications for the user\n\n# Clear sensor.log so it doesn't get too long over time\n> sensor.log\n\n# Launch monitor-sensor and store the output in a variable that can be parsed by the rest of the script\nmonitor-sensor >> sensor.log 2>&1 &\n\n# Parse output or monitor sensor to get the new orientation whenever the log file is updated\n# Possibles are: normal, bottom-up, right-up, left-up\n# Light data will be ignored\nwhile inotifywait -e modify sensor.log; do\n# Read the last line that was added to the file and get the orientation\nORIENTATION=$(tail -n 1 sensor.log | grep 'orientation' | grep -oE '[^ ]+$')\n\n# Set the actions to be taken for each possible orientation\ncase \"$ORIENTATION\" in\nnormal)\nxrandr --output eDP1 --rotate normal && gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher launcher-position Left ;;\nbottom-up)\nxrandr --output eDP1 --rotate inverted && gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher launcher-position Left ;;\nright-up)\nxrandr --output eDP1 --rotate right && gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher launcher-position Bottom ;;\nleft-up)\nxrandr --output eDP1 --rotate left && gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher launcher-position Bottom ;;\nesac\ndone\n\nand prerequisite for the sensors:\nsudo apt install iio-sensor-proxy inotify-tools\n\n\nA: Slightly simpler variation of Vincent Gerris's answer based on sensor input:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Auto rotate screen based on device orientation\n\nmonitor-sensor | \\\nwhile IFS= read -r str; do\n  if [[ $str =~ orientation\\ changed:\\ (.*)$ ]]; then\n    case \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\" in\n    normal)\n      xrandr --output eDP-1 --rotate normal ;;\n    bottom-up)\n      xrandr --output eDP-1 --rotate inverted ;;\n    right-up)\n      xrandr --output eDP-1 --rotate right ;;\n    left-up)\n      xrandr --output eDP-1 --rotate left ;;\n    esac\n  fi\ndone\n\n\n\nA: Works great with\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --rotate left\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --rotate right\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --rotate inverted\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --rotate normal\n\n\nA: Go into Keyboard -> Shortcuts, select \"Custom Shortcuts\", and press \"+\" to add a new shortcut.\n\"Name\" is a descriptive name for the action (i.e. \"Rotate monitor\"). In \"Command\" type the custom command to run when the shortcut is activated.\nOnce the shortcut is in the list, select its row, press ENTER, then the key combination you want to activate the shortcut. If there's a conflict, the shortcut manager will tell you so, and you can choose a different combination.\nYou can have shortcut to enable rotated display and another to bring it back to an upright position. You can even, if you're knowledgeable enough, write a command that maintains state and just toggles between upright/rotated.\nNow, as for the command you need to use, it's probably xrandr:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --rotate left\n\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --rotate normal\n\nThe output parameter depends on which port your monitor is plugged into.

First I uninstalled mplayer and replaced it with mplayer2 since it is supposedly capable of gapless playback. \nNow I know gtstreamer can do gapless but some of my files have glitches when using the gtstreamer option in the audio preferences of Gmusicbrowser which is why I am using the mplayer option instead. Now what exactly do I put in the options box to make playback gapless on gmusicbrowser using mplayer2? \n\nA: Enabling the gapless option (-gapless-audio) in SMplayer2 doesn't work. So probably it (the same command) won't work in Gmusicbrowser as well.\nI've tried all of the Linux music players, but only those consistently support gapless playback:\n\n\n*\n\n*DeadBeef\n\n*Auqualung\n\n*Audacious\n\n*MPD\n\n*XMMS2\n\n\nAdding the Gstreamer developer PPA solves the gapless issue in Guayadeque and may do so in Gmusicbrowser as well.

I have been a long time windows user till about thanksgiving when I switched to ubuntu. on windows I used firefox because I could trust the security that it gave. Since malware/virus are next to none on ubuntu (and yes I have read  up on all of the diffent point of views on both sides of having ubuntu security software or not) is google chrome just as safe on linux or should I stick with firefox?\n\nA: from my experience, as an average user I would say you don't have to worry so much about malware on linux than on windows. This might be very different if you are running servers with important content on it. \nSince you have to approve anything that could be harmful to your core system (ie. anything that happens outside of /home) by giving your root password malware can't really affect your system settings, unless ofcourse you unknowingly grant them access.\nSo just stick to the rules...only download executable packages from trusted and/or well reviewed sources and NEVER run wine in sudo mode^^\nRegarding the browsers I'd say either one is fine. I've used firefox for 3 years and I am now using Chromium for about a year and a half and I have never had problems with facebook hacks or anything like that.\nFrom a very subjective point of view...I like the user experience with Chromium a little better though.\n\nA: This is really a matter of opinion as you're correct in that there aren't as many viruses or malware written to target Linux based operating systems. Of course, that doesn't mean that there aren't any either.\nIf you're concerned, maybe just install something like Avast and at the very least you've got some decent virus protection for free.\nSo it's up to you and your comfort level. In terms of a browser, I recommend Chromium as it has sandboxing for the web browser rendering services which are really quite good.\nCheck out the Chromium security principles. Nice piece of mind as well.\n\nA: Linux is not invulnerable and there are cross platform vulnerabilities.\nCheck out http://www.ubuntu.com/usn for firefox vulnerabilities as well.\nAt the end of the day, you need to match your security with the value of your assets on your computer or the sites you connect to.\nThere are some common protection you should do on any OS, for example you should only conduct financial transactions on an encrypted connection, ie https\nConsiderations for Firefox on Ubuntu would be:\n1) Enable the apparmor firefox profile.\nsudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox\n\n2) You might want to use NoScript. Only you can decide if the hassle is worth the additional security.\n3) Social engineering ( Phishing ) is often more effective then cracking and works on any os.\n", "Q: How to successfully restart a network without reboot? When I am using Ubuntu, sometimes the network goes down and there is no option to bring back the wired network. There is always option for wireless, but no option for wired network. In such case I try sudo service network-manager restart (using a command line just to start the interface). This works sometimes, sometimes it takes many iterations and other times it never starts. In my country the network goes down without any reason. I even wrote a perl script to run above script for at least 10 iterations and scheduled it using Cron. Since lately I cannot start the network using above command unless I restart the computer. What is the problem with the computer, why can't a network restart become a first class citizen in Ubuntu and needs a computer reboot. Why isn't there an option that never goes down just like wireless network to start wired network. Is there something I am missing. The command sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart does not seem to do anything at all.\n\nA: The \"Wired network\" option in the NetworkManager indicator becomes greyed out if no connection is detected over the cable. First of all I would check that you are not using a faulty cable or router.\nIf it really is a problem with the driver or network hardware on your computer, you might want to try unloading and reloading the kernel module responsible for handling your wired network adaptor. You can find the name of the module by running lspci -k, looking for the entry corresponding to your network card, and reading the name off the line \"Kernel driver in use\". Then do sudo rmmod <name> ; sleep 5 ; sudo modprobe <name>, replacing <name> with the name of the kernel module in question. The network hardware should be re-initialized in the process, so the effect should be pretty close to a reboot.\n\nA: You can run this command to take down all interfaces:\nsudo ifdown -a\n\nThen run this to bring them back up again:\nsudo ifup -a\n\nHope that helps!\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to restart the networking service?\n\nA: In Xubuntu, which might differ from Ubuntu, I can deactivate the network as a whole in the Panel (but not just Eth). \nYour problem doesn't sound like normal behaviour, so there is no normal way to deal with it. \nAnother solution, which might trigger a restart, would be to pull the cable and plug it again. \nInvestigating your lookfiles might help you to find out, what is going on, and what to fix. Try \ndmesg | tail -n 30 \n\non the next time your connection drops. \nAnother idea is, to unload the module for your network chip, and reload it again, like so.\nsudo rmmod 8139too\nsudo modprobe 8139too\n\nbut instead of 8139too, you have to find out what your card/chip is, and which module it uses. \n", "Q: Problem with Hibernate on Ubuntu 11.10 slow I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my machine and I notice several problems with the Hibernate functionality.

But this slow resume from hibernate is unacceptable and I would be glad if someone can help me repair it.\nI have a Core i5 processor with 8GB RAM. I have set about 6GB of hard disk space for swap.\nIt would be helpful if someone can help me identify and rectify the bottleneck in the resume process.\nAlso with Windows 7 I was able to setup my system to wake up from hibernate state automatically at a specified time.

I also need help to fix the ACPI Wakeup thing I mentioned above.\nIn case it matters I have an integrated Intel graphics card on my laptop.\n\nA: The bottle neck is that you have to write 8 GB of RAM to disk, worse yet you have to sort through 6 GB of swap to determine which data goes with what. Maybe try shrinking the swap partition (or removing it entirely, you have enough RAM) and see if that helps at all. Otherwise, we'll need to see some log files. man dmesg and man syslog\nIt could also be stubborn hardware.

It should be 10 or 15:\n\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nYou can change it on the fly with\n\nsudo bash -c \"echo  -e 10 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\"\n\nand make it stick with\n\nsudo bash -c \"echo 'vm.swappiness = 15' >> /etc/sysctl.conf\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu after boot shows a black screen with a warning reboot required I installed ubuntu in my system already having windows xp using wubi.. \nAfter the rebooting i selected ubuntu and a black screen appears with a message stack : 49 59 aa and stops thr and does not boot it is also telling it has changed to text console due to error and it hangs.... my keyboard does not work after that. \nwhat should i do?\n\nA: Reinstall your Ubuntu through Ubiquity (LiveCD, DVD and USB standard Ubuntu installer) because Wubi file system isn't normal for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: 11.10 desktop alerts (volume change and terminal bell) stopped working but all other audio still works All,\nMy sound works just fine in 11.10 64-bit install on HP dm1-4050 Sandy Bridge notebook (e.g. audio works in Banshee, flash, games, browser, Thunderbird email notification, etc.), but the core desktop notifications (e.g. pressing a tab in a terminal where there is more than one option should trigger a terminal bell, or changing volume using volume keys should be accompanied with the supporting \"quack\" that the volume app makes) do not work. I've intentionally disabled login sound as explained here on ask ubuntu but even enabling it back makes no difference. These notifications did work before just fine and I am not sure when did the actually stop working but it must've been fairly recently.\nOnly things I did were trying to install some ppa edge xorg drivers for my intel card (a separate issue) but also reverted them all with ppa-purge once I discovered they did not improve anything. Other thing I did was check volume settings with alsamixer and did alsactl store for the soundcard after I did some experimenting with volume settings for PCM (on my laptop PCM at 100% crackles so I had to lower it and make pulseaudio ignore its setting as per ask ubuntu's page). That said, neither of these should have any bearing on the said notifications since the volume is up and they clearly work everywhere else but the core desktop events. The system ready drum sound when Ubuntu boots and user reaches the login screen also does not work.\nThe guest login behaves exactly same as mine. Audio works (including the login sound since I've not disabled it for the guest account), but no quacks when changing the volume or terminal bell sounds...\nI've tried copying ubuntu sounds to /usr/share/sounds/ as suggested on ask ubuntu and that did not work. I also tried using dconf-editor to check sound theme settings and tried both freedesktop (which is what it was set to) and ubuntu, as suggested on ask ubuntu. This did not work either. I tried purging the  ~/.pulse folder and the /tmp/*pulse* entries, rebooting and restarting pulseaudio with -D flag. While audio came back on and behaved just fine in all aspects (e.g. one can adjust volume levels, play music, games, in-browser sound stuff, and other app alerts) except for the system ready drum sound (at the login screen), and any system event (terminal bell and volume change quack sound). It is interesting that the quack sound works inside system settings->sound when adjusting levels there, but it does not when volume is changed via top bar's volume settings... I do recall that at one point yesterday when I was restarting pulseaudio the quacks that accompany volume change did start working but I have no idea what caused that. This was also when I first realized those alerts were not working. After rebooting it was again gone.\nI did compile my own 3.0.14-rt31 kernel a little while ago as instructed on one of the wiki's for the 11.10 rt kernel. Everything works as before except for the said sound alerts. I am not sure if this began happening since I started using the rt kernel though and yesterday's momentary ability to hear those quacks while changing the volume make me believe that the kernel is not one responsible for this problem.\nOne more thing I can think of is that I used alsoft-conf tool to configure buffering on the OpenAL (due to TA Spring's choppy audio) and changed in there default audio device to ALSA. I also tried reverting it to Pulseaudio as the only allowed output but the bottom part of the Backend tab always reverts to ALSA even when I select Pulseaudio. The pulseaudio does remain as the only active choice on top. This, however, once again does not make any sense in terms of preventing desktop audio alerts when everything else including OpenAL games plays sound just fine...\nSo, there you have it, as verbose as I could make it :-). I tried all I could find on this issue and had no luck so far... Any ideas?\n\nA: This is not a sound problem; the event is getting lost, as can be seen in the system settings => universal access => hearing tab.  Setting it to visual alerts also does not work.\nI found that all of this works as expected using metacity (run metacity --replace), but then stops working when you go back to Compiz (run compiz --replace).\nNote:  I did this in Gnome compatibility mode.  In compiz, it seems that metacity doesn't run, although everything else keeps running, and with a terminal, you can get back to compiz/unity from the terminal.  Note, though, that the terminal bell will work in this mode.\n\nA: A potential explanation is what I mentioned above (with some edits in the light of new developments), namely:\nThis problem may have been fixed in the 12.04 release, at least partially (the volume quacks are there but terminal bell isn't). The said, the kernel may also play a part in this. The system I was originally running linux-rt kernel which is apparently missing some of the Ubuntu tweaks that allow this. Reverting to linux-lowlatency fixed this (which makes sense since rt kernel is not supported while lowlatency practically offers the same performance)... Hope this helps!\nThat said, I do have now a situation where volume adjustments do sound out but the terminal bell doesn't. This is on a 12.04 beta and things are changing on a daily basis, so that may be a part of it as well...\n", "Q: What is the rationale for where exactly \"Ubuntu\" is placed in the browser user agent string? Firefox has \"Ubuntu\" placed just before \"X11\" while Chromium has it placed later on in the string (after \"(KHTML, like Gecko)\").\nThere have been instances of web sites not recognizing Firefox only when the distro is Ubuntu: in two cases (http://www.summitracing.com/ and http://translink.com.au/), it appears that the web master fixed the issue somehow. The third instance (http://www.property24.com/) wasn't yet fixed when I last checked.\nIn the first and third cases, the page concerned didn't open and users were asked to download something like \"Mobile.aspx\". In the second case, users got mark-up meant for mobile platforms.\nUsers of other Linux distros didn't have problems and those using a version of Firefox downloaded directly from Mozilla didn't have a problem either.\nUsers of Chromium on Ubuntu didn't have the problem either.\nAt the time of posting, http://www.property24.com/ still offers to download Mobile.aspx and doesn't open the page correctly if \"Ubuntu\" is present ahead of \"X11\".\nIf I tweak the user agent string to Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:11.0a2) Gecko/20120114, Ubuntu, Firefox/11.0a2, the page loads without issue.\nThe issue with http://www.property24.com/ is discussed here as pointed out by Ocky over here.\nThe \"summitracing\" issue was reported here.\nEdit: bug 89774 relates to issues arising from introduction of \"Ubuntu\" into the UA string. A \"patched\" beta Firefox is available for testing. Details of the ppa are available at Chris Coulson's blog.\n\nA: To answer your question... There is no rationale.\nThere is no consistent set of rules for formatting of the User Agent string that browser vendors or package maintainers are following.  So, no web site can rely on that string for accurate information when serving a page.\nThe problem you describe is caused by a poor development practice at the sites, not an error in the UA string.\nref: http://www.sitepoint.com/why-browser-sniffing-stinks/\n", "Q: how to transfer installed programs to other pc My ubuntu laptop is customised with all the programs and themes of my choise,can i transfer these software to another computer running ubuntu and install them there via usb drive.\n\nA: It's not impossible, but it is a lot of work. However, it sounds like you want to keep the applications settings so that you don't have to reconfigure things. Good news! Unlike Windows, settings are not connected to the application. All settings are stored in your home directory, so if you copy it to another computer and reinstall the software, it'll be exactly as it was on the other computer. \nTransferring a specific applications settings is also very easy. New software will usually store their settings in ~/.config/application_name/, it's data in ~/.local/share/application_name/ and cache in ~/.cache/application_name. Unfortunately, not all applications follow that convention yet. The old convention was to store it directly in your home directory, such as ~/.appname. \n\nA: I know a manual way to do this, so here it goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives to a folder on your USB drive. Alternatively you could create a disc image repository using AptOnCD.\n\n*In the file manager (Nautilus), in your home directory, display hidden folders (to do this temporarily the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+H). Folders starting with a period are the hidden folders, and contain your user preferences to the applications you use. Find the folders of the applications you want to back up (for instance .thunderbird or .wine) and copy all of those to (preferably) a different folder on your USB drive.\n\n*Now on the computer that you wish to configure the same way as your first computer, from your USB drive copy all those Deb files into /var/cache/apt/archives (you'd have to do it as root) if you want to install them from Synaptic (it's a little nicer to do in Synaptic because if Synaptic finds a newer version of that package, it'll download it from the Internet). Alternatively you can go to that folder in the terminal (in the terminal you could do cd /media/usbdrive/debfiles/ and then running sudo dpkg -i *.deb to install all those deb files. You may want to go into Synaptic afterwards to make sure you don't have any missing packages to install.\n\n*Lastly, copy those folders starting with a period into your new home directory. If there was already a folder there, you could delete it first (make sure that application is closed). For instance while Thunderbird isn't running, delete .thunderbird in your home directory and copy over .thunderbird from your USB drive.\n\n\nThat should provide you with a quick installation (well you save on download time) of all the software you use and a quick importation of your user configuration of those applications. Enjoy.\n\nA: While you are coping the files into new Computer, make sure that the new computer is running the same version as the previous (where you copy all the Files).\nIf there is not same version of ubuntu then the System may be crashed. So be careful before doing this.\n", "Q: KDE 4.7.3: how to remember ssh key passphrase in konsole? I am using latest KDE in Kubuntu 11.10, I have ssh keys added protected by a passphrase which is prompted every time I try to establish ssh connection. In Gnome it would pop up a GUI window where I entered this passphrase once after login, and it never asked for it later on. How can I make KDE remember my passphrase?\n\nA: if you are using the terminal, then probably this might be a solution for you.\nThe idea is to add the code they state into your .bashrc. Thus, you will need to input it only once at login, the same way you used to have while under ubuntu.\nHope it works for you :)\n\nA: Basically, you should use ssh-agent. \nUse the command ssh-agent bash\nSee here for more information.\n", "Q: Why won't the application menu appear in Gnome Panel?

How do I access if I can not even get to a terminal to try and re-install Nvidia driver manually or un-install it.\n\nA: Best way to access your system is to boot to recovery mode. You will boot to a command line only interface, but should be sufficient to remove the nvidia driver.\n\nA: When you arrive at the login screen press the keys Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to TTY1, there you will be able to login and remove the Nvidia drivers.\nI have to also say this problem comes because you have a multiple monitor setup and you can still use gnome-shell by removing the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf (sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf), running nvidia-xconfig (sudo nvidia-xconfig)  and rebooting will make your system boot and gnome-shell will work with 1 screen enabled.\nStart by following the steps to boot up with 1 monitor only and once in gnome-shell you can think about what to do next (try a new xorg.conf setup or remove the drivers your installed).\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to TTY1\nCtrl+Alt+F1\n\n*Make a backup of your xorg.conf file with a different namesudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\n\n*Let Nvidia create a new xorg.conf filesudo nvidia-xconfig\n\n*Rebootsudo reboot\nYou should boot and be able to run gnome-shell now.\n", "Q: How do I configure Firestarter to allow NetBIOS name lookups When Firestarter is running (using default settings), I can't look up names of local Windows shared PCs (nmblookup fails with ERRNO=Operation not permitted).

I tried executing `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`` but this doesn't change anything.\nAny hints how I can fix this issue are appreciated.\n\nA: Your error messages are probably related to the fact that you have Gnome-3 PPA enabled.\nA recent change in this PPA promoted the use of python-gobject and deprecated the use of python-nautilus.\nBasically you can't have python-nautilus installed.  \nYou have a couple of choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stick with using the PPA and you cannot continue using nautilus-actions etc.\n\n*ppa-purge the Gnome-3 PPA and you will then be able to use nautilus-actions etc.\n\n\nYou should perhaps post a bug-report on the Gnome-3 PPA to see if they have any thoughts on backporting nautilus-actions from Precise to Oneiric.\n", "Q: Unity MT grab Handles plugin disappeared!

The resulting file is about 1.2Gb large.\nThe network speed is reasonably fast (copying from the network drive to the local occurs at ~28MB/sec).\nNow I want to use public-key encryption to encrypt the tar.gz file before transferring it to the network drive, and would like to know what the best way to do so is.\nShould I create the file locally first, encrypt it, and then copy over?\nOr is there a way to \"stream\" tar output through an encryption process, and write the results directly to the network drive? \n\nA: Pack your_dir in a encrypted archive your_archive.tgz.gpg (symmetric encryption):\ntar -cz your_dir | gpg -c -o your_archive.tgz.gpg\n\nUnpack it:\ngpg -d your_archive.tgz.gpg | tar xz\n\nSee the docs of GPG for how to use asymmetric instead of symmetric encryption.\n\nA: The following process encrypts the file on local disk first, and can then be sent over the network (or stored however needed)\n\nFirst, generate public and private keys (done only once):\nopenssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048\nopenssl rsa -in key.pem -out key-public.pem -outform PEM -pubout\n\nThen, at each backup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate long random passphrase, save in file\n\n\n*\n\n*echo -n \"Tl4R6dnvWXiDeXr1LtpCNkyLG1\" > key.txt\n\n\n*encrypt file with passphase\n\n\n*\n\n*openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pass file:key.txt < UNENCRYPTED_FILE > encrypted.dat\n\n\n*encrypt passphrase with public key\n\n\n*\n\n*openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey key-public.pem < key.txt > enc.key.txt\nThen save encrypted.dat AND enc.key.txt where desired.\n\nTo decrypt:\n\n\n*\n\n*Decrypt encrypted passphrase with private key\n\n\n*\n\n*openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey key.pem < enc.key.txt > key.txt\n\n\n*Decrypt file\n\n\n*\n\n*openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -pass file:key.txt < encrypted.dat > UNENCRYPTED_FILE\n\n\nThis is a lot longer than Florian's anwser, but I decided to use it so I can better understand the process, and not depend on server-dependent GPG configuration variables, etc. I also couldn't find any useful GPG documentation.\n\nA: I do this with asymmetric key encryption. That means I have a public key (that I can share with anyone I'd like to send me encrypted packages) which allows me to encrypt the package. I also have a private key (that I do not share) which allows me to decrypt the package.\nMy commands to encrypt the current working directory: the -e to encrypt, the -r to specify a \"recipient\" or key to use, the -o to specify the output file.\n$ tar -cvz . | gpg -e -r ABCD1234 -o backup.tgz.gpg\n\nAnd to decrypt to the current working directory:\n$ gpg -d backup.tgz.gpg | tar -xz\n\nOr to decrypt to a standard tgz file for later unpacking:\n$ gpg -o backup.tgz -d backup.tgz.gpg\n\nOf course, this only works if I have already generated a public-private key pair and installed it with gpg. In my case, I have done so using Digital Ocean's guide at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-gpg-to-encrypt-and-sign-messages-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps. The ABCD1234 in the encryption command refers to one of the public keys installed on my system. This guide also covers how to share your public key and install others' public keys to send and receive encrypted files.\n\nA: GnuPG is what I've chosen to used for this process and because you've stated that decryption steps where to opaque (I agree in this usage instance) I've also worked on that side of the problem too. Check the projects' Travis-CI build logs for what features currently work as designed and the travis.yml file for following along with the logs' output. Basically you'll need three scripts from this project; the keygen script, decryption helper script, and named pipe listener script. The keygen script & decryption helper script should be used on the device that will preform decryption and the named pipe listener script should be on the device preforming encryption.\nThe encrypting named pipe listener script accepts strings, file paths, or directory paths once setup and outputs encrypted results in a predictable fashion.\nBelow are example commands that could be placed into your nightly backup script for encryption and for directories compression+encryption\necho \"some messages text\" > /path/to/named.pipe\n## Message text is ASCII armor encrypted and appended to specified file when script was stated\necho \"${HOME}/Documents\" > /path/to/named.pipe\n## Directories are compressed with tar and encrypted with output to time stamped file in bulk output directory\necho \"${HOME}/.bash_history\"  > /path/to/named.pipe\n\nFor decryption you'll want to check out how the build scripts .travis-ci/script_decrypt.sh & .travis-ci/test_search_script_decrypt.sh for how the appended strings of encrypted data are recovered and how bulk files/directories are restored.\nOf course with stuff this experimental it's best to not use primary key pares (kinda why the keygen script was written) and it should not be used on important data until you're confident in how to restore it to readable form.\n\nA: I used the great solution of Florian Diesch above, but ran into this issue:\ngpg: problem with the agent: Inappropriate ioctl for device\ngpg: error creating passphrase: Operation cancelled\ngpg: symmetric encryption of '[stdin]' failed: Operation cancelled\n\nIn addition to work with my Ubuntu 20.04, I needed to set for gpg:\n$GPG_TTY=$(tty)\n$export GPG_TTY\n\nlike described here\nThen I could proceed with the solution of Florian!

For what I promise are un-nefarious reasons, I'd like to programmatically fetch the Ubuntu One account details for the current user of an application (eg name, email, free space). Is there way to achieve this?\n\nA: Yes. Ubuntu One provides an OAuth-secured Web API for account details; the OAth credentials of the local user are accessible via the freedesktop.org secrets keyring service. Of course, you can't read these credentials willy-nilly, as the user needs to password-unlock them.\nFortunately, you do not need to navigate the maze of technologies on your own (as I did), but can instead can use a handy tool Ubuntu One provides:\nu1oauthrequest https://one.ubuntu.com/api/account/\n\nIf the current user doesn't have a U1 account, this will raise a CredentialsNotFound error.

I have an intranet without connection to the Internet, and then I have WiFi with connection to the Internet.\nCan I make a configuration that makes it possible to be connected to the Internet through WiFi and at the same time being connected to intranet through cable?\nI'm on a laptop.\n\nA: You can plug both in at the same time and be connected to both, but you can only use the Internet from one of them. The computer will prefer the cable. \nSo if you only have Internet access via one of them then yes you can be connected to both networks. But if both are capable of providing Internet access, then Ubuntu will prefer the cable (Ethernet) network to access the Internet (and not use the Wifi network to access the Internet).\nThe upside of using two connections that provide Internet access, is that if one is disconnected, you will keep on using the Internet without being affected.\nI have asked a similar question on the site before, that you might find useful. \n\nA: Yes. But at any particular time, the system will only actually be using one of them. I believe that in almost all cases, the ethernet connection is preferred over the wireless. There is probably some configuration change that could be made to prefer wireless, if that is what you wanted.\n\nA: No disrespect, but the question was hurt, badly.  See, you don't need \"Internet\" to use your router, you can connect most wireless gadgets these days to a router to use other functions that do not need a connection to the Internet at all.  So yes, he/she could be plugged in to the router with Internet access, and also connected via wireless to a different (perhaps more secure) router used in-house (maybe for file transfer or anything that does not need Internet access). So the answer is yes.\n\nA: Yes.

Is there a way I can install Rails without messing up the PHP stuff? Maybe have it default to the PHP server and switch to the Rails server when I use a certain port?\n\nA: You're misunderstanding how rails and php work.\nWhen you run rails server in the rails project, it runs it on port 3000 by default (for development).\nLAMP traditionally runs on port 80, so you can run both rails and LAMP at the same time.\nFor instructions on properly install rails on Ubuntu, take a look at this answer.\n\nA: For production environment you should consider using Apache to serve your Rails projects.\nThe easy way is using Apache mod-fcgid and run rail projects via fcgid.\nhttp://gabrito.com/post/running-ruby-on-rails-with-apache-2-and-mod_fcgid\nFor better performance, mod-passenger is usually preferred. But it might be harder to setup for beginners as Ubuntu install apache2-mpm-prefork + mod-php5 by default. mod-messenger depends on apache2-mpm-worker, but mod-php5 is incompatible with apache2-mpm-worker.\nI use mod-passenger with apache2-mpm-worker and run php script using mod-fcgid.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RubyOnRails#Configure_Apache\n\nA: Yes! as long as you run them in different ports... for example localhost:3000 for Rails and 8888 for PHP will work fine!\n\nA: On an older virtual cloud server I had about 10 small web apps and used both Nginx for my Rails web apps and Apache for my PHP apps on a single server (also note with Phusion Passenger for the rails apps). Nginx was set as the primary server. In the virtual hosts section of the nginx configuration file, if the requested URL was for a PHP app, then nginx would serve as a reverse proxy and hand the request off to the Apache server.

As in, if Windows 7 somehow adjusted a setting on the firmware of your card by installing one of it's drivers. Now, the standard Ubuntu driver is no longer working correctly as a result of this setting change. This is just a theory, but have you tried downloading or installing any \"restricted\" manufacturer specific drivers within Ubuntu for your particular network card?\nTo test this theory, if you can't find Linux specific drivers from the manufacturer, then have a look at trying a configuration using ndiswrapper, specifically ndisgtk. This would theoretically let you use the same \"driver\" as Windows is using and thus may alleviate your issue.\nTo install ndisgtk, in a terminal just do a:\nsudo apt-get install ndisgtk\n\nBest of luck!\nUpdate: Seems to be related to your chipset/hardware as listed in the comments below. I did a Google search on \"ndisgtk RTL8111\" and sifted through to find this link, where someone solved an issue with this same chipset using Windows drivers and ndisgtk.

I remember I read that this used to be a problem with optical drives on Linux. It would keep on polling after every few seconds.

However so far I'm not seeing changes after that in the kernel tree that would affect the actual problem.

If a User A owns file.txt, can User A change the ownership of the file to User B without root access?  When i run a chown B file.txt as user A, I get a Operation not permitted error.  It seems to me that since User A owns the file, they ought to be able to change the ownership, but I don't see a way to do it.  Thanks for the help!\n\nA: No, you cannot change the owner a file without access, but if you own the file, you can change the permissions of the file with chmod and may change the group with chgrp to another group you a member of. \nRelated Question: chown is allowed to non root user?\n\nA: if you have access to user B, you could just copy the file while logged in as B. \nIf you also have access to user A, you could then log in and delete the original file.\nAnd finally rename the copied file, to the original name (again as B), leaving you with essentially the same file, owned by a different user.\nObviously is not the SAME file, but if you only cared about the contents of the file, this does the trick\n\nA: You can change the ownership of a file or folder without sudo, so long as you have read/write permissions on the thing, and you can only change the owner to YOU, not to an arbitrary user.  The trick is to simply copy whatever it is, delete the original then move your copy into its place.

This is a feature and not a bug. And one of the many reasons why the elders chose to put this feature in, has been explained in a comment to your question by roadmr\nBottom-line: Without root/sudo permissions you can change the permissions of the file using chmod, and the group ownership (to any group which you are a member of, with chgrp), if you are the owner of that file, but you cannot change the user ownership (using chown), even though you are the owner of the file, without having root/sudo permissions. This is a feature and not a bug.\n\nA: There is a strong argument to changing the ownership, because in my business, we get files from different users all the time and if the permission is such that you cannot do anything to the file other that read it, then we run it issues.\nSo what I found out was that it is easy to run a 'compress <data_filename>' followed by an 'uncompress <data_filename.Z>' which will do the trick and the ownership of the original file automatically changes to the current owner.\n", "Q: How to force Update Manager to use wired connection by default I prefer (out of superstition, I guess...) installing updates through a wired connection, and so I turn off my laptop's WIFI every time I'm about to give the Update Manager the go-ahead. A bit tedious. Is there a way to set the Manager's preferences so that it chooses the wired connection by default?\n\nA: My understanding is that when you are connected to a wired and a wireless connection at the same time, your computer will choose the wired ethernet connection. To test that theory on your laptop, plug in an ethernet cable and then go to the network manager applet in the top bar. Choose connection information from the menu and it should say you are connected to wired ethernet at the appropriate speed. \n", "Q: My system freezes randomly My system freezes randomly while using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox.

I have read about init-scripts, upstart-jobs and more, but I get even more confused the more I read. \nI've tried various guides, but I just haven't found anyone that actually work.\nCan someone show me how I create a simple script that will work in 11.10?\n\nA: Marty Fried's answer contains the one most valuable info: the Cookbook. Reading thru that makes you more than able to write your init scripts.\nHowever, messing with init.d, rc*.d, chkconfig et al, is not what you want to do. On Ubuntu (and other distros), they're just remains of the old sysvinit stuff which many packages still use or just support for legacy reasons. YOU DON'T NEED OR WANT TO GO THERE :-)\nSimplest of all Upstart scripts is starting a daemon (put it in /etc/init/mydaemon.conf):\nexec /path/to/binary\n\nThats ALL you need. That makes Upstart run the daemon when you do start mydaemon.\nOK, you want it to start automatically? Usually, starting after dbus is a logical choise, so lets do that:\nstart on started dbus\nstop on stopping dbus\nexec /path/to/binary\n\nThis simple script starts your daemon whenever dbus has started and will stop it just before dbus stops.\nYou want it to respawn (re-launch) if it crashes? No problem, just add respawn on its own line to the file.\nYour daemon forks or daemonizes itself? Well lets catch it nonetheless! Add expect fork in case of single fork, or expect daemon in case of true (double-fork) daemonization.\nLets summarize a simple startup script for your daemon:\nauthor \"Your name goes here - optional\"\ndescription \"What your daemon does shortly - optional\"\n\nstart on started dbus\nstop on stopping dbus\n\n# console output  # if you want daemon to spit its output to console... ick\nrespawn # it will respawn if crashed/killed\n\nexec /path/to/binary\n\nIn case you don't wanna run a daemon, but just a series of commands, lets forget the exec line and add a script section:\nscript\n   echo \"Hello world!\"\nend script\n\nThis makes Upstart run the script instead of the daemon. The script section is just a normal shell script, so you can do pretty much anything you want inside of it.\nHope it helps. Stick to the Upstart configuration files and don't mess with legacy sysv and you'll keep sane :-)\n\nA: Sounds like you were on the right track. Some of the confusion might arise because Ubuntu uses Upstart instead of the traditional Linux init system, but still supports the old methods.  So you may see outdated methods that still work.\nI'm not an expert, and I'm also not sure where you're getting lost, but have you read the information here: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\nIn /etc, there are a lot of examples to look at.  I think the actual scripts are in /etc/init, with links in various directories like rc0.d, rc1.d, on up.  These depend on what runlevels you want your script to run in.  I seem to recall that Ubuntu doesn't really use many run levels, so you may see a lot of duplication or unused links.\nAlso, keep in mind that the same scripts are used for starting and stopping.\n", "Q: Notification Alert sounds do not work After installing Ubuntu 11.10 on a new PC I have sound working and I have the Login Sound working but I don't get any other alert / notification sounds. e.g. If a question box pops up - there's no sound.\nI've tried some other suggestions like copying all the sound files to the /usr/share/sounds folder but this hasn't helped.\nAny ideas will be greatly received.\n\nA: This issue has been resolved in Ubuntu 12.04 by enabling system sounds using Ubuntu Tweak - \nThis worked for me in Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: I hope my answer isn't too simple, but did you check the volume control for alerts?\nThis has gotten me before...  in the system settings, under \"Sound\", there is, in addition to the \"Output volume\" at the top, a slider for \"Alert volume\" in the Sound Effects tab.\nI've been bit twice when this was set to minimum, and a lot of sounds didn't seem to work.\n\nA: I have found the answer to this problem, at least for my system.

I tried using different block scheduler, stuff like zramswap, tuning filesystem with data=writeback, experimenting with vm.swappiness (currently it's set to 10).. not much of a help. Here are the disk performance results:\npkug@travelmate:~$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sda\n\n/dev/sda:\n Timing cached reads:   1624 MB in  2.00 seconds = 812.32 MB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads: 102 MB in  3.05 seconds =  33.48 MB/sec\n\n\nA: This sounds awfully like kernel bug 12309, which I've been suffering from for a long time and with several linux distros. I've tried several solutions, the only remaining is zramswap and putting in an SSD with a big load of RAM. I tried with different IO schedulers  and setting noatime in fstab and that didnt help. Funny thing is that a friend of mine has a older laptop than me, and he dosen't suffer at all from this problem.\n\nA: OP has resolved issue by upgrading;\n\nThanks! this seems to be fixed in 3.2 and I can feel great performance\n  improvements. Try upgrading. Memory consumption is still awful\n  though..\n\n\nA: When you use zramswap, make sure you disable the swap on disk, or at least set it to a low priority ( add the pri=0 option in /etc/fstab ).  Any time things actually have to be swapped out to disk it is going to be SLOW.\n", "Q: Update Manager cannot find repos when upgrading to 11.10 I cannot seem to upgrade from 11.04 to Oneiric because:\nError during update\n\nA problem occurred during the update.

Each Job is defined in a Job configuration file.\n4.1.1   Job Types\n4.1.1.1   Task Job\nA Task Job is one which runs a short-running process, that is, a program which might still take a long time to run, but which has a definite lifetime and end state.\nFor example, deleting a file could be a Task Job since the command starts, deletes the file in question (which might take some time if the file is huge) and then the delete command ends.\n4.1.1.2   Service Job\nA Service Job is a long-running (or daemon(3) process). It is the opposite of a Task Job since a Service Job might never end of its own accord.\nExamples of Service Jobs are entities such as databases, webservers or ftp servers.\n4.1.1.3   Abstract Job\nThere is one other type of job which has no script sections or exec stanzas. Such abstract jobs can still be started and stopped, but will have no corresponding child process (PID). In fact, starting such a job will result in it \"running\" perpetually if not stopped by an Administrator. Abstract jobs exist only within Upstart itself but can be very useful. See for example:\nJobs that \"Run Forever\"\nSynchronisation\n", "Q: Xubuntu or Lubuntu on a Mac mini? My Mac mini doesn't have sufficient hardware for Ubuntu 11.04 (specifically Unity I think), and so I have to use the classic environment, which is fine, but it seems to run slower on 11.04 (I'm upgrading now to 11.10).\nHowever, I heard on PowerPCFAQ that if it runs slow I should use Xubuntu or Lubuntu. \nSo my question is: \n\n\n*\n\n*What is the best way to upgrade from Ubuntu 11.10 to Xubuntu or Lubuntu and which one would be better for a late 2005 model Mac Mini PPC?\n\n\nA: PowerPC packages don't show up on packages.ubuntu.com because PowerPC is not an official architecture.  You should look them up on launchpad.net instead where you will find them.  \nThere are PowerPC meta packages for xubuntu-desktop and lubuntu-desktop. There are instructions on how to install these derivatives already in the FAQ.  I know this because i wrote the thing!!!!  \nThe FAQ gives detailed instructions on how to install lubuntu/xubuntu from the minimal CDs plus it gives you the link to psychocats.net/ubuntu/xfce so that you could 'transform' Ubuntu into Xubuntu etc\nPowerPC has exactly the same packages in the repos as other architectures with the exception of chromium/chrome and a few others.\nPlease read the PowerPC Known Issues page before upgrading to 11.10 because it is a known issue to be left at a BusyBox prompt in 11.10.\n\nA: I warmly recommended either xubuntu or lubuntu, given that you are at v11.10 together with the age of your PC.\nLooking at packages.ubuntu.com, no PowerPC packages are described either for the xubuntu-desktop or lubuntu-desktop metapackages.  They have been subsequently released -  details of 11.10 PowerPC packages can be found on LaunchPad.net - for example the xubuntu-desktop package.\nSince these meta packages have been now pushed into the standard repositories you can install the xubuntu & lubuntu desktops via\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nLooking forward, it appears there will be a PowerPC ISO available for Lubuntu.  At the time of writing there doesnt appear to be an equivalent xubuntu PowerPC daily build though although this may change.  Please consult the PowerPC FAQ for more details.\nIf you want to give the daily build a test, remember to image your partitions first as per the dd answer as per the linked question.

One thing that is unique about this process is that I've been doing the exact same thing with every installation (installing the same software and configuring the same tweaks such as specific icons, cursors, themes, etc).\nInitially, I got tired of how long this process was (several hours), so I documented the procedure and the involved steps, which reduced the necessary time considerably.  However, I would like to simplify this even further by somehow incorporating the functions of imaging and redeploying.  I initially considered tools like ReMasterSys, UCK, etc, but these are all limited (particularly that they limit the user by only being able to create a single disc ISO, at least from what my research has shown).\nMy goal is that I could install and configure Ubuntu exactly the way I want it to be, and then somehow redeploy this perfected installation over and over again to other computers without any fuss.  Since my completed Ubuntu setup takes up much more space than a DVD, my plan would be to incorporate an external usb hard drive to help facilitate this \"redeploy\".  This is also why I named my question using \"unlimited iso\"; I wasn't sure if I could possibly convert the entire system to a very large ISO file (or some kind of image file) that could be read by another installer.  This ISO file could be 20GB+ in size, based on the files I've added/installed to the base machine.\nI hope the description of my goal hasn't been conveyed in a confusing way.  Again, in a nutshell, I'd like to setup an Ubuntu system, configure everything the way I want it, then \"snapshot\" this system and/or combine it with some kind of installer that can be used to redeploy this exact installation to other computers without any problems.  Is this possible?\n\nA: Try clonezilla or norton ghost. You can use this to make a 1-to-1 copy of an existing image/Installation and copy it to a portable hard drive; then your friends computer.\n", "Q: Can not save PDF file with inputs, error message \"Document is encrypted\" I have inserted inputs to a form given as a PDF file.

I often forget to back up my laptop. USB drive not connected, or doing something else, or....    So, I decided to synch to Ubuntu One.\nOn reading up, however, it looks like I want to go into Settings, enable backups, and backup once weekly to Ubuntu One. I did so, and am happily backing up - knowing I WILL toast a harddrive or decide to format and go again. So - deja-dup is for backups, and I do this in settings, and if my /home directory is bigger than 5 Gigs, I should pop for the 20 Gig increment? Or are backups priced differently?\nMy mobile phone does not have a data plan. I use it as an MP3 player, and manage it with Banshee. So I just use Banshee and a USB cord to sync music. My 5 Gigs and 1800 or so MP3's don't need to be synched. If I wanted to, though - I might consider synching my Documents and Pictures directories. But I'm not really synching to any other devices, so I'm really only keeping an online folder mirroring my laptop folders, right?\nSo, even if I'm only synching a Gig or so of data, I might need to pop for the 20 Gig increment if I want to backup my home directory weekly, right?\n\nA: Yeah, just to be clear, syncing is good for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quick access on other devices to the same files\n\n*Easy synchronization of changes to other devices\n\n*Disaster recovery if all you need is the latest version of the file\n\n\nBut it is not good for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rolling back to previous versions of the file\n\n*Getting the file back if you accidentally delete it\n\n\nAnd for backup, just flip the good/bad points.  It's bad for quick access, but good for disaster recovery where you need older versions.\nDeja Dup is makes it easy to backup all your application configuration.  Whereas with Ubuntu One, you'd have to mark a bunch of hidden folders as 'syncable'.  But that's a small point, since configuration is easily-reproduced if you had to.\n", "Q: appmenu for other window managers/desktops I'm looking for an AppMenu like this one for KDE to be used with GNOME or OpenBox or any other.\nIt provides a app menu in one button on the titlebar.\nI have tried using KDE window manager in GNOME not very good.\n\nA: For gnome-shell \nTo install appmenu in gnome shell add webupd8 ppa to the software sources \npress alt +cntrl  +t and type\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome3-globalmenu\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.webupd8.org/2011/11/install-gnome-shell-global-menu-in.html\n\n*https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/Whiteboards/AppMenu\n", "Q: Can a Unity Dash display be made persistent Is it possible to make a Dash display persistent ?. Often it is necessary to look at several of the listed results, when an item is selected the dash disappears and this requires repeating the dash search.\nFor example the unity-lens-books lens searches for ebooks found in a number of online sources (for me a very useful lens). Often one needs to look at several of the results to find what one is looking for. This requires the search to be repeated for every selected book which is an annoying waste of time.\n[Correction - I am wrong, the Book Lens does keep the search results between selections. I became confused over this because because when making a selection from a Dash lens, clicking the Dash icon again takes you to the \"home\" lens. However, the probem still applies to other lenses.]\nWould it not be better to make the Dash result a permanent display rather than an overlay.\n\nA: It is not currently possible, but it's obviously possible to develop it that way. I would file a feature-request bug on Launchpad.net. One way to accomplish your goal, would be if you had to press the Ubuntu button again to close it. I don't think that would disrupt anything and it shouldn't be too much work. The only issue I can see, is that it would make the Ubuntu button act differently from the other launchers. \n", "Q: List files that were changed between a certain datetime \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to remove files modified between particular dates? \n\nHow can I list all files recursively in a directory that were changed within a certain timespan?\nlike between 23.12.2011 and 25.12.2011 ?\n\nA: find some_dir -newermt '2011-12-23' -and -not -newermt '2011-12-25'\n\nThis includes files modified on 2011-12-23 but not files modified on 2011-12-25.

I often come back to find that it stopped somewhere waiting for user input when there is a problem with a particular file (Cancel, Skip, Skip All or whatever).  I could of course just wait for the first error and select 'Skip All' but that is a very bad solution - no logging, have to wait.  \nI am doing this in Nautilus.  \nI know there has to be a better way(s) to do this.  I would like to be able to automatically skip all the problematic files and generate a log file that would tell me what files weren't moved and what the problem with each of those files was.  \nIs there a tool or script that will do this?\n\nA: Have you tried rsync?\nIt's a command-line utility so it's not as user-friendly as Nautilus, but the command line is the best for automating stuff like you want. rsync will indeed try to transfer as much as possible, it will log all errors, and since it only transmits the \"differences\" or changes, it's \"cheap\" to just rerun it to bring things back up to sync.\nOther than rsync, you need to install openssh-server on the receiving computer(s), then do something like this:\nrsync -avu --progress source_folder remote-computer.local:Desktop/\n\nthe folder will be sent to remote-computer and placed on the Desktop.\nInstead of remote-computer.local, you can use an IP address if you know the IP of the destination system, but by default the .local domain should work, so if a computer's hostname is \"buckaroo\", you can just specify it as buckaroo.local.\n", "Q: How to make workplace selector 2x2 instead of 4x1?

I got a 2D desktop running under the open source video driver called Nouveau.\nIn 12.04 System Info is called Details. The details of my graphic set up under Nouveau are:\n\nGraphics: VESA:GT216 Board-0682vb12\nDriver: 0682vb12 Experience:\nStandard\n\nNotice, that the graphic experience is listed as standard. This means 2D. In 12.04 you can confirm this by running System Settings>Appearence. If you see a method of adjusting the Launcher icon size, then you are in 3D. You do not get (at present) a method to adjust the Launcher icon size in 2D.\nWhen I re-activate the Nvidia driver, Details (System Info) says:\n\nGraphics: Unknown\nDriver: Unknown\nExperience: standard\n\nThe experience is standard even though I know I am in 3D mode. I can see the effects. Therefore I conclude that System Info at present cannot get information from a proprietary video driver because it is closed source code.\nFor your information, the video card that you have is a key component for having a good visual experience in any operating system.\nYou do not give us your hardware specifications. Does your video card have a powerful GPU (Graphic Processing Unit)? How much video memory is on the card itself? This can make all the difference to a user's visual experience.\n\nA: Had a similar problem, found by adding this repo and updating my NVidia drivers worked for me: http://mygeekopinions.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/how-to-install-nvidia-2750907-driver-in.html\n", "Q: How to set Google Chrome as the default browser? How can I set Google Chrome as the default browser? If I set it in the browser settings, nothing happens. The browser says it's default, but in preferred applications in Gnome, there's only Firefox to choose from. Clicking any link i.e in Thunderbird opens a blank Firefox window, not with the link embedded. Can I set the  default browser in dconf2 or any configuration file?\n\nA: Assuming you are using Unity, click on the dash button in the launcher and search for 'System info'. Then, open 'System info' and move to 'Default applications' section. Then, click on the dropdown list next to Web. There, select 'Google Chrome' and it will be selected as the default web browser for your system. \n\n\nA: You should have in the ~/.config/mimeapps.list file the following lines:\ntext/html=google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/http=google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/https=google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/about=google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/unknown=google-chrome.desktop\n\nMake sure these lines are under either the [Default Applications] or [Added Associations] section.\nAnd of course, you need google-chrome installed such that google-chrome.desktop is either located at /usr/share/applications/, /usr/local/share/applications/ or ~/.local/share/applications/.\n\nA: There are also the /etc/alternatives/ where you have links:\n\n\n*\n\n*gnome-www-browser ->\n\n*x-www-browser ->\n\n\nIn my case Lotus Notes opened wrong browser using the link gnome-www-browser.\n\nA: Alternatively, you can do the following instead of editing mimeapps.list:\nxdg-mime default google-chrome.desktop text/html\nxdg-mime default google-chrome.desktop x-scheme-handler/http\nxdg-mime default google-chrome.desktop x-scheme-handler/https\nxdg-mime default google-chrome.desktop x-scheme-handler/about\n\nTo check the current settings, you can use:\nxdg-mime query default text/html\nxdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/http\nxdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/https\nxdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/about\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04 and later select Settings -> Details -> Default Applications.\n \n\nA: For Kubuntu 20.04 with Plasma, you can do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Application Launcher\"\n\n*Type \"Default Applications\" into the searchbox\n\n*You should see a system settings module with a star as an icon. It should actually says \"Default Applications\". Select it and open it\n\n*Select the option \"Web Browser\" and from there just choose \"Google Chrome\" as the default app for opening http and https URLs\n\n*Click \"Apply\" in order to save the settings\n\nSee the preview at the following screenshot of the default applications utility.\nAlternatively, you can do this from the \"System Settings > Applications (under Personalization) > Default Applications\"\n\nA: There are a number of places an application might figure out which browser to launch and unfortunately there is no established standard. If the other answers don't work for you (as was the case for me with Skype) you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*the $BROWSER environment variable\n\n*/usr/bin/x-www-browser, which is configured via the alternatives mechanism: sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser (which is what Skype is launching it seems)\n\n", "Q: How to install Beatbox?

I ran across a couple of Ebay sellers that are selling Ubuntu. I thought that was prohibited?\nDo you think that this is a fake Ubuntu with viruses?\n\nA: Why would that be prohibited? You are free to sell Ubuntu as much as you like. It's free software, after all. I don't really understand why you would want to buy it from a third-party, though. But it's perfectly legal. You can purchase official CDs from http://shop.ubuntu.com if you want to. \nIt's impossible to tell whether it's the official version they're selling or not, and if not, what they've done to it. However, if they claim that it is the official version, it's extremely easy to check. You'll just check the contents against the md5 sums available from official channels. \nIf you have an ok internet connection, I would rather just download it myself. \n\nA: Ubuntu is free software mainly under GPL license; so everyone's free to sell if they want to. But Ubuntu name and logo are registered trademarks of Canonical Ltd. (look at the footer of this page!) so Canonical could take action if they want to.\n", "Q: Blocked port 5000?

The command make uninstall didn't work (there is no makefile as it is just a script). So I decided to remove the file manually. But there were a lot of files.\nI've tried some things but it didn't work. So I came here to ask for some advice.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a command with ls -R | grep blabla* that I can add to display file directory (it only displays filename)\n\n*Is there a true ls -R | grep bla* | rm ?\n\n\nA: If 'aname' shall be the starting part of the filename, it would be, from the current directory:\nfind -name \"aname\" -delete \n\nBtw.: \ngrep \"bla\"* somewhere\n\nis almost always false, since grep already makes partial matches, which means, it finds bla, blafasel and xybla with simply \ngrep bla somewhere\n\nDeleted older part of answer, because of misunderstanding:\nFrom the current directory, if you look for the word 'aname' in all files, you can just use:\nfind -exec grep \"aname\" {} \";\" -delete \n\n\n\nA: What you are looking for is a combination of xargs, find, and rm.\nfind will make a list of all the files matching your conditions, and then write them (null terminated) to stdout, which will be piped to xargs. xargs will take the null terminated strings and use them as arguments to rm.\nfind -L /path/to/dir -name \"*name*\" -print0 |xargs -0 -r  rm\n\nsource: http://linuxcommando.blogspot.com/2007/10/find-xargs-pipe.html\n\nA: In-between the other answers: you can invoke rm without without needing the xargs program.  In fact you can usually use the exec option to find instead of xargs.\nTo invoke rm as few times as possible, on big batches of files:\nfind /path/to/dir -name \"*name*\" -exec rm {} +\n\nTo invoke rm once for each file:\nfind /path/to/dir -name \"*name*\" -exec rm {} \";\"\n\nThere are also more-elaborate options to find that will change to the directory before executing the command.\n", "Q: How To Set Nvidia Overscan To Persistent After Reboot? Stats of what I'm running:\nTV:  HP MediaSmart TV 47\" / OS:  Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit / Video Card:  Nvidia GeForce GT 220 / Video Driver:  Nvidia 260.19.06\nWhen I first setup Ubuntu on this computer, after rebooting, the display resolution did not save.  I eventually fixed this by manually changing the display to the correct resolution in the xorg.conf file.  But I'm still unable to make the overscan setting persist after a reboot.  I've tried adding nvidia-settings -l to my autostart, but this does nothing.  I've also run the Nvidia Settings app with sudo and saved the changes, but this hasn't fixed the issue either.  I also noticed that there is a .nvidia-settings-rc file in my home directory that stores settings and there is a field HTPC64:0.0/OverscanCompensation[DFP-1]=115 which IS correct, but this file and/or settings related to it don't seem to be saving because I still have to manually adjust the overscan in the Nvidia Settings after a reboot.  What else can I do to resolve this?\n\nA: I hope this isn't too late. I ran across your question as I was having the same issue.\nOpen the nvidia-settings program. Set the overscan and various other goodies to your liking, then on the \"nvidia-settings configuration\" option in the left hand combo box, click on \"Save Current Configuration\" leave the default as ~/.nvidia-settings-rc.\nThen open your ~/.xinitrc file, and add nvidia-settings -l to any line before the exec ... line or if/case structure containing it that points to your display manager of choice.\nIf you're unsure, somewhere near the top should suffice.\n\nA: On the latest driver, I had to use the GUI to setup my overscan in advanced mode\n\nThen I had to save the conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nThen I had to copy the value of the meta mode, and write a script that does this:\nnvidia_tv_overscan_fix.sh\n# You can do this with a GUI now, from nvidia\nnvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=\"DVI-D-0: nvidia-auto-select +0+720, HDMI-0: 1280x720 +0+0 {viewportin=1280x720, viewportout=1205x680+35+20}\"\n\nAnd run that on startup\n", "Q: Which hardware upgrade will give me the greatest performance boost with Ubuntu 11.10(with list of currently installed hardware)?

It just seems a little clunky. Which hardware upgrade would give me greatest performance boost in Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: You might want to add an SSD for your root partition , it could speed up your booting process at least.\nSSD on Wikipedia\nI don't know how much GPU can affect video performance ,  i never tried on my laptop.\n", "Q: unity slow with dual-monitor With single-screen, Unity is fast in opening apps, switching between opened apps, etc.\nWhen I use dual-monitor then i see considerable drop in performance in the above mentioned areas. Overall system performance comes down to a crawl. I opened the same apps when using both single and dual-monitor. Is it a know bug? I'm on 11.10.\n\nA: If your laptop has an Intel N10 graphics chip, it may be this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/830949. \nIf so, an easy way to test is to lower the resolution of the external display until the sum of horizontal resolutions totals less than 2048. \nIf it turns out to be that problem, you have several options. One is to arrange the screens vertically rather than horizontally (the idea is that everything must fit in a 2048x2048 matrix, so as long as your monitors don't add up to more than 2048 in either direction you should be fine.\nThe second option is to use Unity2d, which doesn't trigger this bug.\n\nA: I've had this issue with ATI Radeon X2100. Slow performance was with Unity in general, not only 3D. However GNOME did't work much faster anyway. After few other bugs I've changed to 10.04 LTS and there are no problems.\n\nA: Try the below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia X server settings \n\n*PRIME Profiles \n\n*Intel (Power savings mode) \n\n*Log out then back in.\n\n\nThis fixed the multimonitor issue where the second display was being slow. This worked because the Nvidia driver assumed I had a single monitor. The refresh rates were therefore out of sync with the hardware and this resulted in visible lag.\nBear in mind this will only work if Nvidia X server settings is reporting only one monitor, if it detects both correctly then it may be something else.\n", "Q: sudo apt-get install -f doesn't fix broken packages.

I don't know how to fix this, and it's more than a little frustrating.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Newer Android devices (as of 3.0 Honeycomb) no longer support USB Mass Storage for the internal storage, because that allows Android to not have to support the FAT32 file system.  In order to connect to a 3.0 or later device over USB you'll need to use something that speaks MTP; there are a few applications for Linux which do so such as aafm or gmtp.  I have had the most success using mtpfs, although it's not really that user-friendly to work with.\nYou can also try one of the many ftp/scp/bluetooth file transfer tools for Android and see if that does what you need.  Astro has a few file transfer plugins available, and there's also several FTP clients and servers as well.

I've Ubuntu 11.10 with LibreOffice 3.4.4 installed. But, I heard that is a newer version of LibreOffice 3.4.5.\nHow can I update to this version?\n\nA: By installing Ubuntu you will have realised that you do not only get an OS but also preinstalled software like LibreOffice. Most other Open Source software is also available through the Software Center in case it is not installed already.\nThis has the following advantages for you\n\n\n*\n\n*you have free access to Software tested to run.\n\n*security updates will instantaneously be provided not only for the OS but also for your software.\n\n*when upgrading to a new release of Ubuntu all your software will also be upgraded.\n\n\nNew software versions need testing for compatibility with Ubuntu. Therefore new program versions will not appear until the next release of Ubuntu. This will be every 6 months. So what you usually do is to just wait until the next release to see that all of your software will be upgraded as well without you having to do anything further.\nOnly very rarely there is a need for an interim software upgrade (e.g. your program gets new features that you can't wait for or has a bug that is not a security issue).\nIn case you are new to Ubuntu I recommend to not upgrade software from other sources than the official repositories in the Software Center until you are familiar with the way we do it here. Even later it is always wise to wait with upgrades until it is clear they have no bugs and will perform nice. If you follow this advice you will be rewarded with a fairly stable system (that however may not always have all brand new features included yet).\nLibreOffice 3.5.x will be included in the next release of Ubuntu 12.04 that comes to you in April 2012.\nYou are most welcome to install untested or beta software to help finding bugs and thus contribute to make Ubuntu better. This is very easy to do - but it will always be at the cost of stability.\n\nA: LibreOffice 3.4.5 is planned to be updated on 11.10, see bug 915223. However it might take some time: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates.\nA prerelease containing LibreOffice 3.4.5 has been uploaded to https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa.\n\nA: in my case LO 3.3.4, which is not in the Ubuntu repos and can be downloaded from LO's site here, works much better than the default 3.4.4 that comes with Ubuntu 11.10. LO 3.4.4 and 3.4.5 and 3.5beta crashed more than I could bare.

Network connections in Ubuntu are either configured for the computer, or by the individual user through Network Manager (that little network icon in your notification area). Servers are generally configured system-wide from /etc, while desktops are configured by Network Manager.\nIf it's a system-wide configuration, you can parse /etc/network/interfaces.\nIf the network was configured by Network Manager on the desktop, you can interface with it.

Plus you're going to need a spare partition or disk.\nTo start with, backup all your data on both systems.  Accidents happen easily.  Clonezilla is good for making copies of everything such that you can put it all back if you wipe out your disk.\nSo, find a USB drive, or disk partition with enough space to hold your wubi install.  Then follow the manual instructions at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1519354 to move your wubi install to that space.  Read carefully and make sure you understand how it all works before trying it.\nOnce you have your install migrated into the clear, the simplest thing to do is to fire up Clonezilla ( http://clonezilla.org ) and make an image of it.  You want just the Ubuntu install, not the Windows install too.  Then fire up Virtual Box with Clonezilla.  Put the image in a Windows shared folder and configure Virtual Box's network settings so that you can access it.  You should then be able to tell Clonezilla to connect to the share, and restore the image to the virtual machine.\nPersonally I've only ever done it this way once.  It's a pain, and not worth it.  \nEasier way:  Do a clean install into Virtual Box, then fire up your wubi install.  Log out of the graphical shell and hit ctrl+alt+F1 to get a terminal prompt.  Log in to the terminal and cd to /home.  make a tarball of the user home folders with tar, and save it to your windows system, which will be mounted under /host.  (There are plenty of good sets of instructions on using tar elsewhere, so I'll just say tar --help for the rundown on the options)\nI usually do the same thing with the contents of /var/cache/apt to save redownloading updates to the new system.\nThen, go back to Windows, fire up Virtual Box, put the tarballs in a shared folder where you can get to them from the VM, and expand the tarballs back out into the directories from whence they came.  That will get all your personal settings and the packages for all the programs you had installed, so you have essentially the same install, only with fewer reboots and much less chance of accidentally nuking your disk.\n\nA: Yes this is possible. For that you need\n\n\n*\n\n*iso file that you want to install\n\n*Virtual Box Soft\n\n\nThis process is very easy. Go through this link:\nInstalling Ubuntu in Virtual Box.\n", "Q: How can I make pbuilder use my apt-cacher-ng instance? I have a apt-cacher-ng server on my LAN network, and I was wondering how I could \"force\" pbuilder to use it (to speed up package builds).\nTypical setup client-side of the cache goes something like this:\nIn /etc/apt/apt.conf:\nAcquire::http { Proxy \"http://servername:3142\"; };\n\nA: Like this:\n$ sudo pbuilder --login --save-after-login\n# echo 'Acquire::http { Proxy \"http://servername:3142\"; };' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02proxy\n# exit\n$\n\nAlternatively, you could use the --execute option:\n$ sudo pbuilder --execute --save-after-exec -- /tmp/setup-apt-proxy.sh\n\n... where /tmp/setup-apt-proxy.sh contains commands to create /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02proxy.\n\nA: If you set export http_proxy=http://your-proxy:8080/ in ~/.pbuilderrc it will use that proxy for the package downloads.\nI just tried it on my setup, and it worked. As best I could tell from the internet traffic, I didn't have to download anything while running pbuilder create.\nThe nice thing is that this way also works when you are creating the tarball, not just after you create it and then modify it.\n\nA: I used the --mirror argument, eg:\nsudo pbuilder create --debootstrapopts --variant=buildd --configfile ~/.pbuilderrc --mirror http://localhost:3142/us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ main restricted universe multiverse\n\nverify the caching hits on the proxy:\n$ tail -f  /var/log/apt-cacher/access.log \nThu Dec 19 19:16:33 2013|26140|::ffff:127.0.0.1|HIT|1272844|us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_main_binary-amd64_Packages.bz2\nThu Dec 19 19:18:45 2013|26647|::ffff:127.0.0.1|HIT|49563|us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_Release\nThu Dec 19 19:18:45 2013|26663|::ffff:127.0.0.1|HIT|198|us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_Release.gpg\nThu Dec 19 19:18:46 2013|26707|::ffff:127.0.0.1|HIT|1272844|us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_main_binary-amd64_Packages.bz2\n\n", "Q: right-click on Xubuntu home screen is slow, is it normal? When i right-click on desktop or home screen of Xubuntu, i see considerable delay before the menu appears. Is it normal? Can this be tweaked to bring down the delay like that of other Ubuntu distros or for that matter to Ubuntu's right-click.\n\nA: This seems to be related to application icons.\nIn Settings -> Desktop, go to the Menus tab, and unselect 'Show application icons in menu' under Desktop Menu.\nThis should instantly speed it up - you can toggle the setting back and forth and it changes in realtime to compare. I used to have this issue but after unticking it the menu appears instantly if you can live without the icons. They could do with caching them or something I guess.\nIncidentally this doesn't affect the Applications menu on the panel. If you use that to launch stuff you could just turn off the entire Applications menu in the desktop menu to achieve the same speedup.\n\nA: It's normal for the right-click menu to come up slow the first time, but it should be much faster the next time. Until the next computer restart, it should be fast each time after that first time. It is similar to the slowness of Thunar the the first time it is brought up, but responds quickly after that.\n", "Q: Installation stuck at welcome screen I decided to switch from Windows to Ubuntu.

I can mount my vmdk to a folder using vmware-mount (I have vmware server), but how do I go about mounting it to /home on startup?\n\nA: Make the command you use to mount your disk, part of a bash script named say, customMount.sh. An example of such a script is:\n#!/bin/bash\n# File: customMount.sh\n# Description: Mounts a partition on startup\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /home\n\nAbove script will mount /dev/sda1 (first physical partition on sda) to /home.

Also, sorry for my poor english, it isn't my native language.\nThanks in advance for your assistance.\n\nA: There's one of two things going on here:\n\n\n*\n\n*The RAID used in Windows was built by Windows storage manager and is thus software RAID specific to that OS. It is not transferable to other operating systems.\n\n*The RAID was configured in the BIOS, that's \"fake RAID\", and you simply haven't identified the proper RAID driver yet for Linux (or it doesn't exist) to be able to assemble the array.\nIt's up to you to drill down into the details and deploy the proper solution. Ideally, you would use a HW RAID controller that abstracted all this away for you.\nWorst case, you use \"Fake RAID\", which is really just platform independent software RAID, to be able to share the RAID sets between Windows in Linux.\nIf it were me, and all I had was \"Fake RAID\", I wouldn't even bother. My data integrity is more important to me then sharing data between two OS. Furthermore, NTFS isn't fully supported on Linux, reading is OK, but if you start writing to that array you can destroy the data.\n", "Q: Where can I find Gnome-Classic themes?

I've done some research on mounting it from a Live CD, but it seems to be read only.\nIs there a way to force it to skip that file or to mount the file system in read/write mode?\n\nA: \"That file\" (~/.pam_environment) is unavailable until you mount and decrypt you8r home directory!  \nOnce you've booted a Live CD, you can gain read/write access with mount -o remount,rw <device> command, then follow these instructions.\n", "Q: Streaming in justin.tv using Ubuntu 11.10 I used to streaming videos in justin.tv..using Windows 7 and I had no problems.  But a month ago, I installed Ubuntu 11.10 (32 bits) in my notebook and now I can't streaming videos.\nThe problem is that when I click on the button \"Go Live!\", it´s supposed that the screen where I have to clic on \"Allow\" it should appear, but it doesn't. The web only displays the message: \"You can't start until you click allow below.\", but the \"allow button\" doesn't appear, instead of that I only see a black screen.\nI guessed that it was a problem with the Adobe Flash Player, but I have the lastest version for Linux installed and I have no problems with Youtube.

The solution is to allow permissions in flash for justin.tv's sites.  You can find the settings here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html\nYou'll have to set all relevant sites to 'Always Allow'.

Also, don't forget to restart your browser.\nOne last thing, I did notice that it didn't keep my changes unless I toggled to a different tab.  Not sure why but there is no 'save' button so perhaps the trigger to save the changes is switching tabs.  Best of luck!\n", "Q: Equivalent of yum distro-sync? In redhat-based distros, the yum tool has a distro-sync command which will synchronize packages to the current repositories.  This command is useful for returning to a base state if base packages have been modified from an outside source.  The docs for the command is:\n\ndistribution-synchronization or distro-sync \n  Synchronizes the installed package set with the latest packages available, this is done\n  by either obsoleting, upgrading or downgrading as appropriate. This\n  will \"normally\" do the same thing as the upgrade command however if\n  you have the package FOO installed at version 4, and the latest\n  available is only version 3, then this command will downgrade FOO to\n  version 3.\n\nIs there an equivalent operation in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I think you can do this by a adding a /etc/apt/preferences\nprofile that pinned all packages to the distro/release that\nrepo represents. The next time you run apt-get upgrade it\nwill downgrade as necessary to satisfy the rules specified.\nSee man apt_preferences for details.\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences\nThe flip side of this is to prevent this from occurring to\nbegin with by pinning the packages you have a stake in\nstaying stable. So if they're updated by an outside source,\nthe next apt-get upgrade will revert just that and not your\nentire OS.\n\nA: No, there is no such command in the apt package system, for what I know.\nThe dist-upgrade command of apt-get is similar, but it do not downgrade packages. The install command could downgrade a package as in\nsudo apt-get install \"package\"=\"version\"\n\nbut as you see you should explicitly give the desired version number, which you can retrieve from\napt-cache policy \"package\"\n\n", "Q: How to disable the touchpad on a Dell Inspiron 5040 I have a Dell Inspiron 5040,\nand I cannot disable the touchpad.\nThe best solution would be if Ubuntu could actually not ignore the keyboard shortcut that disables it.\n\nA: Nothing did the trick for me, so I made the following little script that works:\n!/bin/sh \ntouchpad_id=xinput list | grep PS/2 | cut -f 2 | cut -d \"=\" -f 2 \nxinput set-prop $touchpad_id \"Device Enabled\" $1 \n\nA: Well i am not sure if this program could help you but there are a some options to disable the touchpad.\nThe first option is installing Jupiter, this program is pretty usefull and has other funtions like change the performance modes and obviously disable the touchapad, to install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nOther option is install an applet that disable the touchpad, this is an applet that disable the touchpad:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:lorenzo-carbonell/atareao\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install touchpad-indicator\n\n\nA: terminal or with ALT+F2 run synclient TouchpadOff=1\n", "Q: Sharing sub-folders as well I am new to ubuntu, I have ubuntu 10.04 and want to share the video\\music files with my xtremer.

Why there is no easy way to install new themes in ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 in both unity and gnome 3 ?\n\nA: You might be referring to Gnome Shell, but if you're talking about window decorators and the contents of windows, then Unity and Gnome Shell aren't relevant. They're both Gnome 3. \nThe reason is that lots of the infrastructure has been replaced. Old Gnome themes are no longer compatible. That means it'll take a little while for new themes to become available to install. The configuration system has also been replaced, so the graphical tools to do these things must also be replaced. Since there's relatively few themes to choose between, that task probably hasn't had the highest priority. It'll improve. :)\nI would expect to install themes from the software centre, like any other software.

(e.g. is there an upper limit to how many cores Ubuntu can handle out-of-the-box?)\n\nA: Basically, this comes down to \"can the Linux kernel handle this many cores\". The actual number of cores supported is defined by a numerical option that can be set at kernel compile time. The kernel configuration shipped by Ubuntu can be seen here, and in that file, we find\nCONFIG_NR_CPUS=256\n\nso 64 should work fine.

I don't want to touch or modify this drive.\nThe 500GB RAID1 drive had one partition: 1 primary NTFS partition for storage of stuff I want to access from Windows, and then about 200GB of unallocated space.\nI ran the 11.10 installer, selected the \"just install the stuff\" option (the first one, I forget what it's called), and it installed it in the unallocated space, creating two primary partitions: one ~200GB ext4 partition for Ubuntu itself and another 12GB primary partition for the swap file (same size as RAM I have).\nProblem is that Grub didn't install to the MBR on the boot disk (the SSD) so I have no way of starting Ubuntu that doesn't involve BIOS shenanigans. I am kind of apprehensive about manually installing Grub into the MBR of the boot disk myself so any guidance regarding if that's even what I need to do would be great.\nFYI, I tried re-installing specifying everything manually, including setting the ~200GB ext4 partition to be the / mount point and telling the installer to install the bootloader on /dev/sda1 (I think, perhaps is was /dev/sda, I forget, exactly), and that didn't work, either.\n\nA: I recommend you install GRUB into the Master Boot Record of the second hard disk you are installing Ubuntu on and configure your bios to boot that hard drive first, GRUB will detect your Windows install on the SSD and include it allowing you to choose either operating system on start up.\nWhen you install ubuntu ensure you select /dev/sdb as the destination for GRUB.\n\nA: Okay, so I found this program, EasyBCD, which will sort out the problem for you.

Example:\nHere's a comparison, LibreOffice on top and Inkscape below.\n\nAs you can see, LibreOffice messes up the kerning. The font is Ubuntu, 10pt in LibreOffice and Ubuntu, 13px in Inkscape.\nThe kerning problem gets less if I increase the font-size btw.\nIs there a switch for activating the kerning in LibreOffice or is this a known problem?\n\nA: Do a \"Select All\" before you turn kerning on. Otherwise it will apply only to a local selection, possible the current paragraph.  \n(I am using up to date libreoffice on a Mac, but this should still apply.)\n\nA: There are two types of kerning out there.  The old style involves pairs of letters while the new style, GPOS kerning, supports pairing groups of letters. Adobe FontCreator and others now use GPOS and GSUB rather than the \"legacy\" kern table method.\nThe Linux Libertine font project (Wikipedia's font of choice) discusses kerning:\n\nNearly any good font contains kerning information, but how much time and effort the designer had spent on this feature is quite different. Until the late 1990s, the kerning information was defined in a long table pair by pair. Since OpenType there is the GPOS Kerning method, which allows a group by group approach. This is a much more elegant solution, because modern fonts with more than 2000 characters would otherwise contain thousands of entries.\n\nThe problem is that GPOS support is very rare.  OpenOffice bug 31764 and LibreOffice bug 46055 both request GPOS kerning support and neither seems to have much attention.\n2017 Update: LO resolved this in 2016/11.

Or people just don't bother creating them for Linux? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDo I need to have 'antivirus software' installed? \n\nI've never used Linux before and I heard that you don't need to worry about malware on Linux. So, as the title said, is Linux really malware safe ? Or do people just not bother creating them for Linux because Linux is not popular for standard end-users ?\n\nA: Linux uses  root access to to control what changes are made to the system and keep the system safe.. This means that any given user can't make administrative changes that affect the whole system and allow the virus to propagate and deliver payloads. On some Linux distributions other then Ubuntu, you have to log off and then log back in as the root account to make system-wide changes. This got very annoying to the user, having to log out and log back in all the time, and it was a security flaw because if someone knew the root password they could do anything. So, as a result, many people stayed logged on as root and used it as their account for daily work. Then, when a virus came along, it was not a good day for them.\nUbuntu handles this problem by disabling the option to login as root by default at the login screen, eliminating the security risk. Then, to make any system-wide changes you temporarily switch to the root account using the sudo command, do what you need to get done, and get back. This is a lot more secure way to handle it and much less annoying to the endi user. If you want to enable the root account for some reason, you can do so by running sudo -i and sudo passwd root and setting a password for the root account, if you prefer handling administrative tasks this way.\nPeople are a lot less likely to write viruses for Linux for this reason. If they know that it won't have as much effect, they are more likely to spend their time targeting a different operating system. Linux is also a lot harder to write software for and less popular then windows, and hackers tend to pick the platform where their virus will propagate and have the most effect. All software that goes into the Software Center is screened, so you can download from there knowing it will be safe. Be careful when adding third-party software sources to your system and installing packages from places other then the software center that you don't know much about. Use clam-av as a free antivirus scanner to scan for the few viruses that may be out there. Keep your root account disabled unless you have to enable it for some reason.  Update frequently through the Update Manager to ensure you stay up to date with all security updates installed. By following these steps, you are a lot less likely target for an infection then a Windows or Mac user. \n\nA: There are loads and loads and loads of Malware for Linux systems too, maybe just not the very same type of Malware that Windows desktop OS is affected by. Its very important to try to understand security with any operating system you use, to properly apply security patches from your vendor/distribution, to be careful with what and how you do things. Its not much different on Linux than on other systems really.\nThere are lots of automated malware (worms) that scan around for known unpatched vulnerabilities, infect the Linux servers with something, reports home and starts scanning from there too. These \"botnets\" are later used for everything from DDoS to information theft to spam and everything in between.\nSo it might be a little bit different, but you sure have to worry still! :)\n", "Q: How do I get the battery indicator to indicate total remaining power if I have 2 batteries? I'm having a little bit of trouble with my battery indicator. I'm using a laptop that has 2 batteries (One standard and one bay battery).

Im trying to find the most suitable driver for my network USB device in Ubuntu 11.10. First, where can I check the driver that ubuntu is using to control this device? It appears as interface wireless (wlan1) in Network Tools, but apart from the MAC address and some statistics about data transmission, there's no info about the driver.\nI'd already installed aircrack-ng, which provides several options to scan networks. Running airmon-ng start wlan1in terminal I get the following:\nInterface   Chipset     Driver\n\neth1        Unknown         wl\n\nwlan1       Unknown     rt2800usb - [phy2]\n                                    (monitor mode enabled on mon0)\n\nThe wireless adapter is TP-LINK model TL-WN7200ND, and the wireless panel reads it as a RaLink adapter. Seems that rt2800usb is the driver for the adapter, but is there anything more powerful for this device??\n\nA: You can get a lot of cool information by poking around /sys. /sys/class has entries for every class of device your linux install is equipped to handle. The driver info is found at this path:\n$ ls /sys/class/net/wlan0/device/driver/module/drivers\npci:ath5k@\n\nMy wifi card, named wlan0, is using the ath5k driver. Here's the driver info for one of my ethernet cards:\n$ ls /sys/class/net/eth1/device/driver/module/drivers\npci:forcedeth@\n\nAs an aside, Ubuntu (like most linux distros) includes device drivers as kernel modules. The kernel is the big piece of software that runs your computer hardware. Ubuntu loads modules for your hardware based on what it senses you have. You can get a list of loaded modules by running this command: lsmod. Here's a snippet of my lsmod output:\nbluetooth             130968  0 \nath5k                 127724  0 \nath                    11990  1 ath5k\neeepc_laptop           12412  0 \nsparse_keymap           2660  1 eeepc_laptop\nmac80211              196283  1 ath5k\npci_hotplug            22072  1 eeepc_laptop\ncfg80211              142540  3 ath5k,ath,mac80211\nrfkill                 12470  3 bluetooth,eeepc_laptop,cfg80211\ncrc16                   1091  2 bluetooth,ext4\n\nThe left column is a list of loaded modules, the right-most column shows what modules they in turn use. As you can see, these all use or are related to the ath5k module.\n\nA: if Ubuntu found a driver and you can surf the net, I do not think you should change it. To find out the driver in use, see the post of djeikyb or, see below.\nIf Ubuntu did not find a driver, you should first let Ubuntu search for it. For this you launch the \"System Settings\" and start \"Hardware Drivers\". This does the job. This method is also the easy way to see the currently used (proprietary) drivers.\nThe hard way is to identify the chipset of your USB-WiFi and search with this information\nFor this you need to issue the command \"lsusb\". Open the gnome terminal and type \"lsusb\", without quotes. You shoud see something like this:\n$ Bus 002 Device 003: ID 064e:a103 Suyin Corp. Acer/HP Integrated Webcam [CN0314]\n\nThis is my Webcam, my WiFi-Card can be identified by \"lspci\".\nBased upon the information (according to the example above: vendor 064e - Suyin Corp. and product a103 - Acer/HP Integrated Webcam) you should be able to search precisely for the needed driver.\n", "Q: Why doesn't changing a variable in a script alter it outside the script? Let's say I export a variable with the terminal. After that I call a script that alters that variable to something else. But when I return to the terminal and echo the variable, it remains as its original value.\nWhat can I do if I want like the variable to be changed and visible outside the script, not only there in the script.

It sets the permissions of everything, including the sub-directories to 777. However, if you then decided that you didn't want to do that, and run\nchmod 644 *\n\nNow the contents of the sub-directories get set unknown permissions and you cannot change them back.\nWhy does that happen? Is this the expected behavior, or a bug? Is there a way to restore the file permissions?\nSince the files I had were in a zip file in another location, I just deleted the entire directory, and unzipped the zip file again, but I would like to know the causes of this \"problem\", and it's remedies.\nSome additional info, I am running those command on a remote machine over SSH.\n\nA: Probably best to use find for this sort of thing.\nDirectories need to be x access , files do not, so different set of permissions.\n# Files\nfind . -type f -exec chmod 644 '{}' \\;\n\n# Directories\nfind . -type d -exec chmod 755 '{}' \\;\n\n\nA: The way the permission bits are interpreted differ for files and directories. Read info coreutils 'File permissions' and man 2 chmod for details. Why would one want to make everything readable,writeable,executable for owner,group and world?  \nSince the evidence is gone, I can only guess that after your chmod, you'd lost write access to ., the current directory. This can be fixed by:  \nchmod u+w  $PWD \nThen, you can change the mode (permissions) of files in $PWD \nBy doing the chmod 644 *, you also removed the execute permission from any of the files that had it, so they're no longer executable by any of owner,group,world.\n\nA: When you want to set permissions to directories and sub-directories you should use:\nchmod -R\n\n-R, --recursive         change files and directories recursively\n\nA: I found the solution to the problem I had.\nFirst of all, thanks to all of you who posted, your answers were indeed helpful.\nThe problem is that assigning permission 664 to all the files in the current directory:\nchmod 644 *\n\nremoves the execute permissions on directories, which need execute permissions in order to work properly. The solution is quite simple. We just need to change the permissions for the directories like this:\nchmod 744 dir_name\n\nWhere dir_name is, of course, the name of our directory. Once we do that, everything goes back to normal.\n", "Q: Cannot access resources on VPN network I managed to connect from outside to the corporate network using VPN (OpenVPN plugin of the network-manager).

I got the wireless working (which wasn't a big deal) and now I am working on the video config.  The video card is an ati x1150 Right now it seems to be using the gallium 3d driver version 0.3 i think and its working pretty well but I have noticed some sluggishness in the video.  I was looking through some other posts about the possibility of using fglrx on this system.\nJockey not detecting my ATI IGP Xpress 1150\nIs it possible to install older catalyst versions through jockey?  \nbut it seems that its either not possible or not recommended so my question is this.  Would it be worth my time to try to install say catalyst 9.2 (i believe this is the last version to officially support my card) or should I stick with gallium?  If I should stick with the gallium then is there anywhere I can get an update to it that will (hopefully) fix some of the lag?  Would the x update or xorg edgers ppa have the update?  Thank you for taking the time to try and help.\n\nA: According to the supported hardware table the ATI driver you should be using is already installed and used by default in Ubuntu 11.10.\nYour card, the ATI X1150 uses the RS400 chipset, which according to the table, is supported by the catalyst legacy or open-source drivers.\nSince the first cannot be installed in Ubuntu 11.10 unless you are able to install and use a kernel version 2.6.28 (or earlier) you are only able to use the second and that is already installed in your system.\n\nA: Here is a list of hardware requirements for running Unity 3D on your Ubuntu.\nA self test for checking Unity 3D compatibility is provided by Ubuntu itself:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nIf your hardware is not supported, you can fall back on the 2D desktop.

I've got a clean Lubuntu 11.10 install. In the days that I've used Microsoft Windows, I've used an external microphone for calling with Skype. The microphone was plug-and-play, and no drivers were needed.\nRight now, I'm using Skype on Lubuntu. I've installed PulseAudio, because it comes by default in Ubuntu, and it seemed wise to do so therefore. Whenever I make a test call, I won't get any input: it seems like the microphone doesn't record anything.\nSo, my question is: how can I get an external (line-in) microphone to work in Lubuntu?\n\nA: I got it working by doing this. You should enter the commands in a terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install pulseaudio if you haven't done that already: \nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio\n\nor using Software center \n\n*Install pavucontrol and pavumeter if you haven't done that already: \nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol pavumeter\n\n\n*Restart to get pulseaudio running\n\n*Start pavucontrol, and make sure that input/output is set to Audio Stereo Duplex\n\n*Start alsamixer, and set the values as follows:\n\n\nOutput\n- Master: 100\n- Set the others values on 63, including CAPTURE\n\nInput\n- Line-in: 40\n- Mic: 63\n- Phone: 40\n- Aux: 40\n- Analog Source: mic\n- Digital Source: i2s in\n- Shared Mic: mic in\n\nIf you get a strange 'looping beep' right now, don't worry, this happened to me too.\nStart Skype.\nBecause of the restart you did earlier, Skype should automatically use PulseAudio.

Something like a \"quick OS switcher\".\nIs this possible?\n\nA: This can be done with grub-reboot.\ngrub-reboot sets the default boot entry for GRUB, for the next boot only.\ngrub-reboot ENTRY\n\nENTRY is a number or a menu item title.\nSee man grub-reboot for more info.\n", "Q: Why are my file selection dialogs so big? How do I make them smaller? When I use an external monitor, my file selection dialog boxes seem to be huge -- wider than my larger screen. I assume it is a nautilus issue since it happens whether I'm trying to open a file to upload (in firefox) or attach (in thunderbird) or just open it in LibreOffice. See screenshot:\n\nThe browser window fills my left-hand monitor, the \"open\" dialog is wider than one screen, and wider than the window that spawned it. It's huge. It didn't used to be huge. \nIs there some way to force dialog windows to be smaller by default? Whenever I try to open/attach/upload a file I have to re-size the finder dialog before I can see what I'm looking at. I don't understand why it is defaulting to such a huge window.\n\nA: The window size in stored in a dconf key. You should install dconf-editor (it's in the software centre). Then, navigate to org.gtk.settings.file-chooser and adjust the window-size key.\nDoes this solve your problem?\n\nA: I solved this by modifying a plugin in compiz-config manager: Windows Manager:Windows Rules:Size Rules:\nNew-> Size Windows: \"type=Dialog\", and set the size.\n\nA: If I just do ALT-{SPACE BAR} and choose Restore it makes the box smaller.  Then, next time it will open whatever size you made it.\n\nA: I managed to find a solution by figuring out that the dialog modal is always 1440 px wide. So I did grep -r \"1440\" ~/.config (I also looked in ~/.gnome, ~/.gconf, ~/.gconfd/ but they didn't turn up anything interesting.) I stumbled upon this gem:\n.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini:GeometryWidth=1440\n\nRemoving that line (and the corresponding GeometryHeight) solved the problem for me.\n\nA: This worked for me: To prevent the settings from resetting you need to add StartupMode=cwd to the ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini file. Something like below.\nGeometryX=100\nGeometryY=100\nGeometryWidth=600\nGeometryHeight=400\nStartupMode=cwd\n\n\nA: I'm not sure, but it looks like the Archlinux guys had a similar issue where the gconf-key /apps/nautilus/preferences/navigation_window_saved_geometry was missing.\nDoes this solve the problem?\n\nA: Open the file below (no need to terminal; it’s under your own home):\n ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini\n\nI solved my problem on my netbook by this numbers:\nGeometryX=100\nGeometryY=100\nGeometryWidth=600\nGeometryHeight=400\nI’m not sure what these values really mean; but they are good and position the file chooser at middle center of your screen.\n", "Q: Alternatives to LibreOffice What alternatives to LibreOffice (specially LO Writer) does Ubuntu come with.

There is no substitute for a good Latex editor though, texmaker  is a fine one.\nScribus may also be considered, while it is a page layout program and not a word processor there is a story editor that have similar behaviour to a word processor and there are many instance where something like this is better for document creation than a word processor. \nFor drawing Xfig and Inkscape are quite good.\nFor database, sqliteman interface to the sqlite database system\n\nA: At the suggestion of @k0pernikus, I've put my comment into an answer:\nNow worth an \"answer\" but if you have a google account, you can use Google Docs.

I'd like to have different backup jobs scheduled at different times and frequencies (for instance, backup my Documents folder daily, but my music folder only on weekends), or backup daily to my local disk, and weekly to my remote server.  I can see only how to set up a single backup job for a specified set of folders to a specified destination in DejaDup.  \nIf there's no way to do this in DejaDup backup utility at the moment, what is my best alternative solution?\n\nA: Deja Dup cannot do that at the moment, you are right.

Ive seen plenty of guides on how to prevent the launcher/sidebar from ever auto-hiding, but how would I prevent it from ever showing except when I press the left cmd/win key?\n\nA: For Unity\nYou can try CCSM  to autohide the launcher.\nTo do that, install CCSM by clicking the link. After installing it, open CCSM and go to 'Ubuntu Unity Plugin' under Desktop. \n\nChoose 'Autohide' option in the dropdown list next to 'Hide Launcher'. Now, the launcher will show if you move your cursor to the left side or you press the Meta key. \n\nSo, in order to prevent the launcher from appearing when you move your cursor to the left side, go to 'Reveal mode' in the same option page and unselect all the selected corners.

I sometimes find small bugs in dialogs or windows. For instance, I found a very minor bug in the sound preference dialog.

I would imagine something like xwininfo; you'd run the command, the mouse pointer would change and when you click a window, the command returns the package name. With such a command, it would be easy to expand it to gather version information, distro and open the bug tracker on the right page. \nWe used to have Help > Report a problem, but since Gnome Control Center doesn't use menus, that option is not available. This, of course, would be true for all windows that doesn't use menus.

It's even messier than I imagined since you apparently can't pipe to dpkg or which.\ndpkg -S $(which $(xprop | grep \"WM_CLASS(STRING)\" | grep -o \"\\\".*\\\"\" | cut -d \",\" -f 1 | tr -d '\"\"')) | cut -d \":\" -f 1\nLet's unpack this a little. The grep and cut stuff are simply searching for and manipulating strings. The interesting things are:\n\n\n*\n\n*xprop - Lets you find out information about the window you click on.\n\n*which - Returns the full path of the command used. Example:\n$ which  gnome-control-center\n/usr/bin/gnome-control-center\n\n\n*dpkg -S - Given a file, provides the name of the source package it comes from. Very useful when the binary name and source package name differ. Example:\n$ dpkg -S /usr/bin/orca\ngnome-orca: /usr/bin/orca\n\n\nA: Open a terminal (ctrl-alt-t) and type\nubuntu-bug -w\n\na message will pop up instructing you to click on a window to file a bug report about the application owning that window.\nIncidentally, this uses apport, which collects a lot of useful debugging information automatically and is the preferred way to report Ubuntu bugs.\n", "Q: No ruby alternatives on 11.04 / 11.10?

I'd like to start my sshd upon first connection to port 22.\nI now have:\nstart on socket PROTO=inet PORT=22 in my ssh.conf and I have upstart-socket-bridge and upstart-udev-bridge jobs running.\nThe ssh job starts OK when I connect to my box on port 22 but sshd doesn't talk back to me. Its as if it doesn't receive it and cannot accept it. Retrying to connect will not help, even sshd is now running and should be accepting the connections normally. Upstart is still messing with it!\nSocket event man pages say:\n\nWhen  an  incoming  connection  is  detected,   the   file   descriptor\n         representing the socket is passed to the job in question to allow it to\n         accept(2)  the  connection.

IF that is the case, it kinda spoils all the fun :/\n\nA: I'd strongly recommend running sshd as a normal service instead of launching it on demand. sshd is quite capable of managing connections on its own in all but the most extreme cases.\nIf you absolutely must launch sshd on-demand, the following commands are helpful for troubleshooting:\n\n\n*\n\n*ps auxw | grep ssh, grep for ssh in the list of running processes.\n\n*netstat -tlp, gives a list of the TCP ports that a service is\ncurrently listening on. SSH should be listed here, if not, sshd isn't\nconfigured properly.\n\n*ssh -vvv (run from the client), detailed debug output from your ssh\nsession, helps pinpoint the failure point.\n\n*nmap <hostname> (run from a client--requires installation of the\nnmap package), list open ports on the host. If SSH isn't listed here\nbut is listed in the netstat output, you've probably got a firewall\nissue.\n\n\nA: Using the socket bridge requires a patched daemon that can handle the socket that it is given.\nFrom man socket-event:\n\nWhen an incoming connection is detected, the file descriptor representing the socket is passed to  the  job  in  question  to  allow  it  to accept(2)  the connection.

You can solve some of them by paying close attention to your system, whereas others are very hard to fix. Fortunately, most of these issues are gone Precise Pangolin (to become 12.04 in April) so we have good times ahead. If it's a big problem for you, then I would recommend that you install 10.04 if that's possible, since that will be upgradeable to 12.04 when it's released. Or, if you're a bit more adventurous, you can upgrade/install 12.04 now. It is under development, so you'll have to watch out a little bit when you install upgrades, but there have been rather few issues with it. On both my desktop and laptop, 12.04 is much better than 11.10. Battery time on my laptop has gone from 3.5-4 hours to more than 5 hours. \nIf it's not too big a problem, and you don't feel too adventurous, then I would recommend just waiting a little while and upgrade to 12.04. \n", "Q: Problem while updating When I try to do the system update I get this:\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/language-pack-en/language-pack-en_11.10+20111121_all.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/language-pack-gnome-en/language-pack-gnome-en_11.10+20111121_all.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nautilus/libnautilus-extension1_3.2.1-0ubuntu3.1_i386.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nautilus/nautilus-data_3.2.1-0ubuntu3.1_all.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nautilus/nautilus_3.2.1-0ubuntu3.1_i386.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/b/banshee/banshee_2.2.1-1ubuntu2_i386.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/b/banshee/banshee-extension-soundmenu_2.2.1-1ubuntu2_i386.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/u/ubuntuone-client/libsyncdaemon-1.0-1_2.0.0-0ubuntu2.2_i386.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/u/ubuntuone-client/ubuntuone-client_2.0.0-0ubuntu2.2_all.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/u/ubuntuone-client/python-ubuntuone-client_2.0.0-0ubuntu2.2_all.deb 404  Not Found\nFailed to fetch http://rs.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/b/banshee/banshee-extension-ubuntuonemusicstore_2.2.1-1ubuntu2_i386.deb 404  Not Found\n\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: I've faced a similar problem.

This related topic recommends that I use MythTV, and from that I have a new question:\nGiven that I have a working Windows machine that I want to keep as a fall-back, would installing Wubi with the Mythbuntu choice be the simplest way to get a fully working Ubuntu-based media center?\nNote that this computer is not just for watching DVD's -- I want to watch live TV and schedule recordings from live TV. I receive ~40 analog channels and 4 digital (DVB-T) channels through the same antenna cable on a single tv card. This works fine in Windows and I hope that Ubuntu / MythTV can handle that too.\n\nA: You can try it with Wubi, or, alternatively, to resize the Windows partition, create a Linux partition in the free space and install Mythbuntu there. The latter approach is probably more future-proof in case you decide to get rid of Windows... also, you're going to need a lot of disk space for recordings, so a separate hard drive will be the ultimate solution.\n", "Q: Which application is responsible for accepting passwords when entered in diffrent keyboard layout?

And I don't have any internet connection in Ubuntu so how can I update my software without internet connection and install other software? Please help me?\n\nA: This all depends on what type of file you're trying to install. If it's a .deb just run\nsudo dpkg -i <deb-file>\nIf it's is a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 it's most likely a source package. That means you will have to compile the application on your computer. This is usually described in a file in the archive called INSTALL or README. The most common way for these are\ntar zxf <file.tar.gz> 'or' tar jxf <file.tar.bz2>\ncd <dir_from_package>\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nOf course installing source packages require that you have a compiler and the development libs required for the program you wish to install. Since you are on a ubuntu system I suggest you stick to installing .deb supported by the ubuntu version you're using.\n\nA: Well the interesting and difficult part of the question is you don't have an Internet-connection. Which means you will have great deal of difficulty in downloading and installing a lot of drivers and updates. More than anything (as per my experience with Ubuntu or Linux) you have to have a net connection. And if you have a net-connection then many times you can easily install many utilities via 'synaptic manager'.\nAs you have asked about how to install softwares. In Linux different utilities have different ways of installation processes. On the top of it, many times you face some problems and have to resolve some issues, while installing a particular s/w. In which case you have to check forums for the solutions.\nI suppose you are a novice to Linux (as I am). So try to put up the exact things that you do with your machine. If you are doing something in the terminal, then do post the command that you are giving or the error messages, in case you get any.\n\nA: In general, you can install software from a hard disk through a gui called \"APTonCD\". But for that to work you'd need a system with the app on it in the first place. Worth checking out if I understand your question. You may have to create a CD first then ISO it onto a hard disk.

I would like to be able to graphically log in to another Ubuntu machine (the server) from my Ubuntu desktop machine (the client), much like with Windows' Remote Desktop.\nThe \"Desktop Sharing\" settings that come installed by default seem to use VNC. VNC is a bit of a bandwidth hog, can only work at the resolution of whatever screen is attached to the host, requires you to log in at the machine itself, and mirrors every action on the host.\nI know about X tunnelling, but that's annoying to use and doesn't always work properly (or, more accurately, some apps don't work properly).\nIs there any kind of tool in between the two, similar to Remote Desktop used for Windows? Specifically, something with the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*can run at a different resolution to the host screen (if there is one)\n\n*can run at full screen\n\n*has adjustable quality settings for different bandwidths\n\n*doesn't require a user to be logged in locally\n\n*saves credentials or uses SSH keys\n\n*starts automatically on the server\n\n*client works under Gnome 3 and Unity\n\n*can be restricted to work with non-compositing DEs on the server (eg. XFCE)\n\n\nI've been using X2go for a while, but unfortunately it no longer works fullscreen on Gnome 3 due to a couple of bugs (#1072 and #982), so if there's a better solution out there I'd like to try it.\n\nA: Chrome Remote Desktop BETA\n★★★★½\n\nThis is a Chrome extension by google, which installs a plugin in chrome for enabling remote desktop sharing. The sharing is much simpler compared to other solutions, and is easy to setup.\n\n\nChrome Remote Desktop BETA allows users to remotely access another computer through Chrome browser or a Chromebook.  Computers can be made available on an short-term basis for scenarios such as ad hoc remote support, or on a more long-term basis for remote access to your applications and files.  All connections are fully secured.\n\n\nA: In general, xrdp will do what you want. And is compatible with many RDP clients out there.\nThe drawback is that Unity, the default WM in Ubuntu, no longer supports it. I believe, although I've never tried it, that it works with GNOME.\nFor my personal use, I just installed MATE desktop (as it has less \"flair\" then GNOME) and configured Ubuntu to use that whenever remotely logging in.\nSee here for information on setting it up (This answer uses XFCE for remote-desktop. You may choose something else):\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/592544/595510\n\nA: There is a linux RDP-server http://www.xrdp.org/\nI used it some time ago. It worked flawlessly.\n\nA: I use NoMachine's free client (and server). They have repos which makes it easy to install. It works like a charm. \n\nA: x11vnc \nBy installing and running x11vnc on the remote we will have access to far more options than with vnc (see manpage for x11vnc). Still you have the advantage of staying within the vnc architecture.\n\nA: I would recommend X2go. It's very similar to RDP and highly efficient even over low-bandwidth, high-latency connections. Clients for all systems, including a plugin for Firefox, etc. It works over ssh and integrates with PulseAudio so you can use VoIP, for instance. Read more on http://www.x2go.org\nThe x2go client requires a session command to execute upon logging in. For example, to use Unity 2D, use the session command: gnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d. This was found by looking in the file (on the host) /usr/share/xsessions/ubuntu-2d.desktop and copying value of the Exec=... line. If you want to use some other session, you can use the value from another file in /usr/share/xsessions/, but it seems that anything requiring 3D acceleration will not work.\n\nA: Spice http://www.spicespace.org/ might be interesting, though it's focused on virtualization.\nFrom their site:\n\nThe Spice project aims to provide a complete open source solution for\n  interaction with virtualized desktop devices.The Spice project deals\n  with both the virtualized devices and the front-end.

Example: fixing the beep\nMy needs are slightly different in that I do not want to ensure sound card beeps are functioning.  Instead, I want PC speaker beeps, the kind produced by the original built-in speaker because I believe they will produce less CPU load.  I have confirmed that my computer has the PC speaker by unplugging the external speakers and shutting down Ubuntu.  At some point in the shutdown and restart process a beep is heard even though the external speakers have no power.  \nI have tried the following:\nIn /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, turn these lines into comments:\n#blacklist snd_pcsp\n#blacklist pcspkr\n\nIn .bashrc\n/usr/bin/xset b on\n/usr/bin/xset b 100\n\nEnable in the gnome terminal: Edit > Profile Prefs > General > Terminal Bell \nEnsure no \"mute\" selections in: System > Prefs > Sound > various tabs (uncheck them all).\nSelect \"Enable window and button sounds\" in: System > Prefs > Sound > Sound Effects\nIn gconf-editor desktop > gnome > sound, select the three sound check boxes.\nIn gconf-editor apps > metacity > general select the audible bell check box.\nStill I get no PC speaker beeps when I send code 7 to the console via my Java program or use \necho -e '\\a'\n\nor equivalently\necho -e \"\\a\"\n\non the bash command line. (The -e option means enable escape sequence interpretation.) What else should I try?\nUpdate Since my goal is to minimize load on the CPU, here is a comparison of elapsed times.  Each test is for 100,000 iterations.  Each variant was performed three times so three results are presented for each.\nprintwriter.format(\"%c\", 7); \n// 1.3 seconds, 1.5 seconds, 1.5 seconds\n\nToolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep(); \n// 0.8 seconds, 0.3 seconds, 0.5 seconds\n\ntry { Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"beep\"); } catch (IOException e) { } \n// 10.3 seconds, 16.3 seconds, 11.4 seconds\n\nThese runs were done inside Eclipse so multiply by some value less than 1 for standalone execution.  Unfortunately, Toolkit's beep is silent on my computer and so is code 7.  The beep utility works but has the most cost.\n\nA: On my Oneiric system I had to do the following to get XBell/XkbBell working again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the module pcspkr (like you already did via /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf)\n\n*Remove the package pulseaudio-module-x11 (that seems to absorb all XBell events)\n\n*Put options snd-hda-intel beep_mode=2 into /etc/modprobe.d/enable-beep.conf (you only need that case you own a system with an intel sound chip like my Latitude E6420). Unmute the speaker in alsamixer after that.\n\n\nSome terminals (like konsole, see bug Bug 177861) ignore the bell character. A good way to test the system beep is with the xkbbell command.\nAfter I did all that the java call Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep() works just fine.\n\nA: On 14.04.3 LTS it nows seems sufficient to edit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and enable pcspkr by commenting out the blacklist line.\n#blacklist pcspkr\n\nThe # turns the line into a comment.\nMake sure the Terminal (gnome-terminal) allows console bell in the preferences tab.\nThis was tested via backspace on an empty terminal line. This was also tested via the beep utility (assuming that you have installed it). Instead you can do programmatic beeping via the java.awt.Toolkit object: java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep().\nThe Toolkit object is more efficient than the beep utility.\nBy the way, some people dislike the PC speaker.\n\nA: Make sure your terminal and theme don't eat the event.\nExternal tools work, you say. You could dive into their code. This might help.\n\nA: Use the beep program. I've compiled the v1.3, because the 1.2.2  in Lucid repositories do not work.\n\n*\n\n*you need to run it with sudo\n\n*the pcspkr module must be loaded, as you all ready did\n\n", "Q: PHP shell_exec() in ubuntu I am using ubuntu with libreOffice.

I'd try listing the fat32 filesystem before the swapfile in /etc/fstab. By the way, to specify a swapfile instead of a partition something like this works in fstab:\n/media/fat32-partition/swapfile.swp     none    swap    sw   0  0\n\nIf not, you can always add swapon -a to /etc/rc.local to re-enable the swapfiles once all the boot scripts are run, at which point all the filesystems should be mounted and visible.\nFinally, do keep in mind that going through the filesystem layer will slow down access to your swap file. If at all possible, I'd strongly recommend trying to add a dedicated swap partition.\n", "Q: Why does it take a long time to copy files to thumb drives? I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 64bit. Since a few days, when I try to copy not so large (about 700MB) files to my thumb drive it copies all the data except for last few MBs very fast and keep holding when it has about 3MBs to go. Sometimes in a few minutes the coping get finished but sometimes it won't go any further. \nPlease help!!!\n\nA: The difference in speed is normally caused by buffering from your OS, i.e. your OS reads all the files, as fast as it can, from disk into memory. From memory it will then proceed to write them to the thumb drive. As your harddisk is normally faster then your thumbdrive your OS will buffer the files it has not yet written internally. For your file browser it will look like the files have already been copied, but in reality they haven't yet left your computer, they are still in the buffer waiting. When the internal buffer is full or you unmount the drive, the OS will write all the buffered data to the drive, thus the last files written or the unmount process can take quite a while longer then the initial files.\nOne can change that behavior by specifying the sync flag when mounting the drive, this will stop the OS from not using any internal caching for the drive, but that will lead to more equally distributed copying speed, but it will also lead to overall slower speed, thus I wouldn't recommend it.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 10.04 on ICH6R RAID 1 I have a machine running Win7 in RAID 1 Mirror Array.

They told me \"Though you do now have 6 GB, when you use your current Ubuntu, you'll only have 3 GB available. You have to install the latest version of 64-bit Ubuntu to enable all of the 6 GB.\"\nHe was in a hurry to leave without explaining more. I turned on my laptop, used gnome-system-monitor to check, and as he said, it shows I only have 3 GB of RAM.\nCould someone explain me why? Why do I have just 3 GB available, and why installing a 64-bit version makes all of the 6 GB available?\n\nA: If you have the 32bit version installed then you either need to install the 64bit version or you can just install a PAE kernel that can access all your ram.  From terminal or ALT+F2 run sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-pae linux-headers-generic-pae and reboot\nYou need a pae/64bit kernel to use more than 3.2gb as 32bit can not address more than that. It's a hardware limitation, not a linux one.\n\nA: You will be able to use all 6G of RAM if you will choose the *-pae kernel when you boot in the Grub menu.\nPAE stands for Physical Address Extension and if you can't see it in the menu you can use Synaptic to add it to your current kernel. Be sure to install the same version though.\n\nA: RAM in common computers is addressed (i.e. referred to by programs) using sequences of bits that correspond to powers of two. When you're using a 32-bit operating system, it means that programs have (at most) 32 bits available to them to describe each address. This 32-bit limit, fundamentally, lies in hardware: the x86 family of processors originally reserved just 32 bits for addresses.\nThe total number of different unique sequences you can organise 32 bits in is 4,294,967,296. For computers, this means you can only refer to that many different addresses in the memory. To point to more addresses (so that each address still remains unique) you must have more bits.\nThat large total number translates to 4 GB. As for why, in practice, it can actually be a quarter less than that, the 3 GB barrier Wikipedia article will explain.\nPhysical Address Extension or PAE, on hardware level, is an extension the 32-bit addressing in x86 processors: PAE processors have 36 bits for memory, thus extending the range of addresses available for the operating system (which then divides this memory among the programs). When you're installing a PAE kernel, you're in effect installing low-level operating system support for this extended x86 hardware.\nWhen you have a 64-bit processor (as most modern processors are), you can run operating systems and applications that are built to address memory using those 64 bits. This gives them a total of \"18446744073709551616 different values, a number in excess of 18 quintillion\". In theory, at least, that means you won't run out of addresses before you have more than 16,8 terabytes of RAM.\n", "Q: MySQL doesn't start due to a missing binary I need to install mysql 5.6 on my ubuntu machine for development reasons (the newest version contains features that I need to incorporate into some web projects).

My setup at home is that my work laptop stays closed on a podium next to my desk and all my interaction with it is via an rdesktop session stretched across both screens of my top-right workspace. Rather than using the full-screen option, I instead set the geometry of the window to be the size of my dual-screen, minus the menu bar at the top, and use the -D option to hide the window decoration.

To change back (presuming your computer can support Unity, it will if it has had it before) then you will need to log out and at the bottom; choose the desktop environment that you prefer and log in with your usual credentials.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You may have accidentally logged in as Gnome Classic.

Can it be recovered? The laptop is a Dell Inspiron 2200 with only a 45gb hard-drive. It had Windows XP but I chose to replace it with Ubuntu. I installed it from CD created by download and then by use of Infra Recorder to produce the bootable disc.\nThe install gave messages suggesting that the cd drive was faulty or dirty or that the cd needed to be created at a slower speed. Despite this the install produced a ubuntu desk top screen with icons including one for Firefox. I selected Firefox and successfully navigated the internet to the BBC Website.\nI also looked around other components of the desktop.\nI concluded that I had a successful install and so shut down the system and the laptop.\nWhen I subsequently switched on the laptop again the first screen to appear was, as always, a message advising that Battery Recalibration was needed and that it would run for 3-5 hours. F1 to continue or ESC to cancel. As always, in response to this  I pressed ESC but this time with no result. I cannot now get past this screen.\nThis is an oldish laptop recently inherited from my daughter and so of minimum value but I had seen it as my chance to try Ubuntu without impacting my regular desktop PC. Can the laptop be rescued for another go at Ubuntu? Any help would be much appreciated.\nThankyou.     \n\nA: Here are the things I would try to narrow down the diagnosis of what is wrong and what I could do to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would check that the md5 hash of the data on the disk is correct\nvia the place you downloaded the disk image in the first place, to\nbe sure that the initial cd install wasn't corrupted, sometimes\nburning a full os image gives me weird results.\n\n*I would also simply try running from a ubuntu live cd and seeing if\nyou can get an os running without the hard-drive being involved.  If\nyou can't even boot via a livecd, that points to issues beyond the\ncurrent install.\n\n*Finally, are you able to start the process of reinstalling the\nubuntu os again?  Not fun, I know, but it's possible just\nreinstalling over your current install (with a newly burned & checked ubuntu image) might make the difference.\n\nA: This problem seems not to be related with ubuntu at all.\nIt seems that some Dell laptops show the Battery Recalibration message when they have problems with the battery, this could means that the battery is almost dead and the bios batteru controller cannot charge it.\nI will try starting the laptop without battery, just with AC, if this works then you should buy another battery. If you do not want to buy another battery check your bios ( advanced tab ) where you should find a way to supress the message.\nHope this helps \n", "Q: How can I install a program from a PPA that is listed as being for 12.04 when I'm using 11.10?

Of course you may run into dependency problems when you try to install as the precise version may depend on libraries from precise.\n\nA: After having used the kindly provided answer by psusi, I also discovered an alternative GUI-based method for doing this which I'll add as some people may find it easier.\nOpen the Ubuntu Software centre and select Edit > Software Sources\nClick on the PPA contains the program you wish to install and select Edit\n\nThen replace the text 'Oneiric' in the distribution field of the next menu with 'Precise'\n\n\nA: Instead of altering your sources list which may result in unwanted dependency problems I suggest using the program prevu, which is designed to backport software packages.\n", "Q: Install 'grub-pc', changed repository I am trying to use a program to fix my booting.

Do not install the drivers from any different place than Ubuntu, or you will perhaps be seeing yourself dealing with more problems. Simply do the following for extreme quality:\nFrom the AMD Catalyst Control Center:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the \"free of fragmentation desktop\" technology, from the \"screen options\" section. Desktop and video will clearly go faster.\n\n*Set the \"wait for vertical sync\" option, from the \"3D\" section, to \"Activated, except when told by the application\". Then 3D animations will be perceived smoother.\n\n*Disable the \"Catalyst A.I.\" technology, since applications can be tuned more accurately without it since no 3D configuration in games is auto-managed by the driver.\n\n*If your screen supports HDMI conection and audio output, use HDMI over any other connection; since you will be able to use the integrated HDMI sound processor on the graphic card, which is of superb quality, and the YCbCr 4:4:4 pixel format, which is more accurate than any other. No problem for now if you see black borders because of doing so.\n\n*In other case, try using DVI connection if supported; since it's the remaining output that is digital.\n\n*Set your screen to its standard values and disable any auto-improving technology; since in this way the image will be the closest to what the multimedia creators saw in their screens when creating the contents, and they're the best people to set this values.\n\n*If your computer is connected to the monitor using a DVI or an HDMI cable, Set the graphics processor to scale the screen in the \"screen manager\" section; since scalers of this time are usually better than the screen's ones.\n\n*If your computer is connected to the monitor using a DVI or an HDMI cable, set the \"graphic processor scaling\" method to \"keep aspect ratio\". This will make screen aspect ratio to be always corrected represented and images will not be \"fat\".\n\n*If you see black borders in the screen, set the \"scaling options\" bar to \"0%\". Repeat this if you see black borders appearing again in a different resolution that you intend to use in a game.\n\n\nIn CompizConfig, a tool you can download from the software center:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the vertical sync option in the \"OpenGL\" section. This will make Unity to run smoothly.\n\n*If you're using a desktop with a big screen, in the \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\" section set the \"Hide Launcher\" option to \"never\". You will note a great improvement in the usability of Unity.\n\n\nIf you notice problems with the Unity shell or with Adobe Flash, in the log-in screen choose to do so using \"Ubuntu 2D\" shell instead of \"Ubuntu\" one.\nI will wait for the day we could not spend the 75% of time solving problems caused by proprietary software.\n\nA: flash lags--sure: unless you used http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/01/youtube-lens-adds-minitube-playback-option/ or https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashvideoreplacer/ or any apps to stream youtube videos such as Minitube, VLC...\nvideo lags--sure: if you're using Totem to play high definition videos.

I searched the support website for Thunderbird and couldn't find anything.\n\nA: It is possible to send an HTML E-mail that loads an image from a remote Web server. The reference to the image could be something other than an image, even though an image is actually displayed in the E-mail. This could contain variables that I want to learn, such as who received my E-mail, and many other variables gathered when the E-mail client loads the \"image\" from the Web server. And there are many more techniques.\n\nA: Basically, images embedded (via HTML) into an email message aren't downloaded like attachments, they're loaded from a web server somewhere.\nSo, if I was a nefarious spammer and I had a list of 500,000 email addresses and wanted to know which of those addresses were definitely real and/or active, all I need to do is embed an image (could even be a 1 pixel transparent image you would never know was there without examining HTML) and then go back and check my server logs for who is accessing the image from where. So if you load the email with the image, BAM, I know your email address is a prime target and should be kept on my list and/or added to other lists.\nThis is gross simplification, but that is why most email clients and services block embedded images by default.\n", "Q: How do I install Apache and PHP on 11.10? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's the easiest way to set up a LAMP stack? \n\nI would like to install Apache and PHP on my new machine, running Ubuntu 11.10, but I can't see either of them listed in the software centre.

Many of the extras are \"plugins\" , ie \"xfce4-foo-plugin\"\nEither search for the packages, or if you prefer, install the \"goodies\" package\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/xfce4-goodies\nAdditional packages to consider (IMO) might be firefox, synaptic, squeeze, xfburn\nText editors , personally I prefer gedit as it has a number of features, but leafpad or mousepad are more traditional / lightweight (but scant features).\nThe following would give you a nice (IMO), minimal setup, adapt the packages as you wish.\nsudo apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies xfce4-mixer gedit squeeze synaptic xfburn lightdm audacious audacious-plugins\n\nOther plugins listed here\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=xfce&searchon=name&subword=1&version=all&release=all\nAdd in a few fonts and multimedia as required and you would be good to go.\n", "Q: Lap top will not Boot I have downloaded and installed Ubuntu erasing XP in the process.

You only need a supported browser which is firefox or chrome/chromium etc. \nOpera is mentioned but I would be surprised if anything other than the Opera developer version for linux was supported because linux opera is severely outdated but who knows, all I know is that it works fine and tested less than 10 minutes ago on firefox-34.0 with nothing to install.\nTo start a video call:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a chat window with a friend \n\n*Click  in the top right corner\nIf your friend isn't currently able to receive a video call the will be grayed out, and you'll see a message that says \"[Name] is currently unavailable for video calling.\"\n\nA: Facebook does not currently support Linux.

I use a gtk TreeView to display different websites in my Python program. When the selected rows change, the web page is updated to the url field in the store. This works nicely, but a lot of web pages uses javascript to focus an input field. This means I can't use the keyboard to navigate the TreeView. \nI don't know how to disable javascript completely, but I also don't want to, because an increasing number of pages are dependent on it. However, I would like to prevent the focus theft. One thing I could do, is to implement some sort of memory about what the user has done, and if focus is removed without user interaction, then I move focus back to the last widget the user interacted with. But this seems ugly. Is there a better way? \n\nA: From the comments:\nThe 1.9.1 release of webkit (which isn't even in quantal as of this writing) claims to have fixed\" Web content (except plugins) should no longer steal focus from other GTK+ widgets.\" (mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2012-April/…) Also see bug: bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77791 – andrewsomething Jun 9 at 20:32\n", "Q: Dell Dimension 3000 using Cisco AM10 I have the same problem of the computer going to sleep and not waking up on a Dell Dimension 3000 on dual boot with XP and Ubuntu 11.1.

Since by default, GNOME organizes its \"Applications\" pane in alphabetical order, there is always a sprawling mess of applications, and I don't like how it automatically arranges them into categories (\"Accessories\", \"Electronics\", \"Games\", etc). Is there perhaps a shell extension so that I can manually organize my applications in folders or something? Windows-style?\n\nA: You can install alacarte, which shows up as an app called \"Main Menu\". You can create your own menus, drag apps (menu items) into them, then uncheck the normal menus / items, and only your custom menus will show up as the categories in the applications pane.\n\nA: Open up main-menu from applications and you can move them up and down as you wish.\n\nA: There is an application called Meow which, when installed, allows you to edit the Gnome menu items.

Or possibly overwrite ubuntu with another distro (i.e. mint) while still keeping my \"home\" intact. I'm also thinking of making another partition to install mint alongside ubuntu with BOTH sharing the same home directory.\nQ1: Can I do a fresh reinstall of the system without wiping out the home dir?\nQ2: How can I install mint (or other distro) alongside ubuntu in 2 separate systems dir. but only 1 home dir?\nThanks.\n[ am not a newbie, but NOT a programmer, just a power user ]\n\nA: Personally I would advise you share a data directory. Mount is at /media/data or what name you would like to give it. In the data partition you can save configuration files you use across distros. Personally I use .vim , .vimrc , .zshrc across distributions for example. I also share background images , icon sets, etc.\nYou can use links or mount --bind to link things in the data partition to home.\nln -s /media/share/.icons ~/.icons\n\nIf you share a /home, be sure to understand the implications. Your user home directory is /home/your_login_name.\nAs long as you have a unique log in name for each distribution I would not anticipate any problem sharing /home . If, however, you share /home/your_login_name across distributions you might have problems. Problems could arise from conflicting configurations in .gnome (or other directories) as there is a moderate amount of variation in how gnome is implemented on various distributions (Unity vs gnome-shell vs cinnamon).  \nSharing /home != sharing /home/your_login_name .\nEither way, sharing a /data partition or sharing a /home partition, be very careful not to format it when installing a new OS.\n\nA: You always get the possibility to choose whether you partition your system or use existing partitions, as well as the locations of your root, swap and home directories when you install a new Linux distribution. The home directory you have for Ubuntu will be visible for the setup, so you can set it as your home directory for any distribution you install.\n", "Q: Resize/Move edge too narrow on windows \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I increase the resize margin on windows? \n\nWhen hovering near the edge of a window you get an option to resize them.\nHowever that edge is too narrow when I'm using trackpoint or touchpad, making it difficult to hit the 'sweet spot'\nIs there a way I can increase the width (respectively height) of the 'hot-zone' ?\n\nA: You may like the keyboard shortcut as the easiest way to resize the window and totally avoid trying to grab the edge of the window!

I tried to set up two graphic cards but I failed. However I think my little research might be helpful for some other users.\nFIRST OF ALL: BE SURE THAT YOUR MAINBOARD SUPPORTS USING TWO (OR MORE) VGA CARDS.\nFor example on my mainboard there's no such possibility to use both: integrated and PCI card at the same time. Only one at a time. You can check it in bios.\nthe HowTo is very helpful, but many things are different in Lucid (10.04) at which I worked, so I will give a little update to it. As I said: I DIDN'T SUCCEED BECAUSE OF MY MAINBOARD LIMITATIONS so feel free to edit my answer and add Your remarks to it.\n1) First of all there might be no xorg.conf file in Lucid. We have to create one:\na) disable Your graphic enviroment, for Gnome it is:\nsudo stop gdm\n\nb) After it is stopped, it may look like it was suspended or sth, then press \nAlt+Ctrl+F1\n\nc) login in text mode using Your user\nd) create xorg.conf file:\nsudo Xorg -configure\n\ne) the contents of the file should be written on the screen and the path to the created file should be written also (path depends on how You are logged, as super user or as Your user and just using sudo command)\nf) copy created xorg.conf.new (it is created instead of xorg.conf, but it is the same)\nsudo cp xorg.conf.new xorg.conf.new.CARD0\n\n2) Turn off Your PC DISCONNECT IT FROM ELECTRICITY and remove Your first card (CARD0) from Your mainboard (physically).

I have a wrapper script A which is calling program B. A must be invoked as root so some initial setup can happen. After that, A calls setuid() and setgid() to reduce its own privileges, for safety and security. Then, A invokes B.\nThe problem is that B exhibits undesirable behavior if and only if A has called setuid()/setgid() before invoking B. This does not happen when I invoke B directly as different users via sudo -u xxx -g xxx. As far as I can tell (correct me if I am wrong), the only way B could know that A has changed the user is via the issetuid() syscall (I've checked the environment variables; they match). \nHow can I clear this bit, so that B behaves normally? It seems that the use of issetuid() is something about keeping track of whether the process is \"tainted\", i.e. carries artifacts from a less privileged environment (?). But I've reduced my privileges, not elevated them! And on top of that, I've scrubbed my env vars anyway! \nBeyond the very terse man page on issetuid(), I can find almost nothing about this syscall/magical program state. Can anyone lend a better understanding?\n\nA: Without more information ( such as the name of A and B software ), this is hard to diagnose.\nHowever, I would look at the environment variable, there is surely one that was not cleaned by A and that is cleaned by sudo.\n", "Q: Single-click to open folder on desktop not working on Xubuntu I've enabled single-click for opening files, folder etc. It is working normally inside a folder but i still need to double-click on files/folder on desktop.

I have a Samsung Rugby II phone, which I charge by plugging into the USB port.  It has pictures and video on it, which I'd like to get out through the USB port, but nothing pops up in Ubuntu when I plug it in.\nWhen I plug it in, the phone presents a menu asking me to select the USB mode.  The choices are \"Media Player\", \"PC Studio\", and \"Mass Storage\".\nIf I select \"Media Player\", the response to lsusb in Ubuntu is:\nBus 001 Device 008: ID 04e8:5a0f Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd Meizu M6 MiniPlayer\nIf I select \"PC Studio\", lsusb says:\nBus 001 Device 011: ID 04e8:6810 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd \nIf I select \"Mass Storage\", nothing is ever presented according to lsusb, and the phone is stuck in a prompt asking me to \"Insert Memory Card\".

The phone needs a memory card before it can be interfaced your computer. The card has to be bought separately and is placed behind the battery in the phone back. There is no indication of this either on the phone or, in my case, in the owner's manual; I had to go to the place whee I bought the phone to learn about this.

So I also fall under their password policy, which dictates that I change it every so often. I keep up to date with all updates from Ubuntu. \nThe first time that I mounted network shares (with a bookmarked smb:// URL), I checked the 'Remember forever' option and it worked just fine. Reboot, mount a network share, no problem, all automatic. Then came the first mandated password change and it took all the fun of working with network shares away, because now I have to fill in the domain and the password after each reboot, no matter how often I check the 'Remember forever' box.\nI also compiled 'openchange' in the mean time (out of dissatisfaction with Evolution), which includes a 'samba4' sourcetree. Could that have anything to do with it ?\n\nA: Start the Seahorse password management application and delete the corresponding smb://...\nentry.\nAfter that, try to access the share again, and it should ask for the credentials again.

I am using Chrome and Chromium 16.0.912.75 (from the stable channels). I find the profile feature really useful. However, when new tabs are opened, or when I launch Chrome for the first time, the window/tab opens in the last profile I was using, not the default one.\nInstead I'd like new tabs opened from external applications, and the first window opened by the launcher, to use the same profile every time. If there is already a Chrome(ium) window open for that profile, the new tab should appear there. If that profile does not already have a window, a new window should be opened for it.\nMy current workaround has been to make all my profiles in Chrome, and a single profile in Chromium. One profile in Chrome is synched with the Chromium one via my Google account. Chromium is my default browser. This way, all new tabs are opened in Chromium, in my preferred profile. If I want to access the other profiles, I use Chrome. I'd much prefer to keep it simple!\nI know I could make my own Chrome .desktop file to force opening in the new profile every time, but the \"memory\" issue would remain for new tabs. According to this SuperUser question it is kinda possible in Windows with some registry editing.

The problem is that the new files do not overwrite the older files, so the file system fills up and all new files are discarded.\nSo I installed Scheduled Tasks in the Ubuntu GUI and created a task to run every day. Here is the task:\nfind /media/dvr/* -type f -mtime 0 -exec rm -rf {} \\; \n\nI have the -mtime set to 0 for testing purposes, it will be set to 7 if I can get this to work.\nThe problem I have is there is a lost+found folder in the /dvr folder. When it gets to that folder it says I do not have permission to view it and it never finishes its search. I have used sudo to get in and change the ownership and rwx permissions, but that still doesn't help.\nIs there a way to accomplish what I want to do by using find? Is there a more efficent way of cleaning out the /dvr/ folder?\nLike I said, new to this and trying to get better. Any help would be greatly appreciated!    \n\nA: Just do:\nfind /media/drv -name lost+found -prune -o -type f -exec echo '{}' ';'\n\nIn general it is a very very bad idea to redirect stderr to /dev/null. The whole point of stderr is to show unexpected errors. If you are expecting a certain error then construct your command to avoid it.\n\nA: The find command does not exit on permission problems as far as I know, it may just not be finding any files for a different reason. What I can suggest is to eliminate stderr so that you don't get misleading messages in the output, and to test the command using echo replacing rm -rf, i.e.,\nfind /media/drv/ -type f -mtime 7 -exec echo {} \\; 2> /dev/null\n\nThis should list the files that would be removed in your final version with rm -rf. If you really want to skip the lost+found directory (which should not be necessary), use:\nfind /media/drv/ -type f -mtime 7 -not -wholename \"*lost+found*\" -exec echo {} \\; 2> /dev/null\n\n\nA: Setting the permissions correctly should do it.  What does ls -ld /media/dvr/lost+found say?  Also drop the * at the end of /media/dvr/.  You want find to start its search in /media/dvr/, and when you add the *, the shell replaces that string with the name of every file it finds in /media/dvr/.\nYou also can just delete the lost+found directory.\n", "Q: Changes made in LibreOffice impression master slides are not seen in presentation I need presentation frequently for my teaching, when I want to make changes presentation wide using master view it is not shown in presentation and I need to do it manually for each slides\n\nA: Some things seem to work when changing an attribute on the master slide.

Samba is the easiest if a Windows computer is involved, but you can use it also between two Ubuntu (and even Mac OS) machines. SSH is a nice thing for Ubuntu, because it's a very powerful tool - e.g. running rsync over SSH is a command method to keep two directories synchronised. But I'd choose SMB because you mention Windows and probably setting up one protocol/server is enough for the beginning.\nOnly three important hints for further research about other protocols:\n\n\n*\n\n*Think about encryption - is it necessary that the protocol is encrypted or do you want to trust your LAN? (FTP is not encrypted, SSH/sFTP/SCP is)\n\n*Do need to transfer huge files? (SCP is really slow compared to SMB in Gigabit networks! Google benchmarks if you are interested.)\n\n*Is it necessary to keep the file permissions of the files transferred?\n\n\nNow your questions:\n1. When I share files between two Ubuntu machines via LAN, do I need Samba on both machines?\nNo, not the Samba server. There will be always a server and a client. You can access the shared folders on the server from the client - not the other way around. In other words: the copying progress bar will be always on the client, never on the server. But with two Ubuntu machines, both of them can be client and server at the same time, if you want. The client is shipped with Ubuntu per default, the server is installed automatically when you share a folder for the first time with Nautilus.\n2. Without Defining permission on computer 1 I can see all files under / on computer 2. Is their any way to stop that visibility?\nThat's not true for SMB/Samba. There are certain shared folders and only these are visible to the clients. Check the folder /var/lib/samba/usershares/ and the file /etc/samba/smb.conf, if the path / is shared. Probably you are connecting with SSH and not with SMB. Then you are right, usually everything is visible and you have to set the file and directory permissions correctly. You can find more details about this here: Simple & easy way to jail users\n3. Which user and password do I have to use while accessing other Ubuntu machine through Samba?\nUsually it's simple: just use any user and password of the other machine. Only in very special cases the user's normal password differs from his Samba password. You can change the Samba password separately with the command smbpasswd, but you should really have good reasons to use two different passwords. \nYou can allow shares without password. There are many things to say about this, but probably this Nautilus screenshot helps for the beginning:\n\n4. How to share files without GUI using the terminal?\nThe most common use case is SSH/SCP then probably. Just type the following in the client's terminal to copy /path/to/file1 on the client to /path/to/file2 on the server:\nscp /path/to/file1 server:/path/to/file2\n\nserver can be an IP address or a domain name. Or another method already mentioned in other answers with rsync:\nrsync /path/to/file1 server:/path/to/file2\n\nWith Samba you probably would use smbmount (which is not shipped with Samba per default) in order to mount a network share on the client. Then you can use it normally. There are many ways to mount a Samba share. If you are using Gnome, gvfs-mount might be the easiest method:\ngvfs-mount smb://server/nameOfsharedFolder\ncd ~/.gvfs/*\n\n5. Why is the server not showing up in Nautilus / Network on the client?\nAs far as I know, the first time it doesn't show up there. After connecting to it once, you'll find it there. The first time, you will have to click \"Windows Network\", then \"Workgroup\" and then you'll see your server - hopefully. At least this was the result of my tests.\n6. How to find the other system without knowing name or IP of the other system in LAN?\nYou can use nmap in the terminal, for example:\nnmap 192.168.0.*\n\nif 192.168.0.0 is your LAN. This will print you all network clients in your LAN (which can be discovered). Sometimes this might help, if other machines don't show up under Network.\n\nA: Question4: to copy files between two ubuntu-pc you can use scp or rsync. Or you can mount directories from p1 on p2 with sshfs. this can be done using terminal\nQuestion2: How do you access other Ubuntu Machines? \nIf you don't want other people to read your files you can use this:\nchmod -R o-rwX,g-rwX my-directory\n\nBut of course the root use can read them. \n\nA: The simplest sharing app is Giver - minimum configuration is required\n", "Q: Faenza microphone icon missing in the sound indicator I just installed the faenza icon theme and the microphone icon under the sound indicator is missing and replaced by a placeholder.

I maintain a few dozen servers all running Lucid. Setting up a local mirror is probably a good idea anyway, but I also have a unique need.\nThe (ec2 instance) servers are all configured to get security updates only. That's how I want it. The problem is that when I create a new server/ec2 instance and download packages, those packages are completely current and out-of-sync with the rest of the cluster. I can use Chef to pin explicit package versions, but then minor updates will make whatever we pin unavailable.\nSo what I'd like to do is this...

Then by pointing all my servers to that mirror, I can keep everything running the same version, but also avoid unnecessary updates.\nSetting up a mirror itself with apt-mirror seems simple enough, but what I'm missing is how to make sure the mirror only does security.

I was going to shrink it with gparted and use the free space for my home partition (root and home partitions are sda6 and sda7 respectively). But upon choosing the new size for the home partition, gparted mentions that when resizing the partition containing '/boot', linux might be unable to boot. As I don't know much about it, I ask here whether I can continue resizing the partitions without having to risk to re-install ubuntu again. Also, if this ain't possible, how should I resize my partitions as I need more space for '/home'.\nthanx in advance\n\nA: Resizing usually works, and although rare, problems can occur. Back up your data first and you probably need to resize in steps (resize / -> apply changes -> resize /home -> apply changes).\n\nA: Ignore the warning, it is obsolete.  With a correctly installed grub ( Ubuntu does it correctly ), resizing isn't a problem.\nNote that assuming your /home partition comes after your / partition, all of the data there will first have to be moved to the left and then the partition extended.  Depending on the size of /home, this can take quite some time, and if it is interrupted ( power fail? ), the whole fs will be trashed.\n\nA: You can always resize from a liveCD/USB, just remember, only do one task at a time. And don't use any other programs than gparted.\nIf you don't change the beginning of the root partition (just cut space from the end) there won't be any boot problems.\nIf you messed up your boot, you can correct it from a live cd/usb with this application: Boot-Repair\n\nA: i also had the same doubt...use gparted from live CD/USB Stick....it should not cause problems when 1 task is done at a time\n", "Q: Suppose I want to create my own interface in Ubuntu? Basically, I want to try making my own menu/launcher system. For the menu I'd like it to flow like the old drop-down menus (places, applications, administration, preferences etc...) except with a hub and spoke concept. Hover over the \"Main Menu\" icon and spokes appear with the spoke to the immediate right being highlighted. Turn the hub (sort of like an analogue dial) to rotate the spokes and highlight the different options (places, applications etc..). Selecting an option like applications then changes the text in the hub and the hub icon to \"applications\" and all the spokes change to the different categories under that heading. Eventually, I'd like for every launcher you put into your panel to be it's own hub offering features. For example: A Firefox hub would have spokes for opening another instance, bookmarks, safe-mode, etc. So, the firefox hub would allow you to open directly to a bookmark. Stuff like that.\nI've seen implementations close to this, but instead of the main icon taking on the characteristics of the selected menu item, it flowers out in concentric circles and gets large and cluttered.  I'd like a single icon/launcher to take on the properties of the selected item and the spokes to offer various options for the selected item/app.  This may not be very good. Especially if I have to make it. But I'd like to try if anyone has any advice.\n\nA: This is probably an unrealistic goal. Don't feel bad, I wouldn't even know where to begin myself. My advice would be to seek out a website that does something visually similar to what you want. Grab the HTML & CSS from the site and start reading up on Gnome 3 documentation. Since Gnome 3 uses web technologies like CSS you might have better luck developing this menu/launcher for the Gnome 3 desktop, not Unity.  \nI can picture what you are describing but I think it is too localised to what you want. Redoing an OS's user interface, or even just a launcher, will require at least a few experienced programmers to start and maintain it.

This will start Ubuntu from the ISO-CD.\nHowever as of today you can save your time downloading Ubuntu 12.04 live-CD for PPC G5-Macs as the offered ISO-CD is showing a blank icon bar with a pink and empty desktop superimposing the 'normal' Ubuntu-Desktop seen on Linux. Only the upper menu bar is showing up.\nI don't understand why this hasn't been tested as there are hundred thousands of PPC-Macs out there, which have been obsoleted because of an Apple infight with PPC-Manufacturers. And I am not the only one who wants to keep the Hardware as long as possible. Apple is still updating Safari and iTunes for these systems. Obsoleting 64bit  2GHZ ++ multiprocessor hardware but trying to still make a buck with us is an argument to turn my back to Apple. And I think there are thousands of other PPC users out there. However Canonical seems not to be interested in those potential users either. \n", "Q: Scale a recipe in krecipes How can I scale recipes in krecipes?\nSuppose I have a recipe in krecipes which is for 4 persons. Now want to scale the amount of incredients that it fits for 3 persons (or even 3.5 if you have 3 adults and one child for example). \n\nA: On their handbook page under Recipe Actions you have two options, scale by yield or scale by factor. It sounds like you want the second one. Look for the Resize recipe button in the edit recipe page. Note that this will change the entire recipe each time you do this. Keep a backup copy of the original in case the scaling back and forth doesn't work out over time.  \nTo request this as a feature, select Help/Report Bug in the menu. Type in your feature request. The KDE help document explaining this in greater detail is here.  \nTo do this now, you need to use one of the many online recipe scaling calculators found through a search.

I just installed Ubuntu 11.10 on a friends Dell Inspiron laptop.  I normally boots up to Windows Vista Home Edition.  As part of the install procedure I reduced the size of the largest ntfs partition to allow space for an ext4 root partition and a small swap partition.  After the install completed it prompted to restart and what followed was a reboot with Windows coming back up without any multiboot menu screen.  Where is the grub boot menu? \n\nA: You'll need to install GRUB manually.

To fix it, you have to either fix the entry (if you know what the right entry should look like) or remove it altogether (that's what I'm going to describe, as it's the fastest way to enable you to update your system again).\n\n\n*\n\n*First, you need to open the file containing the bad entry. The filename is given in the error message, in your example /etc/apt/sources.list.d/some-ppa.list. Open a terminal, and type\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/some-ppa.list\n\nand press Enter. After entering your password, you should now see the file opened in the text editor nano.\n\n*Now you need to locate the malformed entry. It should be on the line number given in the error message - in your case that would be line 1.\n\n*This line should be incomplete and start with the unknown type the update process is complaining about (here ain). Just delete the whole line, and save/close the file with Ctrl+X.\n\n*That's it. You should now be able to successfully run the update process!\n\nIf that entry is all that's in the file, then you can just delete the file. To do this, just open a terminal and run the following command:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/some-ppa.list\n\n\nA: You're experiencing Bug #789859 in the software-properties package.\nThe quick and immediate fix is to open up the file that the error message mentions (in this case /etc/apt/sources.list.d/the-board-team-dev-snapshots-natty.list) and remove the line that says ain.

I was able to download the utility to get the ubuntu image on a flash drive and managed to install it. However, I am having serious problems with apache on the netbook.  I am sitting behind a Cisco e1200 firewall with both my \"working pc\" (a desktop) and \"server\" (the netbook) talking through it.

My bios only lets-me shutdown intel hd card or leave the both on but i want to know if is possbible to completely shutdown without having to access to the bios.( if is possible to turn of without using Vgaswitcheroo even better!)\nMy system is: Acer 3820tg-- intel core i3 350M, 2.26 Ghz L3, Ati Mobility Radeon HD 5470 up to 2138 MB hyper memory, 13,3\" HD LED LCD, 4gb DDR3, SSD corsair 60GB sata 2.\nEDIT:  I now know what is missing on the answers! What only i had to do was:\nI edited  /etc/rc.local file and added the next lines:\n\n\n*\n\n*sleep 6\n\n*echo ON > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\n*echo IGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\n*echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\n\nAnd then save the file and restart. It wasn't need to do anything more. It should be possible to use only the intel card now. By the way, i didn't blacklisted the radeon driver because doing it make my ati card wake up. (use it at your own risk. i only tested in my system)\nSecond edit: For those using this to use the intel card, pay attention because adding the sleep 6 to /etc/rc.local  might disable your sound card making ubuntu only show a dummy card in sound settings (i noticed this problem in ubuntu versions after to 12.04.2 hardware stack enabled version). To fix this you need to remove the sleep 6.\n\nA: You can blacklist its kernel module. You can do that by editing blacklist.conf\nsudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nYou should probably add something like this:\nblacklist fglrx\nblacklist radeon\nalias radeon off\nalias lbm-radeon off\n\nThat will blacklist ATIs proprietary driver (fglrx) as well as its opensource counterpart.\nEdit:\nOk, how about using vgaswitcheroo then?

Press A and hold it while entering BIOS (for example if you enter BIOS with F10, press F10 and A at the same time) and you should see more menus.\nThe advanced mode gives following options for the card: dGPU, iGPU, hybrid.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hybrid option powers on both cards, so after booting Linux will be able to access both and vgaswitcheroo is active and before starting X you can switch to which one you want.\n\n*For me, dGPU-only option does not work - the laptop freezes with a black screen and caps lock led flashing and I have to do a power off, after which everything is back to the default setting - Hybrid.\n\n*iGPU-only works and turns off ATI, so after boot lspci no longer shows ATI card - only Intel works and vgaswitcheroo is not started at all (/sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo directory does not exist at all).\n\nA: In order to actually turn off the card you need to have both intel and radeon loaded so that the vgaswitcheroo infrastructure gets initialised, and then you can run\necho OFF | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nwhich will turn off any GPUs that vgaswitcheroo thinks are unused; in this case, it'll be your Radeon.

I had to convert the OGV to AVI using mencoder in order to have it load in OpenShot successfully.\n\nA: I like to use mpeg2video to record screencasts because it's less CPU intensive. Afterwards I convert to MPEG4 video (not x264) with FAAC audio works because I've found those codecs work well with all of the Linux video editors.\nTo make sure you have all of the codecs you need installed:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra-53 libfaac0\nYou can use this command to convert videos to the editing format:\nffmpeg -i in.ogv -vcodec mpeg4 -acodec libfaac -sameq out.mp4\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 can't detect my video card (nvidia gtx 560) I'm currently using Ubuntu 11.10 and it's a fresh install. I've already installed nvidia drivers through the terminal with sudo apt-get install nvidia-current, but Ubuntu still can't detect my current video card.\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: First, you need to reboot after installing the nvidia driver.\nWhat happens when you run\ngksu nvidia-settings\n\nShould look someting like this\n\n\nA: Try:\nlspci | grep nV\n\nYou should see something like this:\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device 1244 (rev a1)\n01:00.1 Audio device: nVidia Corporation Device 0bee (rev a1)\n\nAnyway, in your image I can see it says \"standard experience\" so your 3d acceleration is working. Try to open jockey:\ngksu jockey-gtk\n\nIt will tell you if your drivers are properly installed.\n", "Q: Wireless on dv1000 works while installing but not while using That's it. When I install ubuntu (and xubuntu) I can use the wireless of the HP dv1000 for download packages, but after the installation is ready and it comes to the real work..fail it is like I wouldnt have a wireless adaptor, there is not any connection or anything where I can see that I have a wireless device...what could be the problem? \n\nA: I have the same computer without dual boot and the WIFI works like a charm, no problem with it. I think that you have to install and activate the correct driver for the wifi (it should be the Broadcom driver, if I remember well), going to Additional drivers (you can search it through the Unity lens).\n", "Q: Where is the login screen wallpaper located? I want to know this because I like the picture used and I'd like to use it elsewhere.  Where is the LightDM login screen wallpaper located in Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: In addition to Wojciech Zylinski's answer, if you want to find the location of a custom wallpaper you've set, you can find it between the <filename></filename> tags in ~/.config/gnome-control-center/backgrounds/last-edited.xml of your home folder.\n\nA: It's stored at:\n/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\n\n\nA: You can also change the login graphic with ubuntu-tweak \"Login Settings\". There's a handy button that sets the background to whatever desktop wallpaper is in use. You can also change the login screen logo there as well. You can get a copy  at http://www.ubuntu-tweak.com.\n", "Q: Failed to parse Adb version -Wrong ELF Class My PC CONFIGURATION :\nUBUNTU 11.10 version 64 bit ,\nECLIPSE 3.7 ,\nANDROID SDK\n I tried hard to remove adb error but itsms not working and showing following Errors:\n/platform-tools/adb:Error While loading Shared libraries  \n\nlibncurses.so.5:wrong ELF class:ELFCLASS64\nI even set all path for android set correctly but it wont works.\n\nA: The elf (executable and link format) problem is due to your setup using amd64 and i386 stuff. The official Android SDK only runs on i386 JVM, so you need to manually specify the i386 JVM on Eclipse.\n\n\n*\n\n*First install the Sun(Oracle) 32-bit JVM. Here is a step-by-step on how to do this:\n\n*Add the JVM to Eclipse. Navigate:\nWindow > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs > Add\n\nPut the location of the JVM. Probably will be /usr/lib/jvm/java7/ (my is /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-sun-1.7.0.01). The external libraries will be automatically added when you put the location of the JVM.\n \n\n*Set the Sun (Oracle) 32-bit JVM as default.\n \n\nA: As Marcos said, it's related to 32bit compatibility on your system.\nAnother solution, quite less elegant i must admit, is to install the 32 bit compatibility on your system :\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\n", "Q: Why can't I import \"pygtk\" with Python 3.2 from PyDev? I have installed Eclipse + PyDev + Python 3.2. Now I have two Python interpreters in PyDev: Python 2.7 and Python 3.2. If I try to execute command import pygtk with 2.7 interpreter it works fine, but with Python 3.2 it raises ImportError: No module named pygtk.\nHow can I get PyGTK to work with Python 3.2?\n\nA: One small addition: python3-gobject was renamed python3-gi in Precise. You can still install via the old name, but if you don't need to support anything older than Precise, use python3-gi in your debian/control.\n\nA: PyGTK has been deprecated in favor of PyGI+GTK. Because of that, a version of PyGTK for Python 3 was never written.\nTo use PyGI+GTK in Python 3, you need to install the python3-gobject package and do\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nFor a quick introduction on porting PyGTK code to PyGI+GTK, see here:\nhttps://live.gnome.org/PyGObject/IntrospectionPorting\nFor a full tutorial, see here:\nhttp://readthedocs.org/docs/python-gtk-3-tutorial/en/latest/index.html\n"]
