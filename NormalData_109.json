["Q: Clickable Gnome-style notifications in Unity I was looking for a way to get gnome style notifications in Unity. Or at least, if thereÂ´s a way of making the default Unity notifications interactive and clickable? As it is by default only a notification pops up and the user needs to find the relevant window, which I find very counterproductive. \n\nA: Sorry, this is not possible. \nUbuntu's notification system, NotifyOSD, as used by Unity, is designed to be un-clickable, in order to simplify the experience and not confuse users. There is no way to change that.\nGnome Shell, on the other hand, uses another built-in notification system that behaves differently to NotifyOSD, as explained in this LXNews article\n\nA: You can have clickable notification with Unity.\nTested with 12.10, 13.04, 13.10, 14.04, 14.10, 16.04 (thanks @ManseUK).\nWhat we want\nNotification are supposed to non-obstrusive, non-disrupting of your train of thought, and provide a shortcut when relevant.\nProblem in Unity (12.04, 12.10 at least)\nDefault notification engine is notify-osd.\n\n\n*\n\n*notifications are not clickable (which hurts efficiency for those that offer to quickly bring you to the place of interest).\n\n*when several happen quickly, they queue and appear only one after the other : no way to see them quickly, you just have to ... wait.\n\n\nSolution\nCurrent XFCE notifications on the other hand implement just that, and they can be used with Unity. I just tested it with a separate account (default config) to rule out any user-specific settings.\nHowto\nHere's how install and use XFCE4's notifications instead of Unity's:\nsudo apt-get install xfce4-notifyd ; sudo apt-get purge notify-osd\n\nTo get immediate effect this may help (else logout/login):\nkillall -v notify-osd\n/usr/lib/*/xfce4/notifyd/xfce4-notifyd &\n\nYou might want to test and adjust appearance:\nxfce4-notifyd-config\n\n\nA: Tested on Ubuntu Unity 18.04\nYou do not need to purge or remove notify-osd to switch to xfce4-notifyd. You can simply change the default notification utility.\nBefore you begin, install xfce4-notifyd by running the following commands:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install xfce4-notifyd\n\nNext, run the following command to edit your default, dbus notification-service configuration file:\nsudo nano /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service\n\nThen, edit the file to look like this:\n[D-BUS Service]\nName=org.freedesktop.Notifications\n# Exec=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/notify-osd\nExec=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xfce4/notifyd/xfce4-notifyd\nSystemdService=xfce4-notifyd.service\n\nIf you notice, the 3rd line is commented out and the last two lines are added to the original file.\nWhen you are done editing, press CTRL+o to save the file and then press CTRL+x to exit nano.\nFinally, reboot to apply the changes.\n", "Q: Programming error in aptdaemon, how to fix it? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCannot install any software from the Software Center due to ttf-mscorefonts-installer package error \n\nI've been trying to install some applications like Skype and Windows, yet same error message keeps showing\n\nThere seems to be a programming error in aptdaemon, the software that allows you to install/remove software and to perform other package management related tasks.\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 968, in simulate\n    trans.unauthenticated = self._simulate_helper(trans)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 1092, in _simulate_helper\n    return depends, self._cache.required_download, \\\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 235, in required_download\n    pm.get_archives(fetcher, self._list, self._records)\nSystemError: E:I wasn't able to locate a file for the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package. \n\n\nThis might mean you need to manually fix this package.\n\nI'm a newbie to Ubuntu and couldn't get it fix.

My folder settings inside the dir are chmod 755 and my files are 644. Should it be owned by www-data or by my username?\nId be glad if you can give me some best practices on this. Thx for advise!\n\nA: The biggest thing I've learned is to not give Apache write access to anything you do not need to write too, for example cache, user, or download directories that you can upload stuff to. \nSo take ownership of everything with something like sudo chown user:user on the website directory and give the o other bit the permissions needed... . \nReplace user:user with a user and group you would like.\nOn the directories you can use a command like:\nsudo chmod o+rx /var/www/'directory' #make directory read and executable for other\nsudo chmod o-wx /var/www/'directory'/'files' #remove write and execute from files\nsudo chmod o+r  /var/www/'directory'/'files' #add read to files\n\nYou can also use a find command that is a little advanced but makes the job a little easier, something like (after having owned the files with):\nchown user:user /var/www/ -R # this is only an example.. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*directories\n\n\nfind /var/www/ -type d -exec sudo chmod o+rx {} \\; \n\n\n\n*\n\n*files\n\n\nfind /var/www/ -type f -exec sudo chmod o-wx {} \\;\nfind /var/www/ -type f -exec sudo chmod o+r {} \\;\n\nI tried to be as descriptive as possible.

I did not have to do that when I had OSX installed on it.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: A lot of people with Macbook varieties have installed alternate drivers for the trackpad so they can modify them to their hearts' content.  In my case, I installed xf86-input-mtrack driver.  To install it, at the terminal type:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-mtrack  \n\nPut in password as usual when prompted.\nNow you need to actually switch from the old driver (called \"multitouch\") to this one.  You will need to put some entries in /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nsudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf \n\nPut in:\n    Section \"InputClass\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad          \"on\"\n        Identifier               \"Touchpads\"\n        Driver                   \"mtrack\"\n    EndSection\n\nThis is the bare minimum you need in the conf file.  You will undoubtedly want to now experiment and tweak it until the driver gets to the Goldilocks \"just right\" stage.\nHere is the readme by the author of the driver:  https://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack/blob/master/README.md\nIt explains the different options.  Here's an example, using my conf:\n     Section \"InputClass\"\n          MatchIsTouchpad    \"on\"\n          Identifier         \"Touchpads\"\n          Driver             \"mtrack\"\n          Option             \"Sensitivity\"           \".67\"\n          Option             \"TapButton1\"            \"0\"\n          Option             \"TapButton2\"            \"0\"\n          Option             \"TapButton3\"            \"0\"\n          Option             \"ScrollDistance\"        \"100\"\n          Option             \"FingerHigh\"            \"8\"\n          Option             \"FingerLow\"             \"8\"\n      EndSection\n\nI don't like any of the tapping business, so I turned them off.  FingerHigh is what you are most interested in.  Default value is 5.  It defines the minimum pressure the touchpad will recognize as a touch.  As you can see, I found it very sensitive, so I set it to 8.\nNow reboot.  If all goes well, you've fixed your problem.  It's that easy (or at least, it should be -- knock on wood).  \nFinally, a discussion thread started by the driver author is here:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1730361\nA fair amount of the info in there is outdated, not applicable, or in some cases wrong (some examples of the xorg.conf files mistakenly have \"multitouch\" where \"mtrack\" should be).  But the initial post is worth reading as it explains the author created dispad to work with the driver, for those who accidentally touch trackpad a lot while typing.  I don't have that problem, so I didn't install dispad, but maybe you will need it.\n", "Q: Autodim does not un-dim when I start using the computer again On my MacBook 2,1 with Ubuntu 11.10, whenever I leave the computer alone for five minutes, it blacks out and wont respond to any keypresses or even the power button.\nUPDATE: It was the autodim feature that didn't un-dim itself after starting to use the computer again. Why is that?\n\nA: I ran into a very similar issue (couldn't resume from suspend). It's apparently a recognized bug in the 3.0 kernel.  I updated to 12.04 (alpha 2), which uses kernel version 3.2, and it fixed the problem.  3.0 is also known for being inefficient power-wise.  I gained more than an hour of battery life from moving up to 3.2.\n", "Q: Windows 7 can't find CUPS printer shared from Ubuntu I have Ubuntu 11.10 on one computer and Windows 7 on another. The Ubuntu computer has a printer attached, and I want to add this printer to the Windows 7 computer. Printing locally works. The problem is that Windows is not able to see the shared printer, so I cannot add it. \nI am guessing that some Ubuntu setting / software is still missing, but what exactly?\nHow can I make Windows add this printer?\n\n\n*\n\n*In the CUPS web front-end, the checkbox Share printers connected to this system is checked. I'm not sure whether the checkbox Allow printing from the Internet  needs to be checked also; I've tried both settings, and neither worked. \n\n*On Windows, I can connect to the CUPS web front-end and see the printer listed (see screenshot below). And yet, when I add that printer URL, Windows complains that it cannot connect to the printer.\n\n*The Ubuntu computer is a fresh install. I already have full write access on Windows shares, so something of this kind must be preconfigured out-of-the-box. I have not installed or changed any applications or settings regarding Samba or smb.conf. Do I need to do anything in this regard (on Ubuntu 11.10!) or is that obsolete or already included and fully configured? \n\n*Googling for this problem gives me plenty of material dated 2005-2009 but nothing newer. I don't think that's still valid in 2012 and I don't want to mess up my new installation with outdated instructions. Via one of the comments I came to this page about network printing from Windows but it does not specify whether Samba is already installed -- or which Samba to install, because searching in the Ubuntu Software Center yields several results.\n\n\nA: Well, I finally got it working. It turns out there are several parts that need to work together (of course). But here's a way that requires zero work in terminal:\n1) Setup Samba:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install \"system-config-samba\".\n\n*Launch \"Samba\" from the launcher.\n\n*Open \"Preferences\" > \"Server Settings\" and enter the workgroup name used in Windows.\n\n\n2) Share printer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://localhost:631/admin/ and check the box \"Share printers connected to this system\".\n\n*Go to http://localhost:631/printers/ and check that the expected printer is listed.\n\n*Click the printer and check that it is listed as \"Idle, Accepting Jobs, Shared, Server Default\".\n\n\n3) Connect the printer:\nDo either of these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Windows computer, open Windows Explorer and go to the \"Network\" item. There's an icon for the Ubuntu computer; open it. There's an icon for the printer shared from Ubuntu. Right-click that one and select \"Connect...\".\n\n*On the Windows computer, select \"Add new printer\" then \"Connect to a printer on the Internet or network\" and specify the full path of \"http://{computername}:631/printers/{printername}\"\n\n\nThen go to the printer properties and set it up with the desired defaults.\n\nA: Windows drivers must be uploaded through Windows Explorer unlike Linux drivers which are installed on Linux filesystems.  \nYou may either \n\n\n*\n\n*use a PS driver on Windows and a specific driver in CUPS or\n\n*use a specific driver in Windows and the Raw (which actually means transparent) driver in CUPS \n\n", "Q: dell vostro 1000 broadcom wireless connection I have a problem with the hardware broadcom wifi. \nI press the hotkey fn+f2 to activate the hardware and this will not work. \nI'll look at the drivers but it appears to be installed. \nHow can I solve this problem?

People had tried opening them and jumping two leads (maybe from a flaky switch?) to no avail. If you still have this drive and it's still in warranty I'd return it and get a replacement.\nI hate to break the bad news to you =\\ but it appears you're out of luck in this situation as everything I've read points to hardware failure.\nEdit 05/27/2016: I experienced an issue personally with a flash drive flaking out on me recently. In my case, this was a Corsair Flash Voyager 128GB that started slowing down pretty drastically on me. While it didn't show the symptoms noted here, it occasionally would not mount and showed up as a \"Silicon Power\" device. This was a result of the drive having accrued a large amount of bad sectors and dropping into diagnostic/programming mode. Since this is one of my more popular answers and this also falls into the category of \"failing flash drives,\" I figured I'd include it here for reference.\nUpdate 2: Regarding that Corsair Flash Voyager, I sent mine in for an RMA, only to have my second one fail on me in the same fashion. The problem actually turned out to be mechanical. The sliding mechanism seems to put a small amount of pressure on the PCB. Ordinarily, this wouldn't have caused an issue in the normal life span of the device. But for this particular model, it seems to have had weak solder joints that the pressure from the sliding action exacerbated -- leading to oxidation in the cracked joint and eventual failure. Rather than doing yet another RMA, I took matters into my own hands. I opened the case, shaved some of the plastic casing away to give the PCB some wiggle room and then reflowed the NAND chip to repair the broken solder joints. It's working great to this day!\n\nA: Well, this is a bit of a bummer.\nI tried everything here & elsewhere & nothing worked.\nFormatted it on a friend's Windows laptop-- works fine now. FFS!\nSigh....(wondering now if I might've been able to fix it in my Win 7 VM on my Mint desktop instead?).\n\nA: using fdisk -l locate the drive, ie: /dev/sdc1\nnow \numount /dev/sdc1\n\nFinally, reformat the flash-drive\nsudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdc1\nI found this quick and easy. Be sure to UNMOUNT the drive before trying to format.\n\nA: None of these answers provided so far are correct.  \nTo actually make it work, you can override the detection of the USB disk announcing its read-only with a USB quirks setting.  Here's how it works.\n1) Plug in the USB device and do an lsusb, example:\n$ lsusb\nBus 002 Device 012: ID 0781:5583 SanDisk Corp. \n\n2) Take note of those two codes between the colon (called the idVendor and idProduct). Unplug the USB device.\n3) Remove the usb_storage kernel module (assuming it's compiled as a module)\n$ sudo modprobe -r $(lsmod | sed -n 's:,: :g ; s,^usb_storage[ 0-9]*,,p') usb_storage\n\n4) Now we will put the module back in using a quirks mode setting to override the detection of the device's write-only flag.\nFrom source/drivers/usb/storage/usb.c#L572 taken from v4.19 you can see that the quirks mode setting we're looking for is w. Here's how we'll reload the kernel module:\n$ sudo modprobe usb_storage quirks=0781:5583:w\n\nReplace the numbers between the colons with the ones your saw in step (1) from above.\n5) plug the usb storage device back in. We can now confirm with dmesg that this worked:\nBefore:\n\nAnd after:\n\nAlso after issuing a mount command you'll see:\n/dev/sdb1 on /usb type ext4 (rw,relatime)\nNow go get your stuff off that disk immediately, it's failing.\n\nA: Angel's answer is good, but the actual commands weren't so easy for me.  This is what worked :\nPlug in the card (mine is an SD card with a manual write-protect switch on it, but the switch is off and it is writable on a Windows machine).\nUbuntu mounted it automatically on /media/andrew/6AB0-1FD91, and dmesg showed the partition to be /dev/sdb1.\nUnmount it, and make it writeable \nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\nsudo hdparm -r0 /dev/sdb\n\nCreate a new mount point and mount it there (my userID from /etc/passwd is 1000)\nsudo mkdir /media/andrew/temp\nsudo mount -o uid=1000 /dev/sdb1 /media/andrew/temp\n\nit'll still complain that it's read-only. I don't know why I had to change this flag before AND after mounting, but that's the only way it worked for me.  Set it to writeable again, and remount it at the same place\nsudo hdparm -r0 /dev/sdb1\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdb1\n\nNow I can write to the disk as my normal user.  I'm being very careful with it in case it is actually failing, but those commands allowed me to finish what I was doing. \n\nA: This happens when the ISO file was burned to usb using the DD command or any of the \"standard\" tools.\nIf it's created like this, there's no way to make it writable.\nThe way to do it is to burn the ISO using some tool such as unetbootin (linux) or Roofus (Windows).\n\nA: To turn off disk device`s write protect, we use the low level system utility hdparm like this:\nsudo apt-get install hdparm    \nsudo hdparm -r0 /dev/sdb\n\nwhere we asume that /dev/sdb is the Physical disk device we're working on.\nIf the device has partitions that are mounted as read-only, you should re-mount 'em as read-write in order to write data to them.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Insert memory stick and start gparted. Select it via the button at top right. It should be obvious if you are inspecting your memory stick (Size is a good clue). Select Partition--> unmount.\nSelect 'Device' at top, then 'Create Partition Table' and take the default, which is msdos.\nNow you should be able to create a new partition and format it f32. If you can't, it's probably bust.\nHTH\n", "Q: Can't start ubuntu 11.10, Stops at login screen! I have been trying to dual boot ubuntu with windows 7 via WUBI on my custom built pc\nbut without success. When i start the computer i can choose windows or ubuntu i choose ubuntu and when i should get to the login screen the screen just stays purple/pink. Tried safe mode but cant get in there either.

Basically I need only the answer to above question. Please think of that I am new to linux.\nFor further explanation here is the full story:\nI have the following problem. My friends notebook (Vista) has got a trojan and refuses to work anymore. The Avira Rescue CD did not help either. So I tried an old (9.1) Ubuntu CD and backed up all the essential files. Since we have no Windows Install Disk we want to put Ubuntu on that notebook. But with the 9.1 version there is no WLAN. Systemtest tells me, that it finds an Atheros AR928X, but ifconfig does not show that and the network manager tells me there are no LAN/WLAN devices. So: does that work easier with the new Ubuntu version or is that network adapter a known troublemaker? \nAnd: if I get the adapter to work, will it work with the WPA2-network around here?\n\nA: Yeah, it will work. ath9k supports WPA and WPA PSK2.\n", "Q: How to watch movies compressed into .bin and .cue?

Does Thunderbird need re-installing?  Or is it a U1 problem?\n\nA: 11.10\nStarting with Ubuntu 11.10, the default email application is Thunderbird. Ubuntu One contacts sync has integration with Thunderbird in Ubuntu 11.10.\nThe following instructions explain how to setup contacts sync in Ubuntu 11.10 with Thunderbird and use Ubuntu One contacts in Thunderbird.\nSetup contacts sync\n\n*\n\n*Open the Ubuntu One Control Panel\n\n*Click on the services tab\n\n*Click the \"Install now\" button\n\n*Enter your Ubuntu password when prompted\n\n*Click the \"Install now\" button under the \"Enable Contacts Sync\" section\n\nCopy contacts to Ubuntu One from Thunderbird\n\n\n*Open Thunderbird\n\n\n*Click on the \"Address Book\" button\n\n\n*Click on the \"Personal Address Book\"\n\n\n*Select all the contacts you want to copy\n\n\n*While holding the \"Ctrl\" key, move the contacts from the \"Personal Address Book\" onto the \"Ubuntu One\" address book\nAuto-complete email address from the Ubuntu One address book\n\n\n*Open Thunderbird\n\n\n*Click the \"Edit\" menu and select \"Preferences\"\n\n\n*Click on the \"Composition\" icon\n\n\n*Click on the \"Addressing\" tab\n\n\n*Click on the checkbox next to \"Directory Server\" and select \"Ubuntu One\" from the pull down menu\n\n\n*Click the \"Close\" button\nSource\n\nUpdate\nI must admit I couldn't get it to work myself but after a bit of digging around I found that CouchDB address book intergration is not compatible with Thunderbird 9.0, unfortunately that's why you get no option to select Ubuntu One as a directory server - it relies on CouchDB!!\nSee below screenshot\n\n\nA: I believe Ubuntu One stopped syncing contacts in 2011 - so it says at the base of FAQ webpage, so I guess we can't sync with Thunderbird:\n\nAs of June 1, 2011 the current Ubuntu One contacts sync for mobile will no longer be active.

I have been using the default Ubuntu 11.10 with Unity for some time now and decided to start customizing it.\nI have already been able to make some changes with the gnome-tweak-tool. However, there are many themes that I get from gnome-look.org that don't appear in the gnome-tweak-tool even after putting them in the /usr/share/themes folder.\nAny idea why this is happening? Thanks.\n\nA: I installed a few themes from gnome-look.org\nThe site uses a special URL scheme. The URL handler comes in a package named ocs-url. Here are the instructions for installing the URL handler on linux-apps.com.\nHowever, the installation method described on this site has an issue: it marks the dependencies as manually installed.\nTherefore I recommend the following method instead.\nMy method will ensure that, when you uninstall ocs-url, its dependencies will be automatically uninstalled as well.\nFirst download the ocs-url Debian package, then (filename and directory name might differ):\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i ocs-url_3.1.0-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get install --fix-broken\n\nOnce this is done, all you have to do is click on install links on gnome-look.org and them click \"OK\" and the themes will be installed in ~/.themes. \nRestart the Tweaks tool and your new themes should be available.\nTested on Debian.\n\nA: How to install themes in Ubuntu:\nWhen you download a theme for Ubuntu this come compressed into a .tar.gz file almost always. What you have to do is:\n\n*\n\n*Run the terminal Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Enter cd ~ && mkdir .themes\nThis command will create a .themes folder in your personal folder. The dot is necessary\n\n*Enter cp files_path ~/.themes\nReplace files_path with the directory where are your zipped files. This command copy the compressed files into this folder.\n\n*Enter cd ~/.themes && tar xvzf PACKAGENAME.tar.gz\nReplace PACKAGENAME with the name of the file. This command will unzip the theme file into the new folder.\n\n*Enter gnome-tweak-tool\nFinally will appears the tweak window (similar as the following) and you'll see the themes that you've previously copy in the themes folder and will be able to choice them!\n\nFor future themes, omit the second step\n\nA: I had the same problem when placing themes in /usr/share/themes. You need to make sure the permissions are set correctly.\nRight click on the folder of your theme and select properties, go to the permissions tab and set it like this:\n\nNow go back to gnome tweak tool and your theme should be there. Alternatively, you could create ~/.theme and put your theme in there.\n", "Q: Can I remove/ uninstall \"Toggle Desktop\"? This is where I found out how to install it.\nI tried sudo apt-get remove wmctrl but it did not work, even after reboot. I could not find anything on the Internet. \n\nIt is the icon on the left, with the gears. Maybe there is a way to remove any of these icon (The Toggle Desktop)? Ones in the top bar? For the record I'm using Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: This is the indicator author. To remove the icon from the panel you need only remove the app from \"startup applications\" as listed above. I personally use Ctrl+Alt+D to toggle the desktop. It is faster. \n\nA: The installation instructions state:\n\nTo use it, firstly install wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThen, download the archive from here, extract it and double click\n  the \"desktop-indicator.py\" file.\nTo add Desktop Indicator to startup, search for \"Startup Applications\"\n  in Dash (or access it via the session menu - top right icon), click\n  \"Add\", under \"Name\" enter \"Desktop Indicator\" and under \"Command\"\n  click \"Browse\" and select \"desktop-indicator.py\" from where you've\n  extracted the downloaded archive.\n\nTherefore to remove the indicator - at a minimum, would be to remove the application you have added via \"Startup Applications\" i.e.\nsearch for \"Startup Applications\" in Dash (or access it via the session menu - top right icon), highlight \"Desktop Indicator\" and click the remove button.\nLogout and login.\n", "Q: Firefox update fails with \"not found\" error I got 3 update notifications for firefox:\n\nYet when I click update, it fails with a \"not found\" error:\n\nAny idea why this is?

How can I access it? Sorry if this is a such an obvious question, but where does Ubuntu put documentation packages for python, node.js, redis, mysql, mongodb, and other applications?\nAnd why I cannot access it by typing python-doc in the terminal?\n\nA: To examine help for all installed modules\n\n:~#python\n>>>help()\nhelp>modules word_in_modulname\nhelp>module_name\nhelp>quit\n>>>help('module_name')\n>>>dir('module_or_class')\n\nis how you do it in the python shell.  One of those generates the output that shows you\nwhere to point a web browser for the docs.  \n\npydoc -p portnumber\n\nMight be what you were looking for.  I'm assuming the answer wasn't sufficient yet.  \nIf you want a gui, you might enjoy the package devhelp.\n\nA: Since you have already installed python-doc, you can run dpkg --listfiles python-doc to get a list of all the files installed with that package.  On my system, the place to start is /usr/share/doc/python-doc/html/index.html.  This is simply a local copy of the documentation available online at http://docs.python.org. You can also download the documentation from http://docs.python.org/download.html, and save them in various formats anywhere you would like.\nSo, in general, doc packages go in /usr/share/doc. Typing python-doc in a terminal doesn't work because it is not the name of a command.  The pydoc command can be useful, but a good option for you might be to make a link to the index.html file that came with the python-doc package, and put it somewhere convenient.\n", "Q: Login Problem after changing some settings I have done some operations at the same time as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Created a new general account. \n\n*Changed the password of super user to empty.\n\n*Set auto login for super user.\n\n\nAfter restarting my system, I am facing following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not able to login through my super user, it come back to same welcome screen.\n\n*I am able to login with general user, but in that account I am not able to login through Super User.\n\n\nHow can I correct this?\n\nA: root is not designed for auto login, it was designed for password login.  Remove auto login for root, and this should resolve your issues.\n\nA: Root account is not for logging in. You can gain super user privileges by using sudo, gksu or su root. You shouldn't play with your system  like this unless you are pro user. Changing root, wheel, /etc/sudoers or any similar thing without proper knowledge may break your system and it'll be hard to repair it.\nAlso, root account without password is like big label \"viruses and hackers come here\".\nTry to restore everything to a previous state.

It might not boot properly on your physical machine or another hypervisor. \nAnd a plain Ubuntu Server install doesn't use 4-500MB RAM per se. Linux will try to not waste any memory if it can, and some memory will show up as being in use, but that doesn't mean the memory is blocked. To Linux, \"free\" means \"wasted\". You'll have no problems running Ubuntu Server with 64MB RAM, for instance. A VPS hosting company will often want to go to rather extreme lengths to reduce the memory use because of things like ballooning, which means you can have more virtual machines using the same amount of physical RAM, etc and then oversell the hardware. As a normal user, you really don't want to do that. \n", "Q: dependency errors after installing hedgewars I was installing Hedgewars game on my Ubuntu and then something happened. I don't remember.

Due to the fact I'm using OpenGL many graphics features are not available which means basically that my FPS should be a lot higher.\nI'm using Wine 1.4 RC1.\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: Do not expect the same performance using Wine compared with Windows. Wine as you probably know is used to emulate all layers necessary to run Windows applications, it will never be the same as you have in a Windows system.\nFor increasing the FPS I would suggest running all your gaming sessions under Unity2D, that is important because you do not have the composite desktop taking part of your graphics card performance.\nFor World of Warcraft as you said changing from D3D to OpenGL helps in most cases bit in the end you will have to eventually lower the graphic details options to run the game.\nTry a lower resolution, decrease the graphic details a bit and them some more until you are happy with the performance.\nWhen I played World of Warcraft on my Ubuntu system I noticed 2 things always: lag and ping to server was much better and graphics quality always had to be much lower than the one I used in Windows.\n", "Q: Banshee cannot see an audio CD If I insert an audio CD into my computer nothing happens.

Suppose you want to resize the disk to 20,000 megabytes (~20GB). First locate the disk file that you want to expand. Then, in terminal, give this command to resize the disk:\nVBoxManage modifyhd \"path-of-disk-file\" --resize 20000\n\nTo enlarge the partition and file system, probably it's easiest to boot the virtual machine using a Ubuntu livecd and do the job with GParted, as it does both at the same time and gives you a graphical user interface for it.\nAttach a livecd ISO image to the virtual machine and change the boot order to first boot from CD. If you don't have a Ubuntu livecd at hand you can use any livecd that comes with the appropriate tools. SliTAZ for example is only 35MB to download. Open GParted and choose the disk you want to resize. Then right-click on the partition that you want to expand and choose the option \"resize-move.\" In the dialog box that opens, in the graphic that represents the partition, drag the triangle at the end of the partition all the way to the right to maximize it. Then close the dialog and choose \"Apply\" on the toolbar. Since no data has to be moved this should be a quick operation.\nWhen done, don't forget to detach the livecd from the virtual machine and change the boot order.\nYou'll find a pretty good tutorial of the whole process with screenshots included here: http://trivialproof.blogspot.com/2011/01/resizing-virtualbox-virtual-hard-disk.html\n", "Q: Does Ubiquity respect my former partition layout with a new installation? If I have had two partition on my laptop ever since I use Linux. One for root and another for home. \nWhat does ubiquity do if I ask it to replace previous installation of Ubuntu with a new one? Will it install everything to / (root) or will it respect my partition scheme and take home partition as /home?\n\nA: In my experience, upgrading or  replacing my previous Ubuntu installation disregarded my previous partitioning method and built it's own (using ext4 of course). \nI would go on the custom partition step, then select the partitions one by one (the size of the partitions are the same as the old installation), assign a filesystem, and check 'format' on each of them except swap space (if you have it). And remember to assign the correct device for boot-loader installation!\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I would consider it a severe bug if it detected your old Ubuntu installation, offered to perform automatic actions based on that knowledge and then disregarded the mount points defined in /etc/fstab on the old system root. But I haven't tried it myself, so I can't tell you that it works. I would be extremely surprised if it didn't. \n\nA: Ubiquity gives you a choice about what you want to do with your partitions. If you use manual partitioning, you can reuse your existing partition layout. This is what I do. I am able to reuse my existing /home as the /home partition for the new install. And I can choose to format that partition or not. \nI have reused existing partition layouts on new Ubuntu installs several times with both Ext4 and btrfs filesystems. It works exactly as expected. No surprises and no problems (as long as you are familiar with partitioning, which it sounds like you are). Just use manual partitioning when you get to that step in Ubiquity.\n\nWhat does ubiquity do if I ask it to replace previous installation of Ubuntu with a new one?\n\nOn the other hand, if you are expecting it to automagically reuse your partitions with all the default installation choices, it will not do that. It will install everything to / (root).\n", "Q: Ubuntu not starting up following crash This afternoon my headless ubuntu machine seemed to dissapear from the network. COuldnt ping it, SSH sessions that were ongoing suddenly died.\nI rebooted the machine and...nothing. A few seconds of drive activity and then the machine just sits there. I connected it up to a monitor, and I can see the BIOS come up, check for a bootable CD, and then seemingly try to boot from the HDD, but nothing happens.\nI suspect that I might be in the wrong place here, as it may well not be a ubuntu issue - I boot into a livecd, and mount the drive and look in /var/logs, and can see nothing at all since the last time I rebooted, several days ago. Its as if the BIOS has 'lost' the install.\nIve confirmed the partition is marked bootable, and reinstalled/reconfigured grub, but nothing.\nAny ideas/suggestions?\n\nA: Boot from live cd, do disk checks on the disk, make sure that the disk is healthy, and does not have too many bad blocks/sectors.\nIf the disk checks out fine, and if the system you have is running at least 11.04 or greater, use the installer, and do an upgrade install.\nThis will keep all your data safe.  It will simply replace the entire OS, and Grub, running a fresh grub configuration.  It will then re-install any and all downloaded applications, updates, drivers, etc.  This should at least get the system booting again, assuming that the crash was not caused by a damaged driver that was downloaded.  If it was caused by a package being damaged because it was not fully downloaded or installed, this will fix the issue.  If it was caused by some part of the system getting corrupted, then this also should fix that.\nAccording to what you said, you reinstalled grub.

Repositories systems in place to make sure that the software you download will work on your computer. In windows when you want to install an application to fix a problem, you have to trust not only the website that's hosting it, but all the computers in between.\nWith key signing, you can be sure that you are installing software that the developers intended for you to install.\nThat just leaves the issues to you, to make sure that you chose good developers.\n\nA: Downloading from a repo with apt-get install will also make sure all of the dependencies are installed.\n\nA: Simply, when you install an application from a .deb file, you won't get package updates like you do when you install from a repository.\n\nA: The repository will keep you sofware up-to-date and install the dependencies as well.

I'm having to get a copy of Windows XP from the nether regions of the net and want to run it through a virtualbox.  Would that be safer as to a WINE installation? Safer as in \"not possible to get any infections?\"\nAny help is appreciated.\n(The only reason I'm getting a copy off the net is because I can't find my old copy of the XP disc - that's why I'm going this route)\n\nA: Just to clarify, WINE is not actually used to install Windows. You don't need a windows installation to use WINE and windows programs under WINE. It can be considered to be an independent compatibility layer for windows programs.\nIf for any reason WINE won't do what you need it to, and you need to install windows, then Virtualbox is absolutely the best option for you. Windows will be completely separated from Ubuntu, so even if you pick up a virus or other threat while running Windows, it won't have any impact on your Ubuntu install. \nAlso as an aside, technically speaking it's very very difficult for windows malware to work under WINE but under certain circumstances it might be possible. \n\nA: I think that Windows malware will not work under Wine , it must be specially designed for Wine because Linux dont have same comands as Windows but still if there will be some Wine malware it will not mess with your system only with your files in user home folder.\n", "Q: How can I execute a .jar file from the terminal I know that to execute a file, I use the . command, then the file name with a space between them.

If your Ubuntu version / flavour supports it, you should be able to right click on your \".jar\" file's directory and click \"Open in Terminal\"\n\n*Type the following command:\njava -jar jarfilename.jar\n\nThis way your \".jar\" file will execute.\n\nA: Install jarwrapper. After that (and by adding the executable bit) you can start the jar file just by entering the jarfile name.\nsudo apt-get install jarwrapper\n\nThis works by using binfmt to add support for a new binary format to the kernel.\n\nA: Linux is perfectly capable of running a foreign binary, like a JAR file. This is how Wine works, for example. To run JAR files as executable do the following in a console\nsudo apt-get install binfmt-support\n\nCd to your JAR file and change it to executable (you can also do this through file properties in Nautilus)\nchmod a+rx myjar.jar\n\nRun your jar file just as if it was any other binary executable or shell script\n./myjar.jar\n\nNote: Be sure you have binfmt_misc linux kernel module loaded. If you use your custom compiled kernel without this module, binfmt-support won't work.\n\nA:  java -jar /home/username/.minecraft/launcher.jar\n\n\nA: The . syntax can only be used to run (by \"sourcing\") shell scripts.\nYou'll need to use the java command to run a .jar file:\njava -jar Minecraft.jar\n\nIf you don't have java installed, you can fix that by installing the default-jreÂ¹ package. You can see if you already have java installed by running in a terminal:\njava -version \n\n[1]: This will install the default openjdk Java runtime. You can use openjdk-8-jre, or openjdk-7-jre, or openjdk-6-jre instead, if you prefer - whichever is available on your version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: If it is an executable jar, then\njava -jar Minecraft.jar \n\nNot all jar-Archives contain an executable class, declared to be started in the Manifest file, but if there is, this will work.\nBtw.: You don't start most programs from the shell with the dot. The dot is a shortcut for source, and it only works in the bash and some other shells, to include a script in the scope of the current session. \nA compiled binary xybin is simply started with its name if it is in the path: \nxybin \n\nor, with its absolute path:\n/home/foo/proj/test/xybin\n\nor with its relative path:\nproj/test/xybin\n\nor if you happen to be in the directory of the file, with this relative path: \n./xybin\n\nThe file has to be marked executable for you (see: chmod).\nAll of the above is true for shellscripts too, but they often have an extension .sh, and you can start a shellscript by invoking the interpreter, and then it needn't be marked executable: \n bash xy.sh\n\nIf you don't want to start a new bash, you can use source, and you do so, to consume function definitions, aliases and variable settings. \n\nA: New answer to an old question\nExecuting a jar file using the regular syntax ./app.jar (instead of java -jar), is easy to achieve, as explained here: how to create executable jars.\nBasically, JAR is a variant of ZIP, which allows random bytes to be pre/appended to the JAR without corrupting it. This means it is possible to prepend a launcher script at the beginning of the jar to make it \"executable\".\nHere is a simple example of turning a \"normal\" jar into an executable one:\n# Append a basic launcher script to the jar\ncat \\\n  <(echo '#!/bin/sh')\\\n  <(echo 'exec java -jar $0 \"$@\"')\\\n  <(echo 'exit 0')\\\n  original.jar > executable.jar\n\n# Make the new jar executable\nchmod +x executable.jar\n\nWith this, you can now run ./executable.jar instead of java -jar original.jar. This works on all unix like systems including Linux, MacOS, Cygwin, and Windows Linux subsystem.\n\nA: if u want to install your jar with specific java version\nSpecify the java directory also\n/scratch/app/product/Software/jdk1.8.0_112/bin/java -jar /path-to-jar/Minecraft.jar\n\n", "Q: How can I increase resolution when impossible to set up nvidia driver?

I have a laptop, a desktop, and a spare 5' Ethernet cable that I can use to directly connect one to the other. The desktop freezes every few days or so, seemingly at random, and when it happens I want to be able to ssh into it as mentioned here so I can make a proper bug report and get this fixed.\nUnfortunately, the linked guide doesn't give any instructions on how to do this. Can someone provide a step-by-step answer on how to ssh from my laptop into my desktop when the latter freezes, and also how to conveniently retrieve the necessary files once logged in to attach to the bug report?\nA couple things to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using standard desktop Ubuntu installs on both systems. If there's any extra packages I need installed beforehand, let me know.\n\n*My machines each have only a single Ethernet port; the desktop uses this for its wired-only Internet connection, and my laptop on the other hand uses an 802.11n WiFi connection. Only one machine can use the wired connection at a time due to network restrictions in my dorm, and the wireless connection my laptop uses is very unreliable. Thus, answers should preferably not depend on a working Internet connection, but rather a direct connection between the two machines, if that's possible.\n\n*I've never logged into one of my own machines from another of my own before, so assume I know nothing and be sure to provide plenty of details. :)\n\n\nA: To establish basic network connectivity between two computers, it's much easier to connect computers using a SOHO network switch (something equivalent to, say, a Linksys SE1500) and then assign static IP addresses to each host. This is a more flexible and robust configuration than a direct link. Definitely worth the ~40 bucks.\nIf direct link is the only option, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1543087 has details. The use of a cross-over cable may not be a hard requirement if both computers support Auto-MDIX.\nThe SSH wiki page should tell you what you need to get SSH running on your desktop. Once you've got a SSH connection established, you can just copy the required files to a known location like your home directory with cp.

There are also a number of links to tutorials on the tag wiki. The way that I learned packaging, and that I like to suggest to others, is to simply look at packages like yours. apt-get source something similar and learn by example.\nThough, let me start you off in the right direction.

I am debugging a curious issue with the kernel not supporting my laptop completely. \n(This is my bug report)\nI have installed the mainline builds from the mainline kernel ppa (http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/), and discovered that the last working kernel version is v3.2.1. Anything after it, i.e. v3.2.2, breaks. So I was going to use the git bisect tool to identity the specific commit between v3.2.1 and v3.2.2 which breaks on my laptop. \nI followed the instructions but the git repo they link to doesn't have the tags for v3.2.x, so I found another one which sounds official and has the right tags: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary, but after building v3.2.1 I still had the issue.\nSo, what git repo do the mainline kernels come from?\nAlso, are any patches/changes applied to them after being retrieved from the repository which wouldn't be in my build?\n\nA: The mainline builds are built from the official upstream repositories (linus's tree and gregkh's stable tree for instance).  Where the build claims to be against a tag it is the official tag from that version.  You can confirm you have the right one using the file COMMIT in the same directory as the binary .debs, this lists the SHA1 or tag which was used as a base for the build, all patches applied to the tree are in the same directory.\n", "Q: Set up eth0 network interface using DHCP in initramfs I created my own initramfs script (based on live-initramfs) and I need set up network connection (using DHCP) to get remote file. \nSo what do I need to add to initramfs hook file (ifconfig, dhclient?).\nAnd how to write my initramfs script?\nNow I am trying something like this:\nmkdir -p /var/run/network  # needed by ifup\nmodprobe af_packet         # for DHCP?\nudevadm trigger            \nudevadm settle  \nifup eth0                  #???            \n\nfor ifup I need /etc/network/interfaces file to have:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nBut generally I don't know what exactly need to be done for network device to work properly in initramfs.\nAny idea or help? \n\nA: The simplest solution is to use ipconfig via the kernel's ip= command-line option in grub.cfg (or pxelinux.cfg or however you boot your kernel).  I'm not aware of a man page for it, but there is a README.ipconfig file in the klibc Git repository and installed at /usr/share/doc/klibc-utils/README.ipconfig.gz.  So your /etc/default/grub might have a line such as the following:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"ip=:::::eth0:dhcp\"\n\nYou may need to make a simple script in /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top that sources the functions file and then calls the configure_networking function, like so:\n#!/bin/sh\n. /scripts/functions\nconfigure_networking\n\n(I had mistakenly thought configure_networking was called by default, but something has to explicitly call itâeither your own script or one from a package.

What if the USB drives are not supported in VirtualBox?\nEdit:\nCurrently I'm trying to create .vmi file directly from the partition (not the iso). But probably I'll encounter somple problems during booting, caused by the grub installed on the other partition.\n\nA: With Virtual Box there is a set of commands that enable us to get direct raw access to harddisk or harddisk partitions (see Virtual Box Manual for details). \nBefore we test this it is strongly recommended to backup your drive.\nThese commands can also be used to boot a virtual machine from a physical drive where a preinstalled OS may reside. In theory the commands should also work for USB drives attached to the host but I have not tested this, so be careful.\n\nIn any case where a virtual machine has physical raw access to a drive make sure you don't access this drive from the host as this may lead to unrecoverable data loss.\n\n\nA: USB is somewhat a standard, and it is supported in Virtual Box. However sometimes it requires additional installation of Guest Additions and VB extension pack.\nIn my opinion if you have BOOTABLE iso image of this system there should be absolutely no problem in moving it to VB.\nBut I must stress that I have never done something like that before, therefore you should wait for an answer of someone, who had sucessfully done it and will be able to guide you in case of any problems.\nRegards\nedited:\nThe simpliest and most robust way is to secure all the data and to install your system on VB from scratch, and then to copy that data. But it may cause a problem with license - because in fact your Windows will be instaled on a different machine then it was and so on. \nMaybe first try to remove grub and existing Ubuntu (if possible) and then make an image. Other way is to leave your windows bootable partition and make an image of just the Windows itself, but in such case there is a rough way ahead of you to make a bootable partition on VB manually.\n", "Q: \"Package dependencies cannot be resolved\" error when installing software Iam getting a problem while install media player packages.\nPackage dependencies cannot be resolved\nThis error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable.

I remember reading that servers do not have a GUI because X11 is a security risk. Why?\n\nA: Ubuntu's community documentation explains the real reasons why it's not recommended to run a GUI on a production server system:\n\nMost Ubuntu Server developers do not recommend installing X on a\n  server. There are multiple reasons for not installing a GUI. \nSome reasons to not install a GUI include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You'll have more code subject to security vulnerabilities, more packages that need updating, and more server downtime.\n  \n*X11 and desktop packages are not supported for the full 5 year lifecycle of the LTS server release.\n  \n*Performance may suffer because resources (memory, hard disk space, CPU, etc.) will be consumed by the GUI.\n  \n*It is best practice to only install needed software on a production server.\n  \n*The GUI may include other network services that are inappropriate for a server.\n  \n*\n  \n*One of the goals of Ubuntu Desktop Edition is to make it easier for users to use Linux. When installing some desktop environments,\n  services that you may not specifically want will be installed. For\n  example avahi-daemon, which is used to help configure networking,\n  adds another open port and may introduce unwanted DNS conflicts with a\n  .local domain.\n  \n  \n  \n  So for the most secure server it is best to not install a GUI.\n\n\"ServerGUI\" by \"Contributors to the Ubuntu documentation wiki\", reproduced here as permitted by CC-BY-SA 3.0.\nContrary to somewhat common misconception, X11 being a server really has nothing to do with why running a GUI on a production server is considered to be non-ideal from a security perspective. X11 is virtually never configured by default to be accessible over a network anymore, on any operating system. No version of Ubuntu has ever had X11 run a network-accessible server in the default configuration. (To access X11 on Ubuntu via TCP, you have to forward it though SSH or manually reconfigure the server.)\nFurthermore, even if X11 did run a network-accessible server, this would not be a reason not to have it installed on a production server system. Anyone running a production server is presumably capable of configuring it for their needs and auditing it  to make sure undesirable services are not running. (If they cannot, that will pose a far greater threat to their security than would be created by having a GUI installed.) Even if X11 had to have a port listening on a physical network interface (which is not the case), the port could easily be blocked by reconfiguring the built-in netfilter using iptables (or a higher-level frontend like ufw).\nIn contrast, the problems listed above are not so easy to overcome by reconfiguration.\n\nA: Every running process is a security risk. Particularly those which listen on a network port (X11 does).\nGeneral good practise is not to run anything on a server that doesn't absolutely need to be there, and X11 certainly doesn't need to be on a server that you'll SSH into.\nI doubt the article you read was talking about a specific vulnerability in X11 (it would have been fixed if so, vulnerabilities don't tend to hang around unfixed for long), but rather just general good practise.\n\nA: This is because the X Window System poses a serious security risk if it is not properly secured. An X11 \"display\" is the X11 server running on your desktop, and includes the screen, keyboard and mouse. If your X11 display is insecure, it will allow a program running anywhere on the Internet to connect to it and the connection may be completely invisible to you. Once connected, that program has full access to your display, which means that it can:\n\n*\n\n*View and copy your screen's contents, using standard X11 utility\nprograms;\n\n*Monitor your keystrokes;\n\n*Remotely control any browser on your desktop and forge keystrokes as if you were typing them yourself (although not all X11 applications are susceptible to this).\n\nA thumb rule is NOT to use xhost + -- It completely disables your display's security.\nA good way is to forward X is through ssh.\n\nTaken from : http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/computing/security/xwindow/\n\nA: The real reason is so admins can think of themselves as super smart by running stuff from the command line. There is no security risk of running a GUI on Ubuntu server. \n", "Q: Dual Monitor with high resolution I got some trouble with my dual monitor setup.\nMy monitors:\nIiyama 22\" 1680x1050\nSamsung SyncMaster TA350 24\" 1920x1080\nMy graphics card is an AMD Radeon 5750 and I installed the additional AMD driver correctly.

So now, I bought a Samsung 24\" monitor, connected it via dsub and ubuntu says that the resolution is too high. So I changed the virtual screen resolution to 3600x1080 in xorg.conf but after a reboot I had to detach my new monitor - only the 22\" Iiyama works.\nHow can I get my Samsung (and my dual monitor setup) to work?\nThx for help! :)\n\nA: Did You try editing xorg.conf in such manner that You added the second monitor manually?\n(try this fr reference)\n", "Q: No page number in first page I am writing a document and it is required that the first page (title page) has no page number and the second page starts with page 2. I don't know how to remove the footed only in page 1 and leaving the footer in the rest of the pages as is. Can anyone maybe help? \nMany thanks\n\nA: I am assuming that you already know how to set page numbers to your document.\nRemoving page number on the first page and starting page number from the second page is even easier than the accepted answer. \nClick on Format menu and select Title page. \n\nYou will now be presented with a 'Title pages' dialog box. Under 'Page numbering' heading, select the option 'Reset Page Numbering after title pages'. You may choose the number of title pages that you don't want to have the page number. \n\n\nA: The previous answers are definitely the easiest way to fix your problem.  The options involving Title pages are relatively new.\nThe \"old\" way is more generic and will solve many other problems as well.\nOne of the greatest strengths of LibreOffice writer is its concept of styles.  Styles are sets of formatting options that can be applied to individual or multiple characters, paragraphs, lists, frames, or pages.  When you assign a style to one of these \"objects\", it applies the formatting from the style, but also remembers that the object is formatted in that style.\nSubsequently, if you change the definition of the style, every object that has that style may be updated - either manually or automatically, if auto update is selected for that style.  It's a great way to uniformly change everything that should look the same in your document at one time - like changing all subtitles to have a different font or point size.\nIn this case, you could define and apply a page style for the title page that has no page number.  You can also change anything else about this page without affecting the other pages.\nYou can open the styles dialog by pressing F11.\nStyles are useful for all sorts of other things like making left pages different from right pages and making all your body text a particular font and size without changing special text like headings.\nIf you haven't used styles before, it takes some getting used to, but it's well worth the effort.  There's a lot more to it as well.  Styles are very powerful.\nBruce Byfield writes clearly on the subject and on several other writer subjects.\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7203\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7488\nSolveig Haugland is also very clear on many writer topics.\nhttp://openoffice.blogs.com/\n\nA: If you set the offset to \"-1,\" the second page (the one after the title page) will show up as \"page 1\" in the page number field.\n\nA: First, make a copy of your document for safety purposes!\nPlease set so called 'Title pages':\nMenu format -> Insert title pages  *convert existing pages to title pages\n\nAnd while setting page numbers in footnote:\nMenu insert -> Field -> Others -> Document -> Page -> Page numbers -> Offset. \n\n\nSet it to requested value: 1\n\nA: Formatting the first page as \"First page\" using F11 > Page Style, then inserting a page counting field on the 2nd page footer and finally setting the offset to -1 also works.\n", "Q: Storing files on cloud I want to upload some files to the cloud and leave the there to see/use.\nI don't want them on my pc as they take up space (ie no syncing )\nIf I uncheck sync with local pc, it won't let me do anything to cloud folder.\nI am using Ubuntu One\nThanks\n\nA: If your pc is linked to Ubuntu 1 the files will keep in sync with your account, no way to change this (not on a per file / per folder base). \nYou could however unlink your pc and upload the files via U1 web interface. You can also use one the many free file hosters / sharers / cloud services around, this would allow you to continue using U1 from your pc.\nAnyhow, assuming the files have a certain size (and you intend to use them)  you will not have much fun with your cloud-exclusive copy.

The problem in my case was my network was not good. i replaced it and everything works like charm\n", "Q: What processes should be ioniced for a responsive desktop? My goal is to intelligently and permanently ionice the processes on my desktop for responsiveness under heavy disk and network load. By permanently, I mean that any changes made to the system will persist across reboots. I want to eliminate situations where I can't move a window because disk bandwidth is saturated by a process that isn't in anyway serving my GUI.\nThere are hundreds of processes running on my system. Which ones could be run with class idle and which ones with class real time?\nIs it a good idea to set the X and gnome-shell processes to class real time?\nHow about setting cupsd, avahi-daemon, gnome-screensaver, deluge, ntpd and backintime to class idle?\nHere's a list of the currently running processes on my system.\n\nA: I think you're going to have better results tuning your VM (virtual memory) and writeback tendencies (swappiness) than going the ionice route, though if you must.\nYou can use dpkg-divert to permanently move the interested binaries like /usr/bin/firefox -> /usr/bin/firefox.orig. Then you're free to create a shell script in it's place like this:\n\n#!/bin/sh\n# straight from the ionice manpage\nionice -c 2 -n 0 /usr/bin/firefox.orig $@\n\nPretty clear what the outcome is.\nYou could also go the cgroups route which is probably more cost effective in the long run, but you also open yourself up to a host of new performance based problems. Once you start metering resources you can easily starve out processes unintentionally, it'll do exactly what you tell it to do, even if you don't understand all the repercussion. \nIt looks like duplicity or deja-dup is running (rsync), which will of course suck up all your ioband width, some cpu too. Another option is to simply schedule it for when you're not in front of the computer, that's what I do. The best solution I've seen for io management is dm-ioband but it lives out of tree and has been under constant development for sometime.\nI wish I had a blanket solution for you but there's no such thing with performance engineering. Here's a good guide from IBM, but you'll notice it that it's mostly \"here's how you get started\" for each subsystem, there aren't many \"do this and be happy\" recipes as they don't exist, every system's needs is different when it comes to performance tuning.\nhttp://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4285.pdf \n", "Q: No wlan0 found with a Broadcom 4313 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to get Broadcom BCM 43XX Wireless card working \n\nI've installed Ubuntu 11.10 on an Asus 1015PN netbook with 2 gigabytes memory using WUBI.\nGot a Broadcom 4313 chipset (14e4:4727).\nI wanted to connect my netbook to my mobile using Joikuspot premium and I was able to scan and find the wireless AP but wasn't able to obtain an IP so I set a static IP and disabled ipv6 without any luck.\nThen after reading a post I installed the broadcom wireless source, common and the firmware (brcmwl-kernel-source) using synaptic.

I've tried to go to view (hidden / unhidden) files but it not works:(  \nWhat is the problem?\n\nA: It could be a question of permissions. Go on the windows partition and check if the folders are protected and who can see. You may add \"everyone\" to the list of those who can access the files. (File,Properties,Sharing/Security)\nYou may also try to try to check if you can access files in Ubuntu as root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2 \n\n*Type gksu nautilus\n\nA: If you're using Nautilus to view files/folders, click \"Edit\", \"Prefrences\" and then select \"Show hidden and backup files\" under the \"View\" tab.\nNautilus is like Vista's File explorer. The easiest path to it in Unity is to select the Home Folder on the Launcher.\n", "Q: How do I install Alfresco (Enterprise Content Management software) Give me some steps to install the Alfresco on Ubuntu 10.10.\nI am new to Ubuntu so please give me some guide to install the Alfesco on Ubuntu system\n\nA: A quick installation guide is available in the official Alfresco documentation. It's targeting the Enterprise edition, but if you are to install Community the only thing that changes is the binary file.\n\nA: After unzipping the archive, the easiest way is to simply run the installer:\n./alfresco.bin\n\nThis will guide you through the installation process, and is very easy to follow!\n\nA: *\n\n*Download the release you want.\n\n\nopen a terminal and Go into the Downloads folder..\ncd Downloads\n\nmake it executable:\nsudo chmod +x filename.bin\n\nthen run the installer\nsudo ./filename.bin\n\nfollow the instructions on the installer\n", "Q: Cannot SSH/SFTP to remote server without using another remote server I can access a server A with SSH, and from there I can access server B, but I can't access B directly.\nIs it possible to open a Nautilus folder in server B by clicking in Places â Connect to Server?\n\nA: Yes that is possible. \nI have the following setup which works, but there might be easier ones. \nIn the file ~/.ssh/config, add the following lines:\nControlMaster auto\nControlPath   /home/yourusername/.ssh/tmp/%h_%p_%r\nHost A\n  HostName hostname.of.server.a\n\nHost B\n  ProxyCommand ssh -e none A netcat -w 5 hostname.of.server.b 22\n\nYou have to replace yourusername, hostname.of.sever.a and hostname.of.server.b\nAfter that, you can (in Nautilus) go to Places->Connect to Server (its actually File->Connect to Server on my machine). And then enter B.\nThat should be all to see the server B.\n\nA: One thing to try is to add this to .ssh/config:\nHost B\n  ProxyCommand ssh A nc -q0 %h %p\n  ForwardAgent yes\n\nOnce this is in place, you should be able to ssh B directly, and SSH will know to \"bounce\" the connection through A first.\nWhen this is working, try Nautilus the way you describe and see if the proxying setup works for it as well.\n\nA: An update on the previous answers: using netcat to forward the connection on the intermediate host works differently than ssh'ing directly, and will fail when you want to e.g. connect to a VNC server that is set to only accept local connections through a jumphost tunnel. In order for the connection to work exactly like a direct one, use the -W option present in newer versions of the client:\nHost jumphost\nHostname hostname.of.jumphost\n\nHost target\nHostname hostname.of.target\nPort 30022\nProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p jumphost\n\n", "Q: gnome-tweak-tool doesn't start due to \"ImportError: No module named gi\" error I am using Ubuntu 11.10 with Gnome Shell and have a problem with gnome-tweak-tool.

After doing some search, it seems this webcam should just work out of the box. However, Cheese and Skype don't seem to work with it. With those programs loaded, the webcam appears in the list of video devices in their configurations, but the orange light indicator on the webcam does not turn on.

You can see that whenever you do something like apt-get --purge remove abc. On the original machine you would be notified that package xyz was installed as dependency of abc and that you may use apt-get autoremove to get rid of it.\nNow I am aware of deborphan and debfoster, but they're cumbersome to use given the (simple) task at hand.\nIt seems saving and restoring the selections as shown above is not sufficient to restore the subtle dependencies of installed packages.\nIs there a way to back up the complete set of metadata for package management and restore it then in its entirety?\n\nA: The selected answer to this question is incomplete and does not (or no longer) works.  The painful fix is to use a bash for-loop to parse the output *.lst files and feed them to apt install.  Bad choice, though, so will not be illustrated here.\nA better choice is to use apt-clone, as seen in this answer on the Unix & Linux Stackexchange.  This creates a small file (around 100K or less for my system).  Allegedly, it will clone the packages with little effort or pain.\nSo, in short, on the original machine:\napt-clone clone `uname -n`\n\nThen, on the machine to clone to, copy the clone file and run:\napt-clone restore original-machine-name.apt-clone.tar.gz\n\nI include this answer here since this page turned up in initial web searches, but the other answer did not.

I set it to the correct time, but it slows down and speeds up sporadically.\nCan I fix this? If not, why is it happening?\n\nA: The clock loosing time is most likely to be caused by a fault CMOS battery. You can work around it by running ntp.\nYou can do this easily via the clock. Click on the clock and choose the bottom option of \"Time & Date Settings...\"\nYou have to \"unlock to change these settings\" and enter your password.\nNear the bottom, where it says \"Set the time\", choose \"Automatically from the internet\".

I would like Conky to only show up on one viewport/desktop.\nI did use the Gnome feature to predefine viewports for specific window classes, but this feature does not work for Conky. Even moving it manually to another viewport does not work, because it jumps back to the first viewport, as it refreshes.\nSo... is it possible to configure Conky to define the viewport it is displayed on?\n\nA: Just follow these simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look through your conky setup for any references to own_window_hints.  If there is a reference to 'sticky', remove it as it will cause conky to draw your window on all workspaces (making this entire exercise a moot point)\n\n*Look through for references to own_window_type as well.  You want this set to 'normal', because it does not enable the 'sticky' from above.  For my money, I personally do not use own_window_type, instead preferring to set everything through own_window_hints for finer control of the own window settings.\n\n*Determine the size of each viewport.  This can be done with the wmctrl program, which you might need to install first.  The command to install it is:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nTo use it, type into a command window, wmctrl -d.  This will give you the overall size of your combined viewports (DG), the viewport location of your current workspace (VP), and a few other details like the dimensions of your current workspace.\n\n*Apply a gap_x and gap_y to match these dimensions for each workspace you want to move your conky window over to. For example, if wmctrl is giving you:\n\n0  * DG: 6720x1050  VP: 0,0  WA: 49,24 1631x1026  N/A\n\nthen you might want to start with gap_x of at least 1631 to start with to get onto the second workspace (in this example you have 4 workspaces of 1631x1026 set side by side in a horizontal arrangement.\nFrom there, obviously tinker away to get it precisely where you want it...and happy Conkying!\nSource\n\nA: A friendly redditor answered my question with the following trick:\nSet the gap_x and gap_y properties, so that conky is positioned on the wished viewport.

I recently started packaging up some of my software and publishing it on Launchpad. The installation and removal works fine, but upgrading the package from one version to the next version is problematic.\nThe problem is that there are some scripts that only need to run during the first installation of the package. These scripts populate the DB, create a user, etc. They are currently called in the package.postinst configure) section. However this results in them being called during an upgrade as well as shown in the diagram.\nIs there a way to include a maintainer script in a .deb package that only executes during the first installation of the package and not during an upgrade? Or what would be an elegant way to include some initial setup scripts in a .deb package?\n\nA: Check out this diagram from the Debian wiki about how the maintainer scripts are called:\n\nIf you follow down the left hand side (the âeverything goes okâ path) you'll see that the postinst script is called with the most-recently configured version.  This gives you a chance to distinguish between an upgrade and a fresh install - in the upgrade case, your postinst will be called like\npostinst configure 1.23-0ubuntu1\n\nwhere 1.23-0ubuntu1 is the previously installed version of your package, whereas for a fresh install it will be called like\npostinst configure\n\nThis also allows you to handle the case when you need to perform an action when upgrading from a particular version - you can check in the postinst for that version.\nThis makes it easy to check if the script is being done on an 'install' or an 'upgrade'. If $2 is null, then it's an install. so:\nif [ -z \"$2\" ]; then\n  do install stuff\nelse\n  do upgrade stuff\nfi\n\n\nA: You might be able to use a debian/preinst script in combination with postinst. \nIn the preinst script, check for a file your pkg definitely installs. If it is present, do nothing (because your package was previously installed), else, do your setup steps.  \nIf your setup steps require that your pkg is installed (in which case the above will not work because preinst runs before the installation), then your preinst script could write a file, for example: /tmp/setupmypkg. Your postinst script could simply test whether that file is present and if so do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*your initial setup steps\n\n*delete the /tmp/setupmypkg file\n\n\nA: With a debian/preinst file you can perform actions on install but not upgrade. \n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    install)\n        # do some magic\n        ;;\n\n    upgrade|abort-upgrade)\n        ;;\n\n    *)\n        echo \"postinst called with unknown argument \\`$1'\" >&2\n        exit 0\n        ;;\nesac\n\n#DEBHELPER#\n\nexit 0\n\nThough as the name implies, this is run before your package is installed. So you might not be able to do what you need here. Most packages simply test in the configure stage of the postinst if the user has been created already. Here's colord\n$ cat  /var/lib/dpkg/info/colord.postinst\n#!/bin/sh\n\nset -e\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    configure)\n\n# create colord group if it isn't already there\n    if ! getent group colord >/dev/null; then\n            addgroup --quiet --system colord\n    fi\n\n# create the scanner group if it isn't already there\n    if ! getent group scanner >/dev/null; then\n        addgroup --quiet --system scanner\n    fi\n\n# create colord user if it isn't already there\n    if ! getent passwd colord >/dev/null; then\n            adduser --system --ingroup colord --home /var/lib/colord colord \\\n        --gecos \"colord colour management daemon\"\n        # Add colord user to scanner group\n        adduser --quiet colord scanner\n    fi\n\n# ensure /var/lib/colord has appropriate permissions\n    chown -R colord:colord /var/lib/colord\n\n    ;;\nesac    \n\n\n\nexit 0\n\n\nA: I found that testing for $2 in your \"postinst configure\" script doesn't work properly if you have already installed your package once before, then uninstalled it (but without purging), then try to a reinstall again.  In this case, the postinst script still gets a version argument for the \"postinst configure\" step.\nHowever if you have installed the package before, then remove AND purge it, then reinstall again, the \"postinst configure\" script will NOT get a version argument in $2\n\nA: I don't think so but you can easily modify the preinst/postinst scripts to check if package is being installed for the first time and take standard action.\nMay be something like this,\nin preinst.\nif not is_package_istalled():\n    export MY_PACKAGE_FIRST_INSTALL\n\nin postinst,\nif MY_PACKAGE_FIRST_INSTALL:\n    Do First Install Setup \n\nEdit\nHmm, may be you can just check all this directly in postinst because I think dpkg would not set the status of the package as installed before executing postinst but I'm not sure. So the above could be come,\nin postinst,\nif not is_package_istalled():\n    Do First Install Setup \n\nWhere, is_package_installed can be you function to detect the installation status. May be something like 'dpkg --status packagename' \nOR \nWhy not just simply check if the changes you want to make are already there and only proceed if they are not.\n", "Q: Show current folder size in Nautilus I would like to know if it's possible to display the current folder size (in MB or GB) in Nautilus at the status bar.\nHere's a screenshot:\n\nas you can see, (in this case) I have 7 items, and I have 125.7 GB left.

If so, is there any way to get it work fine (visual effects are not important to me). What do I need to do?\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 and beyond play well with at least a Dual-Core processor. I recommend you trying some lighter editions, such as Xubuntu, or Lubuntu. Other derivatives from Ubuntu might be elementary OS, (beware as stable release Jupiter 0.1 is outdated, but I still use it on netbooks), or Linux Mint, which you may try the new LXDE version (faster but less eye candy). Good luck! ;)\nAlso, by hardware I may suppose you are talking of Windows XP, which in that case, minimum requirements are similar to the ones on Lubuntu. Ubuntu 11.10 is slightly heavier for your graphics in comparison to Windows 7 Home Premium.\n\nA: You might want to make sure you're using the Radeon Driver, that will provide you hardware acceleration for video and therefore a performance improvement. Hope it helps!\n\nA: The problem is Compiz - it's a resource hog.  Recent versions of Ubuntu [Desktop] use Compiz which requires a fairly recent CPU & GPU (within the last 3 years) to behave well, otherwise you'll notice severe choppiness and general \"slowness.\"  This was my experience with a Pentium 4 and an AGP Radeon.  With Ubuntu versions prior to 11.04 I had no problem with that older hardware, but as soon as I upgraded to a version using Compiz that older hardware just became unbearable.  I built a new computer with a core i7 and Radeon 7870 and now Ubuntu 12.04 is responsive and snappy.  Your Celeron and Radeon 9250 are probably not powerful enough to run all the Compiz eye-candy so you may want to try using a version/distro of Linux that doesn't depend on Compiz, otherwise consider upgrading your hardware.\n", "Q: Get multiple screens working in 11.10 : The selected configuration for displays could not be applied Seriously, sometimes I hate Ubuntu.\nI try to get my secondary screen working, but when I enable it I get this error:\nThe selected configuration for displays could not be applied\nrequired virtual size does not fit available size: requested=(3280, 1050), minimum=(320, 200), maximum=(1680, 1680)\nAnd I know that this question has been asked before, but I still haven't my screen working.\nThe weird thing is that my secundary screen works till I log in. Before logging in it works fine. But after logging in my screen becomes black.\nSo I looked around for an answer and I've tried the following things.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo amdcccle and tried some setting according to multiple displays\n\n*replaced /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n*sudo aticonfig --initial\n\n*changed /etc/X11/xorg.conf and changed the 'Subsection display' part.\n\n\nOnly that last method works for me, but only one time. After a reboot this method didn't work out anymore.\nDoes someone knows an ultimate way to fix this? It really frustrates me.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You will be pleased to hear that 12.04 will have much better support for multiscreens. Using it right now. Piece of cake.\nAnyway, the error you get is probably an xrandr error complaining that your virtual display is too small.\nIf xrandr complains about the desktop not being large enough, put a Virtual info in your xorg.conf file, such as:\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier \"amdcccle-Screen[1]-0\"\nDevice     \"amdcccle-Device[1]-0\"\nDefaultDepth     24\nSubSection \"Display\"\n    Viewport   0 0\n    Virtual   3360 1920\nDepth     24\nEndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nOnly the SubSection \"Display\" with the Virtual line should be added, the rest is specific for my setup. \n3360 is the height, 1920 is width. Just make sure that your virtual width and height is not less than your two resolutions added together. So, simply add both widths of both screens and use that number as virtual width. Virtual height is simply the largest height of one of your two monitors. In your case, it seems to be 3280 and 1050.\namdcccle sometimes adjusts this automatically, but not always it seems.\nRestart your computer for the new xorg.conf to take effect. \nGood luck!\n\nA: I receive the same message \"The selected configuration for displays could not be applied\"  in 12.04.

There are multiple accounts that fall into three general groups: Admin, Internet and Security.\n\n\n*\n\n*Admin is obviously has the authority to do whatever.\n\n*Internet account is for using the Internet.\n\n\nThe other accounts are Security accounts.  Under no circumstances is any networking Internet, printer, Bluetooth, WiFi devices, etc, allowed.\nWhat I'd like to do is remove the network drivers from the kernel, but that would disable the accounts that need Internet. \nWhat are the lowest level way(s) to disable Internet for these security accounts?  I'm looking for impossible to connect solutions.\n\nA: Bruno's solution is good: I think probably the best self-contained solution. \nAnother option you can think about is to set up a firewall/proxy on a separate machine, as the gateway to the internet, which only allows connections out that provide per-user authentication.  You could use use both together for extra protection.\n\nA: You can do that with iptables (ip6tables).\nUntil reboot\nOn a terminal add the rule to iptables\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p all -m owner --uid-owner username -j DROP\nsudo ip6tables -A OUTPUT -p all -m owner --uid-owner username -j DROP\n\nwhere username is the user that you want to disable the Internet connection. Save the file and exit.\nThis will add a rule to iptables (ip6tables) saying that any outgoing packages created by the specified user will be automatically dropped by it.\nIf you want to do the same for a complete group I suggest that instead of --uid username you use --gid-owner groupname, that will have the same effect for a complete user group.\nSo, for example, to prevent the group security from accessing the Internet the command would look something like this\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p all -m owner --gid-owner security -j DROP\nsudo ip6tables -A OUTPUT -p all -m owner --gid-owner security -j DROP\n\nPermanent\nTo make the rule permanent you can create a script in /etc/network/if-up.d/, add the necessary lines to it and make it executable.\nAs an option use iptables-save (ip6tables-save) to save your current rules and restore them on boot.\nSave the current iptables rules\nsudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables_rules\nsudo ip6tables-save > /etc/ip6tables_rules\n\nOpen /etc/rc.local with your favorite text editor and at the end of the file add\n/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/iptables_rules\n/sbin/ip6tables-restore < /etc/ip6tables_rules\n\nThat will restore the saved rules on each boot. Be careful in noticing that users for which you blocked only ipv4 connections will still be able to connect to the internet.\nFor more informations and several more iptables options consult its manpage.\n\nA: If firewalld is part of your setup, you can block network access for a specific user using a direct rule, es:\n/etc/firewalld/direct.xml\nâ¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾â¾\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<direct>\n  <chain ipv=\"ipv4\" \n         table=\"filter\" \n         chain=\"restrict_user_ipv4\"/>\n  <rule ipv=\"ipv4\" \n        table=\"filter\" \n        chain=\"OUTPUT\" \n        priority=\"1\">-m owner --uid-owner user -j restrict_user_ipv4</rule>\n  <rule ipv=\"ipv4\" \n        table=\"filter\" \n        chain=\"restrict_user_ipv4\" \n        priority=\"3\">-j DROP</rule>\n  <chain ipv=\"ipv6\" \n         table=\"filter\" \n         chain=\"restrict_user_ipv6\"/>\n  <rule ipv=\"ipv6\" \n        table=\"filter\" \n        chain=\"OUTPUT\" \n        priority=\"1\">-m owner --uid-owner user -j restrict_user_ipv6</rule>\n  <rule ipv=\"ipv6\" \n        table=\"filter\" \n        chain=\"restrict_user_ipv6\" \n        priority=\"3\">-j DROP</rule>\n</direct>\n\nDon't forget to reload with\n# firewall-cmd --reload\n\nReferences\n\n*\n\n*Block Outgoing Network Access For a Single User Using Firewalld - Red Hat Customer Portal\n", "Q: Problems after installing Ubuntu 11.10 I'm having trouble with Ubuntu 11.10.

Thanks to @n33rma for the edit suggestion.\n\nA: Here is a script that I keep on all my machines for finding disk hogs:\n$ cat ~/bin/hog\n#! /usr/bin/env bash\n#\n# -*- mode: shell-script -*-\n\ncase $# in\n(0) dir='.';;\n(1) dir=$1;;\n(*) echo \"usage: hog <dir>\"\n  exit 1;;\nesac\n\ndu -s --one-file-system $dir/* $dir/.[A-Za-z0-9]* | sort -rn | head\n\nAlso, on my machine, I have my home directory mounted with the noatime option, so I modified the above to:\nfind ~/.cache -depth -type f -mtime +365 -delete\n\nwhich keys off modification time.\nYou also might want to put this in your crontab, with crontab -e and add the lines:\n# Clean out ~/.cache\n13 3 * * 0 chronic find ~/.cache -depth -type f -mtime +365 -delete\n\n\nA: It is generally safe to delete it. You might want to close all graphical applications (e.g. banshee, rhythmbox, vlc, software-center, ..) to prevent any confusion of the programs accessing the cache (where did my file go all of a sudden!?).\nIt can easily have a size of 100+ MB, so if you want to free up disk space, do it.\nAs already pointed out by BretD and Dylan McCall, the type of files are partial downloads, browser cache, media files like icons, etc, used to speed up future access to the same files.\nAnother thing to keep in mind: removing an application does not necessarily delete the relevant ~/.cache/removed_prog folder; in this case those files just take space and are not used. Those can definitely be deleted.\n\nA: I would recommend not deleting it. I am not a Linux expert (though I hope to be!) and don't know the specifics of the file system structure, but you can examine what exactly is in the folder by going into your home folder and hitting ctrl+h to show hidden folders. You can then go in the .cache folder and see what's in there. \nJust from a quick peek on my system I know that banshee stores album art in the cache folder (don't know why exactly), chrome has data in the cache folder, a lot of programs keep logs in the .cache folder, and other stuff. \nI am not sure if these files are all just there temporarily for speed increase purposes (like browser cache) or if this \"cache\" contains files for some other purpose (as the speed increase of browser cache is to counteract excessive use of bandwidth by re-accessing files on a server, whereas there should be no discernible difference in r/w times for a different file location on the hard disk). \nI hope someone knows more about this than I do and can give you a better response. \n\nA: To answer the question, IMO you can delete all of .cache with no long term detrimental effects.\nIf your .cache is growing large, it might be better to look at the contents and determine what application is making it large and re-configure a bad acting application (rather than simply deleting .cache when it grows too large).\nAnother directory that can take up a lot of space (and/or save an embarrassing bit of evidence) is the .thumbs directory. Many files in .thumbs seem to be duplicates.\nTo clean (just take care with the -rf flag and other directories ;)\nrm -rf ~/.thumbs/*\n\nWhen you are new to Ubuntu/Linux it is hard to know what you can and can not delete in your home directory. For the most part you can delete most anything in your home directory, programs or applications that require .cache (or other dot files such as .local) will re-create them.\nMost of the time, at worst, you will lose custom configurations, but no real harm to the system.\nI would not advise you start a habit of deleting things you do not understand in your home directory, back it up or use a test account. If in doubt, the safe thing would be to make a back up or move the file.\nmv .cache .cache_backup\n\nYou can then restore from backup if needed.\nDefinitely do NOT start deleting  things you do not understand outside of your home directory.\n\nA: deleting .cache will delete most configuration settings to web applications. First to notice are the web browsers and mail clients. \nSame applies for folder .mozilla. \nFor example it will remove all accounts from Thunderbird and you have to re create them again. Regarding to web browsers it will delete the history and some of the content settings\nOther than that there is no trouble of deleting these files. \n", "Q: view ubuntu one files from another computer I have set up an account and uploaded folders form my main machine.

Each computer would have its own dedicated ethernet cable connecting it to the server.\n\nA: I'm not sure I understand entirely what you're asking for, but I'll see if I can answer, by making an assumption about what you are asking.  Feel free to inform me if I am incorrect.\nYou want to connect all the systems directly to the server without using the Internet to interlink them, right?  If so...\nThe easiest method is to buy a router that doesnt need much initial configuration, and then hook all the systems into the router including the server.  Then, you have your own internal LAN network which will allow all the systems to communicate with each other.  This method is easiest, and does not require extensive reconfiguration of your server box to act as a router/gateway/DHCP server.  This does, however, require you to go out and purchase a router.\nThe cheapest, but much more tricky, time-consuming, and extremely overkill for the standard user method would be to set up the Server as a gateway box and install/configure a DHCP daemon to assign IPs to the individual computers, and to give the server box its own 10.10.x.x IP address for the other systems to access it.\n", "Q: How to resolve compiler to compile c++ program?

Problem: I occasionally have network issues with my Ubuntu VPS. I cannot SSH to the box, I cannot ping the box by IP address. I can access the box via host Serial terminal. When I access the box via serial, I can't ping out anywhere (far as I can tell), even when pinging by IP address.  After some amount of time the network comes back, sometimes without my intervention. Sometimes it comes back when I am fiddling around. But it is hard to tell why. (Edit: It is very consistently out for 1 hour)\nQuestions: How can I proceed in troubleshooting this issue? What things can I do in order to rule out configuration/software problems in my control so that I can feel more comfortable bringing up the issue to my VPS host?\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bring eth0 down and up\n\n*Disable firewall temporarily\n\n*Checked VPS host advisories for network issues - haven't seen any\n\n*Reboot the server via Web console\n\n*Note: None of these have worked for me\n\n\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS\n\n*Hosted with Xen virtualization\n\n*Have root access (SSH) to perform my own upgrades, installs, etc.\n\n*I have the VPS setup as a VPN server so that I can connect to it \"Road Warrior\" style and forward all my traffic through the VPS first. So that is the junk with 10.8.X.X\n\n*All traffic including DNS lookups are forwarded through the VPS\n\n*Use uncomplicated firewall (ufw) with some basic rules\n\n*Also acts as a server for some services including Mumble and web server\n\n*I setup a script on the VPS as a cron job to ping some common internet entities by IP address every 5 minutes. If there is failure in the ping, then it logs it to a file. Simple enough. Consistently the network outage lasts for an hour. It does not always happen at the same time of day. On almost all of the occurrences, the network is down for an hour and then it \"magically\" comes back.\n\n*Memory usage on my VPS is typically very high. Usually I am maxed out and using some swap. The memory hog is java, if that detail helps.\n\n*My provider has been very unhelpful. It has ranged from \"we are sorry, we had an unfortunate issue\" to \"there is no problem now\". This is frustrating to me because typically I make a ticket when there is a problem, but the problem is gone by the time the ticket is addressed. The most recent communication has been that they suggest reformatting my VPS and starting over, which i am not keen about.\n\n*Consistently network outages start on the hour (within 5-10 minutes). That is, network outages do not start around XX:30, XX:45, etc.\n\n\nnetstat -rn \n\n    Kernel IP routing table  \n    Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface  \n    10.8.0.2        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH        0 0          0 tun0  \n    XX.57.166.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.128 U         0 0          0 eth0  \n    192.168.50.0    10.8.0.2        255.255.255.0   UG        0 0          0 tun0  \n    10.8.0.0        10.8.0.2        255.255.255.0   UG        0 0          0 tun0  \n    0.0.0.0         XX.57.166.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0  \n\nip route list\n\n    10.8.0.2 dev tun0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.8.0.1  \n    XX.57.166.0/25 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src XX.57.166.59  \n    192.168.50.0/24 via 10.8.0.2 dev tun0  \n    10.8.0.0/24 via 10.8.0.2 dev tun0  \n    default via XX.57.166.1 dev eth0  metric 100\n\ncat /etc/network/interfaces\n\n    auto eth0  \n    iface eth0 inet static  \n        address XX.57.166.59  \n        gateway XX.57.166.1  \n        netmask 255.255.255.128  \n    auto lo  \n    iface lo inet loopback\n\n\nA: Firstly if you believe this is a vendor issue that they're not addressing, I'd strongly consider migrating away. I gave VPS.net the benefit of the doubt when their SAN kept crashing (taking down all the VPSes in the process) but after a few months of \"We've fixed this for good\" and it still crashing, I had to vote with my wallet.\nIt's surprisingly easy to start a VPS company (you really only need a bit of datacenter space and some servers) so they're not all equal in technical ability even before you get to customer service.\nBut in terms of getting to the bottom of the problem, I'd first look at stopping things ending up in swap. Leave swap on but do whatever you have to do so you're not pushing things that far. Rein in the Java application or add more RAM. And see what happens. If this is very regular, you shouldn't have to wait long (or pay much) to see a result.\nSame with CPU. If you have things running at 100% for extended periods, you want to make sure they're not interfering with other applications. The most simple way to work this can be done by setting the nice value of whatever applications are rampant to something positive. A nice value of something like +10 should let the system get full priority of the resources before your applications. Sidebar: Nice values basically mean the're more polite when it comes to CPU scheduling. Something with a low (eg -20) nice value means they'll get prioritised over all other things with higher nice values.\nIf you can, expand your testing to other local network items. If they provide a DNS resolver (as a lot of server companies do), ping that constantly (well, a few times a minute) and log the results. If you can still access that during periods of downtime, it's less likely that it's your fault.\nAnd as I say, if this isn't your fault, move. If you spend any more time trying to fix this, you're outweighing any conceivable benefit of staying with these people. I personally have a very good and long experience with Linode but there are lots of good companies out there.\n", "Q: 11.10 very slow with Radeon HD 4290 onboard I just changed to Ubuntu 11.10 and I have had a painful experience trying to configure the onboard VGA.

When I open more than one window then it became more slow, Xara XL and Gimp get laggy after I do some work with them (the more filters I apply, the more slow the O.S. gets).\nWell, I tried the driver that came with the install, the proprietary driver from additional drivers, the last version of Catalyst from AMD web site (the driver installs, but when I try to use Catalyst it says there iÅ no driver installed), I unmarked VSync in CCSM, and nothing changed.

Suppose I have an alias in the bash shell. Is there a simple command to print out what command the alias will run?\n\nA: I really like Ctrl+Alt+E as I learned from this answer.

According to one of the comments in that page, you have to install libraries using this command:\nwinetricks vcrun6 wmp9 quartz devenum d3dx9_36\n\nAfter that, you should be able to run the game. Also, those instructions should work for wine 1.3.5 (or later). During game play, the report says you should skip videos.\nHTH.\n\nA: I would use playonlinux. It is essentially wine but has custom scripts that fix common faults with specific applications. Fable gets 4.5/5 stars too so that looks pretty good.\nhttp://www.playonlinux.com/repository/?script=15\n", "Q: Where can I download the drivers for a Canon MP 420 Series?

All of my flash storage devices have the same problem, in 11.04 Ubuntu it looks like I can delete from, save to, even format the devices, but as soon as I unmount them and then look at them in another system or put them back on the Ubuntu system then the old files reappear and the new ones are nowhere to be found. \nThis includes using Disk Utility to format the drives. (???) \nAnybody have a clue what's wrong with my install? The optical drive (DVD+R) is working fine. \nThis is all quite entertaining, but I need to be able to use my sdcards. \n\nA: This is a caching issue with the kernel's file system driver. I've seen issues like this crop up before and it's almost certainly that.

I've successfully installed all using the \"apt-get install\" method. My problem is I want to update PHP 5.3.2 to PHP 5.3.10. It is possible to do that? TIA!\n\nA: jrsalunga, you can try pulling in the 5.3.10 packages from precise (just updated last week), though it may not compile without modification:\napt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools\npull-lp-source php5 precise\ndpkg-source -x php5_5.3.10-*.dsc\napt-get build-dep php5\ncd php5-5.3.10\ndebuild binary\n\nThis will take a long time, and may fail because of all of the changes between 10.04 and 12.04. However, if it succeeds, the .debs produced should be fully installable on 10.04.\n\nA: Thanks to Dig for the info on the 3rd party PPA for PHP 5.3.10.  I was able to upgrade my 10.04 install using those instructions.\nOne hiccup during the upgrade was that I did not have apt-add-repository available on my system.  It turns out this is provided by the package python-software-properties.\nFor anyone with the same issue, install it with:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\n\nYou should then have apt-add-repository available on your system.\n\nA: For anyone who wants to upgrade Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to PHP 5.3.10, this is how I have done it:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge php*  \nsudo apt-get autoremove  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:l-mierzwa/lucid-php5\nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cli php5-cgi php5-mysql php5-gd  \nsudo service apache2 restart  \nsudo pecl uninstall apc  \nsudo pecl install apc  \n\nIt looks a bit drastic using sudo apt-get remove --purge php* but Ubuntu does proceed to list a load of files that get filtered but then ignored and I have successfully upgraded 3 times so far.\nGood Luck and thanks to Brian Mercer for his php5 PPA.\n[Update 2014-11-05]\nFrom OndÅej SurÃ½'s launchpad site:\n\n\n*\n\n*PHP 5.4 : ppa:ondrej/php5-oldstable\n\n*PHP 5.5 : ppa:ondrej/php5 \n\n*PHP 5.6 : ppa:ondrej/php5-5.6\n\n\nA: Mostly software/applications are get updated automatically with regular updates in Ubuntu (and in other GNULinux distribution) if the latest version is available in repository. \nPHP has released 5.3.10 version as stable but I'm afraid it is not available on Ubuntu's repository yet. And I don't think they would make available for 10.04. Because if you check here (under \"Packages by distribution->Ubuntu\") the PHP's availability for each version of Ubuntu, you can find even latest version of PHP available for Ubuntu 12.04 (which is not released not yet) is 5.3.8. And for 10.04 it is 5.3.2. May be thats why it is not getting updated when you do regular update.\nNow, even if you update Ubuntu to the latest stable version, which is 11.10, you are not going to get PHP 5.3.10 but 5.3.6.\nMay be you should wait until they update their repository. Or if you cannot wait then download it from it's website and compile & install it yourself, if you know how to do it.\n:)\n", "Q: How to restart Gnome Shell after a crash short of killing X? How can I restart Gnome Shell after a crash? Alt+F2 and restart won't work as the prompt crashed with the shell. Since windows focus is gone along with the shell as well, I can't type gnome-shell --replace in a terminal, either. The Ctr+Alt+F1 command line can't open the X display. So I'm left with killing X, thus loosing all open applications. Is there a keyboard shortcut for restarting Gnome Shell?\n\nA: I will assume you are running 3.2 Currently due to the obvious bugs the best thing to do is 1 of the following.\nThe first thing to do is create a seperate profile in whatever terminal you have as default, or whichever it would be if you opened a terminal from your file browsers right click menu. Try to name this profile something you will notice like Restart Shell. In this new profile you want to set it to 'Run a custom command instead of my shell', you would find this in Gnome Terminal under Edit>Profile Preferences>Title and Command. Check the box and insert      \ngnome-shell --replace\n\nNext do one of the follwing when you run into a crash. Always remember to keep the terminal running once it's open.:\na) Keep a browser open. Example, Firefox is open, no Title Bars and you can't restart, close anything that might be blocking the focus of Firefox. In FF click Tools>Downloads and find a recent download, right click on it and click Open Containing Folder. Now right click and Open in Terminal. It will now either open your default profile or you will right click and select the Restart Shell profile and open a new tab, thus automatically starting a new shell. You must now keep the terminal open.\nb) always keep a terminal open. Then when you crash, you just select the alternate profile, and open a new tab which should launch that profile and the command to start a new shell.\nc) In empathy and pidgin, perhaps other IM clients as well, type file:/// and hit enter. This will allow you to click the link and should open your file browser(Nautilus). If not, try right clicking on it and selecting the appropriate action. From the browser you open the terminal by right clicking.\nAll of these options can come in handy and help prevent a lot of frustration. One thing to remember is sometimes to get to the window you need, i.e Firefox, since everything might be blocking focus; File>Exit, should normally do the trick.\n\nA: I found that all the other ways did not work for me (i.e. those based around gnome-shell --replace).\nFirst, switch to tty1 with ctrl+alt+1, then log in. Use top or htop (or pkill?) to kill gnome-shell (you will probably need to kill with sigkill 9). (You might need to run DISPLAY=:0 gnome-shell, although I usually don't.)\nSwitch back to the GUI with ctrl+alt+7. (Normally gnome-shell will automatically restart for me.)\n\nA: Have you tried\nDISPLAY=:0 gnome-shell --replace\n\nfrom a console prompt (see also this answer)?\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Ctr+Alt+F1\n\n*Log in\n\n*Execute DISPLAY=:0 gnome-shell --replace\n\n*Hit Ctr+Alt+F7\n\nA: There is not a keyboard shortcut for restarting Gnome Shell.\nBut you can assign a shortcut for gnome-shell --replace command.\nThis will be very useful, but sometimes killing X is the only solution about Shell crash.\n\nA: If you have an ssh server installed this can also be done over an ssh connection, just log in and run\nDISPLAY=:0 gnome-shell --replace\n\nYou might have to select another value for the display, for example DISPLAY=:1\nDISPLAY=:1 gnome-shell --replace\n\nOne thing to keep in mind now is that the process is now attached to the current terminal, so you might want to experiment with nohup and detach with &. But if you just want to salvage a bad situation it might be ok to be connected so you can save and shutdown the gnome session or reboot in a controlled manner.\n", "Q: Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint won't save or open files I'm a web developer, but new to linux.

I do not want to get suggestions on how to get to the classic session, I want to know how to uninstall the GTK3 stack from 11.10 and replace it with GTK2\nI know Gnome is no longer maitaining Gnome2/GTK2 so, I know the concerns.. backward incompatability e.t.c\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 is built on the premise of the GTK+3 software libraries.  Therefore, removing GTK+3 will effectively mean no \"ubuntu\".  What you will be left with is a newer kernel and a few additional slightly upgraded packages.\nIf you are not interested in backward compatibility etc, then it would be simpler to start from a GTK+2/gnome2 based distro such as Natty and upgrade from that.\nThus, at a minimum - look to installing the 11.10 kernel - either from the mainline or compiling your own.\nIf the tenor of your question is simply that you don't like the gnome-classic option then personally I would look at similar gnome-2 workflow options such as Cinnamon or excellent panel based options such as LXDE/Lubuntu or XFCE/Xubuntu.\nI would also mention MATE that delivers much of the GTK+2 based libraries onto on Ubuntu.  If you take this option, you can use questions like how to remove unity to remove the GUI shell without touching the fundamental core of ubuntu.\n\nA: I don't believe it is possible to completely uninstall Gnome 3 on 11.10 but you can install the Gnome 'Classic' session from the repositories which when selected at login will give you a close match to the Gnome 2 DE\nType the following in a terminal sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback then log out and select the Gnome Classic session at the log in manager.\nThere is a good guide to further customizing the appearance of it here\n\nA: You can install MATE, a GNOME 2 fork, and uninstall Unity.\nInstall MATE\nRemove Unity\n", "Q: Wireless problems, doesnt seem to have any easy fix I was on my laptop dell latitude d630(wireless was working just fine) then out of no where it stopped working but if use a wireless usb adapter i can reconnect i have tried sudo get-apt install firmware-b43-installer and i tried purging the bwml(something), i have rebooted removed the adapter and im still not able to connect to the wireless, i can see all the available networks but it wont let me connect to any, i have passwords for all of them, but when it times out it prompts me to enter the wireless password again and then repeats the same problem. \n\nA: I, too, have A Dell Latitude D630, running Ubuntu 11.10, and connect to my local Access Point (WPA2-PSK) with ease, and have connected to an Open (no security) AP.  \nClick on the Wireless icon in the top row of the screen, make sure that Enable Networking and \"Enable Wireless\" are checked; then  select \"Edit Connections\".

Therefore I sync the folder ~/.local/share/gnote to Ubuntu One. But I don't know how to tell Gnote on the other PC to utilize this synced folder.\n\nA: If you are already syncing a folder on Computer 1 with Ubuntu One, you can easily add that folder on Computer 2 with the Ubuntu One app.  \nOpen it and click on the 'Cloud Folders' button. You should see the ~/.local/share/gnote folder from your question there.  \nMake sure you are seeing all the folders by clicking the small black triangle next to 'My Folders' to expand the list.  \n \nThis assumes you have already added it on Computer 1, and that at least one sync has occurred.

So I tried just sda and it worked. Well, it seems that it worked.\nThen I rebooted and got the grub recovery-line. The only possible command, that I knew was ls and it showed something like: \n(hd0) (hd0,msdos3) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1)\n\nAnd when I tried to ls hd0, it showed unknown filesystem and ls hd0,msdos1-3 showed wrong filename.\nSo I started Ubuntu from my usb-drive again and I just wanted to get sure that my partitions are still ok and typed in sudo blkid.\nThis is the result:\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"PENDRIVE\" UUID=\"1A0C-1658\" TYPE=\"vfat\"\n/dev/sdb1: LABEL=\"OS\" UUID=\"9A34A62D34A60C77\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n/dev/sdb2: LABEL=\"data\" UUID=\"8A9AAA5C9AAA4513\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\nSo my usb-drive is now sda instead of sdb and my hdd-partitions are sdb instead of sda.\nMaybe I'm too tired and see ghosts, but what did I wrong?\n\nA: Yes, it does look like a typical MBR error message.  I ended up with a similar situation, although I was able to reinstall grub from a liveCD and then boot into Ubuntu well enough.  (I don't know if your boot repair program reinstalls grub; if not, I'll post the instructions below.  I can't take credit for them, but I don't know any longer where I got them.) I was never able to get Windows working again and in the end I had to remove it; I hope your situation can come out better.  But, once I could boot into Ubuntu, at least, I was able to access my Windows partition and remove everything of value from it before I deleted the partition.\n\nThis is a quick and simple method of restoring a broken system's GRUB 2 files. The terminal is used for entering commands and the user must know the device name/partition of the installed system (sda1, sdb5, etc). The problem partition is located and mounted from the LiveCD. The files are then copied from the LiveCD libraries to the proper locations and MBR. It requires the least steps and fewer command line entries than the following methods. If for example Windows is on sda1 and Ubuntu is on sda5, and Windows has overwritten the MBR, then the target for grub installation will be /dev/sda5, and the MBR in the boot sector of sda will be re written for grub.\nThis operation will write to the MBR and restore the modules and core.img to /boot/grub. It will not replace or restore grub.cfg or fix corrupted files.\nBoot the LiveCD Desktop.\n\nOpen a terminal by selecting Applications, Accessories, Terminal from the menu bar.\n\nDetermine the partition with the Ubuntu installation. The fdisk option \"-l\" is a lowercase \"L\".\n\n    sudo fdisk -l\n\n    If the user isn't sure of the partition, look for one of the appropriate size or formatting.\n\n    Running sudo blkid may provide more information to help locate the proper partition, especially if the partitions are labeled. The device/drive is designated by sdX, with X being the device designation. sda is the first device, sdb is the second, etc. For most users the MBR will be installed to sda, the first drive on their system. The partition is designated by the Y. The first partition is 1, the second is 2. Note the devices and partitions are counted differently. \nMount the partition containing the Ubuntu installation.\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nExample: sudo mount /dev/sda1 Note: If the user has a separate /boot partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/boot Note: If the user has a separate /home partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/home. Encrypted home partitions should work.\n\nRun the grub-install command as described below. This will reinstall the GRUB 2 files on the mounted partition to the proper location and to the MBR of the designated device.\n\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX\n\nExample: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda \n\nIn Grub 1.99, introduced with Ubuntu 11.04, Natty Narwhal, a new switch is available which more clearly defines where the grub folder is placed. The command above will still work with Grub 1.99, but the following command is preferred by the developers. The target directory in the command is the command into which the grub folder will be installed. By default, and without the switch, the location is /boot/grub. In these instructions, since the Ubuntu partition is mounted on /mnt, the target would be /mnt/boot/grub.\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX\n\nExample: sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/ /dev/sda\n\nReboot\n\nRefresh the GRUB 2 menu with sudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Broadcom brcm80211 installation from source Hello need help to get my wifi chipset working.I have brcmsmac driver and i would like to have brcm80211 chipset up and running.

There is no support for ad-hoc, access point and bridges yet. So a better option is use a \"wl0\" driver which supports managed and ad-hoc modes plus bridges and works much better.

The VPN is on OpenVPN. \nWhat is the best way to do this?\n\nA: I assume you now have it configured with network manager under X.\nBut you can also configure a client-vpn-connecton in a config file and put it in /etc/openvpn/. Openvpn should start as a service when booting your client machine and start all configurations found.\nFrom the quickstart guide on openvpn.net:\n\nThe initscript will scan for .conf configuration files in /etc/openvpn, and if found, > will start up a separate OpenVPN daemon for each file.\n\nCheck out: openvpn Client Example Config and Ubuntu Communitu Documentation - OpenVPN more information.\n", "Q: Does anyone have any idea if/when Ubuntu is going to switch the default ruby install from 1.8 train to the 1.9 train?

It's to maintain backwards-comparability, at least until 1.8.7 is end of lifed in June 2012 (for normal bugfixes) and then in June 2013 when security fixes stop (so at time of updating, it is already EOLed). source and source2\n\n*You can install ruby 1.9.2 via the ruby1.9.1 package, so its not really that big of a deal - you can also setup a alias so /usr/bin/ruby will run /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1.

Personal preference.\nuse THIS GUIDE and you shouldn't have any issues.\n\n\nA: With four or less partitions there should not be a problem making them all primary.\nHave you considered also making a swap partition?\n\nA: You can only have 4 primary partitions, so if you want more then 4 partitions you will have to use extended/logical partitions. Other then that limit (4 primary partitions) it does not matter.\n\nA: As already posted, with an MSDOS partition table (the default) you can have up to four primary partitions, so just make every partition a primary partition.\nI'm not sure why you'd want /usr/ on a separate partition. /usr/ contains \"userspace program files\" - it's the equivalent of C:\\Program Files\\ on a Windows machine.\nI think what you're trying to do is put your personal files (Windows C:\\Users\\ or C:\\Documents and Settings\\) on a separate partition. This corresponds to /home/ in Linux.\nAnd by \"physical memory\" I think you mean a swap partition. A swap partition on a USB hard disk is going to be doggedly slow, but if you have enough RAM you won't be hitting swap too much (so no big deal.)\n", "Q: Connection problems between Access Point and Ubuntu I have an access point already configured (with another AP and it's 3 IP cameras) and I can  get in with a WinXP laptop (by AP's IP address) who is wired connected, directly to the AP.\nNow, I want to mount an Ubuntu computer to stay connected as my laptop is.

The following page also describes this problem and both a link to a patch that should fix the problem, and a link to a page that tells how to apply that patch: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1865113 \nHowever, that only fixes the white background problem. To get rid of the x cursor and be able to interact with the laptop display, you will need to either,\n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install, and use Gnome-Classic. I cannot remember what I did to download and install Gnome-Classic, but I did some searching and I think the following command (run from the terminal) might be what does it: sudo apt-get install gnome-panel. To use Gnome-Classic, simply click on the gear icon (located near the password prompt) in the login screen and choose it from the list (and then login).\nThis should allow you to interact with both displays. However, on my computer, when using separate x screens, it removed the toolbar in the first display (not really a problem if you do not mind using the terminal) and, if my first right-click was in the second display, it not only failed, but prevented me from  accomplishing further right-clicks in either display.\n\n*Download and install Xfce: sudo apt-get install xfce4. You should then be able to use it by selecting it from the login screen (by clicking on the gear by the password prompt). If it's not in the list, though, then check the answer given to me in the first link I posted.\nThis is (in my opinion) the better option, as (for me) it ran without error (as far as I could see). Unless you do not wish to use a different desktop manager, then the first option is usable (however, buggy).\n\n", "Q: How to give back to the OSS community without coding? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I contribute to Ubuntu? \n\nI have been using Open Source software for a few months and loving it.

I've tried some very unsophisticated ideas (e.g., an alias or function in my .bashrc, a simple shell script), but they all open the file once, then open another instance after i close the first open file).\nI know it's not a big deal to simply type an aliased command four (say) times, but it must be dead easy to write a command that would call, e.g.,\nmupdf /path/to/file/file.pdf\n\nfour times so the file is opened four times all at once..?\n\nA: It sounds like that your approach is using sequential invokation of the commands. You need to start the programs in the background. In bash (use your own program instead of the fictional 'openpdf'):\n$ openpdf something.pdf &\n[1] 1234\n$\n\nThe & symbol tells bash to launch the program in the background. You can type in other commands while the other program is running. If you repeat this n times then it will be launched n times. Learn more about job control in bash by consulting the manual.\n\nA: To open it 3 times, call it like this:\n   for i in {1..3}; do xpdf some.pdf & done\n\nAn alias will not work for the general case, since you have 3 parameters, and aliases don't allow for parameters:\n\n\n*\n\n*N the number of times to run\n\n*prg the program to run\n\n*file the file to open with the program \n\n\nSo you could write a function to include in your .bashrc: \n #!/bin/bash\n xtimes () {\n     for i in $(seq 1 $1); do $2 $3 & done\n }\n\nYou can't use {1..$1}, because in curly braces, there is no parameters expansion. \n", "Q: What Ubuntu alternatives will still be supported after 12.04 I have read today that Kubuntu might not be supported after the 12.04 release. Is this true? and if yes, what other ubuntu alternatives have the same fate and why?\n\nA: The article I read said that Kubuntu will not have a paid Canonical employee on the project.  The result is Kubuntu will be on a similar playfield as Xubuntu/Lubuntu, which are still supported.  \n\nA: On the IRC chat for Kubuntu yesterday, the Kubuntu Devs were a little disappointed they lost paid financial support from Canonical, but they will continue to develop and support Kubuntu regardless of the financial support.  Lubuntu, Xubuntu, etc. all are similar in that Canonical does not give them direct funding.\n\nTo give an actual answer to what is actually \"supported\" 12.04 and later, in terms of \"Official Derivatives\" (derivatives which are official, to some extent, regardless of Canonical paid financial support), the following are, at the very least, the current derivatives which are still actively considered \"official\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Kubuntu\n\n*Xubuntu\n\n*Lubuntu\n\n", "Q: What music player shows \"similar bands you might like\" feature In 11.04 I used banshee or rhythmbox because it had a feature that told me, when I was listening to a song what other bands from other similar groups I would enjoy. Most of the time it was correct or at least it helped me find a group I have not heard for a long time.\nIn 11.10 neither of them have this feature or at least I do not know which one had it and how to activated it again.\nWhat music player has this particular feature in 11.10\n\nA: Banshee still has that. You have to make sure that you have enabled the Last.FM-scrobbling plugin in the settings and then check the context pane under view to be shown.\nI don't know about Rhythmbox but other than that, Tomahawk player has a similar feature.\n\nA: I found that feature in Songbird (in Ubuntu for the moment works perfectly a sort of portable version- just unpack - I got it here) - a player with a lot of  custom features downloadable from within the player itself. Songbird has an internet browser: search amongst the many add-ons. I think what you need is one called Music Recommendations: it's description says:\"Suggests similar artists based on the currently playing song\".\n", "Q: How to set CPU affinity to a process How can I set how many physical CPUs can a process use (CPU Affinity) before the process starts.\n\nA: You can do this with taskset : \ntaskset 0x03 your_command\n\nwill launch your_command on the cpus #0 and #1.\n", "Q: How do I mount a Truecrypt volume with special options? I would like to mount an ext4 truecrypt drive with --fs-options but it doesn't work. Also I created a FAT partition and the following command is working. What is the alternative command if my partition is ext3/ext4?\nsudo truecrypt --mount /media/vulturus_data/test3 /media/true  --fs-options=\"users,uid=115,gid=123,fmask=0113,dmask=0002\" \n\n\nA: Those filesystem options are available for FAT because FAT does not support file permissions. Ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems on the other hand do support file permissions. After mounting the container on /media/true:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change ownership and group membership (corresponds to uid=115,gid=123):\nsudo chown -R 115:123 /media/true\n\n\n*fmask=0113 removes the executable bit from all files and write bit from the others. This is the default, so you should not need to change it. Anyway, the command to do so is:\nsudo find /media/true -type f -exec chmod a-x,o-w {} \\;\n\n\n*dmask=0002 is supposed to remove the write bit from directories for the world. This bit is usually not set. To remove it in case it is set:\nsudo find /media/true -type d -exec chmod o-w {} \\;\n\n\nA: make sure there's a directory under /media/ called true\nrun the following commands to make sure \nsudo mkdir /media/true\n\n\nA: Probably --fs-options=\"...\" must be put before the volume path and mountpoint:\nsudo truecrypt --mount --fs-options=\"users,uid=115,gid=123,fmask=0113,dmask=0002\" /media/vulturus_data/test3 /media/true\n", "Q: Unable to login after deleting my home partition? I deleted my /home partition now I am unable to log on.  When I log on as Guest I get a blank desktop\nIs it possible to fix this preferably without reinstalling?\n\nA: You'll need to do two things\n1 Recreate /home and update /etc/fstab to mount it in the proper place\n2 Recreate your /home/username folder by copying /etc/skel\nStep 1\nBoot a live disk (or your OS if you can) and create a filesystem where your /home partition used to be. Find the UUID of this partition by matching up it's entry in ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid or by using blkid. Update the entry in /etc/fstab to match this new number.\nStep 2\nAlso from the live environment, copy /etc/skel to your new home partition (after mounting it on say, /mnt) and rename it to your user's shortname. E.g., cp -R /etc/skel /mnt/username. Lastly, take ownership of everything in your homedir. This will be tricky as you don't know your numeric UID. Easy way is to make it all chmod -R 777 /home/username/ and then chown -R root:root /home/username and then reboot to your resotred user account and do the same but with your username. You will have to redo all of your settings, but it is better than nothing.\n", "Q: Best practice to monitor Ubuntu Server I have an Ubuntu Server that is intermittently rebooting. I notice the reboot once every 3 weeks or so. I have a feeling that this is occurring more often and I want to get an accurate picture of the problem and how often it is occurring. \nI was thinking about configuring an email that would be sent on server boot, but I wanted to ask the question here to see what is the best practice for monitoring servers. Noticed that you can configure server to send email by using Bootmail or by script using cron. I also noticed Nagios, but that seems a bit more complicated and detailed. What is the best practice for monitoring Ubuntu Servers? I am looking for something simple but yet flexible and powerful. The less shell scripting the better. \n\nA: this is the list of Linux monitoring tools: (http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/top-linux-monitoring-tools.html). As you can see, there is Nagios as well. You did not specified the services you want to monitor. \nIf you need a log reader, you can try Splunk, which is free for small amount of log data. For web-server I would choose one of the many web-stat programs. Hope this will help. For database you need to monitor free disk space, tablespace sizes and CPU overloads. For simple fileserver I would choose just mail-ping (cron job is sending email/sms to your mobile.) \nThere are many levels of monitoring, so this much depend of what is the service your server offers, on SLA you need to reach and money you can spend.\n\nA: Try SeaLion it's a free linux monitoring system. You just have to install an agent program and that's it. It can monitor any custom commands, shell scripts, log output etc...\nIt helped me a lot when I was in situation where need to find out what went wrong at specific time on my Ubuntu server? I can easily figure out which processes were running at that time which caused high CPU, Memory and I/O wait. I recommend this tool for it's intuitiveness and ease of installation and setup.\n", "Q: how to edit etc/usb_modswitch.d? Hello I would like to enter a text file with some code in this directory(etc/usb_modswitch.d). How can I do this? please help me.

So How can I become the root and able to copy paste a file there or is it possible to to do this changes by using terminal?\nThanks.\nMy os is ubuntu 11.10 version.\n\nA: Open a terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t (don't worry, you'll use it only to invoke the text editor with sudo privileges).\nOn the terminal type:\nsudo gedit\n\npress enter and input your password when prompted.\nPresto, the gedit editor should be running with root permissions!\n", "Q: Are there any known vulnerabilities to Ubuntu's full disk encryption feature? Are there any known vulnerabilities to Ubuntu's full disk encryption feature?\nI have some storage devices (thumbdrive and a few external hard drives used for backups) that I use with full disk encryption, so that if they're lost or stolen, my data can't be retrieved. Is this a false sense of security?\nIf someone were to obtain an encrypted drive, would it be possible for them to break the encryption, and if so, how long would it take?\nEDIT: To clarify, I'm only asking about non-bootable drives. I'm aware of vulnerabilities to encrypted drives that are still used to boot the OS.\n\nA: There are no currently known vulnerabilities in encryption in Ubuntu 11.10. There have been some. Generally the ecryptfs vulnerabilities involved an attacker already logged into your system who could cause denial of service. There was a LUKS problem in which users were surprised that a simple configuration option in a partitioning tool could fully and permanently destroy a partition.\nIn about 5 * 10^9 years, we expect this planet will be engulfed by the expanding Sun. AES-256 encryption can quite possibly resist attack for that long. However, as you seem to be aware, there are many other potential weaknesses and they bear repeating.\nWill you know that you encrypted the disk effectively? It's complicated. Thoughtful people disagree about which installation options are sufficiently effective. Did you know that you're supposed to install full-disk encryption from Ubuntu's alternate install CD using LUKS, not ecryptfs? Did you know that LUKS has stored the passphrase in RAM in plain text, or that once a file is unlocked by any user via ecryptfs, then ecryptfs does not protect it from any other user? Was your disk ever connected to a system that permitted attaching unencrypted storage, rather than setting an explicit SELinux policy to prohibit that? Where did you keep your backups of your encrypted disk? You made backups because you knew that encrypted disks are much more sensitive to normal errors, right?\nAre you sure your passphrase is not among the top billions (more like trillions, or whatever it is now) of possibilities that might be guessed? Is the person attempting to decrypt your disk really a random, poorly motivated and funded, unresourceful stranger? Are you sure your passphrase could not have been obtained by software tampering (\"evil maid\" attack), observing the running system (\"shoulder surfing\", \"black bag\" or \"cold boot\" attacks), etc.? How well have you avoided attacks that everyone gets: email and download viruses, malicious JavaScript, phishing?\nHow deeply are you committed to keeping your passphrase secret? What jurisdictions will you be in? Would you be content to go to prison? Are there other people who know the secrets that are protected by your disk encryption? Do you want to pay the price for your secrets even if those people reveal them?\n", "Q: Feed my AppleTv with media from my Ubuntu desktop PC I'm about to buy an AppleTv and I'm wondering if it is possible to access the media that are hosted on my ubuntu PC.\nAt home, I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Ubuntu PC with all my media on it\n\n*A Windows Laptop (not always available/running) that I'm using to configure my IPad2 (and soon, my AppleTv)\n\n*An IPad2\n\n\nFor what I understand:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleTv can access the media via ITunes if it is opened on my Windows laptop.\n\n*I can stream media from my IPad2 to the AppleTv (in the case ITunes is not available)\n\n\nIs it possible for me to setup my Ubuntu PC to send media via Airplay to the AppleTv?\n\nEDIT : If it is not possible via airplay, any other suggestion are welcomed.\n\nEDIT2 : What about intalling XBMC or thin Plex client on a jailbroken Apple TV (2nd or 3rd gen)?\nThanks\n\nA: One possibility would perhaps be to run iTunes on the Ubuntu PC through Wine. From what I've heard, the syncing part doesn't work, but the airplay features does.\nSecond option is using Ubuntu One, if you only want to play audio as per : The Ubuntu One Blog\nThird solution would be to install a media server on the Ubuntu PC as this guide dictates.\nDisclaimer: Haven't got an Apple TV or even a Mac myself, so I haven't tested any of the proposed solutions. =) \nHappy testing!\n\nA: A quick Google search provided this link that includes a few scripts and step by step documentation.\n\nA: If you want a easy but $$$ way, check out the AirPlayer http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airplayer/id369713694?mt=8\nIt is $4.99 though but you wont have to use itunes to stream and is confirmed to work with other media serving software like PS3 Media Server or Serviio (Installs are easy with these 2)\n\nA: You can install the mt-daapd package which is an iTunes compatible DAAP server.\n\nmt-daapd, now known as the Firefly Media Server, is a DAAP (Digital\n  Audio  Access Protocol) server that works with most POSIX-compatible\n  operating  systems. It allows you to share your music collection over\n  the local network  using the DAAP protocol also used by Apple's\n  iTunes.\n\nMore information on how to use it and links to the Launchpad page can be found here.\nThere is an example available on the Ubuntu Forums on how to set it up as well\n", "Q: Can I modify the keyboard shortcut for workspace switching?

I'm looking for a command line program to capture audio from a microphone, save and stream it over a WAN. \narecord test.wav seems to work for recording input, but I cannot figure out how to get it to save as an mp3 for file size reduction. \ncould I stream audio over SSH? would VLC work?\n\nA: If you'd rather not get too heavy about this, you can just stream over the raw sound, like you suggest in your question. You can also convert it to MP3 (or another codec - speex might be worth it, if it can be streamed) to save a bit of bandwidth.\nHere's what I'm running successfully here:\nssh oli@bessy \"arecord -q -t raw | lame -x -r -\" | mpg321\n\nThat just uses arecord to record from the default source (-q is there to keep it quiet). That can, of course, be tuned. That recording data gets piped through lame which is an MP3 encoder. That output is received back over SSH to your client machine, where it gets piped into mpg123, a command line MP3 player.\nNote I have SSH key authentication set up, so there's no password prompt. I'd suggest you do something similar.\nYou might have issues with arecord. I tried it on our media centre first of all but that wasn't having any of it. I stopped trying to guess which device it wanted me to use and tried the laptop which \"just worked\".\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure what your end game is (intercom, just broadcast, etc) but there are a number of options based on existing tech:\n\n\n*\n\n*Group chat options like TeamSpeak are good for multiple applications where you want a talk-on-demand feature but require a client-server structure. It's all free and it's probably the best set up for a very-low-bandwidth situation. \n\n*Radio streams like IceCast (see here for help on setting it up) are good when you're got a little more bandwidth to play with. It still uses an intermediary server to stream the audio out to clients but this can be installed on your local computer.\n", "Q: Broadcom 4312 wireless issues \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to Install Broadcom / STA Wireless card (BCM43XX) \n\nI know theres a plethora of other questions and some are \"Solved\" out there for this same issue but I've run through all that I can find to no avail.\nI solved this problem once but then I went on to troubleshoot an injection issue fora nother program and I messed up the wireless so I reinstalled and now I can't get it working again!

Now again >.< I'm now fairly certain as to what fixed this.\nActually there's still one step I question the relevance of, though I'm sure in the end it's worth doing regardless and that is to get all possible updates through your software manager.\nNext if you don't already have Synaptic Package Manager get it. In Synaptic, make sure you have\nbcm-kernel-source, b43-fwcutter, and depending on your chipset (in this case) firmware-b43-lpphy-installer.\nNext you want to go to terminal and put in gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and scroll right on down to \n## # replaced by b43 and ssb.\n##blacklist bcm43xx\n\nSo you can put a # right next to blacklist bcm43xx so you end up with: \n## #blacklist bcm43xx \n\nGo ahead and reboot to get all this loaded up.

I did notice that my proprietary driver that Linux wanted to install initially is activated.\n\nA: That's the LP-PHY model like on my dell 1747, so you'll need the lp-phy b43 driver, which looks like you might have already.  \nMake sure you remove any b43 driver previously installed through 'additional drivers' or via apt.  \nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge b43-fwcutter\nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo modprobe wl\nifconfig eth2\n\nIf that doesn't work then purge that driver, sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source. \nThen install this one sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-lpphy-installer \nSome say that one works for them where the bcmwl does not.\n\nA: I think that the network card switches are inhibiting your connection. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make completely sure there is not a hardware switch keeping your network card off.\n\n*Run sudo rfkill unblock wifi. This should remove every soft block related to your network card.\nPlease check this and report back. If this doesn't happen, perhaps your computer doesn't let both wireless virtual devices to be active at the same time.\n\n*I recommend you to blacklist your dell_laptop module. This was giving me wireless connection problems once too.\nsudo echo dell_laptop >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-<username>.conf\n\n*Make sure you only have one network card driver loaded at a time.

I want to run FireFox pinned to the desktop and prevent other windows from ever ending up behind it.\n\nA: Does right-clicking on the window title and selecting \"Keep below others\" from the dropdown menu solves your problem? I do not have access to a Unity environment at the moment, but as I remember the option always was there.\nUPDATE: Ok, after some checking I've found that the option is present in KDE, XFCE and LXDE (Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu, respectively), but is disabled/hidden in Gnome, even in older versions. \nAlso, it seems that GTK does have the required functionality, so it's just a matter of Gnome developers' preference not to expose \"unnecessary\" or rarely-used settings (\"settings kill kittens\", as they say). There may or may not be a hidden key somewhere which enables the menu item.\nUPDATE 2: I was going to propose you to write a small program which finds a window using, say, gtk_get_window_at_pointer API call and sets it as \"always on bottom\" with gdk_window_set_keep_below API call (in case you don't mind some programming), but it appears everything has been written for us already: there's a program called Devil's Pie (and also GDevilsPie) which are available in Ubuntu repositories.

KDE combines the second monitor with TWinView to all my virtual desktops. While this is nice I'd rather had an additional virtual desktop (let's say desktop #5) fixed to my second monitor while switching beetween desktop #1 to #4 on my first monitor. \nCan this been done? (KDE 4.8, Ubuntu 11.10)\nAt the monent I can only use the following workaround: \ndrag an application to the second monitor on desktop #1 and apply \"fix to all desktops\" on the window in question. Then when switching desktops the window shows on all of them but is fixed to a position on the second monitor. While this works it'd be more convenient if I could have an independent desktop on my second monitor with it's own activities; panels and stuff. And when starting an application there it should stay there also ... \nI also tried to configure the second monitor as individual X-Server-Dislpay. But then still I can't send running applications over to the second screen ... \n\nA: This answer is for KDE 4.x. For KDE Plasma 5, check out the other answer m0h17.\n\nI'm actually running KDE 4.9.4 atop ArchLinux, but it shouldn't matter. Since KDE treats the screen as one (mostly), switching Virtual Desktops will switch them on all screens. However, there's a handy \"On all Desktops\" button in every window titlebar (near the app logo, you enable/disable that in SystemSettings->WindowDecorations->ConfigureButtons). Click that, and your application will remain there even if you switch the desktops. It's a workaround, but it works.\n\nA: Use the Virtual Desktops Only On Primary script from https://github.com/wsdfhjxc/kwin-scripts\nClone the repo, and run the script.\ngit clone https://github.com/wsdfhjxc/kwin-scripts.git\ncd kwin-scripts/\n./helper.sh install virtual-desktops-only-on-primary\n\nAfter installing the script, go to System Settings > Window Management > KWin Scripts and enable the Virtual Desktops Only On Primary script.\n\nThere will be no need to manually set the Window Settings every time.\n", "Q: Dynamic Ip not working from the LAN I've configured a dynamic IP following this instructions:\nhttp://ubuntulinuxhowto.blogspot.com/2006/06/dynamic-dns-no-ip.html\nThe dynamic IP is working allright from outside the LAN, redirecting it to my computer which is 192.168.1.50, but when I try to access it from inside the LAN, what I get is the configuration-page of the router, which is in 192.168.1.1\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: You are missing nothing. This is how simple NAT works. You can work around the issue by adding your dynamic name to the hosts file in your computer and assign it to your local IP (better add it to the router if it allows it).\nLet's say that your router has 192.168.0.1 as its internal address and 200.200.200.200 as it's external (internet facing) IP. The external dns are going to resolve your name to the external IP of the router (200.200.200.200). Your computer will ask the router to connect to this IP, and it knows it is its own. As the router is only doing NAT from outside to inside, it will answer it the same way that any other internal query (showing it's configuration page). \nWhat I'm trying to explain is that it's not like your query is going out to the internet and enter again through the router, it will never leave your own LAN.\nIf you really want to change this, you can try to flash your router with an open firmware that allow more complex configurations, but I don't really believe that it's worth the trouble.\nI believe that the saner configuration is to make your name to resolve to another IP for the internal network.\n", "Q: How to run gui app from cron as root?

How am I supposed to run/install acpi_call? I've found a similar solution on the linux hybrid graphics blog, but still couldn't manage to run it.\n\nA: If you do not know how to use that kernel module, I suggest you to stay away from it. In the past it has been used for disabling discrete video cards directly, but that does not make the kernel aware of the state change. The test_off.sh file should not be used as it's just wildly guessing some calls which may have negative effects on the hardware and software (e.g. crazy fans, lockups).\nIf you want to disable NVIDIA cads, have a look at Bumblebee which comes with bbswitch, a module for toggling the power of nvidia cards on Optimus laptops.

After installing the PPA you can open a terminal, load the acpi_call module and perform an ACPI call by writing to the file.

When you first boot, one of the options is to check the CD (I think). You can do this, to verify that indeed your CD is in good condition. With the too many problems related to CDs that are burned at home, I now use USB keys with the ISO files, that I just recycle as new versions/distributions are published on the net. \nIf your computer CANNOT boot from usb, there are some small distributions that you can put on a floppy or CD, boot from it, and then get access to boot from a CD. \nFinally, the last resort would be to remove the hard disk from your laptop, and set it in a desktop with the cabling for it. Boot your desktop and install on THAT hard disk, taking precautions to install the bootloader on THAT hard disk, not /dev/sda by default (this is your own internal first hard disk). Although this is a riskier solution, I used this to install on an old laptop which had a defective cdrom reader, and could not boot from USB. \n\nA: Humm! they are mistake into the tracks of the Hard Drive Disk.\nTry installing Windows 7, Later install Linux Ubuntu. or before other Linux Release.\nIf the problem continues, change your Hard Drive Disk, or other device, mmm!

I would like to switch between the default German layout and an English (US) one.\n\nA: You can use Lxkeymap under preferences.\nThere is a Keyboard Layout Switcher under Panel Preferences / Panel Applets.\n\nA: This is a general solution including solving other possible problems when setting keyboard layouts and changing them with shortcuts. I have tested this in Lubuntu oneiric, precise, and quantal.\n- First, using the GUI Keyboard Layout Handler\nRight click on the Keyboard Layout Handler button from the LXPanel\n\nThen \"Add\"\n\nThere are different types of layouts for the same language\n\nAlso set the shortcut (Change Layout Option).\n\n\n*\n\n*In case the GUI might not work or is not present in 11.10 etc\nor settings are nor respected after logout, or they are not translated in practice etc. (it happened often to me in 11.10, not anymore after 12.04).\nCheck current xkb parameters with:\nsetxkbmap -query\n\nI'll give an example with three languages, US Englush, French and Romanian standard. For German it is \"de\" I think.\nSo, to set us,fr,ro layout with variants default (us), (fr) and standard (ro) that can be changed with ALT-SHIFT keys:\nsetxkbmap -layout \"us,fr,ro\" -variant \",,std\" -option \"grp:alt_shift_toggle\"\n\nTo test if all are OK and make all changes permanent (if gedit is the preferred text editor):\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/keyboard\n\nSee that parameters are according:\nXKBMODEL=\"pc105\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"us,fr,ro\"\nXKBVARIANT=\",,std\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"grp:alt_shift_toggle\"\n\nSee that the settings in Keyboard Layout Handler are exactly the same regarding also order, subtype and shortcut.\n- Other possible issues.\nIn 12.10 I had a more bizarre problem. In spite of doing the above two steps only the main language was accessible. This was solved by removing and reinstalling all secondary languages (all except the main one) and adding the secondary languages as in the previous steps.\n\nA: As arno says, try: \nsetxkbmap -option grp:alt_shift_toggle \"us,il\"\n\n(for hebrew).\nTo make this permanent:\n echo '@setxkbmap -option grp:alt_shift_toggle \"us,il\"' | sudo tee -a /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart\n\n\nA: The permanent solution provided by user1112507 worked for me in Lubuntu 12.04, but not in 12.10 where setxkbmap apparently needs to delay before executing.\nHis solution, modifying /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart, is for all users. Here is a workaround for the single-user case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the desired languages.\n$ gnome-language-selector\n\n\n*Create a shell script to execute setxkbmap after a delay and save it in a convenient place. Running it in the background may speed up the login process. Increase sleep time if needed. Replace \"us, il\" with your desired language codes.\n$ echo '(sleep 2; setxkbmap -option grp:alt_shift_toggle -layout \"us,il\") &' > ~/setxkbmap.sh\n\n\n*Make the script executable and verify that it works by toggling the key combination Alt-Shift to switch language.\n$ chmod +x ~/setxkbmap.sh\n$ ~/setxkbmap.sh\n\n\n*Create a .desktop file which executes the shell script just created. Replace \"username\" with your username.\n$ echo '[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Keyboard Language Switcher\nExec=/home/username/setxkbmap.sh\nIcon=/usr/share/lxkeymap/media/icon.png\n' > ~/Desktop/setxkbmap.desktop\n\n\n*Logout and login again, then test by clicking on the new icon on your desktop, then toggling Alt-Shift.\n\n*Move the .desktop file to ~/.config/autostart\n$ mv ~/Desktop/setxkbmap.desktop ~/.config/autostart\n\n\n*Logout and login again, then test by toggling Alt-Shift.\n", "Q: How do I dual boot Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 with EFI?

IO have switched around nvidia drivers but no luck.\n\nA: Yes, a screenshot would be helpful.

Display works normally during boot, after which the desktop is displayed momentarily before blanking out. The gnome-shell menus are not visible during this brief flicker of desktop. \nIt seems that the laptop is behaving as if there is an external monitor connected and set as the primary display, without mirroring or extending to the internal display. \nHere are some observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I connect an external monitor, my desktop appears on it.\n\n*I can then successfully use Displays (system settings) and xrandr to turn on the internal display (which is set to off), and can then mirror or extend across both displays.\n\n*Once I've turned on the laptop screen and set it as primary, I can disconnect the external monitor and use the laptop display independently.\n\n*If I boot the laptop without an external display (in which case I get the blank screen), I can switch to an alternative terminal, e.g. tty1, at which point my internal display functions correctly, but if I return to tty7 it blanks out again, and at this stage I can no longer switch to tty1, tty2, etc.\n\n*I can boot into Windows without problems.\nI think it's possible that I meddled with some settings somewhere in the past in order to set the external monitor as the primary display when the laptop was docked. In this case I wonder if someone might direct me to potential files that I might have modified (and remind me of the changes that I may have made), so that I can revert to the original settings. This would have been a while back though, I think, in Ubuntu Maverick or Natty (and I don't know whether such modifications would persist on upgrade). This is a recent development, though, so I think there's more to it than that.\nI can't think of any software installation or changes to system files that might coincide with the problem appearing.\nDoes anyone have any ideas for what's going on here, or how to diagnose the problem? If there's a command I can use to print out relevant system info, please let me know and I'll update the question with the details.\n\nA: Open the run dialog by typing Alt+F2\nThen type rm ~/.config/monitors.xml and press Enter\n\nA: We use a lot of Lenovo's in our business but most have a Nvidia display card as opposed to an Intel like the X200. We use a secondary external monitor as the primary monitor and in the beginning experienced the same problem as you are currently experiencing.\nThe way we resolved the problems was a two step process, firstly in the BIOS under Display, Graphic Device we changed 'Integrated' to 'Discrete'. Then secondly, and unfortunately this is where the solution veers off your path, is that we downloaded & installed the latest drivers from the Nvidia website, this provided an additional Nvidia configuration utility like the one you would find in Windows and the management of primary & secondary monitors was easily achieved.\nThat's about all I have for you unfortunately, there are a few additional settings under the Display heading in the BIOS that may also help.\nBest of luck.\nmilo\n\nA: In my case, the root of this problem was Jupiter, which I'd installed some time ago for power management. Jupiter has some options for adjusting display settings, including output device, and these are saved and restored on startup. Changing the Jupiter 'Video Displays' to 'Internal Display Only' has corrected the problem. I might switch this to 'Enable Both Displays', as it's probably necessary to have my external operating when connected.\n\nA: I also had a similar issue where when I set the primary display to external monitor, my laptop monitor would not work after login. And the reason for the problem was that I modified Nvidia X Server Settings. To resolve the issue, simply remove the X server configuration file (which would set the X server to default)\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nIn case you are not able to find where the configuration file is saved, do the following steps\n\n*\n\n*Open Nvidia X Server Settings\n\n*Goto X Server Display Configuration\n\n*Click the button Save to X Configuration File\n\n*A window would pop which would show you the default path\n\nAfter locating the file delete the file and reboot (and hopefully everything should be fine now).\n", "Q: OAuth requests to Ubuntu One cloud return an empty response?

Sometimes, when downloading software from the Internet, I find that there is a .deb package ready for either my Debian/Ubuntu and also a tarball to be compiled. In the beginning I would simply use the package for its ease of installation, and wouldn't even dare attempting to compile. Even the sound of it scared me a bit. Nowadays, however, when I have the option I sometimes find myself in a dilemma: is there an unpopular advantage to compiling from source compared with the .deb package? I hope to find out here, thank you.\n\nA: The advantage of compiling from source is that you can compile packages with certain flags/options which may be missing/disabled in stock-standard Ubuntu packages. Also, it makes it easy to have multiple versions of the same program installed. Also, you can choose an exact version of a package which may be already removed from or not yet present in Ubuntu repositories (example: I have several versions of Python 2.4.x in my /opt/ directory as I need it to run some older software).\nThe disadvantage of compiling from source is that, unless you build a .deb and then install it, the normal \"./configure; make; sudo make install\" procedure keeps Ubuntu's package manager completely unaware of the changes you're making, so you're not going to get any updates for the manually-compiled software; and it's possible that package manager will later override/break your package if you're not careful to install it in a separate location.\nIn short: Always consider installing from standard Ubuntu repositories first, next consider installing a .deb; only compile from sources if you know exactly why you need to do this. \n\nA: I was arguing on this just yesterday. I think it is extremely important to not build anything fragile, as it is known that there is no such as up to date and good documentation, especially when you are working with a fragile system, there will be no time to fight the fire and write documentation, and where everything is robust the documentation is not needed that much. So you should never ever compile from source, find another solution, use another software, change your architecture, but do not use something that will break after update. And yes it has no anything to do with kernel version, it is about the architecture of your machine, and in nowadays you hardly can get significant difference with compiling from the source code, I bet you will not get any.\n\nA: It's certainly much easier to install the .deb, although if you can, the best bet is to find it in a repo or a ppa, so that you can be provided updates.\nAFAIK there's no real benefit to compiling it yourself unless you plan to alter it first.  If you just want the software as is, then install the .deb\n", "Q: My USB test drive hangs on boot. How can I get it to boot with the right options?

Press F6 for modes, and try combinations of nomodeset, acpi=off, noacpi and nolacpi until the computer boots successfully. I wish I could tell you which combination, but it varies from computer to computer and so you'll just have to do some experimenting.

I inserted a CD in the rom, and I see the files just fine in nautilus, but when I try to run the following command\nsudo mount -l\nit gives me all the mount points, except one for the CD. I looked in \"/mnt/\" folder and there are no subfolders. \"/media/\" folder has a folder name cdrom but is empty and doesn't seem to be mounted. So where exactly is my CD mounted? I also cannot find anything that looks like a CDROM device name in \"/dev/\".\n\nA: Audio CDs are a bit different - there's no actual filesystem there and as such they can't be mounted. Gnome's gvfs subsystem (which stands for \"virtual filesystem\") provides a file-like view of tracks on the audio CD, but it does it by directly accessing the device, without actually mounting it. So the tracks on the Audio CD look like files, but in fact they're not. They don't have real filenames, file size in bytes or other attributes of normal files.\nYou can convert those tracks to normal .mp3 or .ogg files using CD-ripping software if you need.\nThe \"mount points\" for gvfs (though they're not real mount points) are created in ~/.gvfs folder. There's supposedly also gvfs-mount command which can list/manage the mounts\nGoogling for \"gvfs cdda\" will provide you with additional information if you're still curious.\n", "Q: How do I take my playlists from Banshee and put them on Itunes and my Ipod?

Check youtube for tutorials.\nsudo apt-get install picard\n\nA: Yes, you can; and it's easy.\nSimply: adjust your 'preferences' settings, re-import the relevant files, select all (relevant) files for editing, open the editor, select the relevant options, and 'save'.\nPlease note that it may be necessary to restart Banshee for each folder you wish to update, especially if you have folders dedicated to different file formats. The point is that it is expedient to be very specific, when using Banshee, but you do have control of you files, if you're prepared to put in a little effort.\n", "Q: Why do I have two (2) launchers after customizing my Unity setup with ccsm? Just installed Ubuntu Oneric (11.10) and Compizconfig Settings Manager, made some tweaks, everything is looking great. However, now I have two launchers and these settings do not start automatically if I logout and log back in.  \nI would appreciate any help you can provide.\nPS: all my drivers are up to date, my PC is an Acer with a AMD Athlon 64x2 Dual core Processor and a Nvidia Graphic card with 3D capability.\n\nA: Unity is a plugin in Compiz, and when you enable certain settings it activates Unity 3D, the unity version used with Compiz. This version will overlap Unity 2D native in 11.10. I fixed this by disabling the unity plugin in Compiz and re-enabling it. It then asked me to resolve conflicts, which I did. This disabled the Unity 2D and displayed only the customized one.\n", "Q: Separate panels for separate workspaces in tint2 I am running Ubuntu 11.10 x64. I have tint2 installed in an attempt to get a GNOME2-like bottom-panel. \nSuppose I have windows A, B, and C open on Desktop 1, and windows D and E on Desktop 2.

I am actually implementing some functionality to it, and since I noticed, I am able to wake up my laptop from sleep by just opening the lid on Windows 7, however, I need to press to power button to wake up in Ubuntu. Using a program called i-nex, I noted that the kernel DOES dettect a \"lid switch\", and I am looking forward to use it to wake up function. Any ideas?\n\nUPDATE:\nThanks @yossile for bringing up some clues! However, output of command cat /proc/acpi/wakeup does not show the LID device. I still tried the second set of commands you gave me with no effect. Then I tried experimenting, guessing that LID should be named by other value, so I tried enabling the others. No victory so far. But I noticed that devices that did not have any pci listings were disabled at all time no matter what I tried. Here is the output of command cat /proc/acpi/wakeup:\nroot@samsung:~# cat /proc/acpi/wakeup\nDevice  S-state   Status   Sysfs node\nPCE4      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:04.0\nSBAZ      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:14.2\nP0PC      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:14.4\nGEC       S4    *disabled  \nPE20      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:15.0\nPE21      S4    *disabled  \nPE22      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:15.2\nPE23      S4    *disabled  \nPWRB      S5    *enabled\n\nSo maybe it could be that LID is either GEC,PE21, or PE23?\nStill, there is /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state file which shows that LID is opened.\nAny more ideas?\n\nA: You can check whether the Lid open event is configured to wake up your OS by executing the cat /proc/acpi/wakeup command.\nIf the status of the 'LID' device is currently disabled you can try enabling it by executing:\nsudo -s\necho \"LID\" > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nThis will set the status to enabled.\nRunning the commands again will set it back to disabled.\n\nA: In my case, I also had to set in BIOS, to use sleep optimized for linux instead of windows.\n", "Q: How can I look at the log file for details as I get 'permission denied'?

I have virtualbox running on a Windows 2008 server, with a guest running ubuntu 10.04. The ubuntu guest is given a static IP of 192.168.1.4, which also has openssh installed. The guest has bridged network setup, I can ping 192.168.1.4 from any machine in the LAN, the ubuntu guest can also access the LAN. However, when I try to PuTTY into the ubuntu machine, I always get \"connection refused\". Below are some setup details:\nubuntu IP: 192.168.1.4\nhosts.allow\nsshd : 192.168.1.38\n\nhosts.deny\nALL : ALL\n\nwhen I the following command, I can see that sshd is listening on port 22:\nlsof -i tcp:22\n\nAny idea?\nEDIT:\nIt turned out to be a wrong VirtualBox Bridged Network setup. I give the Ubuntu guest a static IP of 192.168.1.4 (assigned to eth0). Then in the Windows 7 host, in the Network and Sharing Center, there is a new connection named \"VirtualBox Host-Only Network\" after the bridge is setup, that connection is again given the same static IP of 192.168.1.4. Once I change the \"VirtualBox Host-Only Network\" to automatically obtain an IP address, it's getting a different IP address of 169.254.249.70(Tentative). And now I can SSH into 192.168.1.4 with no problem, even without touching hosts.allow and hosts.deny.\nI've also noticed that in the properties windows (see screenshot below) of the \"VirtualBox Host-Only Network\", the second checkbox, \"VirtualBox Bridged Networking Driver\" is unchecked. While the same checkbox of the physical NIC (that is bridged to) is checked. So my further question is: is this how VBox bridged networking supposed to be setup? Any rationale behind this? I'd appreciate if someone could provide some explaination on VBox bridged networking setup on Windows host and I'll accept it as an answer.\n\n\nA: Here's a similar situation and what I did to resolve.  I had my network settings set to NAT, which resulted in my guest not using the hosts network adapter. The ip was set and then I found out later: \nSearch for:\nI've installed BigBlueButton using the VM, but I can't access it from a browser\n\nOn this page:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/FAQ\nEven though I switched I needed to refresh my guest network adapter to pick up a new ip address, use the commmand ifconfig in the guest to find out what IP its using and set bbb-conf setip to that ip address result from ifconfig.  The guest will use the host's adapter to get out to the web/network.\nFor a Putty connection, run this command on your guest:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\nRun Putty with the ip from above (ifconfig result) with port 22. \nHere is a good read on host-only networking:\nhttp://christophermaier.name/blog/2010/09/01/host-only-networking-with-virtualbox\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation issues, I've seemingly lost 65GB of hard disk space Sorry for the long read but I tried to be detailed:\nJust tonight I went through the steps outlined at the Ubuntu download page, meaning I downloaded the Ubuntu 11.10 ISO and used pendrivelinux in order to make my USB drive bootable. I restart, fix boot order, and we get into the action. My first issue is that this didn't play out like the website said it would: I received no welcome screen like the one shown, just a bunch of code, then the Ubuntu symbol with a list of options under it, I picked install.\nAt this point I'm supposed to see this image, but instead all I got were the languages and a button to continue. I chose English and continued. The next to steps appeared as they were supposed to but then the 4th step was different. There was no \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" option as there is in this picture, I only had the last two options. Here I chose, \"Something else.\"\nNow when the next dialog box opened, I got very confused and did a Google search and watched some videos on YouTube and I thought I would be OK. I was wrong.\nSo I'm looking at this dialog box informing me of the various partitions on my hard drive. After Googling and YouTubing, I click on my main partition (that has Windows installed with all my various programs, files, etc.), then click \"Change...\" This partition has approximately 304GB of space, and I want to give Ubuntu 60GB, so I reduce this partition by 65GB (so I can have 5GB of space for the swap file, which I'm sure is more than enough). I change the \"Use as:\" drop down to ntfs, then hit \"OK\". I get warned about being unable to undo this, etc., etc., I hit continue and then it does it. It shrinks my partition.\nThen a curious thing happens. When in the video (would have linked the video but the spam filter doesn't allow it, can link to it upon request) and the articles, a new option showed up as \"free space,\" which you could then partition, I simply got an option labeled \"unusable,\" which was allotted 65GB.\nAfter toying with that unusable space for a bit I gave up, I quit installation and restarted to make sure Windows still worked. Everything was fine, except when I went to My Computer it said I had 65GB less of hard drive space then I used to have, which I expected. Now my question to you experts is this:\nIs there anything I can do about this? If there is, my priorities are thus:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would still like to install Ubuntu if possible, any help toward\nthat would be fantastic.\n\n*If that former is not possible, I would\nlike to try to add this space back to my main partition.\n\n\nThank you all so much for you help, it is greatly appreciated.\nEDIT: I don't know if this will help any, but my computer is an HP G62 Notebook PC, it has a Pentium Dual-Core CPU, and I have but 3GB of RAM. Hope this information helps. Thanks again!\n\nA: MBR partitioning scheme, used since the times of MS-DOS, only allows for 4 partitions to exist on a physical device. As a work-around, one of these partitions can be an \"extended\" partition, which can act as a container for more partitions (the partitions outside of an extended partition are called \"primary\".\nSo, if you have 4 primary partitions on your disk - even if you resize one of them you won't be able to use that space.\nWhat you need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*backup data on the last of your partitions\n\n*delete it using gparted\n\n*create an extended partition\n\n*create two (or more) new partitions inside the extended partition, use one of them to install Ubuntu.\n\n\n(or, alternatively, you can delete some other less important partition and then move other primary partitions around to free up some space - the point is the same, you need to remove one of the primary partitons to be able to create an extended partition. You can then create a partition inside the extended partition and restore the data you copied from the primary partition you deleted... hope this makes sense)\nUPDATE: here's the confirmation that HP G62 laptops come with 4 primary partitions already taken. Also there are some suggestions how to fix this.\nHere's a thread on ubuntuforums with some screenshots and suggestions.\n\nA: Where you see the \"free space\" and it says \"unusable\" - you will have an option that says \"Add\" - you will need to \"Add\" a partition in that unusable space.

I used to run Ubuntu and this didn't happen there.\n\nA: There are couple of settings that you should check in VLC:\n1) Tools --> Preferences --> Show All --> Video --> Disable screensaver\n2) Tools --> Preferences --> Show All --> Advanced --> Inhibit the power management daemon during playback\nIf both of this options are checked, you could try a simple wrapper script which disables the monitor modes that will power down, standby or blank the screen prior to calling VLC:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Disable modes\n/usr/bin/xset -dpms &\n/usr/bin/xset s off &\n\n#Open VLC\n/usr/bin/vlc \"$@\"\n\n#Re-enable modes\n/usr/bin/xset dpms\n/usr/bin/xset s on\nexit\n\n\nA: For me the solution was to access System Settings as root by pressing Alt+F2 to open the run dialog at the top of the screen and run\nkdesudo systemsettings \nthen go to 'Display and Monitor' to get to the 'Screen Saver' selection screen and uncheck the checkbox next to 'Automatically start after:', then click 'Apply'.  For some reason it seems that the screen saver setting is active on the root account in various versions of Kubuntu (probably in Ubuntu as well since I've seen posts for Ubuntu users experiencing this problem too).  Doing this worked for me after first trying the suggested options of disabling Display Power Management and disabling the Screen Saver on my user account.  I have not tested to see if the problem returns when those items are re-enabled but as I indicated with all of those items disabled I no longer have a problem with the screen going blank while watching videos with VLC.\n\nA: Have you tried to disable the \"Screen Energy Saving\" from the Power Management ?\nSystem Settings > (Hardware) Power Management > Power Profiles\n\nA bit older: http://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?51579-SOLVED-video-standby-every-10-minutes-when-mouse-is-not-used-(watching-a-video)\n\nA: There is a separate setting in system/settings/display-monitor that is independent from power management settings. Just go there and disable screen saver. This will take care of your problem.\n\nA: It may also help starts vlc with the \"--inhibit\" option. You can put that option in the VLC startup line editing the KickOff launcher menu: /usr/bin/vlc --inhibit %U that works on Debian Wheezy 7.8.0 vlc version 2.0.6 Twoflower (2.0.6-0-gbe9623c)\n\nA: You could install tool like Caffeine:\nCaffeine\nCaffeine is a system applet that allows the user to temporarily inhibit both the screensaver and the sleep power saving mode, simply by clicking on it. \nThis could be useful for example when watching long flash videos or playing certain full screen games that don't inhibit the screensaver by themselves. Caffeine can be set to automatically activate when any user specified application is running.\nMore info at: http://ubuntu-tweak.com/app/caffeine/\nInstallation steps:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\n", "Q: Why does my panel become grainy and distorted after I unsuspend? I frequently suspend my computer and then bring it back, usually about twice a day.\nLately, when I bring it back, the panel at the top of the screen becomes distorted.

My launcher was also getting distorted, but it would fix itself as soon as I clicked something.\nThe functionality is fine, it appears to just be cosmetic. Is there a way I can fix this issue?\n\nA: This seems to be happening less now. Perhaps there was an update to fix the issue.\nIn any case, the only way I was able to fix it without logging off was to toggle the transparency settings for the panel in CCSM.\n\nA: I fixed the problem by toggling the transparency in MyUnity. Take it down to zero to get and then scroll back up to your usual transparency. \n\nA: I have something similar - you can fix it by toggling the \"Unity Plugin\" in the CompizConfig Settings Manager (aka ccsm).\n\nA: First, confirm your display driver is installed. (System Info app->Graphics)\nUnity may not appear correctly without the display driver. However, many users are disappointed of Unity desktop. It's still buggy and slow. If you feel everything is slow, downgrade to Ubuntu 10 which is the most usable version. I believe things will work fine in Ubuntu 12 which will be released in April. You can tryout Luninux 11.10, which uses Gnome 3 instead of Unity. Luninux is MacOS like and developped from Ubuntu, but works better (See below).

Once the Bumblebee daemon detects that there are no optirun clients, it shuts down the X server. To make the X server stay alive even if optirun has exited:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf and set KeepUnusedXServer=true\n\n*Restart the daemon using sudo restart bumblebeed (beware: this will kill any existing optirun application)\n\n*Trigger a start of the X server: optirun true (true is just a command that immediately returns, it could be anything)\n\n*Run an application on the secondary X server. The LD_LIBRARY_PATH part is necessary if you are using the nvidia driver:\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-current DISPLAY=:8 metacity --replace &`\n\n\n*Run windump with: windump :8 :0\nNote: I could not get this to work with xorg-edgers/ppa+nouveau and the nvidia driver using gebarts' fork. With the nvidia driver, I got a lot tearing when running glxspheres. If the resolution of the dumped screen does not match the primary display resolution, you need to probably need to add extra modelines to /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia.

How can I get DejaDup to ONLY backup to UbuntuOne?  I installed 11.10 on a small partition two weeks ago, setup for daily backups and forgot about it. Next thing I know the disk was filled up and I didn't realize why.\nSyncing can be nice but some things I want to push off my local disk space onto the cloud storage. Like low-priority background backups.  I also can't seem to find Duplicity detailed settings like extensions to ignore, file size limit cutoff etc, though that's a separate question.\n\nA: In Deja Dup, you should be able to set your Backup Location to Ubuntu One, and then it'll only back up to there. Is that not working for you?\n\n\nA: When I run ubuntuone-control-panel-gtk \nunder the Cloud Folders tab, the first folder called  Ubuntu One is Always in sync and cannot be disabled. No problemo.\nThe second folder is deja-dup/desktop from above, and Sync Locally?  was previously enabled.\nThat might have been it.

I don't know why this shortcut appeared in the first place. However I would like to get rid of it. Right clicking on the shortcut shows that the option \"Move to Trash\" is greyed, highlighting a permission problem? \nThis option is greyed may be because I am not considered as Root (by default in Ubuntu). However I don't know where the file is and therefore can't change its permission. Can I get rid of that shortcut in a terminal ? where is the file to remove ?

I recently installed Ubuntu 11.10 as a dual boot on a fairly standard Dell Dimension, 768 RAM, Intel 2 GHz chip. The first few times I ran it it was a bit slow, with a lot of flickering of the mouse cursor, but then it seemed to settle down. Today, the screen has frozen. I was running Firefox, gedit, and Terminal. Neither the mouse nor the keyboard seem to work, although I am not familiar with the control sequences I might use in Ubuntu, such as Ctrl Alt Del (is there something like task manager on Windows?). \nCould anyone please advise me on such control sequences, and if they fail, how I can find out what is causing the problem? \n\nA: Many users are disappointed of Ubuntu 11 with Unity desktop. It's still buggy and slow. If you feel everything is slow, downgrade to Ubuntu 10 which is the most usable version. I believe things will work fine in Ubuntu 12 which will be released in April.

I want one script to open several Tabs in different folders.\nWhile searching I found this entry, but an exchange like seen below did open a Terminal with three tabs in my home folder. The error message showed: \nFailed to parse arguments: Unknown option --execute=cd /some/thing/\n\nThe script looks like this:\n#!/bin/sh\ngnome-terminal --tab --execute=\"cd /some/thing/\" \\\n          --tab --execute=\"cd /home/\" \\\n          --tab --execute=\"cd /home/\" \\\nexit 0\n\nA Variation with --working-directory=\"/some/thing/\" did also not help.\nCan you see a mistake?\n\nA: The following works for me on oneiric. You can use this in place of your version:\n#!/bin/bash\ngnome-terminal --tab  --working-directory=\"/var/www/\" --tab --working-directory='/home/' --tab --working-directory='/home/'\nexit 0\n\n\nA: Your specific error is caused by not using the --execute option properly. If you look at the excerpt from the man page below, you'll note that --execute does not have an equals sign listed as part of the syntax, as it simply executes the entire rest of the command line. An example of correct use would be:\ngnome-terminal --execute play '/home/cjohnson/Still Alive.mp3'\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nUsing cd is a bit of a special case, anyway. cd is not like most commandsâit does not launch a binary/executable of its own. It is interpreted directly by bash (or whatever shell you are using). Therefore attempting to invoke cd doesn't agree with the --execute and -x flags (which seem to want to directly spawn a child process). The same issue will occur (I've checked) with other commands which are directly processed by bash like home. Even if used properly, without the equals sign, it will still result in an error: \"File or directory not found.\" Therefore using the --working-directory=[DIRECTORY] option is your best bet for doing what you want to do.\nANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE:\nEven if this weren't the case, you would still run into trouble. The problem lies in trying to use the --execute option when you actually intend the meaning of the --command option. In the man page documentation, it states specifically\n\n-e, --command=STRING\n     Execute the argument to this option inside the terminal.\n-x, --execute\n     Execute the remainder of the command line inside the terminal.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nIn other words, it's probably not going to parse it in the way you think it should.  Using --execute prevents you from passing any further options to gnome-terminal.\nAn excerpt from one of my own scripts where I run multiple commands in separate tabs (names changed for my privacy/security):\ngnome-terminal --tab --command=\"ssh cjohnson@GLaDOS\" --tab --command=\"ssh drattman@GLaDOS\"\n(Incidentally, trying to use the --command flag with cd or home will also result in the familiar \"No such file or directory\" error.)\nI hope this isn't too long. I'm just trying to be thorough.\n", "Q: Can I place the Ubuntu One for Windows home sync folder anywhere on C:\\ during installation?

When I select \"upload file\" the choose a file option only allows media or photos. Is there a way around this as I would really like to be able to sync (manually upload) modified files from my phone?\n\nA: It is possible to upload any file type from your phone via the Ubuntu One Android app though at the current stage in its development to do this you will also need to install a file manager app. Most of the available file managers in the Android Market (or Play Store as it likes to be known now!) will work. A couple of free examples are File Manager, and Astro File Manager\nAfter you have installed a file manager launch the Ubuntu One application and press the add button and select the \"Add File\" option.\n\nYou'll get a option box pop-up, from this select the file manager that you have installed and then navigate to the file you wish to upload and select it.\n\n\nA: You cannot do it via the Ubuntu One app as far as a I know but you can move the file into your u1 directory using the \"Files\" application.\nAnything in there gets synced to the cloud and will be found in your \"Ubuntu One\" folder.\n\nA: The other answer does work - but it involves transferring one file at a time! There is no way to upload batches of files or a folder. Ubuntu One should fix this - and also enable the uploading of a folder to Ubuntu One, just as can be done from a PC.\nA simple solution is to go to Google Play and download the WiFi File Transfer app. This will then enable you to look into your Nexus from your PC and transfer files from it or to it, without having to connect it via USB. It will download the group of files as a .zip archive or as separate files.\n\nA: You can use any file browser (even the standard one) to upload your files.\nJust select the files you want with the file browser and select the share icon. In the menu that pops up you should be able to select Ubuntu one. Then choose the u1 folder where you want to upload and you're done.\n", "Q: Can't turn off syncing, option not seen in Ubuntu One dashboard I have read the Ubuntu One tutorial and seen how there should be an option to not sync directories, but here isn't an option available on the directories in my Ubuntu One dashboard.  \nI need to turn off syncing in order to store data off my computer in Ubuntu One.\n\nA: you are probably refering to this image\n\n in the tutorial here. Right?\nThe reason why you don't see this, is probably that you want to stop syncing the ~/Ubuntu One folder, which is always in sync. Only additional folders which are synced from elsewhere in your file system can be turned on/off. \n(And I don't know what your last sentence: \"I need to turn off syncing in order to store data off my computer in Ubuntu One.\" means. Maybe you could be more specific on what you need and why you need to turn off syncing for this?)\nEDIT: Ubuntu One is not designed to store your data online, it is designed to synchronize data between your computers. Therefore you will not be able to keep a folder in Ubuntu One if you don't have it synchronized to any of your computers. \n\"Stop syncing\" on the Ubuntu One website gives you a warning that the folders will NOT be deleted on your computer, but it will no longer be on the Ubuntu One servers. \nIf you have many computers, you can on each computer start/stop synchronizing the folders via Nautilus (the file manager) or via the Ubuntu One control panel (start e.g. via the mail icon in the panel and then \"Ubuntu One\"). Stopping via those ways does not remove the folders on the Ubuntu One servers, unless this was the only computer syncing that specific folder. \nIts not completely straight forward, but you will understand it, if you remember that the Ubuntu One files service is only intended for syncing, not for storing data.\n", "Q: How is disk space shared from nodes when using Ubuntu Cloud? I'm thinking about setting up a private cloud using Ubuntu with 2 nodes, but I don't quite understand how disk space from each node is handled in the cloud.\nCan somebody explain how (and if) the disk space is accessible from within the cloud? For instance when I have 2 nodes with varying amount of disk space, for example 320GB and 1TB, can I set up a \"shared storage\" from both devices?\nedit for clarification:\nCurrently I have 3 Windows Servers, consisting of a Domain Controller, a Database-/File-Server and a Web-/Mail-Server. I want to switch to an Ubuntu Server-based private cloud with VMs serving these purposes instead of dedicating each physical server to a certain job. As my database- and web-server differ largely in their available disk space, I wondered whether I can manage the entire disk space from all nodes in the cloud and make it accessible similar to using DFS in Windows AD to provide a network share that underlyingly uses two multiple servers.\nMore generally what are common practices to share disk space within a cloud based infrastructure? Are there only Key-/Value-storages, or is something like the before mentioned scenario using network shares feasible?\n\nA: There are actually a few options. In writing this answer I came across this Xen page which covers what I've said\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtual block-level-device sharing over SAN Amazon has banks of disks that are networked out to their EC2 VMs and exposed as physical disks. One drive can really only be [safely] used by one VM at a time, with the exception of making snapshot backups.\nYou'd be looking at technologies like iSCSI and nbd for this.\n\n*SAN-based network file systems Then there are the more traditional storage over IP methods like NFS. As they're essentially just another filesystem they're considerable more transparent for maintaining large repositories but they're less cross-platform (Windows and NFS don't mix well).\nThe clear advantage over block-level SANs is you can have more than one computer connected to the same data at the same time. NFS supports file locking and permissions so you can do all sorts of nifty sharing that wouldn't otherwise be possible.\n\n*Physical, local RAID And even more traditional than that, just sticking a RAID array in the host box and portioning that out to local VMs. A lot of VM providers do this still because it means you don't have a monolith disk array waiting to blow up.\nAnd that does happen. I had a lot of downtime from a VPS provider because they couldn't reliably keep their SAN online.\n", "Q: Issue with Game Display and Controls I bought a game off of the Humble Indie Bundle 4 a few months ago called \"And Yet It Moves\". It worked fine for ages, but then I stopped playing it.\nYesterday, I decided I wanted to play it a bit more, the game looked like it was going to start fine, the logos of the games producers faded in and out, the music started, but then I realized that the pause menu wasn't showing up, and that the in-game cursor wasn't moving at all. Outside of the game, the cursor was moving fine and everything was working, just this game. I'd rather not have to re-install it since I'm quite a bit of the way through, and I've searched the net but can't find anything.\nI am running Ubuntu 11.10 on HPnc6400 laptop with Intel Integrated Graphics.\n\nA: This sounds like an older bug we've already fixed.\nLet's hope this is the same one. All it takes to get rid of the black screen bug is to update to the latest version.\nSince you've bought the game via HIB4 all you need is use the download link you've received after the purchase to download the latest version (v. 1.2.2.).\nYou can also drop a message on our forums or contact us from our site in case the latest update did not work out to be the solution.\n\nA: Turns out it was to do with my internet connection. My Wireless was up but internet was down, causing the internet to appear to be working very slowly, but not actually working at all. Meaning that And Yet It Moves would get stuck connecting, not realising there was no internet connection causing a black screen with no explanation. Either having a working internet connection or disconnecting the wireless on the computer itself solved the problem.

In these environments, this key combination does not filter down to applictions.\nIn a text terminal, Alt+key is usually translated to ESC followed by the corresponding key. (This can be overridden in some terminals' configuration, but usually isn't.) So you can type Esc Tab to invoke this command.\n", "Q: install grub, but NOT in the mbr you may have become tired of the question i'm about to ask, since i've already found some posts concerning my issue. however, none of those seemed to work for me.\nso here's the thing:\nmy goal is to have dual-boot on my laptop( HP elitebook 8540w), with the win-bootloader in the mbr. i already had win7 ultimate installed, along with the win-bootloader in the mbr. so now i've installed ubuntu 11.10 on it's own partition (now I have the system-partition sda1, the win-partition sda2 and the ubuntu-partition sda5 - don't ask me why the enumeration turned out to be so weird.) after not being able to install grub to a location other than the mbr (it always ended with an error message and 'exit code 1' or something like that), i figured i could simply install it to the mbr, then remove it with the win-repair-tools, and then add an ubuntu-entry with easy-bcd to the win-bootloader. however, the last part doesn't work (even if i specify that easy-bcd can use its own copy of grub). So now i ended up with having ubuntu installed, without being able to boot into it. Hence, i'm desperately trying to somehow install grub on sda5, so that i can finally create a valid, working entry for ubuntu in the win bootloader, but kind of failed miserably so far. i already tried 'install grub' on the live cd (something like grub-install /dev/sda5), but it always returned an error message about not finding some specific files or folders (i can try it again if you need this more detailed)\nso now i'd be very very grateful for some hints how i could finally make everything work as it should :)\ncheers\n\nA: Here's the thing about the Windows bootloader. It was designed to do one thing and one thing only, boot windows. Therefore it will by default expect an NTFS filesystem with one of a handful of Windows boot files on it (NTLDR, bootmgr, winload.exe, etc). Obviously Ubuntu will not have any of these files, furthur it will be on a filesystem bootmgr can't even read.  \nSadly, what you're asking for is unrealistic, if not impossible.\n", "Q: Joysticks and gamepads in Wine I have an Xbox 360 controller with the wireless-USB pickup and I'm using the xboxdrv driver. The result is a joypad that all my native games (that know about joysticks, eg Super Meat Boy, Shank, Jamestown, XÂ², Steel Storm, etc) can use. It's awesome and would thoroughly recommend it.\nMy problem is I have a few non-native games I play through Wine. They seem to have no idea that the controller is there. I'd guess that Wine either doesn't support it or just doesn't do it automatically.\nSo is there a way?

Is there a way possible to run a laptop only on AC power without having the need to remove the battery  i.e. to disable the charging as it is possible in Windows 7.\n\nA: I think the only way this is possible would be on a hardware level. I've never heard of a laptop that had this as an option, though.\nIn Windows that is probably done by a driver for this purpose. Something like Smart Battery in DELL laptops. Not sure if that will be an option for your laptop, check the builder's website.\n\nA: According to How to charge the battery till 60-80% only?, you can use Dell's Airplane manager to enable airplane mode so now the laptop will not charge the buttery and run off AC power instead.\nYou can install it from ppa:opensource-subakutty/ppa, but personally I couldn't manage to install it on a 64-bit Trusty machine. \n", "Q: SSHFS files from one server to another I am trying to find the most secure way to transfer files from one server to another.\nI have the following architecture:\n\nCurrently I am using the main user salamis in order to mount the directories.\nThe files in the original directory are created through a PHP file manager elfinder.\nUnfortunately, I am not able to move, rename or delete any file from the mounted directory through PHP. I get permission denied.\n1) Is it because I mounted the filesystem using salamis instead of www-data?\n2) Is it secure to mount the filesystem on Server 2 as www-data ? If yes, how can I achieve that? www-data does not have a password and I cannot login using su -m www-data. I get authentication failure.\n3) Can you think of a better architecture?  \n\nA: SSHFS is a FUSE filesystem. These are managed by a user-land process which runs as the user who mounts the filesystem: that sshfs process you run doubles as the filesystem driver. By default, most FUSE filesystems only allow the mounting user to access files inside.\nIn order to be able to access files through sshfs, you need three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The user who is authenticated over ssh on server1 must be able to access the files.\n\n*The user who tries to access the sshfs filesystem on server2 must have the necessary access permissions.\n\n*The user who tries to access the sshfs filesystem on server2 must be allowed to access that filesystem.\n\n\nAs I wrote above, only the mounting user has that last permission. You can relax this by adding -o allow_user to the sshfs command line, but this won't solve the other two problems. Note that -o allow_user only takes effect if /etc/fuse.conf contains user_allow_user or you are running sshfs as root.\nOn server2, you need to either run sshfs as the www-data user (whom you will have to give access to the SSH private key), or enable allow_user and arrange for the local www-data to have access to the files it needs. There are several ways to do that: through the uid option, or by passing -o default_permissions, or by passing -o umask 770,gid=www-data. If you enable allow_user, make sure that you don't end up allowing www-data to access more files than it should, and that you don't end up allowing other users to see or modify what they shouldn't. Running sshfs as www-data has the advantage of simplicity, you have a far better chance of not accidentally being too permissive.\nFor problem #1, you need to ssh into the www-data account on server1, or to allow the account that you use to access those files. There is some benefit in not allowing remote logins to system accounts such as www-data, because these make for poor auditing (you can't know who actually used the account). However, it's not out of the question, and it is somewhat easier to set up. If you don't want to allow remote logins to the www-data account, add salamisÂ¹ to the www-data group, make sure that the filesystem on server1 is mounted with the acl option (add it to the relevant entry in /etc/fstab if necessary), and add an ACL to www-data's files:\nsetfacl -d -m group:www-data:rwx -R /path/to/www-root\nsetfacl -m group:www-data:rwx -R /path/to/www-root\n\nÂ¹  If that's your account on server1, I didn't understand from your question whether salamis was a user on server1, on server2 or both. \n\nA: 1) Yes, just like Gilles answered, the login id you use are the default owner of created files. This is true for most protocolls.\n2) Its correct there are no password for the www-data user. You can however give www-data a temporary password and copy salamis certificate to www-data with the command ssh-copy. When this is done salami can login and mount as www-data without input of any password. (You have to have a certificate built with ssh-keygen.)\n3) Another possible solution are rsync the files between the two servers. Rsync uses the same secure infrastructure as ssh/sftp/sshfs, you can use ssh-copy just like you did in 2. With rsync you can let www-data fetch the files from salami. Using ssh-copy gives you the opportunity to script the syncing, a one-liner in /etc/cron.[dayly|hourly] is sufficient in most cases.  Rsync are robust, if there are any problems with the salamis-server your application can still be functional with the last files that you synced, your application are not slowed down by the network but you have a delay between a change in a file in salamis-directory and at the server. You can also consider using a VCS, for example bzr, and fetch your files from a repository. That gives you a nice revision control of your source codes.\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu Server to act as a Gateway Connecting to an Ubuntu Server using Ethernet cables but no internet connection\nRequired to be configured is a DHCP server, with the server itself being the DHCP server and handing out the IPs to each machine. \nAlso required is the instructions to set the IP of the ethernet card on the server statically in a manner which it can be used to communicate with other systems as the DHCP server and as a file server.\n\nA: Static IP configuration should be put in /etc/network/interfaces. It is a text file, and the documentation for its format can be read by man 5 interfaces. By the looks of it, you probably need to put in there something simple like this:\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 10.1.2.3\n    netmask 255.0.0.0\n\nOnce done, submit sudo service networking restart to make use of the new settings.\nFor handing out replies to DHCP requests, you need a DHCP server, provided for example by isc-dhcp-server, udhcpd, dnsmasq and possibly other packages. I have used dnsmasq with success, and it appears to work satisfactorily even if uplink connection to internet (and real DNS servers) doesn't exist. See a how-to on the subject, it is rather straight-forward to set up.\n", "Q: Best performance: Gnome 3, Unity or Cinnamon? Which one of these three configurations consumes the least resources?\n\nA: Unity is based off of GNOME, and uses more RAM. Cinnamon is a little less resource hungry, but if you are looking for a desktop environment when resources is a factor, you might want to give LXDE a try. It's a fairly pretty desktop environment that runs in 128 megabytes of RAM. It has an interface very similar interface to KDE with less eye candy.\n", "Q: Displaying output of arbitrary command on Unity panel In my current setup running Ubuntu Natty and GNOME 2, I use the COMPA applet to display information on my top GNOME panel that I wish to always be visible on my desktop.

And that scales well with the depth of the nested sessions.  So for byobu-within-byobu-within-byobu, you'd use ctrl-a-a-a-d.\nThere is an alternative, which is what I personally use...  You could set a different escape key for the inner byobu.  I typically use ctrl-a for the outer one, and ctrl-b for the inner one.

I hope that helps because I'm just a newbie! :)\n", "Q: Create additional workspaces in gnome-shell I can't seem to create additional workspaces in Gnome-shell. Compiz says I should have four (2 by 2) but I only seem to have 2 set up. So, how do I create additional workspaces in gnome-shell?\n\nA: First of all, gnome shell doesn't use compiz, it uses mutter. \nSecond, gnome shell has something that I've dubbed \"auto workspace maker\" - that is, as you fill up one workspace, gnome creates another for you. So if you put a window in your first workspace and your second, gnome will make you a third workspace and so on and so forth.\n\nA: Try Workspace Grid, a Gnome extension. It supports both up-down and left-right workspace navigation.\n", "Q: Memcached/APC will not start with PHP  I've compiled PHP 5.3.9 and NGINX 1.0.11 and want to use APC and Memcached with PHP.

Tried to assign Alt + ' switching to another shortcut (Super + ', Ctrl + ', Alt + F1, using system settings) but nothing works.\nAfter install, everything was working fine.\nI have ' (apostrophe) instead of `. To get that, I edited files in the /etc/X11/xkb/symbols. Of course, if this matters.\nSeems like there is a problem with assigning shortcuts using system settings. When I assign between windows of the same application to Alt + Tab, it still switches between different applications. No idea what's going on.\nUPDATE: The problem is fixed.\nI've been changing different settings of my keyboard, and one of the settings changed was XKBMODEL. I set it to \"latitude\" (thought it would fit better, that was really stupid). After I changed it back to \"pc104\", everything worked normally again.\nThanks everybody for your attention!\nUPDATE 2: The ` symbol still needs to be in it's place for US layout. For Russian I was able to leave ' assigned to \"TLDE\" button.\nUPDATE 3: Seems like I have got the same problem with \"Switch between windows of the same application immediately\" (which is Alt + Esc by default). It doesn't work, and assigning it to another shortcut doesn't help. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Suboptimal, but you can use the down arrow after Alt + Tab.\n\nA: You can change the short cut key of \"switching windows\" to Alt +Tab. Then you will be able switch between windows (not applications)\nExclusive for ubuntu 18.04 LTS - search keeyboard in settings and do the above change\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04.1 the default shortcut to switch between windows of same app is \nAlt + F6\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04, at least with Vanilla Gnome3, press Alt+Esc for switching windows direct \n\nA: This was my problem too. Alt+<key above tab> didn't work to switch windows in the current application.\nIn addition, when i pressed and held down the super key to see the unity shortcuts, normally one would see this:\n\nI'm assuming that is for a US keyboard? I stole the screenshot from another post, and on my danish keyboard it now shows Alt + Onehalf.\nBut when I had this problem, I did not see the line pointed to by the red arrow!!!\nSo check if you see a keyboard shortcut for \"Switch windows of current application\". If you don't this is for you:\nThe fix was as hinted at above to change the XKBMODEL setting in /etc/default/keyboard where I changed from XKBMODEL=\"microsoft4000\" to XKBMODEL=\"pc105\". \nI did that and ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration. Not sure this last step was required.\nThen I needed to reboot.\nNow it works.\n\nA: Just use\nSwitch within same app (alt+tilt) = [Alt] + [`]\nSwitch with another app = [Alt] + [Tab]\n\nA: What about  then you Tab to your target window and Enter?\n\nA: Just press Super for 3 seconds and you will see the screen âUnity Shortcuts for Your Keyboardâ:\n\nThere you will find your shortcut according to your keyboard and yes it's Alt+The key above Tab.   \n", "Q: How do i install with makefile?

You can check on the web interface to go for sure that all files are deleted:\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/files/\nYou can also use the web interface to delete your files from the cloud (be sure that you have backup somewhere else).\nYou can stop syncing a local folder by right clicking on it in Nautilus (the default file manager), and choose the Ubuntu One -> Stop Synchronizing This Folder option. You can also use the web interface to stop sychronizing a folder: just click on the more button and choose the Stop syncing this folder option.\nYou can disable the file sync on a machine completely by starting the Ubuntu One Control Panel and remove the tick from the Enable File Sync option under the Services tab.\nAfter you have removed all your files and turned of the file syncing, you can remove your devices on the Account page of the web interface:\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/account/\n\nA: It's simple, Just find your Ubuntu One folder in you Home folder, open it and delete everything it it.

So you can just boot from that drive, install wine and any software you need and they'll be there the next time you use it. The documents in your home folder will also be preserved.\nObviously, this wouldn't work with a CD disk because it's read-only. If you want a CD drive you'll need to follow Aboobacker Mk's advice\n\nA: Yep, you can do that with Customizer. Customizer is a Ubuntu LiveCD remastering tool light years ahead of uck. It supports installing multiple desktop environments, installing additional packages not included in the default set (what you're looking for), accessing the GUI of the LiveCD through Xeypher, and much more. To install, open a terminal and run the following commands: sudo add-apt-repository ppa;customizer-dev-team/devel, sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install customizer. Once finished, open Customizer and click \"Select ISO\". Open an Ubuntu 11.10 ISO, and click \"Install Package\". Use synaptic to install the wine 1.3 package. One finished, click \"Create ISO\". Ta Da! Your own custom Ubuntu!\n", "Q: Migrating from Adobe Lightroom to Darktable Another fed-up Windows user here. Only reason I have stuck with it for so long is because I depend on Lightroom for photo editing. I want to switch to Linux and discovered Darktable. Question: Is there a way to import my existing pictures and the loss-less editing string that goes with each into Darktable? Or will all the edits be lost once I important all my photos into Darktable?\nThanks!\n\nA: The short answer to this is NO, your edits WILL be lost.\nThe reason for this is that both application does things different ways and our processing differs from each other, making it almost impossible to have 1:1 parameters between Lr and dt processing modules.\nHowever, darktable do support importing standard parts from a xmp sidecar file like rating, color labels and tags / hierarchical keywords. \n\nA: Since 2013 it is possible to import from Lightroom. Not all functions and editings will be fully imported but most of them. Details about the development you may read on the Darktable Homepage in this article.\nSo NOT ALL your edits will be lost anymore and MOST OF THEM could be importet. So give it a try, and make sure you made backup before ;-)\n", "Q: Is there a project management software for Ubuntu like Microsoft Project? I need a project management software for Ubuntu that has most (if not all) of the Microsoft Project features. Is something like this available today?\n\nA: You can try RationalPlan. They have several project management products and starting with version 4.2 it is also available in the Ubuntu Software Center. And RationalPlan Single is even free on any Linux.\n\nA: There are many tools that are web-based and which are very usable through modern web browsers available for Ubuntu, like Firefox and Chromium/Google Chrome. Some are open source and you can install them on your own server, others are provided as Software as a Service, and will --- in most cases --- be provided on a subscription basis. These 'web applications' may provide a pretty comprehensive feature set similar to that of Microsoft Project.\nIf you are looking for a desktop application that resembles Microsoft Project, is free and open source, you could try OpenProj or GanttProject. They both have some of the features Microsoft Project provides, but opinion varies as to whether they can be considered suitable alternatives.\n\nA: There is ]project-open[ as a multi-project server, that integrated with OpenProj/Project Libre and many other tools in order to form an open-source project management stack.\n\nA: I can also suggest planner .  It's available in Ubuntu software-center.\nTaskJuggler is really powerful but also a bit harder to use and is not available in Software Center.\n", "Q: Is the Rocket Raid 2340 supported? I have a server with a Rocket Raid 2340 card. I know it works in Solaris and FreeBSD, but strangely this old card doesn't work in Linux.\nThe internet is full of people asking for help, so I decided to add my voice to the party.\nThe company does not have any current drivers, and ubuntu has kernel 3.0,\nSo am I out of luck here ?\n\nA: It looks like this is indeed a fakeraid card, and the sata_mv driver supports its cousins, the 2300 and the 2310, but not the 2340.  Where I work we had a server with a rocket raid card that once decided to blow up the raid array for no good reason.  I now have Linux running on that hardware with the fake raid support disabled and using mdadm to manage the array, and the bios is still a little buggy ( it rounded down the size of the disks to the nearest gb, which screwed up grub ).  I would avoid these cards.\n", "Q: Uninstalling iTunes in Wine I've finally managed to install this program only to try and remove iTunes because every time I try to start it up, it gives me the message to reinstall it again and error 7.\nHow do I uninstall iTunes?\n\nA: Open a terminal and type wine uninstaller. Select iTunes from the list and click remove.\n\nA: First off, i think you need some clarification:  any files installed via Wine dont end up in Synaptic Package Manager, nor are they installed as packages in the Linux/Debian sense (as a result, i've removed those tags, and replaced it with wine)\nTo remove programs installed with Wine (in this case, iTunes), Configure Wine, or Wine Software tool, whichever it is, to run the uninstaller.  Or go into ~/.wine/drive_c/program files/... (whatever the path is for iTunes), and run its own uninstaller.\nAlso, in future, you should use this site to determine application compatibility with Wine.  This way, you dont have to deal with learning after-the-fact that your installed software wont work.\n\nA: I had this same issue but what I did that helped was to remove the itune fold at Nautilus. Press ALT and F2 simultaneously and type gks nautilus and look for the itune folder and delete it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One and mounted drives I'm trying to get my music onto Ubuntu One so I can keep it synced, but I'm having a problem.\nMy music is on my NAS (running on a Linux Server), it's mounted in my home directory.\nI can set the directory as synchronised, however none of the files get synced.  If I move them into a standard folder on the system they do sync though.\nIs this a problem with Ubuntu One or is it a limitation?\n\nA: This is a limitation. Currently, we don't support syncing from folders outside your home directory.\nThe main reason is that Ubuntu One does synchronization. If you synced a removable device, and then uplugged it, it would see all the files disappear, and also remove all its contents from the website and all your other devices.\n", "Q: Can uninstalling unused shipped software criple future Ubuntu upgrades? I am new to Ubuntu and I would like to uninstall many of the programs I don't use that came with version 11.10 (e.g. games, Tomboy notes, Scan, etc). Though, I am scared of the thought that by doing so - when I upgrade to a new Ubuntu version - my computer might get broken. Is there reason to fear? Or is the Ubuntu upgrade procedure bullet proof?\n\nA: No.\nUninstalling software that you don't use or want will not burst your PC into flames, cause an earthquake or destroy the planet, so don't worry as long as you don't Uninstall  needed software in which case you have to know what exactly you're uninstalling.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 fresh install in VirtualBox won't boot I installed Ubuntu on a VM in VirtualBox but after the installation Ubuntu won't boot up at all!

In my case, I really think that something is screwed up, and I cant go and do another \njuju bootstrap\n\nbecause juju says that the environment has already been bootstrapped. can I undo this, and redo the bootstrap process?\nHere is my environments.yaml file.\njuju: environments\nenvironments:\norchestra:\ntype: orchestra\n# Specify the orchestra server\norchestra-server: '192.168.*.*'\n# Specify storage.\nstorage-url: 'http://192.168.*.*/webdav'\n# Specify cobbler's user/pass\norchestra-user: cobbler\norchestra-pass: *******\nadmin-secret: *******\n# Mangement classes\nacquired-mgmt-class: orchestra-juju-acquired\navailable-mgmt-class: orchestra-juju-available\ndefault-series: natty\n\n\nA: If bootstrap has returned, all that means is that juju was able to tell cobbler (the main piece of orchestra-provisioning-server) to boot the machine. If you don't have power control defined for the profiles/systems in cobbler, and/or you don't have PXE boot by default on that machine, you'll still need to manually reboot the server and cause it to PXE boot so that it installs a fresh Ubuntu and starts the juju agents on the first boot. \nAlso, if you didn't want bootstrap to \"take\" one of your real machines, you'll need to define a profile for a VM inside cobbler and then pxe boot that VM. Another way to hack this onto the cobbler server while you're still just messing with juju is to just read the pre-seed file that is defined for a fake system, and run the agents/zookeeper directly. That is beyond the scope of this question though.\nThe bare metal story is still very new in juju (it was as much a Proof of Concept as anything in 11.10), and is still evolving. I'd recommend following its progression on the juju mailing list and in #juju on Freenode, as its likely to get a lot smoother as the use cases become more clear.\n", "Q: emacs warning Lisp directory does not exist Whenever I start my emacs, I get warning like:\nWarning: Lisp directory `/usr/local/share/emacs/23.3/site-lisp' does not exist.\n\nI upgraded to 11.10 from 11.04.\nPlease help me remove this warning.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Synaptic Package manager\n\n*Search for emacs\n\n*Reinstall all packages having emacs in it.\n\n", "Q: Line in only comes out of front speakers and subwoofer on a 5.1 surround system My 5.1 surround sound seems to work just fine except anything I plug in to the line in jack of my sound card only comes out of the the front two speakers and the sub woofer.\nIs there a setting in PulseAudio or Alsamixer that I'm missing?\n\nA: Yes i agree with xjonquilx. \nyour line in is most likely stereo which is different than 5.1, because stereo is analogue and 5.1 is digital.

But in the WoW video configuration it appears as tho it is not detecting the Shader Model 3.0. Basically it says there is none. I am running the game with and without the -opengl parameter with no luck.\nHow can I activate the SM3.0 in Wine since I am using the proprietary Nvidia drivers (290.xx) and have an Nvidia GT440 with 1GB Ram.\nAdditionally today I went to the winecfg and the options for Vertex and Pixel Shading are gone. It only shows the virtual desktop and a couple of other options but no Video configurations.\n\nA: After testing a couple of hours I found the problem. It was the actual game. For example Skyrim was running perfectly, L4D2 was running with full graphics and Hitman also. The only one was WoW. In the config.wtf in the WTF folder of wow I had to change the variable gxApi from OpenGL to d3d11 (Or just basically remove the gxApi line). Also I removed the -opengl parameter from the WoW shortcut.\nThat made the game support SM3.0 as seen in the following pics:\nThis PIC is without OpenGL support (Using DirectX 11 Option):\n\nAs you can see, the only 2 options not available are the Good/Ultra Settings for Liquid Detail and the Sunshafts but this is more of a small part of missing stuff from Wine and a lot of problems with the actual game of WoW. I say this because Skyrim which demands more runs amazingly. The water looks real and reflects.\nWhen I ad the -opengl parameter and edit the Config.wtf leaving OpenGL in the GxApi variable like I mentioned above I get this:\n\n\nAs you can see from the 2 pictures, Multisampling went from 16 to a maximum of 4. Shadow Quality went from Ultra to Fair with a warning saying \"Unsupported for graphics related reasons\". Liquid Detail went to Low as the only option and Ground Clutter went to Low as the only option.\nWine has come a LONG way from the days where newer games could not be played. It is getting to a point that the only reason for some friends to stick with Windows will be gone. There has been good progress towards implementing the Shader Models. Wine has even some support for SM4.0. This link for Wine should help a bit http://wiki.winehq.org/DirectX-Shaders but it is very outdated (2008) and a lot of stuff has happened since then.\nLastly, for running Steam on Linux, if you get a message similar to Required OpenGL extension GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc when running a Steam game, it just means that, either your video card does not support this compression or you are missing installing the correct libraries.

On my laptop I have Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 in dual boot mode.\nI made a partition of 30 GB for Ubuntu but now it's too small and I want to increase this disk size from 32 GB to 100 GB.\nThis is home my disk looks like:\nC Drive - 360 GB\nD Drive - 200 GB\nE Drive - 80 GB\n\nOn the F Drive I installed Ubuntu which contains 30 GB.\nHow can I increase this partition from 30 GB to 100 GB?\nSomeone suggested Gpart tool to achiveve this. but there is a risk to lose my Windows or Ubuntu install.\n\nA: As suggested, you can boot from a live CD or USB into Ubuntu. Then open the application gparted which will already be present and resize partitions. This can however break your bootloader and might require fixing it.\nA better idea is to make a new partition, and move your home directory there so that you have the additional space and Ubuntu partition can be reserved for Ubuntu.\nHere are the steps to do that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a live CD or USB into Ubuntu\n\n*Run gparted to shrink or delete a current windows partition (if you delete E, for example, remember to backup the files in E from inside Windows). Shrinking a partition will not delete any of your files, but backup is a good idea.\n\n*Create a new ext4 partition in the empty space\n\n*Follow this guide to move your home there\nNote:Please don't forget to remove (or comment or edit) old  /dev/sda3 in /etc/fstab. Because multiple declaration of volume (such as  existing /dev/sda3   ntfs    and     /dev/sda3    ext4)  would be crash your ubuntu\n\nA: There are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*As @Uri suggests, boot from Ubuntu Live CD and use gparted to remove/shrink \"E drive\", then move and resize the Ubuntu partition to take the free space. Since Ubuntu partition is the last on the disk, you'll have to move its origin which will break Ubuntu's bootloader - gparted's website contains instructions on how to fix this.\n\n*If you're worried about deleting/moving partitions with gparted, you can just convert one of the partitions (your \"E drive\") to ext4 and either mount it as /home or symlink it instead or somewhere inside your home directory. The 30 gb partition will then be used for system files and the other partition for your documents and stuff.\n\nA: Shutdown your computer, place the Ubuntu CD/USB in it. Then restart your computer and boot from CD/USB and start using Gpart tool.\n\nA: you want to add more space to F Drive, so you can use Disk Management to SHRINK D Drive about 70gb, and EXTEND the 70gb to F Drive.\nAlso, you can use some tools like MiniTool Partition to manage it. First, you can EXTEND D Drive directly to add 70gb to F Drive. OR you can use RESIZE/MOVE function to get unallocated space from E Drive. Next, MERGE F Drive with Unallocated partition.\n\nA: You need to install gparted to use it. For example:\n$ sudo apt install gparted\n\nand then run it as root. For example:\n# gparted\n\nor\n$ sudo gparted\n\nif you have sudo privileges.\n", "Q: Unable to make glib-2.28.0 \nMaking all in gmodule\nmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/ubuntu_abhi/Desktop/C Dependencies/glib-2.28.0/gmodule'\nmake  all-am\n**make[3]: Entering directory `/home/ubuntu_abhi/Desktop/C Dependencies/glib-2.28.0/gmodule'\n  CC     gmodule.lo\n  CCLD   libgmodule-2.0.la\n/bin/sed: can't read Dependencies/glib-2.28.0/glib/libglib-2.0.la: No such file or directory\nlibtool: link: `Dependencies/glib-2.28.0/glib/libglib-2.0.la' is not a valid libtool archive\nmake[3]: *** [libgmodule-2.0.la] Error 1\nmake[3]: Leaving directory `/home/ubuntu_abhi/Desktop/C Dependencies/glib-2.28.0/gmodule'\nmake[2]: *** [all] Error 2\nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/ubuntu_abhi/Desktop/C Dependencies/glib-2.28.0/gmodule'\nmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/ubuntu_abhi/Desktop/C Dependencies/glib-2.28.0'\nmake: *** [all] Error 2**\n\n\nA: libtool does not handle directory names with spaces very well.

There are also problems with playing internet streams, though that might be a different issue.\nIf that weren't enough, videos in YouTube are slow to start, and it takes a good ten to thirty seconds for the sound and video to sync up.\nSo, either I'm just having a world of bad luck with a whole bunch of disparate problems.\nOr, I thought, maybe since they are all connected to sound in some way, maybe there is a root problem with my sound set up and all the problems I'm seeing are symptoms.\nMy suspicion is that this is a gstreamer issue because so far as I can tell VLC has no such problems playing audio streams. (I wish VLC had an interface that would allow me to edit and sort playlists...)\nIs there any way I might diagnose this problem?\nOr do I just have to live with the fact that sound drivers and audio programs on Ubuntu are flakey?\n\nA: I'm not sure exactly how to fix the problem(s), but since you asked for ways to diagnose the problem, some of the following suggestions might be useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are all gstreamer players broken?\nTest out Clementine, Banshee, Rhythmbox, and Totem. Can you play the files in some media players, but not others?  Does seeking work with some of those players but not others? Since all of those players are based on gstreamer, they should behave pretty similarly. If they don't, you're probably looking at a bug in a particular media player.\n\n*What about non-gstreamer media players?\nIf the problems seem to affect all of the gstreamer players you try, it will be good to know if you can play and seek in the files using other media players such as VLC or mplayer.\n\n*Need some extra plugins?\nIf the problem seems to be limited to gstreamer, you'll want to check your gstreamer plugins. Depending on the type of file you're trying to play, you may need to install gstreamer0.1-plugin-ugly. It's important to note that the -ffmpeg plugin allows for playback but not seeking in mp3 files.\n\n*Or should we blame PulseAudio?\nThe bullet points above may help you narrow down the problem, but in all honesty, I'll be surprised if they fix things. Youtube playback should have very little to do with gstreamer, and much more to do with Flash's interaction with PulseAudio. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about PulseAudio to be of much use. :(\n\nA: First off, make sure you have your system updated.\n  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf you have already made sure you have installed the ubuntu sound codecs that are needed to play some formats not there in the default install. This can be done through typing \nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse\n\nYou can attempt to restart alsa.  A guide explaining how to attempt to do this is avaible here If these do not work, I would recomend installing the Ubuntu Audio team's ppa to troubleshot sound issues by giving you more \"bleeding edge\" sound drivers. The instructions are avaible here and the page also contains information on other ways of getting sound information sorted out.\n", "Q: What's the easiest way to configure GRUB in a more user friendly way?

If we don't store your credentials somewhere, then we would have to ask you for your Ubuntu One password on every login.\nIf we store the credentials in a safe place, like we do now with the Keyring, then the Keyring will ask you for its password when you login.\nThe only \"solutions\" for this are:\n1) You make the keyring less secure and it doesn't ask for a password on login.\n2) Ubuntu One stores the credentials insecurely (outside of the keyring) like some other\n   applications do. \nBoth are a security risk, since anyone with physical access to your device can grab your credentials.\nIn my opinion, what we have now is as good a solution as it's possible to have.\n", "Q: SSH graphical session without graphical environment installed on server I am quite a noob in network/server stuff and I don't really know where to begin.

All user data is on Win ntfs partitions. There are other Windows machines in the same workgroup and both the SAMBA and Windows workgroups have the same name [and are so configured in the smb.conf file].\nSAMBA has a nice GUI for server configuration, however there is no simple point and click option to have SAMBA automatically mount a device or a share [such as a local windows partition on this dual boot installation] on boot and login. In fact, to configure the share in SAMBA, it must be mounted manually in Nautilus. There is no issue getting pysdm to mount a device on login [although pysdm crashes on 11.10] - or going through the pain of gksudo gedit /etc/fstab. \nThe point is getting SAMBA to mount the device and browse it as part of the network. SAMBA can open and browse other machines in the workgroup, but devices on the local machine cannot be browsed as part of the workgroup, even when the device is mounted locally. The device/share can only be browsed locally as a mounted local device, and attempting to browse as part of the network gets an \"unable to mount location - failed to mount Windows share\" error. SAMBA sees the machine name and the shares within, but trying to browse gets the above error.\nTo allow [local] access to the device requires a manual single click in Nautilus to mount the device(s) in question. Seems reasonable, that if the device is mounted and can be accessed by the user locally, SAMBA should be able to browse the share as part of the network [workgroup], however, that is not the case. Even if the local share was the only member of the workgroup, seems it should be browsable as a network device.\nIs there a simple [aka gui] way to get SAMBA to mount the device and browse it as part of the workgroup [and why is that not offered in the SAMBA server configuration]?\n\nA: Samba does not mount anything. That is the job of the OS. Once a filesystem is mounted, samba can expose any part of that filesystem as a share to your network using the SMB (CIFS) protocol.\nI think what you need to do is mount your windows partition, then edit your smb.conf to share out whatever part of the folder tree you need.\nTo get the list of partitions on your local disk, use the fdisk command:\nubuntu@sid:/etc$ sudo fdisk -l\n[sudo] password for ubuntu: \n\nDisk /dev/sda: 10.2 GB, 10202050560 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1240 cylinders, total 19925880 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000d0afb\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048      499711      248832   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2          501758    19924991     9711617    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5          501760    19924991     9711616   8e  Linux LVM\n\nNow you can see what filesystems are on which devices. You'll be looking for something that says FAT32 or NTFS in the right hand column. Now you just need to mount that particular device on a mountpoint in your filesystem. This requires that you create a folder that you want mount the filesystem into.\nmount -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222 /dev/sda3 /mnt/winlocal\n\nThe command above is just an example... You'll need to modify for you environment.\nOnce this is working, you can create an entry in your fstab file to do this at boot.\n", "Q: Additional Language in KDE I just installed KDE desktop environment and I want to install an additional language (Urdu) in unity 2d I was using it butt in KDE Its seems very difficult.

Remapping Alt key to behave as another Ctrl key is not a solution because you lose the Alt key functionalities (some of which are essential, like Alt+Tab).\nSo how can I get a behavior similar to MacOS where cmd key is used for keyboard shortcuts (but also for switching between windows with cmd+Tab)?\nI know I can assign Ctrl+Tab to switch between windows after I remap Alt key as a Ctrl key. But then I lose the real Ctrl+Tab functionality in some applications, which are also critical like switching tabs in Chrome. Basically my Ctrl and Alt keys would become the same key and it will be impossible to have two different set of shortcuts for these two modifier keys.\nA good solution for me would probably be a way to catch Alt+C, Alt+V, Alt+X, etc. at the window management level and send instead a Ctrl+C or Ctrl+V or Ctrl+X etc. to the focused window. On Windows this was possible via AutoHotKey. On Linux, I heard about an application called AutoKey but unlike AutoHotKey you have to use a GUI to set the shortcuts. Since I will be writing almost all combinations of Alt manually, I don't want a GUI application do to this.

When I'm getting here:\n\nThe installer won't let me install because it doesn't determine the D: partition. It  complains that there is not enough space on the C: partition.\nHow can I tell the installer to install on D:?\n\nA: As pointed out, that part of the installer does not detect partitions.\nAlso, if you are going to install Ubuntu onto an empty partition, it is best to leave it unformatted, so that when the installer looks for free space, it will prefer the empty partition, instead of reporting all partitions as in use.\nYou can delete the \"D:\" partition from the Windows Disk Manager.\n\nA: When you go on, you'll soon get to a screen that allows you to determine the partition where you'd like to install Ubuntu.  It won't be called \"C:\" or \"D:\", but probably something like sdaX, where \"X\" is a number.  If you have several partitions, it could be any number.  Look for the partition (e.g. sda5) which is the size of what you think of as your \"D:\" partition; that's the one you want (as long as you don't have more than one partition of the same size!).  Choose that one for the installation, and probably \"/\" for the mount point.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 x64 is not loading after a hard reset.

This looks like a nice printer I came across at a local store. Its the \"Kodak 7.1 Hero\". I cannot seem to find if this will work on Ubuntu and if drivers are easily obtainable? The official site only says \"windows & mac\", but I have seen a YouTube video showing the google cloud printing feature working in Ubuntu. The video was in German so I couldnt make sense of it. Ive also check the open printers website and no info there.\nAny help would be appreciated!

Is there a clean way to save a general configuration of the system and then to come back to this one if I did some mistakes?\nHow can I reinstall my ubuntu without loosing my emails (thunderbird) and my documents? Any suggestion will be accepted.\n\nA: Concerning your thunderbird question: all your mails and mailing settings are stored in your homefolder in ~/.thunderbird (that's /home/$YOURUSERNAME/.thunderbird). Just backup this folder and paste it in the same direction on a clean install and you are able to continue with Thunderbird, where you left.\nThe dot in the folder-name indicates that the folder is hidden. You therefore normally won't see this folder. To display hidden folders, you may press [CTRL]+[H] in nautilus.\nFor your documents you would logically backup your Documents folder in your home-directory (however it is on your system called as it is localized).\nAnd to installation faults: I don't know if there is something like a snapshot possibility but if you have installed a wrong package or such and don't see a thing, you may want to remember that you are using a Linux system. Press [CTRL]+[ALT]+[F1] to enter your first tty. This will work no matter if your xserver is acting faulty or not. From there you can revert any changes you made like you would do it in the terminal.\n", "Q: Juju SSH setup in orchestra environment For orchestra, must the public keys be copied to the nodes before 'juju bootstrap' is run for the first time?\n\nA: David, the nodes don't exist before bootstrap is run. Orchestra configures cobbler to install the nodes from scratch, and then start juju. This is done so that juju charms that are deployed can start with a base, clean system. Its been discussed that we may want to make it easier to take control of an existing machine with juju, but right now that is not how it works.\njuju bootstrap basically does this with orchestra:\n\n\n*\n\n*Talks to cobbler via the XML-RPC API, finds a system marked for PXE boot that is in the 'available-mgmt-class', injects data to install juju on first boot, and moves it to the 'acquired-mgmt-class'. It then uses the power infastructure, if defined, to turn the machine on. This machine will be the \"bootstrap node\" which runs zookeeper and the provisioning agent. Included in the \"first boot\" seed data is the user's SSH public key to install to the 'ubuntu' user so that the juju clients can talk to the bootstrap node over an ssh tunnel.\n\n*Stores an object in the file storage (usually an ssl webdav service on orchestra-provisioning-server) that informs future juju clients that the environment is bootstrapped, and how to contact the bootstrap node.\n\n\nNote that you can override the ssh authorized keys path to use. It will normally use ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub. You can also set it with 'authorized-keys-path' in environments.yaml. You can also insert actual keys to override all of that with 'authorized-keys'.\n", "Q: MySQL 5.5 starts and then instantly stops MySQL 5.5 on Ubuntu 10.10 used to work well until yesterday but today whenever I start MySQL using mysqld_safe as root user it shows\nStarting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql\n\nand then shows pid ended\nI haven't run any updates recently but I used the MySQL administrator to connect to a remote database but MySQL administrator was installed one month ago.\nI then examined the error file error.log and found this:\n120210 02:33:23 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql\n120210  2:33:23 [Warning] Ignoring user change to '=root' because the user was set to 'mysql' earlier on the command line\n\n120210  2:33:23 [ERROR] Can't find messagefile '/usr/share/errmsg.sys'\n120210  2:33:23 InnoDB: The InnoDB memory heap is disabled\n120210  2:33:23 InnoDB: Mutexes and rw_locks use GCC atomic builtins\n120210  2:33:23 InnoDB: Compressed tables use zlib 1.2.5\n120210  2:33:23 InnoDB: Using Linux native AIO\n120210  2:33:23 InnoDB: Initializing buffer pool, size = 128.0M\n120210  2:33:23 InnoDB: Completed initialization of buffer pool\n120210  2:33:23 InnoDB: highest supported file format is Barracuda.\n120210  2:33:24  InnoDB: Waiting for the background threads to start\n120210  2:33:25 InnoDB: 1.1.8 started; log sequence number 1595675\n120210  2:33:25 [ERROR] Aborting\n\n120210  2:33:25  InnoDB: Starting shutdown...\n120210  2:33:26  InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 1595675\n120210  2:33:26 [Note]\n120210 02:33:26 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /var/lib/mysql/lovesh-Inspiron-N4050.pid ended\n\nEDIT:\nas asked by Huckle the ps -aux goes like this\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nroot         1  0.0  0.0   2884  1740 ?

Check to see if the file is there.\nCheck to see if the file /usr/local/mysql/share/english/errmsg.sys exists and then:\ncp /usr/local/mysql/share/english/errmsg.sys /usr/share/errmsg.sys\n\nMake sure the new /usr/share/errmsg.sys file has permissions for MySQL to access it and try restarting.\nFrom the link above, it seems this just happened when the user restarted the machine. If your machine was rebooted, it might for some reason have deleted the file. Why would it do that? I have no idea, unfortunately.\n\nA: Better not copy files to the fallback directory. Instead, either specify the parameter in the command line, or add the following to my.ini / my.cnf:\n[mysqld]\nlc_messages_dir = /usr/local/mysql/share\n\nMore details here.\n\nA: I had exactly this same problem in Debian 7.0 - Wheezy.\nUpon MySql start, the system was trowing the error:\n[ERROR] Can't find messagefile '/usr/share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys'\n\nI did some investigating based on this post, and found out the file /usr/share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys was missing.\nFor me it was enough to install:\napt-get install --reinstall mysql-server-core-5.5\n\n\nA: I'm cross copying this post from superuser, it basically fixes your problem.\nI used The following guide to install 5.5 on Ubuntu 11.04: http://www.ovaistariq.net/490/a-step-by-step-guide-to-upgrading-to-mysql-5-5/\nEverything worked perfectly except one of the final steps, launching mysql:\nmysqld --skip-grant-tables --user=mysql\n\nWas giving me the following message and then shutting down:\n[ERROR] Can't find messagefile '/usr/share/errmsg.sys'\n\nAfter some googling I found the solution to be adding the following flag:\n--lc-messages-dir=\"/usr/local/mysql/share/english/\"\n\nTo launch it and have it actually work, I used the following command:\n mysqld --skip-grant-tables --user=mysql --lc-messages-dir=\"/usr/local/mysql/share/english/\"\n\nMySQL 5.5 has some great new features that solved a partitioning issue for me; partitioning via a varchar.\nGood luck!\n\nA: MySQL isn't setting its error message language to English automatically.  I have yet to figure out why this happens, but the solution is to pass --lc-messages=english (formerly --language) on the command line or add language=english to the configuration file.\nThe file specified in the error message should not exist: MySQL shouldn't be looking there.  If you copy a locale file to that location, you're not fixing the real problem; you're just asking for trouble down the road.\n", "Q: Why is network-manager adding 10 more seconds to shutdown time? Without network-manager installed, my system shuts down in 2 or 3 seconds.\nWhy does it take almost 15 seconds (which is a 5-time increase) with network-manager installed and can't this time be shortened?\n\nA: Because it's bugged & has been for a while now\nMain bug with possible self fix\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/869635\nDup bug with alternate self fix\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netbase/+bug/903825\nThis has worked fine here though I'd suggest you read both reports 1st\nsudo mv /etc/rc6.d/S35networking /etc/rc6.d/S15networking\n\nsudo mv /etc/rc0.d/S35networking /etc/rc0.d/S15networking\n\nOr simply wait out a fix if one does show someday.

Now it is supposed to be doing the partitioning and it has been about an hour.\nIs it safe to restart the PC now? I want to get back to my data on windows.\n\nA: DO NOT RESTART!  You will likely regret it if you do!  Repartitioning an NTFS partition takes a lot of time, and once it starts you just need to let it go to completion.\nHaving said that, depending on what you're doing with that partition, you could end up with trouble afterwards.  If you are simply reducing the size of the partition by taking away some of the space at the end, you should be fine; I've done that many times without problems.  \nHowever, if you are resizing AND moving the Windows partition, you might be in for trouble.  Windows doesn't like that, and often rewards those who attempt it with the inability to boot into Windows, sometimes permanently.  I did it once, and recovery meant booting into Ubuntu, accessing the Windows partition to rescue everything of value, then reformatting the partition and getting rid of Windows entirely.  (By the way, it worked out: I've never reinstalled Windows on that machine and I've never missed it.)\nThe safest way to reduce the size of a Windows partition is from within Windows itself.  Once you have repartitioned and cleared out the space for a new OS, then is the time to boot into the Ubuntu (or other Linux) LiveDisk and install.\n", "Q: Scripts for hybrid graphics discreete card disable on startup A lot of time ago I've used a simple script in /etc/rc.local to disable discrete graphics during bootup.\nBut now it's not allowed to do anything with /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch when you not logged in as root (I can use it only after \"sudo su\"), so the script can not do anything.\nAny ideas how to escalate privileges or simply how to make it work?\nThanx in advance.\n\nA: I'm using\nchmod -R 705 /sys/kernel/debug\nchown -R $YOURUSERNAME:$YOURUSERNAME /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nin my rc.local and it works often for me (not always though).\n", "Q: Problem installing Ubuntu in my new computer I have a new computer with an Nvidia graphics card and I'm trying to install Ubuntu.

Here are two (non-officialy supported by Kingston) methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a windows virtual machine to un-lock the drive, and then releasing it to the host OS. It works for me with VMware Workstation.\n\n*Using the binaries shipped with another Kingston key, namely the \"DataTraveler Vault Privacy 3.0\". (Works under both x86 and x64 linux system.) Obviously, you would need to carry the binaries on another drive (unless you are able to edit the read-only zone of the stick).\n\n\nA: Sadly, it isn't possible to get this device working under Linux. Without the right method to decrypt, which they keep secret, there's no use really.\nFormatting the drive won't do anything either, as it doesn't present itself like that to the OS.\nI've got one of them here and its just simply useless to Linux.\n\nA: @duffydack Unfortunately, that won't work. The drive is set up with 2 partitions - a public partition and a private partition. The public partition contains an app that is used to access the private partition.\nThere is extra hardware in the memory stick that is used to access the private partition. The private partition is not a normal USB drive partition and can only be accessed using the proprietary hardware and the app on the public partition.\nNot even GParted can see the private partition. It must be accessed via the app, which of course won't run under Linux.\n\nA: Personally I would wipe the stick and format with encryption.  Install the cryptsetup package.  \nsudo apt-get install cryptsetup \nand if not already installed, the Disk Utility app.  \nsudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility \nThen use the disk utility to format to your desired filesystem type and enable encryption, like so.\n\n", "Q: Some devices don't work on 3.0 USB port? My laptop a HP DV6-1149wm has 2x 3.0 USB, and 2x 2.0 USB ports.\nSome devices will work fine on both, like flash drives, but some other devices, like my iPod, and my Android phone will not work on my 3.0 ports.  They just don't show up at all, lsusb shows nothing, nor syslog.  \nAny idea why it is device-specific?  Or is there any way to force my 3.0 ports to act as 2.0 for the time being? I don't have any 3.0 devices.\n\nA: You didn't say which version of Ubuntu you are using. USB 3.0 is problematic (buggy) in all versions prior to 12.04 in my personal experience. \nYour best options may be to upgrade to 12.04 (or upgrade your kernel to at least 3.2).\n\nA: Also, your drivers could not be fully functioning yet. There is a reason you're not supposed to use USB3 for important installs yet.\n", "Q: Can I use GNOME2 themes in GNOME3? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhere can I get themes and eye-candy for my desktop? \n\nI have been using Ubuntu for years. I love it and am a big fan of gnome 2x and gtk 2x.\nI have lots of themes installed which worked on those former versions. However, since the implementation of GNOME3 and GTK3 the old gtk/gnome style themes no longer work.\nI went to usr/share/themes and noticed that there are major differences in the ways themes are handled. To see the difference you just need look at the Radiance theme and see the difference between the two schemes.\nSince there is such a difference, will there be a tool to convert old themes to the new standard or are there more themes on their way? \n\nA: A few links for Unity themes:\nSeveral themes (11.04 but most should support 11.10)\nElementary, Orta, Minty Freshness\nOngoing work on a very customizable theme\n", "Q: List samba shares and current users Looking for a simple way to do this from the command line.\nList samba shares and the users who can access each of them.\nList samba shares and the users currently connected to them.\nList samba shares and every connection (log, including user) that has been established to each of them.\nAny ideas?

You can use the same keyboard and mouse for each.\nIf you use arrow keys to control your mouse pointer, that shouldn't be a problem for Synergy.\nHowever, Synergy will only work on machines that have desktop interfaces running.\nIf a server system has a mouse pointer (even from an attached mouse) but it has no GUI running, Synergy will not work. (And it wouldn't make sense for it to work. If you want a console to operate seamlessly as part of a single GUI, just SSH in to the server from the desktop machine.)\nWeb searches for synergy \"command-line only\" and similar strings return results because the Synergy client executable (for some OSes) is a command-line-only executable--that is, it doesn't have its own GUI.\nTo verify to a reasonable degree of sureness that Synergy requires a GUI to be running, I consulted its source code. In this file, you can see that a host's operating system determines if the CScreen object is instantiated from the CMSWindowsScreen, CXWindowsScreen, or COSXScreen subclases. X Windows is the GUI in most Unix-like systems, including all GNU/Linux systems (which includes Ubuntu). You may have heard of it referred to as X11 (which is the most common of its several names).\nWhile that doesn't rigorously prove that a Synergy screen on an Ubuntu machine needs to have a GUI running, it constitutes significant confirming evidence to an otherwise consistent understanding of what Synergy does and does not do, which I believe to be cogent.\nA Server Can Have a GUI\nI said Synergy won't work if a GUI isn't running. But an Ubuntu Server system can run a GUI:\n\n*\n\n*How do you run Ubuntu Server with a GUI?\n\n*ServerGUI (Ubuntu wiki)\nOn the other hand there are some good reasons to avoid installing and using a GUI on a production server system (see also this part of the ServerGUI page).\nIf your Ubuntu Server system has a GUI running, Synergy should work fine. (Similarly, if you have an Ubuntu desktop system with no GUI--equally possible--Synergy will not work.)\n", "Q: How to export to AAC audio from Audacity? Exporting to MP3 audio from Audacity works fine, but exporting to \"M4A (AAC)\" results in nothing. No file is created or whatsoever.\nI can see that it depends on \"ffmpeg\" library to work, but the application WinFF (which also makes use of this library) is working fine to me. Do I need to install anything else?\n\nA: This seems to be a known issue between ffmpeg and Audacity 1.3.x\nRead more about it here.\nMy guess is that the Ubuntu packagers decided not to compile Audacity with support for the ffmpeg libraries because of these issues. I don't know what versions are in the official repo, as I'm using the Getdeb.net ones. I can confirm that what you said does not work for me either, but it applies to all ffmpeg exports.\n", "Q: How do I update to Python 2.7?

How can I turn that mail into something useful, i.e. something I can search and browse easily and fast (i.e. grep takes far to long). I have no need for a full mail client, just the archive management part of it.\n\nA: You might find the Notmuch mail indexer library.  It is designed so that it can be used as a backing store for some mail client, but can also be used as independent mail index.\nIt maintains a Xapian full text index of your mail, so search queries should be a lot more efficient than grep once you have all the messages imported.\n", "Q: Un bootstrapping a juju/orchestra environment I think my juju environment in my orchestra server is broken, and I want to do the bootstrap process again.\nBasically, I'd like to run:\njuju bootstrap\n\nand not get:\n2012-02-09 19:51:48,503 INFO juju environment previously bootstrapped.\n\nHow can I reset things, and re-bootstrap?\nI also noticed that juju installed the zookeeper on node1 of my environment.

If I try and enable both monitors with a mirrored display again (using a resolution of 1680x1050), I get a dialog box showing with the error \"could not assign CRTCs to outputs\".\nIf I try and enable the Samsung monitor and use and extended desktop across the two displays, the Samsung monitor wakes up and I can drag windows over to it, but it shows nothing on the screen. \nWhen the computer boots, both monitors show the same content at the EFI screen and at the GRUB screen. Both monitors show a light purple background while Ubuntu loads. I only seem to have a problem with the second monitor after I get to the desktop screen. Additionally, if I boot into Windows, both monitors work with an extended desktop without any problem.\nHopefully someone can shed some light on this issue. I thought I better post here before reporting a bug against xserver-xorg-video-intel. Thanks! :)\n\nA: Answer: Yes, it's supported, but as James Henstridge pointed out, there is a bug in the driver when the HDMI port is used. Use the VGA + DVI ports for two monitors as a workaround until the bug gets fixed.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu and grub on new hdd I just aquired a new hdd to my windows 7 system and want to install ubuntu 11.10 and grub on it. I have a liveCD but cant make it work. When i chose the new hdd for installation (sdc1) it says \"No root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu.\" What should i do to make it work_ this is the first time i try to install ubuntu so i have no previous experience of it. \n\nA: That message basically means that you have not set up the partition to mount the root (i.e. \"/\"). Please boot from the CD and start installation; assuming the new hard disk, sdc1 is empty, do the following.\n1) Choose the option to set up the partition system manually\n2) Create your first partition, set the partition type to swap (this will be the swap partition, something like windows page file, you won't see or deal with this partition again but it is necessary for good performance), specify the size (I usually use 4 GB) and create it.\n3) Create another partition of type \"ext4\" (or any other llinux filesystem you wish) and set the size for this one. Where it says to select the mount point, select /\n4) (optional) I usually create a separate partition for /home where my files are kept, it is usually a good idea in case you want to do a clean install of ubuntu in future, your data will be on a separate partition. Just create a partition of the desired size and type ext4 and mount point /home\nNow install in the partition mounted at / and life is good :)\n\nA: The easiest option would be to temporarily unplug the Windows drive, start the installation and then allow Ubuntu \"to use the whole drive\" or something along those lines - which I believe would be the default option. This, however, would not add Windows to your GRUB boot menu not will it try to migrate your documents and settings from Windows (it.s been a while since I dual-booted with Windows so I may remember this part wrong). You'll be able to add Windows to the GRUB menu manually later or just change boot priority in BIOS setup.\nAnother option is to partition the drive during the setup manually, which is not difficult at all but is slightly more dangerous than installing with Windows drive unplugged. At the very least, you'll need to create one large ext4 partition for your root filesystem (setting its mount point to /) and another small partition for swap (roughly the size of your RAM). \n", "Q: whats the difference between DocumentRoot and Directory Plaese till me what is the difference between DocumentRoot and Directory in default file\ndefault file in apache2 has three blocks\nDocumentRoot /var/www   in me server /sda1/htdocs\n\n<Directory />\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n</Directory>\n\n<Directory /var/www>   in my server sda1/htdocs>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n    AllowOverride None\n    Order allow,deny\n    allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nMay I use just these two in sda1/htdocs directory\nDocumentRoot /sda1/htdocs\n\n<Directory /sda1/htdocs>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n    AllowOverride None\n    Order allow,deny\n    allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nWith many Thanks\n\nA: Here's an excerpt from the official Apache documentation:\n\nIf multiple (non-regular expression) Directory sections match the\n  directory (or one of its parents) containing a document, then the\n  directives are applied in the order of shortest match first,\n  interspersed with the directives from the .htaccess files. For\n  example, with\n<Directory /> AllowOverride None </Directory>\n\n<Directory /home> AllowOverride FileInfo </Directory>\n\nfor access to the document /home/web/dir/doc.html the steps are:\nApply directive AllowOverride None (disabling .htaccess files).\nApply directive AllowOverride FileInfo (for directory /home).\nApply any FileInfo directives in /home/.htaccess, /home/web/.htaccess and /home/web/dir/.htaccess in that order.\n\n\nI.e. Directory / directive defines \"defaults\" for all other directories, which can be overridden by each particular directory\nIn your case both of the versions you're showing should be equivalent unless you have other Directory directives.\n", "Q: How can I use transmission-daemon with a download folder on a ntfs file system? I have a small partition for linux and a big partition that is ntfs so I can share files with my windows installation.\nI want to use transmission-daemon (this is a console-only installation) and I want it to download in the ntfs partition.\nThe problem is that transmission reports \"Permission Denied\" when trying to save the downloaded torrents. I assume this is because all permissions on ntfs are rwXwrX--- (which means no access for other users, and transmission-daemon is other user). The worst part is that I cannot chmod o+rwX /media/ntfspartition/torrents/ -- it just doesn't work, it's ntfs.\nIn this particular case neither can i use transmission-gtk\nSo, how can I make transmission-daemon download to a ntfs folder?\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: I simply noticed that NTFS partitions are mounted as root:plugdev, so I simply did:\nusermod -g plugdev debian-transmission\n\nI added debian-transmission user to plugdev group and now no problem!\n\nA: Well, looking at the script that is put in /etc/init.d/transmission-daemon, the user name we want to ensure has the proper permissions is called debian-transmission. Given that NTFS does not support Linux permissions, we have to mount the NTFS partition in a way that will let debian-transmission write to it.\nWe want to add debian-transmission to a certain group (one where you are also a member, obviously) and let that group have write access to the partition.\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a group, say ntfs-users.\n\n*Add yourself to the group.\n\n*Add debian-transmission to the group.\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab as per detailed instructions here.\n\n*You need to log out and in again to have the new group membership, as does debian-transmission (restart service), and the partition has to be unmounted and mounted again. Either do all of those manually, or just restart your system if that is an option.\n\n\nFrom how you phrased your question, it seems that you are proficient with Linux, so I will assume that you can either carry out those steps without further instruction or find out how with ease. Best of luck. :-)\n", "Q: nodejs npm installation error I am doing this with root privileges.

I tried to plug in my external hard disk on Ubuntu. I copied in to it some folders (created on Ubuntu) with files in them. \nThen, I plugged it on Windows and I wasn't able to copy or modify any of the copies folders or sub-folders. I could access my files (and modify them), but I couldn't modify or copy any of the folders or sub-folders.\nI tried formatting my computer's and the external hard disk, that did not make a difference.\nWhat should I do?\nwimvds --> Thanks for your answer, first of all :) Yes! I did. I always use \"Unmount\" on linux as well as on windows...\nMisery --> No errors are promoted during the copy process. What do you mean by saying \"attributions\"?? :/\n\nA: As others have said this is file permissions.\nUse Microsoft's \"xcacls\" (a downloadable tool by Microsoft for Windows sysadmins) because I believe it's a Windows issue. I used to see this on Windows Servers sometimes when the ACL (Access Control List) is borked. \nTake ownership of everything (important) and then assign 'full control' access level.\nYou shouldn't have to do it each time.\n\nA: What types of files are you trying to access from the windows machine? Have you tried copying those files using the windows cmd window? Try using chmod -r 777  on the folder in the hard drive. Also, have you tried zipping the folder on Ubuntu, then copying that file over to the external HDD? Also, have you done anything to the external HDD since you bought it? Maybe it has some type of copy protection mechanism.\n\nA: Ok, This most likely was your problem. When the USB was created it was made to only be compatible with Ubuntu (ext 2, ext 4, or encrypted). What you need to to to fix this problem is format the USB as 'FAT' compatible with all systems. This should solve you problem.   I had this very dame problem.\n\nA: It sounds like the NTFS read-only attribute has been set.  Check in Windows that the files do not have the read-only attribute set.

Just plug it in and go. It is also wireless , but I didn't try it in that mode.\n\nA: In general Linux does not require specific drivers for printing. CUPS will handle this for you. The generel rule applies here: stick with compatible hardware and you will have a hassle free usage.\nRegarding specifically printers:\nHave a look at the Ubuntu wiki page on printers. Notable excerpt:\n\nManufacturer-Specific Installation\nMany of these printer manufacturers require non-free drivers or plug-ins. HP has the largest selection of free software compatible printers. Some of the higher end laser machines from other manufacturers are at least partially free software compatible.\n\nAnd the wiki has a link to a site that sells Linux compatible hardware\n\n*\n\n*https://www.thinkpenguin.com/catalog/printer-all-one\nI do not think you will go wrong when you choose any of the other printers listed on these 2 sites or even if you just buy a random HP printer.\n\nA: hp is the best Linux Imaging and Printing\nHPLIP is an HP developed solution for printing, scanning, and faxing with HP inkjet and laser based printers in Linux.\nThe HPLIP project provides printing support for over 2,080 printer models--including; Deskjet, Officejet, Photosmart, PSC (Print, Scan, Copy), Business Inkjet, LaserJet, Edgeline MFP, and LaserJet MFP.\nHP Linux Imaging and Printing\n\nA: Good advice from Rinzwind.  \nIf you're willing to spend a little extra, I got a CanonMG5220 color, all-in-one printer that I'd recommend.

I thought I already had the time up there in the top bar, and it may have been so in previous Ubuntu versions (don't remember, my Ubuntu laptop is just one of three computers I use). Only that I just noticed - me being someone who never wears a watch, has the cellphone turned off 95% of the time and relying on the computer to tell the time - that there is no time being displayed anywhere, and I had expected it in the top bar on the Unity desktop.\nI searched around but found no obvious solution, but I'm sure someone immediately knows how I can get my time (back?) into the top bar?\n\nA: The time is shown by default, so it looks like you've changed something to make it disappear.\nDo you still see the date? Right-click the date, select \"Time & Date Settings\", go to the \"Clock\" tabsheet, make sure that \"Show a clock in the menu bar\" is checked.\nIf you don't see the date, go to System Settings, where you'll also find the \"Time & Date\" settings.\n\nThere is no longer a \"Time & Date\" setting in System Setting - Ubuntu 12.10 - but this link describes how to enable these on the display:\n(note: dconf-editor is already installed by default)\nHow to make the date appear next to the time indicator in Gnome Classic?\n\nA: If after installing the app and correcting config, the date&time are \"greyed-out\", then it means your chosen region is not matched to your local server.\nTo correct:  \n1/ set the time&date to your actual region (eg China) \n2/ use synaptic to select the repository server for your actual region (eg China).\n3/ reboot.\nThis should solve the issue.

How can tell that my last shutdown was properly done in Ubuntu 11.10 or if the machine was powered off before shutting down the OS?\n\nA: I use the last command.  It lists reboots and crashes.\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 16.04, a clean shutdown followed by a proper reboot will write these 2 lines one after the other in /var/log/syslog \nMar  9 14:14:06 *YOUR-HOSTNAME* rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"8.16.0\" x-pid=\"1086\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] exiting on signal 15.\nMar  9 15:23:42 *YOUR-HOSTNAME* rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"8.16.0\" x-pid=\"1069\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] start\n\n\nA: If the machine was shutdown properly then there must be a  shutdown log logged in kern.log file in /var/log  directory. After a shutdown whenever a normal boot occurs the OS writes the  log for the same in kern.log. Hence every boot log must be preceded by a shutdown log if the booting and shutdown process was normal. \nWhenever a normal shutdown occurs \"Kernel logging (proc) stopped.\" is written in kern.log.\nSimilarly whenever a boot occurs \"imklog 5.8.1, log source = /proc/kmsg started.\" is written in kern.log\nThese two messages should be in the order if the shutdown was normal rather than abrupt power off.

Unfortunately, I don't see a way to do it without installing openjdk.\nHow can I install tomcat6 from repository in this configuration, or tell Ubuntu that I already have Java and I'm happy with it thank you very much? Do I have to install tomcat (and all other Java-dependent packages) by downloading them from their respective websites, unpacking and adding links myself?\n\nA: Since tomcat6 depends on openjdk-6-jre, when you install tomcat6, you will also install openjdk. Afterwards, you can choose to either remove or keep it, but to make sure that tomcat6 uses Oracle JAVA, you just need to:\nsudo vi /etc/default/tomcat6\nand set JAVA_HOME:\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle\nIf you want to keep both Oracle an OpenJDK, you can check How do I install Oracle Java JDK 7? to create the /usr/lib/jvm/.java-7-oracle.jinfo file required by update-java-alternatives. Then, switch between them with:\nsudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-openjdk\nsudo update-java-alternatives -s java-7-oracle\n\n", "Q: What triggers file system check? What are the conditions that trigger file system check at system startup in Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: There's a few conditions which will trigger a fsck when a filesystem is mounted.\nFirstly the maximum mount count, and the check interval. To see these, try:\nsudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda1\n\nReplace sda1 with the filesystem you want to check.\nYou're looking for:\nMount count:              9\nMaximum mount count:      29\nLast checked:             Tue Nov 15 17:15:10 2011\nCheck interval:           15552000 (6 months)\nNext check after:         Sun May 13 18:15:10 2012\n\nHere you can see my drive has been mounted 9 times since it was last checked, and it will force a check after 29 mounts just to make sure everything is still okay. It will also do one after 6 months even if the maximum mount count hasn't been reached. (these values are also tweakable with tune2fs).\nSecondly, if the filesystem is not cleanly unmounted, the next mount attempt will trigger a fsck. This is also in the tune2fs output, look for:\nFilesystem state:         clean\n\n", "Q: Language Support does not run (crashes) in 10.04 In Lucid 10.04, while trying to get spell-checking running in OpenOffice, I discovered taht I cannot open my Language Support dialog.  \n\n\n*\n\n*System -> Administration -> Language Support \n\n\nIt flashes up on the screen, shows a progress bar, and immediately disappears as the progress bar gets to the end... \nI've uninstalled and re-insatalled language-selector-common language-selector ubuntu-standard, but it hasn't made any difference.  \nHere is the stderr output, from running /usr/bin/gnome-language-selector in the terminal.

Locales tend to look like en_US.UTF-8, so that's why splitting them up on \"_\" is a good idea: one says it's English, the other part says it's specifically US English.\nPerhaps you have locales that don't follow this format installed (unlikely, but possible?)?\n", "Q: What is the easiest, most effective backup system for Ubuntu Servers? I'm trying to backup my /var/www/ folder, MySQL, and any other special documents like in the /etc/apache2/ folder.\nDoes anyone have any solutions for backup software? Maybe something that's Cronjob-able?\n\nA: The best backup solution is highly dependent on your requirements. It's best to start with a backup strategy and let your strategy inform your choice of software. At minimum, you'll want to read enough to know the difference between the common backup types (incremental, differential, full).\nIf incremental backups aren't important, rysnc + mysqldump should work fine for your scenario. If you really need/want incrementals, Amanda or Bacula are good choices. My company has used Amanda for its backup needs for several years, and we've been very satisfied. Zmanda also provides a tool for backing up MySQL databases.\nWhatever solution you do chose, though, test your backups! Don't just check to see if the backup succeeded, do a restoration (preferably from \"bare metal\") to verify the files are restored correctly. There's nothing worse than discovering your backup is incomplete when you've just clobbered critical files.\nAlso, if you're backing up a production environment, make sure at least one of your backups is an encrypted off-site backup.\nGood luck!\n\nA: In my opinion backuppc is the best backup solution for multiple server.  \nBackuppc uses a dedicated server to backup different hosts.  Every hosts can be configured separately (what to backup, backup schedule, transfer method (including rsync), ...)\npre and post backup jobs can automatically be launched (e.g. dump mysql tables)\nadministration is done by web interface\ninstallation is done by apt-get install backuppc\n\n\nA: Try rsync, I think it will provide all the functionality you're looking for.  In order to handle MySQL you might need to write an additional cronjob to dump the database as well.  \n", "Q: How to move a file/window from one desktop to another desktop? I've updated the system to Ubuntu 11.10 and set Gnome Shell as default GUI. Now I cannot move files from one desktop to another. \nLet me illustrate this. I used to have Thunderbird maximized on desktop 1. When I create a new email and want to add attachments to it, I went to another desktop (desktop 2 or 3), grabbed the file from it, moved it to the left side of screen which made the screen rotate to desktop 1, and then just dropped the file into an email message. \nExample no.2. The same procedure was when I wanted to move an open screen of some app from one desktop to another.\nWith this new Gnome Shell, desktops do not rotate left and right, but up and down. If I grab a file on one desktop and move it to the top/bottom, the screen does not rotate at all. Of course, the same is with the left/right side.  \nSo, how can I made Gnome Shell rotate desktops when I touch one side of the screen (either top/bottom or left/right)? Has this been implemented at all?\nPS. I know that I can move screens via desktop shortcuts. However, they are useless when I want to move files. \nEDIT\nI found a way to move files. Grab it, move to upper left corner, navigate to the right desktop, touch some windows on that desktop to get focus and then drop the file into it. \n\nA: The only way to move a window from a workspace to the other one is launching to Activities Overview, and dragging the window to the list of workspaces on the right side of Activities Overview.\nYou can use screen edges for desktop switching with an extension.\nHere it is : https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/136/desktop-scroller\nWhen you scroll at the right edge of your screen, desktops are switching up and down.\nBy default, it uses right edge of screen.\n", "Q: How to create swap partition on already installed ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nAdding swap partition after system installation \n\ni have already installed ubuntu 11.04 without any swap partition.

Lets say it is (folder on Your host which You want to see from Win7 guest):\n/home/misery\n\nThis tutorial covers the answer. After adding Your Ubuntu folder to shared start or reboot Your Win7 VM You should search Your local area network (in Win7 guest; wait until it has searched it - the green progress bar).

Recently I've had some serious problems with running Half Life-based applications in Wine which all used to work fine. Those include Counter-Strike 1.6 and Day of Defeat for now. I'm using Steam to play those games. \nAfter a while in a multiplayer game the whole xorg crashes, I can't do anything and have to hard-reset my computer. And due to that, I'm sorry to say that I've been unable to grab a terminal output of the problem. \nI've tried different Catalyst drivers including 12.1, 11.12 and 11.10. I know that I've had no problems with 11.12 and 11.10 before, but now all of a sudden this happens. Also tried different wine versions, 1.4-rc2, 1.3.37 and 1.3.19 (which I used to run the applications with before). It is also not a \"gameoverlayrenderer.dll\" (which is a known crash-problem when running games with Steam using Wine) I've changed it off and on helplessly as well as changing compatible Windows versions in winecfg. \nAfter some serious searching at the web my conclusion is that this might have to do something with running opengl-applications in wine using fglrx. All though, switcihing from opengl to D3D in video settings still hangs xorg. Strange thing is that all used to work fine once.. \nI have yet to find a solution to the problem, any help is appreciated. \nRegards,\npanska\n\nA: I had some problems to.\nI did not find the reason why, but at a certain moment I uninstalled fgrlx completely, and reinstalled it afterwards.\nIt works fine again.

We are planning to install 80 ubuntu desktops in a college. The management told us to harden the ubuntu desktop as much as possible, like the user should not able to customize system settings for example changing wallpapers, themes etc etc..Could you all pls share your points in hardening a ubuntu system?

The pattern for that is .*, so you can use the --exclude '.*' option to exclude hidden files and directories. This option must come before other --include patterns because:\n\nA given file is excluded\n  by the file selection system  exactly  when  the  first  matching  file\n  selection  condition specifies that the file be excluded; otherwise the\n  file is included.\n\n(from man duplicity)\n\nA: The decision by the developer is to keep the options very simple. This has been requested several times, here and here are some bug reports/feature requests on the issue.\nAn easier way to achieve what you want is to add just the directories (/Documents, /Music, /Pictures, etc...) individually, instead of selecting the entire /Home directory. You likely have 10 or less folders in your /Home directory, so this is easier then manually excluding all the hidden folders and files.\nIt's a good question, but the answer is to use a workaround.\n\nA: In duplicity's GUI (\"Backup\" / deja-dup), if you want to list dot-file in your excluded files, you may be having difficulty selecting them via the GUI. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the plus (\"+\") icon under \"Folders\" tab and whichever category you wish (e.g. \"Folders to ignore\" category). This brings up a file browser. \n\n*If you want to select dot files (ie, \"hidden files\"), just right-click in some empty space in this file browser and choose \"show hidden files\".\n\n*Now you can make use of ctrl-click  or shift-click to select some or many or all of your dot files explicitly. \n\n\nThis does NOT answer the question, but the other answers referred to command line non-solutions.

I am using Windows as of now and want to install Ubuntu. I want to find out if my system is i386 or x86_64? How do I do that?\n\nA: Many of the suggestions here assume that if the system is capable of running 64-bit OS and programs, then the installed version of Windows is 64-bit as well. This is not necessarily the case, since it was common practice (and still is among some vendors) to install the i386 version by default since driver support was/is more mature there. \nThe best way to determine if you have a 64-bit-capable system is to figure out the CPU identifier and then using your favorite Internet search engine to find out if it is indeed a 64-bit processor or not.\nI would say that unless your consumer-grade computer is from around 2004 or earlier, odds are very good that it is 64-bit-capable.\n\nA: Another option is to just boot up a 64 bit iso (CD's are cheap, right?) and if it fails, then you have 32 bit.\nWhen I bought my windows license, I bought a 32 bit license (I don't know why) even though my laptop had a 64 bit processor.

Right now what i am doing is, i access the windows machine from vnc viewer and capture the screenshot. I would like to automate this process, is it possible? If yes how? Can anyone explain in detail?\n\nA: There are so many possibilities:\nSet up a webcam on your Linux box, point it to the Windows machine's screen so you can capture what's on it, set Windows up so that it doesn't lock or blank the screen. Install fswebcam and use cron to automate running it every 30 minutes. Create a file named e.g. cronfile containing this:\n*/30 * * * * fswebcam -q \"`date`.jpg\"\n\nThen activate the cronfile with:\ncrontab cronfile\n\nthis will put a timestamped file in your home dir every 30 minutes.\nThe first five fields in a crontab job definition decide when to run the job; this will simply run it every 30 minutes (*/30) of every hour, every day of every month (the 5th field allows you to decide which days of the week a job runs). The command that will be run is the rest of the line.\nfswebcam takes a filename on which to save the captured image. In this case, we build the filename by using the output of the date command (the backticks tell the shell to first run the command within, and place its output value in there, before running the rest of the line). I also used double-quotes because the output of date can contain spaces, so the filename has to be quoted to work.\nThat's all there is to it.\nAnother option is to use VNC the way you're using it now. You'd have to set up both the Windows system and the Linux one to not blank the screen after some period of inactivity. Then you could use a screen capture program (I suggest shutter) and automate it running every 30 minutes using the same cron technique I describe above.\n", "Q: RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported I'm getting some errors in my xen logs and googling has turned up that it's related to iproute2.\nI found through google that the key is to enable CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER=y in my kernel config.

What's the cleanest way to make changes to this file and have them take effect, without having to reboot? Typically, I've been doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file\n\n*service networking restart\nBut I have the impression that this isn't the \"right\" way to make these kinds of changes.\n\nA: Stop all interfaces using \nsudo /etc/init.d/networking stop\n\nConfigure (edit) your interfaces as you wish, then\nStart them again\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking start\n\nThere is no need to reboot.\n\nA: Shut the network interface down using\nsudo ifdown eth0\n\n(replace eth0 with the interface you want to change) and bring it up again using\nsudo ifup eth0\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu Server 16.04 and above you must use the ip command (man page) to flush the address before restarting networking, otherwise any address changes in the interfaces file will not take effect:\n$ sudo ip addr flush interface-name\n$ sudo systemctl restart networking\n\nI got this answer from this helpful article\n\nA: Why don't you think it is the right way. Think, what can ubuntu do extra during booting? Ubuntu has a list of services that need to run during booting, each service has a list of consecutive command to start itself. Ubuntu just run networking service through /etc/init.d/networking  script which contains some command that need to run network service. So if any change need to apply to your network then you have to restart your service and the way is recall your service's consecutive commands. \n\nA: /etc/network/interfaces controls the ifupdown tools.\nSo after making changes, you can just say eg sudo ifup eth0.\n\nA: Actually none of these work. Tested on Ubuntu 16.10. these had no effect. \n\n\n*\n\n*ifdown ens3 and ifup ens3\n\n*service network stop and start\n\n*service network reload\n\n*systemctl stop networking.service and then start again. \n\n\nThrough all these the old dhcp ip came back and not the static. i wonder if this is intentional? \n\nA: Try a flush between ifup and ifdown.

Suggestions?\n\nA: Mark Wagner's comment (from before this was migrated from Stack Exchange) is correct.  This is an Ubuntu 10.10 machine, after the switch to GRUB 2, and thus /boot/grub/menu.lst is obsolete and unused -- the real configuration file is /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\nHowever, there is an additional weirdness on this machine, as it turns out -- despite what the documentation at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 says, update-grub on this particular machine is not a stub to grub-mkconfig; it's still the old version that updates menu.lst.  Thus, running it did not update the correct configuration files like it should have.\n", "Q: What application in ubuntu that is like MDMA in Windows? I use MDMA in windows to connect my GSM modem.

Zoom in the selected icon to make it bigger?\nI don't see any options in ccsm for this.\nMaybe there is any better alternative for the default window switcher?\n\nA: I don't know of any way to change the colour of the alt+tab switcher in Unity, but you can use an alternative in Compiz. Let us look at the alternatives:\nBefore we start:\nCreate a nautilus script to reload Unity when ever it crashes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a text file called \"unityreloader\" (no file extension).\n\n*Place this text in it: \n\n\n\n #!/bin/sh\n unity\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Mark the file as executable and place it in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts\n\n*When ever you make a change in CCSM that causes Unity to exit, simply right click on the Desktop, choose scripts, and click unityreloader. This will restart Unity so you don't have to log out and back in.\n\n\nInstall the extra Compiz Plugins: Compiz-Plugins-Extra .\nShift-Switcher:\n\nThis plugin is not perfect, but it is rather aesthetically pleasing.\nBy default, it will have some minor conflicts, so you will need to change the keyboard shortcuts. Please not that any keyboard shortcut using super will probably cause problems or fail to work because Unity uses this for many actions.\nRing-Switcher:\n\nSimilar to the Shift-Switcher, however by default it exits when you release the shortcut key.\nScale:\n\nIf configured correctly, Scale can be used to show all windows on the workspace (or all workspaces).\n\nNB:\nThe following two caused Compiz to lock up on me when I enabled them (though they work after logging out and back in again) - use at your own risk:\nApplication Switcher and Static Application Switcher:\nThe most basic of all, these two are similar to the default app switcher, but show text colours correctly.\n\n\nA: I answered a similar question here: how to change Alt+Tab window highlight color in Unity 2D\nRequires some hacking, but answers the \"how to change glow color\" part of your question.\n", "Q: Unbinding F10 on a terminal I have noticed that if I press  F10 when on a terminal, Ubuntu or the terminal opens the File Menu.

It seems Ubuntu is doing that for me though as I haven't had to configure anything.\nWill creating a fixed size Virual Machine disc (VirtualBox) on the mounted (D:\\) partition make my virtual machine slower than if it were on a regular ext4 partition?\n\nA: All volumes must be mounted to be usable, so even if you changed the filesystem on your \"D:\\\" drive, you'd still have to mount it. That said, you probably won't notice much difference between ext4 and NTFS. A single virtual machine is not likely to push the limits of either filesystem. \nIf performance is a huge concern, you'll want to research filesystem benchmarking techniques. Phoronix has some information on such matters.\nA side note:\nThe Gnome environment handles a lot of the details of volume mounting, but the mounts aren't persistent: after you reboot, the mount will be gone. For any sort of non-trivial usage (such as virtualization), you will want to mount your \"D:\\\" drive with an /etc/fstab entry so it's mounted when the system starts up.\n", "Q: Desktop not fluid, mouse and screen jump every seconds I'm new on ubuntu and I'm having problems of fluidity.

I searched for a BIOS update of this computer and saw that the latest one is from mid 2007. SSDs hit the market a few years later, which sounds like no one ever fixed this. Also note, you may have bought your notebook 3 years ago (2008/2009?) but the particular product is from 2006. Installing a SSD brings a performance boost in most cases, but this sounds not quite like the right upgrade path, best choice would be to save that money spent on the SSD.

For those familiar with OSX, the behavior I'm looking for is open -g http://google.com, which will open a google webpage in the default browser in the background, without switching focus to it at all.\nI've been testing on stock Natty (Gnome, Unity...) with Chrome and then Firefox set to the default browser. I've tried both gnome-open http://google.com and xdg-open http://google.com, and with or without appending &>/dev/null & to the end, the browser window always gets focused. The only case where the browser doesn't get focus is when the default is Firefox and there is already a Firefox window open. I've also tried just calling firefox or google-chrome directly, and neither of them work.\nIs there some combination of commands or a package I could use to get the desired behavior more reliably, regardless of whether the default browser is Chrome or Firefox, or whether there's already a window open? This is for software to be installed on others' machines, so modifying their browser profiles is not really a solution...\n\nA: From what I understand most applications that run under X accept options on the command line that allow you to modify the behavior, I've found two options that may be of use:\n\n-xrm resourcestring\nResources  can  also  be  specified from the command line.  The\nresourcestring is a single resource name  and  value  as  shown\nabove.  Note that if the string contains characters interpreted\nby the shell (e.g., asterisk), they must be quoted.\n-iconic\nThis option indicates that the user would prefer that the application's windows initially not be visible as if the windows had\nbe immediately iconified by the user. Window managers may choose not\nto honor the application's request.\n\nThe first option will allow you to set properties on the command line, the only issue is I can't find the right string to use that would prevent focus or minimize the window.\nThe second option should start the program minimized however in my limited set of trials I was unable to get Firefox to honor the iconic option under XFCE leading me to believe that implementation of that flag is dependent on the program.\nYour best option is to look into setting Xresources using xrm, I will update this post if I find a good option for xrm.\nSidenote:\nFrom a UI/UX standpoint there is a good article on focus stealing, Please Don't Steal My Focus by Jeff Atwood if you haven't read it already it presents a good approach to focusing.\n", "Q: How do i switch video display output command line?

Use\nsudo apt-get install csh\n\nand then try running the script in the c-shell. You can open the c-shell by running csh from the bash shell.\n\nA: It is good form and reduces confusion to start all shell scripts by declaring the shell in which they should run.  The first line for a Borne shell (what you called \".sh\") is \"#!/bin/sh\".  That helps remove all confusion over which shell as each has nuances in its syntax and command structure.\nFor a Borne shell, the if command looks more like this:\nif [ $rule = \"deps\" ]; then\n # process based on HOSTTYPE\nfi\nA couple other suggestions, they may not be an issue here, but can bite you over time.\n1- define a consistent variable naming convention like all uppercase so you can read the code and identify variables easier.\n2- Use the curly braces to refer to variables so they cannot get \"confused\".\n3- When comparing strings, put your variables in quotes too.\nSo lets change the first line from\nif ($rule == \"\") set rule=\"all\"\n\nto\nif [ \"${rule}XXX\" = \"XXX\" ]; rule=\"all\"\n\nThe curly braces protect the confusing with the XXX, that syntax says the value of the variable \"rule\" with \"XXX\" appended to the end.  So if the result is only XXX then you know that the variable was empty or null.\nFor the hosttype, you can try adding another line like you have for rule:\nset HOSTTYPE=$2\n\nand then when you start the script add a second parameter where you enter the hosttype, e.g. build.sh deps i386\n", "Q: Incomplete D Drive access on which Ubuntu is installed I have installed Ubuntu using Wubi on my Windows partition (D Drive).

I noticed that I've got at least 3.2 GB of free RAM (using Gnome system monitor) and there was no swapping.\nWhat I did now is swapoff -a and system system performance is up by 30%. So my question is: Is it safe to use swapoff? Will it be safe for my PC to restart with swapoff?\n\n\nA: No it is not safe. The reason is that when the system runs out of RAM and will be unable to swap any of it, it might freeze with no chance for recovery other than a hard reset. It's not just about being able to suspend or not.\nSource: my 14.04 does that.\nYou should keep a minimum amount of swap space, look at the Ubuntu FAQ for numbers.\n\nA: Probably. You should read the 'Why Do I Need Swap' part of the Ubuntu FAQ page here, and judge for yourself.\nIf you value speed over the safety net swap can provide, you should disable it\nIf you never suspend to disk and always shut down and restart you can disable it safely.\nIf you have lots of RAM (your 4GB + VMs running is a close call) then you can.\nFor me, I have my OS on a SSD, 8GB RAM and never suspend. I don't need swap, have never seen it in use, and I just set it up at install out of habit. \nAs an alternative, here is an about:config tweak for Firefox from Lifehacker that explains how to use RAM only for the browser cache. Read the rebuttal linked at the bottom of the article before you try it. \n\nA: The Linux kernel provides a tweakable setting that controls how often the swap file is used, called swappiness\nA swappiness setting of zero means that the disk will be avoided unless absolutely necessary (you run out of memory), while a swappiness setting of 100 means that programs will be swapped to disk almost instantly.\nUbuntu system comes with a default of 60, meaning that the swap file will be used fairly often if the memory usage is around half of my RAM. You can check your own system's swappiness value by running:\none@onezero:~$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n60\n\nAs I have 4 GB of RAM, so I'd like to turn that down to 10 or 15. The swap file will then only be used when my RAM usage is around 80 or 90 percent. To change the system swappiness value, open /etc/sysctl.conf as root. Then, change or add this line to the file:\nvm.swappiness = 10\n\nReboot for the change to take effect\nYou can also change the value while your system is still running\nsysctl vm.swappiness=10\n\nyou can also clear your swap by running swapoff -a and then swapon -a as root instead of rebooting to achieve the same effect.\nTo calculate your swap Formula  \nfree -m (total) / 100 = A\n\nA * 10\n\nroot@onezero:/home/one# free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          3950       2262       1687          0        407        952\n-/+ buffers/cache:        903       3047\nSwap:         1953          0       1953\n\n\nso total is 3950 / 100 = 39.5 * 10 = 395\n\nso what it mean is that when 10 % 395 MB of ram left then it start using swapiness  \n", "Q: How to change the color of the scroll bar?

You don't need to look at it directly to have the idea where you are in the page.\nHow can I change it so that it has more contrast and I see where I am every time?\n\nA: The above changes the scroll bar for applications that use the gtk2 theme files. So does the gnome-color-chooser, (atleast the one in the current repository). For gtk3 applications, like gnome-terminal and gedit in 13.04 using gnome-fallback, one needs to change /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css.\nTo do this\nsudo gedit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css\n\nand replace the * scrollbar * section with this:\n/*************\n * scrollbar *\n *************/\n.scrollbar,\n.scrollbar.vertical {\n    -GtkScrollbar-has-backward-stepper: 0;\n    -GtkScrollbar-has-forward-stepper: 0;\n    -GtkRange-slider-width: 14;\n\n    border-radius: 3px;\n\n    border-image: none;\n}\n\n.scrollbar.trough,\n.scrollbar.trough.vertical {\n    border-color: shade (@bg_color, 0.64);\n}\n\n.scrollbar.trough.horizontal {\n}\n\n.scrollbar.slider,\n.scrollbar.slider:hover,\n.scrollbar.button,\n.scrollbar.slider.vertical,\n.scrollbar.slider.vertical:hover,\n.scrollbar.button.vertical {\n    border-width: 1px;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: shade (@bg_color, 0.4);\n    background-image: -gtk-gradient (linear, left top, right top,\n                                     from (shade (@button_bg_color, 0.76)),\n                                     to (shade (@button_bg_color, 0.62)));\n    box-shadow: inset 1px 0 shade (@button_bg_color, 0.85),\n                inset -1px 0 shade (@button_bg_color, 0.62),\n                inset 0 1px shade (@button_bg_color, 0.9),\n                inset 0 -1px shade (@button_bg_color, 0.62);\n}\n\n.scrollbar.slider.horizontal,\n.scrollbar.slider.horizontal:hover,\n.scrollbar.button.horizontal {\n    background-image: -gtk-gradient (linear, left top, left bottom,\n                                     from (shade (@button_bg_color, 0.76)),\n                                     to (shade (@button_bg_color, 0.62)));\n    box-shadow: inset 1px 0 shade (@button_bg_color, 0.85),\n                inset -1px 0 shade (@button_bg_color, 0.62),\n                inset 0 1px shade (@button_bg_color, 0.9),\n                inset 0 -1px shade (@button_bg_color, 0.62);\n\n}\n\n.scrollbar.button,\n.scrollbar.button:insensitive {\n}\n\nThis gives a scrollbar in gtk3 that looks like this: \n\nWhich is kinda similiar to the one for gtk2 above. The small ticks and proper steppers is not included here though.\n\nA: Found the solution: sudo and open /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and find this code:\nstyle \"scrollbar\" = \"button\" {\n\nBelow in the curly braces, change the bg[SOMETHING] lines to look like:\n    bg[NORMAL] = @selected_bg_color\n    bg[PRELIGHT] = shade (1.04, @selected_bg_color)\n\n    bg[ACTIVE] = shade (0.96, @selected_bg_color)\n\nOr look at the colors declared in line 1 of the file and select the one you prefer. To update the looks, in System settings/Appearance, change the theme to another one and back to Ambiance.\nedit: Appears that Xterm uses Radiance theme. Scrollbars in Radiance are black on black and are just invisible. So stylish, yeah! Need to do edit that theme too.\n\nA: A bit late, but perhaps I've found a quite nice, easy GUI solution:\ngnome-color-chooser \n\nHighlights:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely GUI solution, no need to manually fiddle with ~/.gtkrc\n\n*Only changes the settings you check.

Is there a way to adjust lighting step ? I have Lenovo L520, and Fn + Light Up or Down adjusts by 20%, how can I adjust the step to 10% ? it will help me fine tune lighting at my dark room.\n\nA: There is a file in Ubuntu which stores numerical integer value of brightness.\nyou will find 3 files in the directory /sys/class/backlight/<VGA>directory\nreplace directory with intel_backlight for intel cards. \nYou will find the max brightness value in max_brightness file and according to that value set the brightness in brightness file.\n\nA: For Xubuntu LTS\nFirstly, install xbacklight\n$ sudo apt install xbacklight\n\nSecondly, check whether you have control over the backlight.\n$ xbacklight -1\n$ xbacklight +5\n\n\nShould these commands result in a No outputs have backlight property error, then follow these remediating steps before proceeding.\n\nOnce xbacklight -1 and xbacklight +1 work from the command line, proceed with assigning these commands to respectively the XF86MonBrightnessDown and XF86MonBrightnessUp keys. This is done by hitting those keys when asked by the Settings â Keyboard â Application Shortcuts application.\nFinally, reboot for these changes to take effect.\n\n\nA: You can install xcalib and then type the command:  \nxcalib -co 50 -a\n\nUse xcalib -h for help regarding it's options.\n\nA: As Colin Ian King said, the levels of brightness are hardware related.\nSome laptop screens have 8 levels of brightness and new ones have 16 levels.\nOn Windows OSes you can change the levels with 1% steps, but they will be rounded to the nearest hardware level. It depends on the screen type.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04, with Intel onchip graphics (i5) under LXQt, it is sufficient to assign xbacklight commands to the brightness function keys XF86MonBrightness(Down|Up) using the global key shortcut settings. These seem to override the defaults even if /sys/module/video/parameters/brightness_switch_enabled is set to Y, while the original functionality on virtual terminals is retained.\n\nAn alternative to the original xbacklight would be acpilight, but unfortunately this isn't available as Ubuntu package. As it doesn't depend on an X display running, you can also associate it with ACPI button events and use it from the console. Additionally it can store the current brightness on shutdown and restore it on boot.\n\nA: My solution was to install 'xbacklight'\nThen I created keyboard shortcuts such as\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrlshift+ with command xbacklight +5\n\n*ctrlshift- with command xbacklight -5\nSo when you use those shortcuts they call the related command \nhowever I could not replace the system inbuilt brightness buttons to use these commands\nYou can use almost any keyboard shortcut button combination you like with xbacklight.\n\nA: For me xbacklight did not work (EDIT: probably because I did not reboot my machine), therefore I created my own script which uses the built-in gsd-backlight-helper.\nThis script uses smaller steps, especially when the screen is quite dark already.\nStep 0: check if it works (optional)\nTo see if it works you could try:\npkexec /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gsd-backlight-helper --get-brightness\n\nThis should output a number.\nStep 1: save script\nSave the following script in an .sh file, for instance in /home/me/scripts/brightness.sh.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmax=$(pkexec /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gsd-backlight-helper --get-max-brightness)\ncur=$(pkexec /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gsd-backlight-helper --get-brightness)\nif [ $(($max/$cur)) -ge 25 ]\nthen\n    step=$((max/300+1))\nelse if [ $(($max/$cur)) -ge 5 ]\n    then\n        step=$((max/50+1))\n    else\n        step=$((max/20+1))\n    fi\nfi\ncase \"$1\"\nin\n+) new=$((cur+step));;\n-) new=$((cur-step));;\nesac\npkexec /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gsd-backlight-helper --set-brightness $new\n\nStep 2: assign shortcuts\nOpen Keyboard Shortcuts from the Settings menu and assign shortcuts:\nname:     Darker\ncommand:  sh /home/me/scripts/brightness.sh -\nshortcut: Super + F5\n\nname:     Brighter\ncommand:  sh /home/me/scripts/brightness.sh +\nshortcut: Super + F6\n\n\nA: Install xbacklight by opening a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T shortcut and type this:\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nthen after installation, type these commands in terminal:\nxbacklight = 10\nxbacklight = 20\nxbacklight = 5\n\nthis may help.\n\nA: The brightness levels are generally under ACPI control with the levels defined in firmware. For example the ACPI control method _BCL  \"Query List of Brightness Control Levels Supported\" informs the kernel how many brightness levels are supported.  You can't realistically change this.\n\nA: In my case (Lenovo T500) the problem is, that the brightness regulating key-press is applied twice - once by using the Xwindows, but also independently in the lower level, by kernel's graphic driver itself. So the brightness steps are twice as big as usual.\nThe working solution is to deny the low-level functionality, by adding this line to /etc/rc.local (just before the line with 'exit 0'):\necho -n 0 > /sys/module/video/parameters/brightness_switch_enabled\n\nThis way it will perfectly work in logged-in X session, unfortunately it will remove the key-press brightness regulation functionality in all other cases (console terminal, X login screen etc).\n\nA: Official documentation:\nhttps://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xbacklight.1.html\n\ninc percent\nIncreases brightness by the specified amount.\ndec percent\nDecreases brightness by the specified amount.\n\nExample:\nxbacklight -inc 10%\nxbacklight -dec 10%\n\nA: Brightness cannot controlled with large precision. I'm afraid that you're stuck with those brightness levels. To be sure, try controlling the brightness using these terminal commands.\n\nA: You could try setting it manually. First you have to get the PCI-ID of the VGA device:\nlspci\n\nThen try this (in my case the PCI-Device is 00:02.0)\nsudo setpci -s 00:02.0 f4.b=FF\n\nThe 2 letters at the end of the Line set the new brightness ranging from 00-FF (0-255)\n\nA: If you are using Nvidia Graphic card..you can easily use my new method of brightness changing,and edit values in Code.. theres two files and two options within each one.\nfind these two lines:\nif ( $value > 0.0) { $value = $value - 0.30 };  \nif ( $value2 > 1.1) { $value2 = $value2 - 0.08 }; \n\nchange values of ($value > 0.0) & ( $value2 > 1.1) \nand see whats happens!\nmeanwhile if you dont want to change values and wish to use my method originally you can\nchange brightness in a wide range and 5 steps.\nwish you like it\nlink of method: https://askubuntu.com/a/179063/82136\n\nA: If you're on KDE, you can simply hover your cursor over the \"Battery and Brightness\" menu from your system tray and try to slowly scroll upwards or downwards to increment or decrement the brightness.\n\n\nA: On modern Gnome environment you can achieve fine-control effect with mouse scroll:\nIf you have smooth-scroll touchpad, position mouse pointer over brightness slider from top-right menu and perform fine two-finger scroll to adjust brightness with tiniest steps.\n\n\nA: Hold down Ctrl while increasing/decreasing the brightness. Increases in steps of 1.\n", "Q: How can I fix the gnome-shell? I am using gnome-shell on Ubuntu 11.10. After I installed some of the extensions, whenever it logs in; it would not show the userbar (the one with the clock etc).

I have a HP DM4 Beats Edition running Ubuntu 11.10. The HP Pavillion runs on-board Intel graphics as well as Radeon GPU.\nFrom what I have read it appears that the Radeon GPU is draining my battery and also causing the laptop to overheat. Battery life is down to under two hours when using the machine for simple tasks and the unit is heating up excessively.\nI tried activating the ATI FGLRX driver - but it was not successful. I also have installed the CPU control applet.\nFor now i just want to disable the GPU and use the Intel on board graphics.\nIs there a way that I can force the system to just use the Intel Graphics?\nI am very new to Ubuntu and need some basic help.\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with vgaswitcheroo since 10.10. Therefore you can although it is far away from working as smooth as on Windows. Yet it's enough to turn off either one of the cards and/or switch to using the other ones.\nYou find more information on this topic on help.ubuntu and this linux.blogspot.\nSince you are fairly new to Ubuntu, I'll tell you the essential commands:\nchmod -R 705 /sys/kernel/debug # this isn't noted on the help.ubuntu-page, yet I had to do this since 11.04\nchown -R $YOURUSERNAME:$YOURUSERNAME /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo # where $YOURUSERNAME is your user name\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch # this will turn off your currently unused card. This is normally the discrete one.\n\nThese commands shouldn't work with fglrx installed I guess, because it has its own switching mechanism (which doesn't work for me).\nFor switching between cards, you would write DDIS (for discrete) and DIGD (for integrated) instead of OFF. Note that you will see a change only after you have logged off. Still the other card will already be turned on; consuming power and spinning its fan.\n\nA: I'm using a Sony VAIO VPCSB2 laptop with switchable graphics (Intel integrated / ATI 6470M) and have lost a lot of time with this also...\nEasiest way to solve the problem, as said above, is to add:\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nto your rc.local file (sudo gedit /etc/rc.local, add before line \"exit 0\"). It quick and dirty, but will power off the ATI adapter at startup. The limitations are:\n\n\n*\n\n*No ATI accelerated graphics, obviously :)\n\n*Bad sleep / suspend support (the ATI adapter may wake up together with the laptop...)\n\n\nSince release 12.1, the Catalyst drivers do support hybrid graphics, on my notebook at least, but it required a bit of work (not sure that all steps are required in the end, but at least it worked):\nMake sure that you don't use vgaswitcheroo already :)\nPrerequisites install\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs fakeroot dh-make debhelper debconf libstdc++6 dkms libqtgui4 wget execstack libelfg0 dh-modaliases\n\nOn a x64 system, add:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nCreate this symlink (this prevented the driver package compilation to fail later on in my case):\nsudo ln -svT lib /usr/lib64\n\nDownload the driver from ATI and create the packages:\nsh ./ati-driver-installer-11-11-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/oneiric\n\nInstall the packages:\nsudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb\n\nConfigure the driver:\nsudo aticonfig --initial -f\n\nReboot and pray. If it works you will be presented with your standard login prompt. Log in and start the Catalyst Control Center as an administrator. You can then finally choose in a GUI which GPU you want to use (reboot required).\nIf it does not work (you have to login in a command prompt) and you want to retry, do some cleanup before restarting the procedure:\nsudo aticonfig --uninstall    \nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev* xorg-driver-fglrx\n\nThe big disadvantage with the Catalyst driver is that Unity will work only in 2D mode on the Intel adapter (with the \"native\" intel driver, standard Unity works well).\nI found no solution for this last problem, therefore in my case I switched back to the switcheroo solution.\n", "Q: Lost sound with 11.10 I installed Ubuntu some days ago.

So I was wondering, if you want to promote your published app, what should you do? (Aside from the most obvious things like Tweeting, etc.)\nWhat options does a software developer for Ubuntu has for promoting his/her applications? Are there any specific review sites or such?\nI think this game I made should get some more attention because its the first game about Kakuro/Cross Sums games.

I've been looking on the Internet for an answer and haven't found a concrete one. If I want to change the runlevel it is okay to use just init or do I always have to call it through telinit. \nI've read that telinit is in fact a symlink to init. If this is correct, can I use them interchangeably?\n\nA: The manual page telinit(8) answers your question: use telinit.\n\ntelinit may be used to change the system runlevel.\n\n\nA: It should be fine to change the runlevel with either one. As init is supposed to check if it is the real init process. Or just a telinit, by checking if it's pid is one, not by the name of the file.\nSo yes, you should be able to use them interchangeably.\nHowever, I cannot guarantee there are no non-conforming systems, where this will not work out. It is best to check yourself if it works as intended on your install.\n\nA: init is the primary process that is the parent to all other processes. It starts at boot and checks out your /etc/inittab and a bunch of other settings. It also has the notion of the runlevel and knows, from your /etc/init.d settings for instance, which processes to start/stop when you switch between runlevels.\ntelinit is a smaller tool that informs init when it needs to switch runlevels. So you can use \"telinit\" to \"tell init\" that it needs to switch runlevel.\nA quick example:\nwhen you boot into graphical mode (runlevel 5), init will start and launch all programs associated for runlevel 5 (itself being the parent process of all those). When you then ask to shutdown the machine, telinit will inform the -still running- init process that it needs to switch to runlevel 6 (for reboot) or 0 (for system halt).\nSee \"man init\" for details on runlevels.\n", "Q: Nvidia Dual Displays not being detected I just installed Ubuntu for the first time, downloaded 11.04 and updated to 11.10.\nI have a setup with a NVidia 7600GT Graphics Card, with DVI-Out and VGA-Out.

The normal VNC package appears to operate via the unuseful default, where you can only login to an existing desktop. How do you configure Ubuntu to create a new session when someone logs in via VNC?\n\nA: x11vnc \nInstall X11vnc server on the remote desktop for access to the login screen, or access to an existing session.\nLightdm via VNC\nOn the remote machine run x11vnc as root (e.g. through a ssh session)\nroot@remote:# x11vnc -auth /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority -display :0\n\nThen on our desktop here view the remote login screen with\nvncviewer -via user@remote :0\n\nThe remote session started from the login screen will survive after we closed our vncviewer session.\nView existing remote desktop\nOn the remote machine run x11vnc as the user logged in (e.g. through a ssh session where you can log in as the remote user)\nuser@remote:$ x11vnc -display :0\n\nTo export the display :0 for remote viewing.\nOn our desktop here run the viewer by\nvncviewer -via user@remote :0\n\n\nA: I'm sure this is possible with VNC on Ubuntu, but try NX from NoMachine. It's free (as in beer) for Linux and has a nice session management client that will not only start up a new remote desktop session for you, but let you reconnect to existing sessions.\nNeatX and freeNX are free (as in speech) NX servers. x2go is a free NX replacement.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro/oneric Multitouch support - how to I configure multitouch actions? I have switched my Macbook Pro 5.1 over to Ubuntu, because OS X Lion was dragging its heels on the 2.5-year-old hardware (sickeningly short old-hardware-support half-life... grrr)\nAnyway, most of ubuntu is up and happy fine, but I want to be able to multitouch swipe my way around workspaces like you can in OS X.\nNow I know that ubuntu is detecting the three-finger swipe (and indeed differentiating a 4-finger one) because it's configured to move the windows around the screen with that particular gesture.\nSo, how do I hook into that event, the three finger swipe, and reassign the action to moving workspaces?\nEDIT:\nSo, trying Alexandre's suggestion below, I've now got a problem with touchegg.\nI've tried putting in a new section in xorg.conf as suggested here (following instructions for the MBP 7.1,) but that makes this significantly worse - the clever velocity scaling goes, and the trackpad is far too responsive when just moving the cursor. The developer only provides documentation for 10.10 and 11.04, and the latter is supposed to be fully working and \"automatic\" - these were the instructions for 10.10.\nIn addition I've noticed, by running touchegg in the shell instead of a startup daemon, that it only detects 2-finger motion (both with and without the xorg hack) no higher multitouch gestures. \nThis is all very puzzling because, as I said, three finger gestures work, with a compiz animation (moving a non-maximised window). I guess it can't be a missing kernel module or something, since it works sometimes, so could compiz be swallowing all the events? If so, how would I test?\nEDIT2:\nI've tested unity 2D vs 3D (which seems to be how you disable compiz) and partial success. With compiz disabled touchegg can see all the multitouch events of the rainbow. However, it can't seem to run anything other than the \"Nautilus Drag Window\" event with the three finger gesture - this implies to me that nautilus is hooking into this event a bit too low down for me to get at!\nI'm marking Alexandre's answer correct, since touchegg is one way to do this within the scope of the original question. I may post a more specific question later when I've figured out how to get this working exactly as I want!\n\nA: TouchÃ©gg should allow you to do what you want.\nThe main application can be installed from repositories (click here to install it).\nIn order to configure it you have to install a separated package, it is not distributed with Ubuntu: 32 bits, 64 bits.\nSource: OMG Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to calculate Network bandwidth, disk space, processing power and memory of a msg I need to calculate the Network bandwidth, disk space, processing power and memory of some messages that i exchanged between two computers (sender and receiver).\nFor example if the message is \"I am working for three (3) hours\"\nHow much network bandwidth will it use?\nHow much disk space will be used?\nHow much processing power will be utilize at the sender and the receiving end?\nHow much disk space will be used at both the ends?\nif i will send this message 10, 100, or 1000 times.\nThanks for your guidance.\n\nA: It depends on how you plan to send, process, and store the message.\nASCII is one byte per character, or 7 bits if you're restricting it to printable characters.   So \"I am working for three (3) hours\" is 32 bytes.  If you wrote that to a file 1000 times, you'd have 32000 bytes.  If you compressed it, it would be much smaller; text compresses well.\nSending it over the network would depend on the protocol you're using to send it; plan on a few hundred bytes of overhead for each message.  You can use Wireshark or iptraf to get a detailed view of how much network traffic is passing through your machine.\nThe processing power required to send or receive 32000 bytes is negligible.  In general, your computer's network bandwidth will become a bottleneck before you the CPU, unless you're doing something complex with the input/output.\n", "Q: Nautilus opens twice in Classic Gnome Environment: Ubuntu 11.10 / 12.04 with Classic Gnome\nSituation: Choose Nautilus of specific location\nProblem: It looks like Nautilus is opening 2 windows. After a while the second one dies.\nQuestion: Why and how to prevent that problem?\n\nA: If you wish to stop this behavior pending a gnome bug fix you may try this, tested on 12.04\nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop\nLook for this line StartupNotify=true, change it to StartupNotify=false\nThen restart nautilus or simply do a log out/in\nThere are 2 other nautilus .desktop's, home-folder.desktop & nautilus-folder-handler.desktop, I believe you can leave them as is\n\nA: In general, if you start an app in GNOME Fallback mode, the window list button first displays 'Opening App' which then changes to 'App' after the application has started. This is to indicate startup. Not so with Nautilus. When it starts the 'Opening $LOCATION' message is displayed on another window list button.\nsee: http://imagebin.org/198417\nBtw.

When I restart I couldn't boot .\nWhat is the solution ?\n\nA: Without error messages or more detailed explanations of what happens, it is really hard to tell what the computer is doing. However, a possible cause of errors is that your boot loader (GRUB) cannot find the old version of Ubuntu and fails while it is trying to create the boot-up menu. \nYou can try to recover the system using various commands from a LiveCD, but if you don't want to deal with all that, a simpler solution is to just install the new one again.

However, checking it doesn't seem to have any effect, at least with the shortcuts I know. I can't seem to find any documentation about this anywhere, in the help files or on google. What are these shortcuts, exactly, and how can I get them to work? \n\nA: I am in Kubuntu 12.04 and they work ok. They used to work on Konqueror too.

I have apache installed from the repositories. I have some programs installed such as ownCloud or sitebar. When I visit their web pages over the Internet using addresses like https://myserver.com/owncloud, if I then click on a link within the web page that appears, it takes me to a http address such as http://myserver.com/owncloud/linkiclickedon and the page appears white.\nI have to always keep changing the URLs to https. How can I correct this behaviour?\nTh site installed on the server is located at for example, http://myserver/owncloud, but I am taking it through stunnel to give it some security when accessing it online.\n\nA: From the description of the stunnel4 package, it looks like that the application just acts as a secured messenger: at the server side data is encrypted, at the client side it's unencrypted without touching the message contents itself (like rewriting http:// URLs to https://). Since you control the Apache server, you are recommended to configure SSL on Apache. For example, see How to easily deploy HTTPS in ubuntu 10.04?\n", "Q: Error when installing Makefile: \"make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.

Stop.\n\nI looked inside the folder-xf86-video-intel-2.17.0 and there is a file named \"Makefile.in\"\nit supposed to be a in file, right?\n\nA: Just remember that in order for the ./configure file to run you made need a compiler.  So do something like sudo apt-get install gcc.  then run ./configure again and should work\n\nA: That happens because there is no file named Makefile in that directory. To create that Makefile, you need to execute\n$ ./configure\n\nThe configure script determines if your system has all the dependencies necessary to compile the application. If a dependency is not found, the configure will fail and the Makefile's will not be created. To solve that, you must install all the dependencies needed by the application.\nThe application xf86-video-intel seems to be provided by the xserver-xorg-video-intel package, and its dependencies may be easily installed by running\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nFor more information, you might want to read the README or INSTALL files.\n\nA: The make command looks for a file called \"Makefile\", no extension, not \"Makefile.in\". Since the file is not found, make does not know what to do, and stops. (The error message is cryptic because in some rare cases, make can guess what to do without an actual Makefile.)\nRead the instructions on how to compile your program.

They way I got into the problem was canceling a backup to postpone figuring out a password for it.

This thread got me thinking how to fix it.  \nCause:  Turns out that my system had autodetected the alternate display outputs, which I was not using, and had enabled a second display.  I was rolling right off my display into a ghost display on the right.  \nSolution:  I turned off the second display in settings and the problem went away.  Of course, I'll probably have to enable it again when I plug my HDMI TV in to watch a movie but no big deal there. \n\nA: I did a clean install of ubuntu 12.04 x64, and the issue is gone now.\n", "Q: Redirecting directories in home partition I have a 60GB SSD for my / filesystem but for more space I got a 16GB SD card for my /home partition.

So I was wondering if it would be a good idea to sys-link some directories to a home2 directory I have made in the / partition and I wanted to know what directories I should link.\nI have already done this with downloads but should I do this using .~/cache or .~/config?\n\nA: The lower bound for write accesses to flash memory is said to be 100Â 000 cycles. So for most usages of your home partition, this means they are no problem. \nHow long do you need to write 16 GB to your home? If you fill the whole drive 30 times per day, you can repeat this procedure 10 years, where the price for such a storage will be about Nothing. \nDo you have frequent write access for many, big files? In the end, only yourself can answer the question. The firefox-cache in /home/YOURNAME/.mozialla/firefox is something, which is changed frequently, but if it could be a problem depends on your surf habits. \nfind  /home/YOURNAME/.mozilla/firefox -mtime -1 -ls\n\nwill show you how many files and how big there are, younger than one day. Daily work on big, raw images could be another issue, but 100Â 000 writes are a lot, and sometimes it is said to be 5Â 000Â 000 writes. \nIf 95% of the drive is statically filled, and the dynamic writes/deletes happen to affect always the same 5% of the drive, the lifespan in only 5%. \n", "Q: Cannot open my external hard drive anymore I was using it to back up two laptops: an IBM ThinkPad running Xubuntu 11.10 with a Qimo session, and an LG R200 running Ubuntu 11.10. \nI had previously backed-up both computers, several times using Deja Dup, into separate folders onto the Seagate hard drive.

(I ask because python seems to be an important component in Ubuntu.). \nI've built pypy and have installed it on a virtual machine of Ubuntu (I'm testing this idea out before I do it to my actual machine. So while we can try thing my intention is to accomplish this in \"real life\" as it were.). \nPypy is usable from the anywhere in the system via pypy as opposed to python. \npypy my_python_script.py\n\nIt seems to be installed fine and seems usable. \nNow, I want to make it so that any time I want to use python, it'll assume I mean pypy. \nFor example, I installed Django in to pypy but when I try to run django-admin.py it has no idea what I'm talking about. I imagine I could accomplish this part by adding wherever django-admin.py is to my $HOME variable. \nThat, for now, is aside the point. \nSo, my question is how do I replace standard python with my own preferred version -- in this case, pypy. \n\nI'm revising my question based on the answer thus far -- that replacing CPython in whole is not a good idea as it could foobar the system. \nI've read a bit on virtualenv -- looks good but it doesn't seem to answer my question (or, I'm missing how). \nI want to use pypy for my work in python. Development work for things like, Django, Google App Engine and other such nonsense. (I realize there could be a compatibility issue, I'll address those with unit tests or some other means. Just know, it's beside the point at the moment.) \nSo, keeping this in mind, say I want to use pypy instead of python. And for ./django-admin.py to work globally, it'd have to be installed with the system's python. How might I configure the system to support these \"global\" python scripts from either pypy or the main system python? \n\nA: It is not a good idea to mess with system python because, as you have noticed, Ubuntu uses python widely so any change may render your system unstable.\nMoreover, as a developer, I can tell you that globally installing third-party libraries into your system Python is not a good idea either - everything will start falling apart as soon as you have two projects which require different versions of Django, for example.\nLuckily, Python has very good tools for creating isolated environments which may be completely independent from the system Python.\nHave a look at virtualenv and zc.buildout (along with djangorecipe) for a civilized solution to your problem. :)\nUPDATE: Very briefly, here's how zc.buildout would solve your problem:\nYou create a directory where you put bootstrap.py and buildout.cfg file which contains\n[buildout]\nparts = django\nversions = versions\n\n[versions]\ndjango = 1.2.5\n\n[django]\nrecipe = djangorecipe\nsettings = development\neggs = ${buildout:eggs}\nproject = mymegaapp\n\nThen you run /path/to/python/interpreter/python bootstrap.py, at which point your buildout \"remembers\" which python interpreter you used. It also creates a bin directory where all your \"global\" scripts will be auto-generated. Then you run bin/buildout, which downloads and installs Django of specified version, creates an empty project called \"mymegaapp\" etc. After it's finished, you'll find django command in the bin directory which is equivalent to django-admin.py, so you can run\nbin/django syncdb\nbin/django runserver\n\netc. You never have to worry to remember to use the correct interpreter. Of course, this is just a very small part of what you can do with buildout... just think about putting buildout.cfg into a VCS so you can re-build the application with all the dependencies at exact versions, even in a few years from now... or about having multiple configs for different \"deployment configurations\" :)\nFor a quick example how to do this with virtualenv you can have a look at this article - the instructions should work apart from the very first part - you'll need to install setuptools with your pypy, not with the 'standard' interpreter. Then you'll use python script generated in your sandbox's bin directory:\ncd myapp\n../venv/bin/python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n\n(I have a feeling the question becomes less and less relevant to Ubuntu... should we ask for it to be migrated to stackoverflow?)\n", "Q: Why apt-get purge wants to install packages while I use --no-download and --no-install-recommends?

It has always worked fine with everything else.  I also have shutdown issues in Unity (and maybe Gnome shell) with the proprietary drivers.\nI find that everything works well with the standard drivers.  My computer will even suspend successfully that way.  However, I have tried gnome shell a few times, and it never lasts long before I give up on it.  I'm using gnome classic with compiz, and Awn launcher. and the Cardapio menu.  I find I like this best so far.\nIf you don't need the proprietary drivers, try it without them.  I don't notice any difference, but then, I don't play games or anything.\n\nA: This is a bug with the current version of the fglrx graphics driver. There are two ways to solve it:\nYou can remove fglrx and use the built in driver instead. You can remove the fglrx driver in System Settings âº Additional Drivers. Select the driver that is currently installed and click Deactivate. That might solve everything, depending on how well the built in driver supports your graphics card. It might feel a lot better in some cases, because it is much better integrated, but results are quite varied.\nSo, your other option is to manually upgrade to the latest version of the fglrx driver. This bug is (almost) fixed in version 12.1. Upgrading is explained on the Ubuntu Wiki:\nFirst, download the latest drivers from http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx\nAnd remember where you have downloaded them\nOpen a terminal and type the following:\ncd ${*Where you downloaded the driver*}\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libqtgui4\nsudo sh amd-driver-installer-*.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/oneiric\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nIn the step with amd-driver-installer-*, you might need to change that to the name of the file you downloaded.\nAnd then restart your computer.\nAfter you do that, you might find that Gnome Shell still runs quite slowly, even with the latest fglrx. If that is the case, you need to set something in an environment variable.\nOpen a terminal again, and type the following:\ngedit ~/.profile\nA text editor will appear, showing your .profile file. At the very bottom of the file, add a new line with the following:\nexport CLUTTER_VBLANK=\"none\"\n\nNow log out and log in again.\n", "Q: Unable to update Ubuntu 10.10 installed in MacBook Pro with dual boot So, this is my problem:\nI was able to install Ubuntu 11.10 in dual boot in my MacBook Pro 5.1 with rEFIt.

I have a DELL inspiron n5110 with an nVidia 525m and i7-2630QM. Well after a bit of reading and confusing myself I followed instructions in this tutorial, which seemed to work. The battery usage dropped from ~2000 to ~1600. Thou it's not as much as I'd like to. So I tried the Intel tweaks.\nAfter applying the Intel tweaks it didn't take any effect, I think I did something wrong. Thou I'm not sure. But the comments stated that most people saw a drop to ~1000. \nI wanted to try just disabled the card on boot with the instructions here:\nhttp://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch, but I can't open /etc/modules trough the terminal. It says \"Permission denied\" or \"Command not found\" if I use sudo /etc/modules.\nI'm not sure what other info do you need to be able to make any sense of this. So just ask and tell you what I can. I'd need to achieve a much lower usage one way or another, because I need to the laptop in class. \n\nA: Bumblebee installation instructions can also be found in Is a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu?\nIt includes bbswitch by default, so you do not have to get the code from the Git repository nor edit /etc/modules (it's a file, not a command/program!) because the card is disabled when Bumblebee starts. Keep in mind that the power usage depends on the machine your have. For example, I have a GT425M GPU with an i5-460M CPU. That'll use way less power than an i7 processor. To improve battery life:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lower the brightness level of the screen\n\n*Disable wireless if you are only taking notes or reading PDFs in class and do not need to use Internet\n\n*Disable the webcam (Fn + ??) and other unnecessary peripherals like Bluetooth\n\n*Apply the Intel module options as mentioned in Battery life decreased after upgrade to 11.04\n", "Q: GRUB2: Use maximum detected resolution? How do I tell GRUB2 to set its resolution (and also the one passed to the kernel) to the maximum one it can detect at time of boot?\n\nA: I presume the reason you are asking about this is that you use different monitors on the same Ubuntu machine and you want GRUB2 to look good on all of them. However, if you are concerned about the resolution used once Ubuntu boots, this does not address that. GRUB2 does not \"pass on to the kernel\" the resolution it selects for the boot menu.\nEdit /etc/default/grub as root. You may want to back it up first:\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.old\n\n(You would run that in the Terminal, which you can open by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.)\nTo edit it with Gedit as root run:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n(Or if you're using Kubuntu, run kdesudo kate /etc/default/grub instead.)\nYou'll get a lot of messages in the Terminal, if you run that command in the Terminal rather than with Alt+F2. You'll notice they don't say they pertain to the file you're editing, so that's fine.\nYou'll find that part of the file says something like this:\n# The resolution used on graphical terminal\n# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE\n# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nUncomment (i.e., remove the leading # from) the line that says GRUB_GFXMODE, and change the resolution from 640x480 to auto. The line should now read:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=auto\n\nSave the file and quit the editor. In the Terminal, run:\nsudo update-grub\n\n(This must be run after every modification to /etc/default/grub, to apply the changes.)\nNow reboot, and see if that does what you want.\nIt might not (as it uses the \"platform default\" which might not be the highest possible). If that is the case, edit /etc/default/grub again, and this time change the line so it says something like:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1600x1200,1280x1024,1024x768,800x600,640x480\n\nYou will not necessarily want to use exactly that line. You should list all the resolutions you want to be tried, in the order you want them to be tried. The resolutions I have listed are the most standard resolutions for monitors with a 4:3 aspect ratio, but widescreen monitors (including most laptop screens these days) have different form factors and use different resolutions. Wikipedia has a list of common resolutions which may help you. If you know the specific resolutions you want for each device, you can just list them (highest first). You should probably include 640x480 or auto at the end . I recommend this because I don't know if GRUB2 will always try a safe low resolution, if you don't include that.\nThen save the file again, run sudo update-grub again, reboot again, and see if that does what you need.\nIf it doesn't, you may be out of luck. GRUB2 doesn't display video the same way as Ubuntu does once it's booted. GRUB2 uses VESA BIOS Extensions to display the boot menu with enhanced resolution (and color depth), and a machine's maximum resolution through VBE is not always as high as the maximum resolution supported by the video card and monitor.\nSource: The official GRUB2 documentation. (You'll notice the version number is 1.99. It's still GRUB2. A bit confusing, but true.)\n[Finally, thanks to TechZilla for pointing out a serious error in the original version of this answer.]\n\nA: There's also a GUI option available.\nGrub Customizer:\nGrub Customizer allows to edit, rename, re-order or freeze Grub entries. It also allows to change the background colors of Grub menu or add a custom picture and supports BURG customization also.

You can also specify resolution as a sequence of one or more modes, separated by commas (â,â) or semicolons (â;â); each will be tried in turn until one is found. For example:\n1440x900,1680x1050,1920x1200,2560x1600\nOr specified with depth (8, 16 or 24):\n1440x900x16,1680x1050x16,1920x1200x16,2560x1600x16\n\nClose the Preferences dialog box and click save on the toolbar of main window.

It may be something in a configuration file, faulty driver, or even a kernel bug.  \nYou can try this debugging procedure.  At least it will give you more info you can report back on.  \nAs for the LXDE problem, I have a big suspicion it is not a real issue.  LXDE doesn't load a lot of the same stuff as Unity/Gnome.  So even if in Unity you set your laptop to suspend on lid closing, that preference may not hold anymore in LXDE.

The BIOS has three options regarding the graphic cards - integrated, discrete, and Optimus.\nThe use case is very simple. For work, I just use the integrated card and the laptop display; when I watch movies though, I want to use my projector. Now, what I have to do in this case is:\n\n\n*\n\n*reboot\n\n*start windows\n\n*watch the movie\n\n\nThanks to Bumblebee, I'm able now to keep the setup always as Optimus.\nBefore BB, I had to change the BIOS setting every time I wanted to watch a movie, because even in windows, using integrated graphics caused the projector not to be detected by the system (I suppose that this is what they generally mean by \"hardwired output\", and that the VGA output is hardwired to the discrete card).\nNow, what I'd like to do, is to be able to connect the external monitor without having to switch O/S, that is, to use it in Ubuntu.\nIs it possible?\nRight now, if I want to use the external monitor on Ubuntu, the only option is to change the BIOS to use the discrete graphics, then use nvidia-settings.\nIf I use instead the Optimus setup, even when I run it using \"optirun nvidia-settings -c :8\", I don't get any option for an external monitor.\nIs there something I can do?\n\nA: I have a W520. It is not the same setup as the T420 - the VGA output is wired to the nvidia card, so the \"this\" link from Samsagax will not work. I've prepared a blog post here outlining the options you have. I was unable to get either external monitor to work with Bumblebee, and I do not believe it is possible with the W520. However, you can use an extenal monitor in optimus mode, but you either have to use xinerama or open a separate X screen on the extenal monitor.\n\nA: (redirected from linux-hybrid-graphics list)\nI have a Thinkpad T420 which might be similar (but may be not).\nOn my T420, VGA is attached to the Intel and Display-Port is attached to the NVIDIA. So for the VGA output I can use the usual xrandr.\nThe Display-Port is a different story. For that I have to change the xorg.conf from bumblebee in /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia:\nThe option ConnectedMonitor from DFP (the default) to DP1 for DisplayPort.\n\nA: Newer versions of the Intel driver include a program called intel-virtual-output which greatly simplifies setup of double and triple displays on a W520.\nThe intel-virtual-output command provides a way for an X server on the Intel card to duplicate screens to another X server. It looks at the available screens on the remote display and presents them on the Intel X server as VIRTUAL1, VIRTUAL2, etc.\nThe following script (run as root) works for me, but most likely you'll need to tweak things:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Power on the nvidia card with bumblebee.\nmodprobe bbswitch\necho ON > /proc/acpi/bbswitch\n\n# Run X display :8 on the nvidia card.\noptirun true\n\n# Tell the intel card to create virtual screens on :0 and\n# copy whatever they're displaying to equivalent screens on :8\nintel-virtual-output\n\n# Configure my monitors the way I like them.\nxrandr --output VIRTUAL3 --auto\nxrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --auto --right-of VIRTUAL3\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off\n\nThis setup enables my DisplayPort to DVI cable (VIRTUAL3) on the left and the VGA (VIRTUAL1) on the right. It also disables the laptop screen.\nNote that since these are just virtual screens from the driver, in theory your GUI's display configuration tool should be able to figure it out after you've run intel-virtual-output.\nIn practice, the display configuration tool in xubuntu did not really do coherent things. That's why those xrandr commands are there. If you're running gnome or kde it might be worth trying the GUI tool before messing with xrandr. Otherwise, before you run this you'll probably want to tweak some things for whatever setup you're actually using. Running just xrandr tells you what displays are currently connected. You can connect and disconnect your monitors to see which plug connects to which VIRTUAL[0-9] display. The laptop screen is LVDS1. Then it's just a matter of doing the xrandr commands with --right-of, --left-of, --below, etc. to get things in their proper place.\nWhen you want to go mobile again you can run this (again, as root):\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Turn on the laptop screen.\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --auto\n\n# Turn off my the other screens.\nxrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --off\nxrandr --output VIRTUAL3 --off\n\n# Kill the xorg server running on the nvidia card.\nkill $(ps ax | grep Xorg | grep :8 | awk '{print $1}')\n\n# Wait plenty of time for it to die.\nsleep 5\n\n# Remove the nvidia kernel module so we can shut down the card.\n# If you're running another driver this might be something different.\nrmmod nvidia\n\n# Use bumblebee to turn off the nvidia card and save power.\necho OFF > /proc/acpi/bbswitch\n\nI'm running xubuntu 14.04 using the proprietary nvidia driver version 337.25. I've also got bumblebee packages from https://launchpad.net/~bumblebee/+archive/ubuntu/stable.\nInterestingly, this setup is the reverse of the usual Optimus setup. Usually you're selectively running programs on the nvidia card and copying buffers from the nvidia card to the intel card which actually talks to the monitors. In this case you're running everything on the intel card and copying the relevant screen buffers to the nvidia card.\nIf you're wondering, yes, this makes it hard to run nvidia accelerated applications. I've not yet figured out a way to make games perform well, and even with HD video it slows down over time. It even appears to not be double-buffering because you get visible left-right top-down scanning after playing fairly high-resolution video for a while. That said, most projectors will probably be fine.\n\nA: Maybe try this.\nBut is dependent on hardwiring.\n", "Q: How to empty GDM log files?

Here is a link about chkdsk:-http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/chkdsk.mspx?mfr=true As you will see from the link, there is an option to use chkdsk with the /r parameter, which will let chkdsk fix any errors found.\nAnother useful approach is to use the linux tool gparted but from a live CD or a live usb. Here is a link : http://gparted.sourceforge.net/liveusb.php The advantage is that you get to examine the hard disk in isolation. You boot off the cd or usb memory stick, run gparted and then you will be able to check the partitions from menu Partition-->>check. Also, of course, you would be able to shrink the windows partition(s) to leave unformatted space at the end for Ubuntu to install into. If feeling adventurous you could create the Ubuntu partitions prior to a manual install, but that would be another question.\nI suppose one further possibility is that your Ubuntu install disc is faulty, rare but possible.....

I recently switched to  GNOME 3 and was surprised to find that there was no way by which we could set the default applications. I am writing a Nautilus extension using Bash. I want to find the MIME type of a file. \nInitially I used to extract the extension of the file using sed and build the code on it. Then I realized that there is this command called file. When I try to find the mime-type of a mkv file, the command file --mime-type -b <filename> outputs application/octet-stream but when I see the Nautilus properties window it shows the correct video/x-matroska mime-type. \nAm I missing anything here? If not is there a better way in which I can file the mime-type of a file?\n\nA: There are different ways to get a MIME type on Linux, and they often lead to different results.  Use\nxdg-mime query filetype your_file\n\nto get the same MIME type as Nautilus gets.\n\nA: Look up the .desktop file of the application (i.e. gedit) in /usr/share/applications and add the MIME-Types as following:\n...\nMimeType=text/plain;text/wiki;text/foo;\n...\n\nThey should then be automatically launched on these files.\n", "Q: How do I go back in the browser?

Unfortunately this requiers building it from source and also removing ALSA, PulseAudio from your Ubuntu and setting applications backends to OSSv4.\nYou should post the output of lspci -v command (run it in terminal) for audio device section. When you will know what's your soundcard then you can check if it is supported by Open Sound System.\nUbuntu community documentation regarding OpenSound has commands for removing ALSA (reboot requiered) and of course installation of OSSv4 (including compiling from source). There is also the official guide regarding that process. Before you start the compilation open up software-properties-gtk application as root and check the source code on the first tab. Then update your software sources and run this command: \nsudo apt-get build-dep oss4-base\n\nYou should change configure script GRC_MAX_QUALITY=3 to GRC_MAX_QUALITY=6 that's for production quality resampler. Know you can build the .deb package.\nWhen all that is done than it's time for configuring applications. You can also emulate ALSA for applications that doesn't support OSSv4 edit /etc/asound.conf or .asoundrc as per instructions on Arch Linux OSSv4 Wiki.\n\nA: Did you check the settings in the audio control panels for output levels, etc to make sure none of them were set to an extreme?\nIs it the same computer with the same hardware?  Same source material?  If the source is on a mounted NTFS drive, it might be a good idea to copy it to your Linux home directory to make sure there's no funny business along the way.\nI realize that music quality is hard to quantify for normal listeners, so telling you it sounds good to me won't help (although I did work at Dolby Labs evaluating new audio designs for many years before getting into programming).  Also, I have several audio players, but not Audacious.  I usually use VLC, Clementine, or Banshee, depending on what I'm doing.\nMy ears aren't perfect, but I can tell the difference between 128 kbs encoding, and higher with mp3.  I don't normally listen critically on my PC, so I just tried using headphone with some decent quality MP3 files, and they were not distorted.  This is with an older, fairly cheap home-built computer with built-in audio.\n\nA: Before switching to Ubuntu I was also worried, I had a very nice setup in Windows using Foobar + ASIO.\nI agree that out of the box the Ubuntu sound was average, it sounded a bit muffled. \nHowever the solution was even more simple than on Windows, and the results are better :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:me-davidsansome/clementine\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install clementine\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-alsa\n\nThe above will install Clementine music player + ALSA. Then you need to reboot for ALSA to be available. In Clementine, go to Tools/ Preferences/ General / Audio Playback / and under Gstreamer engine, select Audio sink (ALSA).\nThis is the Ubuntu equivalent of Foobar + ASIO, but even better because if you switch programs you can listen to a youtube video while pausing a track, which is not possible in Windows Asio. \n", "Q: No Internet 10.04 Here's my story, short as possible:\nIt all started two years ago when two laptops with Windows became unusable.

I use gedit to edit files on my Media Temple server, but it's so laggy. Other editors I've used don't have this problem.\nSaving takes a long time, and gedit usually freezes up for a bit during this. Navigating through a file is also slow and problematic. \n\nA: If it helps I use GoDaddy Hosting and work with some people in a serverloft dedicated server. In both I get good connections and bad connections depending the time of day or if I am sharing the connection with someone. If My ISP lines are saturated or if somebody else is sharing the same connection as me can lag when trying not only to find the file in the ftp site but also opening and editing it. Even saving it takes a lot when on peek hours.\nI am using the default way of accessing the ftp site which is the nautilus \"Connect to server\" option. After that I double click a PHP or JS file to open it with gedit and start working on it.\nIf nobody else is sharing I tend to have good timing. Even better in night when there is less ISP users and my connections makes the ftp feel like is right beside me.\nBut anyhow, there are variables between connection sharing, isp speed and all the hops between there to media temple. I also gotta say that even though media temple has pretty good reviews and very nice service I did not find them better than lets say godaddy when it came to how good the connection is made. Used them for 2 years before going to godaddy and have not found a difference regarding speed. At least in my region.\nTo add to this, I used filezilla just to test out if the ftp had the same \"feeling\" as connecting via nautilus. It was the same. Also tried cute ftp from windows. All of which had the same speed. I even opened my FTP site from another friends place. Same thing.\nIf I had to recommend something, I would say to update your Ubuntu with the latest updates just in case. Maybe even ping your site and if you can ping another site to see any difference. If a big ping difference is found, you might try to use the other sites ftp just to test out the theory behind this. Basically a Trial and Error kind of thing.\n", "Q: How can I install Docky 2.2?

How can I remove the My Computer, Home Folder, and Trash icons from my desktop?\n\nA: I am assuming you are using Ubuntu 11.10? If you go to the software center you can download \"advanced settings\" which will allow you to turn on and off those desktop icons. I don't know why they are on there, as I thought on default the desktop doesn't have any icons, but rather they are on the unity bar.\n", "Q: Installing basic Gnome GUI on server I'm trying to install a very minimal Gnome environment on an Ubuntu server running on minimal server hardware (i.e. no graphics card) behind a KVM switch. Yes, I know that's generally frowned upon.

In /etc/postfix/main.cf I have [relayhost = smtp.someisp.no] and everything works fine. I have to use this relayhost since my ISP has closed port 25. My ISP tells me that if I dont want to use their relayhost I have to configure my mailserver to use a ssl port like port 465. Then I can remove the relayhost option. Do anyone know where I do this like which files to edit and is this possible if I dont set up my server as a DNS Server?\n\nA: It sounds like you're talking about two different things.\nIf you need to configure a relayhost, it is because outgoing access to port 25 has been blocked by your ISP.  Given that the mail servers listen on port 25 by convention, you will almost certainly have to use a relay host of some variety.\nMy guess as to what the person at the help desk was suggesting was that if you wanted to contact a particular mail server outside the ISP's firewalls, then that mail server should be configured to listen on a second port.  Some reasons you might want to do this is if your company required that all mail be sent via their servers, or you'd set up restrictive SPF rules such that mail sent via your ISP would be rejected.  One thing to keep in mind here though, is that this would just be trading one relay host for another.\nIf you don't have such an external mail server in mind, then the suggestion about changing the port doesn't really apply.  In that case, relaying via your ISP's mail server is probably the best option.\n", "Q: Dual Boot: access Mac OS HD folders from Ubuntu I did it!!! I'm right now writting from Ubuntu 11.10 installed in my MacBook Pro using Dual Boot!!!\nTHe only thing is, how can I now access my Mac folders? From Ubuntu if I try to open Music, Documents or any of those folders related to the Mac user I get the following:\n[The folder contents could not be displayed.\nYou do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of \"Music\"]\nI can access them if I run Nautilus from root (gksudo nautilus), but I would like to just be able to browse those folders.\nThanks!\n\nA: just launch nautilus as root :\ngksudo nautilus\nthis will give you access to osx files from ubuntu\nor from a terminal open up a root shell :\n\nsudo -s;\ncd /media\nenjoy - Scott Stensland\n\nA: One solution is to use the command line in OS X and chmod the directories to 777 (or 755 if you just want read permissions).  \nOpen the Terminal in OS X.  Type ls and you should see a list of your folders like Music, Documents, etc.  Now say you want to change the permissions on Music so you can read and write to it in Ubuntu.  Type:\nchmod -R 777 Music\n\nThe -R is there to recursively change permissions on everything contained within Music.   You would use 755 if you are fine just accessing Music, but didn't want to be able to add or delete files to the Music directory from Ubuntu.   \nThat works for reading and accessing them.  You will not be able to write to them however unless you disable journaling on the OS X partition, which you can do either from the command line or in Disk Utility (click on the OS X partition, then hold down option key while clicking \"File\" menu to enable \"disable journaling\" option).  The reason for this limitation is explained in this other thread.\nActually there is a way to keep journaling on and write to that partition, but you would need to install hfsprogs, see this for further details.\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, I guess I would say there's no urgent need for the journaling.  It's good to have it, but it wasn't even introduced into the consumer version of OS X until 10.3.  Were Mac users using 10.2 in great danger?  If you experience frequent unexpected shutdowns or power losses, then I'd definitely turn it on though.\nAlso, you might wonder why people bother changing the UID instead of just changing permissions.  This is because changing permissions allows other users on your computer to now access those folders.  If you're on a personal laptop where you're the only user, this shouldn't be an issue (unless you let other people log in remotely for some reason).  If you do let other (untrusted) persons use your computer and you don't want them to access the information in those folders with the changed permissions, you should consider the UID route.   \n\nA: I'm assuming it has to do with permissions. Boot into OSX and go to the folders that you want access to and allow r/w access to any user. I'm not positive this will solve it, but it might.\n", "Q: Samba Share Issues Ok, so I have added two users to samba, user1 and user2.\nI've also added a couple of different shares, with different path locations.\nI am connecting from a Windows XP machine. User1 can connect to all shares with the proper username and password.\nWhen trying to connect to those same shares with User2's usernames and password, I can't connect to any share, only the home directory.\nCan someone lend some assistance to this?\n\nA: I am assuming that those same shared resources that User1 has access to might not have permissions for User2.\nWhat I recommend is going to this shared resources and adding permissions for User2. This should fix the problem which is a very common one that all people (me) do it some time (all the time for me).\nSome ideas might be adding both users to a same group that has access to this same resources.\nTo add for example user \"user2\" to group \"user1\" you might use something like this:\nuseradd -aG user1 user2 - Where user1 is the group name and user2 is the user name.\nRemember that when using adminstrative commands, you need to prefix them with the command sudo. For example, the above would be sudo useradd -aG user1 user2\nAnother tip to help and check quickly would be to allow complete access. This is just a test to see if the problem is permissions. For example if you external unit is mounting in /media/My Passport 1 you would do something like this sudo chmod 777 \"/media/My Passport 1\". Why the double quotes you may ask. this is because My Passport 1 has spaces between it. This is a quick and dirty way but other ways like /media/My\\ Passport\\ 1 also exist.\nI also recommend opening the GUI tool \"Disk utility\" and changing the label from \"My Passport 1\" to a one word name, like \"Stuff\" or \"Photos\". Open the DASH many and type disk. It should bring an icon called Disk Utility. Open it and from there you should find your drive, change the label from the one you have to a shorter, easier one.\n", "Q: Running Xen on Ubuntu-Server 11.10 I'm trying to run Xen on Ubuntu Server 11.10. I tried following the wiki, but it's a bit obsolete, so I tried following a blog post. Everything seemed to be going well, until I ran virsh version, which shows:\nCompiled against library: libvir 0.9.2\nUsing library: libvir 0.9.2\nUsing API: Xen 3.0.1\nCannot extract running Xen hypervisor version\n\nOddly, when I booted, I manually selected the Xen kernel...but then a second Grub menu appeared, requiring I select a \"normal\" Ubuntu kernel.\nAlso, when I ran grep vmx /proc/cpuinfo, it showed my CPU (an Intel Xeon E3-1230) had VT support. But now when I run it, it doesn't show anything, which is weird because Intel's docs explicitly say it has VT support.\nHow do I determine what went wrong and fix it? Is there an official guide on installing Xen on Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: I think you might have to be root to start talking to the xm binary. Does sudo virsh version offer different output? my response is based off the following post.\nhttp://open.eucalyptus.com/forum/cannot-run-instance-1#comment-20099\nHaving said all that, unless you have a legacy application that requires Xen I would suggest you migrate to KVM. It's just all round better supported on Ubuntu. Good luck.\n\nA: You shouldn't be getting a second grub menu.  If you install the xen package, it adds the xen entries to the grub menu, and when you choose the xen option, the system should just appear to boot normally.  You can then use the xm command to start additional xen domains.  The reason you don't see the vmx support is because xen is using it, so it doesn't reveal it to the virtual machines running under xen.\n", "Q: Horizontal Scrolling checked but still doesn't work I have an Asus N82JV with touchpad configured for single tap, double tap and two-finger vertical scroll. Even though I have the \"Enable horizantal scrolling\" in the mouse configurations it still doesn't work.\nAny idea how to fix? Thanks.\n\nA: The challenge you are facing is likely caused by the fact that while many touchpads enable horizontal scrolling, they often do not have a large enough area for the scrolling to actually be detected. There used to be a program for changing this value, but I don't think it is supported any longer.\nOf course, that is only one possible explanation, and it may just be that your touchpad doesn't support it in the first place, which is more likely the problem.\nEDIT:\nFrom the information you gave, it would seem that either the driver in Linux is missing support for horizontal scrolling, or it is using the wrong configuration for your hardware. In either case, you should report a bug.\n", "Q: Accessing External HDD So I have 2 external hdd's mounted.

I recently reinstalled Ubuntu. I opened Firefox preferences and tried to add my sync account.\nI selected the option saying I didn't have my device with me, and proceeded. Next I entered my details and saw that something called a 'recovery key' was needed. I didn't remember seeing this before (and I've been using sync since it was called weave), so I clicked \"Don't remember\" and then \"Generate new key\".\nIt said it was succesful and that it would start syncing. But none of my data came through. I started getting worried. I searched the Internet and found this http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Replace%20your%20Sync%20information.\nSo it looks like all my years of data online has been removed without warning me. Sure, I should have backed up the data (and in fact I do have an older backup), but this still shouldn't happen without warning me. It's a big shock.\nHas this happened to anyone else? Is there anything I can do about this?\n\nA: Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about this. The key is what is needed to read your otherwise encrypted data, and there is no way around it. Even the Mozilla Foundation, that maintains the firefox sync servers, can't access your data without said key.\nSuch a mechanism is incredibly useful, as it guarantees you that nobody other than you will be able to look at your data. The downside is that, if you fail to keep the key, you lose all your data without any possibility of recovering it.\nI would suggest that you write down your new key in a safe location, in case such a thing happens again. Keeping good backups is also essential.\n", "Q: How do I give permission to a basic user to access read, execute contents of only one partition but not delete or ad files How do I give permission to a basic user to access read, execute contents of only one partition but not delete or ad files ...\nI have 3 partitions , and the one I want to give access is dev/sda4 . \nEvery time I try to mount disc it requires authentication.\n\nA: First thing is first, Reading/Writing/Deleting from a filesystem on a partition are managed by a different set of permissions than mounting a filesystem on a partition. So you will need two fixes, at the minimum, to solve your problem.\nRelevant to Both Fixes\ninside of the file /etc/fstab there may or may not be a line starting with /dev/sda4. Alternatively there may or may not be a line starting with the UUID of that partition. You can find the UUID by running ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid and looking for the one that points to /dev/sda4.\nIf there isn't a line, then you'll need to make one. Either way, the general form of the line should be: \nUUID=(hex chars) /mntdir        filesystem    options      0       0\n#or\n/dev/sda4        /mntdir        filesystem    options      0       0\n\nThe part of the line you want to focus on is the options section. \nFix #1, Relevant if your filesystem is FAT/NTFS\nIf your filesystem doesn't play nice with linux permissions, then you can use the umask option to control the type of access to the files. On NTFS-3G, umask=0022 sets the user file permissions to 0755 which is rwxr-xr-x. gid controls what group the default permissions apply to. So for example, you can make a group called ntfsusers and add all users to that group and then set umask=0002 See the Arch Wiki link for more.\n#Example NTFS line:\n/dev/sda4 /mntdir ntfs gid=users,umask=0002,user,rw,auto 0   0\n\nFix #2, Mounting the driver as a normal user\nThe user and nouser options control who can mount the filesytem.  When user is present any user can mount the drive. When nouser is present only root can mount the drive. user turns on a few other flags by default, see the link at the bottom of this post.\n#Example NTFS line:\n/dev/sda4 /mntdir ext3 defaults,user 0   0\n\nWikipedia on /etc/fstab: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab\nTuxfiles on /etc/fstab: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html\nArch-Wiki on NTFS-3G options: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NTFS-3G#Allowing_Group.2FUser\n", "Q: \"Failed to start network default\" error when trying to juju bootstrap an LXC environment one@onezero:~/juju$ juju bootstrap\n2012-02-13 07:32:26,586 INFO Bootstrapping environment 'sample' (type: local)...\n2012-02-13 07:32:26,587 INFO Checking for required packages...\n2012-02-13 07:32:26,981 INFO Starting networking...\nerror: Failed to start network default\nerror: internal error Network is already in use by interface virbr0\n\nCommand '['virsh', 'net-start', 'default']' returned non-zero exit status 1\n2012-02-13 07:32:27,248 ERROR Command '['virsh', 'net-start', 'default']' returned non-zero exit status 1\n\nwith sudo \none@onezero:~/juju$ sudo juju bootstrap\n2012-02-13 07:34:18,504 INFO Bootstrapping environment 'sample' (type: local)...\n2012-02-13 07:34:18,504 INFO Checking for required packages...\n2012-02-13 07:34:18,894 INFO Starting networking...\n2012-02-13 07:34:18,931 INFO Starting zookeeper...\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/zookeeper/conf/environment'\n2012-02-13 07:34:18,932 ERROR [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/zookeeper/conf/environment'\n\nhow do i fix this error ?\n\nA: \nThis happens because you're likely not a member of the libvirtd\n  group.

In my .bashrc file I have defined PATH variable, but it seems it's not validated by desktop launchers\nWhere should I define PATH variable so that launchers can pick it up?\n\nA: PATH variable can be defined in ~/.profile file, instead ~/.bashrc so that it will be available to launchers\n\nA: Follow below step to define path variable available for all launcher for manually installed JDK \nStep:\n1- \n cd /etc/\n\n2-  \nsudo vim ~/.profile\n\n3- Add below codes in your step2 open file\n  PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/lib:$PATH\"\n\n  JAVA_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_79\"\n\n  export JAVA_HOME\n\n  PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin\n\n  export PATH\n\n4-Restart your system\n\nA: The PATH set in .bashrc is only called when you open a new instance of bash (i.e. opening a gnome-terminal.

In mine (stock 11.10) it looks like:\n# some more ls aliases\nalias ll='ls -alF'\nalias la='ls -A'\nalias l='ls -CF'\n\nAdd the following line after the ls aliases:\nalias ls='ls -1'\n\nSave the file, exit gedit and the terminal and reboot. Now the ls command should execute ls -1 by default.\n\nA: Just to clarify something to @RobDavenport answer. You can't use a function to override a command that has the same name.\ne.g. to add a default param to the ls command you can do :\nalias ls='ls -1 $@'\n\nThis will add a new alias called ls so it will be called instead of the original command. It will add the -1 option and forward every parameter $@ to the original ls command.\nYou could also do \nfunction ls_column () {\n  ls -1 $@\n}\n\nIt would have the same effect but you must use a different name for your function. Otherwise it will call itself again and again.\n\nA: One way would be by creating alias in your ~/.bashrc file:\nalias l1='ls -1'\nthen by typing l1, ls -1 will be executed\n\nA: zetah's answer is the best.  To elaborate: \nAliases are best used for short, simple, often used modifications of command default parameters.  They are stored in memory (after being read from their source file), for better performance or repetitive use.\nFunctions are appropriate for more complex activity that are often used, and are also stored in memory.  \nScripts are appropriate for the most complex and least often used commands. \nSee this question and answers on unix stackexchange - explains the difference in best use between aliases, functions, and scripts.\n", "Q: Broadcom 4312 wireless not working on an HP dv6-1245 DX \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to Install Broadcom / STA Wireless card (BCM43XX) \n\nI have installed Ubuntu 10.04 on my HP dv6-1245 dx notebook and I do not have any wifi (it worked perfectly in windows vista and 7).

In this case it is the modem which will have an \"external\" IP-address, your computer will have a \"local\" address like 10.1.1.1 etc. In this case it's impossible to connect to your computer from the outside world unless you configured your modem to forward certain types of packets to a certain address in your internal network.\nSo, unless you have a \"real\" IP-address, the only practical possibility to get \"owned\" is to download something yourself, start it and give it your root password.

I have the most recent stable version installed (version 3.5.5375) but every time I try to apt-get install the codlite plugins it advises it will remove the codelite install.\n\nA: The codelite-plugins available in the Ubuntu repositories is older than the codelite version that you downloaded from their page. So you can't have both installed at the same time using the package manager.\nThe good news is that (in a superficial check) all the plugins available in the Ubuntu codelite-plugins deb, seems to be included in the codelite deb available from the official codelite page.\nNote that using the version from the repos has some advantages, like automated updates.\nThe short answer: No, you can't mix the Ubuntu codelite packages with the official packages.\n", "Q: How can I change the icon size on lubuntu's desktop?

I try to connect to 127.0.0.1:22 with the normal user name for the Ubuntu setup and it won't connect!\n\nA: You need to find what IP the guest is using.\nIf it's using Bridged networking, then it will have gotten an IP from your router and be on your network like any other device. [edit to add: bear in mind if you have no DHCP on your network, you'll have to handle the IP assignment yourself]\nIf it's using NAT, VirtualBox runs a dhcpd and assigns the guest an internal address.

Now I'm aware of how to unpack and how to pack the initrd with cpio and have even written a hook for /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks in the past to integrate a third-party kernel module. However, while the available script libraries seem to be geared towards the integration of modules, none of them seems to be for integration of other entities (in particular programs and their dependencies).\nWhat options do I have to automate the integration of some useful tools for recovery into the initrd? I'm talking about the \"rescue\" system that the system drops into if it is unable to mount the root drive given to it by the boot loader.\nPlease note that I don't want the SquashFS approach as is used for Live-CDs because for the issue at hand it will be by far sufficient to include some relatively small tools that aid in recovery of the system (when it gets stuck in initrd and can't boot further).

Pavilion DV7-6199US I bought a new HP Pavilion  DV7-6199US. In the past on all my computers I have always used Ubuntu primarily and I keep a version of Windows in case I need something that I can't do easily in Linux. I have always just re-sized the main Windows partition to leave enough space for Linux to run with no problems. I would leave the remaining space for Linux on the disk with no partition or anything, just unused space. Then I would run Ubuntu's installer and tell it to use the unused space. Never a problem, Ubuntu would create partitions there however it wanted to.\nThis time I did all this, but when I resized the partition in Windows the remaining space was labelled unusable by Linux and Windows. So I said OK no problem I booted Ubuntu 11.10 from USB and I just deleted the whole Windows partition and created a 492 GB partition to install Windows on again.\nAfter doing this the Disk Management Utility in Ubuntu said the following error: \"Warning: The partition is misaligned by 3072 bytes. This may result in very poor performance. Repartitioning is suggested.\" Do I keep going? Is this just a screwy error that I can ignore? I can't handle bad performance issues.\nI'm not very experienced with the command line so GUI-only unless you can really be patient with me, please.\n\nA: The older hard drives used smaller 512-byte sectors; recently newer drives use larger sectors, usually 4096 bytes.\nSoftware, however, is still sees the disk in 512-byte \"logical\" sectors, although it often reads the data in 4K chunks\nWhen creating a partition, it is important to align the beginning of the partition with the beginning of the large physical sector, otherwise each read will require reading 2 physical sectors, which will affect performance.\nAs you can see, your partition starts from logical sector #3 (#1 and #2 take 512*2=1024 bytes), so to fix the problem you need to move the start of the partition by 3072 (4096-1024) bytes.\nNewer versions of gparted are aware of this - just boot from Ubuntu LiveCD and create a new partition selecting the default alignment option (which is \"align to 1 MB\", which is optimal even for larger sector size, such as in SSDs).\nIf you already installed OS and do not want to re-create partitions, you could move the start of the partitions to align properly, but that would involve some pen-and-paper calculations. Also, you'll need to reinstall the bootloader if you moved Ubuntu partition.\n", "Q: How to make Firefox use chromify-osd? I understand that Chrome has chromify-osd, an extension that lets it use notify-osd for notifications. Is it possible to customize it such that it works for Firefox as well?\n\nA: There is a script made by Marco Ceppi and modified by George Edison that allows Firefox to use Notify-OSD. \nFor Firefox to use Notify-OSD, you need to have Greasemonkey extension installed in Firefox. After that, you need to download this script. \nYou also have to download NPAPI plugin and copy them to your ~/.mozilla/plugins/ folder and restart the browser. \nAfter all that, run the following command in a terminal: \nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnotify.so.4 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnotify.so.1\n\nYou now should have Firefox using Notify-OSD for displaying notifications.\n\nA: The short answer is: no.\nA slightly longer answer is that Chrome extensions will not work with Firefox, and vice-versa. You can however look for a Firefox extension that does more or less the same job, but I haven't heard of one similar to chromify-osd.\n", "Q: Unable to run apps requiring OpenGL support Recently upgraded my onboard Nvidea graphics chip with an ATI Radeon Sapphire X800XL  PCIe graphics card.

I'm using Openbox (because the gnome3 GNOME shell and Unity were both making me c-r-a-z-y, not because I don't have hardware) and want to install a dock. I've heard good things about Docker and Docky both, but I don't know how to activate either. I'm running Gnome-do already and installed Docker. Now what?\n\nA: In you home directory there is a folder .config inside is another folder for Openbox.\nInside it create a file titled autostart, put what ever commands you want Openbox to run in it.\nDo NOT mark it executable.\nIt works just like a sh script. I use mine to run zenity, and give me a dialog box to choose a session. These sessions can be anything you like idesk, Cairo Dock, Docky, Steam big picture mode, or whatever your little heart desires, but remember this isn't a shell script it just works similarly.\nIf you want to use it in this manner you have to make other scripts to compliment it, such as a separate script to load everything for Docky, and another one for Cairo Dock, Steam etc.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get the wallpaper to \"tile\" instead of \"center\"?

Is there any way to get it to lock the wallpaper to the top (without stretching it)?\n\nA: I believe the best thing you can do is automatically adjust the size such that it forces the tile setting to behave as desired. This can be done with GIMP.\n\nA: On an old IBM with a resolution of 1024X768.\nThe wallpaper resolution is 1440X900.\nWhat I did is just a right click on the desktop -> Change background -> Choose fit to screen. \nThis will center the Wallpaper, however it will also stretch it if they are not the same proportion.\n", "Q: Dual Boot: Ubuntu using 3 times more battery than Leopard? Just a quick question: I have noticed when I boot into Ubuntu my battery goes empty faster, and checking the \"time left\" option in Leopard and Ubuntu it says Mac will last 3 hours where Ubuntu will last 1.\nIs that normal?????\n\nA: I would say battery life issues are not uncommon with specialized hardware.  Particularly with Apple laptops, you will find many such issues in the Ubuntu forums.  But the good news is usually you can tweak and adjust your laptop performance until it gets to pretty normal.\nFor example, with my Macbook Air, currently I get about 5 hours in OS X.  With similar usage, I found I got about one hour of battery life on 11.10.\nBut it turns out 11.10 has some power management issues due to the 3.0 kernel.  Supposedly 12.04 would fix that and I had a couple other issues anyway, so I upgraded to the alpha version.  After that, I got about 2 - 2.5 hours.  Then I learned about laptop-mode-tools (given how useful people find this, it's amazing this is not part of the default install for laptops...).  Now I find I get about 4 hours.  So I'm satisfied.\nI've made a comparison of watts used and clearly Ubuntu is just using more than OS X.  At idle, OS X is using 9-10 watts, while 12.04 is using 12-13.  Part of it is due to this mysterious \"display backlight\" issue I'm running into, which takes about 2-2.5 watts.  \nUpdate: Here's more info about laptop-mode-tools.  This is the website for it.  From its FAQ, if you want to check if it's running, type cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode at the command line; nonzero value means its running.  Also, the configuration file is at /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf.  To read the manual for it, type man laptop-mode.conf at the command line.  To alter the config file you will need to do it as root, e.g. gksu gedit /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf.  Be careful doing that!  If you want to disable it, to test your system, near the beginning of the file, you should see the option ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_TOOLS with the value of 1 -- change it to 0 and shutdown/restart.\n\nA: The real issue here is the graphic card, this part use a lot of power. Natively, the Leopard OS will manage and switch automatically between the more and the less powerful graphic card.\nOn Ubuntu, you will need to use a patch to be able to select which graphic card you want to use according to what you are doing.\nI hope it will help you and you will see some improvements.\n\nA: 3 times is a bit extreme. I suspect at least part of the difference may be due to the difference in algorithms estimating battery usage. Try running your laptop until the battery is dry with MacOS and Ubuntu - you may find that Ubuntu lasted 1.5 hours and MacOS lasted 2 - that would be more likely.\nI mean - I'm getting 1 hour of battery life with Ubuntu from a cheap 6-year old Compaq laptop... Apple must be making very bad hardware for it to last 1 hour :)\n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu 11.10 - CD with downloaded ISO file doesn't work I tried to install Ubuntu 11.10 on my DELL Studio XPS running with Windows 7 Professional. Following the recommended installation steps found on the internet, I first downloaded the ISO file, burned it on CD and restarted the system from this burned CD forced by pressing F12.\nNothing happened (black screen with blinking cursor) and after a while normal Windows 7 startup appeared. Finally I tried the 32bit as well as 64bit version with the same disappointing result.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: You may have burned the .iso file to the CD without actually burning the disk image to the disk.  When you open the CD in a folder in Windows, it should look like the CD contains multiple folders. If it looks like the disk contains a single .iso file, you'll need to try again.\nUbuntu's community documentation has good instructions for burning an iso to a disk. Assuming you're burning the CD in Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the open source Infra Recorder software\n\n*With a blank disk in the drive, open Infra Recorder and click the Burn Image button\n\n*Choose the Ubuntu .iso file that you downloaded and burn that image to the disk.\n\n\nA: Maybe you just have to set your CD/DVD drive as your first boot priority in your BIOS.\nGetting to the BIOS config screen varies from motherboard to motherboard, but its ussually done by pressing either DEL or the F2, once there you should go into the boot section, and alter your boot priority to use the CD/DVD ROM drive as the primary boot device.\n\nA: The only other thing these guys haven't covered is making sure the md5sum is correct and not mismatched. \nTake a look here for the proper check sums https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes\nI would also recommend burning at the slowest speed possible. \n", "Q: pingtest.net gives \"Packet Loss Test Error\" This is what I get when trying the pingtest.net on Ubuntu 11.10\nI don't have any firewall running on my router. Is there a firewall running on Ubuntu that I don't know about? \n\n\nA: Most consumer routers also perform NAT.  They also normally ignore pings by default.  You either can configure the router to respond to pings, or you may be able to configure the DMZ to forward the ping ( and everything else ) to your computer so it can respond.\n", "Q: How do I restart the SSH service? How do I stop/start ssh? I've tried \n/etc/init.d/ssh restart\nsudo service ssh restart\nsudo restart ssh\n\nI get errors every time.\n\nA: 15.04 and newer:\nUse this command:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh\n\nTo restart the SSH server/daemon.\nGoing forward with systemd starting with Ubuntu 15.04, you now use this syntax to stop, start, or restart services:\nsudo systemctl <action> <service-name>\n\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 15.04, Canonical no longer ships upstart by default.\nThus, the commands start, stop and restart are no longer available.\nThe correct method for restarting the SSH service (or any other service) now is one of the two following commands:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh\nsudo service ssh restart\n\n\nA: I think that the Unknown instance error is because SSH is not running.\nTry:\nps ax | grep sshd\n\nTo see if the SSH daemon is running or not, you should see something like:\n/usr/sbin/sshd -D\n\nIn any case, just try any of these:\nsudo /etc/init.d/ssh start\nsudo start ssh\n\nA: First check to see if sshd is running using the following:\nps -ef | grep sshd\n\nYou should see something like:\nroot      1234     1  0 12:28 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D\n\nIf you do not see a line for /usr/sbin/sshd -D then sshd was either never started or has crashed, which will require further troubleshooting to find out why.\nIf you do see that line, next run this:\ncat /var/run/sshd.pid\n\nThis should print the process id of sshd, so in this case you should see:\nuserid@computername:~$ cat /var/run/sshd.pid \n1234\n\nIf the contents of sshd.pid does not match the process id of the running instance of sshd then something has restarted it incorrectly.  But whatever the details you find here should put you on the right track.  Either it's crashing, being restarted incorrectly, or never being started in the first place.\n\nA: On Ubuntu Desktop:\nFirst check the status of the service:\nsudo service ssh status\n\n\nshould show: - Active: active (running) If it's running there's no need to restart it.\nIf you still want to restart it, Ubuntu calls the service ssh, not sshd.\nservice ssh restart\n\nBut if its not Ubuntu Desktop, using CLI:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nThe service is also controlled by upstart, and not sysvinit. So you'll find it at /etc/init/ssh.conf instead of /etc/init.d/ssh.\nIf you want to change some settings (e.g., the listening port, and root login permission) by editing the configuration file via command:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nOn Ubuntu desktop, you may use gedit instead of nano:\n\nFinally apply the changes by restarting or reloading SSH:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nIf above still doesn't work then, type this:\nsudo service ssh stop\nsudo service ssh start\n\nIf all above fails, try restarting your ubuntu system:\nsudo reboot -f\n\n\nA: Command for restart ssh service is:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\n\nA: Pre 15.04:\nIt should be as simple as (tested on a fresh install with openssh-server)\nsudo stop ssh\nsudo start ssh\n\nAs it leverages upstart, this is The Best Wayâ¢ to do it, rather than using /etc/init.d/ssh, service, or invoking sshd directly. Make sure to run both commands; if you get an error on stop ssh, start ssh anyway and see what it saysâthe service could already be stopped.\n(I would recommend stop/start over restart, unless you are trying to restart a system remotely. If ssh is already stopped, restart will not start it.) \nIf those commands don't work, you are probably either experiencing a bug or have tinkered too far with your system, in which case you at least know what the problem isn't.\n", "Q: Is there a way to completely remove \"recently used\" from open and save dialogs?

In case anyone still cares about this (and also for myself, because a recent upgrade allowed it to slip back in), I've created a patch (http://pastebin.com/VE4STB6M) to fix this annoying misfeature. The patched gtk will still show \"Recently Used\" in dialogs, but it will not be selected in the dialogs by default (it will default to the last directory used or to your home directory). For me, this fixes the problem, because my main gripe was having it pop up in my face, especially when trying to save something.\nStep by step instructions:\n1) Open a terminal window and enter the following commands:\nmkdir recently_used_fix\ncd recently_used_fix/\nsudo apt-get build-dep gtk+2.0\napt-get source gtk+2.0\nwget -O deselect_recently_used.patch http://pastebin.com/download.php?i=VE4STB6M\npatch -p0 < deselect_recently_used.patch\ncd gtk+2.0-2.24.10/\necho jlj | dpkg-source --commit\nsudo dpkg-buildpackage\ncd ..\n2) Close any package managers (such as Synaptic) and enter the following command in the terminal window:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n3) If the dpkg -i command gives errors about overwriting a handful of existing files (changelogs and such), use sudo rm FILENAME to delete each file it complained about, then repeat step 2. I noticed --force-overwrite doesn't seem to work for that, for whatever reason.\n4) Optional: Once the packages are successfully installed, use Synaptic to pin/hold (Package > Lock Version) each installed package, to avoid having to go through all this again (of course you would also miss any security updates).\n5) Close and re-open any affected apps (pluma, gedit, gimp, etc) and enjoy your annoyance-free open/save dialogs!\n6) Optional: Enter the following commands in the terminal window to remove the files and directories we created (the fix will remain installed):\ncd ..\nsudo rm -rf recently_used_fix/\nIn case the patch cannot be downloaded, here is a backup copy:\n\n--- gtk+2.0-2.24.10/gtk/gtkfilechooserdefault.c 2011-11-08 10:20:20.000000000 -0700\n+++ Downloads/gtk/gtk+2.0-2.24.10/gtk/gtkfilechooserdefault.c   2012-07-10 17:20:38.000000000 -0700\n@@ -5971,10 +5971,18 @@ gtk_file_chooser_default_map (GtkWidget\n\n   if (impl->operation_mode == OPERATION_MODE_BROWSE)\n     {\n+      GFile *folder;\n+\n       switch (impl->reload_state)\n         {\n         case RELOAD_EMPTY:\n-     recent_shortcut_handler (impl);\n+          /* The user didn't explicitly give us a folder to display, so we'll\n+           * use the saved one from the last invocation of the file chooser\n+           */\n+          folder = get_file_for_last_folder_opened (impl);\n+          gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder_file (GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (impl), folder, NULL);\n+          g_object_unref (folder);\n+     /* recent_shortcut_handler (impl); */\n           break;\n\n         case RELOAD_HAS_FOLDER:\n@@ -6005,8 +6013,8 @@ gtk_file_chooser_default_unmap (GtkWidge\n\n   settings_save (impl);\n\n-  cancel_all_operations (impl);\n-  impl->reload_state = RELOAD_EMPTY;\n+  /* cancel_all_operations (impl);\n+  impl->reload_state = RELOAD_EMPTY; */\n\n   GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (_gtk_file_chooser_default_parent_class)->unmap (widget);\n }\n\n\nA: It is literally impossible to do it, as the code related to that is hard-coded into the gedit codebase.\nThis is the relevant gedit commit message related to this change in the Gedit code-\nhttp://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=ca74dc6a873bb375bb2abc3ea7642ed41e9f6e79\nCourtesy:http://tstarling.com/blog/2011/11/file_chooser_recent/\nSo, unless someone changes the code for this and alter it to a user settable setting, I'm sorry to say that there seems no direct way out. \n\nA: I think this is what you are looking for:\nhttp://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/how-to-delete-and-disable-recent-history-in-ubuntu-tip/\nTo delete recent history, open the Terminal and enter the commands below:\nrm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite\nzeitgeist-daemon --replace\n\nTo prevent new items from being created, use these commands:\necho -n > ~/.recently-used.xbel\nsudo chattr +i ~/.recently-used.xbel\n\nYou can revert the changes to enable logging again by using the following Terminal command:\nsudo chattr -i ~/.recently-used.xbel\n\nSome systems might store the recently used file in another location:\necho -n > ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\nsudo chattr +i ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\n\nA: I dont know if this will do exactly what u need but i think it might solve your issue.\nYou need a software called Activity Log Manager\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:zeitgeist/ppa \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install activitylogmanager\n\nFind activity Log manager in the dash and run it.\nFurther Information is available at OMG Ubuntu!\n\nA: This is a three-years' old thread, but it seems like the GTK2 peeps made it a configuration option.\nGo into ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini, and set StartupMode=cwd.

The tty2 screen is now asking for a username/password pair to access tty2 which is NOT ubuntu:{no-password}. Please not that in the past that tty[1-4] were non GUI (tty1 was for dmesg logging for errors thrown while installing, however tty[2-4] were usually available to the user to access the command line, tty7 was generally set aside as the graphical interface for the installer up through 16.x while 17.x and newer moved the graphical installer screen to tty1) and defaulted to a sh/bash or similar command shell without any username/password login. As there is a definite use for having access to the command line while installing I would recommend a check that this is indeed the desired action to have while the installer is running.\nFurther testing of usernames failed to allow me into the terminal. Usernames I tried were and yet all listed below failed the username/password check.\n  root:root\n  root:{no-password}\n  ubuntu:{no-password}\n  ubuntu:ubuntu\n  Ubuntu:{no-password}\n  Ubuntu:Ubuntu\n\nA: I got around this issue by moving the mouse around until it completed its boot cycle.  It looks like the screen is locking, that is why it wants the password.  By continuously moving the mouse, the screen never locked.\nPerhaps the Ubuntu devs should consider changing the setting so that the screen does not lock or it does not require a password when it is locked.\n\nA: In my case, the Kubuntu screen was locked (showing that name: \"Live Session User\") and an empty password did not work there. I read another answer and followed those steps:\nIn your tty2 (Ctrl+Alt+F2), log in as: user kubuntu with an empty password. Type loginctl unlock-session [id], where [id] is the session id you get by typing loginctl list-sessions.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1 and check that the screen is unlocked, press Ctrl+Alt+F2 if the screen is locked.

Ubuntu 18.04 ufw and nfs-kernel-server.\nJust use this command to allow nfs on your host\nsudo ufw allow from your_client_ip to any port nfs\n\nor\nsudo ufw allow from your_client_ip_block/24 to any port nfs\n\n\nA: I did some more research into this. Ubuntu is using the UFW, which is extremely easy to configure, yet very potent, at least for soho needs. So, the rpc.mountd listens on multiple ports by default thus you have to bind rpc.mountd to one port, then you can add an additional UFW rule to accept incoming connection on that particular port.\nTo do so, open /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server and comment out the line\nRPCMOUNTDOPTS=--manage-gids\n\nand add the following line\nRPCMOUNTDOPTS=\"-p 13025\"\n\n13025 is just a randomly selected port, something that is available and isn't already defined in /etc/services.\nRestart NFSd with sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart\nNow configure the UFW to accept incoming connections on port 13025, 2049 and port 111.\nufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 111\nufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 2049\nufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 13025\n\nThat's it. You should now be able to mount your exports form another machine. :-)\n\nA: Accepted answer is correct for old versions of Ubuntu. But now I am using Ubuntu 22, and after trying this option (was working fine in my previous ubuntus on my raspberry pi) seems that is not valid any more.\nAccording to this link.\n\nthe /etc/default/nfs-* files are ignored by the NFS server or client\nin Ubuntu 22.04.\n\nThat means that the proposed solution of @Jar is not longer valid.\nWhat must be done now, is editing /etc/nfs.conf and according to this link. Update this config:\n[mountd]\n#port=0\n\nUncommenting the line #port=0 and replacing the port with the desired number (i.e. 13025 following the other examples).\n[mountd]\nport=13025\n\nAfter this, restart the server:\nsystemctl restart nfs-serve\n\nAnd ensure that the port 13025 now is correctly opened with rpcinfo -p giving and output such as:\n   program vers proto   port  service\n    100000    4   tcp    111  portmapper\n    100000    3   tcp    111  portmapper\n    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper\n    100000    4   udp    111  portmapper\n    100000    3   udp    111  portmapper\n    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper\n    100005    1   udp  13025  mountd\n    100005    1   tcp  13025  mountd\n    100005    2   udp  13025  mountd\n    100005    2   tcp  13025  mountd\n    100005    3   udp  13025  mountd\n    100005    3   tcp  13025  mountd\n    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs\n    100003    4   tcp   2049  nfs\n\nNow must work as expected. Obviusly, remeber to open your firewall to the ports 2049, 111, 13025.

I've been trying to find the difference between using the dir and ls commands in terminal. I know ls is the traditional UNIX method of viewing the files in a directory, and that dir is the windows command prompt equivalent, but both commands work in terminal. \nIf I type in dir, it displays the files and folders in the directory, and if I type ls, it does the same, except with content highlighting. Both commands accept options (i.e. ls -a and dir -a both return all files and folders and hidden files. \nSo does anyone know what the difference is and why both dir and ls are used?\n\nA: dir and ls are part of coreutils and dir is almost the same as ls, just with different default options.\n\nThe GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system. These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.\n\ninfo dir says: \n\ndir is equivalent to ls -C -b; that is, by default files are listed\n  in columns, sorted vertically, and special characters are represented\n  by backslash escape sequences.\n\nOh and there is also vdir! info vdir says:\n\nvdir is equivalent to ls -l -b; that is, by default files are\n  listed in long format and special characters are represented by\n  backslash escape sequences.\n\nMost likely dir exists for backwards compatibility or due to historical reasons.\n\nA: The Relationship Between ls and dir\nls and dir are separate programs that behave similarly. As explained and referenced below, the purpose of dir is to provide a command like ls whose output does not vary depending on whether or not it is going to a terminal. To achieve this helpfully, dir must format its output in a way that is reasonable and useful both for viewing in a terminal and for writing to a file or pipe.\nThere are two common misconceptions about dir:\n\n\n*\n\n*Many people believe dir is an alias of ls, but that is not the case. Neither command is an alias of the other, and by default in Ubuntu, dir is not an alias at all. ls and dir are provided by separate, non-identical executables.\n\n*Many people believe dir exists for obscure historical reasons or to provide compatibility with some standard or some other OS. That is not the case either. ls behaves the way it does for compatibilty. dir, which doesn't have to be compatible because it's not a standard Unix command, behaves in an alternate way that the developers consider valuable in its own right and possibly even preferable.\n\n\nOK, but exactly how do ls and dir differ?\nBoth ls and dir list the contents of directories. Two specific differences in their default behaviors distinguish them.\n\n\n*\n\n*When its standard output is a terminal, ls lists filenames in vertically sorted columns (like ls -C). When its standard output is not a terminal (for example, a file or pipe), ls lists filenames one per line (like ls -1).\nWhether or not its standard output is a terminal, dir lists filenames in vertically sorted columns (like ls -C).\nFor both ls and dir, these defaults may be overridden by the --format= flag and by the -1, -C, -m, and -x flags, which abbreviate particular --format= options. See 10.1.4 General output formatting in the GNU coreutils reference manual for details.\n\n*When its standard output is a terminal and a filename to be listed contains control characters, ls prints ? instead of each control character (like ls -q). When its standard output is not a terminal, ls prints control characters as-is (like ls --show-control-chars).\nWhether or not its standard output is a terminal, when dir encounters a control character or any other character that would be interpreted specially if entered into a shell, it prints backslash sequences for the characters. This includes even relatively common characters like spaces. For example, dir will list an entry called Documents backups as Documents\\ backups. This is like ls -b.\nFor both ls and dir, these defaults may be overridden by the flags listed in 10.1.7 Formatting the file names in the GNU coreutils reference manual. This includes -b, -q, --quoting-style=, and some others.\nSources: ls invocation and dir invocation, in the GNU coreutils reference manual.\nWhy have dir?\nThe rationale for a separate dir utility is given in 4.5 Standards for Interfaces Generally of the GNU coding standards. I recommend reading that whole section to understand the developers' reasoning, but here are the highlights as applicable to ls/dir:\n\nPlease donât make the behavior of a utility depend on the name used to\n  invoke it....\nInstead, use a run time option or a compilation switch or both to\n  select among the alternate behaviors....\nLikewise, please donât make the behavior of a command-line program\n  depend on the type of output device....\nCompatibility requires certain programs to depend on the type of\n  output device. It would be disastrous if ls or sh did not do so in\n  the way all users expect. In some of these cases, we supplement the\n  program with a preferred alternate version that does not depend on the\n  output device type. For example, we provide a dir program much like\n  ls except that its default output format is always multi-column\n  format.\n\nThe GNU Project considers it undesirable, from a technical perspective, for a utility to produce different output depending on what kind of device it is writing to (at least in the utility's default configuration). For some utilities, including ls, device-dependent output is necessary for compatibility and so it works the way users expect. Some users do also specifically prefer this device-dependent behavior.\nWhile ls could not reasonably be written to behave device independently, a separate dir utility was created to achieve this. Thus dir is not the utility that behaves strangely for reasons of historical compatibility--ls is.\nTo see how ls, dir, and the related vdir utility are implemented in the coreutils source code without needless code duplication, see ls-dir.c, ls-ls.c, ls-vdir.c, ls.h, and ls.c.\nIs dir really useful?\nIf you've ever wished ls produced multi-column output even when you piped it to less (ls | less) or redirected it to a file (ls > out.txt), you can use dir or ls -C.\nIf you've ever wished you could directly copy a filename shown by ls and use it as part of a command without worrying about quoting, you can use dir or ls -b.\ndir is equivalent to ls -Cb, so in that sense you don't need dir. But dir provides a combination of options that in practice is often useful (though not widely known about).\nWhy do I get colorized output from ls (even ls -Cb) but not dir?!\nMost Ubuntu users have an alias called ls which runs ls --color=auto. When ls exists both as an alias and an external command, the alias takes precedence in simple, interactive commands.\nAlias definitions aren't expanded recursively--it's the external ls command that the ls alias is calling with --color=auto. See 6.6 Aliases in the Bash reference manual for more information on how aliases work.\nWhen passed to ls, dir, or vdir (and some other commands, like grep), --color=auto uses color when its output is a terminal, but not otherwise.\nBy default in Ubuntu, user accounts are created with this in ~/.bashrc:\n# enable color support of ls and also add handy aliases\nif [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then\n    test -r ~/.dircolors && eval \"$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)\" || eval \"$(dircolors -b)\"\n    alias ls='ls --color=auto'\n    #alias dir='dir --color=auto'\n    #alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'\n\n    alias grep='grep --color=auto'\n    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'\n    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'\nfi\n\nYou'll notice the ls alias (alias ls='ls --color=auto') is uncommented, while those for dir and vdir are commented out with # so they take no effect. That is, while dir is not an alias, ls is (but not to dir).\nHow do I make dir produce colored output, too?\nTo enable colored output with dir, simply edit .bashrc in your home directory and uncomment the #alias dir='dir --color=auto' line by removing the leading #. In shells started after the change, dir will be an alias.\nIf you want the change in the current shell, you can run the alias definition as a command, or you can source .bashrc by running . ~/.bashrc.\nThis arguably goes against the main point of dir--that it should produce the same sort of output regardless of the output device. However:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you find it useful to make this dir alias, you should certainly do so.\n\n*When called as an external command, for example in scripts or if you override the alias by running \\dir or command dir, dir will still produce device-independent output. This is to say that aliasing dir to dir --color=auto does not really break dir.\n\n\nA: \nI would be inclined to think that dir is there just for backwards\n  compatibility.\nFrom GNU Coreutils:\n\ndir is equivalent to ls -C -b; that is, by default files are listed in columns, sorted vertically, and special characters are represented\n    by backslash escape sequences.\n\nBy the way, ls doesn't colorize the output by default: this is\n  because most distros alias ls to ls --color=auto in\n  /etc/profile.d. For a test, type unalias ls then try ls: it will\n  be colorless.\n\nSource: Renan's answer to What's the difference between âdirâ and âlsâ?\n\nA: Short Answer : None,\ndir is the same source code than ls, ls binary have --color by default. (1 line of code diff)\n\nA: When in doubt, compare type ls vs type dir (see also Difference between ls and la):\n$ type dir\ndir is aliased to `ls -l'\n\n$ type ls\nls is aliased to `_ls'\n\n$ type _ls\n_ls is a function\n_ls ()\n{\n    local IFS=' ';\n    command ls $LS_OPTIONS ${1+\"$@\"}\n}\n$ echo command ls $LS_OPTIONS ${1+\"$@\"}\ncommand ls -N --color=tty -T 0\n\nThe difference boils down to different options to ls, in my case --color=tty would be the most visible, your system may differ.\n", "Q: Can I add external device or other icons to the desktop?

After hours of man page reading and looking for documentation or working examples, I still cannot get xte to emulate a Fn-F7 keypress.\nxte 'keydown Meta_L' 'key F7' 'keyup Meta_L'\n\nI've tried Meta_L, Meta_R, Multi_key, key F7, keydown F7 then keyup F7. No combination seems to work.\nAny idea how I can emulate a combination key press with a Fn key from a command/script?\n\nA: It is usually very tricky or near impossible to use xte to simulate fn + f key keypresses, as the fn key itself does not register at all in xev, and very often the fn keys or fn combinations are not seen by the kernel like other normal keyboard keys.\nSummary\nI actually managed to setup three key combinations (fn + f1, fn + f2 and fn + f3), because pressing each of these combinations resulted in the kernel issuing its 'unknown key pressed...set keycodes' dialogue. This meant that I was able to set the keycodes, and then go to the keyboard shortcuts dialogue and see if a keysym was assigned, e.g. XF86Paste. If so, it was now possible to assign a program to launch from them and it was also now possible to use xte to issue the following command, which was the equivalent of pressing fn + f1 for me:\nxte 'keydown XF86Paste' 'keyup XF86Paste'\n\nIt may be a pecularity of one of my laptops that I can set three of these fn combinations like normal multimedia keys as shown here, but I'll explain the process anyway for you and the particular steps that I followed.\n\nFull Explanation\nYou might not be able to set the keys, as usually you cannot, but two or three may be able to be set, as I found out. Press fn and each of the function keys in turn (f1-f12)  while looking at the kernel log:\ntail -f /var/log/kern.log\n\nIf they are recognised, you will see a kernel scancode:\natkbd serio0: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xa7 on isa0060/serio0).   \nkernel: [22751.972058] atkbd serio0: Use 'setkeycodes e027 <keycode>' to make it known.\n\nNow, for example, you must set these key combinations up with the information given by the kernel- i.e use the kernel scancode and a keycode of your choice (preferably a high number so it doesn't interfere with anything else). See your current keycodes with sudo dumpkeys | grep ^keycode, as noted in this useful Ubuntu wiki article.)\nIt is clear that because fn is not recognised as a key, but only in combination with another key, the key combination fn + f3, for example, is treated in effect as a single key, and so can be set just like other single multimedia buttons:\nsudo setkeycodes e027 135 \n\nThe above command must be entered separately for each of the key combinations you want to set, and must be placed in /etc/rc.local (without the sudo prefix) if you want them loaded on startup.\nNow, you must check if there has been an X keysym associated with your new keycodes by going to keyboard shortcuts and seeing if the key combination, for example fn + F1, can be set. If it can be, a keysym such as XF86Paste will appear and the shortcut can be set to launch any program you wish.\nNow all you need to do to test this with xte is to note the keysym (e.g. XF86Paste) you saw in the keyboard shortcuts dialogue for a particular combination (eg. fn + f1), and enter the appropriate command:\nxte 'keydown XF86Paste' 'keyup XF86Paste'\n\nThis is the equivalent of you pressing and depressing fn + f1.\nIf you have set a program to launch with the key combination (fn + f...) assocated with the keysym, then the xte event will launch that program and you will know that the setting has worked.\n\nConclusion\nThis is a way to set fn + Function key combinations, but it will only be possible for your laptop if the kernel recognises at least one of the combinations as an unknown, but settable key. Only fn +f1, fn +f2, and fn + f3 were settable for me, but it will differ for your computer. If you want to experiment with modifying the actions of your 'sleep' fn + function key button, see this Ubuntu wiki article, but it may not be completely up to date. \n\nA: It looks like the author(s) of xte have fixed/resolved this issue simply.\nAs a test, I bound the F7 key to the Audio Mute functionality, Then, \necho 'key F7' | xte \n\nand confirmed that the F7 key was generated successfully, by xte.\n", "Q: Can I disable the F10 key for all apps without CCSM?

That application looks a bit dangerous so I'm wondering if there's a way to do this without it. There's a keyboard shortcuts dialog but I couldn't find F10 in there. \nThis shortcut is colliding with a shortcut in Chrome that is used for debugging.

The same PDF prints slightly different to 2 different printers. The font and margins are different. \nHow can I standardize the margins and font between the two printers? Is this just a difference in the drivers for each printer?\nBefore you suggest it, the page-top etc options do not have any effect.\n\nA: All printers have their default settings and no two printers print exactly the same.  If you want them to print the document out exactly I would start by looking at each of the printers Margin settings.\n", "Q: Cannot format 500GB USB HD: cannot create partition table When I use disk utility I get the following error:\nError creating partition table: helper exited with exit code 1: Error calling fsync(2) on /dev/sdb: Input/output error\n\ngparted also cannot create a partition table.\nSMART in disk utility runs fine and tells me the hard drive is healthy. I think the HD was used on a windows computer before. Do I need to use a windows computer to fix this?\nhow to use windows to fix: http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/188931en?language=en_US\n\nA: It's possible your partition tables have become corrupted this can happen for many reasons but I have a possible solution that may help anyone who comes across a USB device where disk utilities or gparted throws you errors when trying to format or partition a faulty USB device.\nI've pulled my hair out trying to sort out numerous USB devices that I have corrupted with Ubuntu 12.04.\nOk let's get started.\nPlug in your faulty USB device and start up disk utility you can find it by typing disk utility in the Dash home icon very top left left coroner of the Unity Dash board.\nOnce it's open look on the left hand side and locate your faulty USB device click on it and a page will open, on the right hand side of the screen you should see Device: then what should look like /dev/sdb or maybe /dev/sdb1 depends on what your screen says.\nOpen up the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T now type: sudo fdisk /dev/sdb where you see /dev/sdb after /dev/ this is where you type what you saw on the disk utility screen so if it said /dev/sdb1 on the disk utility screen then the command would be sudo fdisk /dev/sdb1\nSTOP After typing sudo fdisk /dev/sdb if the terminal gives you the following fdisk: unable to open /dev/sdb: No medium found\" Your device is BRICKED, the following commands won't help you in Ubuntu! STOP \nNow enter the following commands:\ntype n and hit Enter\ntype p and hit Enter\ntype 1 and hit Enter\nNow it will ask you where to start the sector/cylinder just hit enter then it will ask you where to end, again just hit enter where going to let it use the default fields.\nNext:\ntype w and hit Enter\nYou should now see:\n\nThe partition table has been altered!\n\nIf you see this were in business!\nNow you should be out of fdisk and back at your home terminal. Now type:\nsudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb or like I said above if in disk utility it said something else then the command would end with /dev/? Whatever disk utility said the device name was.\nOk now exit the \"terminal\" by typing exit then hit enter. Go back to disk utility and eject the device if it doesn't allow you make sure gparted is not running or any other program that might be interacting with the USB device like the \"terminal\".\nOnce the USB device is safely ejected plug the device back in and look at the disk utility program again and open the device once it registers now go to format volume and try to format the volume to FAT with whatever volume name you like. If all goes according to plan the device will format to FAT and you will now be able to control the USB device normally.\nSo now you should be able to reformat and control the USB to whatever format you like. \nFor those that are wondering why at sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb I didn't just make the device fat instead of ext3 for some reason in Ubuntu after I tried fat instead of ext3 I wasn't able to control the device in disk utilities the same way as the method I described maybe a bug I'm not sure but all my USB devices are now free from errors.\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: For Gparted to work the USB drive has to be un-mounted first. Which is unlikely because the hard drive would show in your file system.\nI would use gparted live on CD to fix the issue. Get a copy here http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php\n\nA: Install GParted\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nThen start GParted\nsudo gparted\n\nFind your USB Drive, make sure you are on the correct USB drive and format it.\n\nA: Just to be clear the 1st answer is right if the disk in disk utility is mounted you cannot format it. It will only be possible to unmount it if it is not in use on your system and as this is needed to format it you will be stuck. The solution as already stated is to use a bootable live CD as the first answer stated.\n\nA: Dont use Gparted & Others, format this Hard Drive Disk in another COMPUTER. using a HDD External Case.\n", "Q: Downloads stopping halfway in the Ubuntu Software Center Install Archives() failed: Selecting previously deselected package indicator-multiload.\n(Reading database ... \n(Reading database ... 5%\n(Reading database ... 10%\n(Reading database ... 15%\n(Reading database ... 20%\n(Reading database ... 25%\n(Reading database ... 30%\n(Reading database ... 35%\n(Reading database ... 40%\n(Reading database ... 45%\n(Reading database ... 50%\n(Reading database ... 55%dpkg: unrecoverable fatal error, aborting:\n reading files list for package 'linux-headers-3.0.0-15': Input/output error\nError in function: \n\nI'm new to Ubuntu, and I don't know where to go from here.

It will check your cpuflags, then see if you have a kvm device, and finally it will check if virtualization is disabled in the bios. \nOf course, this means it'll fail if you don't have kvm installed. If you use kvm, you probably won't be able to use VMWare stuff at the same time, and vice versa. However, kvm will only be used when you actually run a VM. \n\nA: It seems one can check directly with the msr-tools\nhttp://linux.koolsolutions.com/2009/09/19/howto-using-cpu-msr-tools-rdmsrwrmsr-in-debian-linux/\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install msr-tools\n$ sudo modprobe msr\n$ sudo rdmsr 0x3A\n\nThe register should return 5 if the extensions are enabled, and return 1 if disabled.\n", "Q: gconf-editor settings not being saved Recent gconf-editor settings\nIn terminal\ngconftool-2 --type int --set /desktop/gnome/thumbnail_cache/maximum_age \"-1\"\n\nCannot make setting stick.

With a 1366 x 768 monitor, I end up with two large black bars on the sides of the screen, and I have to manually set the resolution back to 1366 x 768 via system settings. This does not affect the Ubuntu login screen; it occurs only after I log in. How can I make my computer automatically start up at the correct resolution? \n\nA: You can make a script:\nRun gedit ~/.screenmod and paste  \n\n#!/bin/bash\ngnome-terminal -e \"bash -c \\\"xrandr -s 1366x768; exit; exec bash\\\"\"\nexit 0\n\nSave.  \nMake it executable: chmod +x ~/.screenmod \nAnd then put it at startup applications:\n \n\nExplanation:\nWe first create a file then change it to allow it to run as a script.  \nThe script says:\n1) Open the gnome-terminal and then\n2) Invoke bash to\n3) Run xrandr -s 1366x768 which will change the screen resolution, and\n4) Close after that (exit),\n5) Execute the commands (exec bash see here),\n6) Close the script without error messages (exit 0).\nIn the first answer I think the problem was that we invoke the start up script with a shortcut ~/ instead of the the absolute path /home/[username]. Besides that, to be sure everything works, I decide to also change the script to first open a terminal and then execute what we want instead of just executing xrandr -s 1366x768.  \n", "Q: How can I use Gnome shell's menus in Unity?

It works out of the box, but it seems that it stops working after returning from hibernation mode.\nThis problem has also been addressed in an earlier bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/317270 but judging from this bug report, it should be fixed by now. \nI am running the 2.6.35-23-generic-pae kernel.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You may be hit by this bug instead:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/715267\nA workaround is suggested, to restore touchpad functionality reload the psmouse module, in a terminal do:\nsudo rmmod psmouse; sudo modprobe psmouse\n\nIf this solves the problem then this is likely the bug affecting you.

This is fairly straightforward: use mk-sbuild to build yourself a new chroot. Something like this is what you want:\n\nmk-sbuild --arch=amd64 --name=lucid lucid\n\nThis will guide you to create a chroot called 'lucid-amd64', and prints out the following helpful information when it's done:\n\nDone building lucid-amd64.\n\n To CHANGE the golden image: sudo schroot -c lucid-amd64-source -u root\n To ENTER an image snapshot: schroot -c lucid-amd64\n To BUILD within a snapshot: sbuild -A -d lucid-amd64 PACKAGE*.dsc\n\nSo, once your chroots are setup, the build process would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*From your source pacakge's top-level directory, debuild -S to create a source package, including <package>_<version>.dsc\n\n*Run the build: sbuild -A -d lucid-amd64 ../<package>_<version>.dsc\nFor more info, the manpages for mk-sbuild, schroot, sbuild, debootstrap and debuild are quite comprehensive. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot has some good info about building and configuring the chroots.

As far as I could tell from the responses, this is not quite possible. What you can do, however, is copy your /home/user (where \"user\" is your username) to your Windows partition and install a fresh Ubuntu alongside Windows. Then copy the contents back from the Windows partition and you'll have an Ubuntu install that is almost identical to your wubi install.

It says 'Wired unmanaged' and no option to reset or ad new connection or any 'manage' option.\n\nA: During your tutorial-following, you have probably added a definition for eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces. If an interface is defined in this file, Network Manager assumes that you want to control it manually, and so doesn't manage it for you.\nIf this is indeed the problem, you can fix it by reverting /etc/network/interfaces to its default.

Does anyone know how I can do this?\nps: I'm using Ubuntu 11.04 with Nautilus 2.32.2.1 and Cadaver 0.23.3\n\nA: This answer summarises suggestions given in comments by @Ocaso and @Rinzwind.\nI used this:\nwget -r -nH -np --cut-dirs=1 --no-check-certificate -U Mozilla --user={uname} \n    --password={pwd} https://my-host/my-webdav-dir/my-dir-in-webdav\n\nNot perfect (downloaded lots of 'index.html?C=M;O=D' and the like) but otherwise worked ok. \nThe \"-r\" downloads recursively, following links.\nThe \"-np\" prevents ascending to parent directories (else you download the whole website!). \nThe \"-nH\" prevents creating a directory called \"my-host\" (which I didn't want).\nThe \"--cut-dirs=1\" prevents creating a directory called \"my-webdav-dir\".\nThe \"--no-check-certificate\" is because I'm using a self-signed certificate on the webdav server (I'm also forcing https).\nThe \"-U Mozilla\" sets the user agent in the http request to \"Mozilla\" - my webdav server didn't actually need this, but I've included it anyway.\n\nA: Alternatively you can mount it as a path to be accessed as part of your own file system.\nsudo mount -t davfs https://your.remote/path /your/local/mount/point\n\nNote: /your/local/mount/point has to be a real existing directory for this to work.\nAs far as I know you only need to run the following to get the command to work:\nsudo apt-get install davfs2 (If more configuration is required I apologise, it was a long time ago that I did this.)\n(I added this as an answer because I feel Liam's answer didn't give enough info.)\n\nA: Actually with Cadaver you can cd to directory from which you want to download files and mget *.\n\nA: You can use dav2fs to mount the webdav server, and then you can access it as you would a local directory.\n\nA: I realize that this is an old question, but I was wanting to do this and I found rclone which is like rsync for the cloud and supports a lot of different protocols including WebDAV. You use rclone config to configure a remote and then just do rclone copy remote:path . and int will download everything. You can also use rclone sync remote:path . and it will do checking of the files and only copy updates. It is a golang program so it is very portable.\n", "Q: How to configure proxy settings \"syntax error *extra junk at end of file\" I got the following error after configuring proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf as Acquire::http::proxy http://192.168.96.0:8080:\ne: syntax error /etc/apt/apt.conf:2: extra junk at end of file.\n\nand I don't have the proxy authentication.

Ok, so in powertop (version 1.97), in both the \"overview\" and \"device stats\" sections, I see two devices, each called \"display backlight\".  One shows the correct percentage of use, e.g. if I lower screen brightness then the use goes down, but the other is always at 100%!  The 100% one is always consuming around 2.3 watts, so of course I am interested in killing this thing off, whatever it is.  \nSo my question is: why is powertop doing this?  Is there some technical way in which I do have two displays?  I have a MacBook Air, and I've never even once attached it to an external display.\nUpdate:  Even stranger is that when I start up my system, the \"display backlight\" at 100% is only using 800-900 mW; however, over time, it will work its way up to 2.3 W. \n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro running Leopard and Ubuntu 11.10 in dual boot. System monitor also gives me the same 2 cpu working, and I had one of them always at 100%. I changed the NVIDIA propietary driver to the \"current-updates\" version and it helped, now both cpu run around 30%.

Where can I get that cgidemo script? \nSource: http://humdi.net/vnstat/\n\nA: Rinzwind is right, vnstati generates images. But there is a script also which is written in Perl and uses vnstati. I have found that script after downloading source code of vnstat from here. It is called vnstat.cgi and is located under the folder called examples. You need just configure webserver to run cgi and it outputs the same images as in http://humdi.net/vnstat/cgidemo/ page.\n\nA: You make the images with the command vnstati. From the link:\nDescription\n\nThe purpose of vnstati is to provide image output support for statistics collected using vnstat(1). The image file format is limited to png.

This is what I found. My question is what is the different between  cryptsetup and truecrypt. Is cryptsetup as safe as truecrypt? What is the best way to encrypt an LVM partition? \n\nA: cryptsetup is part of the main Ubuntu archive, which means that it's officially support by Ubuntu developers and Canonical.  It's specific to Linux, and provides block device encryption at the kernel level.\nTruecrypt is not part of the Ubuntu package archive (due to licensing reasons) and is offered as an additional package that you can add to your Ubuntu system.  Truecrypt does its encryption and decryption in userspace, rather than within the Linux kernel, which actually allows it compatibility clients for Windows and MacOS.\n", "Q: What is the best way to check (and repair) hard drive for bad sectors?

Currently, im planing to move my site to Mediatemple. When installing an OS in the server, the latest Ubuntu version they show is 11.04. So, is it safe If I update it to 11.10 with \"do-release-upgrade\"? The server is new and I have nothing to loose yet!\nPS : I just found out why Mediatemple is not supporting Oneiric!

I'll upgrade to 12.04 as soon as they release it!\nAnyway, thanks for your answers!\n\nA: It is more than safe but not really recommended.\nUbuntu 11.10 support will end in April 2013, this means that you will be then forced to upgrade again to some other version.\nI think the best advice here will be wait for 12.04, then wait a couple of days more after the release, upgrade. \nThis way you guarantee that you will be running a version with support for 5 years after the release date. That is the most important fact you need to focus on when talking about servers.\n\nA: Yes, absolutely - 11.10 is 4 months old now and very stable :)\nGo for it. especially if you have nothing to lose on the server. If it doesn't work, what's the worst that happens, you have to install 11.04 again?\nAdditionally, 12.04 will be out in a couple of months and you'd be well advised to upgrade to that when the time comes as it will be a LTS release.\n\nA: Yeah sure if you upgrade to 11.10so that you can easily upgraded 12.04 lts\nupgrading to 12.04 from 11.04 is difficult\n\nA: LTS is the safest option for web server, Ubuntu 10.04 should be your choice for now and go for 12.04 after one year of its release.\n", "Q: indicator-sound doesn't compile Currently i'm trying to get started with indicator development.

I was unable to fix it by installing apt-transport-https, because it had been quite a while since I'd done any package updates on the machine in question, and the version of that package that I needed was no longer available in the package repository. (To get an available version, I first had to be able to apt-get update successfully.) Thus, I was forced to track down the reason why apt-get was suddenly trying to use HTTPS, and stop it from doing that.\nIn my case, it turns out that one of the third-party apt sources that was listed in a config file in my /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory had switched to using HTTPS for all downloads, and they had begun redirecting the http:// URL to an https:// URL. This was making apt attempt to use HTTPS even though none of my source configurations requested it. (I discovered this by opening the source repository URL in my web browser, and noticing that the URL in the address bar changed to https:// when the page loaded.)\nSince this was a third-party repository and thus non-essential, I simply disabled that source temporarily, then reran apt-get update and it worked with no problem. After apt-get update, apt-get upgrade and apt-get install apt-transport-https, I was able to re-enable that third-party apt source, and from there on everything worked.\n\nA: Check the files in this directory: /etc/apt/sources.list.d\nOne of the files addressed a repository starting with HTTPS. Comment that line by adding # in the beginning and try:  apt-get update\n\nA: Try:\nsudo apt-get install apt-transport-https\n\n", "Q: Decrease Backlight Below Minimum I have this laptop that doesn't handle the backlight very well.\nIn /etc/default/grub, I have added a acpi_backlight=vendor function to get it to work at all.

Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: None of the answers here worked for me (on a Dell Precision 5510). The output from cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness for me was 1 and setting it any lower completely turned the screen off.\nI finally found a solution from the answer here:\nxrandr --output eDP1 --brightness .3\n\nI was also able to get this to work on my external monitor (attached via a display port dock), and reduce it below the minimum brightness allowed by the hardware controls on the monitor:\nxrandr --output DP1-1 --brightness .6\n\nNote that your display might not be eDP1 (or DP1-1), but you can list all available displays by hitting tab twice after --output, or from xrandr -q which shows which ones are currently connected. Tweak the value for brightness, i.e., .4, .5, etc until you find a level that works for you.\n\nA: I'm not using Ubuntu but Debian, but sometimes (second screen plugin, gnome restart) the brightness drops to zero. So I've created an inotify enabled application (it consumes zero cputime while there is no change in brightness) and when there is the change and it is changed to zero (or lower some predefined level, which you can specify) it sets the brightness to some default level, which you can also specify.\nPlease find it at my github page: https://github.com/nuccy/zero_brightness_fixer\n\nA: The Gnome Shell extension Alpha Tint has solved the issue for me in Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Wayland).\n\nA: Install xbacklight by typing the following in the terminal\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nthen:\nxbacklight -percentage\n\nreplace the word \"percentage\" with the number of your choice to decrease the backlight from 1 to 99.

I would kindly like to know how I collaborate and share presentations, pictures, etc. in Ubuntu One. Please help me in the simplest way possible as I'm new to Ubuntu One.\n\nA: Their are two options for sharing using Ubuntu One. Their is a 'Share' and a 'Publish' option. Publish is for files and allows you to share that file with anyone via a public URL. 'Share' is for folders and can only be between Ubuntu One users. This is because the Share feature syncs the folder between the two users.\nPublish a File\nYou can share files through a public URL by using the 'Publish' feature. If you are on Ubuntu right-click on a file synced with Ubuntu One and select Ubuntu One > Publish.\n\nUbuntu One will generate a public URL that you can use to share that file. After it is published right-click on the file and select 'Copy Web Link' to copy the URL to your clipboard.\n\nYou can also Publish files using the web interface. Visit https://one.ubuntu.com/files and click 'More' next to the file you want to Publish. This will reveal the publishing options.\n\nClick 'Publish File' and you will then see a Public URL that you can use to share the file. \n\nYou can quit publishing the file by clicking 'Stop Publishing'. Once a file is published its name will appear blue in the web interface for easy identification. if you are on Windows you will need to use the web interface to Publish files.\nShare a Folder\nUbuntu One gives you the option to 'Share' folders with other Ubuntu One users. In Ubuntu if you right-click on a folder that is synced with Ubuntu One and select Ubuntu One > Share a dialog will pop up asking you for the email of the Ubuntu One user you wish to share the file with.\n\nUse the email that they use with Ubuntu One. The person you are sharing with will receive an email telling them you wish to share a folder with them. You can select to give the people you share with Read only or Read/Write privileges. \nYou can also Share folders using the web interface. Click 'More' next to the folder you wish to Share. This will reveal the Share options. Click 'Share Folder' to Share the folder with another Ubuntu One user.\n\nA dialog will pop up allowing you to enter the email of the Ubuntu One user you wish to Share with. You will also have the opportunity to select Read or Read/Write privileges for the people you are sharing with. That user will receive an email notifying them that you wish to Share a folder. Once a folder is shared its name will appear in blue in the web interface for easy identification. If you click More next to a folder that you are sharing you will see the email of the people you are sharing with as well as whether or not they have accepted your share or you are waiting on them to accept.\n\nClick 'Stop Publishing' to quit sharing the folder.\n\nA: You can login into your Ubuntu One account on the web (https://one.ubuntu.com/)\nThen in the Files and folders list (Files tab), click on the right of a folder where the link \"More\" is diplayed. You will see two options: \"Share folder\", and \"Stop syncing this folder\".\nThe option that you need is \"Share folder\". You click on this, and a popup window will appear with the options to share your folder with someone.\nYou can choose if the other person can update or only read your folder.\nSo, you can collaborate with others, sharing your folder.\n", "Q: any application which could sync pics/videos on ubuntu with picasa web album?

I defined a shortcut in System Settings, Keyboard > Shortcuts > own settings (or similar), so that the Sleep buttons runs a script. That works.\nBut since my upgrade to Oneiric, something also locks the screen (in the same way the screen is locked when I press Ctrl+Alt+L). Can I disable that behaviour? What's the name of that lock screen?\nI tried hiding gnome-screensaver and /etc/acpi/ and I looked in gconf-editor /apps/gnome-power-manager/buttons. I didn't find anything related in dconf-editor.\n\nA: You can remap the key using ~/.Xmodmap. Use xev (in a terminal) to find the offending keycode, then assign a different keysym, e.g. XF86WakeUp. Append this line to ~/.Xmodmap (create that file if it does not yet exist):\nkeycode 150 = XF86WakeUp\n\nAfter logging out and logging in again your key should be mapped. If you don't want to log out, you can also use xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap to reload the key mappings.\nUsing xev to actually find the keycode of the key that you want to remap might be not so easy: if the key is already bound to an action (e.g. in the Gnome keyboard properties), xev does not show the keycode. As an example, this is the kind of xev output that you want to see:\nKeyPress event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x5800001,\n    root 0xb3, subw 0x0, time 312883, (737,182), root:(946,647),\n    state 0x0, keycode 180 (keysym 0x1008ff18, XF86HomePage), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nYou can see the keycode (180) in the third line after the word \"keycode\". If you don't get such a block that starts with \"KeyPress event\", your key probably is already bound. You can try to use a non-Gnome desktop like LXDE or KDE and use xev there.\n", "Q: How to install Eclipse on Ubuntu Server I have a new machine with Ubuntu Server. On that server I would like to have Apache with some web services. \nBut how do I install Eclipse on Ubuntu Server? Right now I have no GUI, just command line.\n\nA: First of all: If it's a production server. Don't do it. Installing a GUI will slow performance and may open more security holes. Also never develop directly on a production server.\nSecondarily: If anyone sees this prior to installing Ubuntu Server, you should probably install the desktop version of Ubuntu instead and then install the server-services, since that's quite a lot more well documented and you're probably not going to run Eclipse on a dedicated (production-)server anyway.\nAnd now the answer:\nFirst install the ubuntu-desktop package with # apt-get install ubuntu-desktop (do this as root, or by prepending sudo to the command), then reboot your computer and install eclipse as you would on any other Ubuntu computer.\nSee section one on http://www.ubuntugeek.com/install-gui-in-ubuntu-server.html for more detailed instructions\n\nA: I needed to do this recently to run Eclipse plugin tests on Travis CI (which, as of this writing, runs Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server Edition 64 bit).  \nInstalling Eclipse can be as simple as downloading and extracting the Linux version of Eclipse (For Travis CI, be sure to download the 64 bit edition).  However, Eclipse will crash on starting, giving a \"Cannot open display\" or similar error.  This is because the server edition of Ubuntu is not configured to use a monitor, and (I believe) much of the software needed to show graphics is not included.  The solution by sakjur resolves this by installing that software.\nA less heavy-weight way to do this than installing ubuntu-desktop is to simply add a fake display, in the form of Xvfb.  Once installed, you start it in a background process, set the DISPLAY environment variable and then begin Eclipse.  In the below example, I install a plugin needed to run the JUnit Test Plugins.\nsudo apt-get install xvfb\nXvfb :1 &        #The capitalization of this is important  \nexport DISPLAY=:1\n/dir/to/eclipse -nosplash -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director  -repository http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.4/ -installIU org.eclipse.pde.junit.runtime\n\nFor Travis CI, this gets even better, because Xvfb is already installed!

Right now when I start the computer I have to choose between: Apple from HD, Linux from HD and Linux from Partition 3.\nrEFIt partition tool says there is no need to sync the tables since \"No GTP partition was found\", although it also says it couldn't found gtpsync. According to this tool, there are three partitions on the disk: one for Mac, one for LinuxSwamp and one for Ubuntu.\nUsing the DiskUtility in Mac results differ, showing 4 partitions: 200mb as \"boot volume\", 173gb as the Mac partition, 1023mb named \"disk0S2\" (this is the linux swamp) and 59gb named \"disk0S3\" which is the Ubuntu partition.\nUsing the DiskUtility in Ubuntu shows 3 partitions (it doesn't show the 200mb one). Gparted shows the same 4 partitions that Mac does, and I remember when installing Ubuntu the installation tool showed some other small \"free spaces\" between partitions.\nTo fix the tables, I have tried to install GDISK in Mac and follow the instructions from that Forum post, but after I wrote sudo gdisk /dev/disk0 in Terminal (and after writting my password) I get dyld: unknown required load command 0x80000022 Trace/BPT trap. It might be that Gdisk doesn't work in Leopard?\nI have also tried to fix the tables this way . And I have tried to get ride of that extra Linux icon on rEFIt by following by using sudo fdisk -u /dev/disk0 in MacOS Terminal, but then the only Linux icon I get -which is the Partition3 one- won't boot (so I have to follow the last way to fix tables to get grub reinstalled to /sda).\nSo..... any ideas what to do?? Right now it's not a big deal, since I can work with everything.\n\nA: I can't be positive, but my hunch is that you're seeing two BIOS boot options for Linux, one based off the MBR and one based off the boot partition. If they both work, then deleting the MBR code should eliminate the duplicate; however, there is a risk that if you do this, it'll backfire and Linux won't work at all. If you care to try, do this from Linux:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/external/medium/backup.mbr bs=512 count=1\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=440 count=1\n\nBe very very careful with these commands! If you mistype either of the dd commands, you could end up wiping out critical data. Note in particular that the second command uses a bs=440 option, not bs=512 as in the first command. Also be sure to include the count=1 option for both commands, but especially for the second. Change /path/to/external/medium to a directory where you've got a removable disk mounted. That will provide you with a recovery option, should something go badly wrong; you'll be able to boot with an emergency system and re-issue the first command, but reverse the if= and of= options, to restore the disk to its original state.\nAnother option is to switch from rEFIt to its more recent fork, rEFInd, and to convert from a BIOS-booting option to boot in EFI mode, as described here. You'll then be able to disable scanning for BIOS boot loaders and limit the boot list to however many EFI boot loaders you care to install. This will give you more flexibility, but it will take some effort to set it up, and there's also a risk that it won't work right -- some Macs still have hardware that Linux can't properly initialize when booted in EFI mode, although that problem is much less significant than it was in the past.\n", "Q: Access Exchange 2003 mailbox from Terminal How do I check an Exchange mailbox for new mail from the command line?\nI'm at a complete loss here.\n\nA: You need fetchmail or davmail to sync with access the exchange server from terminal otherwise thunderbird has the ability to do that.\nSee here for instruction ablut thunderbird:\nhttp://downloadsquad.switched.com/2007/03/30/howto-thunderbird-and-ms-exchange-server/\n", "Q: How can I remove Wine 1.4rc3 and install Wine 1.3.37 from Ubuntu PPA?

But what I want to do is set up an adhoc wireless network so another device can connect to my network and in turn I want that device to be able connect to the internet through the network. I've managed to set it up relatively effortlessly on Win7 so the it is possible on my hardware. But now I need to do it here.\nBasically what i've done is the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to a \"Automatic (PPP)\" Mobile Broadband\n\n*Set up a wireless network\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the SSID to a unique name\n\n*Set the Mode to \"Ad-hoc\"\n\n*Set the IPv4 Method to \"Manual\"\n\n*Set the IP Address (196.168.137.100), Netmask, Gateway (196.168.137.1) to the same as what I would on win7\n\n*Tried leaving the DNS server blank, tried filling it with the same DNS server the mobile card uses and tried setting it to 8.8.8.8\n\n\n\ntested... didn't work... read some tutorials\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Firestarter\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the Internet Connected Network device to ppp0\n\n*Local network connected device to wlan0\n\n*Enable internet connection sharing\n\n\n\nat this point i cant even connect to the internet on this computer unless i disable the wlan\nwhat am i doing wrong?\n\nA: Since you're able to use ppp0 and wlan0 both, i'll skip to the main thing. You don't need firestarter. You see to use automatic configuration, you would have to install a DHCP server, which is a fairly painful process, when you take into account all the configuring you need to do. So we'll do this the static way. On your linux machine that is connected to the internet, execute the following commands as root:\niptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o wlan0 -s 192.168.137.1/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nAfter you do this, go to your other machines and enter the following the the TCP/IPv4 settings for the ad-hoc wireless connection:\nIP address: 192.168.137.1-254 (except 100)\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.0\nGateway: 192.168.137.100\n\nPrimary DNS: 8.8.8.8\nSecondary DNS: 8.8.4.4\n\nAnd if everything goes well, you should be able to ping google.com\n", "Q: How to view network shares in a consitant way?

Here it goes:\nI have Windows 7 installed in one of my hard drives. The whole drive is for Windows. As I installed Windows 7 on it, it partitioned the drive into 2 parts. One is called the \"System Reserved\" and the other is where Program Files and the rest of the directories are.\nI wish to run this Windows 7 already installed, in some kind of Virtual environment (Like virtualbox, xen or similar) from Ubuntu. Is there a virtual environment that I can tell it to run this windows 7 from within Ubuntu.\nI may be going out of the box out here but is this possible with any tool that Ubuntu comes with.\n\nA: I'd suggest installing virt-manager and virtualisation infrastructure, libvirt-bin. You should be able to use virt-manager to create a virtual machine for your Windows 7 install.\nThis will run the OS in a KVM virtual machine. Unfortunately, you may find that the system is a little slower than when run natively. If performance is a concern for you (are you looking to run games?), then you may want to look into a VMWare or virtualbox solution instead. If performance isn't a big issue, then I'd recommend using KVM, as it works well within Ubuntu, and is completely open source.\nTo do this: use the virt-manager program to create your new Windows VM.\nIn the configuration screens, you should simply be able to connect the existing disk (eg, /dev/sdb) to the new virtual machine, and use that disk as the boot device.\nNo need to convert your disk to any other type of virtual storage, it should be usable as-is.

With the plethora of possibilities for most command-line tools, I would be surprised to learn that there is no way to colorize the info that apt-get, apt-cache, and related tools return. Even so, Googling was fruitless in this.\nPrimarily, it would be nice to have the summary lines that show total count/size, and color-code each type of action count: eg, upgrades in blue, installs in green, held in yellow, and removed in red.\n\nA: Sure, it's easy. There are even tools for it.

While the excellent Arch Linux's pacman has built-in colorizing capabilities (and a few more available via 3rd-party wrappers) there's nothing similar for the aging apt/dpkg combo nor the relatively newer aptitude tool.\nThis is how pacman looks like using an external wrapper (mostly Yaourt or Packer, can't remember which one I was using at the time):\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ABk0u.png\n\nA: This is the closest you can get:\nHow do I enable fancy apt colours and progress bars?\nFor the rest you can use sed/awk and terminal color codes.\n", "Q: Disable Multitouch Driver and return to default touchpad I have Ubuntu 11.10 installed in dual boot in a MacBook Pro 5.1.\nI have installed the xserver-xorg-input-multitouch Multitouch X input driver, but I'm not sure I like it (it's too sensitive and moves too fast). So I want to get back to the default touchpad settings, but I can't.\nIf I remove the Multitouch X driver via synaptics, the touchpad won't work anymore. I have tried installing gsynaptics+gpointing device settings, and also I tried installing Synaptics TouchPad driver for X.Org server but nothing works other than the Multitouch X (which is the one installed now, all the others are not).\nAlso, I don't have the \"touchpad\" tab under the \"Mouse and Touchpad\" settings anymore, it disappeared.\nSo, how can I bring back the default touchpad and the touchpad tab?\nThanks!\n\nA: Type gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf at the terminal.  Check for the section having to do with the touchpad.  It should start with Section \"InputClass\" and end with EndSection with multitouch somewhere in the middle.  Put # in front of every line of that section.  Now quit gedit and reboot.   You should be back to your old trackpad driver and see it appear in the Mouse and Touchpad settings of System Settings.\nBasically what I think is happening is that this conf file is being read even after you deleted the Multitouch X driver.  So it tries to initialize a nonexistent driver and thus your trackpad doesn't work.\n\nA: I figure it out, and I have back the default touchpad and the touchpad tab in Mouse Settings:\n1) Using Synaptic Package Manager (install it from the Software Center if you don't have it) uninstall xserver-xorg-input-multitouch Multitouch X input driver. Then install gsynaptics+gpointing device settings and xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n2) Do what C S was recommending: type in terminal gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and add # at the beginning of each line. This will make all the lines be comments, as if they weren't there.\n3) I had to do the same in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-multitouch.conf, which is the file start with:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"true\"\n    Identifier \"Multitouch Touchpad\"\n    Driver \"multitouch\"\nEndSection\n4) Restart your comtputer\nYour touchpad should work again as when you first installed Ubuntu, and you should have the touchpad tab back in your Mouse and Touchpad settings. At least this worked for me.\nStill, be aware that Multitouch driver allows you to drag and drop with two fingers, and to select text. I just don't like how sensitive it is, so if someone knows how to edit that I might give it a try again.\n\nA: I'm editing because my comment made no sense. So, apparently at the end I was running the mtrack driver. When I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04, the touchpad wasn't working at all. I kind of reinstalled the drivers and it seems to work find now, except that I have no right-click. So I'm trying changing from multitouch to mtrack and editing the conf file and we'll see.\n", "Q: Navigating windows folder on Ubuntu partition I have a dual boot Win7/Ubuntu LTS.

I am reading Debian vs. Ubuntu vs. Linux Mint: Which Distribution Should You Use?\n\nUbuntu, on the other hand, is made to include a good combination of\n  new and stable ... Some packages can be used on both distributions,\n  while others are specifically for one or the other\n\nIf Ubuntu is based on Debian, how is it more updated? Does it simply use different apt soures? \nAgain since it's based on Debian, why are there differences in package compatibility? Does it simply have some different things installed? \nCan I say:\n\n\n*\n\n*All Debian packages will work on Ubuntu.\n\n*All Ubuntu packages will work on Linux Mint (based on Ubuntu).\n\n\nA: A \"Debian release\" itself isn't one thing, there usually different releases of Debian in the wild. \nDebian has a branch called \"unstable\", or \"sid\", named after the kid from Toy Story who breaks his toys.\nDebian also has a \"stable\" release, which is released when it's ready. These are usually released in longer intervals. \nIn between is a release called \"testing\", with versions of software newer than stable but older than unstable. Eventually \"testing\" is promoted to a stable release.\nTypically during their development cycle, Ubuntu imports source packages from Debian Unstable (sid). At some point we stop automatic imports and instead pull in fixes manually and then release it as Ubuntu every 6 months. During LTS releases where stability is more important, Ubuntu will pull from the testing release instead.\nAfter Ubuntu releases, there's a big sync up back with Debian and the process repeats. \nBoth Debian Stable and Ubuntu take Debian Unstable -> Testing -> and then make stable releases based off of that. The major difference between the processes is that Ubuntu is time-based, importing and making freezes based on the schedule and goals for that release, whereas Debian cycles at a slower rate and doesn't have a strict \"We need to release regularly\" goal. Ubuntu will also sometimes take things that are important to its users and package those directly, sometimes submitting those back to Debian if appropriate.  I talk a bit about that here:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between upstream and downstream when referring to who to go to as a developer?\nA long time ago Debian stable releases could take a really long time, sometimes up to 3 years: so long that by the time it was released some of the software was badly out of date.  The past few releases have been much quicker, running about 1.5-2 years between - about the same interval as Ubuntu LTS releases, but since the schedule isn't the same, the Debian release may have newer software than the most recent Ubuntu LTS release (or vice versa).\nDebian and Ubuntu packages are often binary compatible: programs built on one distribution can be copied to the other and will run successfully.  But this relies on having the same libraries available that the package was built against, which is not always the case, either between an Ubuntu release and a Debian release or between two successive releases of the same distribution.  Also, there's a lot more to distribution integration than just having the right libraries, so even if the program in the package has everything it needs to be run, the package could fail to install or run correctly because of any number of differences between the distributions: an Ubuntu package may not be usable on Debian because it requires upstart, for example.\nIn general, if you think the packaging should be the same between Debian and Ubuntu, it's still easiest to rebuild the binary packages for the exact toolchain of your release.  You can easily import the source package and build it yourself or on in a PPA. \nEvery once in a while, the Debian and Ubuntu releases line up where we can share things like a GCC, libc6, or python version or whatever. That is of course great for the ecosystem because having things that closely aligned makes things easier for users, packagers, and upstreams. This is why the toolchain discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit usually take into account the state of Debian at the time.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu does use different apt sources. They have many people who check the packages for new versions. Ubuntu also modified apt quite a bit, so that might explain why they aren't compatible (I'm not exactly sure myself, but that might be part of it).\n", "Q: Showing music from Windows partition in music folder I have my music stored on my Windows partition, and I can access them from Ubuntu. Is there anyway to represent them virtually in my music folder in home. What I want to do is similar to how the Windows 7 library folders work. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Mounting the partition as Denis suggests is ideal if the Music folder is on it's own partition. Even if it is not you can mount any folder under another location using the -o loop option to mount.\nThe simpler way maybe to just create a link from the folder containing the Music to your home folder.\nRight click on the folder containing the Music and choose \"Make Link\", then copy the link to your home directory and rename it to something like \"Windows Music\".\n", "Q: Is it possible to lock the volume slider? I was wondering if there was anyway that I could lock the volume control for a user  because I have a computer hooked up to a sound system but if the computer does any amplification at all i.e. above 50% volume then it sounds distorted on the speakers. So I would like to lock in the computer volume at 50% for one if not all users at 50% and just use the control board its plugged into to control the volume.\nAnd help would be awesome thanks.\n\nA: I don't know if it is possible to lock the Volume Slider, but the same effect of locking it at 50% can certainly be achieved.\nHave a look at this Answer to a similar question which has been marked as 'Accepted' by its OP. According to this, to achieve the effect of capping the slider limit to 50%, we would use the value as 32768.\nSo, we would set the sink level using the following command in a terminal:\npacmd set-sink-volume <sink> <value>\nAnd replace <value> with 32768; and <sink> with the sink name or sink index obtained from the following command:\npacmd list-sinks\nThis would achieve the effect of capping the volume slider at 50% (virtually).\n", "Q: Conect my tablet to a TV with HDMI I have a tablet with ubuntu 11.10 and I want to connect it to my TV.

I'm testing Ubuntu development version and I want to know when to update the packages. The last time I update the packages regularly, the system broke and I had to reinstall the OS. \n\nA: First of all, I would say that if it's more than a small inconvenience to you if the system breaks utterly, then you probably shouldn't use it in the first place. Though it's highly valuable when people do and file bugs when things go awry. Though the goal is for it to be usable throughout the development cycle, with the massive amounts of changes, there's always a chance that something breaks. \nMilestone releases (Alphas, Betas and Release Candidates) are usually fairly safe points to upgrade. But every release is different, and the situation changes during development. The Precise cycle (intended to become 12.04LTS) is a fairly conservative cycle and things have been rather stable, though there have been issues and breakages. The cycles leading up to 11.04 and 11.10 was much more turbulent. \nFor these reasons, it's difficult and somewhat dangerous to give general advise about when to upgrade, except for the milestones. Whenever you upgrade a development version, you should first read and understand the changes. You might want to join #Ubuntu+1 on the Freenode IRC network. This is where testers hangout during the development and you can ask others what their experiences are.  \nThis will become less of an issue in future versions since âÂ thanks to BtrFS â you'll be able to just undo the upgrade or even boot into a previous version of the OS. So, if an upgrade totals your system, you'll just boot into the state before you upgraded, and no harm will have been done. You can actually do that now. Ubuntu has BtrFS support, at least in the Alternate installer. Using it properly, however, requires a little bit of reading. (Ubuntu is a little bit special in that area) But if you intend to do a lot of testing, and follow the development cycles, I'd say it's probably worth it. \n\nA: I think that the first answer is missing the point. The question is not when should I upgrade to a development release but \"What is the best time to update the current development version of Ubuntu? And the answer to that question is - Daily.\nSome of those who test the development release update it two or three times a day. Some issues are caused by some libraries being upgraded and other related libraries not being upgraded. And so an application or daemon closes unexpectedly. This cannot be reported as a bug because it is due to obsolete packages.\nThere are two ways to solve this.\n1) Run Synaptic Package Manager, locate the obsolete package and mark it for upgrade and then click apply. You will be shown what packages are going to be upgraded, installed and removed. Make sure that Ubuntu-desktop is not going to be removed. I have found that Synaptic sometimes tries to do that. Find Ubuntu-Desktop and remove the check mark.\n2) Wait a few hours and run Update manager and you may see that the obsolete packages are about to be upgraded. Sometimes you might have to wait a couple of days.\nA recent update removed Ubuntu Software Centre and it could not be re-installed because a \ncertain package was not ready. Two days later an update brought in that package and I was able to re-install Software Centre.\nA lot of issues with the development release are solved by doing daily updates. I have found that changes to the development release are done in small steps and so an update dated development release is always the best state to be in.\nAlways, when using a development release, be ready to do a re-install of Ubuntu. Sometimes, it is the quick and painless method of getting back into the action. although finding out how to fix breakages can also be interesting.\nEarly this morning I ran an update and when I booted just now I found that the application lens was blank. This problem was solved by re-installing the application lens.\nPart of running a development release is having problems and fixing them. Daily updates are the best way of keeping the OS fixed.\n", "Q: ssh client takes a long time to respond I have 2 servers, A & B, both running CentOS 5.7.\nIf I ssh using Putty from Windows 7 to server A or B, the password prompt is quick\nBut if I ssh from Ubuntu 11.10 to server A, the password prompt takes a long time, almost 2 minutes; while server B password prompt is quick, though not as quick as using Putty.\nhtw@htw-HP-ProBook-4421s:~$ time ssh use@A.biz\nuser@A.biz's password: \nConnection closed by A.biz\n\nreal    2m33.170s\n\nhtw@htw-HP-ProBook-4421s:~$ time ssh user@B.biz\nuser@B.biz's password: \n\nreal    0m1.904s\n\nThere shouldn't be anything wrong with both servers since ssh-ing from Win 7 is quick.

How can I change the icon Docky uses?\n\nA: Probably there are scalable vector graphics (*.svg files) for all your applications except of jdownloader (which has only a small png file or so).\nThere are several folders in /usr/share with icons and images. One is /usr/share/icons, another /usr/share/pixmaps/. Probably in one of the two you'll find a icon jdownloader.png. If you don't find it, search for the *.desktop file (the launcher) and open it with your favourite text editor. You'll find a line \"Icon=XY\" and XY  is the name of the icon (without the file ending). You can then search /usr/share for this name. The desktop file is located in /usr/share/applications but you get it even faster by right-click in your application menu and then \"Add this launcher to desktop\".\nIf you found the icon file used, you can replace it with another one with higher resolution. Or even better if you have a SVG version of it, just place the svg file there (no need to remove the other file then). But unfortunately it doesn't seem as if there is a SVG file for the official logo available.

In my ubuntu-based system, everytime update-initramfs gets called I got errors like this:\n.: 6: Can't open /scripts/casper-functions\n\nSo I took a look around and found the script casper-functions in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts.\nUsing grep I found the scripts referencing /scripts/casper-functions.\nNow I have two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Comment out the lines referenciing the script (which shouldn't make any difference, I think, because it's not working anyway.)\n\n*Fix all refences to this script. (And fix a reference in the script itself)\nI tried both and ran\ndpkg-reconfigure console-setup\n\nThere haven't been any errors reported in any case. But before I do either of this (and reboot) I would like to know what this script does. I'm not really familiar with sh-scripts, so I couldn't figure it out, yet.\nUPDATE:\nI replaced all references of /scripts/casper-functions with /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-functions and replaced /scripts/functions with /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/functions in casper-functions.\nAs result a created live-cd (remastersys - backup) won't boot anymore (it did boot before).

So I've just had to do a reinstall and as part of that process, I'm starting a new account to remove some of the crufty config I've built up over time.\nI've been fairly successful cherry-picking certain applications' configuration by copying over their old directories but gedit is being a pain.\nI've already copied over the following:\n.gconf/apps/gedit-2\n.local/share/gedit\n.config/gedit\n\nAnd that has allowed me to use my old plugins but nothing else. It's not remembering colours, which plugins were enabled or individual plugin config.\nI'm coming from the same version of Ubuntu so would have expected this to cater for all my settings. I'm afraid there might be config stuck in dconf.\n\nA: gedit keeps some of it's preferences in gnome registry.\nYou can see them if you spawn gconf-editor and visit /apps/gedit-2 \nTo export use sth like\ngconftool --dump /apps/gedit-2  > gedit.settings\nthen copy the gedit.settins file and import with\ngconftool --load gedit.settings\n(or play with ~/.gconf directory but it may be less safe)\nUpdate: some of the attributes may be not set just for gedit, but more generally. A few searches in gconf-editor may help locating them.\n\nA: I would first jump to the conclusion that you are correct about these settings being saved by dconf. The first thing I did was run\nlocate gedit\n\nI looked through and did not find much else besides what you already mentioned. I then took up to finding where the dconf settings are saved and determined you would check the settings using either \ndconf list /org/gnome/gedit/\n\nor read the actual settings replacing 'list' with 'read' once you locate the setting you wish to read using the list command.\nI think the simplest option is to copy ~/.config/dconf/ and all subdirectories unless you can determine which user dir is yours.\nThe other alternative is to use dconf dump and dconf write You can find a lot of information you need here: At the bottom of this page\n\nA: You were right about config being stuck inside dconf, that's where gedit's settings live. I wouldn't advise porting them across versions though, there's no guarantee they'll be compatible and you may get all sorts of nasty results. Try getting both source and target gedit installations to the same version before you attempt migrating the settings.\nSo, to do what you asked, you might first store the config dump in a file named gedit-dump.conf:\ndconf dump /org/gnome/gedit/ > gedit-dump.dconf\n\nThen, on the target machine, you'd load that file:\ndconf load /org/gnome/gedit/ < gedit-dump.dconf\n\nYou knew the settings might be in the dconf database, so you could actually have checked where they were on your own:\ndconf dump / | grep gedit\n\nIf you need, you can clean up gedit's settings with:\ndconf reset -f /org/gnome/gedit/\n\n", "Q: Docky can't open apps which are added by \"pin to dock\" I just installed Docky on Xubuntu and for adding Home folder and Terminal to it, i opened these apps and clicked on their icons for \"Pin to dock\".

You can try to drop some applications' shortcut from /usr/share/applications to your dock. (If some applications are not in this folder you just need to create a new .desktop file).\n\nA: *\n\n*Create shortcuts of your apps\n\n*Put them into folder /usr/share/applications \n\n*Finally put them into docky. \n\n\nTested on Debian 7 Xfce.\n\nA: I managed to correct this issue (on 12.04) with Terminal and Thunar by editing the Menu:\nRight-click Menu, select Properties, then Edit Menu, select Accessories category on the left, and then, on the right, untick File manager and tick Thunar File Manager instead. For terminal, untick Terminal Emulator and tick Terminal. \nThen, open Start Menu and drag the application icon directly onto Docky. From now on the launchers in Docky should work and the icons should display correctly\n\n\nA: Docky basically displays the programs/folders/whatever you have on your desktop.\nIf you put something into Docky and deleted it on the desktop, it will not work.\nIf you did this, simply put the programs out of the trashbin on your desktop.\n", "Q: how to disable the trackstick in dell? How to disable the trackstick which is in between the keys of the Dell laptop keyboard.

Mine is the 7th line down:\nâ   â³ AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick             id=15   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nTake note of its id number (15 in my case), then use that in the next command:\n\n\n*To disable it:\nxinput --disable 15\n\nYou might also try the following, as recommended by @Brent Zundel in his comment under this answer:\nxinput --set-prop \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick\" \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nIf you'd ever like to re-enable it, try the following:\nxinput --enable 15\n\nOR\nxinput --set-prop \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick\" \"Device Enabled\" 1\n\nSee man xinput for more details.\n\n\n*Now the problem is that our change above is not persistent across reboots. To fix that do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Startup Applications\" program in Ubuntu.\n\n*Click \"Add\" to add an additional startup program.\n\n*Put your disable command from above (ex: xinput --disable 15) into the \"Command\" box, and anything you want into the \"Name\" and \"Comment\" boxes. Mine looks like this:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*See also the comment under this answer from @Brent Zundel. He recommends you use the following command instead, to ensure that it always works even if the device ID number changes: xinput -set-prop \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick\" \"Device Enabled\" 0.\n\n\n\n*Click \"Add\" and then \"Close\".\n\nDone! Now it will run this script every time you reboot, thereby automatically disabling it again.\nNote: if you think you can place this command in /etc/rc.local instead, to run at startup, it probably won't work since xinput requires the X Window System to be running. See here: Why won't rc.local run xinput?. In either case, I couldn't get it to work that way, even with adding sleep 10 before the command. But, adding it to the \"Startup Applications\" as I explain above does work.\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*See my touchpad_toggle.sh script in my dotfiles project: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles.\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*Thanks to @YetAnotherG33k's answer for first getting me on the right track by informing me about xinput.\n\n*And thanks to @Brent Zundel for his comment below my answer too.\n\n\nA: In addition to fine answer of Gabriel Staples I'd like to mention that in some Dell laptop models xinput's output may not contain any sign of pointing stick. In my case (Latitude 5591 laptop) it was \"DELL0819:00 044E:121F Mouse\" with \"id=13\" and disabling it with xinput --disable 13 helped.\nWhat can you do to find out the name of the pointing stick device in that case? Try grep \"input device\" /var/log/Xorg.0.log output, the desired device should have type: MOUSE. Corresponding id should be the one you are looking for.\nMore universal way of disabling pointing stick which should work both in X and in Wayland is to use udev rules. If you are using Wayland then xinput tool will be unavailable.\nFirst run cat /proc/bus/input/devices and scan its output for the devices with Handlers containing the word mouse. One of them will be the pointing stick. Notice its Name field, we will use it later (in my case it was \"DELL0819:00 044E:121F Mouse\", as I mentioned earlier). Then copy the long value of Sysfs field of this device and use it in the next command. In my case it was:\nudevadm test /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:15.1/i2c_designware.1/i2c-2/i2c-DELL0819:00/0018:044E:121F.0001/input/input24\n\nThe output of this command should contain several parameters starting with ID_INPUT. Combining the name of our pointing stick and these parameters we can create the rule:\nATTRS{name}==\"DELL0819:00 044E:121F Mouse\", ENV{ID_INPUT}=\"\", ENV{ID_INPUT_MOUSE}=\"\", ENV{ID_INPUT_POINTINGSTICK}=\"\"\n\nNow create the file 99-pointstick-off.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/ folder and add the rule there. Reboot. Pointing stick should be disabled now.\nThe insight regarding this method I gained here.\n\nA: Adapting form YetAnotherG33k's answer:\nOn Debian GNU/Linux 11 running KDE Plasma Version 5.20.5 this did the trick for me:\n\n*\n\n*Find the device name of the notebook's dualpoint stick:\n\nxinput list | grep \"DualPoint Stick\"\n\nOutput:\nâ   â³ AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick             id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\n\n\n*Copy the device name. In my case it's called \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick\" and insert it in:\n\nxinput -set-prop \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick\" \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nThis solution is better than disabling the device using a device ID as the device ID could change overtime, thus resulting in disabling the wrong device.\n", "Q: How do I replace a cable modem router with my own server as DHCP? My ISP gave me a really crappy router-modem-combination that lacks basic features. For instance you can't assign a constant ip to the mac adress of a client PC. I run a server for my home entertainment system and a storage server. Both should have a static ip within my LAN.\nSo my thought was to disable the DHCP-Server on the crappy modem and let my home entertainment server do the ip assignments. I was thinking dnsmasq, but I don't seem to get it to work. I thought maybe someone can help me\nSo the situation:\n192.168.0.1 is the server ip in LAN, lets say its mac is aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa and it is connected to a switch with device eth0. Here it's /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.0.1\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.0.2\n\n192.168.0.2 is the ip of the cable modem (set statically). It is connected to the internet and the same switch as the server. mac: bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb\n192,168.0.3 is supposed to be the future ip of the network storage system, lets say its mac adress is cc:cc:cc:cc:cc:cc. It is also connected to the same switch as the other devices\nWhat I've done so far:\nI've installed dnsmasq on the server, stopped the service and edited /etc/dnsmasq.conf to look like this:\ninterface=eth0\ndhcp-range=192.168.0.10,192.168.0.254,72\ndhcp-host=aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa,server,192.168.0.1,infinite\ndhcp-host=bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb,cable,192.168.0.1,infinite\ndhcp-host=cc:cc:cc:cc:cc:cc,storage,192.168.0.3,infinite\n\nI've edited /etc/resolv.conf to contain the localhost (server) and the nameservers of the ISP:\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nnameserver 123.321.123.321\nnameserver 321.123.321.123\n\nThe Problem:\nThe DHCP works just fine, but for some reason dnsmasq gives the wrong gateway. It gives the server's ip instead of the gateways.\n\nA: Okay, I just found out about the dhcp-option in /etc/dnsmasq.conf:\ninterface=eth0\ndhcp-option=3,192.168.0.2\ndhcp-range=192.168.0.10,192.168.0.254,72\n\nThat solves the problem.

At the moment I push everything through a vpn, but that gives overhead on an already slow network. \nI was wondering how I could make all my traffic go through my eth0 but make my ssh connection use wlan0 instead of eth0.\nIt's important all other traffic goes through eth0 as the wifi here is extremely slow, but just fast enough for a simple shell.\n\nA: Set up eth0 as the default route, set up an alternate route through wlan0, and configure the ssh traffic to go through the alternate route.\nInstall the iproute package to manipulate routing tables through the ip command. Mark the outgoing packets that you want to re-route, and set up a routing rule to route those packets through a different interface. Untested:\niptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -o eth0 -j MARK --set-mark 1\nip rule add fwmark 1 table 1\nip route add 0.0.0.0/0 table 1 dev wlan0\n\n\nA: It's somewhat complex. You will need to create an alternative route table, use iptables to mark the package and add a routing rule to force the kernel to use the alternate routing table when the package is marked.\nYou have a good tutorial for a somewhat more complex setup here.\n\nA: Are you wanting this to be used on just your computer or are you wanting to route all traffic on your network this way?  If just yours do you have both eth0 and wlan0 interfaces running and configured to access your network?

Thus apt-get decides that it's best to remove it than to leave it in a broken state.\nFor instance, Lazarus wants libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0, which is not available in your version of Ubuntu (Lucid). Also, the version of libgtk2.0-0 it needs (2.24.0 or greater) is only available from Ubuntu 11.04 onwards.\nWhat this indicates is that the Lazarus package was created in a newer version of Ubuntu. \nNow, you say it works, so it's apparently not entirely incompatible with the libraries you have installed. So it's a problem with the software's packaging, rather than with the binaries themselves. If it works with older versions of, say, libgtk, the package should not require a newer version. This would have to be fixed by the Lazarus people.\nThere are two ways to fix the packaging problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to find a version of the Lazarus package for Ubuntu 10.04 (may be outdated and lack features you need).\n\n*Upgrade your Ubuntu to a newer release, it's very likely that Lazarus will install without conflicts there.\n\nA: You need at least Ubuntu 11.04 to use these Lazarus packages.

After seeing how flexible Linux is with the boot options when I was setting up the BTRfs setup, I'm suspecting there is a way to do this.\nEdit about virtualization: I don't want to do Virutalization because of the performance hit involved-I only have 1.5 G of ram, and Ubuntu does a pretty good job of using that without virtualizing anything. The other problem is that if delete something on a VM, then it does not free the space in the image. Plus, you don't get things like graphical acceleration easily with VMs.\nAlso, I recently set up LUKS (Linux's disk encryption) on another system and it seems like there it is actually possible to do a fair amount from the  initial image before you mount the root filesystem. (I saw a howto that set up a ssh server in that image, so you could remote in and type the key so the system could be booted remotely). The other reason I think this must be possible is that somehow the LiveCD's mount the CD's filesystem, make a RAM filesystem,  and then make a AUFS filesystem from the two, and then mount the AUFS filesystem as the root. I'm thinking that if you can read filesystems without having the root filesystem in place, then can't you just read the one ext4 filesystem and then make a bind mount from /Ubuntu10.10 to / and use that?\n\nA: If you are wanting to use a guest OS and not have to set multiple partitions i would use Virtual Box or VMware.  This will create pretty much a virtual partition on your current one and encapsulate the OS and its contents inside a folder of its own.  As far as creating folders in an existing file system to store multiple os's goes, I don't believe this can be obtained.  Reason being is because you would have to boot to existing file system in order for folders/directories to be accessible in the first place.\n", "Q: How do you resize the standard Ubuntu Desktop inside of Virtualbox? So I've installed Ubuntu inside of Virtualbox, and I resized the window of Virtualbox to be full-size, but the Ubuntu Desktop stays the same standard size. How do I make the width of Ubuntu stretch 100% across the Virtualbox window?\n\nA: Shutdown your virtual box and in a terminal shell type the following command\nVBoxManage setextradata global GUI/MaxGuestResolution 1366,768\nthe 1366,768 is just what i have set for my screen resolution on my laptop, change this to whatever your current resolution is on the machine your running.  This should maximize all screens to full 100% on all guest os's\n\nA: Using Ubuntu inside VirtualBox on Win7 you need to reboot Ubuntu after the virtualbox-guest-dkms install before resizing would work.\n\nA: Once you have installed the VirtualBox Extension Pack (scroll until you see the Extension Pack section) use host+G or the menu option under View > Auto-resize Guest Display.\n\nNOTE: The Extension Pack version must match the version of VirtualBox.\n\n\nA: Inside the virtual machine, install the virtualbox-guest-dkms, virtualbox-guest-utils and virtualbox-guest-x11 packages. These \"guest additions\" include a video driver that will do what you ask, plus a mouse driver that interacts with the host system so you don't have to use the host key to \"uncapture\" the mouse; it just works when you're on the virtual machine's window.\nThere are 2 ways to do this:\n\n*\n\n*From the VirtualBox top menu choose Devices, Install guest additions, then wait for a mock-CD ROM to appear and run the install from there, or\n\n\n*just type\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11\n(personal recommendation: the second (apt-get) option is very simple and quick).\n", "Q: Getting Started with Developing Desktop Themes From a development standpoint, where would one start in developing their own themes for the Ubuntu Desktop.\nObviously, the artist would need image editing software like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gimp, or\n\n*Photoshop, via Virtualbox or Wine\nWhat other software would someone need that is Ubuntu Based?\nAre there other concerns that one should look out for?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Themes are based on CSS, which is the same language that's used to style web pages. So grab a CSS tutorial. You can do lots of stuff just using your favorite text editor. And as you mention, you'll probably want some tools to do some graphics. \nYou can read more about theming Gnome on their developer portal: http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/theming.html\n", "Q: Alternative to Nautilus archiver handler When I compress files, I expect two basic options. None of which are present in Nautilus's \"compress...\" context menu action, and instead there is only option to set password. So thought to ask for some solution if someone has already solved this nicely.\nMost important to me:  \n1 - compression level \nBecause often I just want to store files fast. And I don't want to compress hard (default option) files that are already compressed (audio, video, pdf, exe etc), saving both time/speed and efficiency, and yet future efficiency when unpacking ;)\nAnother thing with which I can live without, but prefer it present:  \n2 - compression algorithm \nSimply I choose different algorithm for text and binary files\nI usually use 7z or rar, but also gzip\n\nUpdate:\nI couldn't imagine this would be such problem. I found only xarchiver in repository, but it's also optionless as file-roller simpleton. Then I searched for file-roller alternatives which I might call from Nautilus actions: \n\n\n*\n\n*PeaZip\nIt doesn't support arguments and has ugly GUI. I don't understand why developers don't use system theme api, and after that provide themes if they think that's cool. Not mentioning I don't see point of GUI themes for archive manager? Removed immediately\n\n*Freearc\nGUI client can't be used with arguments, so I can't use it for my task. Other then that has lot of options. I let it be, and decide later what to do with it\n\n*Other?  \nWriting multiple scripts for Nautilus actions is dumb. Zenity does not offer more then single input box, or single list or single... Writing TK python script does not look good and I don't know GTK to do better\nSeems like dead end :(\n\nA: You may also try using B1 Free Archiver. I am not an IT-professional or something but B1 is 100% free,  very easy-to-use and what I love most of all - its stylish and polished interface. Take a look at b1.org, you might like it :)\n\nA: It's not what I had in mind, but until I learn GTK basics I made bash script for Nautilus using Zenity dialog, called \"Compress to 7z\"\nNautilus script should be placed in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and be made executable to be usable\nIn action:\n\nEvoked Zenity dialog:\n\nIt accepts common files and folder including ones with spaces.

By also using -a it appends the groups you give.\nSo this should work (and does, for me, just tried it):\nusermod -aG vboxusers myusername\n\nIf running that command takes you out of any other group then you've found a bug. Note you have to relogin to see the effects.\n\nA: Never use the top method to add a user to vboxusers by using the usermod -G vboxusers myusername command. This will make you lose your sudo privileges!\nIf you have lost your sudo privileges, you can use the method described here to recover them. It boils down to executing the following command:\nusermod -G adm,cdrom,sudo,dip,plugdev,lpadmin,guoshicheng,vboxusers myusername\n\n\nA: What you want to do is just open the terminal and vi /etc/group then add of replace vboxusers:x:128:uname (uname of the account), save and log out. Just login and open VirtualBox, Settings -> USB -> Add filter from device. I think it will work.\n\nA: To add a user to multiple groups use the following command is executed with commas seperating each group for example: admin,vboxusers\nuseradd -G admin,vboxusers myusername\n", "Q: Is there a ticker application available?

I am using Ubuntu for a quite long time now. I am concern about laptop getting hot. So i would like to know is it safe to have ACPI temperature 90 C ? Or it could damage my laptop ?\n\nA: ACPI temperature is most likely your motherboard temperature - not the CPU. Mobile CPUs temp limit is usually little above 100C - depending on CPU type. Example i5 spec - see Tjuntion temperature.  I would say that 90C ACPI temp is bit too high unless under heavy load like gaming. If the temp is at the level all the time I would suggest getting your laptop serviced or cleanning it up by yourself if you know how.\n\nA: It's not dangerous really as like others have said the PC will automatically power off if it gets too hot. Just make sure to backup and save regularly and maybe think about cleaning the fan. Another thing is to check your HDD life using one of the many tools out there as when I had this problem of high temperatures and overheating it turned out the HDD was near the end of it's life and this puts more strain on other components. \n", "Q: Lirc, irxevent: Why doesn't it work with Nautilus?

It is an editor for LaTeX that has really nice features for entering formulas. It is available for Ubuntu.\nI would personally go with the second option, but I am biased due to working a lot with LaTeX.\nAs for drawing, I would recommend inkscape -- it's a drawing program that you obviously operate mostly with the mouse, but everything (line lengths, positions, colors, etc.) can be edited with the keyboard as well. It also has really good support for aligning objects in the drawings, so mouse precision is not needed either.

The name of this folder actually is not \"Home\". This folder is named /home/ in the filesystem. /home is the folder which contains all the users Home-folders. (Which explains why you need sudo to do anything there.) /home/username is the personal folder of that user. \nSo, you can type cd /home/ and press tab to see which options you have (or if you're the only user it will autocomplete your username). ls /home will list all the files and folders in /home.

I am planning to start a company to sell Open Source Software solutions, like Ubuntu in enterprise space. I have around 6 years of experience in IT and Software sales, so I think this is the right time for me to make an entrepreneurial move. Since I love FOSS and want to contribute to the development of FOSS and especially Ubuntu (through business development)since I know that the only way companies like Canonical make money is by selling their Open Source solutions in enterprises (support and trainings). \nI don't have any direct experience in the Linux/open source development, neither by qualification nor by work experience, but I have an experience of using and troubleshooting Linux from around 8 years, I think I have good enough knowledge to train and support Linux desktop. And I have IT and Software sales experience too.\nMy Question is what are the requirements of Canonical for partnering with a company, especially with people with my experience ? And how should I approach Canonical for such a partnership?\nSecondly what are the barriers and challenges starting a business providing open source solutions ?\nI would be Highly thankful if somebody who had such a contact/discussion with canonical, or is in the business of selling Open source solutions, or have any knowledge about this issue, could guide me in this regard. \n\nA: I am not affiliated with Canonical, nor do I represent them in any way. Though there are representatives on this site, I don't think this is the place for those questions. They do have a website you might want to look at. Particularly the Reseller Partner Programme. It includes a form that you can simply fill out, and they'll get in contact with you. You'll simply fill out name, addresses, what kind of partnership you're interested in and a description of your ideas. All encounters I've had with people from Canonical have been very friendly, so don't be afraid to contact them. \nYou might want to buy your penguin a new hat though. :)\nThis is where it becomes more generic. First of all, you should know that you're not required to partner up with Canonical in order to sell Ubuntu or services for it. However, they do own the trademark and other branding materials, so you'll have to read up on that. You'll probably want to partner with them so you can have an \"intellectual upstream\" to lean on when things get difficult. And they have some nice software that's not generally available that you might want to provide to your customers. \nIf your goal is to provide training to users, I would consider getting a certification if possible. LPI can provide that. They also have partnership programs. I'd check that out if I were you. There used to be an Ubuntu specific certification, but I don't think that exists anymore. \nAs every other upstart, you'll want to have a good plan. You need to know exactly what services you wish to provide, who you're going to provide it to, etc. Whether your goal is to attract customers or to enter partnerships, a good plan will be of great value and help create a good impression.

How can I do this?\nJust using pip to install pyramid does not work, so how can I change the version it is downloading to?\n\nA: Alternatively, if you want to install specific version of the package with the specific version of python, this is the way\n sudo python2.7 -m pip install pyudev=0.16\n\nIf the \"=\" doesnt work, use \"==\"\n sudo python2.7 -m pip install pyudev=0.16\n\nOuput: Invalid requirement: 'pyudev=0.16' = is not a valid operator. Did you mean == ?\n sudo python2.7 -m pip install pyudev==0.16\n\nworks fine\n\nA: Each python binary should have its own pip executable.\nYou get one automatically if you use virtualenv. Then you could just run pip install pyramid in an activated virtualenv e.g.:\n$ vex venv pip install pyramid\n\nIf you want to use pip to install for a system python3 then you could install pip for it:\n$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n\nIt installs pip3 program. Then:\n$ pip3 install --user pyramid\n\ninstalls pyramid in ~/.local directory tree.\nIf you need to test a Python package on several python versions; you could use tox.\n\nA: If you get pip3.8 installed this way:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61717006/pip-for-python-3-8\nMore specifically:\ncurl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\npython3.8 get-pip.py\n\nThen you can add this to your .bashrc file:\npip3.8() {\n  python3.8 -m pip \"$@\"\n}\n\nAfter creating a new terminal session simply install packages with:\npip3.8 install xyz\n\nWhich will place your custom python packages in something like: /home/youruser/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages\n\nA: You have two options, but either way, you need to get easy_install-3.2. Since it doesn't seem to be packaged, you have to install it yourself. Fortunately that's easy. And you should also get python3-pkg-resources, which is packaged:\nsudo apt-get install python3-pkg-resources\nwget http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py\nsudo python3 distribute_setup.py\n\nNow you can just use easy_install-3.2 to install Pyramid, or go ahead and install pip in Python3.\nOPTION 1:\nsudo easy_install-3.2 pyramid\n\nOPTION 2:\nsudo easy_install-3.2 pip\nsudo pip-3.2 install pyramid\n\n\nA: In the case where you have installed a separate user-only version of Python by downloading and extracting the tar.gz from the Python.org Downloads page and done a:-\ntar -xzf Python-x.x.x.tar.gz\ncd Python-x.x.x/\n./configure\nmake\n\nYou can use get-pip to install and run pip for this Python install only. \nDownload it with curl as per the git-pip instructions. Then, within your Python-x.x.x/ directory, run:\n./python -m get-pip.py --user\n./python -m pip install pyramid --user\n\n", "Q: How to resume an svn download? I was trying to download a very big package using svn. It got interrupted after about an hour due to internet connection failure. Now when I have restored the connection is it possible to resume the download from the point where it earlier left?\nI used the following command to begin the download\ncd ~/<your_working_dir> svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/branches/2.3\n\nright now the terminal window is still as shown\n\n\nA: As soon as you have started the check out, subversion creates working copy meta data in the folder.\nThus, you can run svn up <wc-dir>. After a terminated operation however, you might need to run svn cleanup <wc-dir> first.\n", "Q: Shutdown 3G modem How can I shutdown 3G modem (ttyUSB0)?\nBecause even when I shutting down I see the lights on it. \nSo maybe my question is : how I can eject 3G modem.\nOr how I can unmount it.\nHelp me to find out in my question and in the solution.\n\nA: Even if you unmount or eject it the Modem will still have lights on as the USB will still feed it power so nothing to worry about Ubuntu won't use it unless it's all connected so when you shut it down Ubuntu will no longer use it until next reboot or if you pull it out and reconnect\n", "Q: Xubuntu Applications Menu still shows deleted applications I originally installed Ubuntu 11.10 on a 64 bit PC, then installed the Xubuntu Desktop.

Luckily someone elsewhere has answered your 'how do I delete a login option' question.\n", "Q: How do I install the latest Nvidia drivers via the Additional Drivers tool? Well obviously I can do it manually, I was just wondering why aren't these drivers available through \"Additional Drivers\", and why are the versions available there outdated.\n\nA: Since it's an old (2015) question the previous answers are a bit outdated. The system76-dev/stable ppa does not seem up to date. Proprietary NVIDIA drivers are removed from bleeding edge xorg-edgers PPA but can be found now in the graphics-drivers PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nhttps://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\n\nA: Drivers in the Additional Tool will never be updated to higher versions unless there is a very big issue with them. You need to either add the PPA or update manually.\nUpon a Ubuntu release packages are frozen in time only to be updated in case of major problems and bugs. Adding this PPA will update your drivers to the latest versions using packages packed by the Ubuntu team.\nThe System 76 folks maintain a PPA with just the nvidia drivers in them, so you can use this for just about any machine with an nvidia driver. The nice thing is they keep this PPA up to date with the latest upstream nvidia driver, making this PPA ideal for gamers.\nIf you already have the drivers installed in your system via the Additional Drivers tool\nAdd the System76 driver PPA (that includes Nvidia drivers)\nsudo add-apt-repository -ys ppa:system76-dev/stable\n\nUpdate and upgrade\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install system76-driver-nvidia\n\nThen either restart the X server or reboot.\nHow to remove/uninstall these drivers\nInstall ppa-purge\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nPurge the system76 team PPA\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:system76-dev/stable\n\n\nA: The xorg-edgers PPA also works well. From what I understand, this is a PPA that posts the latest proprietary Nvidia drivers. To install, open a terminal and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow you should have drivers listed in the Additional Drivers tool.\nThe only thing I don't get is, when you go to Additional Drivers, why are the proprietary drivers listed as open source? \nTo Uninstall\nInstall ppa-purge:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nPurge the Edgers' PPA:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n\nA: Try looking for a PPA. Basically anything in the repos is tested and generally all works the latest versions take time to come through. Some NVIDIA drivers are also classed as experimental so wouldn't be suitable for a novice end user who might stumble across them in additional drivers to install. So a good way of getting the latest and greatest is by seeing if someone has made a PPA by googling.

DSC00003.JPG\n\n...so... are these files all toast, or is there something I can do?\nUPDATE:\nI tried using ddrescue on a file, but got an Input/output error there aswell.\n\nA: First off, I strongly suggest you attempt to do an entire drive image copy of the damaged drive.  You'll need a hard drive at least as large as the partition you are trying to recover.  Assuming the partition of that drive is listed in /dev as /dev/sda2, you would mount the backup drive to (say) /mnt/restore\nFrom there, you'd use the command: dd bs=4096 if=/dev/sda2 of=/mnt/restore/sda2.img conv=noerror,sync\nThis creates an image of the hard drive, including it's 'bad' blocks (if any, as it sounds there are.)  \nNext, disconnect the drive; a damaged drive only gets worse as it's used.  \nNext, you'll need to install testdisk:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\nAccept it's request for untrusted sources (if you're so inclined.)\nFinally, run test\nFrom here, you'll need to use testdisk to find and recover files:\ntestdisk /mnt/restore/sda2.img\nThe menu is pretty self-explanatory, but using test disk is probably beyond the scope of this 'answer.'  Here's a good place to get started:\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/data_recovery_with_testdisk\nThese should help you recover your files, and won't do any more damage to your hard drive than necessary.  Once you've done as much recovery as you can from the image file, you can safely delete it.  You could then try running test disk on the damaged drive directly, and try recovering only the files that are absolutely missing.\nBest of luck to you.\n\nA: You might want to make sure you have the hfsplus package installed: sudo apt-get install hfsplus\nThough, if you can get to that point then I'm sure you already do. What generally is going on in these scenarios is that the hard drive is failing at that point. You might want to check dmesg | grep -i \"I/O error\" for any output. Any output there would almost be a positive of disk failure. Also, if you want more proof you can open the drive inside \"Disk Utility\" and click the \"Smart Data\" button. Check your \"Reallocated Sector count\" and \"Seek Error Rate\". Or you can just look for red dots.\nLet me know if this doesn't help fix your problem.\nPS: Did you let the disk dry completely?\n\nA: ddresucue isn't something you use to read individual files, it's best used for copying the entire disk (well the readable portions) onto a working drive. Then you can try and repair it, or dig around and extract files, without worrying that the drive is about to die.\n", "Q: Which desktop environment to use if Unity test on 11.04 didn't run well on one test?

I've got a question about LibreOffice that's been bugging me since OpenOffice:\nThe versions of LO that come on the Ubuntu disc or from the PPA always have nice font rendering, but whenever I download and install the debs from the LO website, the font rendering in those versions looks terrible.  \nI know the Ubuntu builds include various patches and tweaks that aren't in the vanilla debs, but could anyone help educate me about exactly how the Ubuntu builds of LO differ from the vanilla debs of LO, and if there is an easy way to apply those changes to the vanilla debs so I don't have to wait so long for the PPA to update with the new version?\n\nA: You can see how the distro builds are done by using the:\napt-get source libreoffice\n\ncommand. That said, up to LibreOffice3.4/Oneiric both Debian and Ubuntu used the go-oo build system, which is scary for the uninitiated (and perhaps even more so for the initiated).\nSince LibreOffice-3.5, we (Debian/Ubuntu) are using the native build system of LibreOffice and have most of our patches upstreamed, while keeping only a smaller set of truely vendor-specific patches in our packaging.

If i was going to buy a new laptop or pc which would be better if i would only install Ubuntu?\nI've read some articles about Ubuntu booting really fast with ARM and on their new 12.04 they promised 2seconds boot time.\nwhich would be better if i was only looking forward to fast loading like opening apps and booting and shut down fast?\n\nA: Since you're looking for optimization for speed, that will go more likely to the hard drive. Hard drives are tipically sorted on two actual general options. 5400RPM hard drives are cheaper, and generally you get laptops with that. (Watch out since you may pay lots of $$ for a big sized hdd with slow speed.)\n7200RPM hard drives have a better speed, but they've a more expensive price.\nSSD drives are something totally different. SSDs make your boot amazingly faster, (watch some youtube videos of comparisons). SSDs are very reliable, make no-noise. However, SSDs are way too expensive, and they usually sort small capacity drives.\nYou should check what are your needs in order to know what kind of drive you need.\nOn the other hand, ARM processors have some architectural limits, as far as I know, Ubuntu on ARM will not let you get flash-video and other vital stuff. Still ARM is a very hard-to-warm processor. That's why tablets don't have fans, like laptops.\nAs for today, Windows 7 will not run on any ARM processor. (Win8 is supposed to do so.)\nCommon processor architectures, (x86, for 32-bit, x64, for 64-bit) are the tipical and most recommended choices. They are compatible for anything in general. Also they are SUPPOSED to be faster, (might as well be that ARM processors usually have low clock speeds). I recommend you getting a x64 processor, either from AMD or INTEL.\nIf you need anything except hardcore gaming, go INTEL, they architecture is proven to be a little step ahead to AMD's. However, AMD's crossfire technology (make the AMD processor work hand to hand with a ATI graphics chipset) is something to considerate). \nIf you do worry about heating, AMD's brand new APU (combination of graphics card and processor into a single chipset) is really great at keeping things cool.\nBut you now, over every actual processor, (Intel Core i' series or AMD A' series), most speed for opening things comes more from the hard drive on your system.\nI know it may be confusing, but I just tried to explain everything so you can go for your best choice. Good luck! ;)\n\nA: ARM is only for mobile devices (I think). I'm using AMD A6, and it's great. Intel Core i3 is very fast too (and of course, i5 and i7 are even faster). It depends on your budget :)\n\nA: Intel x86 and x64 are almost universally faster than ARM.  This is not necessarily in clock, but in general 'goodies' you get along side.  ARM based solutions usually have 1 GB or less in ram and lower clock.  You'll also get a lot more stable packages in x86 or x64.  ARM support is lacking in a lot of areas.  It boots and runs, but it's not there yet.\n", "Q: Gtk-Warnings In Terminal \nPossible Duplicate:\nGtk warning when opening Gedit in terminal \n\nI have Ubuntu 11.10 installed on two different machines, both using x64 installs. Only one machine returns these Gtk warnings after using sudo gedit. I get these warnings when opening or saving a file.\nHere is an example:\n(gedit:2456): Gtk-WARNING **; Attempting to store changes into '/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed: Failed to create file '/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel.KBGV9V': No such file or directory\nI also get another set of warnings related to \"Attempting to set permissions of\" the above mention directory.\nIs this something I should be concerned with? Any way to get rid of those warnings? Like I said, my other machine doesn't return these warnings in the terminal.\n\nA: As far as the warning go.....they are just that. \nIf you are using gedit as a superuser then I would recommend using gksudo instead\nCLI=sudo\nGUI=gksudo\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the difference between sudo and gksu the same as the difference\nbetween sudo -i and sudo -s?\nThe reason for root permissions. See the tutorial\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo\n\nA: To get rid of the warning if it hasn't gone away yet you can create the directory(s) that are missing, as in\nsudo mkdir -p /root/.local/share\n\nOr the 1st time you delete anything as sudo it will also be created if you send to the root trash\n", "Q: Failed to download repository information after updating I have a warning sign on the upper bar, a red triangle and an exclamation inside. I click this icon and I am informed that there are updates and the \"Show updates\" option is available. I click on \"Show updates\" and I am informed that the package information was last updated 78 days ago. I am prompted to click the check button for new updates. I click the check button and it says \"updating cache\" and after a moment a \"Failed to download repository information\" message appears.\nThis was the result of the execution of\"sudo apt-get update | grep NO_PUBKEY:\n\nW: Failed to fetch ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/source/â¦ 404 Not Found W: Failed to fetch ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/â¦ 404 Not Found E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nThis situation has been happening often. What should I do? \n\nA: You are trying to update OpenJDK from a PPA; that should not be needed anymore since now OpenJDK is in the main Ubuntu repositories. The maintainers of that PPA have therefore decided not to provide OpenJDK for Oneiric, that's why you are getting an error when trying to update the package lists.\nTo fix the error, open the editor of your choice.  Super User permissions are needed though.\nOpen this file /etc/apt/sources.list\nFind the lines (if any) that contain something similar to:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk oneiric main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk oneiric main\nand remove them entirely. \nAfter this is done Save the file and run the following command:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThis should fix your problem.\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+t open a terminal and run the code here:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf the above fails to update then: \nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nPlease post back any errors if any.\n\nA: Sounds like you may have some repositories that have no public keys, which are causing the download of certain packages to be aborted.\nRun the following command from a terminal. Take note of the alpha-numeric keys returned on the screen:\nsudo apt-get update | grep NO_PUBKEY\n\nIf there is a value returned run this command replacing the area in quotations with the value returned but without quotes.  Do this for each key:\nsudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \"INPUTKEY HERE\"\n\nAfter this is done run update:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: The sources for those PPA's does not exist. Oneiric is not listed.\nYou need to remove those lines from the software sources.list\nFirst thing is to back up your sources.list\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup\n\nNow edit the file. Look for the offending line, it would look like this example:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu natty main \ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu natty main  \nTo edit use the following:\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nYou want to comment out the lines using the \"#\" and make it look like this:\n#deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu natty main \n#deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu natty main \nSave the file. Then run this code:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nyou should be good-to-go now\n\nA: I had this same problem, I back tracked what I was doing because it was working correctly until I did an edit to /etc/network/interface from dhcp to static, I changed it back to dhcp and all repos started working again. \n", "Q: Making nautilus/cp/scp/rsync \"progress\" cache-aware When transferring moderately large files (~500-800 MB) to/from a USB disk in nautilus, or using (s)cp (with progress bar from http://chris-lamb.co.uk/2008/01/24/can-you-get-cp-to-give-a-progress-bar-like-wget/), or when using rsync... the progress reported is far from accurate. Evidently the default file system cache size in ubuntu 11.10 64bit is quite a bit larger than for 32 bit. As a consequence, it appears to nautilus or rsync or whatever is doing the copying that the file has been completely copied, when in fact there is a large portion of the file left to write, but that entire portion is has been cached, so it appears to the program that the file has been written (i.e. because it has, from the perspective of system calls). However, the actual output file takes a good 10-20 seconds more to actually fill up. Is there anyway to tweak any of these pieces of software to report progress in terms of \"how much data has been written to the actual output file\" instead of \"how much data has been written to the operating system\".\nMy particular annoyance is that each of these programs reports that the file has been written, but then just hangs for a while reporting nothing. I suspect this is because the \"write\" system call has completed, but the \"close file\" system call is waiting for the cache to flush.\n\nA: I use ubuntu 11.10 64-bit as well. You can use lsof command to poll and see if the cache has been written. This command lists which processes/commands keep files open.

This has made my Dropbox folder unworkable. I have removed U1 from all my PCs but the Dropbox folder continues to add the suffix.\n\nA: \"After using Ubuntu One and Dropbox for a while I conclude that Dropbox is a stable and reliable product that can largely be ignored once setup. For me this is really important. I choose to use Linux because it is a great operating system: simple to install and simple to use. Any service I use (whether itâs free or not) must perform as expected and improve my productivity. In a nutshell, Dropbox does this for me and Ubuntu One does not. Ubuntu One is unreliable and frustrating to use. This could be forgiven had Canonical decided not to market it as a fully functioning and complete service. With this in mind cost really doesnât come into the equation. Yes, Dropbox can cost you more but then as the old adage goes you usually get what you pay for.

The terminal is used for entering commands and you must know the device name/partition of the installed system (sda1, sdb5, etc). The problem partition is located and mounted from the LiveCD. The files are then copied from the LiveCD libraries to the proper locations and MBR. If, for example Windows is on sda1 and Ubuntu is on sda5, and Windows has overwritten the MBR, then the target for grub installation will be /dev/sda5, and the MBR in the boot sector of sda will be re-written for grub.\nThis operation will write to the MBR and restore the modules and core.img to /boot/grub. It will not replace or restore grub.cfg or fix corrupted files.\nBoot the LiveCD Desktop.\n\nOpen a terminal window.\n\nDetermine the partition with the Ubuntu installation. The fdisk option \"-l\" is a lowercase \"L\".\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIf you're not sure of the partition, look for one of the appropriate size or formatting.\nRunning sudo blkid may provide more information to help locate the proper partition, especially if the partitions are labeled. The device/drive is designated by sdX, with X being the device designation. sda is the first device, sdb is the second, etc. For most users the MBR will be installed to sda, the first drive on their system. The partition is designated by the Y. The first partition is 1, the second is 2. Note the devices and partitions are counted differently. \n    Mount the partition containing the Ubuntu installation.\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nExample: sudo mount /dev/sda1 Note: If the user has a separate /boot partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/boot Note: If the user has a separate /home partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/home. Encrypted home partitions should work.\nRun the grub-install command as described below. This will reinstall the GRUB 2 files on the mounted partition to the proper location and to the MBR of the designated device.\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX\n\nExample: sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/ /dev/sda\n\nReboot\nRefresh the GRUB 2 menu with \nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Internet connection is sluggish I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 on a desktop computer with an Ethernet connection.\nPc specifications:\nAMD Sempron 145 Sargas 2.8GHz Socket AM3 45W Single-Core Desktop Processor SDX145HBGMBOX,\n2-2Gb of ram; 4Gb in total,\nBiostar TA880GB+ Motherboard,\n300Gb SATA-Hard Drive,\nOs- Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit\nMy computer's internet connection seems a bit sluggish, even though it is on an Ethernet connection.

See http://www.dslreports.com/faq/7801 and http://www.dslreports.com/faq/5793\nThe MTU is the Maximum Transmission Unit (see this)\nIf your MTU is too large, every TCP packet you send will be broken into TWO (or more) packets, and you'll experience slowth.\n\nA: There might be a couple of things.\nFirst, Ubuntu might be trying to talk IPv6. Normally that's not an issue, but it can be if your network equipment is old, misconfigured, or just lower end. A quick Google search reveals how to to do this.\nIf IPv6 isn't the problem, you might try changing nameservers. Go to the application called Network Connections and edit your connection. From there, go to the IPv4 tab and choose \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\".

That means that the Desktop folder would not be in /home/username/Desktop but in /Desktop which would be the error here.\nIn your case and everybody else, the Desktop folder is normally in the /home/username/Desktop.\nSo if you open the terminal and you are already in your user directory, for example /home/username then you only need to just type cd Desktop because you are already in the directory where desktop is.\nIf you were in for example /var/www and you want to go to your desktop you would type one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ~/Desktop which is the same as typing /home/username/Desktop because the ~ will by default point you to the directory of your username.

I have a Lucid Server (10.04) set up and I would like to change the mirror from US (or any other country) to the Main Ubuntu Mirror.\nFor example my two first entries in sources.list are:\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted\n\nIn a Desktop environment I would select the main mirror like this:\n\nBut how do I do that from the terminal as I don't have a graphical environment installed!\n\nA: This command should do the trick:\nsudo sed -i 's|http://us.|http://|g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIt will remove the 'us.' prefix in each of the addresses to convert them to addresses of the main server. \nOf course replace 'us' by any other mirror you are using.\nIn depth explanation of command:\nsed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text.\n\n\n*\n\n*The -i argument is to edit a file in place. \n\n*Then 's|regexp|replacement|g', s specifying the search and\nreplace command.\n\n*The g at the end being the argument to \"globally\" search.\n\n*Conclusion: replaces all occurrences of http://us. with http:// in the file /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\nA: Correct sed usage to remove/change country code \"us\" from source.list to something else like \"au\", the command will be as follows:\nsed -i 's/http:\\/\\/us./http:\\/\\/au./g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nor just to remove \"us\" alone instead of changing it to something, use code below:\nsed -i 's/http:\\/\\/in./http:\\/\\//g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\nA: With vim:\nmv /etc/apt/sources.list{,.bak}   # you may want to make a backup\nvim /etc/apt/source.list\n\nType : (you need to hold Shift) to enter command-ine mode, and then type:\n%s/http:\\/\\/us\\./http:\\/\\//g\n\nHit Enter\nHit Esc to be sure you've exited the command-line mode and entered normal mode.

I suppose the question applies to Linux in general but what have user's experiences been with Asus Xonar U3? Does it improve the sound quality of onboard or the generic drivers cripple it?\n\nA: My experience with the Xonar U3 and 11.10 on a Samsung RV511 laptop has been very good. \nInstallation is dead simple, just plug in and go to Sound Preferences (right click on Sound icon) and the hardware, input and output tabs selecting in turn the USB Advanced Audio Device. And there you have it, a noticeably improved sound output, haven't used the Xonar with a mic yet so I can't comment on the input capabilities of the Xonar. \nThe Xonar can also be accessed through alsamixer, not sure whether this is any different to using the Sound Preferences (probably not).\n\nA: It is supported well as any USB-sound device. Long story: by default I've experienced problem with this sound card (clicking sound). After some investigations I found the problem (wrong sample rate) and here is the solution:\nBy default sample rate has been was set to 44100 which is wrong for this card. To check your configuration run this:\npacmd list-sinks\n\nIf it does not display: sample spec: s16le 2ch 48000Hz for your card, you'll need to change it to 48000 in ~/.pulse/daemon.conf by (creating directory and new file if needed) this line should be added (just single line is OK!):\ndefault-sample-rate = 48000\n\nAfter this sound quality greatly improves and clicking sounds disappear.\nAlso, both 14.04 and 16.04 sometimes don't switch the output (even worse, sometimes Dummy output appears). Solution:\npulseaudio -k\n\n(once you insert the card). I use pavucontrol to tune volume.\n\nA: I have used this device in Ubuntu 11.10 and my experience is that it does improve the sound quality and adds a lot more power to the output (Acer Extensa laptop). Of course the actual improvement depends on the quality of the onboard sound chip.\nUnfortunately the Xonar U3 Audio Center SW doesn't support Linux but the device is usable also without it.\n\nA: I have installed the Xonar U3 on a Raspberry PI using raspian and kernel 3.10.25. I can confirm that the device shows up and both the analog audio out and microphone in are working properly.\nHowever, the optical (S/PDIF) output does not work in my hands. Alsamixer shows a \"Digital\" switch, and I can turn the S/PDIF laser on and off with it, but no sound can be heard when I plug the S/PDIF toslink table into my stereo (stereo and cable are confirmed good). \n\nA: It is supported. However, volume control doesn't work with analog headphone output in my experience. You have to enable SPDIF to fix this issue, but it can be done only on MS Windows and it isn't persistent, hence if your computer reboots without the sound card plugged in, you lose visibility of the digital output... until you enable it in MS Windows again.\n\nA: I just tried to plug it in because the audio jack of my mainboard does not output any signals. As soon as i plug it in ubuntu is not able to boot anymore.\nI get the error \"Failed to start Load Kernel Modules\"\nUbuntu: 16.04.3 (4.13.0-21-generic)\nMainboard: ASUS M5A97 LE R2.0\nWhen i unplug the device i am able to boot but since i plugged it in i have some errors when booting (systemd, see error above)\nI dont know if it is related to the usb device or if the sound chip is broken and that causes some problem. Windows is able to boot just fine and if i plug in the usb sound card i have sound.\nI just wanted to add this for others, there MIGHT be issues with newer linux kernels.\n", "Q: Laptop SIM card slot not recognized My laptop, Lenovo T520 has a Sim Card Slot that can be revealed when removing the battery.

I used Brasero and K3b and none would work, it would show an error every time somewhere near the 70% mark and the error would be something like it can't access cdrom or something. Try to fix it through some instructions on the forums but it wouldn't work still.\nAny help?\nI'm running 11.10 on a 64bit machine.\nThank y'all in advance guys!\n\nA: Try burning the CD at a slower (preferable the slowest) speed. That often prevents burn failures, as well as reducing the frequency of corrupted burns that appear fine until you try to use them.\nAdjusting Burn Speed in Brasero\nIn Brasero, you can adjust the burning speed by clicking Properties in the Image Burning Setup window (i.e., in the window that comes up right before the burn).\nYou can select a slower speed in the Burning speed drop down menu, near the top of the Preferences dialog.\n\nYou won't necessarily have the same options shown there, as this depends in part on your CD/DVD burner.\nAdjusting Burn Speed in K3b\nIn K3b, you can adjust the burn speed in the same window where you tell it what image to burn.\n\nWithout more details in the question, this is likely the most effective solution that can be suggested for burns that fail to complete or are corrupted. It's often especially useful to reduce burn speed if you are at all unsure about the physical media to which you're burning, or if if you are burning a file containing data that will use most of its value if slightly corrupted (like computer programs, or an operating system).\n\nA: Try ImgBurn in Wine, it works very well. Otherwise look for Nero 4 for Linux\n", "Q: Ubuntu project files and directories documentation When you download some larger project, there is usually the documentation describing what is in individual files and directories and its purpose.\nI can't find this information for the main (controlling) part of Ubuntu project.\nMoreover I can't find some readme file in the project describing it. Does this officially exist? Could you post me a link? (This would be extremely difficult to answer it without a link).\nI have also found similar question but it's depricated and doesn't answer my question, so I asked rather this question (I also consulted it with a moderator of this portal yesterday).\n\nA: From what I could understand, you want to know about Ubuntu itself and not the repositories.\nAn installation of Ubuntu uses the most common directory structure for Linux-based operating systems, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. Its official documentation can be found in:\nhttp://www.pathname.com/fhs/\nIf you don't need much more than basic information, though, the Wikipedia article on FHS might be a quicker introduction:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard\nIf instead of an installation you are talking about source code, Ubuntu has no such thing as a single directory structure. This is because Ubuntu is a huge, modular collection of several different softwares, each one with its own structure.\nIn other words, you can't find what you are looking for unless you are more specific: \"directory structure of the kernel\", \"directory structure of the file manager\", \"directory structure of the music player\", \"directory structure of the web browser\", and so on.\n", "Q: .profile ran into an infinite loop I changed my .profile to run a script at startup.

When I use apps like Deluge, Transmission or KTorrent, the wifi stop working!\nSomeone know why?\n(sorry for my english, in not a native)\n\nA: A lot of wifi connections and their routers fall over if you throw too many connections at them and a lot of bittorrent clients are set to unlimited connections by default. As soon as you start something up, it'll try to connect to 600 peers and everything implodes.\nFairly simple fix: limit the number of connections. I'd suggest a global max of 100 and ~60 half-open connections. I have had bad routers that only support half that so you might need to rein it in even more. In my experience this doesn't usually hurt your speed.\nYou might also want to limit the upload bandwidth. I've got 1mbps (128KB/s) upload but anything over 50KB/s slows things down. I limit my upload to 20KB/s and everything keeps on going.\n\n\n*\n\n*Deluge: Edit â Preferences â Bandwidth.\n\n*Transmission: Read this for editing config files and set\n\n*\n\n*peer-limit-global: Number (default = 240)\n\n*peer-limit-per-torrent: Number (default = 60)\n\n\n*Ktorrent: No idea.

Now, network is back up again but I guess some packages remain not configured (at least the flash-plugin never finished).\nHow can I resume the update-process where it stopped or reconfigure the downloaded packages?\nUbuntu 11.10 x86_64\n\nA: You should open a terminal and type :\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nThis should do the trick.\n", "Q: Unable to transfer files via bluetooth between a Samsung Corby TXT and laptop I successfully paired my laptop & my phone.

This\n  file is called .gnuplot on Unix and AmigaOS systems, and GNUPLOT.INI\n  on other systems. If this file is not found in the current directory,\n  the program will look for it in the HOME directory (under AmigaOS,\n  Atari(single)TOS, MS-DOS, Windows and OS/2, the environment variable\n  GNUPLOT should contain the name of this directory; on Windows NT, it\n  will use USERPROFILE if GNUPLOT isnât defined). Note: if NOCWDRC is\n  defined during the installation, gnuplot will not read from the\n  current directory.\nIf the initialization file is found, gnuplot executes the commands in\n  it. These may be any legal gnuplot commands, but typically they are\n  limited to setting the terminal and defining frequently-used functions\n  or variables.\n\nwhich means that it reads into your home directory if the file is not found BUT it also checks for the GNUPLOT variable which contains the name of this directory. So just jumping into a conclusion I have not tested since I do not have gnuplot but yo might like to try it you can do something like this in the terminal:\nGNUPLOT = /home/user/gnuplot that way you set the GNUPLOT variable to that particular value. Before doing this I recommend to see what value GNUPLOT has before. type this: echo $GNUPLOT\nthe other is creating the file the program is looking for in the directory where the program is (gnuplot.ini) and if this file has some variable that tells it where to read, yo might like to try that other method.\n", "Q: How do I reopen an instance window once it has disappeared from desktop? I'm new to Ubuntu. I use Skype and often the main window just disappears from my desktop. The Skype instance itself is still running in the background. I know this because I can see its notifications on the bottom right side of the screen.\nIf I click on the Skype icon again, Ubuntu will launch a new instance instead of maximizing the running instance. Of course this will not work because Skype will not let you sign in: Another instance of Skype may be running.\nHow do I refocus/bring to the foreground the existing Skype instance? In Windows, you can restore running instances through the taskbar. I've tried cycling through open windows, but the running instance window is no where to be seen.\n\nA: I had this problem too. No matter how I set the Skype settings, it would not show in the taskbar. I tried whitelisting it too, but that did not work. What did work (though possibly in combination with whitelisting - I did not try it without) is a solution found in another askubuntu thread. \nsudo apt-get install sni-qt:i386\n\nFollow the link for more details on the matter. \n\nA: It would help to know what version of Ubuntu you are using but Skype has support for the system tray in the menu bar so you might see there a small skype icon. Click on that one and it will show you a huge menu with the option \"Activate\" which is \"Open\" in Skype language.\nThe system tray or top panel is this:\n\nin this case I am using the default Ubuntu desktop (Unity from 11.10) and skype 2.2 Beta\nSome settings that might affect this in Skype are:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Skype minimised in the system tray\n\n*Choose Style\n\n\nAlso as mentioned in the comment above, when you have 2 or more opened skypes they will go crazy. To delete them all and start from the beginning go to a terminal and do this:\nsudo killall skype\n\nIf that does not work do this:\nsudo killall -9 skype\n\nIf that still does not work do this: ps -e| grep skype a process for skype will appear with a number like for example:  \n5859 ?        00:00:11 skype\n\ntake that number and do this: sudo kill -9 5859.\nVarious ways to kill a process. Then just open Skype again.\n\nA: I am unable to get the skype icon on the system tray as well.\nHowever, there is a workaround which partly works for me.\nIn Ubuntu 12.4 LTS, \nYou can lock Skype icon to the launcher. The icon stays there.\nWhen you click on it, it shows the currently running instance.\nIf skype is not running, it starts the application.\nI would still like to have it in my tab switcher.\n\nA: In Unity, by default only certain applications are allowed to put icons into the panel.  You can allow Skype's notification icon to appear by modifying the config.\nThe easiest way to do this is to use dconf-editor from the dconf-tools package.  Use the tool to browse to desktop...unity...panel and change systray-whitelist parameter to ['all'] .  This will allow all icons to show.  Alternatively, you could add 'skype' to the list.\nHowever, I still have a problem where Skype sometimes manages to hide itself completely, in spite of appearing in the panel to begin with.\n", "Q: Screencast on Ubuntu 11.10 I'm trying to make a screencast in Ubuntu 11.10.\nI need to insert some text for explaining all the steps. Something like this.\nI looked for older questions and I saw that one of the few software that allows you to insert some text in the screencast is wink.\nHowever it doesn't work for me on Ubuntu 11.10. When I try to start the screen cast all the wink Icon disappear from the sidebar and so I'm not able anymore to stop the registration.\nIs there a way for fixing it? Otherwise, is there an alternative software?\nThanks!  \n\nA: I normally record with gtk-recordmydesktop and then that output video I edit with openshot or pitivi (for me preferably openshot). Both of which can add text to a video. Of course not with the yellow background for the text in your link but at least some text somewhere you want and freeze the video for a moment so the viewer has time to read.\n\nA: GNOME 3 has a built in screen recording feature. Just press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R to start and stop recording. The file will appear in your home folder named something like shell-YYYYMMDD-1.webm.\n", "Q: How to check Internet Speed via Terminal? Instead of going to sites like speedtest.net, I want to check my current Internet speed from the terminal on Ubuntu. How can I do it?\n\nA: If you can't be bothered to install iperf , you could precede any command that shifts a known amount of data with the time command and do a sum.\niperf is simple and easy to use.\nIt requires a client and server.\n(on the server)\n user@server$ iperf -s\n\n(on the client)\n user@client$ iperf -c server.domain\n ------------------------------------------------------------\n Client connecting to 192.168.1.1, TCP port 5001\n TCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)\n ------------------------------------------------------------\n [  3] local 192.168.1.3 port 52143 connected with 192.168.1.1 port 5001\n [ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth\n [  3]  0.0-10.0 sec    113 MBytes  94.7 Mbits/sec\n\nMore Details\n\nA: a simple one-liner that tests how long it takes to download 100MB (works on /bin/sh also):\nt=$(date +\"%s\"); wget http://speedtest.tele2.net/100MB.zip -O ->/dev/null ; echo -n \"MBit/s: \"; expr 8 \\* 100 / $(($(date +\"%s\")-$t))\nexplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*store the timestamp in $t\n\n*download 100mb but don't store anything\n\n*calculate 8 * 100mb / $t\n\nA: Well I use wget for it. That little tool tells me nicely what speed I have.\nTo use it just point to a file in internet that is relatively bigger so that you can get a better estimate of it.\nFor example\ntyping: wget http://hostve.com/neobuntu/pics/Ubu1.avi would start to download the Ubu1.avi file and show at what speed it is downloading.\n\nOf course there are several recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Speed test yourself with good servers. In the case of my link the speed is less than 200KB so if you have a higher speed, the server will be the bottleneck for you, not your actual speed.\n\n*The highest speed you will see is the maximum speed that your connection and the server's connection can offer. If your connection is 512KB and the place where you are downloading is 400KB, your max connection will be 400KB because it is the max for the server you are downloading from.\n\n*You need to do the test at least 5 times to have a reliable speed check or at least do it for a minute or two. This will help you have a more accurate check.\n\n*You need to have at least 4 or 5 different testing sources to have a more accurate speed. Never test only from the same site as this can be affected by your distance to it, any problem in the server and the connections to it, etc. Always test from different servers.\nARIA2\nThis is an alternative to wget. The downside of wget is the lack of parallel connections. To use aria2 we fist need to download it:\n   sudo apt-get install aria2\n\nTo use it is simple:\n\nIn the image, the -x 4 is how many parallel connections we wish to use. The CN parameter in the next line shows how many active parallel connections were permitted to download from that site. In this case CN is 4. But if we tried to have more connections we would get something like this:\n\nWe set 8 parallel connections but the site only allowed a maximum of 5 as shown by CN:5. This could be solved by the -j option which tells aria2c the maximum concurrent connections we want (Which by default is 5) but if the server has limited this, -j will not work.\n\nA: Run several instances of wget with timeout command on large files:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntimeout 5 wget -q url_1/100MB.zip &\ntimeout 5 wget -q url_2/file.zip &\ntimeout 5 wget -q url_3/sample.mov &\ntimeout 5 wget -q url_4/speech.mp4 &\n\nAnd then write a script to calculate the total bytes downloaded and divide 5 seconds you will get a bytes/sec figure. Should be quite accurate and you can add more instances to max your bandwidth.\nI have yet to test the full script but the single line command \"timeout 5 wget url\" works, and you get a partially downloaded file as a result (if 5 secs is not enough to complete the download).\n\nA: you can use tespeed . it is a Terminal network speed test that uses servers from Speedtest.net. It uses nearest test server but can also use one manually specified by the user. \n git clone git://github.com/Janhouse/tespeed.git\n cd tespeed\n git submodule init\n git submodule update\n ./tespeed.py \n\n\nfor  more info use :\n ./tespeed.py  -h\n\nit will provide more option for speed test.\n\nA: Actually, Ookla, the provider of Speedtest released a command-line utility that is measuring your speed against a huge number of servers spread around the world. You can find instructions on how to install it on this link and you can use it fairly simple by executing: \nspeedtest -s XXXX -f csv|tsv|jsonl|json|json-pretty\n\nwhere -s sets the server ID against which you want to test your Internet speed, -f is defining the format of the output. I think the most useful information is generated when you use json/json-pretty format for the output because a lot of the information of the test setup isn't printed if you are using the csv/tsv format. Both -s and -f are just optional but if you want to automate your measurement they might be useful. \nIn addition, you can find a list of the servers which speedtest is using on this address in the form of an XML file or on this address with a searchable field: link. \n\nA: Since speedtest-cli is a python application, it is much easier to install by doing:\npip install speedtest-cli\n\nor:\neasy_install speedtest-cli\n\nDepending on how Python is installed on your system, you may need to be root to do the above.\n\nA: Simple bash script based on @rexis answer.

I created a blog post (Measure Internet Connection Speed from the Linux Command Line) that goes into detail of downloading, installing and usage of it.\nThe short version is this: (no root required)\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py | python -\n\nOutput:\nRetrieving speedtest.net configuration...\nRetrieving speedtest.net server list...\nTesting from Comcast Cable (x.x.x.x)...\nSelecting best server based on ping...\nHosted by FiberCloud, Inc (Seattle, WA) [12.03 km]: 44.028 ms\nTesting download speed........................................\nDownload: 32.29 Mbit/s\nTesting upload speed..................................................\nUpload: 5.18 Mbit/s\n\nUpdate in 2016:\nspeedtest-cli is in Ubuntu repositories now.

Not just download speeds\n\n*Eliminate ISP bias and possible tricks they might play to make specific speed-tests appear faster than most other speeds are\n\n*High-level graphical output rather than just numbers. One picture is worth a 1000 words\n\nNot being able to find anything that answered all these requirements, I wrote my own while avoiding reinventing the wheel wherever possible.\nUnder the hood, I used speedtest-cli for the ISP selection and the metrics, and R/ggplot for plotting.  The code has been well tested on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 & 20.04.\nThe output provides the 3 main metrics (download, upload, and ping round-trip times) for the closest 20 data-centers to you (the tester), plus estimated distances and Internet provider names.\nSource code\nAll the code is available from github with howto, examples & my story of looking for better speeds.\nAll this code is CLI based.

So I did the thing I normally do and wrote my own solution:\nhttps://github.com/cubiclesoft/network-speedtest-cli\nFrom the features list:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH/SFTP (port 22) speed testing.\n\n*Common TCP ports 80, 443, and 8080 as well as random TCP port speed testing using a custom TCP/IP server that supports speeds up to 2.2 Gbps down and 780 Mbps up.\n\n*Fairly basic network latency testing.\n\n*Spin up Digital Ocean droplets and speed test SSH/SFTP and various TCP ports.\n\n*Speedtest.net and custom OoklaServer speed testing.  Produces similar results to the single connection tests at single.speedtest.net.\n\n*Pure JSON output in silent mode (-s).\n\n\nIt's a more generic solution that can be consumed by other applications.  I managed to pinpoint an ISP network issue with it that resulted in doubling my SFTP downstream speed, which resulted in increased happiness.\n", "Q: Virtual box : Issue connecting to security.ubuntu.com I have Windows 7 as host system, and installed Ubuntu 11.10 as guest.

Actually, it covers everything you're asking about (icons are part of the theme).\nUbuntu's own OpenBox page isn't bad either! It has a similar amount of information (it does look suspiciously similar!) but there are some Ubuntu-only notes in there too. Some of the information does look a little old (~2006 era), so be careful when basing your changes on the information there.\n\nA: If you're using Gnome/Openbox, you can change the wallpaper under System Settings > Appearance --  I'm running Gnome-do, so I launch system settings that way, though from the terminal you can also launch \"gnome-panel\" which should give you an Applications menu with System Tools > System Settings available. \nThere's also a nice Advanced Settings dialog that I launch with Gnome-do where you can set other options, including iconsets. \n\nA: I suggest using feh to change your desktop. Or you can add \"gnome-settings-daemon &\" to your autostart.sh and change your global desktop from \"appearance settings\".  You can change the cursor with \"sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme\" and gnome-tweak-tool after enabling the Daemon. As for the menu bar, I like to use \"gnome-panel\"....\nNote that both gnome-tweak-tool and gnome-panel require installing the Gnome DE packages.\n", "Q: How can I automatically change spaces to underscores in the file save dialog box?

You could save that as an alias in ~/.bash_aliases like: alias underscore=\"rename 's/ /_/g' *.xls\" and then just run underscore.\nOr you could create a new shortcut/link on your desktop that did something similar. It would probably need to run through Bash so you'd have a command like:\nbash -c \"cd yourXlsDir; rename 's/ /_/g' *.xls\"\n\n", "Q: Where are kernel panic logs? I've got problem with Handbrake/ffmpeg. After ~5 minutes transcoding, the computer locks up. I'm fairly sure it's a kernel panic because caps-lock starts flashing.\nThere are a few logical questions about what to do and some about specific bugs but I'm really after one thing: what happened right before everything died?!\nI've checked /var/log/kern.log and all I see around the time is me sticking in a DVD and then a few minutes later, the system booting up. No errors, no panic notice.\nIs there any way to force panics to be logged? I'm fairly sure I can reproduce this (it's happened 100% of the times I've tried recently) so while I'd rather this \"just worked\", I'm happy enough to reboot a few times if it means I can find the cause of the panic.\n\nA: Serial port\nThe serial port is a simple low level communication mechanism between computers.\nAdvantages:\n\n*\n\n*simple setup once (if you have the hardware)\n\n*reliable, since data transmission only depends on a simple wires and kernel API, which is less likely to be affected by the panic than say, the TCP/IP subsystem.\n\nDownsides:\n\n*\n\n*most modern laptops don't have the serial port anymore (exposed?) to save space. But desktops and virtual machines still do.\n\n*you also need a second computer with serial port as well to receive the data, but this is the case for basically all embedded development boards such as the Raspberry Pi.\n\n*limited by the length of the physical layer serial cable, unlike TCP/IP networks which are unlimited. This can however be worked around by plugging a device that converts between serial and TCP/IP on the serial of the remote computer\n\nThe serial port looks like this:\n\nand on the RPI is available through the GPIO, here's what it looks like (with a USB interface to a laptop on the other side):\n\na uller example of that in use can be seen here.\nThen, if you have the required hardware, connect from the second computer to the main computer with:\nscreen /dev/ttyS0 115200\n\nThis actually gives you a shell.\nThen on the main machine, start the operation that panics.\nWhen the panic happens, the panic dump is streamed over to the second machine, and you can see it all by scrolling up on the terminal.\nOther methods\nThere are also other methods which overcome the hardware limitations mentioned above, at the cost of being more complex and less reliable. Notable methods:\n\n*\n\n*netdump: streams the panic over TCP/IP.

What could possibly go wrong?! :-)\n\nSee also this great answer: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60574/determining-cause-of-linux-kernel-panic\nStep debugging\nUltimately, getting panic output requires that some kernel functionality work, and any kernel functionality could be corrupted by the panic.\nBut who needs panics if you can use GDB on the kernel?

Since the kernel has at this point crashed, writing into the filesystem is a risky operation - not much of the kernel can be trusted anymore, so writes into logs might actually be spewing random crap over your bootloader!\nInstead, you can dump the contents of memory into your swap, and then debug it later. This is known as a kernel crash / core dump.\nThe Ubuntu Wiki has a CrashdumpRecipe that may be useful - though it looks a bit out of date, I don't think too much should have changed.\n\nA: All your system logs in Ubuntu are handled by rsyslog which keeps its configuration in /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/. \nFor more information on how to configure rsyslog and the possible options visit the rsyslog.conf man page.\nOpening /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf you can see that one of the lines contains \n*.*;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslog*\nMeaning that the file you are looking for in this case is any of the huge /var/log/syslog logs you will probably have.\nYou can see that the file name also starts with a -, this means that the file is cached before writing, its great but can leave you with a bad log, what you want is that the log is written as soon as there is a problem.\nRemove the dash and reboot or reload rsyslog and then make your computer crash again, check /var/log/syslog.\n", "Q: How can I search the ubuntu source code? How can I search through the source code used in Ubuntu?\nThere is a notification message that I'd like to modify to include more data, but it's not obvious which package it's a part of.

I know there are a large number of projects included in ubuntu, but I'm hoping there's a good way to find the source when it's not apparent what program is responsible.\n\nA: If it's that specific, Google should be able to help you -- it has indexed tons of publicly available source code. I'd be very surprised if it didn't find something.\nFailing that (or any other sort of web search), strings is a pretty handy little application.

A behavior I tend to attribute to Windows users where they stick to an older version of Windows for a long time (Try to picture somebody staying with Ubuntu 5.10 up until now and asking why it has X problem with it)\nSo what advantages does an end user get when upgrading or installing a newer version or the latest version of Ubuntu and why is something important to be always up to date in the Ubuntu/Linux world.\n\nA: Reasons to stay up-to-date: \n1) Security.  All software has bugs, and code that is exposed to the outside world, either due to being accessible by the outside world (i.e. ssh), reaching out to the outside world (i.e. browsers) or dealing with data you get from the outside world (i.e. gimp opening downloaded images), all of this code can be exploited by virus/malware writers to do bad things to your system.\n2) Bugs.  Even bugs that don't cause security issues can be annoying, and newer software tends to fix older bugs.\n3) Hardware support.  Newer versions of the operating system are sometimes required to work with new devices, especially if you're running an '05 version and you now want to connect to a new TYPE of device (that may not have even been invented in '05).\n4) Features.  Newer software usually has more features, and can do more of what you want.\nReasons to not stay up-to-date:\n1) Bugs.  Yeah, newer features mean newer bugs, so this is a double-edged sword.\n2) Features.  Sometimes (i.e. Gnome 3) new features mean your software won't work the same way it used to, and that can be annoying.  Thinking about my mom here, and the fact that once she gets used to doing things a certain way, she usually doesn't want to change (at least not without a compelling reason).\nThe first four points apply to all programs and operating systems, but specifically as they relate to Ubuntu:\n1) All active O/S's provide security patches; I prefer Ubuntu, since as a subscriber to their security list, I have a pretty good handle on what I'm updating when the patches are suggested by the update-manager.\n2) All software has bugs; I prefer Ubuntu, since as a programmer I can poke around and submit a bug report or patch and have a better likelihood that there's a human on the other end that cares.  Anecdotal, to be sure, but I've done this a few times with open source programs; never felt it worth my time with commercial software.\n3) I punt on this one, and only used hardware that I know Ubuntu supports well.  It's not a bad tactic to use for Windows as well, as they have driver issues themselves.\n4) Given the typically free-as-in-beer nature of Ubuntu, upgrading to get new features has no sticker shock, making it a much nicer process than with other O/S's.  Just go and grab various programs and give them a spin.\nBottom line here, I think, is that the reasons you SHOULD stay up-to-date are the same for all programs and operating systems, but Ubuntu makes it better in various ways to ACTUALLY stay up-to-date.  (YMMV.)\n\nA: I make a few assumptions in my reply.\nRequirements of the individual will determine if an upgrade is warranted or not. A corporate using Ubuntu will be better off sticking to a Long Term Release (LTS) of Ubuntu for stability reasons and to minimize disruption and benefit from Ubuntu Support. I would not upgrade until the next LTS was available...\nAs a private individual it makes sense to upgrade with the Ubuntu release time-line for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware mostly drives Software development, the more powerful the hardware the more options become available to software developers, Ubuntu is no exception. While the kernel is not maintained by Ubuntu itself, newer versions of the kernel are released periodically, be it minor or major. The kernel is the interface between the hardware and the software. As an end user when you purchase, for example, a new webcam, or a new laptop you are most likely purchasing current hardware, you need the latest kernel to be able to run that hardware properly, Ubuntu is constantly providing kernel revisions and so keeping up with the latest releases increases the chances of your new hardware working with Ubuntu.\n\n*Web development is prolific, has been and will be for a good few years to come, we have witnessed the likes of Facebook and twitter being integrated into almost every piece of technology we use, again Ubuntu is no exception, it has evolved along with these social web technology's and integrated them more tightly into every new release. We have become reliant on these technologies and therefore by upgrading to the latest version of Ubuntu we ensure we have the tools to make best use of these technologies.\n\n*The more obvious among the bunch are security patches, bugs and so forth, but most of these are covered in the Ubuntu Updates for as long as the version of Ubuntu you are running is supported.\n\n*In the past few releases we have seen Ubuntu change it's desktop layout from the more common drop-down (Gnome), menu approach to using Unity. Upgrading along with every new release has slowly introduced Unity to the user, those who didn't necessarily like it could use the old drop-down approach but it was made clear that Unity would inevitably be the default in future releases. Users then have a chance to try, test, prod, Unity rather than jumping to a release where it was the only option. This logic applies for all features of the Ubuntu OS of course, Shotwell becoming the default image viewer is just another example.\nFinally, Microsoft evolves it's OS over a very long time and tries to reinvent it's OS which leaves the user hesitant to upgrade because of the huge differences and learning curve involved. If Microsoft approached their OS upgrades the same way Ubuntu, or more so Linux does, the user would feel more comfortable and be eased into the newer OS more comfortably, another reason why keeping up with the new releases of Ubuntu is a good idea.\nThese are my views and opinions, they are accurate to my knowledge & understanding and meant only to assist with the question and not rewrite the law :)\n", "Q: Script to login and load main gui in Ubuntu 11.10 I have a RFID reader interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller left over from a past project, which I would now like to use to automatically login on Ubuntu 11.10. What I'm imagining specifically is that I would start up my computer normally, it would get to the login screen for Ubuntu, I would swipe my RFID card and Ubuntu would then begin loading the desktop and everything as though I had typed in my password. \nI have a python script already made that can read the RFID tag and use it to decrypt my password, and I can set it up to run when the computer starts up. I just have no idea what scripts Ubuntu runs when a user logs in.\nBasically, all I need to know is what to add to my script so Ubuntu will load my profile and desktop as though I had just entered my password on the normal login screen. \n\nA: You would probably have to come up with something that hooks into PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module). For obvious reasons, authentication mechanisms are quite tricky to deal with. I suggest reading up on all things related to PAM and then hooking in to your welcome screen, which is likely lightdm unless you've changed it.\nAside from that your project is really cool (which it is!), I would cautiously recommend against securing your system solely with a physical object that someone can steal or borrow, since it would give them access to everything on your computer should they obtain it.\n", "Q: How to disable overlay scrollbar hiding behavior If I move mouse cursor on the scrollbar and don't move it then scrollbar just hides after few seconds.

I recommend running the command without -delete first to get a list of the files that will be removed when -delete is included in the command. This way a small typo won't delete anything you didn't intend to.\nFor more information on how to use find and what it can do see man find\nNote that find will not produce any output when -delete is used.\nRegarding the comment on multiple extensions\nfind . -type f \\( -name \\*jpg -o -name \\*png \\) -delete\n\n\n*\n\n*( .. ) Group expression.

Then go to System>Preferences>Adobe Flash Player>Advanced>Trusted Location Settings>Choose folder. \nFrom there  I went to home/usr/.mozilla and it worked like a charm!\nGood luck! \n", "Q: Adding directory to PATH, various ways and differences I have seen the thread\nHow to add a directory to the PATH?\nI already have added the directory in my PATH by directly editing the /etc/environment. However, I do not get the command working when I use it as\n$ sudo command --options\nHowever, things work great when I do\n # command   --options \nor\n$ command --options \nWhy is this the case? Also, this is not my full question. I would be thankful if someone could explain the various ways of adding directories to the path, how they work, and when is each of them in effect. How are they different?\nThe point of the question is not so much to get things working, but to understand how it all works. Pointing to a guide that explains this would be a great answer too.\n\nA: Add it to /root/.bashrc, /etc/profile, and /etc/bash.bashrc. It should work :)\nThe reason is that sudo uses the /root files, and not the system-wide files (or at least, in my experience).\n", "Q: Delete file from the /usr/sbin What is the goal of /usr/sbin folder?\nI found in that folder modem-manager, which makes me many problems. Can I delete it from that directory?\n\nA: /bin (and /sbin) were intended for programs that needed to be on a small / partition before the larger /usr, etc. partitions were mounted. These days, it mostly serves as a standard location for key programs like /bin/sh, although the original intent may still be relevant for e.g. installations on small embedded devices.\n/sbin, as distinct from /bin, is for system management programs (not normally used by ordinary users) needed before /usr is mounted.\n/usr/bin is for distribution-managed normal user programs.\n/usr/sbin with the same relationship to /usr/bin as /sbin has to /bin.\n/usr/local/bin is for normal user programs not managed by the distribution package manager, e.g. locally compiled packages. You should not install them into /usr/bin because future distribution upgrades may modify or delete them without warning.\n/usr/local/sbin, as you can probably guess at this point, is to /usr/local/bin as /usr/sbin to /usr/bin.\nIn addition, there is also /opt which is for monolithic non-distribution packages, although before they were properly integrated various distributions put Gnome and KDE there. Generally you should reserve it for large, poorly behaved third party packages such as Oracle.\nAs far as deleting modem-manager goes, deleting the folder will probably only give you more problems if certain external programs are calling for it and its not there.  I would find out what the underlying problem is for why it is giving you so many problems.\n\nA: You should never just delete system files, you will run into problems 100 %.\n`/usr/sbin/ usually contains files with the Â»setuidÂ« bit set â when executed they will run under their owning user instead of the user who executed them.\nTo remove modem-manager, find the package that contains that file and remove it using apt-get (hint: the package is named modemmanager, sudo apt-get remove modemmanager to remove it)\n", "Q: How to see terminal commands generated by GUI actions I am new to Linux and only know my way around because of the GUI.  Is there a way to see the equivalent commands on the terminal to do the same things as using the GUI?  Thanks \n\nA: Probably not, because a GUI most of the time isn't calling the same command as a user would type in the terminal.\nThat said, if you want to know more about terminal commands, these are some usefull sites which explain common commands:\nGeneral use\nSome common commands\nA more advanced list\n\nA: I know this is a few years late but was cited as an answer to a similar question (making both answers wrong). While this answer more correctly answers the other question, I couldn't find where to respond.\nYou can find out by using strace.  Run the GUI or command line software or command from the terminal preceded by strace e.g.\nstrace gedit\n\nor\nstrace ls\n\nQuoting from man strace:\n\nIn  the simplest case strace runs the specified command until it exits.  It intercepts and records the system calls which are called by a process and the signals which are received by a process.  The name of each system call,\n         its arguments and its return value are printed on standard error or to the file specified with the -o option.\nstrace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.  System administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving problems with programs for which  the  source  is  not  readily\n         available  since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.  Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that a great deal can be learned about a system and its system calls by tracing even ordinary programs.  And programmers will find that since system calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel interface, a close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug isolation, sanity checking and  attempting\n         to capture race conditions.\nEach line in the trace contains the system call name, followed by its arguments in parentheses and its return value.  An example from stracing the command cat /dev/null is:\n  open(\"/dev/null\", O_RDONLY) = 3\n\n\n", "Q: libcurl error when running Boinc I downloaded the latest versione of Boinc x64. When I run the manager, there is an error\n./boincmgr: error while loading shared libraries: libcurl.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: It seems that you need to install the Ubuntu package libcurl3 to provide the shared object file (=library) that the command complains about missing. Install it either through the Software Center or by writing sudo apt-get install libcurl3 in a terminal window (it will ask for your password to be able to install the program onto the system).\nIs there any particular reason that you have not installed the boinc package that comes with Ubuntu, by the way? If it were me, I would prefer to have updates coming in for a program that turns my computer into a work node that executes code that I can't really verify for myself. :-)\n\nA: https://launchpad.net/~xapienz/+archive/ubuntu/curl34\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xapienz/curl34\nsudo apt-get update\n", "Q: How can I see a folder's exact size in bytes?

You can see if your chosen id is in use by doing grep '10141' /etc/passwd. If that is the case then the error message is certainly a bit misleading :/\nIt's also quite possible that your system recognises users who are not in /etc/passwd - for example by using LDAP. One quick way to test that is to do id atc and see if the system recognises it. Another way would be getent passwd atc which will also show you users the system recognises who are not in /etc/passwd. Or you could again check if the uid is in use with getent passwd 10141. (You can also run getent passwd to get the full list of entries.) More about getent.\nTo see where these users might come from you could look at /etc/nsswitch.conf (man page) - the line starting passwd will show you where your system is looking for users. Common default values are files and compat, though more complex setups may have multiple values including values such as ldap, dns and winbind. files means the standard files including /etc/passwd. \nI'm not so clear on the exact meaning of compat, but my reading of the nsswitch.conf man page suggests it is a combination of files and nis. nis is the Network Information Service which is largely superceded these days but may affect your system.\n\nA: As one of the above answer suggested, take a look at your NSS library file /etc/nsswitch.conf to check if system search for a user in LDAP kind of setup. If so, you can do one of the following action to fix the problem:\n\n*\n\n*Remove the user from ldap server.\n\n\n*Remove the ldap reference from the /etc/nsswitch.conf file so that NSS library dont look for the user in ldap server.\n\n\n*Keep the user in the ldap as it is, but create the same user in the system using luseradd command.\nluseradd myuser\nTake a look at this article https://www.easyaslinux.com/quick-fix/user-already-exists-error-when-user-doesnt-exist-on-the-system/ for detailed steps.\n", "Q: Can T520+Bumblebee run an external monitor via DisplayPort? Using 64-bit Ubuntu 11.10 and integrated (Intel) graphics, I can run the 1600x900 laptop display plus a 1600x1200 external monitor connected to the VGA adapter.  But my external monitor is 1920x1200 so I have black stripes on each side.\nI believe the resolution is limited like this as the maximum resolution available from the Intel GPU is 2560x1600 = 4,096,000 pixels and I'm asking for a 3520x1200 = 4,224,000 display (with 1200x300 lost above the laptop screen). At 3200x1200 = 3,840,000 pixels, the Intel GPU seems happy.\nUnder Windows, the same limit exists when using the VGA adapter, but if I turn Optimus on then I can connect the external monitor to the DisplayPort and get its full resolution and an extended desktop.\nI've seen that Bumblebee can run apps on the DisplayPort using the 'optirun' command.  My question is: can Bumblebee run the DisplayPort in concert with the Intel card running the laptop screen creating a large virtual desktop (as on Windows)?\nIf so, are there any pointers to how to do this?  I tried once, failed, and dropped back to Integrated Graphics (and black stripes) as I could find no reports of this configuration working.\n\nA: I have a W520, but I think this information should hold also for the T520 (though there are some minor differences between the configurations of the two regarding the VGA port). As far as I can tell, the Display Port is connected directly to the Nvidia card. When in \"Optimus\" mode (set in the bios), the internal Thinkpad display is controlled by the integrated card. Since xrandr cannot handle multiple graphics cards controlling the same X session (as far as I can tell), you must use Xinerama if you want to stay in the \"Optimus\" bios mode (this is without bumblebee) to have a single desktop across all screens. This means creating a custom xorg.conf. Your other option is to switch to \"Discrete\" graphics mode in the bios so that the nvidia card is connected directly to both the Thinkpad display and the DisplayPort output. In this case you can use disper to easily connect and disconnect your external monitor on the fly (this is also without bumblebee).\nI have prepared a blog post here outlining the situation for the W520. It also contains an xorg.conf to get you started if you want to pursue the Optimus option. In summary, I think that if you want a desktop across all screens, you will have to eschew Bumblebee.\n", "Q: Mouse is choppy When I installed Ubuntu (11.10) a few days ago, my mouse cursor was smooth and responsive.

This is where the problem started. Using the Wallpaper menu, I could no longer select any images that have previously been used as wallpapers. What Gives? \n\nA: It's looking only in specific locations for the wallpapers.  In order to use your own, you will need to either locate the pictures you used, by pressing the \"+\" button below the thumbnails, and browsing for the picture.

I don't have authority to restart services or reboot the machine.\n\nA: To try to kill all processes owned by a user username, run:\npkill -U username\n\n\nA: With this application you can view program listings\ninstall htop\nsudo apt-get install htop\n\nfor see process and kill process \nYou can install it and simply delete\n\n\nA: You can use\nps -ax | grep application name \n\nIf your searching for firefox type in terminal like ps -ax | grep firefox, it shows the process id of corresponding application. You can stop that application by kill command if process id=1317, \nkill -9 1317\n\n\nA: I wrote a little script I wrote to kill (in my case) Skype:\nkill -s 9 `ps aux | grep skype | head -n 1 | cut -f4 -d\" \"`\n\nBut I found that as much as that worked then, it didn't work the next day because the pid was a different length and there for the amount of spaces was different\nThen I came across this site and tried\npgrep -l -u justin\n\nwhich conveniently outputs processes in the format\n[pid] [name]\n\nSo I adjusted my code in the script to this:\nkill -s 9 `pgrep -l -u justin | grep skype | cut -f1 -d\" \"`\n\nWhat this does is pipes all of the processes justin is running (that can be changed to any user name) to grep which looks for skype (this can be changed to your process) and then pipes that line to cut which then reads only the PID and finally uses that PID in the kill command to kill it.\n\nA: Let's try something more:  \nsudo apt-get install htop \n\nThe top command is the traditional way to view your systemâs resource usage and see the processes that are taking up the most system resources. Top displays a list of processes, with the ones using the most CPU at the top.\nhtop displays the same information with an easier-to-understand layout. It also lets you select processes with the arrow keys and perform actions, such as killing them or changing their priority, with the F keys.\n\nA: To kill all the processes that you have the permission to kill, simply run the command\nkill -15 -1 or kill -9 -1 depending on the desired behavior (use man kill for details)\nTo kill a specific process, say, firefox, simply run\npkill firefox or killall firefox depending on the behavior you want: What's the difference between 'killall' and 'pkill'?\nIf you want to see what processes are running use the command\nps -ef\n\nIf you want to look up all processes by user bob, this might help\npgrep -l -u bob\n\nor\nps -ef | grep bob\n\n\nA: ...All processes in Linux respond to signals. Signals are an os-level way of telling programs to terminate or modify their behavior.\nHow To Send Processes Signals by PID\nThe most common way of passing signals to a program is with the kill command.\nAs you might expect, the default functionality of this utility is to attempt to kill a process:\nkill PID_of_target_process\n\nThis sends the TERM signal to the process. The TERM signal tells the process to please terminate. This allows the program to perform clean-up operations and exit smoothly.\nIf the program is misbehaving and does not exit when given the TERM signal, we can escalate the signal by passing the KILL signal:\nkill -KILL PID_of_target_process\n\nThis is a special signal that is not sent to the program.\nInstead, it is given to the operating system kernel, which shuts down the process. This is used to bypass programs that ignore the signals sent to them...\n\nA: I would use xkill. Enter xkill in a terminal and click in the window, or enter xkill and the process ID and it will be terminated. \nFound out more about xkill on x.org. \n\nA: I'd break your problem into 2 parts:\n1) How do I find the processes started by me? Run this: \nps -u `whoami`\n\nThe whoami is just in case you don't know the name of the account you are using, otherwise just type the name of the account without the back quotes.\nThis will list all processes that can be deleted by your account.\n2) The ps command will list the process number, the TTY, Time, and CMD. The process ID is the first column. Use that number to kill the process. Be careful while killing the process. You might break something if you kill the wrong process.\nTo kill a process you will use the kill command, which sends a SIGNAL to the process. The signal indicates what the process should do. For example, sending a -1 to the process will ask it to reload the configuration file; sending a -2 is equivalent to pressing the Control+C on that process; -9 will cause the kernel to abandon the process, without communicating it to the process. \nSupposing that  ps -u whoami returned something like \n  PID TTY          TIME CMD\n 4333 pts/1    00:00:00 fish\n 4335 ?        00:00:00 fishd\n 4816 ?        00:00:00 intellij\n 4868 ?        00:50:42 java\n 4939 ?        00:00:19 fsnotifier64\n 7667 ?        02:49:08 firefox\n 7698 ?        00:00:00 unity-webapps-s\n\nAnd you wanted to kill the firefox process by its process id, then you'd do:\nkill -1 7667\n\nThen you'd re-run the same ps command and check if the process was still running. If it is still running, then do a \nkill -2 7667\n\nworking your way up to -9.\nTo kill all processes started by your account, enter kill <level> -1. Same as before: work your way up to -9.\nIf you know the name of the process you can simply go killall <processname>, where the  is what you are trying to kill. For example: killall fish (fish, in this sense, is the Friendly Interactive SHell).\nDocumentation for killall can be found here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/killall.1.html\n\nA: Use sudo kill <pid> or sudo killall <process-name>\n\nA: I used following procedure to kill a process in Ubuntu ::\nStep 1 : Get the pid of the process by using grep or you can use -C also ::\nps aux | -C 'filename'\n\nor \nps -ef | -C 'filename'\n\nor \nps aux | grep 'filename'\n\nor\nps -ef | grep 'filename' \n\nStep 2 : Note the pid number .\nStep 3 : Use 'kill' command alongwith the pid number as :\nkill pidnumber\n\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+Delete can be set to give you access to the task manager, from where it's easy to kill processes with a couple clicks, and for me, less requirement for remembering commands that could be damaging if done wrong:\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/07/use-ctrl-alt-del-task-manager-ubuntu/\nhttps://www.itsmarttricks.com/a-guide-to-kill-pkill-and-killall-commands-to-stop-the-process-in-linux-kill-process-linux/\n", "Q: How to see how long a device has been on (For devices that support this) What tools does Ubuntu have that can say how long a device has been on. The time on should not be based on when Ubuntu was installed since for example the PC could be 2 years old and after that long somebody could have installed Ubuntu. This 2 years could not be taken into consideration. Not to confuse with uptime for example.\nIs there a way to determine the time a device has been on or active and what tools can see this. For example I know hard drives can say this. What other devices could and what tools for this devices.\n\nA: As you mention, hard drives support this through SMART and you can view that data through Disk Utility:\n\nBut past disks, I'm not sure I've ever seen this on other hardware.\n", "Q: How I can set default cursors theme for current user I don't want to edit\n/usr/share/icons/default/index.theme\n\nor change alternatives\nupdate-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme\n\nbecause different users use different cursors theme. So I need to specify it for current users. I try to use following locations\n~/.icons/default\n~/.local/share/icons/default\n\nbut without success.\n\nA: I believe this question was partially answered, since the answer only specifies how to install a theme.\nYes, to install additional mouse cursor (x11) themes for the current user, the theme must be placed in the \"~/.icons\" directory.\nNow to set it, \"gnome-tweak-tool\" should be installed.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nAfter having installed gnome-tweak-tool, open it and navigate to Theme, and choose your Cursor theme from there. Please note, setting your cursor theme through there will only change it for certain applications.\nNow comes the tricky part, setting the theme without modifying the /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme file. \nIn your ~/.icons directory, create a directory named \"default\". Then, inside that directory, create an \"index.theme\" file. Open it with your preferable text editor, and add the following settings to it:\n[Icon Theme]\nInherits=<cursor theme name>\n\nThen log out, and log in again, you should see your new cursor theme appear just for that user account. I believe this is what's going on. When loading a cursor theme, the system would first check for a ~/.icons/default/index.theme file, and if it cannot find it, then it will use the system's version (/usr/share/icons/default/index.theme).\n\nA: @WarriorIng64 You can install additional mouse themes from the Ubuntu Software Center. Additionally, you can manually install new themes such as those from gnome-look.org by extracting the theme folders into /usr/share/icons/ or ~/.icons.

I am running 11.10.\nTo fix this I did the following:\nsudo apt-get update\nfrom the console.\n", "Q: How to get the hostname from a DHCP server I want Ubuntu to get the hostname and DNS name from a DHCP client. The default installation of UbuntuÂ 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) does not do that.\nThe same question was asked and is unsolved on Ubuntu Forums.\n\nA: Oli's answer is demonstrably false (\"You don't get your hostname from the DHCP server\"), as evidenced by the other answers here, and also by my recent experience on a RHEL7 system.  Said system got its host name from the DHCP server.\nAnd, indeed, there are things in the DHCP configuration files that are supposed to make it happen.  For example:\nhost host4 {   # verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n  hardware ethernet  41:88:22:11:33:22;\n  fixed-address 192.168.0.4;                                                                                                                                                                                 \n  option host-name \"host4\";\n}\n\nIs supposed to tell that host that his name is host4.\nAs it turns out, isc's dhclient DOES NOT APPEAR TO SUPPORT THIS!\nHowever, dhcpcd5 does, out of the box.  Stop dhclient, install dhcpcd5, run dhcpcd, renew your lease, and poof, your hostname on your DHCP client is set to the name sent from the DHCP server.  No dhclient-exit-hooks.d scripting, no hacks in rc.local, nothing.\nAs an end-note, I've spent a lot of time trying to get this to work using ISC's dhclient.  Absolutely no joy, even when the server sends the host name.\nMy initial solution to the problem was writing some cute code in rc.local to detect when the network came up and forcing a (in my case) search of /etc/hosts to get the hostname and then running hostname with that host name.  It works, but until the network comes up your hostname is probably wrong (when first deploying a host, I remove /etc/hostname, so the host name is localhost until I can run /etc/init.d/hostname.sh start once the network comes up - so when first getting a new name you need to boot twice - once to get your hostname, and once to have that name available when everything starts up...).\n\nA: There is a way to do it with a little script for a dhcp hook as described here.\nCreate a new file:\nsudoedit /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/hostname\n\nand paste the following code:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Filename:     /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/hostname\n# Purpose:      Used by dhclient-script to set the hostname of the system\n#               to match the DNS information for the host as provided by\n#               DHCP.\n#\n\n\n# Do not update hostname for virtual machine IP assignments\nif [ \"$interface\" != \"eth0\" ] && [ \"$interface\" != \"wlan0\" ]\nthen\n    return\nfi\n\n\nif [ \"$reason\" != BOUND ] && [ \"$reason\" != RENEW ] \\\n   && [ \"$reason\" != REBIND ] && [ \"$reason\" != REBOOT ]\nthen\n        return\nfi\n\necho dhclient-exit-hooks.d/hostname: Dynamic IP address = $new_ip_address\nhostname=$(host $new_ip_address | cut -d ' ' -f 5 | sed -r 's/((.*)[^\\.])\\.?/\\1/g' )\necho $hostname > /etc/hostname\nhostname $hostname\necho dhclient-exit-hooks.d/hostname: Dynamic Hostname = $hostname\n\nReplace eth0 and wlan0 with the names of the interfaces from which you want to obtain the hostname. In most cases eth0 and wlan0 should stay the same.\nMake sure it is readable...\nchmod a+r /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/hostname\n\nThat's all. On the next dhcp response your hostname will update automatically.\n\nA: Note that when using Ubuntu 18.04 the tie-in scripts are no longer necessary.  If the hostname of the install is set to localhost in /etc/hostname the DHCP client will set the hostname automatically at startup using the name issued by DHCP, if present.  When running hostnamectl it will list localhost as the permanent hostname, and whatever DHCP issues as a transient hostname.\ntestaccount@dhcp-hostname:~$ hostnamectl\n   Static hostname: localhost\nTransient hostname: dhcp-hostname\n\n\nA: You can get your hostname from your DHCP server - it is part of the DHCP specification.\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1533#section-3.14\n\"This option specifies the name of the client\"\n\nA: d_inevitable's answer almost solved my problem, but not completely. The problem was that although: \n\n\n*\n\n*The DHCP server was sending a hostname (by adding the \noption host name 'client1' \n\nin the dhcpd.conf) and I actually verified it by capturing and analyzing the contents of the DHCP offer with wireshark\n\n*The DHCP client was expecting the hostname from DHCP server (by adding \nrequest host-name \n\nin the dhclient.conf)\nThe client was not getting a new hostname (easily verified by typing\nhostname\n\nin terminal and getting the old hostname, or no hostname if I had deleted the contents/file). As a result, the proposed solution by d_inevitable was only copying an empty string.\nTo solve that, I applied a crud solution, that generally should not be followed unless you are desperate to make it work, like I was.\nFirst, open with edit capability the DHCP client control script:\nsudo vi /sbin/dhclient-script\n\nThere, you will have to locate the function \nset_hostname()\n\nJust use the search and it should come right up. Now, at least on my computer, this function has three if-then-else conditions, encapsulated to each other:\n\n# set host name set_hostname() {\n      local current_hostname\nif [ -n \"$new_host_name\" ]; then\n    current_hostname=$(hostname)\n\n    # current host name is empty, '(none)' or 'localhost' or differs from new one from DHCP\n    if [ -z \"$current_hostname\" ] ||\n       [ \"$current_hostname\" = '(none)' ] ||\n       [ \"$current_hostname\" = 'localhost' ] ||\n       [ \"$current_hostname\" = \"$old_host_name\" ]; then\n       if [ \"$new_host_name\" != \"$old_host_name\" ]; then\n           hostname \"$new_host_name\"\n       fi\n    fi\nfi }\n\n\nNow, what you need is to force the assignment of the new hostname to your host, no matter what. Therefore you want to comment out the two encapsulated if-then-else. The result should look something like:\n\n# set host name set_hostname() {\n      local current_hostname\nif [ -n \"$new_host_name\" ]; then\n    current_hostname=$(hostname)\n\n    # current host name is empty, '(none)' or 'localhost' or differs from new one from DHCP\n    #if [ -z \"$current_hostname\" ] ||\n    #   [ \"$current_hostname\" = '(none)' ] ||\n    #   [ \"$current_hostname\" = 'localhost' ] ||\n    #   [ \"$current_hostname\" = \"$old_host_name\" ]; then\n    #   if [ \"$new_host_name\" != \"$old_host_name\" ]; then\n           hostname \"$new_host_name\"\n    #   fi\n    #fi\nfi }\n\n\nNow the d_inevitable's or this should work as expected. Hope that helps if you are in a similar desperate frustration as I was.\n\nA: You don't get your hostname from the DHCP server.\nYou can send your hostname to the server, which may change the IP you're assigned. You can change what name is sent either by editing your Network Manager connection (the field is called DHCP Client ID) or you can edit (as root) /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf. Look for the line that says:\nsend host-name \"<hostname>\";\n\n... and change <hostname> to whatever you like.\n\nBy default Ubuntu will get its DNS settings from the router (if it sends them) but I suspect you're talking about local DNS/mDNS where you can access other computers by their hostname. This is called Ahavi or Zeroconf in Ubuntu and it's installed by default.\nYou should be able to access your computer by <hostname>.local\n\nA: The answer depends on whether or not you are using static leases on your DHCP server. If you are, it is unnecessary to get the hostname from DNS. You can change this line in d_inevitable's solution\nhostname=$(host $new_ip_address | cut -d ' ' -f 5)\n\nto\nhostname=${new_host_name}\n\nBut this should happen automatically if your hostname is originally set to localhost.localdomain, so you don't have to write a script. However, if you want to set the hostname to the FQDN, you'll need to change d_inevitable's script to \nhostname=${new_host_name}.${new_domain_name}\n\nAgain, all this only works if you're using static leases.\n\nA: If found that can be a dhcpclient scripts bug. http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2013/11/setting-hostname-from-dhcp-in-debian.html\nTry to clean $old_host_name on ip renew\n\necho unset old_host_name > /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/unset_old_hostname\n\nAlso static /etc/hostname seems to has prority over dhcp answer so leave it empty\n\n> /etc/hostname\n\nTested on ubuntu 14.04 and dnsmasq server.\n\nA: Don't have enough reputation to comment, but I'd like to piggy-back on the previous answer as it almost solved the problem for me using a dhclient hook.\nI've found that using the standard ISC DHCP Server for some reason, the aforementioned hook outputs a host name with a '.' period character at the end of the hostname for some reason.\nSo, in the previous answer you might need \"cut out\" the extraneous period with a sed:\nhostname=$(host $new_ip_address | cut -d ' ' -f 5)\n\nWould become:\nhostname=$(host $new_ip_address | cut -d ' ' -f 5 | sed -e \"s/\\.$//g\")\n\n\nA: First get an IP address for your client from your DHCP server, then you'll find the client hostname in /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases looks for the client-hostname entries. HTH\n", "Q: Installing software that is unavailable in standard repositories [decision tree] What are the general steps I want to take to get a program installed on Ubuntu when the program has not been made into a package, or I need an updated software version from what would normally be installed and that version is available in a later repository?\nI'll give you my specific example. I'm currently using 10.04LTS and I don't want to upgrade. I want to install the expect-lite package, but it's only available for Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/expect-lite\nThe decision tree I think I want to implement is the following (I think I'm currently at step #3):\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install #if available (or by using the GUI package manager)\n\n*Enable universe and multiverse if not already and repeat step 1.\n\n*Install a package from a later version of Ubuntu. (How? What pitfalls do I need to watch for?)\n\n*install a package from an unstable version of Debian. (same questions from above)\n\n*Find and Install a package from Ubuntu's PPA (personal package archive), realising that packages are not reviewed for malicious  backdoors or trojans, and this risk could be unacceptable to many people)\n\n*If one has the ability, create a personal package from source, and install that (and upload it to the PPA archive if possible to make it available to others)\n\n*Install directly from source, and make a dummy package to deal with any dependency issues (knowing full well that this could cause issues if a distro upgrade was attempted later) (info: http://eric.lubow.org/2010/system-administration/creating-dummy-packages-on-debian/ )\n\n*Install directly from source as a last ditch effort. \nEdited to add:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Use  the package Alien to convert a .rpm package to a .deb and then install (see this)\n\n*(from BlueXrider's answer below) See if you can find the package in a non-standard repository or download a .deb file from a trusted source and use that.\n\nA: As the author of expect-lite, you can always download the latest version at http://expect-lite.sf.net/: on that site you will find a Debian package, which you can then install using:\nsudo dpkg -i  expect-lite_4.5.0-0ubuntu1_all.deb\n\nIf you are uncomfortable installing as root, you can install the .tar.gz version by untaring and running the installer as a non-privileged user using:\n./install.sh -p <my install location>\n\nAll of expect-lite is open source, so feel free to view the source of the installer or expect-lite itself. There are no compiled binaries in the package.\n\nA: My decision tree is:\n--1. Can I get?\n--2. Will it work?\nExpect Lite\nGDebi says yes lets install it. Sourceforge I feel is a trusted source.\nIf I can't configure it there is always a tweak/hack available.\nUltimately it's up to you.\n", "Q: Running Programs As Root While Online I'm remastering an Ubuntu based distro, meant to be used live only and primarily as a browser so a users hard-drive can be virus free while online.  This live browsing adds security for Linux users, but seconds as a Guardian for Windows and Mac users hardrive.  It is a nice invitation for their users to take a look at what the Linux OS has to offer to help protect their chosen OS's.  I'm adding an easy grandma tutorial so they can remaster it with all their browser and user space customizations.\nMost users will want a password manager to help them sign into their accounts.  I'm using Firefox, but the Firefox password manager once opened with the master password will give any requesting service that knows how to make a request unhindered access to all encrypted passwords.  Due to this, I've decided to go with a stand alone password manager which will give some permission flexibilities to help deal with those issues.  Keepassx has been the main choice.\nThere is a similar problem, in that, malicious code could access the Keepassx data base because both malicious code and Keepassx would share the same privileges in the online users space.\nIn order to add more security, I'm considering changing Keypassx permisions so the Keepassx data base is not accessible to the online user, unless the user enters their admin password.  This logically would result in making it harder for an attacker to access.  Although, I'm new to setting up security environments.  Therefore my question...\nIs it a good idea and safe to force Keepassx only to be launched as root user on Ubuntu, taking in mind the user will be online with Firefox?\n\nA: I might be wrong on this but it is my understanding that if you give a utility root privileges and it gets compromised by malicious code, then the malicious code also gets root privileges.\nIt is my understanding that for this reason Ubuntu handles security differently from other distributions. It does not install a root user. It installs a user that gets root privileges when that user, as administrator, needs root privileges. Once the task is finished or the time limit has been reached the user with administrator access loses the root privileges. This reduces the risk of malicious code getting root access.\nThis is why in Ubuntu we do not use \"su\" but \"sudo\" before a command in the terminal. We limit the opportunity for malicious code to get access and do damage by restricting our use of root privileges.\nThis is the document that I get my understanding from:\nUbuntu reasons for sudo and not su or root\nI strongly advise you to consider the reasons that the Ubuntu developers have for doing things this way. It is those reasons that cause me to say that what you intend to do is not safe.\nI quote the official document:\n\nBy default, the Root account password is locked in Ubuntu. This means\n  that you cannot login as Root directly or use the su command to become\n  the Root user. However, since the Root account physically exists it is\n  still possible to run programs with root-level privileges. This is\n  where sudo comes in - it allows authorized users (normally\n  \"Administrative\" users; for further information please refer to\n  AddUsersHowto) to run certain programs as Root without having to know\n  the root password.\n\n\nA: Well, there are two separate aspects in running an application as root; one of them improves security and another one may compromise it - I think mixing those two aspects explains your confusion.\n\n\n*\n\n*running an application as another user (possibly root user, but not necessary) makes it more difficult for another process to access files owned/created by that application and do other nasty things (send a KILL signal, for example). This is good.\n\n*if an application happen to have a vulnerability (i.e. sending it some specially formatted input makes it to execute some code via buffer overflow etc.) - then, after exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker will be able to execute code with the privileges of that process. In this sense, running an application with root privileges is BAD, because it would give the highest level of privileges to attacker.\nNow you understand that running update manager as root may be bad if it contained a bug which would allow a specially-crafted .deb file to crash it and make it to execute some code. However, running some applications, such as package manager, with superuser privileges is unavoidable because they modify the essential parts of the system.\nThe common solution to this problem is to perform so-called \"privileges drop\" on program startup; this is often used to run webservers and other potentially exploitable (and accessible from outside) software. The idea is simple: the program starts as root, but as soon as possible it switches to some user account with as little privileges as possible (no shell login, chroot-ed to its home directory etc.) This way, even if compromised, it would give attacker a very limited access to the system. Also, other user accounts (except the superuser) will have no access to the application's files\nI'm not sure how easy would it be to run a desktop application like this though.\nActually, in this situation I think running web browser as a non-privileged user would make more sense. And, of course, Google gives us a few links on the subject:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running Firefox as another user, using sudo\n\n*How to Set Up and Run Firefox 3.0b2 as a Different User in Ubuntu\nTaking this idea to the extreme (as you're suggesing in the comments) will give you a system which is similar to how Android works; on Android each application operates within its own user account, so it only have access to its own files. This probably have some problematic areas in Ubuntu, i.e. if you downloaded a file using Firefox running in a restricted account, it'll only be able to save it in its own home folder so it won't be possible to open the file in a text processor (which runs as another user)...\nRegarding the launcher script I would imagine the script will be starting as root and invoking the applications as their respective users. The script will obviously need to be writeable by root only. Read about setuid.\n\nA: No, it's not a good idea.  It may break, and it may allow escalation to root.\nKeeping the password database safe from accidental or malicious exposure by other processes running as the same user is not trivial but it is worth trying.  But, that is much better done upstream in the Keypassx project, and by means other than running it as root.\n", "Q: No Grub Menu at start up after installing Ubuntu 11.10 I had Dual boot with windows xp and Ubuntu 10.4 on my PC. I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 on the Ubuntu 10.4. After restart it is directly entering into Ubuntu 11.10. There is no menu at start up for selecting Operating system.\n\nA: Open up a terminal window.  Then type:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nYou'll have to type in your password.  This will open up the grub configuration file.  Look at the first several lines.    You should see something like:\n# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update\n# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n# For full documentation of the options in this file, see:\n#   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=1\n\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 will hide the menu, but as you can see, it is commented out in mine (by prepending with #), so I do see the menu on boot.  If is it not commented out, do so.\nAlso, note that GRUB_TIMEOUT=1 sets the time until the grub menu automatically chooses the first option.  I've set it to 1; setting it to 0 would effectively hide it also.  So if it is 0, change it to a nonzero value.\nFinally, after making the necessary change, save and exit the editor.  At the terminal, as suggested in the grub config file, type \nsudo update-grub \n\nto make the changes stick. \n", "Q: Should I keep an experimental Kubuntu PPA? On a recent clean Kubuntu 11.10 64 bit install, Muon Package Manager and Muon Software Update Center would not work. I would just get a bug report.\nI had to do all the updates through Konsole. The only way I could get Muon to work was install an experimental version of Muon through a PPA, ppa:echidnaman/qapt-experimental.\nI am not having problems with the experimental version, it seems to work great.\nI am not a fan of experimental software and I know the cons of having an experimental PPA, like breaking the program on an update, but should I keep the experimental PPA or disable it and count on stable updates?\nIf I disable the experimental PPA will that cause problems of reverting to the release I am having problems with?\n\nA: There is nothing to say you can't keep the experimental ppa. Personally I would, here's why.\nIf the current (stable) Muon is not working and you have a bug report then something is breaking the stable version. This needs to be dealt with and will. As soon as the bug is fixed and you feel more comfortable then revert back to it.\nIn the mean time there is always a way to get updates. \n", "Q: Can I disable the splash screen and output verbose information when I shutdown?

Can anyone give a hand to me? any help appreciated!\n\nA: Have you tried just hitting escape when you shutdown? Perhaps even hitting it twice in some cases. Some distros use F2 or alt+F2 as well.\nIf that does nothing, either the key binding is different or that method will not work. Temporarily you can change the plymouths splash to off by restarting and hitting e to edit the grub command line, and then e again on the correct line, most likely the second line.\nHere you would scroll all the way to the end with your right arrow key and remove all of these if they exist: silent splash quiet splash=silent and any variation of them. Editing from the grub command line this way is safest because it will reset itself after each reboot. To continue booting from here you would hit enter and then b, or enter or ctrl enter.\nAnother option is to shutdown manually fron terminal using one of the following:\na) to restart:\nsudo shutdown -v -r now\n\nb) to shutdown:\nsudo shutdown -v -h now\n\nc) to shutdown but stop the shutdown process allowing you to read the verbose output:\nsudo shutdown -v now\n\n\nA: You can turn off the plymouth-splash using the following command:\nsudo mv /etc/init/plymouth-splash.conf /etc/init/plymouth-splash.conf.disabled\n\ncheck it out, have fun!\n", "Q: Is Apt-get Update Lag Related to Google Chrome? I have Google Chrome installed from the Google Chrome repository. When I run sudo apt-get update, I notice that getting headers relating to Google Chrome takes more time than is needed to get all the other headers. \nI thought it was normal but today I came across an (old) bug page that initially suggested use of sudo apt-get -o Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth=0 update instead of the basic sudo apt-get update and later stated that the problem was fixed (by April 2010). However, I feel I'm currently having the same problem: the process rapidly completes  ~97% in under 5 sec but the remaining ~3%, involving the Google Chrome headers, takes a couple of minutes or so more. Using sudo apt-get -o Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth=0 update doesn't significantly improve things.\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.10, fully updated.\nEdit on 20120502\nJust an observation: I updated to 18.0.1025.168 (Official Build 134367) and left the ppa ticked but it doesn't seem to be a problem now.

So I think it's a problem of Google's PPA server.\nFinally I moved to Chromium chromium-browser, I suggest you to evaluate it as an alternative.

My pac file have no username or password.\nPlease suggest me .How should the apt-get work in my new ubuntu 11.10.I am really struggling a lot to fix this issue\n\nA: I do not know if APT is able to use a PAC file directly but you can (with quite a bit of work/understanding) extract the relevant proxy information from the PAC file itself and use this information to configure APT to use a HTTP proxy.\nThe PAC file essentially consists of a JavaScript function. The return statement (one or more) of the function returns the proxy server address and port, for example:\nreturn \"PROXY proxy.some.site:8080; DIRECT\";\n\nJust look at your PAC file by entering its address in a browser. With this information you can create an APT configuration file:\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy\n\nYou should modify the file so that it contains the following information:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://proxy.some.site:8080\";\n\nSave the file and the next apt-get run should use the configured proxy setting. \nIt would be nice if APT could work with PAC files because we also use them in our company.

All of my 750 GB HDD partitions were in NTFS format. Yesterday I made 15 GB of unallocated space to install Ubuntu 11.10 x64. During the installation (installed from USB) I chose \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" option. After that everything goes smooth and installation was successfully completed. Ubuntu asked me to remove the installation media and restart the computer.\nAfter restarting the PC, Windows 7 was loaded. I was expecting an OS selection menu. It appears that Ubuntu didn't change master boot record at all.\nUsing EASEUS Partition Master Home Edition, I found that Ubuntu made 2 partitions in that 15 GB unallocated spaces (11 GB + 4 GB).

I don't want to use Boot Repair as it isn't officially supported by Canonical.\n\nA: This question has come up in past threads on this site.  Below is a link to help resolve your problem.  It requires booting from an Ubuntu live cd to be able to re-install GRUB in the master boot record.  Process is explained in detail\nRecovering GRUB after installing Windows 7?\n\nA: One nuance to be careful about - the instructions say to check if you have a separate boot partition, and if so then do  sudo mount /dev/sdÂ·Â· /mnt/boot. I got confused here - I did have a boot partition that was not my Linux, it was my base partition (/sda0). So I did that command, and ended up getting a grub menu that only showed my Windows boot. I re-ran the procedure without the doing the sudo mount /dev/sdÂ·Â· /mnt/boot and it worked beautifully.

Please help me..\n\nA: Hmm... instead of explaining how to change permissions on the root folder I'll just say \"you should not copy business-purpose files anywhere outside your home folder\"\nYour home folder is for your files.

Changing permissions of those folders is not considered a good practice.\nHaving said that, if you still want to copy files, you can do this by starting file manager in superuser mode by pressing Alt-F2 and typing gksu nautilus.\nIt'll ask you for your administrative password, after which you'll be able to copy files.\n\nA: You should not, IMO, be changing ownership or permissions on system file, including /root.\nIf you need to copy files to /root use sudo or gksu\nsudo cp file /root\n\ngksu nautilus\n\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\n\nA: In order to change anything that require root permissions \"Superuser\" you must have root access capabilities.  This must be done by providing the root password in order to change the files.  You can either do this in a few different ways.  Examples:\nsudo -s\n\nAfter typing the following command it will prompt your for the root password in which you will provide and hit enter.  If it is accepted then you will have full capabilities to do whatever you want on the system.\nAnother way is to use sudo before every command that requires root permissions.  Example:\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/passwd\n\nIn which this case /etc/passwd is a file that is read only to all users besides root and requires root permissions in order to change.

Also see this Unix & Linux question for the difference between Alt+Tab and Super+Tab.\nOn recent Ubuntu versions, you can press Alt+Tab and then F4 or W while holding down Alt on the selected window to close it.\nYou can also do the same from the Super+Tab view, but you must first enter the windows subgroup with ` and select the window you wish to close. Then press F4 or W while holding down Super on the selected window to close it.\n", "Q: How can I force DÃ©jÃ -Dup to backup only changed and new files? Every day DÃ©jÃ  Dup backups it needs a long time because of my Pictures-folder.

So far I could not find a function in this version by which I could do that. Thanks a lot for a helpful advice. \n\nA: The only operating system I know that has an uninstall feature, is Ubuntu when installed in a virtual filesystem inside Windows. If that is the case, then you can uninstall it from Windows' add/remove pane in the control panel. \nThere's normally no reason to uninstall an operating system. You can't use your computer without an operating system anyway, and all operating system installers are able to replace the one currently installed. If you want to delete everything on the harddisk, then you can simply format it. You can do that from an Ubuntu live CD/USB stick for instance. \nIf you want to replace 8.10 with a modern version of Ubuntu â and you really should â then it will be able to keep your data while replacing the operating system. It's quite easy.  \n", "Q: Turn off automatic file extension when renaming files? In Nautilus I tried to rename a .desktop file, but Unity (or is it Gnome? I suspect it's Unity but please correct me if I'm wrong) then renamed the file to end with .desktop.desktop - not what I wanted. After a bit of messing around I guessed that Unity was automatically adding a file extension and managed to rename it so it ended with only one .desktop\nHow can I turn off automatic file extension renaming? Or is this the only filetype which has this annoying behaviour? In which case I can live with it. Â (But I'll be tutting a lot. Â  ;-) \nI'm used to renaming files, so unexpected behaviour in both Nautilus and Thunar is annoying and gets in the way of my completing simple tasks. Thunar is even worse - it doesn't show the file extension at all!\n\nA: You are right, this is only with .desktop files. This was introduced a couple of releases ago to my knowledge, probably to make sure you don't break a starter/launcher.\n\nA: Using the mv command via the command line does not have this issue, if you do need to rename the file.\n", "Q: How to change desktop font color in xfce when using nautilus to show desktop I'm trying to change the desktop font color in xubuntu after I replaced thunar with nautilus to be the default file manager.

I/O error, dev sda, sector 545868115 Since a few days ago, my computer freezes whenever I sync my HDD with an external USB3 drive. When the keyboard gets temporarily a bit responsive I am able to switch to another terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F2) and I see the following image repeating continuously. I am on Ubuntu 11 using LuckyBackup.\nWhat is going on? Is my hdd defective? Is it the external one? Something else?\nMany thanks!\n\n\nA: You need to check and see if your disks are indeed failing. There are command line tools for monitoring SMART data (which is data that the hd reports about it's own health).\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools gsmartcontrol\n\nGsmartcontrol is a gui version of the same tool, and is very easy to use. Select the disk and run a short or long test in addition to viewing any errors the hd is reporting.\nTo run via the the command line, do the following\nsudo smartctl -i /dev/sda \n\nMake sure SMART is turned on. If not,\nsudo smartctl -s on /dev/sda \n\nFinally, run\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda \n\nor if it's a serial ata drive.\nsudo smartctl -a -d ata /dev/sda\n\nSee this link for more info about smartmontools.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/smartmontools/wiki/TocDoc\n\nA: Your HDD definitely looks like its reaching (EOL), End of Life. To elaborate on Javier's comment, I would suggest using an Ubuntu Live CD as opposed to the Disk Utility within your current Ubuntu instance, (for the obvious reason that when you plug in your external HDD the OS becomes unusable), and run the following command from the command line to check for disk errors:\ne2fsck -f -c -v /dev/sdX\n\nWhere sdX is the mount point of your external HDD. The external HDD should be plugged in but not mounted, you can unmount the disk using the Disk Utility, and as Javier pointed out you can also use the Disk Utility to check the SMART status of the HDD if it is SMART capable/ enabled.\nAgain, do all of this from within the Ubuntu LiveCD. While you are at it, check for errors/ health of your primary HDD.\n", "Q: Eclipse Menu Disappeared (another one) I encountered the (most likely) same strange behaviour as another user, but I'm quite certain, it has something to do with an update to Ubuntu itself within the last week or two.\nWhat have I done? - Used Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) within 11.10 for month, the menu showed up - as predicted - as a seperate menu, not a global one - My own RCP application is successfully showing a global menu.\nAn update occured... - The menu vanished.

Any explanation? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I had the same issue, here is what my exim4 paniclog looked like:\n$ sudo cat /var/log/exim4/paniclog\n\n2014-02-01 21:36:51 socket bind() to port 25 for address 127.0.0.1 failed: Address already in use: daemon abandoned\n2014-02-01 22:03:33 socket bind() to port 25 for address 127.0.0.1 failed: Address already in use: daemon abandoned\n2014-02-01 22:33:19 socket bind() to port 25 for address 127.0.0.1 failed: Address already in use: daemon abandoned\n2014-02-01 22:36:33 socket bind() to port 25 for address 127.0.0.1 failed: Address already in use: daemon abandoned\n2014-02-01 23:03:51 socket bind() to port 25 for address 127.0.0.1 failed: Address already in use: daemon abandoned\n2014-02-01 23:14:31 socket bind() to port 25 for address 127.0.0.1 failed: Address already in use: daemon abandoned\n2014-02-02 11:09:48 socket bind() to port 25 for address 127.0.0.1 failed: Address already in use: daemon abandoned\n\nThis problem was apparently solved by deleting the paniclog file\n\nA: The answers above are bad because you delete a log file and it's then gone for future log entries from exim. The solution is to create a logfile backup.\nMost Debian based distros use logrotate for this. You can force a backup with the logrotate command. Option -f is to force it and -v is for a more verbose output.\nTry (for Debian and also should work on Ubuntu).\nsudo logrotate -f -v /etc/logrotate.d/exim4-paniclog\n\n\nA: In my case, the passwd file was missing, which was causing the exim4 to panic. I added a new user, and that added the file, with the proper permissions, and the content exim expects to be there.\nIt seems that exim needs at least one local user, and that domain had all forwarding users.\nOnce I added a local user with a password, the errors stopped.\nYour mileage may vary.\n\nA: In my case the error was as follows:\nexim paniclog on my-host has non-zero size\n\nsocket bind() to port 25 for address ::1 failed: cannot assign requested address: daemon abandoned\n\nMy solution was to remove the paniclog file and do a dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config removing ::1 from the IPs to bind to.\n\nA: This blog entry seems to have an answer. Looks like it can have to do with IPv6 settings and results from a change in the way the kernel supports IPv6.\nBasically, disable IPv6 for now.\n\nA: You get the \"non-zero size\" warning if you have an unresolved error reported in paniclog and/or even if you resolved the error, you will continue to receive an alert/email until you hit your logrotate rotation limit, delete the file, or adjust/instruct logrotate to archive it sooner.\nIssue #1 - people are responding about particular errors in the paniclog which may or may not be related to the OP's. There are, however, hundreds of issues that can cause the same report.\nIssue #2 - regardless of what error is in paniclog, exim will continue to email you (even when resolved / fixed) until the file rotates or is deleted.\nIt is important to disambiguate between particular misconfigurations causing the report / paniclog, and continuing to receive the report despite resolving the issue.\nThere is no harm in deleting the paniclog file. Exim will re-create the file if there is a new issue, or if you never fixed the initial issue. However, I agree with @Jackfritt that the proper way to address this is with logrotate, as that will help one debug the initial issue causing the report. However, solving that issue will not stop exim or its mail agent from continuing to send the report; that requires logrotate or deletion.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create an installation disk of Ubuntu, from an already existing installation? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUse existing Ubuntu partition as an installation image? \n\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.10, and wondering if it is possible to create an installation disk/image from my existing installation.\nI need to install it on my friend's PC.

I have a home server running 10.04 configured with an mdadm-based RAID array. The boot and /home partitions are both on RAID-1 arrays, and I have a large data partition on RAID-5. There are three disks, with a partition from each disk making up each mdadm array--so three arrays (two RAID-1, one RAID-5), each with three disks, /dev/sda, sdb, and sdc.\nRecently, /dev/sda failed, and mdadm kicked it out of the array correctly. I replaced the drive, and am now trying to boot, but when I do, I get an error \"Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key.\" It seems that this is likely a message from my ASUS BIOS.\nIt seems to me that this is likely due to a missing boot loader. Am I correct in this? I'm guessing that since /dev/sda is likely what the system is trying to boot off of and since it is now a blank drive until I can boot to rebuild the array, that the machine can't boot. Oddly, I swear I remember installing GRUB to all of the disks and making sure they were bootable.\nI'm tempted to change the boot order in the BIOS and see if that works, but I'm worried that doing this might somehow corrupt the now degraded RAID-5 partition (not sure why... but I'd rather not do something I don't fully understand the implications of).\nHow should I go about fixing this? Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, it sounds like your BIOS is trying to boot from the first drive and not finding a boot record.\nIf you tell it to try booting from another drive instead, and it works, you can always break into the grub menu well before anything will try writing to any disk (you probably have the menu hidden - hold SHIFT to reach it).\nAlternatively, you can boot off a live CD if you have one, and setup the boot record on sda from there.\n", "Q: Dual booting Ubuntu 11.10 and Fedora 16 [ problem partitioning ] I have 320 gb hard drive.

For example, the Empathy messenger that comes with Ubuntu:\n\nbut assuming you want the actual Yahoo Messenger, the Yahoo Messenger running with Wine does not work (tested myself right now) and the Linux version for it is very old and gave me a weird error.

You can find it by clicking the letter in the notification area (next to your clock). When it launch, if you haven't setup any account(s) it will ask you to do so. If you already have accounts there you can just click F4 and a window for accounts will pop up. There you can add new account and from the drop-down menu you can select Yahoo.\n\nA: An acceptable alternative is Gyachi. you might want to give it a try. It definitely has more features than the conventional alternatives like Pidgin or Empathy, though it might have bugs ( developed only till 10.04 ,sadly )... But its worth a shot :)\nhttp://gyachi.sourceforge.net/intro.shtml\n\nA: i don't know why people are suggesting Wine, yahoo messenger won't work with that, at-least its calling features, and there is no other known ways to access its video/voice calling in ubuntu.\nThe best way is to Install Pidgin.\nsudo apt-get install pidgin\n\nor\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pidgin-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pidgin\n\nWith Pidgin you can't access any of the video/audio calling features, can do chatting and add friends.\nI think that's the best you can do with yahoo messenger in ubuntu, unless they introduce n Debian specific version, and that doesn't seem to happen in the near future.\n", "Q: Mouse get stuck some times When I Installed upuntu for the first time I log in and was going to update it like there were packages and I was trying to do other thing's like go on the web when the packages were going to be installed but the toachpad got stuck. I was wondering about this but I just don't know if it will do it again:( ???\n\nA: Try running sudo rmmod psmouse && sudo modprobe psmouse.\nThis unloads and reloads the touchpad driver. Doing this might alleviate the problem, at least temporarily.\n", "Q: Update wants to uninstall some packages I recently installed updates from the update manager. To my surprise I noticed that a bunch of installed applications were being removed.\nThe update was mainly some bug fixes for Compiz. There was no prior warning that these applications where to be removed in order to complete the update. Applications that were removed seemed to be everything I installed like Pidgin, Ardour, Webcam Studio, Sound indicator, most JACK related software.\nHas anyone ever had a Similar  problem? I'm now scared to update. Was this a virus? What do I do?\n\nA: There is no virus, uninstalls and installs are part of the upgrade process.\n", "Q: How do I find if a package is installed by default for each Ubuntu release? I know how to check if a package is installed and if its available for install but I cannot find any list of packages that are installed with a release from Ubuntu.\nSometimes I am trying to answer something and I cannot remember if the tool I will refer was installed by default of if I installed in a later point and cant remember. What if its something I have and a user using another desktop environment does not?\nI know I can recommend to install the package prior to asking him to use it but I would like to know if its installed by default or not.\nIs there such list? Where can I find it?\n\nA: Yes you can.\nWith each release, there is something called a \"manifest\" of the ISO created - this lists all the installed packages, their versions, etc.\nExamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://releases.ubuntu.com/hardy/ubuntu-8.04.4-desktop-i386.manifest\n\n*http://releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/ubuntu-10.04.4-desktop-amd64.manifest\n\n*http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.manifest\n\n*http://releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/ubuntu-11.10-desktop-amd64.manifest\n\n*http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.manifest\n\n*http://releases.ubuntu.com/saucy/ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.manifest\nNewer releases are listed at http://releases.ubuntu.com/\n\nA: Indirectly you could check Synaptic history of installation (In the File menu) type the name of your package you will know when it was installed or updated.\n", "Q: How to install Ruby plugin on Eclipse Indigo under Ubuntu 11.10 I've had no luck installing the Ruby plugin in Eclipse Indigo v3.7.1 under Ubuntu Oneiric. The Ubuntu community notes apply to earlier versions and don't help much with my setup.\nI wonder if you can point me at a more helpful on line resource/ set of instructions/ hand holding site?\nMany thanks for reading this far: I hope someone can help.\n\nA: If it throws an error about .eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.7.0_155965261/plugins/com.aptana.swt.webkitbrowser.linux.x86_64_1.0.0.1295409059/os/linux/x86_64/libcefjni.so:libjpeg.so.62 \nJust:\nsudo apt-get install libjpeg62 \nInstalled the full Aptana plugin on 12.04 LTS with eclipse from repo.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of a notification? I occasionally run applications that use the transparent notifications in the Ubuntu 11.10 desktop and they generally work fine for me except for when I'm running them over ssh with X11 forwarding. Those notifications dim but never disappear entirely, even after cycling in and out of the screensaver or switching to one of the other desktop panes:\n\nAny idea what causes this and how to get rid of it? The only thing that seems to work is to log out entirely. (I've checked and I don't even have notify-osd installed.)\n\nA: I would guess that restarting notify-osd would solve the problem. I haven't tried this, as I can't reproduce your problem, but as far as I can understand, it should work. \n", "Q: Ignore finger resting at the bottom of trackpad [unibody macbook pro] I have 2 finger scrolling working, and the three finger window movement works great, but something thats really bothering me is that I can't rest my thumb on the bottom of the trackpad like I can in osx. Is there anything I can do to make this work?\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 doesn't support proper detection of trackpads for macbook pros (I'm assuming it's an integrated button trackpad). This is changing in 12.04. However, for the time being I would recommend using this driver:\nhttps://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack\n(Thanks to C S for pointing out it's in the repos) Install the driver: xserver-xorg-input-mtrack \nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-mtrack\n\nAdd this to your xorg.conf file after installing the driver:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    Identifier      \"Touchpads\"\n    Driver          \"mtrack\"\n    Option         \"IgnorePalm\" \"true\" EndSection\n\nRestart your xserver (or computer) when finished.

It looks like chromium-browser @ https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa haven't been build for the past 6 weeks.\nI tried to get in touch with them on launchpad but I've got no answers...\n\nA: @micahg answers this question. In the meantime, my current workaround is to install a more recent chromium from this repository. You can add-apt-repository and install it as usual.  I didn't want the other packages from the repository so I pinned just the chromium packages to prevent the rest from installing.  Wrote a step by step in this answer.  There is also  another repository that has a new chromium mentioned here and fewer other packages so you won't need to pin packages, but the developer hosting that package currently is dissuading people from using it, hence my preference for the former repository.\nI hope at some point we have a more unified \"definitive\" place to get chromium rather than these disparate repositories, like it used to be with the chromium-daily channel which they are trying to get going again.\n\nA: Yes, unfortunately, the machine that the bot was running on was low on disk space (which preparing chromium uploads requires quite a bit).  I was going to try to do some manual uploads for the beta and dev channels.  I'm not sure how soon the dailies will be available again.  I can try to post here when the space issues are resolved.\n", "Q: How to autohide the Launcher in Unity 2D? In the regular Unity 3D, I used Compiz Config Manager where I could configure the Unity Plug-in to autohide the Launcher and not to show it when moving mouse to the left side of the screen. So it was perfect for using Docky.\nBut in Unity 2D the Unity Plug-in settings doesn't have any effect. How can I completely hide the Launcher and just have it shown when pressing the windows-key?\nWith the following:\ndconf write /com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/hide-mode 1\ndconf write /com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/use-strut false\n\nit still opens the Launcher when moving mouse to the left side of the screen. I'm using Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: There is a tool named Unity 2D Settings made by Krytarik Raido for configuring Unity 2D. It wasn't working under Ubuntu 11.10; however, he updated the tool and now works under Ubuntu 11.10.\nInstall it through terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:krytarik/tuxgarage\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-2d-settings\n\nRun this when you are logged in via Unity 2D.\nSource: OMG! Ubuntu!\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.04 there is an easy solution.\nTo make the launcher not appearing, you just have to rightclick on the Desktop and, klick background-preferences and there the 2nd tab.\n\nHere you have to check autohide and move the sensitivity to the very very left.\nThen you have a full-screen experience like here:\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to install ubuntu-restricted-extras without the MS fonts packages? Is there anyway to do install ubuntu-restricted-extras without the MS fonts packages?\n\nA: The package ubuntu-restricted-extras is a so-called \"meta package\". Such packages do not provide files themselves, but depend on other packages. apt-cache show ubuntu-restricted-extras tells me that the MS fonts (ttf-mscorefonts-installer) are recommended by the package, not mandatory.\nThe package ubuntu-restricted-addons is always installed when installing ubuntu-restricted-extras. If you want to proceed without installing the MS fonts, install this package directly:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-addons \n\nThe other recommended packages can be installed manually as well:\nsudo apt-get install unrar gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse libavcodec-extra-53\n\nIf a package depends on ubuntu-restricted-extras, after installing the above packages run:\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n\nA: Install the ubuntu-restricted-extras package. Then note the names of the fonts installed by inspecting ttf-mscorefonts-installer in Synaptic before doing a complete removal of that package. \nThen use font manager to disable the fonts whose names you noted.\n\nA: Done some research and trials. Turned out your can get the restricted-extras without MS fonts by ~ \n\n\n*\n\n*Using the software manager to install it and not accepting the terms for installing MS fonts when prompted. This will go on with the installation but omit MS fonts. \n\n*Use the offline installer script and remove lines that copy MS fonts to Ubuntu system. \n\n", "Q: Which version of Ubuntu is best suited for a Pentium 4 The question is pretty self-explanatory. I have a 2.8Ghz, 1GB RAM PC at my office. Windows is really slow on it and the Android Emulator never works properly on it. I am sure that Linux will definitely improve performance. What I can't decide is which version I should install?\nP.S. Where can I find older versions of Ubuntu?\n\nA: I see \"ph1b\" is best answer. You can download ubuntu 11.10, then update and finally download xfce or lxde desktop. lxde is lighter than xfce.\nYou can also download lubuntu like \"Vic\" said, but I tried and faced problem with it. I don't know why but you can try and you won't lose anything.\nAnyway I think if you download ubuntu 11.10 with the default unity 3D, you will not face any problem anyway because it's requirements are 1GB RAM and 1 GHz processor only.\nSo download ubuntu 11.10 and try.\n\nA: Try Lubuntu, which is now one the 'official' supported versions of Ubuntu. It uses a lightweight window manager and it fairly races along.\nThere are no problems using synaptic to install whatever you like, though it comes with some preinstalled lightweight alternatives to some standard Ubuntu progs and it uses standard repositories.\nRecommended.\nVic\n\nA: I'd recommend Using the latest Ubuntu and then not Using the standard-interface, but use another one.\nsudo apt-get install lxde\n\nThen log off, click in the loginscren on config and choose LXDE. Works pretty well on old machines.\n\nA: Definitely Lubuntu. It has always boasted low hardware requirements for an Ubuntu distro. Don't expect any fancy toys, but it's honest and simple.\nClick here for their site\n", "Q: How to install a software manually? I have recently learnt how to install programs from the terminal and would like to know the meaning of a few commands that I use to install. For example, I downloaded python 3.2 from source and extract and try to install it but failed. I saw in the explanation in other sites that I must use ./configure and make and make altinstall.\nWhen I do that, it installs the software but not the suggested packages. Why is that? And what's the meaning of ./configure and make and make altinstall? And why do all manually installed software be installed only by this or not at all?\n\nA: Why doesn't it install suggested packages? / Why do all installed packages have to be done by these commands only or not at all?\nThe commands you are using is to install the downloaded package alone, when the downloaded package is actually a binary source package. That installs just the downloaded package alone. In order to install .deb packages you can use dpkg and even better why not use trusted packages from Ubuntu sources to download packages? You can use the apt-get command for that.\nWhat's the meaning of ./configure,make and make install?\nYou can get a full understanding of what these commands are and what they do from this link and this link, but here is a short excerpt from one of them summarizing the commands:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*You run configure (you usually have to type ./configure as most    people don't have the current directory in their search\n  path). This    builds a new Makefile.\n  \n*Type make . This builds the program. That is, make would be executed,    it would look for the first target in Makefile and do\n  what the    instructions said. The expected end result would be to\n  build an    executable program.\n  \n*Now, as root, type make install . This again invokes make, make finds    the target install in Makefile and files the directions to\n  install    the program.\n  \n\n", "Q: System does not boot after changing partitions I have a Kubuntu 11.10 system with a HDD (sda) and an SSD (sdb). /home and /var and swap are partitions on the HDD and the / partition is the only one on the SSD.

It's mainly because of the drivers you install; hardware companies control programs for drivers are (often) not open-source, so alternate versions are often worse. Also in Ubuntu 11.10 many battery-saving features are disabled because they don't work for some machines.\n\nA: You could config the rc.local in /etc and add the following line before the exit:\nsudo rfkill block bluetooth\n\nso you deacitvate Bluetooth automatically. And there is a good program named Granola which reduces the battery consumption by undervolting your laptop when you use him for smaller things. If you run programs, that needs the power it automatically make the CPU-Voltage fitting.\n\nA: So people seem to ask this a lot.  Here's a link to several helpful suggestions.  Basically you need laptop-mode-tools.  Just installing that will probably improve your power consumption.  You can compare how your laptop was doing before and after installing that, by installing powertop first and making some observations for a time.\n", "Q: Can't boot after update, stuck on a loop Today I updated my Ubuntu 11.10 to kernel version 3.0.0-16-generic.\nAfter the update I restarted the computer and then I got stuck in a loop right after the initial screen where all the modules are loaded (showing an [OK] text on the right). All I see is the mouse pointer and then it goes back to that screen, and so on.\nIn some cases, I can see an error that says: initctl: Event failed.\nWhat should I do?\nThanks in advance,\nJonathan\n\nA: Finally I tried a more radical approach: reinstalling ubuntu using a livecd... it took me two attemps, the first one killed my video card, and finally the second one solved all the problems!\nThank you all for your help.\nJonathan\n\nA: As you mention you can boot from a live cd, you can reset the boot loader manually (which may be part of the problem.)\nBoot to the live CD\nDetermine the block storage device (hard drive partition) of the old system's boot drive, i.e. /dev/sda3 or some such (this is the location of your /boot files in the old system.)  By default, it's on the root partition, you can figure it out by doing in terminal:\nsudo mkdir /recover\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /recover\nls /recover\n\nThis is assuming your root or boot drive is on /dev/sda2, it may be on /dev/sda1-?? or /dev/sdb? or /dev/sdc? ; it would really depend on your system.  Assuming it's /dev/sda2...\nTerminal:\nsudo -s\nmount /dev/sda2 /mnt\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nchroot /mnt\n\nYou're now chrooted into your existing system.  Update the system to ensure that the upgrade worked.\napt-get update\napt-get full-upgrade\n\nthen to be sure the boot system is working, run \nupdate-grub\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\n(this assumes your on a single boot system with the disk device /dev/sda with just ubuntu, using grub2 as your boot manager.)\n\nA: Boot the older kernel. To do so, press and hold shift while booting. Then you'll get to the Grub menu. One of the options is something like \"Previous versions\". Then select the kernel you used before, and everything should be fine. \n", "Q: Reinstall Server over Desktop \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the easiest way to strip an desktop edition to a server edition? \n\nI'm a Linux noob and I've setup Ubuntu desktop on my web server thinking that the UI would help me out some.  Now I'm realizing that this probably isn't all the necessary since all my work is now done remotely to that box and I think I may have made a mistake.  I understand that the big benefit to Server is the lack of UI and extras that come with Desktop.  So my question is:\nWhat would be the simplest/easiest way to go to Server from Desktop?\n\nA: One quick method of doing this is in Terminal. Which can be done by pressing Ctl + Alt + T Enter the following commands.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-server\n\n\nA: I know you are looking for a simple and easy answer here but REALLY the best answer is to back your folders then do a fresh install of the server. Most of the redundant processes left over from the desktop are not needed nor are the many applications that enter into the picture when you install \"say KDE-DESKTOP\". All the library and binary files that follow the desktop installation clog the system.\nServer management can be done in many numerous ways which do not involve a local desktop interface. My favourites are puppet and webmin but you can find ones that works for you. EBOX would come to mind and might be promising. If you find that you can't live without a desktop GUI then go lightweight like LXDE.\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/install-gui-in-ubuntu-server.html\nhttp://alternativeto.net/software/ubuntu-cloud/\n", "Q: What is fuser and why is it so processor hungry?

In the default display mode, each file name is followed by a letter denoting the type of access:\n\nYou can track down the process from command line with\nps -ef |grep fuser\nIt will show a pid and a ppid if you follow that number you should be able to track down the program that issued it (and by what user and by what terminal).\nOr as said in a comment by Lakritsbollar use pstree.

If it is already integrated, how to execute MS-DOS.\n\nA: ScummVM\nFor classic adventure based on games SCUMM I would recommend ScummVM (page in Software Center). It is less versatile than DOSBox in that it only runs specific titles, but those titles generally run better in ScummVM than they do in DOSBox. Monkey Island and The 7th Guest are both supported.\n\n\nA: Here's one way how you can use DOSBox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dosbox using Software Center.\n\n*Install nautilus-open-terminal using Software Center.\n\n*Open the file browser (Nautilus) and go to the folder that contains your DOS game.\n\n*Right click on some empty space and select 'Open Terminal Here'.\n\n*In the terminal type dosbox . -- note the single dot at the end of the command.  It is important: it tells DOSBox that you want to make the current directory available as the C: drive inside the emulated DOS environment.\n\n*You'll get a DOSBox window with a C:\\> prompt.  Type the name of the executable (the file named something.exe or something.com or something.bat that you want to run)\n\n*Enjoy.\n\n\nA: DOSBox is a good solution, but Dosemu is a more powerful option; for example, in DOSBox you can't use a printer.\n$ sudo apt-get install dosemu\n\nyou can edit the configuration if it doesn't suit you:\n$ vi /etc/dosemu/dosemu.conf\n\nsee http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/dosemu.bin.1.html\n\nA: I also would recommend DOSBox. I also know for a fact that \"The 7th Guest\" will run using it.\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu doesn't ask me for password before login? When I had 11.04, there was an option \"ask for password\", something like this. I checked it out, and instead of password field I got \"login\" button.

If everything is working for you now I wouldn't make any further changes :-) However, you can reset your users configuration by purging pulseaudio and then reinstalling. This will remove the configurations which are potentially incorrect and put you back to \"stock\".\nsudo apt-get purge pulseaudio\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop pulseaudio\n\nThe second command to install ubuntu-desktop should reinstall the necessary pieces of alsa and pulseaudio (if removed above by the purge).

However, I can only listen the midi output when I actually export the files I am working on and can't listen anything when I am just inputting notes as I should.\nAny idea how to fix this?\n\nA: Most applications won't connect their MIDI output to any synthesizer/soundfont you use (same for the MIDI input). That means you will need to instruct the system where it should pass the MIDI data from tuxguitar, GuitarPro6 or anything else. The simpliest way to connect MIDI inputs/outputs is to use aconnect tool - it has GUI frontends aconnectgui and kaconnect (or patchage for larger setups with multiple apps).

I'm new to Ubuntu 11.10. My father has a dual boot of Windows7 and Ubuntu 11.10 but had activated a driver for his Nvidia integrated card when he installed Ubuntu.\nThe other day I installed a MSI Radeon PCI Express card in his computer but when I booted to Ubuntu all I got was a purple screen.\nI had read some things about going in to recovery but when I click it it doesn't do anything. Is this a conflict with the driver of Nvidia? Can anyone tell me step by step with commands on what I need to do to get his new Radeon card working? i would like to say thank you very much so far for your help.I did get the proprietary driver removed from the integrated nvidia graphics card  and a successful reboot back into ubuntu with nvidia open source driver.Then i shut down the computer and installed the radeon graphics card,when i booted up to ubuntu i recieved the same result of a purple blank screen.If i try recovery mode Iget nothing.I checked your link of is my ati card supported and it says it does support this card.My first question is should i run the sudo command in terminal that builds up before the drivers for ati before i install the ati card then reboot?i also noticed on the new ati card it says this\" Note that RadeonHD 6xx0 chips will need kernel 2.6.38 for open-source mode-setting, xf86-video-ati/radeon 6.14.0 for 2D acceleration (EXA/Xv), and Mesa 7.11 for 3D acceleration.\" \n\nA: You need to first remove the drivers that were installed by the Additional Drivers tool prior to installing you new card. Do the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the ATI card from the computer and boot to Ubuntu, it should load without issues\n\n*Open the dash and look for the Additional Drivers tool\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the Nvidia driver currently in use, it should have a green mark on it and once you select it the button on the right bottom corner will say remove, press remove and let Jokey do it's magic\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that there is not xorg.conf file loading any pesky drivers. Open a terminal and type sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old. This will save any xorg.conf (if any, if you get a file not found fault here move on and ignore it) in to a xorg.conf.old file inside the same directory.\n\n*Reboot\nIf all when well your system is not using the default open source drivers.

I understand that restart restarts the service whereas reload reloads the configuration. But I don't understand the practical implications of this well enough to determine which I should use in a given context.\nAn example: most guides I've read for setting up PostgreSQL say that, once I've edited postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf to allow remote connections, I should run:\nsudo service postgresql restart\n\nHowever, if I were to guess which to use based on the description above, I would choose reload.\nIn case it matters, I'm on Ubuntu 11.10, though I'm hoping for an as generally applicable explanation as possible.\n\nA: *\n\n*restart = stop + start\n\n*reload = remain running + re-read configuration files.\n\n\nA: What you said is correct, reload tells the service to reload its configuration files. That means it should be sufficient to reload the configuration; however there may be certain services that \"don't follow the rule\" or that won't reload config files. Due to this you're probably safer with restart. I personally do not use postgresql, so I don't know.\n\nA: To expand Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯ Ø§ÙÙÙØ± Ø§ÙØªÙÙÙ answer with my experience with systemd. \nIn systemd whenever a process is started it is run within systemd context, most clear example of this is with the environment variables defined in its unit file.\nSo when you send a systemctl reload [someservice] signal it sends a signal to the service to reload itself gracefully if it is supported. If not, the process will simply ignore the signal. This is configurable though.\nWhat do I mean with gracefully? to start new workers with the new configuration or code and stop the old workers as they finish serving current requests if any.\nAnd if you make systemctl restart [someservice] it will tell systemctl to tell the service to stop, destroy the current systemd context, create a new one and run the service again. This makes sense for example to reload environment variables in a systemd context or if a reload is not supported.\nHope this clarifies a little and if I'm wrong in something please let me know.\n\nA: Not all services support reload.  For those that do, it is usually preferable to restarting (i.e. reloading causes less or no downtime).\nThe Debian Policy Manual specifies that every /etc/init.d/ script should support a force-reload action, which means reload if the service supports it, and restart if the service doesn't support reloading.\nI'm not sure how that translates into the modern Ubuntu upstart world.\n\nA: Signal detail may be important for reload.\nMost of times it is all about sending a proper signal (SIGHUP) to service process. If the underlying application has some kind of 'live configuration re-apply' strategy, then most probably there should be a line starting with \"ExecReload=\" in the service unit file. Which means reload is optional and you need to check if the application implements reload: (docker i.e.)\ncat $(echo $(systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker) | cut -d \"=\" -f 2)\n\nRestart is just stop-start. Systemd only needs to know proper \"ExecStart\" command to start.\n\nA: currently if a service needs kicking (e.g. a config file changed) you can notify the service, but this leads to a restart. It would be nice if a reload was done if the service was already running (although I suppose there are bound to be some services which require restarts for some files, reloads for others).\nThe most complex example I can think of is something like Apache. Normally you can just ask it to reload, however sometimes you need to request a restart instead (if you add/remove modules for example).\n\nA: postgres is a good example for big differences between reload and restart, because the later has to disconnect all database-clients.\nwhen the connections should not rollback, you can stop the service without a \"--force\" at first by using pg_ctlcluster.\nin /etc/postgres/{version}/{dbname}/postgresql.conf and at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/ every parameter has a remark like \"This parameter can only be set at server start.\"\n", "Q: Trust GXT18 Keyboard not working (HID_MAX_USAGES) I'm an owner of a Trust GXT 18 keyboard that doesnât work with Linux..

It will work if i remove the icon from the launcher, then re add it. Is there a way to fix that? I am using Ubuntu 11.10 with the Unity desktop environment.\n\nA: That should work. If it doesn't, please file a bug. You can do that correctly by pressing alt+f2 and typing ubuntu-bug unity. Make sure you have upgraded your system before you do. You'll need to have an account at Launchpad.net, so if you don't have one, create one first. \nHowever, I'm not sure you are aware, but when you've pinned an application to the launcher, you get separate keyboard shortcuts for them. For instance, if Nautilus is the first entry on your launcher, then you can start it or switch to it by pressing super+1. If you want to launch a new instance even if you already have one open, you can use super+shift+1. This works for 1-9 and you can use the numpad if you want to.

For the rest of them, I use the numpad. \n", "Q: Cant log into Hotmail I am having the issue for about a month now, I used Lubuntu and then switched to Ubuntu; it started with Opera, I tried with Firefox, Chromium, Chrome, etc., the result is allways the same, I can not log to my Hotmail account; if I switch ti Windows, then I have no issue at all, except with Opera.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You may want to ensure you're using the correct password; did you save your password on your windows browsers?  Have you changed it?\nAnother possibility is that your system's clock may not be properly set.  If you're dual booting, you may have told Ubuntu you're using UTC time, when the system clock is actually set to your local time zone.

I know this is an Ubuntu forum but Mint is built on top of Ubuntu so I am trying here.\nThe Macbook Pro doesn't have a Page Down or Page Up button. Applications such as Epiphany and Terminal use these buttons to switch between tabs. Ubuntu and Mint both use APT so I assume all applications are the same if not extremely similar. You cannot re-key-bind the terminal nor Epiphany. So I tried the Keyboard settings app and Keyboard Layout app to see if I could change the keys. This proved futile.\nWhat I want is either to rebind the keys in Epiphany and the Terminal, or bind Page up and Page down to something else.\n\nA: I use a macbook air and the fn+up and fn+down keys provide page up and page down functionality.\nAlternatively, you can map additional keys to the page up and down functions, i.e. the right command and alt/option keys (honestly, how often do you use them?)  Some info on this can be found here:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmodmap\nThe short version is to use the xev program to determine what the key codes you want to change are, and create a program (say, ~/.Xmodmap) with information that remaps the key.  I use this to swap my capslock and delete keys using:\nkeycode 0x16 = Delete \nkeycode 0x42 = Backspace\n\nThen add the command \"xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\" to either your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc files, and then run the command xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap from terminal, and your changes should take effect.\n\nA: You can press Ctrl + fn + up/down\n\nA: I assume this same process will work for Ctrl as it did with Alt for me. Just be careful when testing the keys you assign using xbindkeys-config.\nI read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KeyboardShortcuts which helped me figure out the following. While the xautomation package that includes the xte tool might be used instead of xvkbd to emit the key codes I used xvkbd to do the same thing.\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xbindkeys-config xvkbd\n\nxbindkeys --defaults > /home/your-user-name/.xbindkeysrc\n\nFor some reason this added a binding for Ctrl+F that I had to comment out. While perhaps a useful default example I needCtrl+F to find inside of web pages.\nAfter figuring out the \"keysims\" of Prior for PgUp and Next for PgDown this wasn't too tough. Running and using xbindkeys-config resulted in the following entries in .xbindkeysrc for me.\n#alt-up\n\"xvkbd -xsendevent -text \"\\[Prior]\"\"\n    m:0x18 + c:111\n    Alt+Mod2 + Up\n\n#alt-down\n\"xvkbd -xsendevent -text \"\\[Next]\"\"\n    m:0x18 + c:116\n    Alt+Mod2 + Down\n\nwhen using Ubuntu 12.04 precise pangolin after creating the .xbindkeysrc file it was detected and the xbindkeys program was run automatically on my next login.\nSo this should do what you want.\n#ctrl-up\n\"xvkbd -xsendevent -text \"\\[Prior]\"\"\n    m:0x14 + c:111\n    Ctrl+Mod2 + Up\n\n#ctrl-down\n\"xvkbd -xsendevent -text \"\\[Next]\"\"\n    m:0x14 + c:116\n    Ctrl+Mod2 + Down\n\n", "Q: My OS disappeared (WIN7) on Acer Aspire Lap top including BOOT file Okay, I'm obviously an extream novice with computers no matter what OS!

Does anyone know if this range can be increased?\nThe grab area in the bottom right corner for instance seems to be a lot bigger, like 20pixels.\n\nA: In many window managers, holding the Alt key will make the whole window a big move/resize zone for the left and right mouse buttons, respectively. If not enabled by default, it is usually a setting you can edit.\n\nA: Grab at the corners.  It's substantially larger there.\n\nA: This is answered here - use the Gnome Tweak tool aka Advanced Window.\nBefore discovering this I tried 17 themes and none addressed this problem except that in SOME windows I got a slightly bigger area in the bottom right corner which I did NOT have in the shipped themes.

I had 2 packages wanting this glib version, and I'll mention popular one - Gimp 2.7.4\nI managed to find deb packages in Debian testing, and managed to replace glib 2.28 by making local temporary repository\nAfter this I launch gimp ./configure, and now it needs newer version of gtk+, then it needs newer version of pango, which needs even newer version of glib - 2.32, and I already messed enough with 2.30. I rebooted\n...that's not all. Now I can't login, it simply displays logon screen and stays forever. I go to netroot recovery console, but have no Internet. I boot in Windows and download glib 2.28, then I installed this with aptitude and reboot when famous error pops - no permissions for .ICEauthority, so I can't login still. Booting in Windows and searching showed me that this error is everywhere with all kind of solutions, some of which I tried without success, like deleting file, changing various permissions and similar, until I installed gnome-session package, which was mentioned as last comment on askfedora I think.\nThat's it. Now back on track and thought to share this.\nCheers\n", "Q: Switching my VM Base Memory for Win XP from 192MB to 512MB when I have 2.7GB of ram okay? Do you think that me using 512MB of ram for my VM Base memory with Windows XP when I am running 2.7GB of ram is okay? or should I return it back to 192MB?\n\nA: That completely depends on what else you run at the same time, but it should be fine. Track your Linux memory usage with free -m in a terminal window and if you start using even the slightest amount of swap, lower the RAM setting for the VM again.\nWhen the OS runs out of actual RAM memory (which is, relatively speaking, blazingly fast), it has to use swap memory, which is a file or a dedicated partition on your harddrive (which is really slow, relatively speaking -- hundreds of times slower than RAM). Obviously, you don't want your system to run into this situation. Hypervisors (the programs that host virtual machines) tend to allocate the whole amount of RAM that you set aside for the virtual machine since allocating it bit by bit (what normal programs tend to do) would negatively impact the performance of the virtual machine guest OS.\nThe output of free -m looks about as follows:\nusername@hostname:~$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          4025       1893       2132          0        306        956\n-/+ buffers/cache:        630       3395\nSwap:         4769          0       4769\n\nAs you see, the swap is not used in this case (\"used\" is 0). This is fine. But if you run many RAM-intensive programs, such as Firefox with a bunch of tabs (especially ones with Flash content), an image editor, and your virtual machine together, then you might be taxing your system's resources. If you computer feels like it's getting slower, you now know where to check.\nI would also like to comment on the reply that quotes Ubuntu's minimum system requirements: these do not take your running applications into account, so they refer to what you need to just get the basic Ubuntu environment up and running. Any application you run on top of that environment will also require resources.\n\nA: According to Ubuntu reqs it would be enough if You have left for it 1GB of RAM. For example I have done something like this:\nI have got a PC with 4GB of RAM, host is Ubuntu and the Guest is Windows 7. When I need to use Windows it means I need Windows at the moment, and not Linux, so my Win7 WM has 3GB of ram. The Linux is just working to run VM. But I don't run any apps on Linux in such situation.\nFor me such solution works really fine. So I think You could even enlarge the amount of RAM given to Your XP machine if necessary.\n", "Q: How to start evolution in a specific folder? having a problem with Evolution (3.2.2).\nWhen Evolution starts, it opens the last folder I've used.\nHow can I set that it should open alwaays the inbox after start?\nCouldn't find any settings.\nThanx in advance.\nW.\n\nA: This page says that you can provide the folder to start with as a command line parameter.

I'm the author of some software , which depends on libxx6 (In ubuntu 11.10) , but in 12.04 , the package become libxx7 (7 is not a Ubuntu version number) , so the dependency become a problem.\nHow can i work this out ? I'm managing a PPA , and i want to fix that before release of Ubuntu 12.04.\nThanks !\n\nA: If there is a generic version-free package you can depend on (such as in the Java case: java-runtime vs. e.g. java6-runtime), depend on that. If there isn't, you have to make specialized packages for the different versions of Ubuntu. Look at the package you depend on's control file and see if it Provides something more generic you can depend on.\n\nA: Assuming that your package will compile against both libxx6 and libxx7, simply us libxx-dev in the Build-Depends field of you debian/control file. Then in the Depends field us ${shlibs:Depends}. This will automatically be substituted with the version of the shared library that your package was built against.\nMore detailed information about shared libraries can be found in Chapter 8 of the Debian Policy Manual.\n\nA: If the same source will build on all the releases, then it's very easy. You build (upload) it separately for each Ubuntu release. You'll have to use slightly different version numbers, I suggest appending ~releasename1\n", "Q: Not able to change flash settings My Gnome crashes constantly when I open web pages containing flash so I tried to turn off the hardware acceleration.

But for others like the \"Enable hardware acceleration\" checkbox this won't work. \nAnyone knows how to solve it?\n\nA: The easiest way to disable hardware acceleration in flash is to do it in the flash player window from the right click > settings & un-check the box for hardware acceleration.\nIn many cases though the box can't be clicked. If that's the case then  you must not have scrollbars present so use F11 to fullscreen the window, then you'll be able to click in  the box. After doing so press F11 again to return to normal window.

I would like to access both via one monitor and keyboard.  Is there a quick and easy way to do this?\nWhat are my Ubuntu options?\n\nA: That is really two different questions, but yes it's both possible and easy. For future reference, please keep in mind that the more details you provide in your question, the more detailed the answers can become. \nI'll provide an example here. It'll be some text, but it really is quite simple. I'm assuming a desktop that has a large monitor attached, and a laptop. You want to use the laptop as a keyboard and mouse for the desktop by connecting it to the desktop using a ethernet cable. In essence, the desktop will feel like an extension of the laptop. \nThe networking\nThere are two steps for this procedure. First you need to setup network. There are many ways of doing this, but the easiest way is to open the network icon > Edit connections on your desktop. Select the network interface to be shared with your laptop and click Edit. In the dialog that appears, look under IPv4. There is a box called Method. Select \"Shared with other computers\". That's all there is to it. You can now just connect the laptop and desktop using an ethernet cable, and they will be in communication automatically. The laptop will get access to the desktops internet connection as well. \n\nMake a note of your computers hostnames. You can do that by simply opening a terminal. You'll see username@hostname:~$. If you don't like the names they have, then you can easily change them by running sudo nano /etc/hostname. Edit to something you'll remember, such as bambudesktop and bambulaptop. Only use a-z 0-9 and dashes. If you do change them, then you need to reboot afterwards. \nConnecting the laptops keyboard and mouse\nThe next thing to do, is to enable using the laptop as a keyboard and mouse for your desktop. This is also very easy. First, install the package named quicksynergy on both your desktop and laptop. It's in the archives, and you can click here to install it. \nRun Quicksynergy on your laptop. In the \"Share\" tab, enter \"bambudesktop.local\" in the top field and click Execute. That is the hostname you've chosen + \".local\". \n\nOn the desktop, in the \"Use\"-tab, there are two fields: server and screen name. The server is the hostname of the laptop, so enter \"bambulaptop.local\". As a screen name, enter your desktops hostname; \"bambudesktop.local\". Click Execute. \n\nYour desktop will now connect to your laptop. The laptop is the server. That is important to remember, as it might feel a little strange, though there are good reasons for it. You can now move your mouse pointer from the laptop and onto the desktop screen by moving it up from the top of your screen. When the mouse pointer is on the desktop screen, you can use the keyboard from the laptop. To move it back to the laptop, of course, you just pull it through the bottom of the desktop screen. It's like having an external monitor attached to your laptop. \n\nA: Since the question was about using a single screen and keyboard, I don't think that the answer pertaining to Synergy is what bambuntu is looking for.\nIf you have a single screen, keyboard, and mouse that you want to use with several computers you have two main options:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect the computers via a network and have one display its screen contents in a window on the other; or\n\n*using a specialized piece of hardware known as a KVM switch which was invented to solve precisely this particular problem.\n\n\nThe network-based solution can be implemented using a large number of different softwares, and you can install and try them to find which you find works best for you. Some good starting points on your Internet searching quest are VNC, RDP, NoMachine, and SSH X-Forwarding. I would recommend NoMachine above the others, since I've found that it outperforms the alternatives. The main benefit of this approach is that once set up, you can easily make it so that you can access your computer(s) via the Internet as well as via your local network, if you wish. The main drawback is that depending on what you do, the network transport is relatively slow, so you can't run e.g. graphics- or input-intensive applications this way (such as games).\nThe hardware-based solution requires a small investment in a KVM switch, but it may be well worth it. You hook it up to both of your computers via cables, and it allows you to switch between computers easily. The main benefit of this approach is that it works just as well should you at some point choose to run e.g. Windows or OSX on one of the computers (for games, Photoshop, or Microsoft Office, for instance) since the OS just sees the KVM switch as hardware that has been plugged in.\n", "Q: How to make use of RuntimeService in Ubuntu under UEFI boot mode? How to make use of RuntimeService in Ubuntu under UEFI boot mode?\nI want to make use of the runtimeservice of UEFI BIOS, SetVariable() or GetVariable(), and so on. What I need to do, and any lib for it? Please help, thanks a lot!\n\nA: These are accessible from the kernel context, so you can't easily do this from userspace. You can read the UEFI variables via the /sys/firmware/efi/vars but the data is in binary format, so one needs to decode this.  The firmware test suite (fwts) has a tool to do this, use:\nsudo apt-get install fwts\nsudo fwts uefidump -\n\n", "Q: Upstart Jobs and init.d scripts not launching I'm working on an Ubuntu based browser distro that is meant to be ran live.  Part of the security solution is to use sdmem when it shuts down.  sdmem wipes the available ram and is found in the package secure-delete in Ubuntu repos.  sdmem is not being called in the scripts below.\nI've had this solution working for another project set up the same way, so I know it works.  But sometimes in the other project on shutdown and restart I didn't always get the standard out that sdmem gives when wiping.  (Normally sdmem spits out a bunch of asterisks.)

Either a)\ntask\nstart on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[06]\n\nThis will delay the entire shutdown from even starting until your sdmem exits. Note that the 'task' is important there as the job will not block other jobs until sdmem exits.\nb)\ntask\nstart on some-other-late-hook-event\n\nAnd then edit whatever script in /etc/rc0.d/* (or /etc/rc6.d/*) you want to emit this event and have it do\ninitctl emit some-other-late-hook-event\n\nThat call in whatever script you want it in, will block until sdmem exits.

Selected pair is for selected text and the tooltip pair is used for the tips that pop up when you hover over a button or link. These colors may be applied by applications with varying opacity or shadings. The color of text in buttons comes from the fg_color.

I have it working perfectly, login to the full desktop environment with the Gnome(Unity 2D) and everything. Usually I connect to it via ssh or RDP and that does perfectly the job; or I have a monitor connected to the board's HDMI output, keyboard and mouse directly to the board.

HDMI is a client-server protocol, except they're called something different. Essentially one side produces content, and the other side accepts it. The designers of HDMI did it this way to make it harder to rip 1080p content right off the wire. There is no way to make this work (to my knowledge) without writing a custom driver for your HDMI port that says it's a TV or another display device (software may not even be enough, it might require a hardware hack)\n\nA: HDMI output from computers or cameras isn't protected by HDCP, just copyrighted material like movies from blue-ray disc players is protected.\nOn the other side, AFAIK Panda board has just HDMI output and no video inputs, so it is impossible to feed any HD video without additional hardware.\n", "Q: Printers get signal - but why don't they print in 11.10? (refers to Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric)\nI set up a printer connected via USB (Canon MP630) and a network-printer (Brother HL-2030 via Fritz!Box 3270). When I try to print something the files get sent to the printers (Ubuntu says so) and the printers get activated: They wake up from standby (if so) and (Canon) show a message \"start printing\" resp. (Brother) sound like they would start printing. But two seconds later everything stops and nothing happens anymore. Ubuntu said everything got printed.\nHow can I solve the problem and print again? How to gain more information of the process? Everything worked well in Ubuntu Natty 11.04.\nAnd it might be of interest that it is no problem to scan anything with Canon MP630, as well as I recieve status-messages.\nEDIT:\nI deleted both printers again, rebooted and installed them newly. Now it works partly:\n(Brother HL-2030) I used to choose the original Brother-ppd when it didn't print. When I took the Ubuntu-recommended one I now can print, but can't configure all the options I was used to configure (i. e. Sleep-Time ...)\n(Canon MP630) I can print now, but it is totally messed up: It prints 1mm-lines of colour and between each line is a blank line. So it prints only the upper part of an image and at all it looks pale and stretched.\n\nA: Found this on ubuntuforums.org regarding your Canon. People say it works on 11.10 as well.\n\nA: You could try checking in /var/log/cups to see if the error logs give you any extra information? (CUPS is Common UNIX Printing System)\nThe reason Ubuntu \"thinks\" it printed is because it was successfully spooled off the the printer (loaded into the printers memory). At that point, Ubuntu doesn't have to worry whether the physical printer finished its job. I haven't done much printing at all in Linux for years, but that's how I understand spooling to work.\n\nA: Canon MP630\nWorks fine with the original drivers, which I couldn't install due do dependencies. \nHow to solve this is described here. (It's in German, but I think understandable. You have to replace libcupsys2 by libcups2 in a text editor ...)\nBrother HL-2030\nAlso works with original drivers!

I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 and I have Ubuntu 11.10, and in my dell laptop it allow me to discharge the battery when I am using the power cable and that helps in the life of the battery, and I used to do that in Windows.\nThe shortcut to activate it is (FN) + (F3) but when I use it in Ubuntu it shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*AC adapter \n\n*laptop battery \n\n*processor \n\n\nand nothing helps in what I am looking for. What can I do ?\n\nA: Actually, discharging your battery doesn't necessarily help your battery life. Batteries are rated for x (usually 500 or so) discharge/recharge cycles before they suffer large performance decreases.\nIf you really want to extend the life of your battery you should take it out when you're plugged into the wall. Heat is what really kills battery life.\nIt's also worth noting that leaving your battery in while connected to the wall doesn't over-charge and harm your battery. Your computer/battery has built-in safeties that prevent that from happening, so when you're on wall power the batter is only being charged when it's below its maximum charge. But like I said above, if you really want to increase battery life you should take the battery out while on wall power as heat is a big toll on batteries.\nI think you were misunderstanding what what happening with the Fn+F3 combination. I've never heard of a battery discharging while the power was plugged in - unless the power cable was broken of course. The cable provides enough juice to both power the laptop and charge the battery at the same time. If you're plugged into the wall, you're only using wall power, not battery power to use your machine - so when it's plugged in no battery power is being used, how could it discharge?\nIf I'm not mistaken (and I very well may be - I haven't used Windows since 2007) Fn+F3 does different power modes in Windows. There's Performance mode, Power Save, and Balanced. I believe Fn+F3 cycles between these profiles in Windows, but when you're plugged in they don't make a difference. The only thing close to this in Ubuntu is CPU frequency scaling which is set to a governor of ON_DEMAND be default, meaning your computer runs at the lowest frequency (My Inspiron 1525 w/ 2.4Ghz Core2 Duo is 800Mhz lowest freqency) until more power is needed for a task. This helps with head and overall wall power usage when plugged in. It is possible, however to override it to use the POWERSAVE or PERFORMACE governors using the cpufreq-set command like so: cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance (replacing -c 0 with -c 1, -c 2, etc for all your cores). That will set your computer to use its max frequency all the time.\n\nA: I don't know if this is the answer you are looking for but I was using the Dell feature to prevent my battery from charging, even if my computer is plugged in. \n\nI am on a XPS 17 running on windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04.\n\nTo prevent my battery from charging when my computer is plugged in I first start my computer with windows 7, select the plugged in, not charging option,  restart my computer and choose ubuntu. It's a bit of an hassle but the only solution I found so far!\n\nA: Try to install software for Your battery. It is called smart battery or something. But Dell just turned it's back on Linux users, because You won't find such drivers on Dells website. Try to see who is the producer of Your battery and search its website for linux drivers. \nEventually upgrade Your bios and see if any new features showed up.\n", "Q: Binding capslock key to a shell script A linux newbie here!

Then, after a good minute or two, the memtest starts.\n\nA: I'll just make a different answer for this one. It's the same principle as the live-cd, but probably a little different than you did.\nEnter the LiveCD, mount your drive, note its mountpoint.

I'm assuming you also know the partition it's installed on? If not you can check the Gparted on the LiveCD to be sure.\n\nA: insmod gzio\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nsearch --no-floppy --file --set=root /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-16-generic\ninitrd  /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-16-generic`\n\nYou'll have to know your kernel version though\n\nA: It sounds like you tried something like this already, but I don't know exactly what you tried, so I'll post it anyway.  Pay attention to the X and Y and make sure you get them right.  I have used this method many times and it has always worked, but please forgive me if this is what you already tried.\nThis is a quick and simple method of restoring a broken system's GRUB 2 files. The terminal is used for entering commands and you must know the device name/partition of the installed system (sda1, sdb5, etc). The problem partition is located and mounted from the LiveCD. The files are then copied from the LiveCD libraries to the proper locations and MBR. If, for example Windows is on sda1 and Ubuntu is on sda5, and Windows has overwritten the MBR, then the target for grub installation will be /dev/sda5, and the MBR in the boot sector of sda will be re-written for grub.\nThis operation will write to the MBR and restore the modules and core.img to /boot/grub. It will not replace or restore grub.cfg or fix corrupted files.\nBoot the LiveCD Desktop.\nOpen a terminal window.\nDetermine the partition with the Ubuntu installation. The fdisk option \"-l\" is a lowercase \"L\".\n\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIf you're not sure of the partition, look for one of the appropriate size or formatting.\nRunning sudo blkid may provide more information to help locate the proper partition, especially if the partitions are labeled. The device/drive is designated by sdX, with X being the device designation. sda is the first device, sdb is the second, etc. For most users the MBR will be installed to sda, the first drive on their system. The partition is designated by the Y. The first partition is 1, the second is 2. Note the devices and partitions are counted differently. Mount the partition containing the Ubuntu installation.\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nExample: \n\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nNote: If the user has a separate /boot partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/boot Note: If the user has a separate /home partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/home. Encrypted home partitions should work.\nRun the grub-install command as described below. This will reinstall the GRUB 2 files on the mounted partition to the proper location and to the MBR of the designated device.\n\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX\n\nExample: \n\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/ /dev/sda\n\nReboot\nRefresh the GRUB 2 menu with\n\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: How do I move a window when two-finger scroll is enabled?

Open a terminal and run openbox --reconfigure to refresh lubuntu-rc.xml. After this, any time you access lxterminal from the keyboard using Ctrl+Alt+T, lxterminal will open with a size of 140 columns by 40 rows.  \nFrom the menu:\nThis requires editing of a .desktop file. By default, .desktop files are located in /usr/share/applications and could be edited there (using sudo).\nHowever, it may be preferable to make a copy of the .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications because editing this file only affects the specific user (and doesn't need sudo).\nSo, copy /usr/share/applications/lxterminal.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications. Then open the copied file with a text editor. Search for a line that starts with Exec= and change Exec=lxterminal to Exec=lxterminal --geometry=140x40. Save the file.

I use Ubuntu for gaming. In competitive gaming every millisecond matters.\nI know that many people who use Windows use something called Leatrix Latency Fix which is basically a script that modify TCPAckFrequency. This reduce the online gaming latency by increasing the frequency of TCP acknowledgements sent to the game server.\nOn Mac OS X you can get this effect by running \nsudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=0.\nI've heard that the Linux kernel have a very advanced IP stack and can use many different TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. I don't know if that has anything to do with TCP acknowledge frequency. I also heard that the Linux kernel auto-adjusts TCP/IP settings for optimal performance.\nIs there anything I can do to reduce TCP/IP latency?\n\nA: Well you should make sure everything else outside your computer is behaving nicely.\nRun a traceroute to the gaming server. Where does latency grow? Is it normal or is it happening in places where it shouldn't?\nFor example, a hop from New York to London will add latency. Fifty or so milliseconds to the first hop after your router probably means faulty equipment in your last mile; doublecheck with your neighbours.\nHow much latency do you have to your router? Switching from wifi to wired connectivity may not always be possible, but it might just shave five or so milliseconds.\nIs your computer good enough for the game? Sometimes game will have suboptimal performace under Wine, and well, if a game can't process packets in a round trip time (your latency to the game server as measured through pingor traceroute doubled) then the bottleneck is actually not the network.\nDoes your ping even matter? Most real time games require interpolation to run smoothly. This means you're actually playing \"in the past.\" For example, Source games have every player running 0.1 seconds in the past, which means all players with latency in the double digits actually are playing on a even field. Personally I play at 160 ping on TF2 servers in US and don't really have too much trouble with it. Read more here. Read here about the Unreal networking stack.\n\nA: My father was a big fan of TCP Doctor or some such program in Windows because he swore that his internet was sooo much faster with it. Personally, I never saw a difference. But, he did ask me how he could do it in Linux. He was so disappointed he couldn't use the program. So, I did my research. You are correct, Linux actively adjusts the TCP receive window and many other TCP aspects automagically. Unless you're having real problems, I'd leave it as it is.\nHowever, if you feel you must tweak it here is a decent-looking reference (but keep in mind, all these files they talk about are automatically managed and adjusted by the kernel unless you modify them at run-time): http://www.speedguide.net/articles/linux-tweaking-121\n", "Q: Record audio from Skype on VPS? I have impossible task to do! Going crazy!\nOn fresh Ubuntu server 10.04. install, via SSH I've installed desktop and VNC server.\nThen Skype.\nProblem is that Ubuntu is VPS! And it don't have physical sound card.\nI have tried everything that Google searching suggested, no luck!\nFor Windows system there is Virtual Audio Cable, that would make my life easier, but is there any solution for Ubuntu ?\nSome said that Jack is solution, but I can't find any step by step tutorial.\nI need to record Skype output! And \"play audio file\" to Skype input (mic).\nPlease help!\n\nA: I gave two solutions to another user doing something similar just the other day. \nThe problem with Skype is it's almost completely locked down, being a closed source application and the developers of it have a clear intended use for it (desktop/mobile), and not listening to server rooms. There are a couple of simlpe options though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pipe MP3 over SSH. This requires almost no setup, past getting arecord working on the server, installing lame on the server and installing mpg321 on the client machine.\nssh oli@bessy \"arecord -q -t raw | lame -x -r -\" | mpg321\n\nIf you have more than one client listening, it might be bandwidth/CPU heavy so you might want to look at the next option...\n\n*Use a broadcast-style application like Icecast or TeamSpeak because they're better designed for problem than Skype.\n\nA: I believe that with the PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol), you are able to redirect sound from certain applications to others. You can probably redirect the Skype output to an audio recording program although I'm not sure if that would work given you don't have a sound card. If that works, the inverse would also work; you would be able to play sound from one application and redirect it to Skype.\n\nA: If you have PulseAudio running on the machine you can achieve this by recording what Skype sends to the sound card (no matter if virtual or not) and what you speak into the microphone. I have a little script here:\n#!/bin/bash\nmonitor=$(pactl list | grep -A2 'Source #' | grep 'Name: .*\\.monitor$' | cut -d\" \" -f2)\nmic=${monitor/output/input}\nmic=${mic%.*}\ngst-launch-0.10 -e pulsesrc device=$mic ! adder name=mix ! audioconvert ! vorbisenc ! oggmux ! filesink location=$1 { pulsesrc device=$monitor ! mix. }\n\nHere, it looks for the sound card used for playback and taps its monitor. Then it looks for the mic input and monitor that. The recording is done by the gstreamer pipeline that starts two recordings and mixes them together and writes the audio as Ogg Vorbis.\nIf you save this script as pa-rec-monitor.sh you can start it as ./pa-rec-moonitor.sh filename.ogg. \nYou can check if itâs recording what you want by installing pavucontrol. On the Â»RecordingÂ« tab there should be two streams with the VU meters reacting to audio.\n", "Q: Change the whole system to hebrew, not only keyboard What is the way to make Ubuntu in hebrew, after I installed it?\n\nA: System Settings -> Language Support -> Choose one\n", "Q: How to disable the grouping of windows on the launcher?

You would see 10-20 firefox icons, all the same, and would first have to guess which one takes you to the webpage you wanted to go. Secondly, if you wanted to close them you would have to go, one by one and start closing them manually.\nSo we have 3 issues:\n\n*\n\n*If a user wants to open many windows of the same program.\n\n*If a user wishes to switch easily between all opened windows of the same program.\n\n*If a user wants to close many windows of the same program.\n\nWith this 3 issues an idea came to mind. Group them together in a single icon in the Launcher that represents the application in use and offer in a one right click solution, all the options needed to cover the rest of the issues.\nBetween 12.04 and the soon to be release 13.04, there has been much work put out to not only solve this 3 issues, but to help the end user work faster and easily, with just a minor learning curve. The end result (For 13.04 for example) is an icon that can deliver many windows of the same application and offers the possibility to change between them in  an almost one click solution. Of course, the option to disable it was never added (Even on 16.10).\nSome of this images can show you an example:\nNAUTILUS\nIn this example, I have Nautilus opened 4 times, one Nautilus is left opened on a folder called Docs. Another is opened pointing to HOME. Yet another is opened showing the Documents folder. One last Nautilus window is opened on a movie I have. By right clicking on the Nautilus icon I can easily switch between them by simply clicking on them. The window will maximize and gain focus, leaving me with a Window I can start working immediately.\n\nCHROME\nHere you can see the same example. Many Chrome Windows opened. Each with several tabs and each one showing the exact webpage where I left them:\n\nFIREFOX\nLastly, your example, Firefox. Here you can see several Firefox Windows opened. And each Window is shown when I right click on the Firefox launcher icon:\n\nNot only can I manage several windows of the same app quickly, but if the need arises, I can close them all with the \"Quit\" option in the launcher icon's context menu. Saving me time in case I had 20 Firefox Windows opened.\nI also felt the pain when I could not access my multiple windows in an easier manner, but after using this method, I found it was easier, quicker to search in, since I did not have to go through many launcher icons to guess which one is the one I was looking for, neither did I have to scroll down the Unity launcher between 20 Firefox Windows, 30 Chrome ones and 40 Nautilus ones just to get to the one I needed. Overall, it saved me time when I needed to find the correct one and work on it.\nAs you can see, it focused itself to be more productive to the end user, with just a slight touch in the learning curve.\nNow, if you actually wanted to have the option to ungroup them, it would involve, downloading the Unity source and any dependencies related to it. Modifying the code so you could actually ungroup them, by default or as an option, compile this and install it on the system, making your Unity be able to ungroup them as you wish. But in this case, I would ask, is it better than the solution provided by the Unity Development Team?.\nThis of course is left to each person to decide on how they like to use their system. In my humble and honest opinion, I feel the change made by the Unity team, solves several issues I had on 11.10 or even on 12.04 related to this, and the way it works on 13.04 is much better than I anticipated.\nCurrently there is no straight and specially easy way of disabling this option. Now, with all of this said, I do stand with the rest of the comments below in that, there SHOULD be an option to disable this. The user should always have an option. I have searched over a span of 2 years for an easy option to disable this or at least a script, with no luck. If however, you read this and find and option that is easy to apply without breaking the system, please share it as it will benefit everyone.\n\nA: This is by no means a solution to what is asked but may be helpful \nResearch shows there are a lot of people asking and wanting this feature that is being asked about.  There is bound to be a working solution.  Searching related questions here on Ask Ubuntu gives reference to gnome environment or others which may give useful building blocks for working it out for Unity.  May be time to accept there is not an easy solution for ungrouping windows in Unity launcher icon.\n\"Alt and `\" (Button above Tab) switches windows of app as does \"Super and  w\"  All credit to Jo-Erland Skinstad who answered this Ask Ubuntu question. Depending on the mouse (if any)being used  any keyboard shortcuts can be easily mapped to one button whether it be on mouse or keyboard which would give one click to show open windows and then one more left click to select which would make window switching slightly easier.  To remap keys look here or xboxdrv would be another option- \"It  is  also  possible  for xboxdrv to read input data directly from an event device, this allows the use of the configurability of xboxdrv  on regular  PC joysticks, keyboards and mice and thus lets xboxdrv serve a similar purpose as joy2key. See  the  option  --evdev  below  for  more information.\" as long as hotkey is not part of shortcut. Sure is doable with a little research.\nAdditionally an Ubuntu Forums user has filed a request for what you ask using Brainstorm.  Other Ask Ubuntu questions mentioning editing or making quicklist menu/icon for application may be possible for an advanced user but can only find working examples for gnome environment and not unity like shown here and they do not use Firefox as a working example.  The Ubuntu Forums question that is referred to can be found here and the Brainstorm request/idea can be found here So go get voting!\n\n\nA: I don't know if that's possible. However, each additional window of an application will add a new tick to the left side of that application's icon in the launcher (up to three ticks I believe). \n\nClicking the icon will bring up a screen of all the open application windows for you to select which one you want.\n\n\nA: If you want a taskbar you could try tint2. works great for me.\nTint2 Website : https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2\nFrom Webupd8 : Tint2 is a lightweight panel/taskbar intentionally made for Openbox3, but should also work with other window managers such as Gnome.\n\nYou can install tint2 by issuing the command sudo apt-get install tint2\nThen launch it through ALT+F2 and typing tint2\nIf you'd like to customize the position and the look and feel, there's an article on WebUpd8 with a GUI customizing tool here : http://www.webupd8.org/2009/09/how-to-install-and-configure-tint2.html\n\nA: If you need a taskbar icon/item per opened window, then solution could be to use gnome classic or Xubuntu components, not unity. For example Xubuntu (Xfce) works pretty well this way. Solution for you would be to install Xfce and start Xfce session instead of unity session. \nOn the other hand you will lost a lot of unity functionalities via alt and master keys, lot of keyboard shortcuts, etc. \nAdditionally, if you follow this question: How can I install XFCE along side unity? , you will find how to install xfce and additionally, there should not be any conflict between unity and xfce, so you can configure a new xfce vertical panel (just tested on Xubuntu) which contain just icons not names of the opened windows ad place it to the right corner for example. \nIt is not exactly what you need, but I think Ubuntu launcher does not support such functionality - this is a real life.\n\nA: Turning my comment into an answer:\nI think I will settle with avant window navigator (AWN) which has the option to ungroup windows and is very powerful and customizable.\nHowever it is not very stable (some window icons disappear after changing settings or relaunching and some of the launchers icons gets doubled when relaunching). Also it is not matching some windows correctly, such as eclipse and thus leaves a launcher icon at the same time as adding a task icon. Same for shortcuts to Virtual Box VMs.\nIf anyone knows a better alternative or if someone can tell me if patching unity for this would be a huge work or not, I would be glad to know ;)\n", "Q: what is proper formatting of xorg.conf file and what improper can do?

When i tried to go into recovery i could not navigate any of the menus. \nI'm currently in the process of a fresh install. \n\nA: The xorg.conf man page documents the correct format, and the generic options.   Driver-specific options are usually (but not always) covered in the man page for the driver.   In most cases, you can simply rename xorg.conf to another name to get X to start with a safe set of default options - xorg.conf is only needed when you want to change a setting from the default value to customize your setup.\n", "Q: deja dup backup will not launch I am running Ubuntu 11.10 with deja-dup (22.0~bzr1290.37~oneiric1 and duplicity 0.6.15-0ubuntu2.

I unchecked the \"auto-dimming\" option in System->Preferences->Power Management, but it still occurs.\nHow do I disable this feature?\n\nA: That's a general gnome setting. Assuming you got a recent version of ubuntu,\njust install dconf-editor and navigate to\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power. The idle-dim-time is what you want to change. The value is given in seconds.\n", "Q: I get a desktop but no icons or menu I see the Ubuntu 11.10 and the back ground but nothing else.  This is an older Toshiba running dual boot with Windows XP.  The cursor moves but I see nothing else on the screen.\nThis is my first try with Ubuntu, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Make sure that the task bar isn't just hidden.  Hit the meta(windows) key and and see if it brings up the Unity menu.  Alternately, just push your cursor against the left side of the screen.\n\nA: It's possible that you're not able to run Unity and it's not detecting that correctly.

To 64-bit Chrome, nspluginwrapper \"looks like\" a 64-bit Flash plugin. But so does a real 64-bit Flash plugin, which is preferable, so I'd guess that you recently got such a plugin and thus Chrome is no longer using the nspluginwrapper version. Have you got a chrome --type=plugin process? It's been there the whole time, but with nspluginwrapper, it's just a proxy for the real plugin that runs in the npviewer.bin process. For a native 64-bit plugin, the plugin itself runs there.\n", "Q: 11.10 slow graphic performance with ATI switchable graphics when using Virtualbox I am using 11.10 (on Virtuabox) on a brand new Samsung Series 7 with switchable graphics, which I am assuming that could be part of the issue here. \nThe graphics card is integrated Intel / and an ATI 6750M with 1 gigabyte of VRAM. I have Virtualbox (on Windows 7) set to the Maximum Performance setting so that it always kicks on the ATI card. I have Virtualbox set to use 128 MB (the maximum) of VRAM. \nAlmost all of the graphics are slow, if I launch Terminal it will take 5 or 6 seconds to even launch. If I type into the terminal, it will take 5 seconds or so for the characters to appear. \nHas anyone else had any issues with this?\n\nA: After more research, it looks like the issue is (surprise, surprise) with the switchable graphics. Even after instructing Catalyst Control Center on Windows to always use the dedicated Radeon, it still uses the integrated Intel GPU. To say I am not happy with Samsung at the moment is a complete understatement.....I paid for a discrete GPU, now I can't use it? This is apparently a widespread problem. \n\nA: I'm with a similar problem with no solution so long... I did not have any troubles on 11.04 but I had troubles installing the drivers for my Notebook GPU on 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot. I tried to install it many times and I don't know what I did but I got it to at least open the Catalyst Control Center... My Catalyst Control Center gives the option to switch from low performance power saving to high performance. The low performance is checked by default. When I check the high performance option, it says that the actions will take effect after rebooting the system. The problem is that I reboot the system and when I open the Catalyst Control Center again, the option did not change, it is still on the power saving GPU... I am not able to use the maximum performance of my computer's GPU : (\n", "Q: Script That Checks For Newly Installed Software Is there some service or event that is created when the deb installer installs new software?

I have installed ubuntu . I have a pppoe modem through which I use to access the internet on Windows. I tried to configure the modem on Ubuntu using sudo pppoeconf but it fails and says\n\nSorry, I scanned 1 interface, but the Access Concentrator of your\n  provider did not respond. Please check your network and modem cables.\n  Another reason or the scan failure may also be another running pppoe\n  process which controls the modem.\n\n\nA: Internet Connection Setup in Ubuntu (Wired)\nBefore I go into this detailed technical babble, I want to go over a basic check list for connectivity to the Internet.\nCable/DSL modem is powered on and is authenticated with your ISP (meaning, the âCableâ or âDSLâ light on the front is on solid, and you have a good connection to your ISP).\nYour cable modem is directly attached to your PC Ethernet port via a Cat5 Ethernet cable. If you have more than one PC in your house and you own a router see the next item:\nYour Cable/DSL modem is attached to your routerâs up link port via a Cat5 cable, and your PC is attached to one of the routers down link ports.\nOnce again: DOUBLE CHECK YOUR PHYSICAL LAYER and make sure everything is correctly connected.\n\nKind of like this:\n\nThe above is the standard connection scheme of a home network. If you have done the above, shoot for the moon and try to open Firefox and visit www.google.com. If it says the page canât be displayed, try clicking (inside of Firefox) Edit>Preferences and then select the Advanced catagory at the top-far-right, and then click the Network tab (see below).\n\nFrom there, click on the Settings button within the Connection zone of the window. This window will then appear:\n\nFrom here, make sure the âAuto-Detect Proxy Settingsâ radio button is selected (as above). Then hit OK.\nNow, close Firefox, restart it and attempt to visit www.google.com again. \nConnection Troubleshooting\n(skip if youâre not having any problems)\nTypical Internet users have to have the following equipment in order to get access to the Internet:\nA modem (Could be dial up, could be DSL, could be cable. All three perform the same basic function: Modulate and demodulate data as it is sent to and received from your Internet Service Provider, as well as assign you one single IP address).\nAn Ethernet Adapter.\nA Router (required if you have more than one computer in the house and you want them to access the Internet simultaneously).\n\nAnother networking device that is similar to a router, but inadequate for Internet connection management between more than one computer, is a Hub. Hubs are devices that do absolutely no routing of traffic with IP address, but instead, can only route traffic based on MAC addresses. Hubs were originally designed for LAN networks that did not need Internet access; only shared access between local, in-house computers. Hubs are also bad for security reasons, since they are nothing more than repeaters that echo all traffic out of every port on the device.\nBasic Internet connectivity requires IP address routing capability (a router, in other words), as well as default gateway and DNS addresses to either be known in advanced, or (much more often) auto-configured by the modem/router using DHCP. In Ubuntu, DHCP is enabled on all Ethernet devices by default. This means that when you turn your computer on, it should ask the router (or cable/DSL modem) âWhat is my IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway supposed to be?â And the router replies and assigns the client PC an unused IP address along with the rest of the requested information. In this way, multiple computers on a LAN can be dynamically assigned IP addresses by the router as they are needed.\nSo the first thing you should check is if your computer is being assigned an IP address by the router at all. A quick way to do this is to open Applications>Accessories>Terminal, and once it is open, type in âifconfigâ (which is short for Interface Config). The readout will look similar to this:\n\nIn the above screenshot, youâll see interface names listed down the left side (in this case, there are only two shown: eth0 and lo â which stands for âloopbackâ). These names vary depending on the type of networking device you are using. Another example: if you had more than one Ethernet adapter in your computer, you would likely see the second one listed here as âeth1â³.\nTo the right of âeth0â³ we see a lot of information written out for us. The âinet addr:â is your Local IP address. (In the above example, the IP address assigned to the computer is 192.168.73.129). If you have an address here, then that means your router/modem properly assigned you an address while booting your PC. If you donât see an ip address here, you can attempt to force your router to assign you one by typing in âdhcpcd eth0â³ and pressing enter.  (Note: dhcpcd is not installed by default.  To installed it from terminal, type âsudo apt-get install dhcpcdâ).\nAn alternative place to check and see if you are being assigned an IP address is System>Administration>Network Tools applet:\n\nUnlike the ifconfig command, you can only view the IP addressing information for one network device at a time in here. And other than that, you canât do much here when it comes to setting up your device.\nThe other place to check your network settings is in System>Administrator>Network. In here, you should select your Ethernet device and make sure it is in âRoaming Modeâ, which places the device into DHCP mode.\nIf youâre still not able to get an IP address assigned to your networking interface then the cause might be a bad cable, the modem/router may need to be reset or your network interface is broken or unsupported (rare).\n\nA: I am really not a specialist on the subject. But a quick search turned up these two results:\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/9556\nand\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ADSLPPPoE\nMy guess is that there is a driver missing for your ADSL modem. How you get the driver software is probably dependant on the modem manufacturer.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: \nThe Click On Edit Connection > DSL > ADD\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------OR--------------------------------------\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your ethernet wire to the port at the back of your computer.\n\n*Fire up the terminal and type in sudo pppoeconf\n\n*It should detect your modem.\n\n*Keep on pressing enter. Fill in your user name and password when indicated.\n\n*It should be easy to stick on to defaults.\n\n*You should be prompted back to your terminal when it would say pppoe loaded. Simple. That's the end of terminal.\nNow go to System>Networking.

But I am using dual boot (Windows and Ubuntu), so Ubuntu's hidden files and directories are easily visible from Windows.\nHow can I prevent people from viewing my hidden files in Windows, or how can I make a file hidden for Windows in Ubuntu?\n\nA: To hide files and/or folders in Ubuntu you have two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*add a '.' (without quotes, obviously) at the beginning of\nfile's/folder's name\n\n*List item if you don't want to rename the file/folder do this: in the same folder as the one in which are saved the files/folders you want to\nhide, create a new text file, and edit it writing the names of the\nfiles/folders you want to hide. Then save it and rename it as\n\".hidden\" (without \" too)\n\n\nTo see hidden files press CTRL+H.\n\nA: In Windows a file is set to hidden by setting attributes, so you can change attributes via Wine command line or DOSBox\nwine cmd\nattrib +h filename\n\n\nA: See if you want to hide your files/folder in ubuntu\n1.First open the directory containing your files.\n2.Make an empty text document named \".hidden\"\n3.Open this document and then write the name of first file you want to hide go to next line and write second file/folder's name.\n4.When you are finished doing description then save the document and after that press \"ctrl+h\".\n5.Your files should be hidden now.\n6.Thanx for reading this.\n\nA: Use some kind of encryption, that's the only way to 100% secure your files, on any filesystem.\nIf someone has physical access to your computer, nothing prevents them from taking out the hard disk(s), plugging them into another computer, and reading everything from there.\nEven without messing with the hardware, i wouldn't trust microsoft's ridiculous idea of \"security\" any day of the week. Even with everything set to the most paranoid settings, someone might easily be able to write and install a windows driver/exploit to read your linux partitions.\n", "Q: Tool to shutdown system when there is no network traffic I am looking for a script or a tool which I can turn on, when needed, which shuts down my computer if there is e.g. no network traffic for say 10 minutes, or below 100kb for example.\nWould be really handy for automatic downloading.

The reason it needs to be in root's cron is that you will not be able to shutdown your computer from the command line without being root, and you cannot use sudo while you are away from keyboard. There are ways to get around it but I am trying to keep it as simple as possible.\n\n*I use a linux tool called ifstat, so you will need to install this otherwise the script will not work:\nsudo apt-get install ifstat\n\n\n*There are 2 options that you can modify in the script below, the INTERFACE and MIN_SPEED. The INTERFACE needs to be set to the interface you are using to download, either eth0 for your wired device or wlan0 for you wireless device, you can use the command ifconfig from the command line to see what interfaces you have available.\nThe MIN_SPEED is set as desired, in my example I set it to the number 5, which means that if my download speed is less than 5 KB per second then my computer will shutdown.\n\n*Lastly, to improve on the script we could use a while loop and check the download speed over a specified period of time and if the average is less than the minimum we would shutdown, as well as run the script as a service, this is a more accurate way of approaching the problem and I will be happy to help you with that if this is the route you would like to follow.\nCopy and paste the below code into a file in a directory of your choice on your computer, example i_speed.sh, then, very important, make the file executable, to do this from the command line, if your file was called i_speed.sh as follows: \n    chmod +x i_speed.sh \n\nNow you can sudo -i to root and setup your cronjob to call the script at time intervals that you desire.\nCode to copy and paste into a file called i_speed.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Bash script to determine a network interfaces current transfer speed and \n  shutdown the computer if the current transfer speed is less than MIN_SPEED\n\n# Set INTERFACE to the network interface you would like to monitor\nINTERFACE='wlan0'\n\n# Set MIN_SPEED in KB per second that network interface (INTERFACE) speed \n  must be larger than, if speed falls below this number then computer will shutdown.\nMIN_SPEED=5\n\n\n# This is where the work get's done:\nCURRENT_SPEED=`ifstat -i $INTERFACE 1 1 | awk '{print $1}' | sed -n '3p'`\nINT=${CURRENT_SPEED/\\.*}\n\nif [ $INT -lt $MIN_SPEED ]; then\n    shutdown -h now\nelse\n    exit\nfi\n\nUPDATE\nI wrote a small python program as an update to the bash script above which allows you to set additional variables such as retries and interval to get an average min speed over a specified period of time. Further updates will include a GUI for this program. Just copy and paste the code below into a file, example download_monitor.py then run it as follows sudo python download_monitor.py\n## Download Monitor v0.1 - March 2012\n\n# Set the interface you wish to monitor, eg: eth0, wlan0, usb0\nINTERFACE = \"eth0\"\n\n# Set the minimum download speed in KB/s that must be achieved.\nMINIMUM_SPEED = 15\n\n# Set the number of retries to test for the average minimum speed.

The read/write privileges on the SVN server (a centralized repository) are determined by the program serving SVN over HTTP (likely Apache). Apache is running as www-data and cannot write to /home/svn/myrepo/db/txn-current-lock if it's not owned by you.\nI suggest you to start a svnserve daemon as the svn user and use that instead of Apache. The URL http://192.168.253.130/svn/repository then becomes something like svn://192.168.253.130/myrepo when using this initscript that basically invokes svnserve --root=/home/svn --threads as user svn.

That didn't work for me.\nI'd appreciate any help.\n\nA: I have a late 2011 Macbook Pro 8,1. What worked for me was indeed using a usb pendrive alongside the physical CD. I should also note that I used the 64-bit Mac image (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/11.10/release/) (edit: I read that you already are aware of it) (I honestly have no clue what the differences are, if it makes any.)\nI created a live bootable usb drive using unetbootin from the ISO, then inserted the drive after Ubuntu booted from the CD to its menu. Press a key once that Human logo comes up, then insert the drive when the menu pops up.\nAfter that, select to boot into the live desktop. It will fail to find the image on the disk, but will search the pendrive, and continue to load the desktop.

I now see updated notification for missed chats also.\nIs there a solution for this?\n\nA: I have this problem on 11.04 and 11.10.\nAs far as I can see, what happens is that PulseAudio dies, and then the next time Skype tries to play a sound (to notify about an incoming/outgoing message), it blocks.  And then does nothing.  The user interface is responsive, but the background thread that does the actual network communication (and plays sounds) is stopped and will not restart.\nPulseAudio restarts automatically, but Skype isn't smart enough to notice that and reconnect to PulseAudio.\nThe only way to make it work is to killall -9 skype and restart.\nThe easiest way to identify the issue is to notice that the timestamp of your outgoing messages stops advancing and always shows the same second.\nAs a workaround I went to Skype's configuration and disabled all sound notifications.  Now it never hangs.

If there was, then an anti-virus solution would be included by default. \nA daemon is just a program that runs in the background. Something happened to a process the update manager uses to install updates. It's nothing to worry about at all. Specially if everything works. If it doesn't, just run the update-manager again. \n\nA: The first time I got this message was today, doing the update that includes mods to OpenSSL.   \nI cannot agree that there is no danger of viruses in Ubuntu.

They will list updates much like normal ones in the Update Manager (unlike .Debs), and the admin of the PPA should not list the most recent version to sent to older systems if it is incompatible.\n.Debs provide none of these protections.\nBecause of that, and that the installation of LibreOffice with .Deb packages requires the download and extraction of several .Tar.gz archives and subsequent installations, I would recommend using the PPA, in the Terminal if possible (far faster).\nUnfortunately, the PPA is only for currently supported versions of Ubuntu.\nTo add the PPA, update the Software Sources, and update/install just libreoffice, execute:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\n\nIf you want to continue using the latest version tested (stable) for you, just run the Update Manager, check for updates, and install them regularly.\n\nA: there are no difference man you can use anyone only different that software download and install from something like ubuntu software center and repository are purport and easier for beginner user like to download and install without face any problem me and other thing no difference\nand about libre office man you can you download it from main site (download deb files because you use debian Distribution) and after that use this command with it sudo tar -xvf (name of download files) if it comperessd with tar.gz\nor use directly sudo dpkg -i (name of download files) if it download with deb extenison sorry i didn't download it before so i don't know any of that will be downloaded\nor best thing to download and install it automatic from ubuntu software center and write in search libreoffice and choose libreoffice writer and press more info and choose all add-ons and then install\nyou can follow this link to install libreoffice from terminal if you want that \nhttp://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/libreoffice\nlatest verison for libreoffice yet is 3.5.0 from main site \n\nA: The problem with PPA's is that those depends on their package maintainers which could also be third parties. I would download the official package in the Document Fundation download page and installing it with gdebi:\nsudo apt-get install gdebi-core\nwget http://mirrors.ucr.ac.cr/tdf/libreoffice/stable/4.1.6/deb/x86_64/LibreOffice_4.1.6_Linux_x86-64_deb.tar.gz\n## This link can change, is the 64-bit version for 4.1.6\ntar xf LibreOffice*_deb.tar.gz\ncd LibreOffice*\ngdebi *.deb\n\nOf course, there are more packages than what you would need, so just installing them by order is necesary.\n", "Q: Select on track of a midi file for playing with timidity $ timidity file.mid\n\nRecognizes the 4 tracks of my midi file:\nTrack name: soprano\nTrack name: alto\nTrack name: tenor\nTrack name: bass\n\nTimidity plays them all at the same time.

I'd like to start learning how to develop system settings dialogs using Python and GTK. What is required? I know Python and GTK well. The question is how to make the dialogs themselves. Are they built into system settings, or can we attach new dialogs at runtime? \n\nA: As of GNOME 3.2, upstream GNOME developers dropped support for adding \"external panels\" to the system settings in order to more tightly control what is present there. The relevant conversation can be found, starting with this message, on the GNOME desktop-devel-list. Ubuntu carries a patch to expose this API. Here is the relevant blueprint.\nIFAICT, python apps can not directly access the proper API, but they can still add themselves to the systems settings. They'll be show up there, but not be able to take advantage of the morphing window, bread crumbs, etc... They'll simply be called like an external program. \nIn order to place your app in the system settings, you need to add X-GNOME-Settings-Panel to the Categories field in your desktop file:\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Settings;X-GNOME-Settings-Panel;\nand add a new field to the desktop file:\nX-GNOME-Settings-Panel=program-icon\nIt must also contain OnlyShowIn=Unity;\nHere's an example of me forcing something in there:\n\n", "Q: Is It Possible to Install 11.10 on an HP Pavilion g7 Notebook? I recently purchased an HP Pavilion g7-1310us notebook with the intention of doing a full install of the latest version of Ubuntu on it. I succeeded in installing Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit, but not without difficulties. \nI couldn't find any guides for this new generation of HP laptops, so I'm posting this to aid others.\n\nA: Happily the answer is: Yes!\nThe main obstacle to loading Ubuntu 11.10 on the g7 is the video card. There is not a driver for the Intel video card. More information on the issue can be found here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11695329\nNOTE: I was informed on the Ubuntu IRC channel that this issue may not affect Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. So if you'd prefer an install that just works, you might try installing that version.\nIf you simply run the install CD for 11.10, you may end up with a dark screen that is virtually unreadable. To workaround this, these are the steps I followed:\nPart I: Installation\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit version and burn to a CD. If you're familiar with IRC and have a second computer, I'd also recommend logging into the Ubuntu IRC channel in the event unexpected difficulties arise. It helped me.\n\n*With the Install CD in the DVD player, restart the machine. Hit F9 to change the boot order and boot from CD\n\n*When the CD boots, a purple screen with a keyboard logo at the bottom will appear. Hit any key to get to the install menu\n\n*Hit F6, down-arrow to the nomodeset option and hit spacebar. An x will appear next to it indicating you have selected it.\n\n*Select Install Ubuntu from the main menu and proceed with install. This took me about 30 minutes and went without incident.\n\nPart II: Reboot\nOnce the installation is complete, you will be prompted to reboot your system. The nomodeset flag will not be set in your new install. You must interrupt the reboot to edit the bootloader and then, once the restart is complete, update the bootloader config file to avoid the dark screen issue. The changes are pretty simple. Follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*As soon as the system boots, hold down the SHIFT key to get to the grub (boot) menu.\n\n*Select default Ubuntu kernel at top and press E to edit the boot config file\n\n*On the line near the bottom that begins \"linux /boot\" and includes \"quiet splash\", add at the end nomodeset\n\n*Press ctrl-x to proceed\n\nSee the link here for screenshots: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 (I followed those directions but I've tried to clarify a couple points here that were frustratingly ambiguous when I first tried to follow them.)\nPart III: Update Grub Config File\n\n*\n\n*Once you're logged in, open a terminal\n\n*Make a backup of the grub file you'll be editing: sudo cp -v /etc/default/grub{,.bak}\n\n*Edit the grub file: sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Change the line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\n*Save and close file\n\n*Apply changes by running command: sudo update-grub\nAgain screenshots are available at the link in Part II.\nNow restart your system. It should restart without issue. If you end up on a very faintly lit dark screen, do a hard reboot and follow the steps in Part II. Then double-check the steps in Part III and follow them again. (I forget to run sudo update-grub the first time.)\nSince making these changes, I haven't noticed any screen issues or deterioration in the quality of my display. The only side-effect, as far as I can tell, is that when you choose Displays in the System Settings menu, it will say \"Unknown\" and all options will be grayed out.\nHopefully a driver will show up soon. More information on that topic can be found here:\n[2-link limit exceeded: see askubuntu.com/a/95480/46766]\nIf you know of a better solution to this issue, please share it. (The one recommended in the link above -- using the ATI driver -- was strongly discouraged on the Ubuntu IRC channel.)\n\nA: Answer from above helped me, but not entirely. After system I installed system, restart was needed. I waited, but nothing happened and I restarted laptop manually. After that, system booted, I heard the sound, but without display. \nI entered console mode - Ctrl + Alt + F1, and console showed up. Then, I typed sudo apt-get install fglrx. The package was downloaded, installed and everything started working.\n\nA: I'd like to add something to this very very helpful post.\nAfter fighting with a Pavillion g7 laptop to get it to run 11.10, I had issues with it booting.  It would hang while booting.  I'd get this far:\nBad LUN\nBad target number # (this error is repeated several times)\n\nIt's something to do with the AMD Video drivers, apparently.  After spending some time finding a solution, this page solved my problems: \nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Natty_Installation_Guide\nGo through the steps listed from \"Before you start\", down to \"Generic Config\" with only one change: \n $ sh ./amd-driver-installer-12-3-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/natty\n\nneeds to be changed to \n  $ sh ./amd-driver-installer-12-3-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/oneiric\n\nAfter going through this, I was able to boot to the desktop and finish Part 3 above.  The laptop works great now.\nI hope this helps anyone else having troubles.\n", "Q: Where is the file used by file(1) and libmagic to determine mime types? According to man 5 magic:\n\"The file /usr/share/misc/magic specifies what patterns are to be tested for, what message or MIME type to print if a particular pattern is found, and additional information to extract from the file.\"\nSo I went looking for that file:\n$ file /usr/share/misc/magic\n/usr/share/misc/magic: symbolic link to `../file/magic'\n\n$ ll /usr/share/file/magic\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 2011-08-08 13:52 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2011-10-12 07:27 ../\n\nSo it would appear that the file specified in the man page is in fact a symbolic link to a directory which is empty.  Where is that file on my Ubuntu 11.10 system?\nThe reason I want to look at it is that both the file --mime command and the python magic module are returning the same incorrect mime types for some files, and I'd like to see the format of that file so I can modify the relevant associations responsibly.  Thanks.\nUPDATE:\nThanks to @Caesium for pointing me to the strace command.  Piping the output from that to grep magic, I got the following output:\nopen(\"/usr/lib/libmagic.so.1\", O_RDONLY) = 3\naccess(\"/home/phoenix/.magic\", R_OK)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopen(\"/etc/magic.mgc\", O_RDONLY)        = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nstat(\"/etc/magic\", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=111, ...}) = 0\nopen(\"/etc/magic\", O_RDONLY)            = 3\nopen(\"/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc\", O_RDONLY) = 3\n\nSo it would seem that file first looks in /home/username/.magic, then /etc/magic.mgc, then /etc/magic, and finally in /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc to determine file types.  This suggests that the proper place to add user-specific association rules is in /home/username/.magic, and system-wide rules in /etc/magic. I chose the latter option.\nFor the record, here are my additions to /etc/magic:\n# python: file(1) magic for python modules and scripts\n0 string \"\"\" a python script text executable\n!:mime text/x-python\n0 regex #!\\ .*\\ python a python script text executable\n!:mime text/x-python\n# pyc file: first four bytes are magic number\n# which changes with each python version.\n# this is for version 2.7.2:\n0 belong 0x03f30d0a python compiled\n!:mime application/x-python-bytecode\n\nThe man page for magic discourages the use of \"regex\" (for performance reasons), but I thought that this would be the simplest option for me.  I hope this helps others solve this problem, should they run into it--the files which are now detected as text/x-python were previously identified as text/x-java by libmagic, which seemed frankly ridiculous.\n\nA: You were almost there; it's in /usr/share/file/magic.mgc:\n$ file /usr/share/file/magic.mgc\n/usr/share/file/magic.mgc: magic binary file for file(1) cmd (version 7) (little endian)\n\nAs a slight aside, I actually found this just by looking around a bit, but you can prove it's actually using that file via strace:\n$ strace file /\n<snip lots of output>\nopen(\"/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc\", O_RDONLY) = 3\n<snip a bit more output>\n\n/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc is just yet another symlink.

I'm aware that binary are..well.. binary and source are compiled scripts you run yourself.\nMy question is moreso, what grounds would you choose one over the other?\nWhy is a binary driver more stable and source considered faster?\n\nJust on that note. When I say source drivers, I don't mean nouveau. I mean the drivers you download manually from nvidia and run the scripts yourself.\n\nA: The drivers that you download from the Nvidia site are, as you know updated. The drivers you have on the Ubuntu repositories are updated only upon a Ubuntu release or when there is such a huge problem with them that can only be fixed by upgrading the version.\nThe only way you are going to get updated proprietary drivers for your Nvidia card is by either using the driver downloaded from the site or adding a PPA.\nFortunately the Ubuntu team keeps a PPA where you can get the most recent version of the Nvidia drivers, updated and packed for your system.\nYou can add it and upgrade your drivers to the same version released by Nvidia using the following commands in a terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\nyou can then install / upgrade your drivers using the packages from the added PPA\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nThose drivers are updated every time Nvidia releases a new driver version.\nThe main difference between installing form the Nvidia site, the default packages released with a Ubuntu release or the drivers from the PPA is the support and where to report bugs to.\nAnother main difference is the way to remove them, the drivers installed via PPA or distributed with and Ubuntu release will be removed with apt-get while the driver provided by the download from Nvidia has it's own removal procedure.\n", "Q: localhost subdomain wildcard I'm trying to have *.localhost pointing at 127.0.0.1.\nI read this post which is quite recent and looks promising but dnsmasq can't bind port 53:\n* Starting DNS forwarder and DHCP server dnsmasq                                                                                                              \n dnsmasq: failed to create listening socket for port 53: Adresse dÃ©jÃ  utilisÃ©e\n\nDoes anyone know what's wrong or any other way of achieving?

After that, when you click Close, it should ask if you want to reload your software sources, click yes.  \nNow, go to System Settings â Additional Drivers, and see if there is anything there that you can check.

Is it a possible hole of security having /tmp/ folder under user owner instead of root?\nI have set it temporally under my user by mistake, after that its impossible to bring it back to root user: Ubuntu after that doesent recognize my session.\n\nA: I don't think there's an inherent risk if /tmp doesn't belong to root, but it should belong to root following best practices (it's a system directory).\nAlso, note that the /tmp directory permissions must have the sticky bit set:\ndrwxrwxrwt  4 root root  4096 2012-02-19 19:56 tmp\n\nThis way, files created in /tmp can be read and written only by the user that creates them. Not doing this is indeed a security risk as users could write or delete files that belong to other users or processes.\nRegarding your session, I believe you should be able to solve this by changing the ownership from a console, while the X system is down (go to a TTY console with CTRL+ALT+F1, service lightdm stop (or service gdm stop), change ownership and reboot).\nTo change owner and permissions, you can use:\nsudo chown root:root /tmp\nsudo chmod 1777 /tmp\n\n", "Q: How to install GTK2-notif2 theme?

I tried replacing icons in the respective folders, but that didn't seem to help.\n\nA: If you examine the icon set in /usr/share/icons you'll find that within each icon set folder there are folders with the same names and within those folders are icon groups by size and within those folders icons for the same purpose have the same name. That means you can substitute icons from other themes that you prefer. I believe the icons your interested in are in the status folder. Some icon sets are more complete than others and some icons are used under multiple names by using links to point to a single image. Within folders like status the sub folders are by size with the svg folder containing scale-able icons. Once you've made changes to these icons you'll need to restart. I'm unsure if logging out and in is enough or if restarting unity will do so I just restart the system.\n\nA: Use the gnome-tweak tool sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak.

(According the backgroud info) \n3) If is the firewall on or bad configured can I do something to set up it correctly or swich off?\n4)If I do something from no. 3 will it have bad impact to my security (virus protection on internet)?\nNOTE: I have few theoretical info about linux, newtorking, firewalls, but I don't have many experiences with linux configuration and practical using these things.\n\nA: I'm assuming that your server (which is also your client in this case) is behind a NAT router from the internet. If this is the case, a firewall on linux is not strictly needed. (There will be tin-foil hatters out there that say everything needs a well configured firewall.) \nThe output you have shows that there are no rules in effect and so the default is to let everything pass. So the problem likely exists elsewhere. Start by running your server program and then running \nlsof | grep IP\n\nand looking for the name of your program or the port 10000. If you don't find it on the list, then your program did not manage to bind a socket to a port. In that case, you need to do more error checking in your C code. If you do see your program, then look into a program called wireshark. Running wireshark while you run the client will allow you to see if your client is sending packets correctly. A filter like (tcp.port == 10000) should yield at least half of the conversation, depending on how your server works.\n\nA: The default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu is ufw. Developed to ease iptables firewall configuration, ufw provides a user friendly way to create an IPv4 or IPv6 host-based firewall.\nufw by default is initially disabled.

Here is a screenshot of my GParted:\n\nSo, my question is:\nAssuming I launch Ubuntu from a LiveCD and I get to run GParted how should I give space from the home folder to the root folder knowing that the SWAP is in the middle?  What is the correct process to minimize the risk of screwing up?\n\nA: I recently did this. Be careful to boot your computer from a live cd of the SAME version of ubuntu as you have installed, if you can. (I'm superstitious!)\nThen start Gparted.  From here on it is a slow sliding block puzzle.\nClick on your /home partition, then right click it and select 'Resize/Move. When the graphic pops up, use your mouse pointer to take hold of the left hand handle of the /home partition and slide it right to shrink the partition as much as you need. Click on the Resize/move button, then the green check mark on the toolbar and the shrinking will start -and it will take a fair time to complete.\nNow click the swap partition, then right click it and select 'Resize/Move. When the graphic pops up, use your mouse pointer to grab the middle of its graphic and slide it right until it butts up against the /home partition. Then click the Resize/Move button, then the green check mark on the toolbar to move it. When this is done, there will be space on its left to fill up with the /root partition.\nClick on your /root partition, then right click it and select 'Resize/Move. When the graphic pops up, use your mouse pointer to take hold of the right hand handle of the / partition and slide it right to bring it up against the swap partition. Click on the Resize/move button, then the green check mark on the toolbar and the expanding will start -and, again, it will take a time to complete.\nI know, I know, I could have done the whole sliding block thing in one go and then clicked on the green check mark just once, but to me the process feels less risky doing each move independently. You WILL back off any irreplaceable files before you start, won't you?  A power cut could prove disastrous... Wordy though my solution is, this is the simplest, entirely graphical way, if you can believe that!\nFor added security, you could install Boot Repair on your hard disk (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair) . Then if you find it has all gone wrong, you could use a SuperGrub2 CD to boot your system and then run boot repair to fix grub.\nGood luck,\nVic\n\nA: The simple way is to delete the swap partition, shrink /dev/sda7, expand /dev/sda5, then recreate /dev/sda6 as swap.

When I want to play a song via youtube in Tomahawk it does not play the song. A pop-up appears and asks me to find the missing plugin which is 'Quicktime'. But there is no chance to install this plugin. As far as I know I installed every codec.\nOS: Ubuntu 11.10 64bit / Tomahawk 0.3.3\nWhen I remember correctly it worked with 11.04, but I am not really sure. But it once worked. Now I cannot play youtube-songs at all.\n\nA: It may be a bit late, but I had rather the same problem with Tomahawk version 0.5.0 under Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe solution is to install the phonon-backend-vlc package instead of phonon-backend-gstreamer\nas they told us on the website\nhttp://www.tomahawk-player.org/download.html\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Firefox.\n\n*Load the page normally.\n\n*Click in the Firefox menu on Tools.\n\n*Go to Page Info.\n\n*Click on the Tab Media.\n\n*Scroll till you find the URI with the quicktime video (usually .mov).\n\n*Copy and paste the URI/URL hit Enter.

It sort of treats it like it's one big desktop, in a way, except instead of smoothly scrolling, it flips by a full screen.  But it follows the cursor, so you don't need to move all the way across the screen to return to the previous desktop.\nI personally find it very annoying, and I don't use it, but I'd guess it's probably better if you're used to it.  Maybe it's even handy, but I've never really tried.\nIf you don't have it enabled, it still has settings for where on the screen it's triggered, much like the setting for the reveal mode.

Examining this script shows that it is instructions to the shell for executing commands - and it seems that it runs python scripts, making it essentially a kludge of monstrous proportions.  I've seen other builtins behave in a few ways\nNo output:\nMe:~$ wait\nMe:~$ true\nMe:~$ test\n\nAn error, with no usage hint:\nMe:~$ select\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'\n\nAn error, with usage hint:\nMe:~$ source\nbash: source: filename argument required\nsource: usage: source filename [arguments]\nMe:~$ return\nbash: return: can only `return' from a function or sourced script\n\nI'm having trouble understanding why set behaves in this way. It seems undocumented, and I wasn't really expecting it. I'm troubled as to why this happens. Can anyone explain?\n\nA: Those 8k lines are mainly completion functions from the bash-completion package. On my old desktop, bash uses almost a second to read through and define all those functions, most of which I never use, so I disable it.\nTo disable it, edit your ~/.bashrc, locate these three lines near the end, and prepend a # to each of the lines.\nif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then\n    . /etc/bash_completion\nfi\n\nNext time you run an interactive bash session, set will only output about 50-100 lines; mostly environment variables and special shell variables.\n\nA: From http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html:\n\nIf no options or arguments are supplied, set displays the names and values of all shell variables and functions, sorted according to the current locale, in a format that may be reused as input for setting or resetting the currently-set variables.\n\nThe same documentation, but with some examples, can be found at: http://ss64.com/bash/set.html, and the command help set gives a summary of that information.\nSo the behavior you describe is indeed correct.  I agree that it would be nice if there were a --help option; generally when all of man set, apropos set, which set, and whatis set fail to be helpful, I will try to pass --help as an option.  Doing so prevents a command from running with unexpected results, as it will either give me a help message, or trigger an error.  In this case:\n$ set --help\nbash: set: --: invalid option\nset: usage: set [-abefhkmnptuvxBCHP] [-o option-name] [--] [arg ...]\n\nI find this trick to be a useful failsafe.\nI should point out that the first few Google results for \"bash set\" led me to this documentation.\n\nA: Try running set | more and watch near the bottom of the first screen.

Note that you will probably want to ensure that /var/www is not unmounted when root logs out.  To do this, just rm -f /root/.ecryptfs/auto-umount.\nFull disclosure: I am one of the maintainers of the eCryptfs project.\n\nA: See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1655933\nHowever, since the key is unlocked on boot you still won't gain anything unless ofc if someone enters your serverhall, removes your disk and then tries to gain access to it w/o testing to put the disk into any other computer (of the same architecture) and tries to boot it up.\nYou COULD possibly do a full-disk encryption (bad idea since you won't be able to decrypt your computer via SSH) or so that you'll have to unlock the encryption, but then you've ended up with a server that cannot be rebooted without having to worry about maintenance afterwards.\n\nA: If you've already encrypted your home folder then you can easily point apache to read a subdirectory inside ~/ through a symlink.\nThat's how I set up my system.

Please be careful and do not launch the chmod command using the recursive option on your home folder, use it just on the document root folder as follows:\nsudo chmod 0755 /home/francesco\nsudo chmod -R 0755 /home/francesco/www\n\n\nA: I would suggest you to encrypt only the files in the www folder instead of encrypting the entire folder. The same will decrypt in memory when the file is called. \n", "Q: How can I change the icon in Thunderbird's \"New Mail\" popup?

In the process of the update a window popped up in which I had to choose the default display manager. Being in a hurry, I just clicked \"ok\" (gdm was the default selection in that window). Afterwards I found out that Ubuntu 11.10 us es lightdm so I figured, that maybe this was the cause of my problem. Before this update everything worked fine.\n{What I tried so far to do to fix it [skip this, if its too long] I logged in as root in recovery mode and tried to reinstall lightdm. Using the apt-get command I get error that spans over 3 lines of text, the first of which is\nNot using locking for read only lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock;\n\nbut I don't know of any process that is using apt-get, that is preventing it from being run.\nAfter that I used  dpkg-reconfigure lightdm  and selected lightdm as the default display manager.

I played around a little bit by also trying dpkg-reconfigure gdm\nand choosing gdm instead of lightdm, but none of that helped. The system still hangs, just with different lines of text showing up, but \"* Stopping System V[...]\" is always the last one. }\nOther info This may be or not be relevant: I use multiple operating systems (the other ones work) and the kernel I use is 3.0.0-15-generic-pae.\nPlease help, I invested so much time in setting my Ubuntu system up, I don't want to do it all over again.\n\nA: Actually, what's going on is when you go into recovery your disks are mounted as read-only. I just did this and for some reason the Mount Disk option didn't work, so I just hit the 'root' option and used:\nmount -o remount,rw,errors=remount-ro /\n\nThis makes your drive writable. Once you do that you should be able to do your dkpkg-reconfigure lightdm\nIf it still says \"read-only filesystem\" then do the opposite and start a disk check:\nmount -o remount,ro /\nrootpartition=$(cat /etc/fstab | grep -E \"# / was on .*installation\" | awk '{print $5}')\ne2fsck $rootpartition\n\nIf you can't remember that big long rootpartition= string, you can also get the device by going to /dev/disk/by-uuid use the file that is a big 36-character string (it should be the only one if you don't have any other Ext partitions).

I think it removed /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf but left /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf (which has a reference to unity-greeter.conf) unchanged. That makes sense why it wouldn't boot, though I didn't think to look and just re-installed unity-greeter once I worked my way past the read-only issue I was having.\nAnyway, give it a shot!\n", "Q: Is it possible set gnome 3 fallback panel font Is it possible to use a font for the gnome panel which isn't the default font.\nI tried to define the font  inside a gnome theme but that doesn't chnge anything and \nif i write something like : gtk-font-name = panel-menu=fontname in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini nothing change.\n\nA: You could probably do this by editing the CSS for the panel in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css.\nSomething like this might work:\nPanelWidget,\nPanelApplet,\nPanelToplevel {\n    font: Sans 20\n}\n\nI'm not sure I've got the selector completely correct though.

After doing so and pressing the power button once again to start the system, I selected the Ubuntu partition (dual boot machine) and it now doesn't boot at all. I can boot the other OS, which is Windows 7 ok.\nThere are a list of I guess internal commands listed on the screen and the last command was \"Stopping Mount network filesystems      [ OK ].\nI've tried hitting Ctrl + Alt + Del and the system will restart but will get locked up again on boot.\nIs there anything I can? I've had this happen before and being a newbie I just reinstalled the system but after this happened again, I really don't want to reinstall.\nSuggestions are always welcomed! Thanks!\n\nA: You didn't mention if you could boot your 'other' OS. If you can, then, barring something really obscure, you can discount a problem with the hardware.\nIf a laptop, -this will sound nuts- try closing your machine down, disconnect the power cord and then remove the battery. If a desktop, close down and disconnect the power cord. Wait 10 minutes and then replace battery and power cord. Then try a restart. If lucky all will go fine. Just don't ask me why it sometimes works: I'd guess it lets some capacitor or other drain down.\nIf no go, try this:-\nYou didn't say if your machine is using grub or grub 2. Grub is pretty much on the way out so I'm going to assume you're on Grub 2.  This is a little problematic because although you can possibly boot from Super Grub2 disk (the one I use as a standby is v1.98), it can't repair Grub2, just boot it.  Since the object of the exercise is to find if you have a bootable system, just boot from the CD (download and burn first!) and a list of options will appear.  The top one will likely be something like \"Detect any OS\". Select that and see what happens.  \nWith luck you'll see what appears to be a normal Grub2 screen. Select Ubuntu and see what happens. If the machine boots normally, then likely you have a grub problem and you need to repair Grub2. There are plenty of ways to do this, but one of the neatest once your machine is running courtesy Super Grub2 disk is to installthe Boot Repair utility. Open Terminal and enter:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nThis adds a ppa to your repos list.\nNow enter\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\nThis installs Boot Repair and runs it. That may do the trick for you in short order.\nI hope this helps.

In recent Ubuntus the menu has been pulled up into Unity's panel. That's great, but it's not for me. I'm using the Gnome 3 fallback panels for my desktop and like my menu's like they always were.\nJust using the fallback/Classic mode does most of what I need. Applications have their menus attached but only after a short delay. It's as if they start without the menu and then the menu is added back after it realises there's no Unity to handle it.\nNormally this wouldn't be catastrophic for anything but it's really  annoying for Image viewer and other things that spring up their window based on the size of some media, only to have a menu jump in and ruin everything. Here's an example I risked my life to record and show you today:\n\nHow annoying is that?! It goes from 100% (lovely) to a cruddy 94%!\nSo, yes...

Just a thought.\n", "Q: several start-up scripts? I want kubuntu to ask me at start up - which of the profile I want to use. There should be a default answer which should run automatically in 3 seconds. Much as if were Grub asking You which operational system You would like to start.\nThe rational to have several start-up options: normally I have a lot of things starting by default: krusader, firefox, konsole, emacs... So the full loading takes about 1 minute. But sometimes - I'm on the run, and need just to do some single thing - so I'll need only, say krusader. I'd've made several start-up scripts... So I'm  wondering - is it possible to choose between them at start up?\nPerhaps that could be done with Grub...\nEdit:\nGrub didn't asked me about the start up profile at all - that is not even \"Normal mode\" or \"Recovery mode\". I made him do it with Grub Editor (the package is called kcm-grub2):\nsudo sed -i '$ a\\deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:ksmanis/xUbuntu_11.10/ /' /etc/apt/sources.list\nwget -q http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:ksmanis/xUbuntu_11.10/Release.key -O- | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kcm-grub2\n\nAfter the installation and restart, in System settings -> Startup and Shutdown new item has appeared: Grub2 Bootloader.

You could power on the computer, choose the profile and then return when everything is started. But I don't know how to use parameters from GRUB.\n\nA: With the help of @Lekensteyn, I made a version where you can select the profile in GRUB. The creation of the custom menu can be still improved probably.\nStep 1: create custom GRUB menu\nYou need to create GRUB menu entries with an additional parameter. You can follow this instructions. So copy your default entry from /boot/grub/grub.cfg (the lines with menuentry ... { ... }) to /etc/grub.d/40_custom.\nThen edit (the copied entry in /etc/grub.d/40_custom) the line where it says linux /boot... and add at the and of a line seperated with a space:\nproductivity-profile=1\n\nYou can also edit the name of the menu entry, so change the part menuentry 'Ubuntu, with... to something like menuentry 'Ubuntu (Profile 1), with....\nAdd such a menu entry for each of your profiles (with a unique number each).\nYou can remove the execute permissions from the other files in /etc/grub.d/ in order to remove these menu entries. Don't forget to run sudo update-grub afterwards.\nNote that after a kernel update, you'd have to change your grub menu manually if you follow this instructions! (You can improve this answer and describe how to edit the scripts in /etc/grub.d/ accordingly.Â´)\nStep 2: check if Step 1 was successful\nReboot and select one of the profiles. Then run in a terminal:\ncat /proc/cmdline \n\nYou should get something like:\nBOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.... root=...  productivity-profile=2\n\n...where the number at the end of the line has to be the chosen profile.\nStep 3: Adopt script to your needs and run it on start up\nThen use this script to run your start up scripts:\n#!/bin/bash    \n\nprofile=$(cat /proc/cmdline |sed 's/.*productivity-profile=\\([0-9]\\).*/\\1/g')\n\necho Running profile $profile ...\n\ncase $profile in\n   1)\n      # Run script for profile 1\n      ./script-profile1.sh\n      ;;\n   2)\n      # Run script for profile 1\n      ./script-profile2.sh\n      ;;\n   3)\n      # Run script for profile 1\n      ./script-profile3.sh\n      ;;\n   *)\n      echo Error\n      ;;\nesac\n\n", "Q: Will new ubuntu install be able to read/write to software raid 5 array created by a previous install?

Under Compiz :: General Options :: Desktop Size I already have 2x2 layout of 4 virtual desktops setup, as in screenshot.\n\nHowever if you notice as in the switcher app parked in the top left corner, only one desktop shows, and indeed only one is available to send windows to or hover over to.  \nRight-clicking that docked switcher to \"Add a workspace\" doesn't behave right anymore.  It's like the desktops are too independent and trying to send windows to Right/Down isn't an option anymore from the Alt Space menu. Nor do hotkeys CTRL-ALT-Arrow work to slide over anymore.  Double-Clicking does switch desktops though, but it's like they're in otherwise unrelated Xwindows sessions(cannot be, of course).\nFor a while I've been stuck with a stubborn 1x1 or 1xN layout, unable to figure out why it won't go to 2 columns, until I discovered the Compiz :: General Options :: Desktop Size :: \"Number of Desktops\" had mysteriously gone to 0. Horizontal and Vertical were both still 2 there.  (Weird things happened when I next made that 0 into 4--Switcher at first drew 16 virtual desktop boxes, after which I decided to collapse everybody into 1 desktop and start again from there.)  My ~/.dmrc contains only: \n[Desktop]\nSession=cairo-dock\n\nI noticed each has a title now: Work / Game / Video / Chat, maybe they were present before I had to reboot from a total Xwindows unresponsive freeze(though switching back and forth from text consoles Ctrl Alt F1-F6 still worked) twice, but I don't recall titles before.\nAfter some updates to cairo-dock and many other packages since Feb, notice 16 workspace boxes manifested themselves again, though only 4 seem switchable via ctrl-arrow keys:\n\n\nA: Turns out the virtual-desktops layout setting in ccsm may not be the same as when you right-click on the virtual-desktop app, wishing to add or remove workspaces.  Can't seem to PrtSc while viewing the right-click menu of the upper left switcher/workspace/virtual desktop preview app, but the 3rd and 4th items down the list are Add a workspace and Remove last workspace.\nSo I selected the Remove last workspace a few times till it returned to the 2x2 layout, and consistent with what's actually in ccsm\nUPDATE (again)  \nTo spare others aggravation & unclear documentation(if any) the Switcher applet and CCSM virtual workspace/desktop settings indeed are independently-minded. Not only that, their initial appearance after a fresh startup may actually be different than how they will behave. For instance, the Switcher applet docked in my upper-left corner in the screenshot, showed a big 1 and only one single box at first, but as soon as you try sliding to another desktop, it magically updates to show boxes 1-4.  This glitchy startup appearance had me definitely fooled before, troubleshooting configs in vain, when it probably was ready to behave all along.\nFor now I recommend keeping CCSM at 1 virtual desktop not 4, and instead let Switcher manage your 2x2 or whatever layout.  Shortcuts etc. finally seem to remain more consistent across restarts this way, for me, and now I know to disregard the initial appearance of only one desktop.\n\nA: The number of desktops should be 1 in compiz.  Zero is an illegal number and cannot normally be used.  It's a bit confusing, and I've personally never found a use for any number other than 1.\nI used to use Cairo dock, and it worked fine, using the Compiz settings.  Adding a new workspace would add a new row, which in your case should give you 3 rows x 2 columns.\n", "Q: Swap partition is being corrupted by running Ubuntu from a USB stick The question I have is a little complicated, I'll try to walk you through the problem: \nBasically, I installed Ubuntu 11.10 onto a USB thumb drive that I formatted as an ext2 partition. I didn't want to go the Live USB route because I wanted full control over all the files on the partition. Because I installed it on a USB stick I chose not to create a swap partition (to decrease disk I/O and because I wouldn't want to hibernate my USB stick anyway).\nAside from that, I own an Asus EEE PC netbook that is running Oneiric as well, but obviously with a separate swap partition.\nNow, my problem is as follows: Whenever I decide to boot up Ubuntu from my USB stick (whose partition table doesn't include a swap partition or any partition outside of the USB stick), that seems to corrupt the swap partition on my netbook. I'm not sure as to why or how that happens, but basically when I boot back into my regular Ubuntu on my netbook, it tells me that the headers of the swap partition are wrong/corrupt (I don't remember the exact wording). In order to get my swap partition working again, I then have to:\nsudo mkswap /dev/sda8 [my swap partition] && sudo swapon -a\n\nThis workaround is fine, but it's a real hassle. Also, it gets me thinking what might happen to other people's systems if I put my USB stick in their computer. I haven't tried that yet, but it seems a real possibility that it might screw with their setup as well. \nAnyhow, I really have no idea what's going on because the fstab on my USB thumb drive doesn't mention a swap partition, but I'm guessing something must be going wrong when Ubuntu does a disk scan to check for mountable partitions. \nAny thoughts? \n\nA: Comment out the line in /etc/crypttab on your flash drive install.\nIf you set up encryption on your flash drive install, then it looked for swap and securely wiped it. The actual swap definition is in /etc/crypttab and refers to a device rather than a UUID like you'll see in /etc/fstab on a non-encrypted Ubuntu install.\nIf this is true, it should probably be a bug. Because you probably didn't tell it to use the swap partition on your netbook during the install process (default is \"Don't use\")\n", "Q: How can I change the boot order (grub2)? \nPossible Duplicate:\nChange the grub boot order for ubuntu 11.10 \n\nI saw guides of setting first operation system to boot.

I'm only interested in the Google part of it since that is all that is available at the moment.\nI want to understand if it stores my password in any way - I get the impression it uses some kind of token authentication but I don't understand this. Is it possible to steal a password (or similar?) from my computer through g-o-a? \nAll the documentation that I have found is far too complex for a normal person to understand.\n\nA: Short answer: You can probably trust g-o-a if you use Twitter, Facebook and Google-accounts and you're faced with a login-page that looks native to those services (e.g. a facebook-styleish login box instead of a GNOME-styleish one). Edit: However, always assume your accounts are compromised. g-o-a might not be the weakest link, but the more links you've got on a chain, the more likely it is that one of it is going to be weak. Always treat your data carefully.\nLong answer:\nDepending on what service you use it either uses a \"token authentication\" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth ) or clear text passwords. The worst case scenario for e.g. Twitter is that someone sends spam with your account, but they won't have access to sensitive data (however, if you store passwords in Chrome/Firefox - that's an entierly different matter) and the \"hackers\" cannot steal your password or change it. You can just go onto the security settings (on Twitter) and then delete the OAuth-token for your g-o-a.\nThis is different for different services. On Google (and Facebook), you can specify app-specific passwords if you're worried about your privacy. If these passwords are stolen, you can just delete them.\nAt the end of the day, exploiting g-o-a might not be that valuable unless you're actually targeting a specific person you know runs GNOME, since most people (I dare to say) stores their passwords in Firefox/IE/Chrome, which both should be less secure and more common - like telling a child not to steal candy from an open candy jar and then go away shopping for an hour.\nIf you're worried about g-o-a, you should always reset your browsing history (and cookies etc.) in your browser when closing the browser and not running any unofficial Facebook apps etc. \n", "Q: Low disk space \"Filesystem root\" Running 11.04 \nLow disk space warning.

In 11.10, it's lightdm, recent past versions use gdm. Change the following examples as appropriate for your version. You can restart it a few different ways. I prefer the simplicity of the restart:\nsudo restart gdm\n\nOr you can use the service command:\nsudo service gdm restart\n\nInit script hackers stuck on sysv will prefer invoke-rc.d:\nsudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart\n\nIf it's really hung..\nIf restarting the display manager doesn't work, pull out a hammer and kill it dead with one or both of these commands:\nsudo pkill -9 X\nsudo pkill -9 gdm\n\nWhich example should I use? Does it matter?\nUse the first one. restart is a link to initctl, which is Upstart, which is Ubuntu's init manager that they are trying to convert everything over to.\nThe other two commands, service and invoke-rc.d are there only to control the old-style SysV init scripts. SysV exists in modern Ubuntu only for backwards compatibility. Don't rely on it. But if you must..\nservice is for end-users. It returns a simple exit code. If you're a normal user needing to control a SysV style init script, use this tool.\ninvoke-rc.d is for init script hackers. It returns a bunch of varied and useful exit codes. There's no reason a normal user should use this tool. There isn't any harm for normal users, it's just more complicated.\n\nA: sudo pkill X does the job for me\n\nA: I found a much easier way to restart the GUI.\nIn most cases you can just use:\nAlt+PrintScreen+K\n\nA: Try invoke-rc.d gdm restart as root.\n\nA: If CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE doesn't end the current X server and plop you back in lightdm or gdm then there is an alternate sequence (which I've personally never tried) that goes like this: ALT+PrintScreen+R-E-I-S-U-B, however this will actually reboot the machine. My preferred method is to just CTRL+ALT+F1 to get to a terminal and then sudo service gdm restart and that will also bring you back to the login screen\n", "Q: How may I upload my source package with active ftp over dput to launchpad my question is how can I upload my source package ( I already got the .sources file) over the active ftp method with dput to my launchpad ppa? \nmy .dput.cf file looks as follows:\n[cooking]\nfqdn                    = ppa.launchpad.net\nmethod                  = ftp\nincoming                = ~gotwig/lens-cooking/ubuntu/\nlogin                   = anonymous\npassive_ftp             = 0\n\nmy command is \ndput cooking lens-cooking_0.1_source.changes\n\nThe traceback is: \nGood signature on /home/gotwig/lens-cooking_0.1.dsc.\nUploading to cooking (via ftp to ppa.launchpad.net):\nUploading lens-cooking_0.1.dsc: 425 Can't open data connection.\n\nIt seems to me, as it want to use passive_ftp instead of active one.. I cant use passive ftp becouse of my router.\nIf there is a way without a configuration file, I would be even more happy.\n\nA: That config file should get you attempting active FTP, if it doesn't, it may be a bug. Launchpad uploads over both passive and active work for me.\nI recommend using sftp, its better all around.\n\nA: Are you sure your router disallows passive FTP? it's usually the other way around, and the trace indicates it has trouble opening the data connection (as opposed to the commands connection) - this further reinforces the belief that the router is also blocking active ftp.\nYou can use the --passive parameter to dput. As you mention below, active is the default.\nIf not, you may want to look into using SFTP (assuming it's unblocked by your router) as a transfer method.

After that I couldn't find the files even when using Ubuntu.\nMy files were simply GONE :(\nIs there something I can do in Ubuntu or is it just windows problem?\n\nA: It happened to me as well. After reading a lot about this on internet I came to know that this happens when Windows is in Hibernate mode. There are already some related questions here on askubuntu and also on superuser.\nFiles disappear on NTFS partition\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/144720/missing-files-when-windows-7-returns-from-hibernate-w-dual-boot\n\nA: I have a similar setup to you. I hibernate Windows 7 with a NTFS 'shared' drive, edit the files in Ubuntu, then start Windows 7 to find the changes gone.\nAs a few workarounds, use an external hard drive or USB drive for your shared files, or\nmake a hibernate.bat file with the contents (change D:\\ to your drive)\nmountvol D:\\ /D \nshutdown /H\n\nand a startup.bat file with the contents (change D:\\ to your drive)\nmountvol D: 'VolumeName'\n\nRun hibernate.bat to hibernate Windows (don't hibernate from start menu!) \nRun startup.bat when starting Windows\nAlso, you may need to disable Windows 8's 'Fast Startup' function\n(source)\n\nA: If you hibernate windows (or purpose or because of power-saving), then use ubuntu to store files on the NTFS partition, and then boot up windows, Windows thinks the disk was corrupted while it was in hibernate and \"fixes\" anything different. After that loging back into ubuntu just confirms that the files have in-fact been deleted. \nAlso I have seen that windows 7 may do a chkdsk after it installs updates on shudown when you bring it back up windows does extra tasks related to installing updates, so be careful not to boot into ubuntu after shutting down from updates. http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/windows-chkdsk-deletes-files-written-by-ubuntu-on-an-ntfs-partition-913606/\nYes even on a shared partition seprate from the windows partition and take care even with fat partitions (usb drives).\nSources, https://superuser.com/questions/211079/what-do-i-have-to-take-care-of-when-hibernating-both-ubuntu-and-windows-dual-bo/211175#211175 , https://superuser.com/questions/39532/hibernating-and-booting-into-another-os-will-my-filesystems-be-corrupted\nEdit: I was looking through the widows site to try and find if they detailed the hibernate process, but this sounds interesting http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd143253(v=winembedded.5).aspx , It seems at best the write caching from the harddrive is being saved to memory, then being written after bringing the drive back up, this may mean that the files can't be recovered, because it's not \"deleting\" as in removing the first letter of the file so the system does not see it, but actually overwriting large areas of data that have been cached. Needs to be looked into more.\n\nA: I faced the same problem in win8. Could not access the files saved in fat32 partition in ubuntu from win8.

Run mongo in virtual machine with 64bit ubuntu?\nFor now I need mongo only for dev purposes, but my test database consists of 3kk entities so I'm afraid virtual machine will be inefficient. \n\nA: According to the KVM FAQ while it is possible to run 32-bit guests on top of a 64-bit host, \"the only unsupported combination is a 64-bit guest on a 32-bit host\".  So virtualisation will probably not help you in this case.\nThe PAE extensions really only help if you are running many processes, each of which need less than 4GB of address space.  While the extension allows the operating system to manage more memory, it is still limited by the 32-bit address space.\nIf you have a single memory hungry process you really need a larger address space, which you get through a 64-bit kernel.\n", "Q: MP3's not playing in Banshee Just installed Ubuntu 11.10 yesterday (Feb19) and I have noticed that Banshee will not play MP3's at all.\nThe Ubuntu Restricted file will not install either.....something about not being in my software sources. A few people have recommended this file to me, however, it's not available to install.\nSeems to me that it shouldn't be this difficult to get MP3's working in this age!\n\nA: I think not all of your software sources are activated. The software is organized in different sources, which are 'main', 'universe', 'restricted' and 'multiverse'. Main contains open source software, supported by Canonical. The software in universe is maintained by the community. Restricted contains proprietary drivers and in multiverse is software which is restricted by copyright or legal issues.\nIt seems, that some of this sources are not activated. To do so, go to 'System Settings' -> 'Software Sources'. In the tab 'Ubuntu Software', check all boxes, except 'Source Code' and Cdrom. \nThen you have to install the packages gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3 and*gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly* in Ubuntu Software Center\n\nA: Installing Medibuntu will solve your problem... After installing this package you will not only able to play mp3s but any media format you wish to play.(using bunshee or any other player)\nInstalling Medibuntu\nThe following bash command adds Medibuntu's repository to Ubuntu. It also adds Medibuntu's GPG key to your keyring, which is needed to authenticate the Medibuntu packages.\nThis command should be run in the Terminal (Applications â Accessories â Terminal): \n\nsudo wget --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/$(lsb_release -cs).list && sudo apt-get --quiet update && sudo apt-get --yes --quiet --allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get --quiet update\n\nMedibuntu's repository is deactivated by upgrading to a newer Ubuntu release, so you should run this command again after the release upgrade.\nYou may also wish to add the following packages. The first will cause many apps from the Medibuntu repository to appear in Ubuntu Software Center. The second will allow users to generate crash reports against Medibuntu packages and submit them to the Medibuntu bugtracker.\nsudo apt-get --yes install app-install-data-medibuntu apport-hooks-medibuntu\n\nPlease note you may have to use --force-yes instead of --yes in order for this command to succeed. \nAnother good option.\nInstead of tyrying above steps...\nJust open ubuntu sofware center and install VLC player.

You will be able to play any file format you wish to plat.\n\nA: Often all you need to do is to install lame: sudo apt-get install lame\n\nA: Regarding Banshee media player, I worked out a solution.\nIn Ubuntu 14.0.3, via Synaptic package manager, I (re)installed gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg/-fluendo-plugins-mp3-partner/-plugins-base/-plugins-good/-plugins-ugly/-pulseaudio & gstreamer1.0-fluendo-mp3/-libav/-plugins-base/-plugins-good/-plugins-ugly/-pulseaudio/-x, & everything works well, including video playback.\n", "Q: How can I remove new kernel versions after downgrading? I upgraded Ubuntu to 12.04, all packages. But after that I encountered a lot of problems so I decided to downgrade to 11.10.\nAfter I did that I found I now have two kernels: 3.2.x and 3.0.x.\nI found many explanations of how to remove older kernels, but i have no idea how to remove the newer kernel.\nI dont see a 3.2 kernel running when im using the 3.0 kernel. But I see it in Grub.\nWhen I type uname -r in terminal I see the 3.0.x kernel which im using at present.\nHow do I proceed to remove the 3.2 kernel?\n\nA: This should remove your 3.2 kernel:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge 3.2.x-xx-*\n\nObviously, replace the x's with the actual version numbers from your 3.2 kernel version.  If you don't remember what those numbers are, you should be able to see them by looking in the /boot directory.\nThe last time I did this, I recall it triggering a grub-update to remove it from the GRUB menu as well.\n-This works best for removing newer kernels that you want remove like 3.3.0 +, which would not be found in synaptic, this is a life saver! -Rabbit2190\n\nA: There are 3 files you will need to remove, more if you are using a virtual machine too. But these are the main ones.\nOpen synaptic, use the search to find the installed kernels \n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-3.2.x.x\n\n*linux-headers-3.2.x.x-generic (possibly generic-pae or i686)\n\n*linux-image-3.2.x.x\nShould be easy enough to remove. Afterward run\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: I think the second will work for you :\n1. For uninstalling the kernel run:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-version_number*\n\nsudo apt-get remove linux-headers-version_number*\n\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-extra-version_number*     (if applicable)\n\nor simply uninstall them from synaptic/software center.\n2. For uninstalling the kernel installed from source, run:\nsudo rm -rf /lib/modules/kernel_version\n\nsudo rm -f /boot/vmlinuz-kernel_version*\n\nsudo rm -f /boot/initrd.img-kernel_version*\n\nsudo rm -f /boot/config-kernel_version*\n\nsudo rm -f /boot/System.map-kernel_version*\n\nFinally, after uninstalling the kernel by either one of the processes above, run:\nsudo update-grub\nto clean the grub menu.\n", "Q: Way to disable windows from resizing while dragging but allow keyboard shortcut resizing? I'd like to be able to tap a keyboard shortcut and have a window \"snap\" to the left side of the screen. However I hate it when I'm trying to move windows around and the window keeps trying to resize from my drag actions. So I'd like to enable a keyboard shortcut to perform this function but disable this function from occurring while dragging windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way I can safely disable the drag-to-resize action? (I hear CCSM is dangerous to use so I prefer not to use it.

Like on Windows I can tap Shift+Super+Left to snap a window to the left side of the screen.\n\nA: The answer to your questions is yes (with a catch), but you have to use CCSM.\nYou can resize Windows using a shortcut key:\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% sure that you can stop Windows from resizing when you hit screen borders.\nAs for having them snap to certain edges, the \"Grid\" plugin can do just that.\n\n", "Q: Scripting question (youtube-dl and xclip) I have youtube-dl and xclip installed.\nIs there a way I could write a script that can run commands from both?\nFor example: youtube-dl -l --extract-audio (url) but instead of pasting a url could I have xclip paste what's in my clipboard with the command: xclip -o\nI am a complete noob when it comes to scripting and not even sure what I should use to write the script, as far as I can tell I should use Bash.\n\nA: You almost had the code:\nyoutube-dl -l --extract-audio \"$(xclip -o)\"\n\n$(command) executes command and $(...) is then substituted for the standard output of command.

I switched to intel by removing the vesa packages, installing libgl1-mesa-dri and libgl1-mesa-dlx along with xserver-xorg-vide-intel, and now Compiz starts but is incredibly glitchy.

I just installed Ubuntu a couple of days ago.  As far as I can tell the terminal is a huge part of any Linux distro.  My question at this point is why?  When I look up anything about it, the commands put in the terminal are all easily done through the GUI.  So, what are the advantages of using the terminal?\nEdit: Thanks for the answers everyone. After a little poking around, and with the help of your answers, I can now understand its use. I can proudly say, that for the past 3 days, I've been using it for just about everything, and I hope to soon have a better grasp on scripting.\n\nA: My favourite is less typing. How can this be I hear you ask. Well I login, reverse search or up arrow) for a command I typed last week and hit carriage return. The alternative is far more mouse clicks (and trying to remember).\nMy second favourite is it makes it easier to answer questions on stack-overflow; No screen shots needed, just text.   \n\nA: The terminal in Unix is a wonderful, powerful tool. When transitioning from the world of Windows it is hard to appreciate this because the Windows (cmd.exe) shell is rather, how do I nicely say, lacking. Most *nix default shells (bash, zsh, etc) have several advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is standardized through POSIX and the Single Unix Specification, so a script you write for one computer will likely work on all POSIX compliant machines (assuming you restrict yourself to standard commands, of which there are lots). Microsoft has a habit of including tools in some versions and not in others, making batch programming very hit or miss\n\n*Because Unix was built from the terminal up, most everything is configurable from the command line. Windows was like this up to a point, but they opted to drop the 16-bit subsystem and DOS with it. Now the GUI is the only way to change some things in Windows.\n\n*Because it is so flexible. Commands can be piped together (ls | grep filename), they can be captured (gcc program.c > ./standard_out 2> ./standard_error), and can be substituted (ls /home/`whoami` or ls /home/$(whoami))\n\n*Because UNIX utilities are designed to do one thing, and do it well. Just look into awk,grep,sed, wget or a host of others. By themselves they achieve a single task, but given #3 and #2 they can be built into powerful expressions.\n\n*Because of the ability to automate tasks. cron and bash scripts allow long, complicated, and/or repetitive tasks to either be simplified or automated completely. \n\n*Because humans are prone to error. Relatively short shell scripts can be used to change settings in a consistent manner. Safety checks can be built into the scripts, rather than relying on users to know which commands are safe to run in different circumstances.\n\nA: What about when you need to do something as \"root\"?  Logging-in via the GUI as root is a bad idea (and I don't even think Ubuntu will allow you to do so, by default).\nAlso, consider that the Linux GUI (X11) is simply a running program just like everything else.  If X11 should crash, you'll be glad you know your command-line.\n\nA: I just want to contribute with an example, that I find very useful, from the instructions for adding the PPA for VirtualBox. When you add a PPA, you should also register the public key, so GUI method:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the key with Firefox (or other browser)\n\n*open Synaptic (or other APT gui)\n\n*search for right menu item\n\n*browse for the downloaded file \n\n*finally confirm\n\n\nExplaining this in a user guide can be expensive! Instead, it can be done with a single & simple command line:\nwget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -\n\n\nA: There are a multitude of advantages to using the terminal. Arguments range from convenience, productivity to nostalgia. Here are some :\n\n\n*\n\n*There are some things that you (rather me) simply cannot accomplish using a GUI. It is not because it isn't doable, it is simply because nobody bothered to write a GUI for these commands. For example if I wanted to use some command, say mdf2iso to convert a whole bunch of files in a folder. I can pipe the output using | operator and do it in a single stroke.\n\n*For a lot of us, it is just the way things should be. Keep in mind that this has little to do with expertise. I am no linux expert, I am just a regular user, but I do prefer to use the command line wherever possible. This is not so much of an argument about why it should be used, as much as why it is used.\n\n*Scripts are a powerful thing. You can use conditions if and loops for etc.. and do all sorts of things combining the power above. There is no limit to the power of scripting. You can automate complex tasks which are tailored to your requirements. For such things, it is often hard to find a GUI app that matches your requirement.\n\n*You can perform tasks by remote login, even over very low bandwidth settings.\n\n*Helping, writing tutorials etc are much easier if you can specify the commands to the other person. This way, you do not have to take screenshots. This has another advantage for the person who is being helped as well, which brings us to the next point.\n\n*Using the command line usually gives you a better understanding of what you are doing and what is going on.\n\n*And lastly, it is simply faster. It is much quicker to type a few letters and press TAB than to click though endless menu options. You can use !mo to invoke the last command you ran that started with mo (e.g. mount) and so on.\nI am sure there are a thousand other reasons I failed mention.\n\nA: The command line works pretty well as it does in windows -remember that text entry msdos box with the black background?\nIt gives the user a means of issuing commands directly to the computer without the drain on the computer's resources that a GUI brings. It is also a way of issuing powerful commands in order to do things which can not be done via a GUI.\nI'm not knocking the usefulness of the GUI way of working but in the hands of a skilled op, the command line way can be extremely fast and efficient. In the hands of a real wizard the command line works miracles.  I've barely scratched the surface of the possibilities, learn something new every day. I'll never be a wizard -too old- but I'd like to be an average op one day...\nWelcome to Ubuntu and to Ask Ubuntu. This is a great place!!\n\nA: For a beginner, the terminal is a chore to use, but if you start learning how to use it, it becomes easier.  Once you feel comfortable with it, it gives you a feeling of confidence that you can handle things when they go wrong.\nFor example, when a gui program refuses to launch, and you have no clue as to what is wrong, you can run the command in a terminal, and often see the reason for the problem in the terminal output.  Then, you can copy some of that into a search, and find the answer, if needed.\nYou can enter a command with \"--help\", and get a list of command line options that might be useful for some special cases.\nIf something goes wrong, and the GUI won't even run at all, you can often open a virtual terminal or possibly just a command line from bootup, and fix the problem by editing a config file, or running a commandline program.\n\nA: Simply put, you have more than hundred keys that can control/talk/order the computer rather than one single mouse with two or three buttons. The more the controls you have, the faster you can be. \nFor anyone who does not know typing, an on-screen keyboard might look great. However faster you can use the mouse, you cannot type faster than you can using keyboard.\nIf you are using mouse/windows, its like the computer controlling you and dictating what you can do. When you get used to the command line world, you can feel the whole system under your control waiting for your order. You need to experience it to understand the difference.\n\nA: Eventually? Because you start scripting, and the wonderful thing about scripting is this:\nInstead of changing the way you do things, you can change the script that does them.\nYou can write scripts for the terminal, and you usually can't for graphical programs, so that's why people use the terminal. \nBut I sense a hint of \"Why should I use the terminal?\" in your question. I can't answer that for you, you being you and me being not-you, but this related question may offer you some insight:\nHow/why do people end up using being command-line users?\nI think you could identify three stages: (1) reluctant use; (2) knowing the minimum needed for comfort; (3) finding one enjoys scripting. One can get use out of the terminal at all three of these levels; find out for yourself where your curiousity stops. Also, one can pass through these stages very quickly indeed if one simply decides one wants to learn shell scripting.\n\n\n*\n\n*âI need this program, so I guess I'll use the command-line.â\nIt starts, usually, because people find that they need something specialist or \ntricky, and the program that Google/a forum/a friend \nrecommends for the turns out to be a command-line program. So, they open a \nterminal, and type what the instructions tell them to type, and this is how \nthey come to use the terminal. Examples of such programs that make you use \nthe command-line:\n\n\n*\n\n*LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt (different flavours of the same system) takes a text \nfile, and turns it into a beautiful PDF document. See this showcase for examples; I rather like âppâ and âLM-Volume-manuscriptâ.\n\n*rename is a lovely little program that lets you rename tons of files according \nto a pattern. A simple example: rename s/myfile([0-9]+).txt/$1-myfile.txt/ \nturns all files named like 'bond007.txt' into '007-bond.txt', no matter what \nthe number is.  Perhaps you want to rename some music album files, you see.\n\n*Perhaps you want to run a website from your computer, and you \ndiscover that if you want to tell the webserver to run/halt/refresh \nits configuration, you have to issue a terminal command.\n\n\nNote that there are graphical front-ends for many of these systems, but \nthat's beside the point: command-line invocation is common and traditional, \nmany HOWTOs assume this, and this is how it starts. Because:\n\n*âOkay, I'm a bit more comfortable now.â\nOnce inside the command line, people start thinking: Wouldn't it be easy \nif I could  just ..\n\n\n*\n\n*... change directories to look inside another one? (cd mydir, for 'change directory')\n\n*...  get a quick reminder of the text files in this directory? (ls *.txt, for 'list')\n\n*... move/rename a file? copy a file? delete a file? (mv myfile newname, cp myfile mycopy, and rm myfile, for 'move', 'copy', and 'remove')\n\n*... open this file for editing/viewing? (gedit myfile, or leafpad, or nano, or vim, or whatever.)\n\n\nOnce people have learned these five commands, they are essentially \ncomfortable in the command line: they can move, look, and interact. \nIt's even a bit powerful: you can operate on whole groups of files at \nonce with commands like mv iceland-*.jpg My_Iceland_Pics/, and \nisn't that cool? \nNow, a lot of people happily stop here. They know how to use the terminal, they'll use it when they need it, and that's all. This is the \"the terminal is useful\" level. People who prefer the terminal, however, usually do so because they need/want/feel they can't do without the spectacular power that scripting offers. And that usually starts like this:\n\n*âHey, a script is just some commands in a file!â\nThis realisation may lead to several further changes, depending on the person. \nMany just go 'meh', of course; there's no point in learning what you don't need. \nAnyway, things like this may happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*You start using little scripts to automate boring stuff. Some you \nwrite yourself; some you get from someone else; and eventually, \nyou start modifying other people's scripts. \n\n*You discover that a huge category of things that you used to do \nby hand, because it required thinking-in-between, can be automated \nusing these two constructs:\n\n*\n\n*if something_is_true; then step1a; step2; else step1b; fi, and  \n\n*for file in list_of_files; do process1 $file; process2 $file; step3; done\n\n\n*Faced with a boring or complex task, you find that you would rather write \na script for it than do it by hand. This is not even for time savings \nor reuseability, necessarily, but simply because it's more fun.\n\n*You start using the 'use script on source file' workflow a lot, because it fits the way you think.\n\n\n\nYou may not experience all, or even any, of these things. The more apply to you, however, the better the terminal will be for you. You'll find out for yourself how much you end up using it. Have fun!\nPost scriptum. In programming the script -> run -> result and input -> process -> output workflows are hugely common, and the terminal is spectacularly suitable for these workflows. Add to this the fact that the shell really is nothing but another programming language, and you'll see why there is such a huge overlap between command-line users and programmers. \n\nA: Another point to add: It's fun to use the command line! ;)\n(http://vladdolezal.com/blog/2008/the-real-reason-we-use-linux/)\n\nA: I was just answering a similar question like this the other day.  It turned out this person never used keyboard shortcuts to do anything, so it turned out to be a long discussion.  I hope you  have some familiarity with those...it would make my points more understandable.\nConsider using a word processor.  If you save a file, you might use a keyboard shortcut like ctrl-s.  Someone might say, \"I prefer to use the menu. It doesn't save me much time to use the shortcut.  And if you have to save a new file you have to navigate through the file system to the directory, and then type the name anyway.\"  So this objector is correct that each keyboard shortcut by itself does not save a significant amount of time.  The true savings is in chaining shortcuts together, e.g. select all, cut, paste.  Even the word processor makers have realized this and made it more convenient to access the file structure using the keyboard, e.g. being able to access recent folders/locations using tab and arrow keys.  \nOf course selecting pieces of text requires the mouse oftentimes... this is why programmers and people that do a lot of editing prefer to use a text editor that supports full keyboard use so you never have to use a mouse.  Not only is the mouse slow, but it is prone to errors -- it is particularly easy to select or delete the wrong text.\nNow what does this have to do with the command line?  An advantage of the command line is that it avoids using the slow, error-prone mouse.  Instead, you type and you do it from one location; you don't have to be looking around for another menu or clicking over there and then over here.  It's the same reason people like using web browser keyboard shortcuts (to open new tabs/windows, to use Gmail, etc.); they're going to have to type the URL (or email or whatever) in anyway...why move your hand away from the keys?\nBut most importantly, just like keyboard shortcuts are the most powerful when you start using them all together (rather than just one or two), you can chain commands together to do more powerful things that would either take forever through the GUI or you couldn't even imagine doing at all.  For example, from the command line, you can tell your web browser, I want to keep refreshing this webpage every 30 seconds, look for a certain text and when that happens, send me and a group of contacts an email saying that text has appeared on the webpage.  As another example, you can tell your computer, I want to look through ALL the emails I ever wrote, look for a reference to this particular book, produce a list of dates I've mentioned this and who to, order the list according to frequency, and put it into this email I'm typing now.  \n\nA: The CLI is fast to use when you know exactly what you want to do and how to do it. It can be much more efficient than using a gui. Also, if you want to connect remotely to your machine the CLI is far easier on a slow link. If you are comfortable with the CLI you can take advantage of scripting too.\nIf you google cli vs gui you will get tonnes of hits eg:\nhttp://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000619.htm\nYour question is not really specific to Ubuntu, linux or even pc's - you get a debate on this subject from any system that supports gui and cli, e.g. configuring Cisco routers.\n\nA: There are a number of good points made in the answers but I still have an additional point to make. Sometimes after an install or or update a GUI application won't start and leaves you without any error messages. In these cases it can be very helpful to open a terminal window and start the ap from the command line. There's almost always more information provided on the terminal than presented when starting from the GUI.\n\nA: I don't even see the point of checking off an answer lol.\nAnyhow. Terminal is like your CMD on Windows. Back in the days, before GUI appeared, people program and work under DOS mode, pretty much plain Terminal. GUI is made to make task simpler and easier, but sometimes using GUI actually requires more work.\nFor example, as a developer, if I just want to compile a C++ program, I don't have to use sophisticated IDE. IDE is a GUI interface which has many advanced features that a simple text editor does not offer. So instead of downloading a really huge IDE for a simple task, I can just write the following and it will execute my C++ program, whose executable file is called main.\ng++ -o main main.cpp\nchmod 777 main\n./main\n\nIf you do interpreter language like Python, you can enter the Python interactive shell. Yes. There are interactive shells that are wrapped in nice GUI, but it's slower and buggy (oh think of IDLE...)\nSometimes when GUI is broken, you can try to use Terminal to open it. Sometimes, some softwares in Linux don't offer good GUI or it is very difficult to find where the GUI launcher is, you just go to Terminal and type, for example:\nxpdf homework.pdf\n\nThis will open the homework.pdf for you.\nIn another situations, GUI doesn't offer enough power and magic to do your task. Some search functions are very basic, and you can't apply depth-search, or complicated search pattern. But through terminal, a command can be issued with really really complicated and long pattern.\nGUI is nice, but sometimes through commands you can make things simpler too. Sometimes you just don't have a choice: you have to use commands through terminals. \n\nA: I would add a side point that seems to not be mentioned, even if it's not a true advantage.\nThink about the fact that the GUI is like a \"panel\" that gives access to the functions that the real program has. Many software, especially if in an early version, doesn't  have a GUI, and you can run them only from the terminal. And, as others pointed out, even the applications which have a GUI, sometimes don't have interfaces for all functions; for those functions, you have to use the terminal.\n\nA: Everyone has described the advantages well, I would just like to add that apart from transparency where you get to see all the dependencies listed, its speed. After demise of synaptic from Ubuntu, the software center is just too laggy especially on slower machines, here install from terminal is way faster.\n", "Q: How do i stop Google Chrome (which is not installed) from launching?

Is there any way to fix the zero length partition, either by managing to boot into ubuntu live usb somehow or some other tool. Thanks alot!\n\nA: Sorry for taking such a long time to answer, but I was trying to fix the drive. \nIn the end I made a gparted live-usb, then ran testdisk (tutorial: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15761/recover-data-like-a-forensics-expert-using-an-ubuntu-live-cd/). I then had the infamous gparted error where the entire drive was \"unallocated\". \nAfter some looking around I found out this means that the partition table is corrupt. The partitions themselves, though, were accessible. After using testdisk a number of times in an attempt to fix the partition table, to no avail, I looked up other tutorials. \nOne of them said to do: \"fdisk /dev/sdX\", then check if the partitions it presents are correct, then write the new partition table. This also didn't work for me. \nI then found a tool called \"fixparts\" which fixes corrupt partition table. I then made sure that the partitions I wanted (were) primary or logical are correct. Unfortunately, fixparts didn't get my \"files and downloads\" partition (shared between OSs) correct. I panicked. \nI ran testdisk again, and gparted showed \"unallocated\" again.

I then ran fixparts once more.\nIn gparted I tried to fix how the partitions were supposed to be, but it didn't let me. So I had to erase my home and files partitions (in the extended) then grow the extended (there were 22 gigs of unallocated for some reason, which were part of my original files partition). I made the new home, swap and files partitions. I then had to reinstall ubuntu, and while the 300+ mb of updates downloaded (I have slow internet) I left all the files from the backup copying overnight. \nI write this post from my newly updated Ubuntu install, with all the files where they're supposed to be.

You'll need to use Gparted from the Live CD/USB, and the only disadvantage is, it's gonna take a while -hours rather then minutes. Do it on a weekend, when you don't urgently need that computer.\nThe home dir doesn't contain applications, so, in case of a clean install, applications will need to be reinstalled. That said, there is a way to save the list of all currently installed packages, which makes the job of reinstalling them less tedious.\nEdit:\nTo save the list of installed packages, run\ndpkg --get-selections > ~/Desktop/installed-software\n\nThat will create a text file with all the installed packages, back it up, you'll need it after reinstallation.\nOn the new system, place that file into your home folder, then run:\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < installed-software\nsudo apt-get -u dselect-upgrade\n\n\nA: Normally, when you install applications from the software center, they will blend in with the rest of the system. There isn't really anything quite similar to C:\\Program Files from Windows. That is changing, at least for third-party software. When you buy an application from the software center, for instance, it will be placed in its own folder in /opt. This is similar to the Program Files directory, except that it will never contain any kind of personal information.\nHowever, in a desktop system, there is never any personal information or settings stored outside your home directory. Everything personal, including all settings and data, is stored in your home directory and nowhere else. In other words, if you mount your home directory in a fresh install and then reinstall your applications, they will act as if the system was never changed at all. There is no central registry or anything like that. Everything is stored in your home. So it's very easy to do a fresh install. Just keep your home directory. The graphical installer can actually do this for you now. \nNote that I said desktop systems. If you run an email, database, web or other server software, then they'll usually have their data in /var. I only mention this for completeness. If you don't know that you've done anything like that, then you don't need to worry about it. \n", "Q: Advice on linux distros for a charity I'm doing a non profit job for my work where we are setting up Internet for the children ward at the local hospital.\nWe want a client server architecture, we have a server pc and about 7 other medium spec pc's\nWhat we are after is a completely locked down Linux distro (preferably a Ubuntu based one) which we can grant access only to Firefox, a few games, some paint programs, skype and nothing else.\nCan anyone advise on something suitable?\nWe are currently trying Edubuntu 11.10 but are having a few issues as we are new to Linux and especially new to unity.\n\nA: LTS is the way to go, so yes, Ubuntu 10.04LTS, upcoming 12.04LTS. Bear in mind charity machines are usually low specced so small distros like Puppy based on LTS Ubuntu are a very good option. Also look into Centos which has seven year support and is based on excellent Red Hat.\n\nA: One thing I can tell you, is that if you're planning to setup such a system now, and considering using Ubuntu for it, then there's absolutely no doubt that 12.04 is what you want. It's more faster, more stable and more polished than 11.10. In addition, it'll be supported for 5 years, instead of the 1.5 years of support for 11.10. \nIf your users should only be allowed to use a certain set of applications, then I'd say simply remove the other ones. Advanced Linux users will be able to use other applications anyway and I know of no way to completely disable that possibility. Often, when people ask these types of questions, there are better ways than to lock down the system. It would be easier to provide a good answer if you provided more details in your question.\n\nA: maybe one script to help you\nexample steps with cp or rsync command:\n1 - customize the environment the way you want\n2 make a full backup\nctrl+alt+f2 (exit graphic mode)\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nsudo mkdir /var/BKP (create a folder to store the backup)\ncp -Rf /home/username /var/BKP or rsync -avzp /home/username /var/BKP\n3 - script  clear/restore user folder and preferences\nnano /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99restore  (make a script)\n#!/bin/sh\nrm -rf /home/username\ncp -Rf /var/bkp/username /home or rsync -avz /var/bkp/username /home\nchown -Rf username.username /home/username\nexit 0\n\nmake executable\nchmod a+x /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99restore\n\nI use this script in gdm post session, I believe in Xsession.d work too, In lighdm I do not know.\n\nA: You could try Lubuntu, a specialized lightweight version of Ubuntu that is great for old hardware.

They were formatted as EXT4 and setup with encryption from a laptop running Ubuntu 10.04 - and I've had no problems with mounting and running rsync on my image folders to backup new files to the disks.\nI recently acquired a netbook for travel purposes, and am trying to get the drives to also work on this so I can make backups while on holiday. The netbook is running Ubuntu 11.04.\nWhen I first plugged in one of the drives, I was asked for the password, which I entered, and the disk activity light started blinking, but no file window opened as I expected. However, I did not get any error messages, either.\nWhen I opened a file window, I could see the volume listed as \"Backup Alpha\" (the disk's name) but when I tried to open it, I received the error:\nUnable to mount \"Backup Alpha\"\n\n/dev/dm-0 is mounted\n\nWhen I try to unmount the drive, by right-clicking and selecting the \"safely remove drive\" option, I get the message:\nUnable to stop 500 GB Hard Drive\n\nOne or more block devices are holding /dev/sdb\n\nOne problem I did have when initially trying to access the drive was that cryptsetup had not yet been installed on the computer, and so the first time I tried to enter a password and access the drive failed.\nI found a way to disable automount, but now I'm having problems manually mounting the drive:\n$ sudo mount /dev/sdb /media/backup -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137\nmount: unknown filesystem type 'crypto_LUKS'\n\nI found some help at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=868681 and tried:\n$ mkdir /media/backup\n$ modprobe dm-crypt\n$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb backup\n$ vgchange -ay\n$ mount /dev/(\"volume group name\") /media/backup\n\nThe problem is that vgchange doesn't output any volume groups, and I still can't mount /dev/sdb\n\nA: It seems trouble around automount feature.\nTry uncheck this option and mount/unmount drive after logout/login.\nJust due to mount/unmount of encrypted drives requires a bit more time for this operation - with automount option it can bring such little confuse.

Why?\n\n\nThe iteration time for a key-slot (see Section 5 for an explanation what iteration does) is calculated when setting a passphrase. By default it is 1 second on the machine where the passphrase is set. If you set a passphrase on a fast machine and then unlock it on a slow machine, the unlocking time can be much longer. Also take into account that up to 8 key-slots have to be tried in order to find the right one.\nIf this is problem, you can add another key-slot using the slow machine with the same\npassphrase and then remove the old key-slot. The new key-slot will have an iteration count adjusted to 1 second on the slow machine. Use luksKeyAdd and then luksKillSlot or luksRemoveKey.\nHowever, this operation will not change volume key iteration count (MK iterations in output of \"cryptsetup luksDump\"). In order to change that, you will have to backup the data in the LUKS container (i.e. your encrypted data), luksFormat on the slow machine and restore the data. Note that in the original LUKS specification this value was fixed to 10, but it is now derived from the PBKDF2 benchmark as well and set to iterations in 0.125 sec or 1000, whichever is larger. Also note that MK iterations are not very security relevant. But as each key-slot already takes 1 second, spending the additional 0.125 seconds really does not matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother LUKS tutorial:\nHOWTO: Automatically Unlock LUKS Encrypted Drives With A Keyfile\n\n", "Q: Ive installed both the graphics drivers; Is that bad?

The idea is, if no new features are introduced, there are less chances of creating (security) bugs. However, if a security issue has been discovered, patches are applied.\nThe latest PHP version as of now in 10.04 Lucid is 5.3.2-1ubuntu4.14, where 11.10 Oneiric is 5.3.6-13ubuntu3.6.

I'm constantly getting emails from root@bert (bert is my hostname).\nThe \"problem\" is that the emails might be blocked without a fully-qualified domain name because lots of anti-spam stuff relies on FQDNs to score emails' spamminess. I personally don't have any problems sending mail to myself on Gmail but you might have problems with Gmail or other providers.\nThe most professional solution would be to get a proper domain and set things up but if don't want to stretch the $10 or so, you can get a free email account with Google, Hotmail, etc. and most of them will let you send email via SMTP.

No other dates\nwould change (i.e. freezes etc.), we are just using the extra two weeks\nfor testing and possible bug fixing for identified issues.\nAccording to the schedule, there are 4 point releases to be expected within the 12.04 lifecycle. 12.04.2 is scheduled for release on 14 Feb 2013 and the last point release 12.04.4 is scheduled for January 24 2014.\n\nWhat is a Point Release?\n12.04.2 will provide users with a new kernel as well as a roll up of previous 12.04 package updates and security patches.\nGoals (as outlined in the Ubuntu Point Release Process):\n\n*\n\n*Refresh hardware support in LTS releases for carefully-selected\nhardware\n\n*Roll up accumulated stable updates into updated images to\nreduce download requirements for new deployments\n\n*Maintain stability of existing installations\n\nHow often do these updates come out?\nCurrently, the schedule for 12.04 LTS point releases looks like this:\n\n*\n\n*12.04.1 (23 August 2012)\n\n*12.04.2 (31 January 2013)\n\n*12.04.3 (15 August 2013)\n\n*12.04.4 (24 January 2014)\n\nAre there upgrades to the kernel version?\nYes. 12.04.2 will be shipping with a backported Quantal kernel according to Launchpad. See here for some additional details. (The following is speculation on my part) The current Quantal kernel is 3.5.0-18 and will move towards a 3.8 kernel as release candidates are available. I am expecting 12.04 to follow suit, but I have not sussed out all of the details just yet.\nWill the system perform better after a point release?\nI believe that is the goal. ;-)\n\nA: If you are familiar with the way Microsoft Windows manages its versions, you can relate point releases to Service packs that are released after a while when the product is released to the general consumption. \nThe basic idea for having point releases in LTS versions is to ensure that the LTS version works on newer hardware and doesn't necessary have to download a huge amount of updates when freshly installed. \nThe point release essentially contains the bug fixes the version has gone since it was released to the public, which includes security fixes, package updates, translation packs updates, etc. \nYou can read Mark Shuttleworth's blog, where he talks about the point releases of 8.04. An excerpt from his blog that is relevant:\n\nThese point releases will include support for new hardware as well as\n  rolling up all the updates published in that series to date. So a\n  fresh install of a point release will work on newer hardware and will\n  also not require a big download of additional updates.\n\n\nA: The point releases are new CD images including all the latest packages from lucid-updates and lucid-security.\nThese will support newer hardware than the original lucid CDs, and save some download time + bandwidth for updates. So, if you find yourself downloading and burning a Lucid ISO, grab the latest point release. Also, if 10.04 won't install on a new machine, try the latest point release.\nIf you already have Ubuntu 10.04 installed, the point releases probably aren't of any interest. If you install updates, you're already running everything that the latest point release provides.\n\nA: In addition to all the answers given here, I'm adding some info about how to see the milestones for the next point release so that, you can be sure whether your problem (if you have any) with your LTS release is  going to be fixed there or not. It's also helpful for tracking bugs and helping Ubuntu development by informing about existing bugs\nTo see the milestone for the next release\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Ubuntu project's page at launchpad. The url is http://launchpad.net/ubuntu \n\nThe page has links for the Ubuntu releases (which are active) and upcoming release. \ncurrent = means the current Ubuntu version. That is last released Ubuntu version. Now it is 12.04 LTS\nsupported = means the Ubuntu versions, which are still supported. That is they will be delivered security updates.\nfrozen = means the feature of the next Ubuntu release is got frozen. That is no new feature will be added and none will be removed. It is the final stage of development release.\n\n*Click on the LTS releases' next milestone. That is 12.04.2 (as of this writing). After clicking on that link you will be redirected to the page for the milestone. In that page, you will see which bugs are targeted to fix and which are already fixed or in progress of fixing. Also the importance of those bugs will be listed there.\n\nYou can then click on the bug link and participate on the bug tracking. More information on tracking bugs and reporting is in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I report a bug?\n\nA: You can see thorough description about Ubuntu 12.04 maintenance releases (applies to other version of Ubuntu) in the following link:\nUbuntu 12.04.1: LTS maintenance release\n\nA: Point releases are just the result of merging all the changes that has been made since the last point release or original release of the distribution.\nThey are the equivalent of the Service Packs of Microsoft in the Windows World\nIe : Ubuntu 12.04 went out in april 2012\nthe 12.04.1 wen out in august and had 186 fix included since 12.04 (see here : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+milestone/ubuntu-12.04.1)\nWatch out, 186 fix is not 186 patches or packages. \nOne fix is the answer to a problem witch can include more than one package.\nYou'll find more information here for precise : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise\nand for all milestones of ubuntu here : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+milestones\n\nA: Point releases are specific for LTS (Long Term Supported) versions of Ubuntu. Because these versions get 3 years of support (5 years for servers), the changes between the initial release image (10.04 for instance) and the current packages grow huge.\nTo quote https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS:\n\nFurthermore, we define the LTS to be:\n  [...]\n     Compatible with New Hardware: We will make point releases throughout the development cycle to provide functional support for new server and desktop hardware.\n\nEach point release is merely a snapshot of updated packages in the LTS version at that time which includes security updates and bug fixes.\n", "Q: kubuntu move encrypted home dir to new SSD (keep encryption) I already found how to move my encrypted home dir to new hd, but I have a comprehension question.\nSo when I installed kubuntu 11.10 I choose to have an encryption (I think there was only possible to choose if the home is encrypted, anyway I choose encryption), so my /home has the following structure:\n/home/.ecryptfs\n/home/<my_username>/.ecryptfs (only link to /home/.ecryptfs/<my_username>/.ecryptfs)\n/home/<my_username>/.Private (only link to /home/.ecryptfs/<my_username>/.Private)\n\nThis should be the solution:\nHow can i move an encrypted home directory to another partition?\nI couldn't follow up cause probably it was too old. So the point is, my new place should be a new SSD which I added to the system, formatted with ext4. What I don't understand is, is this sufficient, in order to keep my encryption, or should I do something to encrypt my new formatted SSD and then do the howto?\nThanks a lot?\n\nA: In order to keep your encryption, you simply need to ensure that all of the data that was previously in /home is copied over to your new /home.  That includes /home/$USERNAME as well as /home/.ecryptfs.\nYou don't need to encrypt your new formatted SSD.\n", "Q: How to archive with ignoring files larger than 100MB I'm trying to archive files with tar and ignoring files larger than 100MB. Is that possible? \nPS: Not have to use tar.\n\nA: Yeah there are probably a few more ways of doing this but you're probably best off with find as it's so tunable.\nfind /path/to/dir -size -100M | xargs tar cvf archive.tar\n\nor \ntar cvf archive.tar $(find /path/to/dir -size -100M)\n\nIf there are other directories in the current folder which you do not want to archive, then use:\nfind /path/to/dir -maxdepth 1 -size -100M | xargs tar cvf archive.tar\n\n\nPer the comments below, spaces can throw out some errors but in my testing they still seemed to get added to the archive when using the first method (a little strange in itself) but if you're worried, you can fix the find command to replace spaces with escaped versions.\nAs ever, there are a billion ways of doing this.\nfind /path/ -size -100M | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g' | xargs tar cvf archive.tar\n\nfind /path/ -size -100M -exec echo '\"{}\"' \\; | xargs tar cvf archive.tar\n\n\nA: Just exclude the big files like this:\ntar cf archive.tar /path/to/archive --exclude-from <(find  /path/to/archive -size +100M)\n", "Q: Autocomplete don't have effect when using environment variable My os is ubuntu 11.10. In the terminal when i input cp $HOME/ then type TAB. It will change to cp \\$HOME/ and won't give any hint about what's in this directory. \nBut in vim, it will work just as i want. I heard that vim is using zsh instead of bash.\n\nA: It's a bug: In natty, bash completion now quotes shell variable references rather than expanding them\nSee comment #7 for a workaround or this forum post: Bash auto-complete of environment variables - Comment #7\n", "Q: How do I cut dvb-streams (mpeg) easily? DVBCut doesn't run in 11.10 On Ubuntu 11.04 Natty and older I used to cut streams recorded from Me TV with DVBcut. Though this package is in official repositories I can't use it because of missing the icons on the GUI and lacking the option to add it in the context menu for mpeg-files.\n\nInstalling a (higher) ppa-version doesn't work due to dependencies.\nWhen I use Avidemux I have struggle with an audio delay.\nWhat can I do to have it as easy as before?\n\nA: I took the deb-file from another ppa. This works. Additionally I created a .desktop-file to use this app via rightclick.\nOnly problem: When starting the app i miss the icons:\n\nBut it works, though. The icons appear later.\n", "Q: Shut down after YouTube upload is finished I upload youtube videos over night using a computer running Ubuntu 11.10 as it really eats my bandwidth. But it's normally done when I'm not around, so it wastes quite a bit of energy leaving it running. Is there any way for me to make it shut down after it's finished?\n\nA: Instead of using a browser, you can have a look at uploading via a script - you can then create another script which invokes the Youtube Uploader script and then calls the \nsudo shutdown -h now\n\ncommand.\n", "Q: How do I create stand alone packages from ubuntu repository Is it possible to create a stand alone deb packages by merging dependancies without manual repacking.??\nI've looked at this question but it doesn't really answer what I'm trying to achieve above.\nif possible how to do it?\nupdate 1\nNo tools available yet(?)\nSo what about creating new deb package containing all packages which will copy dependencies to the cache  and executing main package.\nIs it possible?\nupdate 2\nAbove method appears to be impossible because dpkg cant handle more than one operation at a time. Some scripts may can do it\nupdate 3\nthis  tool is very helpful but it currently wont support oneric and above\nstill waiting for more generic tool\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Use super deb creator. You can make stand alone packages for upto Ubuntu 11.04.\nFor more details check the official website.\nhttp://hacktolive.org/wiki/SuperDeb_Creator\n\nA: No.  If you want a single package without dependencies, you will need to repackage it yourself.\nTo understand how packages work you can read the debian packaging guide.\n\nA: If all of these things are already in the Ubuntu archive, then all you really want is a meta package that causes their installation, right?\nYou really just need to create a nearly empty package with dh_make. Tell it you want a single binary, and a native package. In an empty directory:\ndh_make --native --indep --packagename --defaultless your-thing\n\nThen edit debian/control, and in the binary package section (the second one) Add all the packages you want installed to the Depends: section, separated by commas.\nThen build the package with\ndebuild binary\n\nIf you'd like to upload it to a PPA on Launchpad so others can easily get it:\ndch --release --distribution oneiric\ndebuild -S\n\nOf course, change oneiric to whatever you wish to package this for. Then in the directory above you should have\nyour-thing_1.0_source.changes\n\nAfter you've created a PPA just do\ndput ppa:yourusername/ppaname your-thin_1.0_source.changes\n\nAnd then anybody who installs that package will also download and install all of the other bits depended on.\n\nA: If I was going to have a hack at this, I'd do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and extract all the packages\n\n*Keep the main package's copy of the DEBIAN folder, put the others' to one side\n\n*Alter the DEBIAN/control file so\n\n*\n\n*List each package you're providing in the Provides line\n\n*Add Conflicts entries for the packages you're replacing\n\n*Remove the dependencies from the Dependencies line\n\n\n*Alter the postinst and preinst, prerm and postrm scripts so your new copy handles things for all the packages. This isn't simple because you'll need to understand what each package is doing at each step.\n\n*Repackage the whole thing back up again so you have all the files and  the new DEBIAN files.\n\n\nAt the end you should be left with something you can install but it's not great. You're going to have to manually repeat those steps any time one of the original packages gets an update.\nThe systems that keep their original packaging systems are much better. You'd even be better just shipping separate debs around. It'll take less time and will be more robust.\n\nA: Of course it's possible, but I'm not aware of any tools that will do it for you. So manual repackaging is the way to go.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I have not tried this, this is just my sketch of a solution. \nYou could perhaps download all the dependencies to a directory, make it into a debian repository, make an ISO image of the repository, and then distribute the ISO.\nYou would then mount the ISO as a loopback device, and instruct apt to use the mounted directory as a source of packages -- just like you can use your Ubuntu installation disc as a repository. \nSeems like an awful lot of work, though, but you would wind up with a single redistributable file that contains all dependencies without requiring you to repackage the deb files. \n\nA: if they don't have 'good' connectivity, but still some, you can share the files /var/cache/apt/archives directory, which will be used instead of redownloading the file.\nThis method doesn't solve the problem of how to synchronize the repository index though.\n", "Q: How to split 7.1 soundcard outputs to 4 stereo outs with ALSA I have a Xonar DX (CMI8788 driver) 7.1 surround sound card installed on my Ubuntu 11.10 system. \nI want to use the outputs of the card as 4 separate stereo outputs and I am struggling with ALSA to get it to work.\nThis is my asound.conf:\n#/etc/asound.conf\npcm_slave.eightchannels {\n        pcm \"hw:0,0\"            # or \"hw:1,0\" for the second card\n        channels 8\n}\npcm.stereo1 {\n        type plug\n        slave.pcm {\n                type dshare\n                ipc_key 87882222\n                slave eightchannels\n                bindings [ 2 3 ]\n        }\n}\npcm.stereo2 {\n        type plug\n        slave.pcm {\n                type dshare\n                ipc_key 87882222\n                slave eightchannels\n                bindings [ 4 5 ]\n        }\n}\npcm.stereo3 {\n        type plug\n        slave.pcm {\n                type dshare\n                ipc_key 87882222\n                slave eightchannels\n                bindings [ 6 7 ]\n        }\n}\npcm.stereo4 {\n        type plug\n        slave.pcm {\n                type dshare\n                ipc_key 87882222\n                slave eightchannels\n                bindings [ 0 1 ]\n        }\n}\n\nThis is my aplay -l output:\n$ aplay -l\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: DX [Xonar DX], device 0: Multichannel [Multichannel]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: DX [Xonar DX], device 1: Digital [Digital]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC662 rev1 Analog [ALC662 rev1 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: Intel [HDA Intel], device 1: ALC662 rev1 Digital [ALC662 rev1 Digital]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nThis is my aplay -L output: http://pastebin.com/MYvxFvVr\nThe system seems to completely ignore my configuration.

But there remained no difference. Notice that CPU usage was a bit strange here. It showed no high activity, but as soon as I would click on applications in gnome panel, it would shoot CPU usage to 70, or 80 or 90 or 143% etc. depending on how quickly i clicked back and forth. At this instance I removed by AC adapter of my laptop, and suddenly system got fine. So i again clicked on gnome panel, and noticed that it now took only 7% or 12% or 13% at max, with same kind of clicks in application menu.\nObservation 2: At the other times, with AC adapter plugged in, top indicates four instances of chromium taking 90%, 60%, 47% and 2% (for example), and then once I take out the AC adapter same processes take lesser CPU all of a sudden\nIntermediate conclusions: What does this indicate ? I cannot figure out any \"other\" process in \"top\" that is suddenly being triggered, its the same process that hogs up my CPU once AC power is plugged in !\nNOTE: the problem is now CONFIRMED, as i can repeat that when I have power adapter plugged in !\nCan anyone tell me what exactly does this indicate ? What is wrong, is it some bug with power management or what ?\n\nA: Most likely there is some program that runs when AC is plugged in which is taking too much CPU.\nThe best way to determine the cause is to use the terminal and one of the tools top, atop, or htop. If you understand processes, then what these tools show you will probably make sense; even so, these tools will show you the most CPU-intensive processes at the top when you run them with no switches or options.\nIf you are new to the command-line, here is a description of what to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the terminal application.\n\n*When you get a display, run the following command string: sudo top (or sudo atop or sudo htop)\n\n*Look at the list of processes and see what the top ones are.\n\n\nThe top processes will be taking all of the CPU when your problem arises.\n", "Q: TouchPad doesn't work on Ubuntu 11.10, Toshiba Salellite L500-1WP TouchPad stopped working about two weeks ago.

Examples:\n% aptitude show libc-bin\nPackage: libc-bin                        \nEssential: yes\nNew: yes\nState: installed\nAutomatically installed: no\nVersion: 2.13-20ubuntu5\nPriority: required\nSection: libs\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>\nUncompressed Size: 3,420 k\nConflicts: libc-bin\nBreaks: libc0.1 (< 2.10), libc0.1 (< 2.10), libc0.3 (< 2.10), libc0.3 (< 2.10), libc6 (< 2.10), libc6 (< 2.10), libc6.1 (< 2.10), libc6.1 (< 2.10)\nReplaces: libc0.1, libc0.1, libc0.3, libc0.3, libc6, libc6, libc6.1, libc6.1\nProvides: libc-bin\nProvided by: libc-bin\nDescription: Embedded GNU C Library: Binaries\n\nSee the Conflicts: libc-bin line?\nOne more:\n% aptitude show qdbus   \nPackage: qdbus                           \nNew: yes\nState: installed\nAutomatically installed: no\nVersion: 4:4.7.4-0ubuntu8.1\nPriority: optional\nSection: libs\nMaintainer: Kubuntu Developers <kubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com>\nUncompressed Size: 213 k\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.3.4), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1), libqt4-dbus (= 4:4.7.4-0ubuntu8.1), libqt4-xml (= 4:4.7.4-0ubuntu8.1), libqtcore4 (= 4:4.7.4-0ubuntu8.1), libstdc++6 (>= 4.1.1)\nConflicts: qdbus\nBreaks: libqt4-dbus (< 4:4.7.3-4ubuntu5), libqt4-dbus (< 4:4.7.3-4ubuntu5), qt4-dev-tools (< 4:4.7.3-4ubuntu6), qt4-dev-tools (< 4:4.7.3-4ubuntu6)\nReplaces: libqt4-dbus (< 4:4.7.3-4ubuntu5), libqt4-dbus (< 4:4.7.3-4ubuntu5), qt4-dev-tools (< 4:4.7.3-4ubuntu6), qt4-dev-tools (< 4:4.7.3-4ubuntu6)\nProvides: qdbus\nProvided by: qdbus\nDescription: Qt 4 Dbus Tool\n\nThe same \"conflicts with itself\" feature.\nI've resolved my troubles with the package manager now, but the question still bothers me: what does it mean when a package conflicts on itself?

Some packages cannot be installed simultaneously (like libc6:i386 and libc6:amd64). aptitude cannot handle these cases and therefore thinks that it may be a good idea to remove those packages. It's recommended to use apt-get now.\nIf you use apt-cache show libc-bin, you can see the line mentioning this conflict:\n\nMulti-Arch: foreign\n\nA description of this field can be found at http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Implementation#Multi-Arch:_foreign_support_packages\n", "Q: I lost my shutdown sound I lost both my startup and shutdown sounds.

Nothing you are looking to do sounds unreasonable.  Keep in mind, the VM will only be available externally when both the windows 7 and the ubuntu vm are running.  When you run a VM, both the Host (windows 7 in your case) and the Guest OS (the ubuntu) need to run simultaneously.  This means you will have to have enough CPU to run both and RAM memory (probably need at least 2GB for both to be comfortable).\nFor the VM, I recommend you try VirtualBox to host the VM.  It is free for individual use.  Get it here: https://www.virtualbox.org/\nInstall the virtualbox software on your windows 7.  Then you will need to download the ISO for the ubuntu that you would like to use.  Basically, you will need to go into virtualbox and start a new VM.  Choose linux + ubuntu for the type of guest and then you need to set your ISO to mount as a CD drive.  Start the VM and install Ubuntu. Plenty of tutorials are out there on that.  \nFor the non-static ip issue, you could try DynDns.  They associate a subdomain of one of their domains with your server.  Then you run a small daemon on the ubuntu that periodically updates Dyndns with your current IP address. Then when someone accesses you dyndns address, they get sent to your server.  I have used it successfully for a number of years now. I think they let you set up a few subdomains on a free account.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: No sound after Lubuntu installation. My hardware is pretty new; I've installed Lubuntu 11.10 and there's no sound nor volume icon in tray. The sound works well in Ubuntu. What can I do about it? I have two sound cards in this laptop, and one of them is HDMI, maybe the problem is because of that? Please help me?! Thanks.\n\nA: Lubuntu unlike Ubuntu does not make use of Pulseaudio.  Instead it uses Alsa for sound.\nThus, it is likely you need to look at alsamixer or its gui alsamixgui to control which sound elements are enable or disabled.\nYou may also need to look at using alsamixer as a startup application with the syntax similar to \namixer -c 1 sset \"PCM Capture Source\" \"Line\" - obviously you need to change the values to your sound source and output type.\nAlso - look to see if you have two sound cards - if you have, sometimes swapping the cards works:\nsudo su\ncd /usr/share/alsa \ncp -p alsa.conf alsa.conf.dist \nsed -i 's/card 0/card 1/g' alsa.conf\n\nI answered a LXDE sound-preferences question a while back which you may find useful.  \nAs indicated in that answer, you could also install pulseaudio and use pavucontrol to control your pulseaudio setup.\nAs to a LXDE friendly volume control, my answer here is an accepted method you can try.\n\nA: I finally got sound working on HDMI. It was very interesting find though.\nI saw differences in Pavucontrol without a video playing and with a video playing..\nAll i had to do was open Pavucontrol with a video playing and then select output to HDMI card.\nHope this helps all..\n\nA: This is what I did to fix the issue:\n\nLubuntu shares many components with XFCE.

This question is a duplicate of\nIntel HD Graphics card not recognized in System Info\nIn response to the ACPI tweak proposed, it's important to understand what you're actually doing to achieve \"brightness controls\" for your Linux desktop and what the cost is. There's this thing called ACPI, it's like perl for HW control, actual code is kept in your BIOS and then executed on demand by the OS (it has an interpreter). This code will change depending on the OS you're running, or in your case, the OS name you changed it to. These tables describe everything from how to clock your CPUS, to suspend/resume, thermal regulation, multiple displays (the external display button), and of course, hotkeys like brightness.\nWhen you change the acpi_os name, you're literally changing the way all of your HW will behave at runtime. My thermal remark is a worse case scenario, and is indeed possible, as by specifying Linux as the ACPI name, you're literally running untested or poorly tested code, that's telling these very low level resources what to do.\nSo if you want to continue with this shortcut then it's your responsibility to ensure the machine is operating within reasonable tolerances. That especially means thermal, going down this road can be an all or nothing thing where the fans are on full blast or to the bare minimum. You also need to double check all the other runtime features, like can it even suspend and resume anymore? volume control? Super Key? All that stuff depends on ACPI.\nSo the way Linux works is it impersonates the latest version Windows, like Windows 2009. Think about it, when you specify Linux, what version is that? There isn't one, so the next time you update your kernel, the behavior of \"Linux\" ACPI name could change and you're stuck with the side effects. People take this for granted, Windows releases are explictly versioned, the kernel+acpi runtime is all under one benchmark. Linux just rolls it forward, sure there's an ACPI version, but no vendor codes to it (yet).\nWell, how does that help you? You want brightness controls after all and all this technical background isn't really solving your problem, it is however framing the risks involved.\nCanonical has developed a test suite that excels at drilling into the firmware and testing for correctness. We can then use this information to fix the problem at it's source and get you updated firmware.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/fwts\nRunning this and submitting a bug, without those hacks enabled, will put us into a position to solve the problem. We might be able to enable just brightness controls through a platform quirk.\nThe other thing you have to consider is your hardware might not even be ready to run Windows 2009. What's the little sticker on the laptop say for \"Windows Certified\"? You can tell Linux to impersonate an earlier version of Windows, like Vista or XP. It could be that there's a bug in your ACPI table, Linux asked for Windows 2009, it wasn't there, the code was bad so it just bailed out and nothing was configured. If you instead changed acpi_osi='Windows\\ 2006' (e.g. Vista), it might all work. Even better, your laptop was probably certified for that OS so we know all that code works.\nHere's a table of all the names Linux impersonates, start from the end and roll back until you find one that works. I believe we defaulted to Windows 2009 when 2.6.38 was released: http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v3.2.7/drivers/acpi/acpica/utosi.c\n\n/*\n * Strings supported by the _OSI predefined control method (which is\n * implemented internally within this module.)\n *\n * March 2009: Removed \"Linux\" as this host no longer wants to respond true\n * for this string.

I should start out by saying that i'm fairly new to Ubuntu. Well I googled and read guides and tutorials and no matter what I kept running into issues all over the place. I'm way too frustrated and ready to quit. Is there something that's easy to setup that can backup my server, backup network shares(windows server 2003) and also help me backup windows desktop clients. Hopefully something that use ubuntu specifically on it's installation guide. For now I setup scripts to backup the shares and stuff on the server, but I would really love to be able to get everything in a single place and be able to backup windows clients.\n\nA: BackupPC is pretty simple to set up. If you know how to share the folder you want backed up as a network share, setting up BackupPC is trivial.\nYou can also use rsync or ssh to back up remote machines, and tar to back up the server but if they are Windows PCs using network shares is easiest.\nThe only thing I found hard to understand is that BackupPC is intelligent about backing up machines. \nAt first it appears that it backs them up more or less when it wants to, you set targets like you want daily backups and do them after 6pm, but it allows for machines being turned off, so if it attempts a backup which it fails as the PC is off, it will try again later. Once you get it, it is actually pretty handy thing to have though.\nYou get emails letting you know if a machine has been off for a while and backups are old.\nAnd it uses hardlinks on the server which means it doesn't have to store the same file more than once.\n", "Q: Right clicking a file, Can't delete files/folders, no option to delete.

However that wouldn't be a very helpful answer. So:\nUsing the guided partitioning is fine for use a desktop PC. This will put everything into one partition so you wont exhaust disk space on a partition unless you run out of disk space.\nI prefer to put /home onto its own partition so you can replace the OS without having to restore you home directory. In that scenario give / (root) partition 10GB so you wont have to worry about a shortage of disk space for installing applications.\nFor a file server, backup server for a small office, where you have multiple users, a similar setup is fine, although I would put backups into /home/backup/ on it's own disk.\nWeb servers with databases, or mail servers should have a separate /tmp directory, the size can vary but something like 3GB is usually adequate. Having a separate /tmp directory allows you to mount it with noexec for a bit of extra security. It also stops runaway mail queues or database queries from using the entire disk space as there is a hard limit as files cannot grow bigger than that partition.\nFor server, you generally don't have GUI applications, so / (root) partition can be 3GB.\nYou should also have a separate /var/ directory for servers to prevent log files, spool files etc growing too large and consuming all disk space. I suggest around 5GB is reasonable.\nIf you need a separate /boot partition, 100MB is adequate.\nYou can use LVM to give you the ability to resize partitions later.\nIn conclusion it depends entirely on what you will use the machine for, if in doubt put it all in one partition. If you cannot afford downtime, use LVM so you can resize later.\n", "Q: Internet very slow in Ubuntu I have ubuntu 11.04 as the os, both surfing the net and downloading stuff is a pain, it is really slow.

Disable your wireless hardware for a few seconds (my method is function key F2), turn it back on and test your browser's speed.\nI figured out that there was nothing wrong with the wireless or the Internet itself because only browsers were slow at going to websites (Chrome, Firefox, etc). But when I tried my virtual box machines, they were lightening fast on the Internet. \n\nA: This link was useful for me..\nhttp://www.hitxp.com/articles/software/ubuntu-fix-slow-wireless-internet-connection-speed-upgrading-11-04-natty-narwhal/\n\nA: For the cases about Ubuntu 11.04 and up here are some of the steps to find out what is wrong. We will assume the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are using a wired connection (Not wirelessly. This will avoid other problems).\n\n*You have already tested the connection using, either another Distro, an older version of Ubuntu or Windows. When testing the speed it was much better than when using Ubuntu 11.04+. So we assume that the problem is ONLY on Ubuntu 11.04+. If the problem is the same in Windows or with another Os/Distro then this is not an Ubuntu problem so much as a network problem. Maybe your ISP, Router, ADSL connection, etc..\n\n*You installed the default Ubuntu using the LiveCD and not Wubi from inside Windows. There has been several cases where installing Ubuntu via Wubi somehow slowed the network speed. I can only confirm for myself 1 case but I have heard of several. So I will assume you have installed Ubuntu using the LiveCD (Does not matter if you are sharing the hard drive with another distro or with Windows, the important part here is installing Ubuntu using the LiveCD).\n\n*You have updated your Ubuntu version to the latest. I recommend activating the multiverse, universe and restricted repos and also activate the proposed and backports updates. All of which can be done using the software sources.\n\n*Optional - You have installed Ubuntu from Scratch and not updated from an older version. In the past i have trouble after upgrading from a previous one. Do not know right now but this is \"just in case\".\n\n*You have already rebooted the PC at least once after installing ALL the updates.\n\n*You do not have a Firewall that limits anything. Just in case you have a pro-windows firewall device.\n\n\nSo now we can begin...\nIn each case I will give an answer that works for some but not for others. If one works, do not test the rest. We will also open several files with the terminal tool NANO. After editing or changing anything with it, to exit and save just press CTRL+X and then press Y. That should quit nano and tell it to save the file.\nThe IPv6 Issue\nThere has been some issues with having IPv6 for some users. For this let us go step by step with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check to see if IPv6 is ENABLED - Type the following in a terminal: lsmod | grep ipv6. If you see anything mentioning IPv6, then you have it enabled. If not then you can proceed with the next issue mentioned.\n\n*Disable IPv6 - There are several ways to accomplish this (Do only one):\n2.1 - Edit the file sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf and add the following lines at the end of the file:  \nnet.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 0\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1 \nSave and reboot.\n2.2 - Edit the file sudo nano /etc/default/grub and find the line that says GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" and add to it ipv6.disable=1.\nIt should look like this afterwards: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash ipv6.disable=1\". Save it and type sudo update-grub. After this reboot the PC.\n2.3 - Edit the file sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and at the end add the line: blacklist ipv6. Save and reboot.\n2.4 - Via the GUI version of NetworkManager in the Upper Panel (The network icon that appears when you install Ubuntu in the upper right corner next to the volume icon) select the network icon and select Edit Settings. Select the network connection you are using and in the IPv6 Settings select Ignore. This option can be mixed with the 3 previous mentioned above.\nConfiguration Issue\n\n\n*\n\n*In some cases it may be some misconfiguration gone wild. Try this:\n1.1 - Type ifconfig and look for the txqueuelen option. Normally it says 1000. Lower it to 500, 200, 100 or 50 just to test if it gets better: sudo ifconfig eth0 txqueuelen 50. In this case we have set txqueuelen to 50. To go back to 1000 just change the 50 to 1000.\n1.2 - Edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf and add at the end: net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=0 to the file. Save and reboot.\nNetwork Card Issues\nIn some cases the actual network card is the problem. Maybe a confusion between the drivers and the NIC or the actual NIC. In any case here are some examples depending on the network card:\n1. Realtek 8166 - Slow wired internet connection on Realtek RTL8168-8111 (Rev 6) \n2. Broadcom BCM5721 - Slow Internet connection with 11.04 \n3. e1000e 82579V - Ubuntu 11.04 and slow internet experience\nAskubuntu Issues\nIf all else fails Askubuntu has an exaggerating amount of info about \"Slow Internet\". Mose cases are 11.04 and 11.10. All of which you can see here: https://askubuntu.com/search?q=slow+internet\n\nA: Possibly that you have a tool called wondershaper that is currently configured to limit your ethernet interface bandwidth.\n\nIf this is the case, you can remove this limitation by executing sudo wondershaper clear <interface name> where interface name is something like eth0.\n\nA: It looks like the issue for this user has been solved, but I recently went through the same problems and thought that it would be helpful if I shared how I fixed it. \nSymptoms: \n\n\n*\n\n*Incredibly slow internet speed. (Capping at maybe 50 kbps)\n\n*Perfectly fine internet speed on the Windows 7 installation I am dual-booting with on the same machine.\n\n*RTL8101E/RTL8102E Ethernet Controller (Network Card)\n\n*\n\n*Note: This may still work for you if that is not your specific Realtek card.\n\n\n\nI tried reconfiguring, disabling IPV6, etc ... didn't worked.\nI did some reading and found that the Realtek LAN network driver that ships with ubuntu 12.10 (and lower if I recall correctly) is RTL8169. For whatever reason (I am not an expert) the RTL8169 driver does not work correctly with Ubuntu on some installations.\nThe first thing I recommend that you do is run the following in the terminal:\n    sudo lshw\n\nThat will give you a long list of the hardware and software specifications of your machine. You are looking for some lines that will look something like this:\n    *-network\n        description: Ethernet Interface\n        product: [The name of your network card] (Mine is RTL8101E/RTL8102E)\n        ... \n        ...\n        ...\n        configuration: ... ... driver: r8169\n\nIf the driver happens to say r8169, that is most likely the problem. What we are going to do from here is 'dowgrade' the driver to one that is more compatible with ubuntu.\nNote: As I said, the specific card I have is the RTL8101. The steps may change slightly if you have a different card.\nThe driver for the RTL8101 card can be found here.\nYou can do a simple Google search if that is not the driver you need.\nUnpack the downloaded file and extract to some place you can conveniently 'cd' to in the terminal. I chose Desktop.\nYou should now have a folder on your desktop called 'r8101-1.023.00' or similar.\nOpen the folder and confirm that there is a file called 'autorun.sh' in the folder. If there is not, you will need to read the README inside of the folder to figure out how to manually install the driver.\nOtherwise (if there is an 'autorun.sh' in the folder), open the Terminal. Then change directory to the extracted folder.\ne.g.\n    cd ~/Desktop/r8101-1.023.00\n\nRun the following command:\n    sudo ./autorun.sh\n\nThat should backup and remove your current RTL driver and install the newly downloaded driver.\nThat's it.\nThose are the steps that I took to fix the problem on my machine. Best of luck.\n\nA: If you ran a packet capture while you browse slow website, you should see AAAA DNS queries that never answer and hang.\nOne thing in Firefox is the ocsp feature. When you browse a SSL website it will start to query the ocsp. The problem is ocsp is not ipv6 yet... at least not in the options configure by default in firefox.\nI guess someone could dig the internet and add an ocsp that is ipv6 enabled.\nSo to prove that and see if it's your issue, you can go to tools -> options -> Advanced -> encryption (tab), then click on validation button and uncheck 'use the...'\nAlso, you could add yourself a ocsp. I didn't try it so far, but if I find an ipv6 ocsp I will share it here.\n", "Q: How to recover lost partitions data?

If you want to change that you can do so by\nsudo visudo\n\ntimestamp_timeout=X\nwhere X is the timeout expiration in minutes. If you specify 0 you will always be asked the password. If you specify a negative value, the timeout will never expire. E.g. Defaults env_reset,timestamp_timeout=5\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â RootSudoTimeout\n\nA: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Change sudo timeout\nsudo visudo\n\nA text document will open up in the terminal.Navigate to the bottom of the document using your arrows on your keyboard.\nDefaults timestamp_timeout=-1\n\nThen press âctrl+xâ and then press âyâ and to finish press enter.\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â NOTE\nIf you put a â-1â³ value, youâll have an unlimited sudo timeout. This isnât very wise to do for normal users.\nIncreasing the value to 10, will give you a 10 minutes sudo timeout.\n\nA: I'm wondering if the space around the , mark is your problem. I've not seen a sudoers file working with that type of syntax. Perhaps try removing the space before and after the , in the sudoers file and see if that doesn't help.\nYou could also try a user specific setting of Defaults:moonwalker timestamp_timeout=20 to apply it to just your user account allowing you to skip that line and any potential syntax issues with it.\n", "Q: How do I add HPLIP version 3.12.2 to my repository? I've an HP Officejet Pro 8500A Plus 910g all in one wireless printer. I've downloaded from HPLIP version 3.12.2 which supports this model running under Ubuntu 11.10 - 32bit version on one machine and the 64bit version on another (both home-user Dell laptops). The result is terrific - a vast improvement over the 3.11.7 version available from Ubuntu Software Center. \nHow can I get version 3.12.2 correctly installed into Software Center (or Synaptic Package Manager) ?\nWhat is the PPA for HPLIP(or where can I search for it) so that updates can be received automatically without me having to \"re-invent the wheel\" when a new OS distribution is released ?\nThanks.\n\nA: There is a PPA on launchpad but from the package contents it has not been updated for sometime (it is older than the version you have manually installed) - it currently only contains a package for Lucid/Maverick and Natty.  It might be worth contacting the maintainer to see if he intends to update this for oneiric.\nAn alternative Debian package could be from Debian themselves.\nHowever, remember, whilst Debian and Ubuntu share the same format, it is not always guaranteed that a package from debian will always install successfully on ubuntu due to possible differences in the packaging mechanism.\nAs such - if you are upgrading you will often get the latest version (at the time) of the feature freeze.  Indeed - for Precise, the 3.12.2 will be installed when you upgrade.\nAs such - if you have a good stable system - stick with either the version in the distro, or the latest from HP themselves.  You would rarely need to continually upgrade printer drivers during the distro-cycle itself.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which is the best way to install new hplip versions?\n\nA: Another method is to create your own packages from the newer upstream sources; this is called \"backporting\", and I know that hplip-3.12.2 will backport onto two-year old Debian Squeeze (roughly equivalent to Lucid) as long as the pyppd packages are also backported.  You should already have pyppd available in Ubuntu.  HPLIP does not take very long to compile, nothing like Chromium or Firefox!  \nI use this method:  https://sites.google.com/site/stevosfilehideaway/Home/backports.txt\nIn effect, you're doing what a PPA maintainer would do, only locally.\n", "Q: Sound not even on playback Why is the sound volume not consistent. some videos on youtube play loud some too quiet. Same thing with pithos. \n\nA: They have different recorded at volumes.  The only way I know to fix this is to use something like VLC's volume normalization, which is not desirable for many people in many instances.\n", "Q: Backup Logs Before Installing Updates So I ran into some issues booting my machine recently. Apparently after an update is when the chaos started.\nI was told to backup log files but I am unsure how to back them up. Is there anyway to automate that process?\n\nA: If you want to use periodic or scheduled backups I would recommend luckybackup. It is the front-end GUI to rsync. This allows you to choose WHAT and WHEN to backup. It can also run unattended. \nsudo apt-get install luckybackup\n\nIf you do here is the download page http://luckybackup.sourceforge.net/download.html\nLog files are usually located in the /var/log/\nYou can also install a log viewer\nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-log\n\nThis will allow you to view those files without having to use the terminal. \n"]
