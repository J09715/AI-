["Q: Ubuntu 13.04 won't boot past splash screen after installing graphics driver I've been running Ubuntu 13.04 for a while now, and everything has been running fine, but now it won't boot past the splash screen. I was using it, shut it down, and when I turned it back on, it would go from the splash screen to a black screen with a cursor at the top left. I ran the boot repair program on the recommended settings and it still doesn't boot after restart. \n\nA: The problem was with the graphics drivers I downloaded.

I am finding that so many so called \"experts\" here provide all sorts of code in order to fix this problem in the terminal, however, when i follow those commands in the terminal i seem to do more harm than good to my ubuntu instillation and the wordpress problem is not being resolved (and it also seems a lot of others encounter similar issues).\nQuestion\nhow i can bulk change directory, folder and file permissions in Ubuntu using the GUI. (It can be done quite easily in windows GUI surely Ubuntu has a similar option) \n\nA: \nhow i can bulk change directory, folder and file permissions in Ubuntu using the GUI.\n\nWhat you want to do is a admin task so you need nautilus in administration mode.

Any idea about what is the cause?\n\nA: Where does the error show? \nSo the basic question here is; I cannot install Ubuntu. Firstly, perhaps think of installing 13.04 as the latest version, unless you're definitely after that LTS feel. I am making the assumption this is a desktop PC. The specs are correct for this? You're not using a 64BIT for a 32BIT machine?\nPlease make sure the download is correct: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nI think this chat forum will be more useful than me however, so enjoy the link!http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1980567 \n", "Q: How to replace avconv with (the real) ffmpeg and have it work right? UPDATE (original text preserved below)\nWith the real ffmpeg about to return (in 15.04), Jon Severinsson's PPA no longer working (for ffmpeg), and both avconv-ffmpeg (now called \"libav\") and the real ffmpeg (now back to just \"ffmpeg\") dropped from interim releases, the question has become: How to most easily install ffmpeg in pre-2015 distros?\n/UPDATE\nAnyone know how to install the real, current ffmpeg (not the older version by avconv that comes w/ Ubuntu) without having the problems mentioned here?\nReasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Everything works (or so many have written),\n\n*Use the new syntax, and\n\n*After some research -- and without getting into the controversy -- I\nsimply believe the packagers made a mistake going with avconv. This is a fix.\n\n\nApparently it's not as easy as it should be due to versioning conflicts, and that avconv and ffmpeg can't coexist on the same machine (noted in the accepted answer of the above-linked post). Though at least one guide mentions installing ffmpeg locally (~) to achieve coexistence.\nMy release is Precise 12.04.3 LTS, but it appears this would apply to newer ones also.\n\nA: I have had no problem using the static build provided by the FFmpeg project. \nThere are links in http://ffmpeg.org/download.html\nDownload the version/build you need (either 32 or 64 bit), then put the executable in your $PATH (for example, ~/bin). If it is placed in ~/bin you can log out then log back in, or just run . ~/.profile, for your shell to recognize that it is in the $PATH. Now you can just enter ffmpeg and the new static build will be used.\nFor example: \n% wget http://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-64bit-static.tar.xz\n% tar xJvf ffmpeg-git-64bit-static.tar.xz\n% cd ffmpeg-git-20150427-32bit-static\n% ./ffmpeg\nffmpeg version N-45164-g46778ab- http://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/ Copyright (c) 2000-2015 the FFmpeg developers\n  built with gcc 4.9.2 (Debian 4.9.2-10)\n[...]\n\nBeing completely static should have no problem with various Linux versions (to a limit, the kernel should be not too old). \n\nA: Updated Answer for Pre-2015 Releases\nBecause no one is maintaining an all-inclusive ppa like Jon Severinsson's, Rmano's method of using a static build is now easiest. Note updates have to be checked and done manually.\n\n\n*\n\n*After heading to the official ffmpeg download page, click the\nlink under Linux Static Builds. (The target may change so it's not\nlinked directly here.)\n\n*Click the appropriate (32- or 64-bit) and\ndesired (snapshot or numbered) release to download. (Snapshot is recommended.)\n\n*If the libav version of ffmpeg was installed, remove it. The two can not reside on the same machine. If libav was not previously installed, skip to 4.  \nsudo apt-get remove ffmpeg  \nsudo apt-get purge libav-tools  \n# *Ignore any autoremove message that may appear.*\n\n\n*Extract the files (and two directories) as follows:  \n\n\n*\n\n*For single-user systems: to $HOME/bin\n\n*For multi-user setups: to /usr/local/bin\n\n\n\nStatic build install is done and ffmpeg is ready to use.\nTo update: Upon checking and finding a newer release, the install folder can be sorted by date and the existing version files quickly identified and deleted. (The timestamps will all be the same as the ffmpeg binary.) The update can then be downloaded and extracted the same as the earlier release.\nShould a comprehensive ffmpeg repo re-emerge, it would install as before:\n# Replace avconv with the real ffmpeg\n#   www.askubuntu.com/a/373509/165265\n#\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:<name of ppa here>\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nWith the real ffmpeg returning to 2015 releases and beyond, the need for this work-around will eventually fade away.\nMuch gratitude to the community for the help.\n\nA: Running 18.04, using Video Download Helper extension to FireFox.

I have downloaded youtube-dl and the video download is complete, but when I \nsearch for the video, I can't seem to find it.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: There are really two questions here:\n1. Why does youtube-dl not feature in Dash? \nThis is because youtube-dl is run from a Terminal window only and does not come with icons, desktop files and the like. It is simply run from any Terminal window as follows:\nyoutube-dl [options] url [url...]\n\nDetails of the command line options can be easily seen by running the following command:\nyoutube-dl -h\n\nExperiment a little to make youtube-dl work as you wish. \n2. Where does Youtube-dl download YouTube files?\nBy default youtube-dl will download the files in the current working directory of the Terminal that you have opened. Usually this is your $HOME environment, but not always. This behavior can be modified in either of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the -o option with youtube-dl to manually give a location for the downloaded files: \nyoutube-dl -o \"~/Desktop/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" 'youtube file url'\n\nand of course substitute your actual url for 'youtube file url'. This example sends the completed download to your Desktop.\n\n*Create a configuration file for youtube-dl as follows:\ntouch ~/.config/youtube-dl.conf\n\nThen set a default download location in this file:\n--output \"~/Desktop/%(title)s.%(ext)s\"\n\nWith this in place all downloaded files will automatically go to your Desktop.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*youtube-dl Readme\n\nA: If you run youtube-dl like this:\nyoutube-dl -o \"/home/vasa1/Downloads/%(title)s\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnvK2TIhYns\n\nThe video should be in /home/vasa1/Downloads. Of course you need to put your username in place of vasa1.\n\nA: by default youtube-dl downloads it's files on your home directory\nto access your downloaded filed\nplease open the terminal \nchange the directory to your home directory\nuser:~$ cd /home/user\nNotice: user is your user name\n\nA: By default youtube-dl downloads files in the same directory from where you run the command. Mostly it's your home directory. If your name is Tom, then it is /home/Tom. To force it to download elsewhere you should use -o option; and to select quality of video, there is -f option. But how would you know the variety of quality of files. That is achieved by -F option. So combine all these in one shell script, make it executable and put it in a bin directory. And life becomes easy going.\nI have written one script for my own use. It works fine. You don't have to worry where all those downloaded files are going. I've chosen ~/Videos directory for downloading YT videos; you can choose any other. Also replace 'Tom' by your name. Here is the script:\n#!/bin/sh\nanswer=\"\"\ntput clear\ntput cup 05 10\necho \"Give the YouTube URL: \\c\"\n# Here you paste the YT-video-URL by ctrl+shift+V\nread answer\n# The follwing command will display a list of video quality options to choose from\nyoutube-dl -F $answer\necho\n# Here you give the number shown in first column as per your choice\necho \"Select Quality (Choose a number): \\c\"\nread qual\n# If you don't want to download and quit the shell, give 99\nif [ $qual -ne 99 ]\nthen\nyoutube-dl -f $qual -o \"/home/Tom/Videos/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" $answer\nelse\nexit 0\nfi\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 14 fix of official installation procedure \nCreate directory here:\nsudo mkdir /opt/youtube-dl\n\nMove youtube-dl from installation place:\nsudo mv /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl /opt/youtube-dl\n\nMake symlink:\npushd /usr/local/bin/ && sudo ln -s /opt/youtube-dl/youtube-dl\n\nTest symlink:\nls -la youtube-dl \nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 26 Oct 16 20:41 youtube-dl -> /opt/youtube-dl/youtube-dl\n\npopd\n\nTest file:\nls -la /opt/youtube-dl/youtube-dl\n\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 639567 Oct 15 12:42 /opt/youtube-dl/youtube-dl\n\nFix permissions:\nsudo chmod 755 /opt/youtube-dl/youtube-dl\n\nRemove old cache:\nsudo rm -r /home/<user>/.cache/youtube-dl/\n\ne'voila! youtube-dl without having a need for a sudo in front of it\n\nA: In case you want to run youtube-dl in python script, simply use -o will no effect. \nInstead you need to use outtmpl keyword, e.g.:\nyoutube_dl.YoutubeDL( params={'-c': '', '--no-mtime': '', 'outtmpl': './%(uploader)s/%(title)s-%(upload_date)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s'} ).download([url])\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 13.10 can't mount hard drive that is on my router So I am working currently with my Ubuntu server which I have it on my laptop at the moment so I can test out how to work with the server OS.

Check the disks utility from your dash and look for the external drive in the list of disks utility. \nIf you can see the drive then you can execute self tests or benchmark test;\nelse if it was not there; try to change the connection cable;\nelse if you tried on another computer and is working, your operating system should be cleaned from the old system files.\nelse if, format it.\n\nA: If there is any bugs on the Linux kernel, it shows \"wrong filesystem type\" error when you connect USB or external HDD to the pc. Run the below command on the terminal to update your Linux kernel.\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\nOnce the kernel is successfully installed, reboot your PC.\n", "Q: Launcher Icons Collapse My launcher's icons collapse when I run out of space. How do I turn this off?\n\nA: This behavior is by design. As far as I know, there is no way to change it. \nThe collapsed icons will show themselves as you move your mouse up and down over the launcher, just like you would do with your finger on a touchscreen.\nYou can re-arrange the order of the icons by clicking the icon and holding it for a second, dragging it to the right towards the desktop, and then dropping it where you want it higher up. The new order will be stay the same in future sessions.\n\nA: I have found the solution: this isn't enabled in Ubuntu 2D. I don't know if using 2D causes any other problems / disadvantages, other than losing the \"Aero Snap\" feature.\nTo change from Ubuntu to Ubuntu 2D, at the login screen, click on the Ubuntu logo, and then chose Ubuntu 2D. If you then do a non-forced shut-down, then it will save this preference.\n\nThis is no longer avaliable for 14.04+.\n", "Q: Is it Possible to install evernote on Ubuntu using Fogger? I found that, there is not official client of Evernote for Ubuntu.

I've upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10 and noticed that Files (Nautilus) stopped updating my bookmarks that are located in another partition (an ext4 one). It used to work before. \nTesting, I've found out that, if I add any new bookmark (using CTRL + D, for example), Files then adds this new one and updates all bookmarks, showing that ones that point to my partition. I conclude that the feature (updating bookmarks) works, but it's not being executed when I mount my partition clicking on it.\nAny hints on how to solve this? Bookmarks really speed up everyday activities.\n\nA: I've found out that this is a known bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/1246493\nDespite not showing up in the nautilus bookmark pane, as described here, you can still quickly access bookmarks by right-clicking on the nautilus icon and bookmarks will be displayed as a quicklist:\n\nBut I've figured out a workaround. Would Nautilus show my bookmarks if I set my partition to be mounted at Ubuntu startup time? Yes, it would. :-)\nBeware that Ubuntu mounts partitions at /media/yourusername/partitionname when you mount them by clicking on them. So, your bookmarks will point to this location. When I tested mounting my partition using udisks command, it mounted at /media/partitionname. Searching has brought this solution:\nHow can I change the mount point path while using udisks?\nResume: Set your partition to be mounted at startup, at Startup Applications on Ubuntu, using this command: \nudisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sdaY (change Y to your partition number!)\nNow my partition's bookmarks are displayed correctly.\nFor the ones who don't know how to add a command to be executed at startup time, I recommend reading Ubuntu documentation on Auto Mount Partitions, section Per-User Mounts, subsection Adding to startup. Section Finding the device name of your Partition explains how to find your device name (the /dev/sdaY in my example above).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Minimal in the new Intel NUC Haswell I have one the of the new Haswell NUCs that just came out - D34010WYK. \nhttps://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&DwnldID=23089&lang=eng&OSVersion=OS%20Independent&DownloadType=Documentation),\nI tried to load ubuntu minimal 13.10 x64 from the mini.iso and it cannot properly detect a network during install - my guess is a driver issue.

You can actually dual boot within the virtual machine as well. \nIt's far safer testing in a vm than actually dual booting, but as far as effectiveness, really depends on what you want to do as Jo-Erlend Schinstad already said.\n", "Q: Broken Display After Installing Kubuntu on Older Mac Pro I downloaded the Kubunutu 13.10 64-bit installer and made a bootable USB stick.\nI want to install Kubuntu on a fresh partition on my Mac Pro 1,1 which is currently running Xubuntu 13.10 (as well as Mac OS X). I had to do the install by booting the installer on my newer Macbook, since the Mac Pro will not boot Ubuntu disks or USB sticks (something about EFI or some such).\nSo I booted the installer on the Macbook, and installed into the new partition on Mac Pro via Firewire Target Disk mode. The install succeeded, and I am able to boot into Kubuntu on Mac Pro. But the display is wonky, perhaps because it was installed from a different machine with a different monitor(?). \nThe login screen looks fine, and some of the \"desktop\" (forgive my terminology; I'm new to KDE) such as the \"Desktop\" button in the upper right corner of the screen is OK. But the panel along the bottom of the screen is completely trashed, as are any menus and popups. I can hack around and launch Konsole and Dolphin and they display normally, but parts of the windows get blanked out randomly.\nI managed to launch bin/systemsettings and looked at the Display and Monitors setting. It shows the proper display resolution.\nHow can I straighten this problem out?\nEDIT:\nI just tried Plan B, installing the kubuntu-full package into my working Xubuntu partition. Kubuntu has the same display problems. Xubuntu continues to work fine.\n\nA: The problem might be in using proprietary NVidia drivers, there are few ways how to solve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the recommended way of installation. Check the Mac Pro documentation page:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacPro\n(or MacBook Pro apporoach might be also helpful: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro)\n\n*Install Linux with the old school way from DVD, which installs grub-pc and boots Linux in BIOS compatibility mode (without (U)EFI)\n\n*Use alternative drivers (might depend on specific (k)ubuntu version and MacPro version)\n", "Q: Why does wifi hotspot doesn't work correctly? I have created the wifi hotspot. In windows, it used to display wifi signal on my nokia C3 but after creating wifi hotspot from ubuntu, I am facing certain problem.\nNokia C3 doesn't even gets wifi signal.\nBut wifi signal appears in my samsung mobile GTS3-850 and I can access wifi if I put wifi security option to \"none\"\nOn the other hand, if I create password then \nNomatters, if I type right password or not, it doesn't connect to that wifi.\nNote : I use Wimax to access internet.\n\nA: I think I have an answer for you now. \nI had an opportunity to test this with an Android device and it just doesn't work. The reason is that Android no longer supports ad-hoc networks, meaning that I'd have to configure my hotspot using the \"Infrastructure\" setting in the dialog like you can see in the screenshot below. Unfortunately, my Wifi adapter doesn't support that. \nIf your Wifi adapter supports it, I think that should work with both Android and your Nokia C3, but since I have no way of actually testing it, I'd appreciate if you could and provide feedback. :)\n\n", "Q: How do I get to terminal after upgrading to 13.10 I upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10 and now when system starts it goes to a black screen.\nI believe that the problem is related to the drivers for the NVidia graphics cards.\nHow can I get to a terminal so as to disable the updated driver??\nThanks\n\nA: Try Strg + Alt + F1 to open the console even if you're not logged in.\nYou might need to add a function key if you are on a laptop.\n", "Q: I just upgraded to 13.10 in my virtual machine through Virtual Box but can restart successfully This is what i see after i restart.\n\nHow can i fix this?

Startup really confuses me.  It seems various methods for starting things happen in different locations all over the place.  But is there a way to define the order they are loaded?\nSpecifically... I have an issue where Plex Media Server (PMS) can't be discovered by clients if the server's VPN connection is established prior PMS starting.  It was driving me nuts, but I discovered that I could solve the problem by shutting down PMS, shutting down the VPN, turning on PMS and then turning on VPN.\nI'm not exactly sure how PMS auto-loads itself at startup, but the VPN is something I defined by editing: /etc/network/if-up.d/slickvpn with the following:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nREQUIRED_CONNECTION_NAME=\"Wired connection 1\"\nVPN_CONNECTION_NAME=\"myvpn\"\n\nactiv_con=$(nmcli con status | grep \"${REQUIRED_CONNECTION_NAME}\")\nactiv_vpn=$(nmcli con status | grep \"${VPN_CONNECTION_NAME}\")\nif [ \"${activ_con}\" -a ! \"${activ_vpn}\" ];\nthen\n    nmcli con up id \"${VPN_CONNECTION_NAME}\"\nfi\n\nThat's a script I found somewhere (I think on this site) when looking for help autoconnecting a VPN.\nSo I guess /etc/network/if-up.d/ scripts are initiated prior to the PMS service.  How can I flip that?  Or other solution?\n\nA: I think you may want to give upstart a try instead. You can stop the VPN server from starting in the ifupdown scripts (moving the file somewhere else) then make some upstart jobs.\nCreate (or modify if it's already existing, you should search in /etc/init) the PMS start up file in /etc/init and fill it up (**if it's already present, just take note of the name of the .conf file):\n# pms - Plex Media Server\n\ndescription \"Plex Media Server\"\n\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)\n## here you can define what interface you can wait, just change IFACE!=lo for IFACE=eth0, etc.\n\n## This stops the job at shutdown\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nscript\n    exec /path/to/pms/server/binar\nend script\n\nThis is very basic upstart script. You should add/modify things around. Now the other script:\nCreate the /etc/init/vpn.conf file and fill it with the following content\n# vpn - Virtual Private Network server\n\ndescription \"Virtual Private Network server\"\n\nstart on started plexmediaserver\n## now, the VPN server will only start if PMS starts :D\n\n## This stops the job at shutdown you can modify it and make it to stop before stoping PMS\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nenv REQUIRED_CONNECTION_NAME=\"Wired connection 1\"\nenv VPN_CONNECTION_NAME=\"myvpn\"\n\nexport REQUIRED_CONNECTION_NAME\nexport VPN_CONNECTION_NAME\n\nscript\n    exec /usr/bin/nmcli con up id \"${VPN_CONNECTION_NAME}\"\nend script\n\nDone.\n", "Q: How to install Visual Python?

Except for one thing: Lightdm crashes at seemingly random times, on average 2 times on a normal working day. I have no idea why, and I don't see a pattern. I've obviously looked through askubuntu and other resources but can't seem to find a solution, or even a clue as to what might be wrong. \nDetails: \n\n\n*\n\n*When a crash occurs the screen freezes, but the mouse cursor still moves freely. I can move the mouse around, but I can't click on anything.\n\n*I see no discernable pattern in user behaviour when a crash occurs. I often have VLC media player open, and almost always a browser. At first I thought it might be the browser, so I switched from Chromium to firefox. The problem remained. So it isn't seemingly related to any one program. \n\n*I can press CTRL-ALT-F2 to bring up a commandline, then run sudo lightdm stop and sudo lightdm start. This kills lightdm and starts it again, but I lose everything I was working on at the time.

I downloaded unetbootin-windows and also ubuntu-13.10-desktop iso. I ran unetbootin and chose USB and it seemed to create folders on my USB drive along with the WUBI.EXE. \nBut now I'm not sure what the next step is. I want a dual boot system. OR to run Ubuntu alongside Windows. When I ran WUBI was given the option to reboot now or later. What will this do? \nRON\n\nA: To clarify what has happened:\n(It is important to know that your hard disk is divided up into \"volumes\", aka \"Partitions\". Right now, you probably just have one partition, which is dedicated to your Windows OS. Your goal is a full Ubuntu installation, which would reduce the size of the Windows partition so it doesn't take up your entire hard disk, and add two more partitions for Ubuntu.)\nYou have installed Ubuntu using Wubi, a program that installs Ubuntu \"within\" Windows. When you reboot, which you should at this point, you will see the option to boot Ubuntu, which has been installed to a virtual filesystem within the Windows partition. See What's the difference between Wubi and a regular \"alongside Windows\" installation?\nIf you run in to serious, unfixable problems with this, you should uninstall the Wubi version of Ubuntu by booting Windows and uninstalling the Ubuntu program from \"Add/Remove Programs\" (keep in mind that, while this appears to be treating Ubuntu as if it were a Windows program, it is more complicated than that.) Then, boot from your USB thumb drive and do a full installation of Ubuntu. If your computer doesn't boot from the USB key automatically, you may have to change the BIOS settings by entering into setup upon boot, or bring up a one-time boot menu if your computer has it and use that to boot from the USB thumb drive.\n", "Q: Nexus 7 stuck on Google screen Ubuntu Touch I'm trying to install Ubuntu Touch on my Nexus 7 with these instructions.

I am using VLC player to play videos over this network drive and I find that the quality of the video is not as optimal as I would like it to be - seeking takes a good 10 seconds while I get the occasional stuttering (green screen) playing 540p videos, let alone 1080p.\nMy current setup permits a 1.8 MB/s bandwidth (tested with SCP), so I don't think network latency is that big an issue here. \nI have trouble tweaking VLC because I am not technically streaming videos in the VLC player - VLC has no idea I am playing over a LAN network. Hence, I am unable to set the stream buffer and cache values that are specific only to network streaming on VLC. \nIs there anything I can do to improve my current set up? Will using a media streaming server help (like Amahi)? Are there more efficient protocols than SMB for this purpose? \n\nA: Have you looked at using Webdav instead. It is a HTTP based file share. This is the direction I am currently leaning. I just started researching this as a option. I have a 8tb raid5 running ubuntu server and streaming to multiple VER1 Apple TV's stripped of factory OS and running XBMC. (trying to cut the cord with sat. provider) Having issues with samba and looking for an alternative. XBMC supports webdav natively so it seemed like a natural next thing to try. Other things you could look at is \nadding XMBC or PLEX software to handle it. Nice thing about that is the pretty interface you get for browsing you content\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV\nif you want a quick overview.

I'm trying to build sdrangelove, which wants Qt 5 and uses CMake for its build system, on Ubuntu 13.10. What package do I need to install to give it the file it's asking for here?\nThere are a lot of *qt5* packages, and I've tried installing the promising looking ones to no effect. All the discussions I've found either have things working fine or are talking about writing CMake build rules rather than executing them. I don't have a lot of experience with the organization of Debian/Ubuntu packaging.\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):\n  By not providing \"FindQt5Core.cmake\" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has\n  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by \"Qt5Core\", but\n  CMake did not find one.\n\n  Could not find a package configuration file provided by \"Qt5Core\"\n  (requested version 5.0) with any of the following names:\n\n    Qt5CoreConfig.cmake\n    qt5core-config.cmake\n\n  Add the installation prefix of \"Qt5Core\" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set\n  \"Qt5Core_DIR\" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If\n  \"Qt5Core\" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has\n  been installed.\n\n\nA: I just stumbled upon this question while trying to compile KeePassX 2.0.\nWhat helped me was to use apt-file to search for the missing packages:\nFor example running this:\n\napt-file search Qt5CoreConfig.cmake\n\nReturned the following packages:\n\nqtbase5-dev: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt5Core/Qt5CoreConfig.cmake\nqtbase5-gles-dev: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt5Core/Qt5CoreConfig.cmake\n\nThese packages can then be installed with apt or apt-get, e.g.:\n\nsudo apt install qtbase5-dev\n\n\nA: If you tried the above solutions and it didn't work, also try apt-get install libqt5opengl5-dev, that worked for me.\n\nA: Two things I was missing:\n\n\n*\n\n*After an unsuccessful build, I must remove CMakeCache.txt (or simply clear the build directory); otherwise cmake will report the same error even if the needed package has been installed.\n\n*The packages which provide the *.cmake configuration files have names of the form qt*5-dev, e.g. for the error in my question, qtcore5-dev.\n\nA: Also, possible to fix the installation issue, by direct package install through rpm (See the content https://centos.pkgs.org/7/epel-x86_64/phonon-qt5-devel-4.8.3-2.el7.x86_64.rpm.html).\nAnd another possibility is through \"source build and install\" : http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/7.9/kde/phonon.html\nThis is typically due to improper installation of the phonon4qt5 (version 4.8.3) through \"apt-get\". At times, this is resolvable by \"synaptic\" installs for the missing libs/parts of the package.\n", "Q: Colored Vertical Lines upon boot and nomodeset DOES NOT fix it I have installed Lubuntu 13.04 on a Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop, rebooted the machine and encountered this problem. I edited the GRUB configuration to remove \"quite splash\" and enter \"nomodeset\", updated grub, and everything was fine. I could reboot the machine without any trouble.\nHowever, if I unplug the machine, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in, the problem with the colored lines comes back and nomodeset no longer helps to solve the problem. I tried using radeon.modeset=0 instead of nomodeset and that also works on multiple reboots until I unplug the machine and plug it back in. I was finally able to get around the problem by entering \"radeon.exapixmaps=0\" instead of radeon.modeset=0. I suppose I kind of made up that boot option using some information from an Arch Wiki page. This would work throughout reboots and even if I unplugged the laptop. It was working fine for quite a while.\nA few weeks later, I had some unrelated issues with the Java iced-tea plugin, and since 13.10 had just come out, I thought I would try upgrading. So upgrading didn't fix the problem with Java, and after unplugging the machine and trying to use it later, I was back to this problem with the black screen and colored vertical lines.\nI am completely out of ideas on what to try. It took me a week to figure out how to get it working the first time, but the solution I had isn't working anymore.\n\nA: Well, I figured it out. The fact that unplugging the machine and plugging it back in led me to try out some of the other standard boot options. So using acpi=off in addition to nomodeset fixed the problem with the colored lines. However, it created the new problem of not completely turning off the computer when running shutdown.\nThis all turned out to be an issue with the BIOS. I painstakingly worked out how to update it and it looks like I don't need to have acpi=off anymore.\n", "Q: Apache Virtual Host setup not working?

Can someone explain to me the GUI and CLI of Ubuntu Server?\n\nA: By default the Server version of Ubuntu has an interface similar to this one:\n\nSo, only the command-line is available.\nSource: Ubuntu Server “desktop” versus Ubuntu Desktop Version.\n\nMost Ubuntu Server developers recommend not installing a GUI on a server. There are multiple reasons for not installing a GUI. \nSome reasons to not install a GUI include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You'll have more code subject to security vulnerabilities, more\n  packages that need updating, and more server downtime. \n  \n*Performance may\n  suffer because resources (memory, hard disk space, CPU, etc.) will be\n  consumed by the GUI. \n  \n*It is best practice to only install needed\n  software on a production server. \n  \n*The GUI may include other network\n  services that are inappropriate for a server. \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*One of the goals of\n  Ubuntu Desktop Edition is to make it easier for users to use Linux.\n  When installing some desktop environments, services that you may not\n  specifically want will be installed. For example avahi-daemon, which\n  is used to help configure networking, adds another open port and may\n  introduce unwanted DNS conflicts with a .local domain.\n  \n  \n  \n  So for the most secure server it is best to\n  not install a GUI.\n\nSource: ServerGUI.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you run Ubuntu Server with a GUI?\n\nA: \nWhat is the user interface design of Ubuntu Server?\n\nThere's no user interface for the Ubuntu Server. Just a plain log in prompt and 6 TTY's. In fact servers do not include a User Interface beyond a prompt.\n\nCan someone explain to me the GUI and CLI of Ubuntu Server?\n\nUbuntu server is just a strip down version of the Ubuntu Desktop packages. It includes the very same set of packages. If you install any of the -desktop packages you will notice no differences. Ubuntu (Linux) is modular. You can plug/unplug as many part/pieces you consider. The differences between you installing the Ubuntu Server and any of the Desktop versions is that you will not have a GUI to boot, but can dedicate all those resources to your servers (daemons).\n", "Q: no launcher, no dash, no unity, how to get back to my desktop?

I have Xubuntu-12.04 LTS on my Sony VAIO P with Intel GMA-500 graphics for more than a year. I have solved some issues using the fixes suggested in the Poulsbo-wiki but unfortunately some issues still remain ... most importantly: I'm unable to use external displays for presentations!\nThe kernel version of my installation is 3.2. I've read and heard that most problems regarding the Intel GMA-500 graphics cards are solved with the 3.4 Linux kernel and newer versions. Also, I've read about the \"LTS Hardware Enablement Stack\" for 12.04, which provides back-ports of the stable-kernels + X-stacks of 12.10 Quantal (Linux-Kernel-3.5) and 13.04 Raring (Linux-Kernel-3.8) for 12.04 LTS. It seems that even the new-kernel + X-stack of 13.10 Saucy will also be made available for 12.04 LTS, but at the current time, I only see the kernel in repos, and not the X-stack.\nMore detailed info: LTS Hardware Enablement Stack\nSo my question is : \nIs it recommended for me to install this \"LTS Hardware Enablement Stack\" in hope of resolving my issues with Intel GMA-500 graphics ?! If yes, which one is more recommended (Quantal or Raring) ?!\n\nA: Since nobody answered, the only way to find out was to test the \"LTS Hardware Enablement Stack\" and see if it works or breaks ...\nI installed Raring's stack (kernal + Xorg) with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-raring xserver-xorg-lts-raring\n\nAnd reboot ...\nThe system booted fine and almost everything worked, even some-things that didn't work before, such as brightness controls. But one major problem showed up: with every other boot, Xorg consumed a lot of CPU capacity (about %25), and the system was super slow and laggy! I don't know what was the cause, but it was either a bug in Xorg or a bug in the kernel module for Intel GMA-500 graphics.\nSo I thought to try Saucy's stack in hope of solving the problem, since it has a newer version of the Linux kernel. The thing is that the kernel-package of Saucy is available but not its X-stack. According to this link, it is not a good idea to use a kernel with a different X-stack but in my situation I had no other choice, so I gave it a try ... I installed Saucy's kernel with the following command, and Raring's X-stack remained:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-saucy\n\nAnd reboot ...\nEverything worked fine! :) Now all the problems of my Xubuntu-12.04 installation on the Sony VAIO P with Intel GMA-500 graphics are solved without the need for any tweaking:\n\n\n*\n\n*The screen works fine with the standard resolution and adequate performance;\n\n*External VGA port works and secondary monitors are handled fine;\n\n*Brightness controls work;\n\n*Suspend/Resume works;\n\n\nNow I'm a happy Xubuntu user on my Sony VAIO P which is way more faster and responsive than the standard Windows-7 which came pre-installed on it!\nOf course there is one limitation: the graphics performance on Linux is much lower than the performance on Windows. For example, I almost can't watch any kind of video format on Xubuntu, while all video files with resolutions below HD (720p) play fine in Windows ... Although this is a problem I can live with, it would be really great to sea this fixed in Ubuntu-14.04 LTS.\nFinally, my general recommendation is that if practical, do a fresh installation of the latest version of Xubuntu (which currently is 13.10 Saucy). When the next LTS version is released (14.04 Trusty) perform an upgrade or again do a fresh installation. But if your situation is like mine and you can't afford a fresh installation right now, installing Suacy's kernel with Raring's X-stack can fix a lot of problems.\nUpdate:\nSince the release of the 14.04 Trusty, the most recent LTS release, it is recommended to use its HES:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-trusty\n\n", "Q: How to I configure which Audio Hardware is being used by Pulse Audio, ALSA, and Jack Audio? Here's my setup\nToshiba Laptop with internal sound card, HDMI digital sound out, and a external m-audio Conectiv USB sound card (4-in/4-out equating to 2 sets of stereo ins/outs).\nI use this setup for recording music, and DJing. I'm trying to figure out how to get a similar setup to how I use these devices in windows (roughly).\nWhen I use MIXXX DJ software I'm able to select all the outputs of my M-Audio sound device by sending one deck to one set of outputs, and the other set to the other set of outputs so I can use my external mixer. This isn't the problem, but this illustrates my point later on. The point here, is that I'm able to use both outputs at the same time with this software.\nNow, after I sucessfully setup JackAudio and am using Ardour 3 for recording/producing I realized that JackAudio doesn't see all my inputs/outputs of my m-audio sound card. It only sees one set of input/outputs (one half of the card). and Pulse Audio is using the other set of outputs. \nSo, for instance if I have Ardour running on the first set of outputs, I can use Audacious and play mp3's which defaults to the other set of outputs (granted it locks up because jack locks the device up. The problem is that when I configure Jack Audio, I notice that only half of the outputs from my m-audio device show up in the control panel.\nAt one point of time in the past I remember being able to use JackAudio to access both sets of in/outs on my m-audio card.\nI've also noticed that when I look up the ALSA panel, ALSA is using the set of outputs that JackAudio has access to, and Pulse Audio is using the other set. (granted in pulse audio my internal laptop audio is set to the default output).\nMy suspicion is that Pulse Audio is grabbing the set of outputs that Jack Audio can utilize, and is blocking it from appearing in the Jack Audio Preferences. So I think that if I can find out how to get pulse audio to \"let go\" of the set of outputs that Jack Audio can't get, it'll work.\nso, as of now in my pulse audio control panel I have access to\n-Built-in Audio\n-HDMI Audio\n-M-AUDIO DFU RunTime (using channels 3/4 as outputs)\nALSA has access to everything as well, however the outputs of the m-audio card are the 1/2 output.\nI want to be able to access simultaneously all the ins/outs of the m-audio card with Jack Audio so I can route to external analog mixer.\nSo, how can I define with audio device is controlled by ALSA, Pulse Audio, and ultimately Jack Audio?\n\nA: I don't know if my answer if going to help you.\nI was also confused with ALSA, Jack, Pulse connection / configuration.\nWhat I read, what I use and what I got is:\n\n\n*\n\n*ALSA / JACK mainly works with only one sound card. So, JACK expects to carry sound from the input of one card, through processors / programs to the outputs of one card.\nIn this link you have a bit outdated manual for Ardour 3 where I got this information and how to configure the system to use more than one sound card: Ardour 3 manual\n\n*I am using ubuntu studio 14.04 at the moment. \nI got confused with mixxx and videos played on firefox (vimeo, etc.) connections. \nSupposedly you can run all audio through Pulse but I got all sound \"jammed\" somewhere in the system. \nI solved it configuring (by order):\n1) Mixxx to send audio to ALSA / Pulse (so running Mixxx before QjackCtl). \n2) Opening QjacCtl (that automatically connects Pulse Jack sink).\n3) Setting general audio output on Ubuntu to outputthrough: Pulse Jack Sink\nI don't know if there is an easier way to accomplish this.\n\nA: Try Cadence (from KXStudio repositories).\nIt has JACK bridges for ALSA and PulseAudio so you can control everything from Cadence.\nI had good results with my problematic M Audio sound card.\nI quote this answer https://askubuntu.com/a/742249/514869\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudioPreparation (instructions plus more features)\nOpen a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type the following commands.\ninstall the very basics :\nsudo apt-get install vlc ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntustudio-menu cdrdao\nInstall needed tools\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common wget\nEnable KXStudio repo (press 'Enter' once asked)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kxstudio-debian/kxstudio\nUpdate software sources\nsudo apt-get update\nInstall kxstudio-repos\nsudo apt-get install kxstudio-repos\nUpdate software sources again\nsudo apt-get update\nThen download the Cadence binary from http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Cadence  (bottom of the site)\n\nIn Cadence, select your sound card in Configure< Driver< Device, then I guess you should be able to configure the outputs (simultaneously hopefully).  Dont forget to Start the ALSA Midi and PulseAudio JACK Bridges.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 13.04 support AVX instruction set? I am using Ubuntu 13.04. I want to know if it supports AVX Instruction set. Please let me know. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Intel AVX is a new-256 bit instruction set extension to Intel® SSE and is designed for applications that are Floating Point (FP) intensive. It was released early 2011 as part of the Intel® micro-architecture code name Sandy Bridge processor family and is present in platforms ranging from notebooks to servers. Intel AVX improves performance due to wider vectors, new extensible syntax, and rich functionality. This results in better management of data and general purpose applications like image, audio/video processing, scientific simulations, financial analytics and 3D modeling and analysis.Intel\nAVX is supported since kernel version 2.6.30, which was released on June 9, 2009.\nHere is the kernel version used by Ubunut 13.04;\nLinux ubuntu 3.8.0-23-generic #34-Ubuntu SMP Wed May 29 20:24:54 UTC 2013 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n\nHence it supports the AVX Instruction set\n", "Q: How do I recover files from U1 cloud OK I have just stopped syncing a folder. This appears to have been a huge mistake. I did not realise the folder would disappear from my cloud storage. I assume (and hope) the sub-folders/files it contained still exists in the cloud. I hope they still exists in the cloud because they do not exist on my computer. I did not delete these files from the cloud (I have tried to recover deleted files - none are being recovered). Where are they and how do I get them back into My storage?\n\nA: There are two ways to stop synchronizing a folder. One is to stop synchronizing the folder locally while still keeping the “cloud” copy alive. This is done from the Ubuntu One Control Panel, by deselecting the per-volume checkbox that is labelled “Sync Locally?”,\n\nWith this option your files will remain on the cloud, and on any other devices where you have previously (or thereafter) selected that checkbox.\nThe other way (which was removed for new installations as of 13.10) is to remove the folder from Ubuntu One entirely. This is done from the Nautilus context menu,\n\nWith this option the volume and its files are removed from the cloud, and will no longer be synced to other devices where they might have been synced before. They won't be removed from this or other devices, but you no longer have a way to retrieve them from the website. The “recover deleted files” does not recover deleted volumes.\nThe file blobs will be removed after the usual window, but you've lost the handle on them. At this point you're pretty much out of luck if you later remove the files and need them back.\n\nFrom the commandline, the control panel action corresponds to u1sdtool --unsubscribe-folder, whereas the nautilus action corresponds to u1sdtool --delete-folder.\n\n\nA: Please Login to the Ubuntu One Account with your web browser with this link.\nUse your existing ubuntu one account name and password. When you got in to the main page, Click to the files link. At the next page, there should be a link saying, \"Recover deleted files\"\n\n\n*\n\n*If your files are still there, you can download them.\n\n*If your files are not there, try \"Recover deleted files\" choice.\n\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: New Outlook Double (two step) Authentication on Mail Clients like thunderbird I am using Thunderbird without any issue until I enabled two way authentication in my Outlook account.\nSince then on  start up, my Thunderbird is asking to enter a new password and I have to recreate a new apppassword by going to my account settings via browser.\nAny good alternative to this procedure??\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: Once you enable 2-step verification feature, some programs such as Windows Live Mail, Thunderbird, etc will not allow you to sign in using your current password. It happens because these kind of programs don't support 2-step verification security codes. To solve this problem, you'll need to create App password using simple steps given here : http://www.askvg.com/fix-mail-apps-and-devices-shows-incorrect-password-error-after-enabling-2-step-verification-in-microsoft-or-gmail-account/ \n", "Q: tomcat7 server - can't install into Eclipse Kepler?

To resolve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close eclipse\n\n*In {workspace-directory}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings, delete:\norg.eclipse.wst.server.core.prefs and org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core.prefs files\n\n*Restart Eclipse\n\n\nThat's all. You can check this source which refers to this other source.\n\nA: Be sure that Tomcat is stopped first before adding it in Eclipse. You do not need to start or stop Tomcat outside Eclipse because you can do it inside Eclipse.\nYou may be forgetting to fill up the Server name textbox. Next button will be ungreyed once you filled up that textbox.\n\nUpon clicking Next you need to specify the Tomcat installation directory (if you downloaded a binary) as highlighted in the Tomcat installation directory textbox. You can also click Download and install button if you don't have Tomcat yet or if you just want to be sure of that you want have the right version.\n\nYou can either click Next or Finish. Click Next to add a previous project to Tomcat. Otherwise click Finish to return to your current perspective.\n\nAfter returning to your perspective, just in case you are not in Java EE perspective, do this: From the menu bar click Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> Java EE. As you can see at the bottom I have selected the Servers tab and my newly created Tomcat server is already there and was stopped. You can start or stop this server by right clicking it.\n\n\nA: just goto windows->preference search or type in box server and select default filesets then select tomcat version and click add  to add the tomcat folder\nClick Apply and then ok\n", "Q: Home directory not being created I am trying to understand system administration on Ubuntu. So, as an example, I create a dummy user using \nsudo useradd -d /home/linda linda\n\nand passwd to create the password. I check that an entry has been made using cat /etc/passwd\nlinda:x:1004:1004::/home/linda:/bin/sh\n\nHowever, when I su - linda, I get \n\nNo directory, logging in with HOME=/\n\n\nand indeed, no home directory has been created. What am I missing?\nThanks.\n\nA: Use -m instead of -d, so the directory will be created for you:\nsudo useradd -m linda\nAlso, if linda is a normal user, you might want her to use /bin/bash as default shell:\nsudo useradd -m linda -s /bin/bash\n\nA: You can also modify /etc/pam.d/common-session to make it so that a user's home directory will be created on first log in.  Add the following line to that file.\n...\nsession required pam_mkhomedir.so\n\nThis is particularly useful if your system is on a network where the users are managed externally to your machine, by LDAP for instance.\n\nA: you can fix this simply by creating the home dir.\nmkdir /home/linda\nchown linda:linda /home/linda\n\ntry logging in again and this should work.\n\nA: Add the below entry in /etc/login.defs and save:\nCREATE_HOME yes\n\nNow, try to create user accounts. It will create the home directory. \n\nA: According with man useradd, -d /home/linda option will not create the directory /home/linda, if this is missing. So, you have to create it manually. To do this, run the followings commands in terminal:\nsudo -i                            #to get root privileges\nmkdir /home/linda                  #to create the directory /home/linda\ncp -rT /etc/skel /home/linda         #to populate /home/linda with default files and folders\nchown -R linda:linda /home/linda   #to change the owner of /home/linda to user linda\n\nSee also: How to make user home folder after account creation?\n\nA: The most likely reason why you did not have the home directory created is because you did not have the CREATE_HOME yes in /etc/login.defs. \nYou can fix this by following what @OmPS or @Radu Rădeanu had suggested.\nBut that many ways to overcome this problem in future by using one of the commands below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Result of sudo adduser linda\nAdding user 'linda'\nAdding new group 'linda' (1001) ...\nAdding new user 'linda' (1001) with group 'linda' ...\nCreating home directory '/home/linda' ...\nCopying files from '/etc/skel' ...\n****Password confirmation****\n****Name prompt****\n\nThe defaults for adduser are chosen from /etc/adduser.conf if\n--home option is not specified.\nNote that it also copies the /etc/skel contents.\n\n*Use adduser with --home\nsudo adduser --home /home/linda\n\nSame as previous option except that you may want this if the users\nhome directory is different than the username that you assigned.\n\n\n*\n\n*Specify base directory to useradd command:\nsudo useradd -b /home\n\n\n*Use login.defs: Modify /etc/login.defs and add the line below before doing sudo useradd:\nCREATE_HOME   yes\n\nNote: if you do man login.defs, it currently says \nMuch of the functionality that used to be provided by the shadow password suite is now handled by PAM. Thus, /etc/login.defs is no longer used by passwd(1), or less used by login(1), and su(1). Please refer to the corresponding PAM configuration files instead.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use pam_mkhomedir PAM module: from man pam_mkhomedir page, add the line below to /etc/pam.d/login:\nsession  required  pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel\n\n\nA: man useradd states:\nuseradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian,\nadministrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.\n\nNote the low level utility\nTo add a user, use adduser instead. It's a more high-level utility.\n\nMoreover, looking at the -d option:\n   -d, --home HOME_DIR\n       The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the\n       user's login directory. The default is to append the LOGIN name to\n       BASE_DIR and use that as the login directory name. The directory\n       HOME_DIR does not have to exist but will not be created if it is\n       missing.\n\nThe directory will not be created if it is missing.\nGenerally, keep away from useradd, use adduser instead.\n\nA: Look at /etc/defaults/useradd if you want to change the defaults. Use:\nuseradd -m -d /home/joe -s /bin/bash.\n\nA: Use adduser. \nDESCRIPTION\n\n adduser  and  addgroup  add users and groups to the system according to\n   command    line    options    and    configuration    information    in\n   /etc/adduser.conf.   They  are  friendlier  front ends to the low level\n   tools like useradd, groupadd and usermod programs, by default  choosing\n   Debian  policy conformant UID and GID values, creating a home directory\n   with skeletal configuration, running a custom script,  and  other  fea‐\n   tures.  adduser and addgroup can be run in one of five modes:\n\nuseradd you have to add all options yourself. Including permissions and some other things.adduser does this based on sane defaults (and also adds home dir by itself).\nIf you need to use adduser you probably need the -b option together with the -d option!\n\nA: If /home/linda is not present before you add linda as a user, you also would have to add --create-home. \nsudo useradd --create-home linda\n\n\nA: useradd command doesn't create a home directory automatically, regardless of the default settings in /etc/login. You have to specify the -m option if you want a home directory for a system account to be created.\n", "Q: What partition PlayOnLinux and Wine software has to be installed to?

You may want to create a new partition and mount it in your /home/user/.wine directory instead:\nAfter you have created the new ext4 partition, run sudo blkid, it will show something like:\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"bf554a2f-a035-4c22-bca8-162def35a03c\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"3962db06-3776-4f38-8ab9-eab6feeccc1d\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n\nLets assume sda2 is your new partition, edit /etc/fstab and add the following entry:\nUUID=3962db06-3776-4f38-8ab9-eab6feeccc1d /home/user/.wine ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nOf course, change user for your actual username. Done.\n\nA: I'm not really sure what you're actually asking, but playonlinux itself is installed by the package manager to /usr/whatever or some similar directory, so on the partition where your / is mounted. The different wine versions and windows applications are installed into /home/username/.PlayOnLinux (.wine if you use wine directly without playonlinux).\nYou can move the .PlayOnLinux or .wine directory whereever you like (as long as the permissions stay the same) and then create a symbolic link to it.\nFor example if you move your .Playonlinux directory to /mnt/data/ you can create a symbolic link with the following command:\nln -s /mnt/data/.PlayOnLinux ~/.PlayOnLinux\n\n", "Q: removed plymouth made my ubuntu lost I had removed plymouth using \nsudo apt-get remove plymouth \n\nThis also removed all other packages like ubuntu-desktop., grub., unity., etc..\nNow I'm not even getting tty .\nIs there any way to get back everything \nor \nShould I need to start again with a fresh copy of Ubuntu \n\nA: I'd recommend a complete reinstallation.\nThe other possibility would be to reinstall the lost packages from your Live Ubuntu.

This tool makes it very easy to send an email with a one line command. \nhttp://caspian.dotconf.net/menu/Software/SendEmail/\nYou could write something along these lines:\nmyip=`wget -q -O - checkip.dyndns.org|sed -e 's/.*Current IP Address: //' -e 's/<.*$//'`<br>\nsendEmail -f you@yourmail.com -m $myip \n\n\nA: A bit of an old thread but it comes up pretty high on the list when you Google search for how to monitor for external IP changes.\nAs an alternative option that might help you, I've written a python script designed to monitor for external IP address changes.  It currently saves the \"current\" external IP address to a file and, when run, grabs a new IP address and then checks it against the old one.  It is design to email you if a change is detected.\nIt's designed to run as a cronjob and does not run as a background daemon on its own.\nHere's the link to the github repository: https://github.com/begleysm/ipwatch\nHopefully it helps!\n\nA: This is what I used, setup my server to send emails with the updated (and former) IP using my gmail account installing postfix from this link.

So in this setting this user can also write to your directories.\n\n*chown www-data\nYou can also transfer the ownership of your directories to www-data. Now obviously www-data can write. However in this setting the user john can't write.\n\n*Use POSIX ACLs\nACL stands for access control list. Using this mechanism you can give additional users additional rights, i.e. write for www-data. See this answer for a description: How to make a directory with permanent permissions different from default\n\nA: I think 755 is appropriate permission if you don't want other group members to write to that area and read only, but if you really want groups to write should use 775.\n", "Q: why nothing happens when booting through usb?

I have been running Ubuntu for a bit now. Today my motherboard died and I want to know if I can plug my hdd to another computer, would it boot and run Ubuntu normally.

The difference between the two are that /media is used for removable and /mnt is used for more permanent storage. Removable storage is always automatically mounted in /media and is shown on the launcher when mounted.

More complex programs, like unetbootin, were designed with BIOS-mode booting in mind. Furthermore, EFIs vary greatly, making it impossible for developers of such tools to test on a wide enough variety of systems. Such tools can therefore sometimes create USB flash drives that are unbootable in EFI mode.\nI do not recommend installing in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode except as a last resort. Doing so will require you to install an EFI-mode boot loader after the fact, which is extra work that can itself cause confusion and complications. (I can't count the number of questions I've seen from people who need help with this.) That said, on rare occasion it is necessary to install in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and deal with the EFI boot loader installation issues, or even re-install Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode to work around particularly buggy EFIs.\n\nA: I had similar problem with Dell XPS 13 but with Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit. While trying to boot from USB it was going in an infinite loop as you mentioned. I had Legacy boot option as default. I then changed to UEFI mode which had only Network option in it. I then added a boot option and selected the USB file system location. Saved the BIOS and rebooted it worked fine!\n\nA: On my version of UEFI on an ASUS VIVOPC The boot order cannot be changed from UEFI, and there fore I could not force a boot from my USB drive. However, after disabling secure boot, and enabling CSM legacy I pressed F8 upon start up and was able to select my USB drive and boot. \n\nA: I had the same problem. I had Ubuntu and Windows, but I wanted to downgrade Ubuntu.\nSo, in the \"Advanced\" tag I disabled \"Secure boot\". In the \"Boot\" tag I disabled \"Secure Boot\" and elevated \"USB hdd\" to the top, while blocking (Shift+1) ! ubuntu, !  Windows Boot Manager and another hard disk. This way it finally worked. \n\nA: This is an old question and I just drop some steps that were needed in 2021, perhaps it helps someone since it took me far too long to find out how to boot from the USB stick in UEFI.\nIn my case, I had Windows 10 which was already installed in UEFI mode, thus, it already had an UEFI partition ready. Perhaps that is your case as well, but I am not sure since you only write that it is \"UEFI-supported\" Windows 8. I guess that you can choose between the legacy BIOS and the UEFI. If you are not already in UEFI mode for Windows 8, you must switch to UEFI mode before you start the Linux booting of the steps below.\nThe steps:\n\n*\n\n*Download the Linux ISO (I took Linux Mint 20.1 Cinnamon 64bit).\n\n*From the downloaded ISO, create a GPT bootable stick with the free program \"rufus\".\n\n*Shut down your computer and put in your boot stick.\n\n*Press F2 within the first 2 seconds at start to enter UEFI. If you have a NOVO button (a much smaller button normally right next to the larger power button), press that instead.\n\n*As said in the quesiton, set \"Secure Boot\" to Off and switch \"Fast Startup\" to Disabled.\n\n*You might also assign an admin password in the second menu tab (remove this again after everything has been done!) - by this, you will get more boot menu options in the second last tab, so that you can choose more than just the \"Windows boot menu\". This step is probably just optional, see the next point.\n\n*The next step is to go to the \"exit\" menu in UEFI. Go down to \"boot override\" and select your Linux boot stick.\n\n*Linux will load an in-memory version from the stick. Douple-click \"install Linux\" on the Desktop.\n\n*If you want to preserve Windows, as you state in the question, you should create a new partition only for Linux and choose that to install to. For this, go to the program \"gparted\" (type it in the start menu) and split the largest disk, that is shown - usually the \"data\" disk - into two disks, one for Windows, one for Linux. In my case, I even decided to drop Windows completely at this point. Then you would need to delete any partitition except for the UEFI partition which should be top 1 in the list. You can only do this after \"unmounting\" the Windows disk, meaning you just stop showing the Windows data disk on your Linux Desktop, either you unmount it with a right-click, or you accept to unmount it in a menu question.\n\n*Follow the installation menu. In my case again, it also asked me to unmount two other Microsoft reserved disks, while in your case, when installing Linux it parallel to an already installed Windows, you should have got the Linux partition right using gparted, so that it will not ask you any such questions at all.\n\n", "Q: \"Add Event...\" button, why is there? If you click on top right (by default) on time, you will see calendar. Below calendar there is button \"Add Event...\", but if you click it, it does nothing.\nWhy is it there, how can I use it?\n\nA: It does nothing because there is no GUI calendar application installed.Install evolution (GUI for evolution-data-server calendar).\nsudo apt-get install evolution\nAfter that it will work.\n", "Q: How to record video streamed to Firefox I'm using Ubuntu Precise 64 bit. Is there an app which will capture video & audio from a TV programme being played on my PC? I'm thinking of the video coming on Demand. PS by capture, I mean record to disk. \n\nA: None of above apps work for me. I've got ffmpeg (command line program) to do the job.

It ok to make new partitions when system is already installed? Just open GParted and start to make new partitions, Or is it recommended during OS installation process?\n\nA: GParted won't adjust any partition that's currently in use, but it should be able to alter partitions that are not currently mounted and create new partitions in unpartitioned areas of the disk. In some cases you can unmount a mounted partition (GParted can do this, in fact), but you will never be able to unmount your root (/) partition, and possibly not some others. If you need to adjust them, you'll need to boot from a live CD to edit the partitions.\nSome other tools, such as the text-mode fdisk and gdisk, do enable you to edit partitions that are in use; however, these tools don't support filesystem resizing, and if you edit in-use partitions the kernel won't use the changes until after you reboot.\nIf this information isn't sufficient, you'll need to post more details about what you want to know -- what type of editing do you need to do, what are your current partitions, etc.\n\nA: You cannot move/resize/delete a mounted partition in Gparted.If you boot ubuntu,at the time of booting your ubuntu partition will automatically mounted.so after booting into ubuntu,gparted can't able to resize/delete your ubuntu partition.\nIf you want to make partitioning on Ubuntu partition,the only option is Gparted-live-disk.Because gparted on a live disk booted up(live disk partition only mounted,it was like /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc)but the hard-disk partitions was not mounted(it was like /dev/sda).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10: No Bluetooth adapters found My notebook is Fujitsu LH532 with Bluetooth version 4.0 (smart ready).

I am currently running Gnome.\nI have looked at other pages from the Google search \"ubuntu unity failed to load 13.04\", but the advice was similar to above and seems to be concerned with a system upgrade in April 18, 2013. I suspect my issue is something far more recent.\nPlease give me advice on how to restore Unity on my account or at least figure out what the problem is. Thank you.\nSome information that might be relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity has worked fine on 13.04 for the 6 months that I've had it until today. (November 10, 2013)\n\n*I have set up the update tool to automatically update when available. It is very possible that the system applied some updates without my knowledge.\n\n*Interestingly, Unity works fine on the Guest account.\n\n*I have made it so the system automatically logs me in at start-up.\n\n*This is a personal laptop. No one else has access to it.\n\n*I was not doing anything with the system settings or the terminal and have not installed any new software for the past 3 days.\n\n*I am running the System76 native Linux laptop Ultra Lemur. I did not contact their support yet because it seemed unlikely that this is a System76-specific error.\n\n\nA: \nIt turns out you need to run the below commands while running Gnome (I was previously trying to do this while on the broken Unity) dconf reset -f /org/compiz/ && unity --reset-icons &disown.\nThe Unity launcher appeared above the Gnome menubar. I logged out and logged in to Unity and everything works fine now.\n\n(answer provided by OP in comments.)\n", "Q: Stop nautilus getting focus/stacking order when I drag and drop files/folders into applications In MS Windows when you have opened a file explorer (equivalent of nautilus in Ubuntu) and another application opens on top of that (for example explorer in full screen mode and some application opened in windowed mode on top of that) and you click on the file/folder explorer that window gets focus. \nSo far this works exactly the same in the Ubuntu. However when you have the same situation and you click and drag on some file or folder, than the file explorer window does not get focus which allows you to drag and drop items from that folder into that application very quickly and easily. How can I achieve the same behavior in the Ubuntu?\nIn case it's not clear what I am asking for I will try to write it in other words. \nWhen you have more than one window/applications stacked and you click or click and drag into one of them the window with the file icon you click gets focus and is moved to the top of the stacking order. As a result it covers other windows. I want to leave the stacking order as is when I click and drag some file or folder and only change the stacking order when I single click in that application window. It works exactly as I want it to when I drag and drop files from the desktop into some application.\nI often work with multiple windows/applications opened at the same time and the inability to easily drag and drop files and folder from nautilus into my apps is very annoying to me and it slows me down more than I am willing to sacrifice.\n\nA: As of now, you cannot do this with Ubuntu or any other system based on X11. (On MS Windows it only works for the file manager. On MacOS it works for everything, modulo bugs.) Making it possible requires changes to toolkits and window managers which, in the past, developers have been unwilling to make; it's not a failure of X11. Perhaps with the new graphics systems, like Wayland and Mir, it will be possible.\n", "Q: Alfa AWUS036NHR connection issues I'm running Ubuntu 13.10, and the wifi card, Broadcom BCM4313, running driver wl0, shows networks but won't connect to them. I've kind of given up trying to fix this, and bought an external wifi adapter, an Alfa AWUS036NHR, which uses the driver rtl8192cu. This works ok, but every few minutes, the connection freezes. Sometimes it is fixed by disconnecting and re-connecting to the AP, but sometimes i have to un-plug it and plug it in again. I can also re-set it by removing and re-loading the driver with modprobe, but I'd like to know if there's a definitive solution to this. Thanks in advance.\nBtw. I am using a Lenovo G580\n\nA: I've also been having crazy problems with lenovo G480 and the broadcom adapter.

For me, I had to turn off the taskbar and applications menu extensions.  Then one can use the method described by Buğra Koç above.\nThis means the easy switching on and off of line numbers and word wrap in gedit is gone.\nIf you don't need text highlighting Leafpad is a good replacement for gedit.  It looks like the old gedit:\nsudo apt-get install leafpad\n\n\nA: In my desktop, I found it here:\n\n\nA: To get the preferences entry back to the edit menu perform the following command in a terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides '@a{sv} {\"Gtk/ShellShowsAppMenu\": <int32 0>}'\n\nThe problem results from Gnome3 putting the preferences menu entry to the top menu.\n\nA: Just type Alt+E, then again E when you are in gedit.

In the end, I figured out that it was because I was still logged in as the superuser. Once I logged out of the terminal and reopened the terminal, everything went back to normal.\nJust thought I'd throw that out there in case anyone else hits the same problem. \nIf you're seeing a # instead of a $ at your command line, this is likely why you can't see your defaults. \n\nA: Some preferences, such as display line numbers can be activated from the options in the gedit bottom bar(right side).\n", "Q: Why does my global menu freeze in Ubuntu 13.10? When using Ubuntu 13.10 I often get my global menu frozen.\nFor example if I scroll down on the volume icon (to lower the volume) the notification and the actual volume is modified 3 to 10 seconds after the action. This behavior is the same with globalmenu entries and every notification icon.\nThis behavior happens randomly to my eye.

The first screenshot is of Eclipse when I do not run it as root. The toolbar (i.e. the bar with 'file,'edit,' 'refactor' and so on) is merged with the system toolbar. I could bear with this except for the fact that none of the icons are clickable- that is, clicking 'file' gives no dropdown\nThe next screenshot is of the Eclipse when run as root- the toolbar is slightly offset from system toolbar, it has the layout that we all know and love, and is perfectly functional.\nFor the life of me I can't figure out why this is happening. I've tried redownloading Eclipse, running it under both open and sun JDK's, and every situation the same problem arises. As you can imagine it's rather annoying to have to navigate to the executable, open a terminal, and run it with sudo privilieges whenever I want to open Eclipse (which is a lot), so I'm looking for solutions to this annoyance.\nI'm, again, running Ubuntu 13 (never had this problem with 12), using the Sun JDK.

Just in case. File system corruption does occur on Wubi installs, and sometimes a symptom like not being able to rename a file might be an indicator. (Although this time it's probably that the swap wasn't turned off).\nSo you would run:\nsudo su\ncd /host/ubuntu/disks/\ndd if=/dev/zero of=newswap.disk bs=1024 count=2097152\nmkswap newswap.disk\n\nThen reboot to Windows and replace swap.disk with newswap.disk.

Creating a new user using adduser, everything what is necessary for a new user to use the GUI is created.

I hope I am able to do\nthat with Bash but I am not very efficient with it.\n\n\nA: For always placing certain windows on certain desktops, I recommend Compiz's Place Windows plugin. It lets you assign windows to desktops based on window name or class.\nTo access compiz settings, install the settings manager:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now run command \"ccsm\". This'll open advanced settings for the Compiz window manager (don't worry, the settings manager is clear enough that you won't screw up your system unless you're really trying ;).\n\n*Just scroll down or search for \"Place windows\".\n\n*Go to tab \"Fixed Window Placement\". Under \"Windows with fixed viewport\", click \"new\".\n\n*Add a new window to the set by clicking the plus sign.\n\n*You can select a window based on class (which application it belongs to), role (which window of a certain application), etc.. You can play around with this until you get a feel for it. To fill in the value, use grab and click the crosshairs on the window you want to select. I've found that grabbing a window title doesn't work, but you can always fill it in by hand.\n\n*When you have the window you want, fill in the X and Y coordinates of the desktop to assign it to. Voilá! The window will not open on that desktop by default (but you can still move it after it's been opened).\n\n\nHaving certain applications launch at startup is even simpler: just open unity and search for \"Startup Applications\". Here you can add every application that you want launched after you login.\nNote: depending on how fast your application launches at startup, it may launch before Compiz is ready, in which case it will not be placed on its assigned desktop, but on the first desktop instead. I've been looking for a solution to this myself. Maybe it's as simple as using \"sleep 3 && /usr/bin/myapp\" instead of \"/usr/bin/myapp\".\n\nA: By the way: if you're into productivity and automation, you might like easystroke and guake.

What also made it tricky for me, I had originally used the on-board ATI video card, so I had few references to fglrx libraries, which was probably causing the error about missing libatiuki.so.1 library.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10: wpa_supplicant crashes on login Every time I log in, and sometimes multiple times in a row, I get a error message. I don't seem to have any problems with the functionality of my computer. I'm running ubuntu 13.10 on a google pixel, has a Qualcomm Atheros AR9462 wireless network adapter (not sure if that will matter here).\nScreenshot of error details\n\nA: Running this command fixed the problem for me\n\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install network-manager-gnome network-manager-pptp\n\nNote: after running this command, my custom keyboard shortcuts seem to have been reset.\n", "Q: No such device = Grub Rescue 13.10 Noob here. I just installed 13.10 yesterday And it booted up for me several times and all was well. Then this morning when I went to boot I received a \"No such device\" error and a \"grub rescue\" command line prompt. I tried running the live disc and re-installing Ubuntu 13.10 However that was a fail. The same messages kept occurring. Then I tried to boot up in Windows 7. Also a fail. I then attempted to run a Windows 7 restore disc. You guessed it - Fail. This sucks. What do I do?\n\nA: I can't comment, but did you end up upgrading grub at some point? This causes many people errors... And be more descriptive what grub rescue line comes up\n\nA: You can fix GRUB via the Ubuntu install disk.  You do not need to re-install Ubuntu.  When initially opening the Install disk there is an option to Repair Ubuntu.  Click through the various screens until you get to a menu that mentions repair (or re-instal grub).  Choose that menu option and the system will rebuild grub for you (including recognising Windows partition and adding a grub menu option for that).\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Partitions are gone after installing ubuntu 13.10 I have installed Ubuntu 13.10 today. I selected it to overwrite my windows 7 operating system. However, after booting up Ubuntu I saw that my partitions are gone and all the space is showing up us in one partition. Why is this happening? Have I done something wrong while choosing to overwrite windows 7? I understand that while overwriting windows 7 it will format my C: drive there, but why my other partitions are gone? Is there any way that I can get my data back?\n\nA: It depends on the options you chose when installing Ubuntu.  If you chose the incorrect option (basically over-write everything), then Ubuntu installer re-partitions the entire drive.  There is no recovery from that unfortunately.\nYou have to be very careful choosing the correct partition option otherwise you will lose all data.  And there is no coming back from that.\nIf you cannot see other partitions then I think the news is not good.\n\nA: Yes, unfortunately you wiped you pc. I hope you happen to have a recovery disk ( comes with computers original packaging ) to restore back to windows... For all your files back you need windows back... In Ubuntu you can get an assortment of you files back... Open \"Ubuntu software\" center and type testdisk... Install it. And then run that.., then do quick search on your computer not your flash drive ( If one is plugged in ) and then when that finishes press enter for deeper search... It will show a list of partitions... You select the one that looks appropriate an more will appear... Go over them and press P until see primary file ( recycling bin, download, along those lines ) press C on the partion, and then use the arrow key to make a P in front of it... Then continue the loading on testdisk and it will restore.. { same process or windows }!!! This is a few hour process, it takes a long time to find all partitions...\n", "Q: How do you add Application detailed information to display in the Dash? There is plenty of information about creating a launcher for the Unity Dash.  No problems there.  However when you right-click on an application, it is possible for the Dash to display much more detailed information about the program.\nHow can I do this with a custom launcher?  I have created several .desktop files and they work perfectly, but I have several very similar versions and want to be able to right-click and get more information about the specifics of each launcher.\nIs this possible in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The Dash > preview takes/displays the info from the app's package info, specifically Description:\nFor a custom .desktop you could use a 1 line description via a Comment=line in the .desktop\n", "Q: Lubuntu 13.04: Can't find Catfish in the menu I don't seem to have any earch options in Thunar.

Unlock Applications folder This question relates to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  I wish to move a folder from the desktop into the applications folder at /home/usr/share/applications.  When I attempt to drag the folder from the desktop to the applications folder, I get the following message:\n\"Error moving file: Permission denied\"\nPermission or no permission, I want to move a folder from the desktop to the above said applications folder.  How do I authenticate so I can make this move?  There is no opportunity to authenticate when I get the error message, only \"Skip\" or \"Cancel\".  I don't want to skip or cancel, I want to authenticate and move the folder.  How do I do this?\nOn top of things, when I try to use PCmanFM and attempt to open the applications folder as Root, I get the error message: \"Switch User Command Not Set\". What do I do now?  Thanx!\n\nA: You have to be root to do this because the permissions are obviously set so.\nFirst solution:\nTry to find a \"Open current Folder as root\" in your file managers menu bar. I use PCManFM, and in that case it is under \"Tools -> Open current Folder as root\". After that just copy files as you wish.\nSecond solution:\nOpen terminal the terminal and type sudo cp -R /path/of/source /path/of/destionation. Use the -R option if you want to copy a folder, you don't need it for regular files. After you hit Enter, type your password and that's it.\n", "Q: I have an HP Pavilion dv6 A1U58AV and the headphone jack does not work Whenever I plug a set of headphones or an aux cable into the headphones jack the computers speakers turn off, but no audio comes out of the headphones or the aux cable.\n\nA: First of all, lets keep it Ubuntu related ;) and second that means your plugin in the wrong aux port:) their are many times two audio ports, and only one will work with most headphones, also certain headphone aren't compatable \n\nA: Updating ALSA by going to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS fixed the problem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Unity 13.04/13.10 systray no longer present From what I can tell, a decision was made to remove the systray from 13.04/13.10.

The very simple interface looks like this:\n\nThere can't be much to misunderstand in this GUI. I have chosen to create a USB stick with a live version of Ubuntu, which will save files and settings from session to session, on the USB drive, right?\nWell, it just doesn't save anything. I go in, create a file on Desktop, restart and it's gone. \nI did the whole procedure three times, i.e. first creating the USB, then testing if I could save. \nHave I misunderstood something?\n\nA: Bug 1159016 is for broken presistence on UEFI machines.  \nThe live media has two boot mechanisms, syslinux for non-UEFI and grub for UEFI machines. \nThe persistence mechanism is simply a word \"persistent\" on the kernel boot command line, and while the syslinux boot works with persistence, the word was missed in the grub.cfg file.  \nYou can add it yourself. Edit the grub.cfg (usbpen/boot/grub/grub.cfg) file and add persistent just before the file= on the vmlinuz lines.  And yes, your desktop will be part of the things which will be saved when things are working.\nE.g. \nmenuentry \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" {\n    set gfxpayload=keep\n    linux   /casper/vmlinuz.efi persistent file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper quiet splash --\n    initrd  /casper/initrd.lz\n}  \n\n\nISO formats changed about 14.04, making changes as suggested above more difficult (editable FAT filesystems can no longer be used on the USB).  The best current way to make a persistent USB is to use the mkusb tool from mkusb download site.  The mkusb-installer should set things up for you. \n\nA: Live USb is actually an installation media. It has a standart setup. \nYou should use it to install Ubuntu in a different USB/HDD. When you choose to try it, it always open as a fresh ubuntu from a standart setup.\nAt the picture I saw, You created a live (installation media) from the .iso file to the Kingston Data Traveller.\nNow you should (can) use it to create Ubuntu OS with the install choice to a new usb.\n", "Q: After installing Ubuntu how do I know that all devices have their necessary drivers In Windows after a fresh install I go to the device manager to find out which devices have yellow question mark on them ie driver is missing\nwhat about Ubuntu? sometimes you cant even tell that the driver is missing cause the device function is not visible like co-processor or something like that\nIn Windows you can find out about similar devices using the device manager\n\nA: Open a Terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\nuse this commands\nlspci\nlsusb\n\nThey will give a detailed report.\nThis command also can be used to list all devices to a file on your desktop.\nsudo lshw -html >Desktop/myconfig.htm\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu Linux, and GNU/Linux in general, we often just check for the desired result functionality instead of checking that \"all necessary drivers were loaded\". \nIn other words...\n\n\n*\n\n*if you want to test sound, try playing a music file or a YouTube video.\n\n*if you want to test graphics, try playing a 3D game or press Super (Windows key) + W rapidly.\n\n*if you want to test your mouse, move your mouse around and press the buttons. \n\n*if you want to test your keyboard, type on your keyboard. \n\n*if you want to test your webcam, try the free program \"cheese\"\n\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu 13.10 from 12.04 lts I have ubuntu 12.04 lts installed on my hp pavilion and I want to try 13.10.

I've been trying to troubleshoot the issue for a while now and no luck. I have a radeon hd 8250 card. I know it's not much to go off of but any help would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: If you want to try the Ubuntu 13.10 live CD, you can safely try it without installing Ubuntu 13.10, assuming that you can find a solution to the problem that the Ubuntu 13.10 live CD is booting to a black screen. \nYou can also upgrade directly from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04 without any additional complications. That is because both Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 14.04 are Long Term Support (five year support) releases, and it is possible to upgrade from a Long Term Support release to the next Long Term Support release. It is also highly recommended not to skip over the next supported release in the distribution upgrade path when doing a distribution upgrade.

But there are other bootloader too, such as LILO (LInux LOader) and recent BURG.\n\n\n*To learn Grub command, You can use the Grub manual here.\n\n*Grub Customizer is a graphical interface to configure the GRUB2/BURG settings and menu entries.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n", "Q: How do I make plugins work in rhythmbox 2.99.1?

I don't understan the following which is written in another post: \"look to activate the plugin via a Tool menu option.\" Where can I find this?\nMany thanks in advance\n\nA: Plugins in newer versions of Rhythmbox can often activated through the Tool's menu option.\nPictures paint a thousand words...\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets enable a plugin - Hover you mouse at the top-panel and click Rhythmbox to show the menu\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Plugins menu and find your plugin.

I'm trying to tweak a .conkyrc (the weather bit  of this one) that includes (not quite) this line: \n${image ~/.conky/google-now/images/humidity.png -p 0,155 -s 15x15}${goto 35} SOME STUFF ${voffset 15}\n\nThe -p 0,155 positions the image variable. I read the documentation for goto, I know that goto 35 prints the next element at position 35 but I don't quite know what that means. The voffset pushes the text down, but setting voffset to 155 doesn't seem to push the text down to the image. How do i line them up?\n\nA: I would still love some kind of screen ruler thing that would make this easier, or code to report the position to the screen, but  offset and voffset adjust x or y based on your current location -- they're relative to where text would appear if you didn't offset it. goto is absolute -- position 35 is 35 pixels (I might be off about the units) from the left hand margin. offset 35 is wherever you are plus 35 pixels. Image placement (-p 0,155) is similarly absolute. \n", "Q: Hardware question; booting ubuntu off of USB flash drive? I'm currently running ubuntu off of a USB 3.0 flash drive on my laptop, and I have another USB 3.0 flash drive I use for storing larger files that I need to access and whatnot.

The only problem is that suddenly the game loses frame rate. The movements loses the smoothness. After sometime it just returns to normal. \nDoes anyone know how to fix this issue?\n\nA: There could be several reasons why it happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*An application start running in background.\n\n*Your system runs out of memory and start swapping.\n\n*Your system disk is heavily fragmented.\n\n*Your graphic card has problem rendering an specific artifact\n\n*Gremlins in your PC.\n\n\nYou should run heuristics diagnosis on your system, make sure everything is optimized for playing, that nothing could slow it down.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 won't detect my external monitor and nvidia-xconfig doesn't work Ubuntu won't detect my external monitor. I'm running Ubuntu on a Lenovo ThinkPad W530 with NVIDIA Corporation GK107GLM [Quadro K1000M].  I've been told to run nvidia-settings, but When I try running it, I get the following:\nYou do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.  Please edit your X configuration file (just run nvidia-xconfig as root), and restart the X server.\nWhen I do so, I get a 640x480 resolution. Additionally, when I run nvidia-settings again, I get the same error message.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\nUPDATE: I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 and it works now.\n\nA: Thinkpad models with optimus have some of their external displays connected directly to the nvidia card, and the thinkpad display is connected to the integrated intel card. (See this blog post).\nEasiest workaround (at least on the W520) is to go into the bios and change the display mode from \"nvidia optimus\" to \"discrete\". This will cause the laptop to ONLY use the nvidia card on all displays, which makes it possible to use multiple displays, but significantly decreases battery life.

So just open and can export to xcm.\n\nA: copied from OP edit:\n\nFound also Gursor Maker - Cursor Editor for X11/GTK+; got the CVS code from SourceForge - it still uses Numeric (the old name of numpy), so to run it, you'll have to do:\n#from Numeric import *\nfrom numpy import *\n\n... in xcurio.py, curxp.py, gimp.py, colorfunc.py  - and comment the #from xml.dom.ext.reader import Sax2 in lsproj.py.

I'd hoped to Dual Boot to at least get the benefit of both worlds. \nI created a partition for it in Windows and installed from a LiveUSB key (and installed into that parition). So now Ubuntu works great, but Windows 8.1 no longer shows up on the start up screen (where you theoretically pick which OS you want to boot in). \nI was going to try \"Boot Repair\" as mentioned here and restore MBR, but I don't want to start messing around with stuff I'm not entirely clear with. \nEDIT:\nFor any of those who stumble here with the same problem, I just read here that a user wiped out his Windows partition by accident... \nI checked my own computer with sudo fdisk -l and there's only one Device Boot (dev/sda1). I'm not an expert, but I'm guessing that means Windows has been written over.    \n\nA: From what I read on your explanation it sounds like you did erase your windows installation. I would suggest you read this:\nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/221835/installing-ubuntu-on-a-pre-installed-windows-8-64-bit-system-uefi-supported\n\nAnd from personal experience I would suggest when you are planning on dual booting, always install windows first and linux last. Linux works well with other operating systems, but windows has a tendency to not play along well. What happened to me was that it would not show an option to start linux, and many times it would also try and remove linux altogether, so understanding partitioning helps, but installing linux last helps even more X_x\n", "Q: Sound in Ubuntu 12.10 on Chromebook I've got an HP Chromebook 14 that I've rooted and installed Ubuntu via Crouton (upgraded to 12.10) and most things are working nicely.\nOne issue that I am having trouble solving relates to sound. I've got sound output that I can control via the individual app (e.g. Youtube), but when trying to control the volume via the built-in xfce4-mixer, I get the following error:\n\nGStreamer was unable to detect any sound devices. Some sound system\n  specific GStreamer packages may be missing. It may also be a\n  permissions problem.\n\nOpening a terminal, I can run the alsamixer and control the volume levels. It is reporting back that the card is CRAS. I'd love to be able to do it from XFCE and the built-in mixer.\nI've tried re-installing the GStreamer packages, but no luck. It seems like I am close but not sure where to go from here.\nOn a maybe unrelated note, plugging headphones into the headphone jack in Ubuntu also does not stop the sound from coming from the speakers and nothing comes through the headphones. Switching back to ChromeOs, everything works as expected, so I think that it's a driver issue.\n\nA: I'm using an Acer chromebook running an xfce desktop using the same method that you probably used.  I was able to get audio working with the panel audio mixer plugin by installing pulseaudio and then starting it from terminal with pulseaudio --start.\nAfter a reboot, everything worked as expected.\n", "Q: I want to Install Wine without an internet connetion?

Several years back, we were more accustomed to changing to the root account using the su command. First, we switched to the root account, and then executed those root commands. Now we are more accustomed to using the sudo command. \nBut we know that the root account is there. We can readily find the home directory of user root.\n$ ls -ld /root/\ndrwx------ 18 root root 4096 Oct 22 17:21 /root/\n\nNow my point is, it is stated that \"the root password in Ubuntu is left unset\". Please see the answers to this question. Most of the answers\nhave something to this effect in the first paragraph. One or two answers further state that \"the account is left disabled\".\nNow my (primary) questions are,\n\n\n*\n\n*What is meant by an unset password? Is it blank? Is it null? Or something else more cryptic?\n\n*How does the account becomes enabled once I set password for it? (sudo password root)\n\n\nIn order get a better understanding, I checked the /etc/shadow file. Since I have already set a password for the root account, I can no longer see what is there (encrypted password). So, I created another account and left it disabled. The corresponding entry in the /etc/shadow file is,\ntestpassword:!:16020:0:99999:7:::\n\nNow perhaps my above queries need to be changed to, what does an ! in password field mean? Other encrypted passwords are those very long cryptic strings. How come this encrypted form is only one character long? And does an account become disabled if I put an ! in\nthe (encrypted) password field?\n\nA: \nWhat is meant by an unset password? Is it blank? Is it null? Or something else more cryptic?\n\nIs just inexistent. Root account is disabled by default, hence it doesn't need password. So, what most resemblance has is undefined (in JavaScript) or (null) (other languages). It is just unset.\n\nHow does the account becomes enabled once I set password for it?\n\nActually, setting the password is just part of it, but doesn't enable the account. You need to enable the account using:\nsudo usermod -U root\n\nand then set the password with passwd.\n\nwhat does an ! in password field mean?\n\nExtracted from man shadow:\n\n\nA password field which starts with a exclamation mark means that\n               the password is locked. The remaining characters on the line\n               represent the password field before the password was locked.\n\n\nIt could mean that the account is locked. But also:\n\n\nIf the password field contains some string that is not a valid\n               result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able\n               to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the\n               system by other means).\n\n\nEither way, any account with ! can't log in with applications that use the shadow file.\n\nHow come this encrypted form is only one character long?\n\nIs not encrypted. See above.\n\nAnd does an account become disabled if I put an ! in the (encrypted) password field?\n\nSee above too.\n\nA: I'm learning about that as well as it's a new topic for me. From what I understand the account exists but is not enabled, so trying to use it just keeps on responding that the credentials are wrong. It appears to be to make it harder for malicious users to know why they can't crack the password. If you already have it set I would highly suggest that you undo it with:\n    sudo passwd -dl root\n\nand to learn more about it go to:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.3 64 bit with Nemo 2.0.x no thumbnails I have strange problem with thumbnails in my Ubuntu machine.\nI was using Ubuntu with Cinnamon 1.8 from stable ppa and it was good but then Cinnamon 2.0 came out with some broken packages uploaded to stable ppa nad things gone wrong...\nAnyway after few updates Cinnamon started to work normaly except Nemo - there are no thumbnails at all, only icons.\nI heve tried purging /.cache/thumbnails and .thumbnails folders but this doesn't work.\nNext I have changed permissions for those folders - that didn't helped either.\nThen I've set Nemo as default file manager and desktop handler but with no result.\nWhat is weird - when I start Nautilus and open some folder with images then close it and open same folder with Nemo thumbnails appears but when I clean thumbnails directories there are no thumbnails again.\nIt would be great if someone have some solution for this annoying Nemo behavior because I  really don't want to resign from Cinnamon.\np.s.\nI have set preview options in Nemo for Always and no bigger files than 4GB so that is not the case.\n\nA: In your home directory:\nremove the subdirectory .thumbnails\nset link\nln -s .cache/thumbnails .thumbnails\n\n", "Q: global menu not working on some apps like evince and nautilus Global menu does not work on evince, nautilus, etc, how can I get it back to these apps which should be compatible with global menu. \n\nA: Please see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ayatana-design/+bug/1131664\nThere are people working on fixes to use classic menus instead of the new simple menus.\n", "Q: Web sites do not work when I am logged into Google Chrome or need to log in to Google This problem is really weird.

Since I don't have a machine 3 it is pending.\nHow can I get it to deploy to the 3 node I already have ?\nHere is my juju status...\njuju status\n2013-11-11 20:46:51,893 INFO Connecting to environment...\n2013-11-11 20:46:52,563 INFO Connected to environment.\nmachines:\n  0:\n    agent-state: running\n    dns-name: 8ypjm.ceph\n    instance-id: /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-d8686094-48c9-11e3-b313-deadbeeefb1a/\n    instance-state: unknown\n  1:\n    agent-state: running\n    dns-name: a8nke.ceph\n    instance-id: /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-88a58b34-48cb-11e3-9d7d-deadbeeefb1a/\n    instance-state: unknown\n  2:\n    agent-state: running\n    dns-name: f7fby.ceph\n    instance-id: /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-c7d89b0c-48cb-11e3-b313-deadbeeefb1a/\n    instance-state: unknown\n  3:\n    instance-id: pending\nservices:\n  ceph:\n    charm: cs:precise/ceph-16\n    relations:\n      mon:\n      - ceph\n    units:\n      ceph/0:\n        agent-state: start-error\n        machine: 1\n        public-address: a8nke.ceph\n      ceph/1:\n        agent-state: start-error\n        machine: 2\n        public-address: f7fby.ceph\n      ceph/2:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: 3\n        public-address: null\n2013-11-11 20:46:52,999 INFO 'status' command finished successfully\n\n\nA: In order to place units on machines, you need to use the placement directive --to.\nYou can't use this when specifying number of units however.\nSo you'd have to go:\njuju deploy --config ./ceph.yaml ceph --to 0\njuju add-unit ceph --to 1\njuju add-unit ceph --to 2\n\nThis is assuming that you already having machines 0, 1 and 2 in existence.\n", "Q: change screen orientation shortcut? In windows I can change screen orientation by \"Ctrl + Alt + Arrow\" as Arrow can be up, left, down or right.\nWhat is the shortcut on Ubuntu? thanks!\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be a default keyboard shortcut for this, but you could easily define one yourself. The commands for rotating the screen are:\nxrandr --rotate left\nxrandr --rotate normal\nxrandr --rotate right\n\nYou should be able to define your own shortcuts in the \"Keyboard\" application (Shortcuts tab), as explained here: How can I rotate my display in the most easy way?. If this works for you, that's great! However, I wasn't able to make it work this way. \nAs an alternative, you may want to delete the functions that are assigned to the keyboard combinations originally (they should be in the \"Windows\" section of the previous tab). After that, install a small program called \"xbindkeys\" to assign these keys. \nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\nCreate a configuration file:\ngedit .xbindkeysrc\n\nand enter this inside the config file\n\"xrandr --rotate left\"\nControl+Alt + Left\n\"xrandr --rotate right\"\nControl+Alt + Right\n\"xrandr --rotate normal\"\nControl+Alt + Up\n\nHope this works out for you. You can find more info on xbindkeys online!\n\nA: @Dionos's answer is good. On 13.10, I found that the correct commands to rotate are:\nxrandr -o left\nxrandr -o right\nxrandr -o normal\nxrandr -o inverted\n\nMoreover you can use builtin settings for custom shortcuts. [Windows] > type: \"keyboard\" > select keyboard settings (\"Keyboard\") > [Shortcuts] > \"Custom shortcuts\" > [+]. After adding you can assign a shortcut.\n", "Q: How do you install Visual Studio 2010 Professional?

See Safe Mode \nI would like to have a particular extension, ProCon Latte, for example, not to be disabled. \nHow do I do that by command line and which file to modify?\nEdit : Already 5 years! In fact, a complementary module like procon latte blocks adult content. I did not want to be able to override the add on through the command linux firefox -safe-mode. Now, procon latte is not compatible with firefox quantium ( 58.0 )\nSomeone said that you have to change the bashrc and that was the best solution for now. I also put a DNS (of opendns).\n\nA: Unfortunately Firefox can't selectively enable pluggins from the command line, but to do it graphically follow these steps:\nTo run Firefox normally\nTo run firefox out of safe mode simply run firefox from the command line:\nfirefox\n\nTo selectively enable/disable plugins\nTo find all your installed plugins run firefox -url about:plugins fom the command line:\nfirefox -safe-mode -url about:plugins\n\nOnce you have done that you can manually enable/disable plugins with the GUI interface.\nGoto Tools menu > Add-ons > Plugins\n\nThen disable all and reable them one at a time to see which plugins are giving you problems\n\nA: I may have a quick but dirty solution to your problem.\nProCon latte is an extension, which you can keep enabled in \"private mode\" but that may be easily disabled if you enter the \"safe-mode\".  As I see it, the question is not about debugging a browser extension etc... it is simply about not allowing a content-filtering extension to be disabled: under no circumstances. Period.\nHere is 'a way' of blocking the running of safe-mode, at least a zeroth order effort.\nIn ubuntu, the usual way to access firefox -safe-mode is through the command line.  What I did based in discussions in this post: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90998/block-particular-command-in-linux-for-specific-user  was to block a user from running firefox from the command line at all :-)  The same user can still open firefox by clicking in the side-bar or via the unity/gnome launcher... but always in 'normal'- proconlatte enabled mode :-)\nHere is what I added to my ~./bashrc file:\n/usr/bin/firefox() {\n   echo \"command not allowed for you\"\n}\nfirefox() {\n   echo \"command not allowed for you\"\n}\n\nreadonly -f /usr/bin/firefox\nreadonly -f firefox\n\nHope it helps!\nThis guy's blog http://mike.kaply.com/2012/03/16/customizing-firefox-autoconfig-files/  and the extension CCK2 wizard should be the proper way to disabling \"safe-mode\" altogether, but it's a bit heavy to read/understand for me.  \nCheers,\n\nA: It is not clear what exactly you want to achieve and why you mention \"Safe mode\" but as it currently exists, you just cannot do what you want whether by command line or GUI. \"Safe mode\" is a debugging aid and not something meant for safer or more secure browsing.\nHowever ...\n\n\n*\n\n*you can make a second profile with firefox -P\n\n*install just the extension(s) you need\n\n*set all plugins to \"Ask to activate\" in Tools, Add-ons, Plugins\n\nA: It can depend on the extension. In the case of \"ProCon Latte Content Filter\" there is an easy solution (at least for the Mac version of Firefox v54).\nFirst make sure that ProCon Latte's password option is enabled. Then make sure Firefox is not open.\nNow, find the \"prefs.js\" file in your Firefox profile folder (e.g. /Users/yourname/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/yourprofile.default/prefs.js).\nOpen the file using TextEdit [make a backup first in case you make a mistake].\nFind this section:\n{9D6218B8-03C7-4b91-AA43-680B305DD35C}.xpi\\\",\\\"multiprocessCompatible\\\":false,\\\"runInSafeMode\\\":false,\\\"\nAll you have to do is change the part that says \"runInSafeMode\\\":false,\\\" into \"runInSafeMode\\\":true,\\\"\nSave the change.\nWhen you start Firefox in Safe Mode, you will find that ProCon Latte is working, despite it claiming it is disabled in your Add-ons list.\nNote: You might find it a good idea to make ProCon Latte a global extension (this will make it available to all Firefox users as well as any new profiles you create). Just move the file called \"{9D6218B8-03C7-4b91-AA43-680B305DD35C}.xpi\" in your profile's \"extensions\" folder to the Mozilla extensions folder (e.g. /Library/Application Support/Mozilla/Extensions/{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}). You will then have to redo the alteration of the \"prefs.js\" file. This alteration would also have to be done for each user and profile if you don't want them bypassing it in Safe Mode.\nAlso, if you have a very tech savvy kid trying to get around this content filtering - get an app like \"invisibliX\" so that you can turn Firefox's profiles and extensions folders invisible.\n", "Q: Auto send error reports I am getting quite a lot of error reports (i guess i've messed up with nvidia drivers...) \nSo, is there a way to auto send them? It's quite annoying to see all those messages, but I guess it's helpful for them to be sent!\n\nA: If you have a recurring error. you should probably check the \"Don't send reports of this type\" check box on the dialog.  It will stop showing the message and will stop sending duplicate errors to them.\nHowever, if it is one that does not give that option, you can disable it in apport entirely with these commands:\n$ sudo gedit /etc/default/apport\n$ sudo restart apport\n\nIf you don't want to completely disable apport, they also point out you may be able to delete a crash file that is hanging around and causing the recurring problem with the following line:\nsudo rm /var/crash/*\n\n", "Q: Renaming HDD's in Ubuntu 13.10 I have 2 Samsung 1Tb G3 external drives and every time I start up my PC Ubuntu only detects 1 of them (presumably the one that boots quickest).  I assume it's because they're identical devices and that Ubuntu doesn't automatically designate drive letters etc like Windows. If I unplug both drives and put them in while the system is on then 1 is designated '1tb partition' while the other is named 'local disk'.  Is there a way to rename these drives so that they're visible at start up or do I need to change the names in Windows?\n\nA: You can change the drive's label using gparted.  The only thing that it has to be done from a LiveCD, since partitions have to be un-mounted to be able to have that accomplished.  \nOnce you boot from the LiveCD, launch gparted, and right-click the partition and choose Properties. Click inside the Label field and enter a new name for the partition.  Once done click on apply, and you're done.\nIf you don't have gparted, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I'm using an AMD Radeon HD 7730M with the latest beta drivers installed. Whenever I try to plug in a dual monitor I get incredibly bad screen flicker and my launch bar is displayed in the middle of my screen, but still responds as if it were on the left at it's normal position. See this image.\nAny idea what's causing this? Could it be the beta drivers? Have I not set something up correctly?\n\nA: Figured the problem. Hopefully this can help someone. I never mentioned in my question that I was using a hybrid graphics set up with a 7730 AND an Intel 4000. When you plug in a separate monitor you get a mad flickering action going on. A temporary solution someone found is listed here.\nThis worked a treat initially, however when I opened the display options and moved my external monitor to the right hand side of my laptop screen that's when the problem happened. I looked at the command I used to stop the initial screen flickering:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --auto --left-of LVDS1 --output VGA1 --scale 1.0001x1.0001\nI noticed the bit that said --left-of. This would be fine if the monitor was to the left of the main display but it no longer is!

Does Ubuntu consume more RAM? I just viewed Hacker News. There is something mentioned like \"Linux ate my RAM\". How much is it true that linux consumes more RAM.\nIt will be helpful if someone can provide guide to remove cache of application.\nAt first my pc use to boot faster than it does now. After installing many programs, I'm facing this problem.\n\nA: You didn't read the webpage. The link you provided is totally opposite to what you are claiming, so lets bring the information here for you:\n\nWhat's going on?\nLinux is borrowing unused memory for disk caching. This makes it looks\n  like you are low on memory, but you are not! Everything is fine!\nWhy is it doing this?\nDisk caching makes the system much faster! There are no downsides,\n  except for confusing newbies. It does not take memory away from\n  applications in any way, ever!\nWhat if I want to run more applications?\nIf your applications want more memory, they just take back a chunk\n  that the disk cache borrowed. Disk cache can always be given back to\n  applications immediately! You are not low on ram!\nDo I need more swap?\nNo, disk caching only borrows the ram that applications don't\n  currently want. It will not use swap. If applications want more\n  memory, they just take it back from the disk cache. They will not\n  start swapping.\nHow do I stop Linux from doing this?\nYou can't disable disk caching. The only reason anyone ever wants to\n  disable disk caching is because they think it takes memory away from\n  their applications, which it doesn't! Disk cache makes applications\n  load faster and run smoother, but it NEVER EVER takes memory away from\n  them! Therefore, there's absolutely no reason to disable it!\n\nNow lets go with the boring explanation:\nLinux philosophy is that unused RAM is wasted RAM, hence it needs to be filled with something useful, which is the cache. Caching means that instead of reading files from the old and slow HDD/SSD, it gets loaded in the RAM which is several fold faster than any of them, and at the same time it's translate into a faster programs start up, faster operations with frequently accessed data, a big gain in performance.\n\nHow to disable caching in Ubuntu?\n\nYou can't, or more like, you don't need to.\n\nDoes Ubuntu consume more RAM?\n\nAgainst what we are comparing here? Linux and Windows? Ubuntu and other Linux distributions? If is Windows and Linux, Linux has better memory management and smaller memory footprint than Windows. If it's Ubuntu and another distro, is likely that you are trying to compare oranges and apples. You must take into account the Window/Desktop Manager used, kernel version, patches applied, etc.\n\nHow much is it true that linux consumes more RAM.\n\nAgain, against what we are comparing?\n\nIt will be helpful if someone can provide guide to remove cache of application.\n\nWHY? The memory is there for any program to use if it's needed immediately they ask for them. The linux kernel doesn't count \"cached\" memory as \"free\" memory because is \"used\", but the cached memory is recoverable and gets destroyed immediately any application need it.\n\nAt first my pc use to boot faster than it does now. After installing many programs, I'm facing this problem.\n\nBoot times is extremally subjective, and since you could have installed several programs, is not wonder that your boot times were slower. My boot time cuts around 75% once I removed Mongo DB which reviewed a 300MB database. Just that program added around 2 minutes to my boot time, I disabled to start it at boot time and now my system boots in >1 minute. You should review what programs starts at boot times and disabled them instead. Disabling the cache will not help to make your system boot faster and on the contrary will make your system overall performance worse.\n\nApplication create cache so that they start quicker next time, isn't it? I just want to clear those application cache?\n\nDeppends the application, most applications doesn't use a cache without a very good reason. Browsers for example, has a cache. But this cache is of internet's objects (images, JavaScript, CSS, static content, etc) and the web page loads times are faster in subsequent visits. Other applications use cache's for storing thumbnails, frequently accessed data, etc. Those applications use in-disk caching. That cache isn't loaded in memory until the application starts, and it isn't count as cached memory.\nApplications normally can't submit cached pages to the kernel. The memory cache is entirely controlled by the kernel and it dictates what should be cached.\n\nA: Disabling disk cache or program cache will only slow down your computer. If you read the whole site that you've linked as source then you would know that is the case and we wouldn't have this discussion. \nHard drive cache and program cache store data in your memory. This makes program startup, usage and opening of files faster. Which it's why you want it. \nThe misunderstanding here (I think) is that you think that it allocates memory and therefor will limit your amount of RAM available. Which is exactly what it doesn't. It takes zero time to clear the cached RAM and fill it with loaded programs. \nSo there is no reason to disable this feature, I don't know if it's even possible since it's integrated in the core of Linux and not a feature of Ubuntu. \nI just want to make clear cache is a good thing, it speeds up many programs and operations, and it's not just Ubuntu and Linux that have this feature. My Windows 7 gaming computer has the same features. \nHaving memory on your computer that isn't doing anything is just a waste of hardware it's not something you want, that's also why caching is a good thing. \n", "Q: Problem with Nvidia after update After adding the most recent set of updates, I can't get into Ubuntu at all.

This will copy all the structure under Brick, too (subdirectories included).  \nOne possibility is using a for loop:\nfor file in /home/security/Brick/*; \ndo\ncp -n $file ~/.gvfs/\"cam on atm-bak-01.local/Brick\"\ndone\n\nOr using find: \nfind /home/security/Brick/ -type f -exec cp -n {} ~/.gvfs/\"cam on atm-bak-01.local/Brick\" \\;\n\nIn this command, -type f says to select files only (no directories), then for each file executes the command specified: {} is substituted by the file name, and \\; is the semicolon needed to close the -exec clause, escaped otherwise the shell will interpret it (and remove). \nThe command after -exec could be whatever you want (for example, instead of cp -n you can use cp -av to copy in archive mode (including timestamps and propriety) and overwriting, or you can use other commands (but: you should understand shell escapes, globbing and quotation before, otherwise you can do a lot of harm --- see for example \"learning the shell\").  \nFind is a very powerful command --- it is worth to be learned well. I have found interesting tutorials here, here and here. \nAbout doing a backup with cp -n:\nNotice that the -n flag will not overwrite existing files, so if you do changes of a file in your local directory that was copied before, it will not be copied again... and you'll have in the backup the old version of it.\nFor that reason I recommend using a backup or sync utility, like Unison or rsync, to do this work. These utilities will just update the changed files, can minimize writes (and so network bandwidth), and are generally much safer. Your backup could be solved with rsync by simply saying:\nrsync -azvv  /home/security/Brick   ~/.gvfs/\"cam on atm-bak-01.local/Brick\"\n\n(take care to not add a final \"/\" at the end --- or rsync will create a subdirectory Brick/Brick. Yes, rsync is powerful and quite temperamental sometime.)\nUnison has a nice graphical interface and will also tell you if there are conflicting changes in your repository --- so this would be my preferred option. \n", "Q: apache2 wont display a folder - while another folder works...confused I am on Ubuntu 13.10 PHP5 and am an intermediate PHP developer\nExact same file (1.php) in 2 diff folders - one works and the other doesnt...\nhttp://localhost/vetpro2/1.php\n\nThe above works as intended...\nhttp://localhost/vetpro/1.php\n\nThe latter gives error:\n\n\"Forbidden - You don't have permission to access /vetpro/1.php on this\n  server.

Here have been a couple of weird experiences I've had with a Ubuntu LiveCD or LiveUSB:\n1) I had one of the original Chromebooks (CR-48). I ended up wiping ChromeOS and installing only Ubuntu 12.04.0 just after it came out. It worked like a charm. About a year later, I broke something and reinstalled Ubuntu using 12.04.3 on a LiveUSB. The LiveUSB worked perfectly - screen resolution, wifi, trackpad all worked fine. I installed it (once installing updates, once stock from the USB drive) and both times screen resolution, wifi, and trackpad all broke.\nI ended up downloading 12.04.0 and installing it then upgrading to 12.04.3 after the fact and everything worked perfectly once again.\n2) I purchased a Toshiba Portege z935 and the LiveUSB worked perfectly, namely the wifi. After install, wifi was extremely slow and basically couldn't load any pages. The answer was that Bluetooth conflicted somehow with wifi and Bluetooth had to be disabled to get wifi to work. Yet both could be enabled in the LiveUSB version, no problem.\nSo my question is, why does this happen? Why does everything work perfectly from the LiveUSB version but then get broken when installed on the system? Is there a different way to install Ubuntu that would allow things to be installed over exactly as they were on the LiveUSB version (drivers, settings, etc)? Are there assumptions that the install makes that I could override somehow?\n\nA: I had a similar experience while installing Ubuntu to a friend of mine. LiveUSB worked out of the box but when Ubuntu booted up he had terrible tearing due to the installed video drivers. His system was unusable.\nSo, my guess is that LiveUSB uses some very generic drivers for all your hardware and they can work averagely well.\nDuring the installation, Ubuntu finds the exact drivers for your hardware and installs them for you to your hard drive. In that way, when you boot up, your hardware communicates with the software with the new drivers, and this may break some things that worked better in LiveUSB.\nDisclaimer: This is a guess and I have no evidence to back it up.\n\nA: In theory you could copy the live media to a hard drive using the ISO as a source and /dev/sdX as destination using dd but then you'd have a live media rather than an installation. I don't think you'd like the end result.\n\nA: The LiveBoot/CD runs on a virtual disk called a RAM disk. Simple way of thinking of it, is that it uses a portion of your RAM as a hard drive (so it is then separated from your actual disks). \nThe actual drivers used will not necessarily be the ones which are installed on the full version LiveBoot will have a \"simpler\" version. When I say this I mean the driver will not be specifically attuned to your machine necessarily rather it will be a generic driver, which would work on \"every\" video card. (Much like when booting into a safe/fallback mode will load drivers which do not have advanced settings). It does this so that compatibility is achieved across a wider variety of computers (as the LiveBoot is intended to be a fully usable system on any machine)\nUpon installing, your OS installation is looking to see what hardware is installed on your system, and what drivers are available for the hardware. It will then install and point your system to those drivers which have been installed.\nPossible Solutions:\nIf you are in process of installing this as a new system (i.e. you don't mind having to experiment to find what will work) you could always try an alternative version to see if the drivers/settings work from this version. \nPossible Alternative: You could do a server install, and install only what you need, however this will require research, and might be a little overwhelming, as well as un-needed.\nAs for answers below (as I am writing this), they all could be combined together to make one answer possibly.\nSome other things you may wish to look at/think about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a LiveCD from scratch, or LiveCD customization if you know the drivers from the LiveCD, you may be able to customize a LiveCd for your personal usage (and change the driver's being installed).\n\n*(As per \"How To\" for ElderGeek's Answer regarding putting the LiveBoot on a physical disk) You would need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Partition for your LiveCD image (make it bootable)\n\n*Use dd to put your LiveBoot .iso onto your new partition (example formatting would be dd if=/dev/sdc1/nameof.iso of=/dev/sda1/) Check man dd as there are different options that dd can be used with.\n\n*Manipulate your GRUB settings to point to your partition containing your LiveBoot (in terminal type info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration' and read) I doubt that sudo grub-mkconfig will pick it up as an operating system.\n\n*Look at this (On how to make the LiveBoot information persistent) You will need to change everywhere USB is to where your partition is.\n\n*Doing this you may/will still have issues with things such as hibernation, or any other issues with LiveCD. \n\n\n*It may just be easier loading the LiveBoot/CD determining what drivers are being used, (lsmod, or cat /proc/modules to find some information) and try to use those on the installed version instead. \n\nA: Two things RAM and drivers. Since LiveCD runs off of RAM that might be a problem. Also drivers and actual hardware conflicts. The LiveCD isn't actually installed on the computer, you're booting off of it. That's why hibernate doesn't work when I installed Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Ethernet works with live CD, but doesn't after fresh install. I just installed 13.10 on a dell laptop.  During the install process it connected to the ethernet.  Once install finished and I logged in for the first time I did not have ethernet.  \nIt has the Broadcom BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX ethernet controller.\nWhen doing ifconfig I don't see an eth0.\n\nA: I had the same exact issue with a Broadcom 440x adapter in a Dell Vostro 1000 (64-bit AMD install).\nThe CD installer showed satisfaction of the three requirements/recommendations after booting from the CD (the Dell 1390 wireless adapter was a BUST before, during and after the install, so I had to plug-in to pass the third recommendation of internet access).  I installed 12.04.3 just fine and then after the post-install reboot, it even tells me I have 202 updates.\nThen the real insanity begins.  Trying to do anything else (including the updates) cannot happen b/c either the wired adapter is now MIA or any use of same causes the wired connection to drop (be it to actually perform the updates, or maybe launching Firefox).  I see that the Broadcom (wired and also for the Dell 1390 WiFi) network adapters have been a TOTAL NIGHTMARE for YEARS now with Ubuntu (and just about every other distro), and apparently no one has been able to fix this in the 13 beta either.\nchili555's suggested command, above, yielded the following on my particular system:\n05:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN [14e4:4311] (rev 01)\n08:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX [14e4:170c] (rev 02)\n\nIn addition, the AirPort wanna-be icon in the menubar says that \"No network devices are available\" which is puzzling, since wired worked to find the updates it says are available. Maybe the LiveCD brilliance can be maintained to stop the final install from breaking itself after first boot, so we can actually remedy the issue without needing another computer just to get an Ubuntu install working? \nNOTE: Both wired and wireless work flawlessly in Windows using the Dell drivers (before and between Ubuntu installation attempts, and I overwrote any current OS in each case), so this was not malfunctioning hardware or any other nonsense.\nI hawked every bit of the install in these later install tests, and, apparently, during installation, the wired connection drops well after (I had walked away each time prior and did not notice this) hitting \"Continue\" on the 2nd installation screen (with the three recommendations, plus update downloads and proprietary software install options - both checked in my cases).  It is re-enabled on the 3rd screen (or after hitting \"Back\", only to go back out after hitting Continue again, until the 3rd screen is again loaded, and wired comes back).  It does this again late in the install while \"Installing system\".  Each disabling/enabling increments the interface, such that it is assigned as eth#, where # is the number of times it goes out and comes back on), with the lowest possible being eth3.  The driver in use is b44.\nThat aside, I was able to get wired networking to persist, and even wireless working, as follows (after finishing the installation and rebooting):\n1) Delete the duplicative eth# entries, via /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules, and toggle networking off and on (now it's using eth0).\n2) Go to the Additional Drivers tool (it sometimes pops-up on its own; otherwise, top right corner gear icon-->System Settings...-->Additional Drivers) and after it searches for drivers (get a coffee or two at the rate it searches), it'll find and want you to activate Broadcom STA.  Click the \"Activate\" button, and although the activation fails (due to the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf entry for \"bcm43xx\", which is made known by the /var/log/jockey.log referenced in the error) the wired connection comes on and stays on (at least for the critical purposes of apt-get, next)!\n3) Run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get remove bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\nsudo modprobe b43\n\nNOTE: Although some say to install both b43-fwcutter and the above, b43-fwcutter showed as installed on my system after the above (sudo dpkg --get-selections | grep b43), so I just used the above as-is.\nI discovered the first two commands, above, via the following BUG report (yes, really bad configs/changes from autoupdates or clean installs are bugs, contrary to the closing of this one as otherwise!):\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1113779 \n4) HALLELUJAH!  Clicking the Airport-looking icon now shows both wired and wireless options. If it reports the WiFi switch being set to off, the fn+F2 keys (or whatever switch you have on your own system should) work to turn it on to see and connect (wlan0) to any available APs (as per the comments, below, get really close, as in physically within 10', to any APs!).  Wired should already be up, but if not, then select \"Auto Ethernet\" or \"Wired connection 1\" for/from same and voila (it's even still eth0)!\nSadly, WiFi connections are not persistent between reboots (WiFI is not disabled via \"switch\" - it just seems to go dormant).  WiFi knows of my APs, but simply will not connect until I plug-in via the wired interface.  WiFI then immediately finds and connects to a known WiFI AP, similar to firing-up the Additional Drivers tool...did I mention \"bug\" yet?!\nHopefully I'm through the worst of this saga, and this detailed explanation helps the next person avoid similar frustrations, at least until (unless?) this mess gets fixed properly.  I see posts on Broadcom issues going back quite a few releases, although 12.04 (just my luck/timing!) seems to be more problematic than most.  I'm using it b/c it is the current LTS release.\nUPDATE\nSee the comments, but...\nAnother related mystery - why does the Additional Drivers tool keep wanting me to activate Broadcom STA wireless?!  If I do, it fails as soon as it tries to download (jockey.log error, even though I was connected fine prior) and that knocks wireless completely out of the menu bar Airport icon, until I do a sudo modprobe b43, but then I have to walk back within 10' of the AP to get it to (re)connect.\nJust to confirm, this is not a hardware issue - with Windows (XP or Vista) and the Dell driver(s) I can be in the backyard and (re)connect to my AP even after any (re)boot, but these flaky Broadcom drivers for Linux are apparently missing something significant in terms of its searching for and (re)connecting to an AP from a disconnected state (disable, reboot, etc.).  Perhaps it's a b vs. g issue or maybe the radio is on low-power state or some other related nonsense??\nThankfully this is a WiFi laptop and not a desktop, so I can walk it back towards the AP to let it (re)connect and then go anywhere any of my other devices can go, but it's still a major PiTA of an issue.\n", "Q: Error while am try to update it W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/plushuang-tw/uget-stable/ubuntu/dists/saucy/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, E:Some index files failed to download.

I did this so that any crashes in an OS would not cause data loss\nThe windows system also took up one primary partition for system, and I have only 4 MBR slots. Effectively I have no primary partition for SWAP. I do not know it happened earlier, but back then I had a partition for swap as well\nMy CURRENT disk partitioning looks like this: http://imgur.com/YMTr879\n\nHow can I create swap in my current setup?\n\nA: First, swap space doesn't generally result in significant speed increases. Swap space is used when RAM fills up, so it enables you to run more programs in a limited amount of RAM. Because disk access is slower than RAM access, by the time you need swap for this purpose, your system's speed will start to decline. Swap space is also used by suspend-to-disk operations, and for that purpose, you need at least as much swap space as you've got RAM. (That said, because Linux uses RAM for disk caches, putting little-used data in swap space can result in more disk-cache use, which can increase speed just a little, so there can be some speed benefit to having swap. I don't have any benchmark data handy, but AFAIK this effect is usually pretty small.)\nSecond, you can convert partitions from primary to logical form with my FixParts program, which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu. See the FixParts Web page for more information and documentation. You may need to resize at least one partition using GParted to make this conversion, but you'd need to do this to create new partitions anyhow, so that's probably not too big a hurdle.\nFinally, the 4-primary-partition limit applies to the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system. The newer GUID Partition Table (GPT) system has a limit of 128 partitions by default, and that value can be raised. GPT doesn't use extended or logical partitions. My hunch is that you're using MBR, since if your computer is booting Windows from the disk you show, it would need an EFI System Partition (ESP) to boot from a GPT disk, and your screen shot shows no hint of such a partition. Thus, I don't think that this paragraph really applies to you. I mention it on the off chance that your screen shot is incomplete or misleading, and for the benefit of other readers with a similar question who might be using GPT.\n\nA: You can check this link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/9092/importance-of-swap-partition \nAnd This:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nBest Wishes :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touchscreen on Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro Does anyone have any experience with Ubuntu running on the Yoga 2 Pro in terms of the functionality of the touchscreen?\n\nA: I'm trying out Ubuntu via a live usb on the Yoga 13 right now.\nThe Yoga 2 Pro is the reboot of that device.\nAnyway, the are no issues with the touchscreen for me on 13.10.\nThe buttons seem no smaller than they are in Windows, so there's that.\nI haven't installed the driver to enable wifi, but purchased a $10 Edimax usb adapter that is doing the trick. \nPinch-to-zoom isn't there (bummer), but the grab and drag addon for Firefox makes it pleasant to navigate the Internet by touch.\nThere are addons like that for Chrome as well.\n\nA: The touchscreen is working, but it's not really practical.  Because of the extreme display resolution, the buttons are far too small to use a finger.  At 1080 they are a bit more functional.  Also in chrome the touchscreen can't do anything.\nThe onscreen keyboard \"Onboard\" works just fine, and is arguably a better touch keyboard than Windows 8.\nSo yes, the hardware is working perfectly.  But the user interface doesn't support it very well.  I'm hoping that this improves in the future.\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed on the Yoga 2 Pro and in KDE, I adjusted a few things and am very happy with that now. I don't really have any problems with the high resolution anymore, so instead of decreasing it, I can enjoy my full res.\nThe touchscreen works ok in normal laptop mode (I am not using (K)Ubuntu in tablet mode really, since I work in the terminal, but e.g. I can't scroll in firefox as in pushing the page up- or downwards. This kinda bugs me.\n\nA: I found 2 touch gestures. 1 is to double tap with 3 fingers to window switch. It's a bit hard for me to switch but you'll probably get the hang of it. And the second gesture is to hold three fingers on the screen. Now you can drag three fingers across the screen to drag the current window.\nSome things to make things better for touchscreen are to keep the unity interface. Or use gnome 3 as it has something like the Mac OSX launchpad (Which is like the Unity dash). The best thing is to get Chrome. It lets you scroll with touchscreen. And as far as I know about emulated right clicks. Touching and holding the screen with 1 finger makes a right click menu appear, with buttons big enough for fingers. The Ubuntu touch keyboard and the touch keyboard for Chrome adds a good experience.\nAnd the unity launcher on the left has buttons big enough for touchscreen. The dash looks like it's touchscreen optimized. Is that enough info?\n\nA: I'm running 13.10 on the yoga pro, the touch screen is working but if you do not tweak the settings for the high resolution screen it is hard to navigate using the screen. \nIn addition to the hidpi problem that can partly be resolved, you will also have a problem when using the yoga in tablet mode. The keyboard is switched off but the touch pad is not. Moreover, if you rotate the screen 90 degrees, the touch screen is not rotated (you will have to change x configurations to solve this, have not done so myself yet).\n", "Q: Dual boot (Win 7 & Ubuntu 13.10 clock problem I'm a \"newbie\" to Ubuntu, but I've been wrestling with this problem for several hours and don't seem to be able to solve it: When I set the time in Windows (Indianapolis, Eastern U.S. time zone) and then re-boot to Ubuntu, the computer time goes to Hawaiian time.\nWhen the time is set in Ubuntu, and the computer is rebooted to Windows the time is advanced by 5 hours.\nI've set the time in the BIOS, and it seems to make no difference. I've tried setting the time from \"automatic\" to \"manual\", all with the same result.\nNot a big problem, but it shows some underlying glitch.\nCould anyone explain?\n\nA: It is because Linux stores time as UTC and windows as Local.\nYou can make Linux use local time or Windows use UTC.\nTo make Linux use local time edit /etc/default/rcS and change UTC=yes to UTC=no\nTo make Windows use UTC, create a new file named UTC.reg with the following content:\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation]\n\"RealTimeIsUniversal\"=dword:00000001\n\nand open it with regedit in windows.\n", "Q: Partitions are gone I know this question has been asked many no.of times & I'm asking again please don't mark it as duplicate.

I hope you people can help me & save me from embracement. Eagerly waiting for your responses.\n\nA: Do not install Windows first. That will overwrite more files, reducing the chance you'll be able to recover your files. Instead, use photorec from the testdisk package while running Ubuntu from a live USB.

I'm using the default xorg drivers but the fan is always at a continuous speed.\nMy laptop is a Dell Insprion 15 and my video card is an Radeon HD 7730M. How can I control the fans?\n\nA: The continuously-high fan speed problem comes from a power management problem. Indeed, \n\nWith the radeon driver, power saving is disabled by default and has to be enabled manually if desired.\n\n(source : Archlinux wiki)\nThe default PM mode is \"profile\", which is set to \"default\". More info on those at X.org's RadeonFeature/KMS Power Management Options.\nI don't know which version of Ubuntu you are using, so I'll assume based on the date of your post that you're trying to run Ubuntu 13.10, which would be better since the method I'm going to give you only works with kernel 3.11 (used by default in Saucy/13.10).\nLinux kernel 3.11 introduces Dynamic Power Management (dpm) method with the Radeon/ATI libre driver, which \"should greatly help power consumption, especially when idle\" (source: RadeonDriver Ubuntu Community Wiki).\nMore specifically, \"dpm\" mode\n\nuses hardware on the GPU to dynamically change the clocks and voltage based on GPU load. It also enables clock and power gating.\n\n(Source : X.org RadeonFeature/KMS Power Management Options)\nIt is only supported on R6xx and newer asics, which \"luckily\" is your case (too recent cards are not well supported by libre drivers, see Feature Matrix for Free Radeon Drivers -- you can get the development name of your card by running in a terminal lspci |grep VGA).\nHow to use it\nFirst of all, make sure you completely uninstalled fglrx : see Removing the proprietary fglrx driver (Ubuntu Wiki).\nThen to enable it, you just have to edit /etc/default/grub and add radeon.dpm=1 to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line, so it would look something like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.dpm=1\"\n\nAfter you save/quit the text editor, update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nModes\nThere are 3 operation modes to choose from:\n\n\n*\n\n*battery: lowest power consumption\n\n*balanced: sane default\n\n*performance: highest performance\n\n\nThey can be changed via sysfs:\nsudo bash -c \"echo \\\"battery\\\" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state\n\n(source : Archlinux wiki)\nTips if you use GNOME Shell\nThere is a GNOME Shell extension (forked from the previously mentioned one by StuntsPT) that implements support for dpm modes management : you can find it here. To use it, simply download the master zip file (direct link) and use Tweak Tool to install AND enable it. Alternatively, extract the extension folder from the zip file and put it in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions. The extension will then show up in Tweak tool which you can use to enable the extension. If it doesn't appear in the top panel, try to restart the shell with Alt+F2 r (enter).\nIf you don't use GNOME Shell, I guess you're stuck with the manual/terminal editing of /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state.\nNote: my answer aims at addressing only the fan speed problem with the libre radeon driver. Due to the novelty of your card, radeon may lack some features and your overall graphic performances be a bit hindered. But still better than a non-booting/overheating machine, isn't it? :-) Otherwise, you have the option to use the non-libre driver as suggested in the first comment to your question.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Translation in fon I want to translate Ubuntu in fon (my language).

I think that option simply runs the installer without running a desktop environment.\nI suggest you check the md5sum of the iso you downloaded\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes\nAlso, what version of Xubuntu?\n", "Q: How to remove bottom programms bar I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.

I have 6 gb of ram, 1TB hard drive, and a 3.3GHZ dual core processer (just in case it matters).\nI've managed to figure some things out. I've burned the ubuntu files onto a DVD, and I have been able to successfully run it off the disk. I also shrunk my Windows partition by 120Gb and partitioned that for Ubuntu (all using the windows Disk Manager).\nProblems:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I turn my computer on with the DVD in the tray, the computer cant find windows. it flashes a screen real quick that says something about not being able to find an operating system, and then goes to \"grub\" and asks what i want to do with Ubuntu. this scares me, because I don't know if that means that I will  not be able to boot windows if I install Ubuntu.\n\n*The Ubuntu 13.10 installer does not detect my Windows operating system. I only have the options to Erase everything on my drive, or \"something else.\"\nI choose that, which brings me to 3\n\n*I don't understand the partition table. I have no idea which drive im selecting to install stuff on, much less which one to select. I tried to tell by the amount of memory partitioned off, but none of the numbers seem to be accurate. Plus, all the names are dev/sda(#). I know Ubuntu knows the name of my partition, because on the sidebars it shows the names of the different drives, including the partition I made; so why don't they use the names? I have no idea what I'm going to be erasing. I've read that I should know which is which by the file system type, but they are all NTFS, including the one I made. my only other option was FAT, none for EXT2 or any of that like people said to do.\nMy main concerns are that of accidentally erasing windows or not being able to access windows. any feasible solution is helpful, weather it helps me with the install or to make Ubuntu see windows.\nI realize this question has been asked much, but i have found no feasible answers so far. I am relatively new to this, and have never installed an operating system before, so I do not know most of the jargon. please keep it relatively simple, please. I am not a programmer.\nThanks.\nEdit: So, thanks to several of the comments and my increasing comprehension of Linux and installing operating systems from reading lots of articles, I finally managed to install Linux. \nWhat I had to do is, first, delete the partition I had made on windows. Once I deleted it, I put in the boot disk in and ran it. I then proceeded to run GParted by using the buil in search. I found on there the free space from the deleted partition, so I knew where my windows is was NOT. I then made 3 partitions. 1gb for booting, in case I needed that to make it be able to actually dual boot,6gb for swap, cause I have 6gb of ram, and 110gb for the OS storage. \nThen I went to the installer, and this time I was able to tell what was what from the amounts of storage it told me. I selected the appropriate ones, set boot and os to ext4 and swap to the swap type, set it to format what it needed to and set the is mount point to /.\nI proceeded with the installation and it worked. \nNow I have a new problem, when it boots, it defaults to windows and I can't open Ubuntu. But I'll make another topic for that. \n\nA: The first thing I'd do would be to do a Repair Install of Windows.\nYou'll want to boot on your Windows installation CD. At some point, you will have the choice to repair your installation.\nThis guide seems to explain the steps quite well: \nhttp://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/start-the-windows-7-recovery-environment/\nIf it doesn't work, maybe you could give us some sort of screenshot of your partition table to see if it looks messed up.\nEDIT: If you don't have your Windows installation disk, try this solution: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/create-a-system-repair-disc\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation always restarts I downloaded ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso and mounted it to USB.

The problem is during the next Ubuntu Install screen. For some reason there is no option to \"Install Ubuntu Server\" or even Check CD for defects. Only the last three options are available. Why are those options not available? Is there a way for me to install Ubuntu Server?\nI'm trying to install the server on an old Acer Laptop with 1GB of RAM, and 2.2GHz AMD processor.

So now just root has the permission to read and traverse it, and the group www-data can traverse it, but not read it... which means that noone but root can read the files in the filesystems, and normally the root account is disabled in Ubuntu. \nIt is possible to reverse what you have done for sure. The only problem is that you have to remember/detect where your partitions where; if you have not this information, you can use gparted to see where you root and home partition are.\nI will suppose here that the system was installed with the root partition in /dev/sda2, adapt this to your case. It is a bit more complex if you have a separate /home partition. A\nBoot with a live USB or CD. Choose \"Try the system\" and then, from a terminal: \n1) go to superuser mode: (normally I wouldn't advise doing this, but you'll have to do quite a lot of things and using sudo in this case doesn't help a lot).  \nsudo -i \n\n2) mount the real drive of your system (adapt with your root partition) \nmkdir /myroot\nmount /dev/sda2 /myroot\n\n3) re-do the root directory permission/owner \nchown root.root /myroot\nchmod 755 /myroot\n\n4) do the same for /home: (if /home is on another partition, mount it under /myroot/home)\nchown root.root /myroot/home\nchmod 755 /myroot/home\n\nThat should undo what you did --- I hope you didn't change permission recursively.

Probably a lot of problems arises from the fact that something is failing in your shell startup files and you have an half-baked environment up. So this is a wild guess, you should check with the support of the virtualenv thing you have.\nDisclaimer: if you have installed things forcing the installation (you or some script) this can disrupt your system. \nI would try to do the following: \n1) try to see if it is automatically fixable: \nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n2) If this fails, try to see if you have \"held\" packages: \napt-mark showhold \n\n3) if you have, un-hold them with:\nsudo apt-mark unhold <package name> \n\nAnd then repeat the step 1. \nAfter that, probably the best thing you can do is removing all the packages that are creating problems with \nsudo apt-get remove <package> \n\nor even (you have played around with configuration files) \nsudo apt-get purge <package>\n\nand then reinstall them with sudo apt-get install. I would do this at least with the packages that give you error: \npython-pip python-virtualenv gimp virtualenvwrapper ubuntu-system-service\n\nand probably zsh too --- probably you'll have to remove/rename the .zshrc, .zlogin, .zshenv files too (if some installation script has modified them, reinstalling zsh will not change files in your home dir).

I'm attempting to setup juju-gui in a VM running Ubuntu 13.10 x64 Server.\nI intend to see if it's possible to deploy an openstack \"all in one\" node, using this method in that particular VM.\nI've installed and bootstrapped juju in a local environment :\nsudo apt-get install juju-core\nsudo apt-get install juju-local\njuju switch local\nsudo juju bootstrap\n\nNext I've executed the following :\njuju deploy juju-gui\njuju expose juju-gui\nwatch juju status\n\nI was expecting to see juju-gui open up some ports and become available via a web-browser but nothing like that happened - why? how do I fix that? I believe I've managed to follow the deployment guides to the letter?\nAre there any detailed walkthroughs regarding deploying openstack on 13.10, using juju?\n\nA: The last thing you did \"juju watch status\" is a bit off.  It should call the \"watch\" command on \"juju status\", i.e \nwatch juju status\n\n(That just runs juju status periodically and shows the results.)\nAfter a while, the juju-gui portion of the status output will show the agent-state as \"started\" and display a public IP address. \nAt that point you can open your browser and go to the IP address.  You'll be prompted for a password, which is the 'admin-secret' found in your ~/.juju/environments.yaml under the \"local\" section.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Expose doesn't do anything in the local provider. There are no firewalls rules in place like other providers such as ec2. Once you deploy the juju-gui and it's started, you should be able to visit it via the ip address for the lxc machine that juju status shows you. \nIt is available on port 80 and 443. \nIf it did not come up to \"started\" state then please ssh to that machine and grab the log for the unit in /var/log/juju/unit-* and let us know. \n", "Q: Cinnamon broke Unity and KDE on Ubuntu 13.10 Something after installing Cinnamon has screwed up my ability to use Unity and KDE on Ubuntu 13.10.

As the title suggests, I recently decided to make the switch from Windows 8(It came installed in the laptop) to Ubuntu. I've gone through pretty much all of the steps to dual-boot Ubuntu with Windows 8. I made a bootable USB and manged to get the installer started. I didn't want to have to make my own partitions as I don't really know how to, and I don't want to mess up my laptop. the tutorial I was using said that the installer would see that I already had an OS and would give me the option to dual boot. the only thing I needed to do was set how much space I wanted Ubuntu to have.\nEverything went smoothly until it came to that part. When I got to that screen, it said it couldn't find any other OS's. The only option now is to either get it to find Windows 8, or to manually partition, which I'd rather not do.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nPS.here's the website tutorial I followed(I double checked on other sites too):\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tired-of-windows-8-how-to-dual-boot-windows-ubuntu/\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: A lot of people are reporting that the \"install alongside\" option doesn't work on computers that ship with Windows 8.

Any suggestions I truly would appreciate it.\nthanks in advance\n\nA: I had trouble with the same type of system.  What finally got me working was to disable the acceleration support in the nouveau driver.  Via sudo, I edited /etc/defaults/grub so that:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nBecame:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nouveau.noaccel=1\"\n\nAnd then:\nsudo update-grub\n\nI restarted the machine, and the graphics issues were resolved.  Admittedly, I'm disabling the acceleration support - but I'd rather have slow correct graphics than fast incorrect ones.\nIn my case, the issue was that I'd have color corruption (in some cases, full white out) on icons and in terminals.  At first I tried disabling the display compositing (Settings Manager -> Window Manager Tweaks -> Compositor).  That helped a bit, but I still saw numerous issues.\nI attempted to figure a way to install the nvidia driver, but my understanding is that I need the 96.43 one.  The .run file from nvidia doesn't work for newer kernels, and I gave up on that approach after a while.  I attempted to find a repository with a recent 96.43 package, but had no luck.  My guess is that folks have better things to do with their time than update packages for drivers that support cards that are roughly a decade old...\nAlong the way, though, I had noticed that rdesktop had no display problems.  I figured that the code there likely wasn't calling for acceleration, so I figured it was worth trying to disable it.\n", "Q: reinstall windows 8 on clean ubuntu hard drive For a moth ago, I took a clean install of Ubuntu 13.10, I formated the entire hard drive that contained windows 8 and installed Ubuntu.

I installed the restricted Nvidia drivers with the command:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nSince then, after I enter my password and log in (the login screen itself works perfectly),   I get a black screen with the cursor and nothing happens from that point onwards.\nBasically, what I would like to know is how to get back to the normal Ubuntu desktop and (hopefully) still be able to use Nvidia drivers.\n\nA: Like the first answer removing the xorg.conf file will reset your \"driver-setup\".\nBut I've had this problem or one very similar myself. The problem lay in Optimus, a nvidia technology that allows the user to switch back and forth between integrated and nvidia graphics in order to safe power.\nNow I'm assuming now that you've got optimus, if not that you can ignore this solution. \nYou can install a program called Bumblebee that installs and manages your graphical drivers including Optimus.\nto install (make sure to purge your current-nvidia settings before!!):\n sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\nthen reboot\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nthen after crossing your finger and a succesfull login. You can run programs using nvidia graphics using the optirun command:\noptirun yourprogramnamehere\n\nthere you have it Optimus working and running.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and after searching for hours i got the solutions. Problem was, that due to installation of some software's like opencv it automatically installed nvidia drivers/graphics on NON-NVIDIA machine and due to this screen goes blank. So Just follow these simple steps to get your desktop screen back:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1\n\n*Provide Login details.\n\n*Type in  terminal:\n\n\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\n       sudo reboot\n\nDone!\n\nA: I am running dual 660Ti cards, with sli,and dual monitors.

This should be equal to the sum of those 4 partition's sizes: 650.3 + 3.862 + 16.06 + 21.07.\n\n*the first logical partition in that extended partition is your D: partition, which has 681897984 blocks of size 681897984 / 1024 / 1024 = 650.3 GB\n\n\nSo, everything is just like Windows has reported. The only thing that the Windows failed to report to you is that your 4 partitions (from D: to the right) are all grouped INSIDE one extended partition (due to the max 4 primary partitions limitation) and that's why Ubuntu is showing you the total size of all the logical partitions inside it (691.3 GB).\nUsing GParted (or PartedMagic) shows all of this in a nice graphical way, so please try it (just make a bootable usb with GParted on it and reboot your machine and use it).\n", "Q: Extract numerical value from string I want to extract the numerical value out of the below command output :\nbash-3.2# psrinfo -pv | head -1\nThe physical processor has 1 virtual processor (0)\n\nThat is, the output should be \"1\".\nCan someone provide me any commands or a small script to do that?\n\nA: You can use the cut-command to do what you need.\n$ psrinfo -pv | head -1 | cut -f 5 -d ' '\n1\n\n-f 5 means the 5-th field, and -d ' ' means use space as field delimiter.\n", "Q: Need help with old data and Ubuntu installation to replace Windows entirely I have Windows Desktop which I am using from a very long time.

What I mean by this is I want to replace the whole windows 7 OS with the latest version of Ubuntu.\nI have never used Linux before in my life at all but have started developing an interest in it. \nMy exact question is if in case I happen to install Ubuntu on my C: drive will I be able to access all my data on all the other drives as the data available on all other drives is extremely important for me and I cannot afford to loose it on any circumstances.\nIf not, then what are the steps to accomplish the same and an information if it is critical.\nOn the other hand I cannot backup the entire data as it happens to be about 1 TB.\nAny help in this case is welcomed and appreciated.\n\nA: First up, you have to back up. What happens if your computer gets stolen, or dropped, or there's a power surge, flood or fire?\nSecondly, yes, just erase the primary drive and all others will be untouched.\n\nA: If the data are stored in a different drive, Ubuntu won't delete them and they'll be accessible from the system once installed. Just be sure you select the right drive and partition during the installation process.\nOne advice: In GNU/Linux, there's no C: and D: units. When you start the installation it will ask you which device do you want to use. The names follow the scheme /dev/sda, sdb, sdc... etc where a, b and c are different drives, and partitions you may have are for example sda1, sda2, etc.  You could try to boot from an installation DVD and see what partitions and drives you have, and which ones contains the  windows system and the data you want to keep. Don't worry, the installer won't delete anything without asking you a confirmation so you can safely have a look and install or decide to reboot to windows if you're not sure.\nFor the rest, there's plenty of guides online for installing Ubuntu, like the official one here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation\n", "Q: How do I run rdesktop in a new x session?

I know there is a work around to stop windows from doing this but I'm not interested in that as it is a messy hack.\nAlso dont't suggest EasyBCD or Visual BCD because these programs do not work with GPT yet (as far as I'm aware).\nSo the only route I think I can take is to manually enter the information into the BCD store (which is now in the unmapped EFI partition) using bcdedit but i'm not sure how to do this. I did get this working once before by copying the windows boot MANAGER entry and editing it for Ubuntu, but when i tried to do that again it didn'twork so i must be missing something.\n\nA: There is no known way until now for adding a foreign, non-Windows UEFI/EFI loader to be chain loaded by Windows boot manager (Windows 7/8).\nRegarding Visual BCD Editor - it is UEFI capable. You can create UEFI loaders for Windows 7/8.\nChain loading foreign, non-Windows OSs is possible for MBR disk scheme. You use a so called boot sector loader chaining over partition boot sector or MBR code of foreign system.

I read similar, but unanswered questions involving what I'd like to do.\nI have an ancient Dell desktop running XP to which I've added a second hard drive.  Both drives are only 40GB each, so there is little room to crowd two OS on one drive.  I had been using the second drive for backup/storage, but I'd like to put Ubuntu on it and have dual boot available. I have Pangolin ISO on CD. My BIOS boot sequence options show CD-ROM, but not my DVD drive (added later - not factory) and PP is the latest distro that fits on a CD.\nMy proposal: \nReformat and wipe the second drive. \nSet blank drive to boot first in BIOS.\nUbuntu should show no OS and I can safely let it install GRUB and OS on the second drive automatically without worry of ruining XP or partitioning incorrectly.\nLet Ubuntu drive remain first to boot and GRUB will give boot option.\nAny glaring holes in this plot?  I am a noob and worried about screwing up partitioning.  I was hoping this would be the simplest method, but my ignorance may be showing here.  I don't care about default boot order.\nSpecific questions:  Will I be able to share data between the two OS with this method?  Not critical, but I'd like to be able to at least copy stored data back and forth between them.  After running the LIVE session of Ubuntu to rescue data from a Vista corruption crash on my laptop, I've seen my Win HDD mounted in Ubuntu, but will XP see my Ubuntu drive and let me access it?  \nI've only recently started playing with Linux distros, but I am amazed by what can be done.

Most impressive.\nEDIT_____________________________________________\nOkay.  When I go to install, I have only two options from Ubuntu.  Replace XP and install 12.04, or \"Something Different\".  Since I want to keep XP on sda, I must format the partitions on sdb myself.  This is where I'm like a kid on a high dive who's hesitant to jump.  I've read a lot of different things, but most involve partitioning for both OS on the same drive.  I want to leave sda alone (except for GRUB install) and partition sdb for Ubuntu.  I have 40GB HD and 750MB of RAM.  I know that I need a swap area, a root partition, and then a space for Ubuntu files. I'd like to be able to share files between OS if possible.  Do I need to make some changes to the sda partition to do that?\nThis is what I think I need to do to sdb.  Please let me know if you see anything that I should change.\nPrimary - 1000 MB - Beginning - Swap\nPrimary - 10,000 MB - Beginning - ext4 - /\nPrimary - 28,700 MB - Beginning - ext4 - /home\nThe last part is the remainder of free space after the first two.  Drive reads 39,700 MB actual size.  From what I read, swap should roughly equal RAM and something I read led me to believe that 10GB would be a good size for root.\nSorry for the spoon-feeding request, but any advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Using two hard drives is one of the easiest ways of dual booting. They will probably show as sda and sdb.\nThere is no need to wipe the second hard drive because Linux will format it as part of the installation. You just need to point Ubuntu at the partition you want it to install into.\nYou should let Grub2 to install on the MBR of DISK ONE, the Windows one. THe MBR is a tiny bit of the hard dist and you should have no problem. \n", "Q: How to disable powerbutton in 13.10 minimal?

Instead, create the file somewhere else and use \ndesktop-file-install <your_file.desktop>\n\nto add the file.\nE.g. you create ~/myapp.desktop and do \ndesktop-file-install --dir=$HOME/.local/share/applications ~/myapp.desktop\n\nExisting files of the same name will be overwritten and unity updated, you can use --delete-original if the source is not needed anymore, or\nsudo desktop-file-install ~/myapp.desktop\n\nto install it for all users.\n\nA: According with this answer (and you can find many others in the same sense), unfortunately there seems to be no command to let the unity-applications-daemon refresh its application cache.

I am not familiar with this brand although it seems to me they produce Ubuntu laptop with good performance. The price listed on their website is also not that expensive as compared with a MacBook Pro, or ThinkPad T series, or the Dell XPS Developer Edition\nThus I hope to ask your opinions before buying. Has anyone used System76 Ubuntu Laptop? How is the experience. Is it worth to put the money on? I plan to invest $1k for a new laptop. Or even if it is not, would you recommend some other good brands?\n\nA: If you want opinions , I can say on behalf of all System76 users that They are working awesome even after years.\nIf you want to see those users opinions here we go their google plus post which filled with opinions.\n\nhttps://plus.google.com/104919222657565747428/posts/XRmZ8y5pvmY\n", "Q: Changing the name of an application in Dash I have two versions of a wine program. Curently, they are named the same. I would like to change their name form \"Program name\" to \"Program name vesion.number\".\nThese programs have their .desktop files in ~.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/.\nWhen I edit them and change the name attribute in the desktop file, nothing happens. (I remove and install leafpad all over to force some cache updating).\nWhen I rename the \"Program name.desktop\" files to for example \"Program nameAAA.desktop\", the name in the dash changes. when I rename them back, it reverts to the original.\nI can live with \"Program nameAAA.desktop\" but I still wonder why this happens? I suspect some cache somewhere.\n\nA: You can use this old application to also edit the entries in your Dash:\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/saucy/alacarte/\nYou can also get it by running this command in a terminal sudo apt-get install alacarte\nI use this program even though it was meant for older releases of Ubuntu, and you had the old \"Main Menu\" with different categories. However, i thinks it's the easiest way to edit and add programs to your Ubuntu Dash! Just find your application, select it, press properties and then you can change the name, description and icon. \nPlease note that this program doesn't add an oldschool menu, but only includes the entries from the main menu into the Ubuntu Dash also, so don't get fooled by how it looks. Also, categories aren't used in the Ubuntu Dash either, so setting these has no effect.\nHope this is helpful! \n\nA: I concluded this is a bug in the end.\n", "Q: wrong linux-headers-server version On my Ubuntu 12.04 server I get the message that linux-server depends on linux-headers-server 3.2.0.55.65 but 3.2.0.56.66 is installed.\nThe suggested apt-get -f install won't work.\nmy sources.list:\n    # deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120424.1)]/ dists/precise/main/binary-i386/\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120424.1)]/ dists/precise/restricted/binary-i386/\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120424.1)]/ precise main restricted\n\n#deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120424.1)]/ dists/precise/main/binary-i386/\n#deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120424.1)]/ dists/precise/restricted/binary-i386/\n#deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120424.1)]/ precise main restricted\n\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\ndeb http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted\ndeb-src http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted\n\n## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the\n## distribution.\ndeb http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\n\n## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu\n## team.

I am not saying that Windows is better because in fact I love Ubuntu; but I don't want to buy a new battery which could present the same problem. \nApologize my English, I am an ignorant on this and that's the reasong why I'm asking; thanks so much\n\nA: Different operating systems put different loads on the battery at different times. Although, in general, Linux uses less power overall, it could be asking your machine to do multiple things at once which generate a greater load from the battery. The Linux load shows your battery's capacity is declining, and me, I have no doubt, the problem will appear with Windows 8 soon, for certain.\n", "Q: Switching between English and Swedish keyboard on Ubuntu 13.04 How can I switch between English and Swedish keyboard on my Ubuntu 13.04?\n\nA: Click on the system settings.\nSelect keyboard icon\nThere is a link at the down left of the window called \"Layout Settings\"\nClick + to add the input source layout \nSelect Swedish from the list and Click Add button.\nThere is also a checkbox to display the input source at the system tray and a shortcut at the same window.\n", "Q: ffmpeg how to output images from a video I want to extract images from a video \nI want thous images to be extracted from specific time for example 0:30 1:15 1:45 and I would love them to be in PNG format as well \nThank you in advanced \nUpdate\nThank you rechengehirn and Rmano Sadly I can not except both of your answer and I selected it randomly sorry for that but  I thought it would be fair like that because both of your answers work so Thank you again \n\nA: This works for me:\nffmpeg -i input_movie.mp4 -ss 00:00:05 -f image2 -vframes 1 imagename.png\n\nWhere the options are:\n-i              > The input video file\n-ss  00:00:05   > Start at Second 5 of movie\n-f image2       > Force image output\n-vframes 1      > Set the number of video frames to record\n\nYou can read the ffmpeg documentation on: http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html\n\nA: I am using a static build of a recent ffmpeg, but it should not matter. \nWhat I use is \nffmpeg -i videoin.avi -ss 30 -r 1 -t 1 myimage.png\n\nthat skips the first 30 seconds, then use a framerate of 1 frame/sec and creates images for 1 second. \nGoogling around I found this: http://linuxers.org/tutorial/how-extract-images-video-using-ffmpeg with a bit more options. \n", "Q: Wrong resolution after login with Xubuntu 13.10 after updating to Xubuntu 13.10, I cannot log in with my normal user anymore.

No resolution problems. It's like a wrong resolution is stored by the old user, but I cannot figure out in which files this resolution is stored, and - obviously - I can't check in the settings manager either, as I can't get to it.\nAny ideas?

When I try to boot the usb flash drive the text that appears is garbled.It works in legacy mode but not in UEFI. \nHow could I install Ubuntu in UEFI mode ? \nThis is how the bootscreen looks. \n\n\nA: First, are you saying that this is what happens after you select the boot option in GRUB, or that GRUB itself looks this way?\nThat looks like a video firmware or driver bug to me. I have several suggestions, but none is a sure-fire solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Post more details about your computer's video hardware. Post the computer's make and model, its video chipset(s), and any other relevant details (such as how it's connected to an external monitor, if it's a desktop). This may enable somebody with relevant knowledge to give you more specific advice.\n\n*Try issuing video-related kernel options in GRUB (or whatever boot manager/boot loader you're using). The \"nomodeset\" option is often recommended, but others that are more specific to your video card may be more appropriate. (Obviously this is possible only if the video problem appears after you select the boot option in GRUB.)\n\n*Try installing in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and then switch the boot mode to EFI by installing an EFI boot loader. (See here for information on several and generic installation instructions.) Both types of boot loader can coexist on one system, so it's possible to hobble along for a while with a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation while you test your EFI boot loaders and related options.\n\n*Adjust your boot loader's EFI video mode. There are GRUB commands for doing this, but I don't recall what they are offhand. (You'd need to adjust grub.cfg on your installation medium to change the boot mode.) In rEFInd, you'd use the resolution option in refind.conf -- but of course you'll only be able to do this if you switch to rEFInd. Using rEFInd is relatively easy to do once Linux is installed, but getting rEFInd to boot the Ubuntu installer is much trickier.\n\n*Try using another monitor, at least for installation. If your computer is a laptop, many of them do support external monitors, so you could try plugging one in temporarily.\n\n", "Q: Grub menu still shows after Ubuntu uninstallation I'm not sure this is technically the grub menu as I don't really have much knowledge with Ubuntu. \nBut, when I boot my computer I'm given the option to boot into Windows 8.1 or Ubuntu.

I also went to msconfig to delete Ubuntu from the boot tab but it wasn't there so I don't really know how to proceed. Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: You can remove GRUB on make default bootloader as window using Easy BCD on Windows. You can customize all bootloaders with Easy BCD\n\nA: here is a good article (german) about it: →.\nSummarizing it in English:\nUse our installation CD of Windows Vista/7/8 to delete GRUB.

I hope that's what you're looking for.\nEDIT: Added the quotes around $i.\n\nA: You can use mmv:\nmmv -v \"*\" \".#1\"\n\nSimple and to the point!\nTo un-hide them back:\nmmv -v \".*\" \"#1\"\n\n\nA: rename 's/^/./' file1.txt 'file with spaces' 'third file.mkd'\n\nYou can of course use globs. The following will add a dot to the beginning of every file that ends with .txt:\nrename 's/^/./' *.txt\n\nOr you could hide every file beginning with foo and ending with .mkd:\nrename 's/^/./' foo*.mkd\n\nrename is using a substitute command: s/foo/bar/ replaces the first foo with bar. Instead of foo, you can also use a regular expression, and in regexes ^ means 'the beginning of the line'. So s/^/./ tells rename to 'replace the beginning of the line with a .'. That is: it places the dot before the first character.\nYou can also use the -n option to do a 'test run' -- with that, rename will not actually rename the files, but will list all the files that it would have changed, were you not using the -n flag.\nrename -n 's/^/./' *.txt\n\n\nA: To quickly hide all files of the current directory from display in Nautilus:\nls * > .hidden\n\nThis will create a list of hidden files in the file .hidden within the current directory. It will of course not hide these files on the command line, and if we chose to display hidden files from Nautilus they will show up again (as will . files).\nTo only hide a subset of files use appropriate wildcards, or edit the .hidden file with an editor.\nTo show all files again, just remove the .hidden file.\n\nA: My prefered method is using \"nautilus-hide\" in \"Nautilus-Actions-Extra\" package:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nae-team/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions-extra nautilus-hide\nnautilus -q\n\nAfter selecting files/folders in Nautilus, choose (Un)Hide > Hide from the context menu.\nThis creates a file named \".hidden\" containing a list of files/folders to be hidden.\n", "Q: How do I install open office on a linux eeePC?

By default, Juju on LXC uses the LXC bridge (lxcbr0), but we have the option of configuring LXC to use a bridge that also has eth0 interface on it.\nI assume that your LAN exists within the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, and your eth0 interface has IP address of 192.168.1.2.\nYou will need to set up bridging:\n1) Edit /etc/network/interfaces\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\nbridge_ports eth0\naddress 192.168.1.2\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nbridge_stp off\nbridge_fd 0\nbridge_maxwait 0\n\n2) Configure LXC to use your newly created bridge interface.

Sometimes I share my Internet connection with my neighbours via the Network Manager GUI (Ubuntu 12.04) but there is something I am worried about...\nIs it sharing just the Internet connection or is my home local network (with all my PCs, shared folders, smartphones, network printers and other devices) somehow exposed too?\nMy local network has a 192.168.1.x range while the shared connection is in the range 10.x.x.x but, what happens if my neighbour changes his ip to one in my range?

There were (are?) issues with very large / (root) partitions. So my suggestion is to keep Ubuntu / to 25GB and then have separate /home and your NTFS shared data partition. Also better to have / near the beginning of drive, some BIOS have issues with / beyond 100GB on drive, but seems to be more an issue with external USB hard drives, BIOS and grub (not sure which).\nI would probably keep the Windows boot loader on the Windows drive and grub2 on the Ubuntu drive. But you also could install grub to both.\nYou do have to use Something Else or manual install to get the option on where to install the grub2 boot loader. All default installs just install to sda (assumes BIOS set to boot sda). Then change BIOS to boot from drive you installed grub into.\nIf drive may ever be used with a UEFI system in near future I might reserve 300MB space at beginning of drive for an efi partition. Per UEFI spec it is supposed to be first, but Windows often makes it second or third but still near beginning of drive. Adding that when drive is full might be an issue.\nFor grub to install correctly to gpt drive booting in BIOS mode, you will have to have a tiny 1 or 2 MB unformatted partition with the bios_grub boot flag. That can be anywhere on the drive.\n", "Q: Error occured when \"sudo apt-get update\" MessageBox said that\n\nUnable to initialize package information.\nIn the process of initializing the package information, Unable to solve problem has occured.\nIncluding the following error message: 'update-manager' package, please report a bug:\n'E: source list / etc / apt / sources.list the line 6 is incorrect (dist parse)'\n\nIt seem to be a some touble.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Open the file and search for the line with the problem with:\ngksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIn my case, the file contains this in the first seven lines (compare it):\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 13.04 _Raring Ringtail_ - Release amd64 (20130424)]/ raring main restricted\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring main restricted #Added by software-properties\n\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\ndeb http://ubuntu.grn.cat/ubuntu/ raring main restricted\ndeb-src http://ubuntu.grn.cat/ubuntu/ raring universe main restricted multiverse #Added by software-properties\n\nCheck if there's a difference.

When I'm doing something that requires root be typed in dozens of times in a row, I prefer to switch my session to a root session. In the various tutorials and instructions I have used on the Internet, I see sudo su, sudo su -, sudo -i and sudo /bin/bash being used to open a root session, but I'm not clear on the difference between these and when or if that difference matters.\nCan someone clear this up for me?\n\nA: To look for differences you may chack the resulting environment among different invocations.\nYou could find some \"small\" differences in some critical variables:\n\n\n*\n\n*PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD\nor some difference in ~/. dotfiles handling (~/.config).\nConsider also the ownership of $HOME based logfiles (~/.xsession.errors, etc ...) or xauth cookies (~/.Xauthority) that commands generate.\nTry these commands:\n\n# 'su -' vs 'su'\n\ndiff <(sudo su - -c env | sort) <(sudo su -c env | sort)\n\n\n# 'su -' vs 'sudo -i'\n\ndiff <(sudo su - -c env | sort) <(sudo -i env | sort)\n\n\n\n\nA: To explain this you need to know what the programs do:\n\n\n*\n\n*su - The command su is used to switch to another user (s witch u ser), but you can also switch to the root user by invoking the command with no parameter. su asks you for the password of the user to switch, after typing the password you switched to the user's environment.     \n\n*sudo - sudo is meant to run a single command with root privileges. But unlike su it prompts you for the password of the current user. This user must be in the sudoers file (or a group that is in the sudoers file). By default, Ubuntu \"remembers\" your password for 15 minutes, so that you don't have to type your password every time.\n\n*bash - A text-interface to interact with the computer. It's important to understand the difference between login, non-login, interactive and non-interactive shells:\n\n\nTypes of shells:\n\n\n*\n\n*login shell: A login shell logs you into the system as a specified user, necessary for this is a username and password. When you hit ctrl+alt+F1 to login into a virtual terminal you get after successful login a login shell.\n\n*non-login shell: A shell that is executed without logging in, necessary for this is a currently logged-in user. When you open a graphic terminal in gnome it is a non-login shell.\n\n*interactive shell: A shell (login or non-login) where you can interactively type or interrupt commands. For example a gnome terminal.\n\n*non-interactive shell: A (sub)shell that is probably run from an automated process. You will see neither input nor output.\n\n\nSo the cases are:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo su Calls sudo with the command su. Bash is called as interactive non-login shell. So bash only executes .bashrc. You can see that after switching to root you are still in the same directory:\nuser@host:~$ sudo su\nroot@host:/home/user#\n\n\n*sudo su - This time it is a login shell, so /etc/profile, .profile and .bashrc are executed and you will find yourself in root's home directory with root's environment.\n\n*sudo -i It is nearly the same as sudo su - The -i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell specified by the password database entry of the target user as a login shell.  This means that login-specific resource files such as .profile, .bashrc or .login will be read and executed by the shell.\n\n*sudo /bin/bash This means that you call sudo with the command /bin/bash. /bin/bash is started as non-login shell so all the dot-files are not executed, but bash itself reads .bashrc of the calling user. Your environment stays the same. Your home will not be root's home. So you are root, but in the environment of the calling user.\n\n*sudo -s reads the $SHELL variable and executes the content. If $SHELL contains /bin/bash it invokes sudo /bin/bash (see above).\nCheck:\nTo check if you are in a login shell or not (works only in bash because shopt is a builtin command):\nshopt -q login_shell && echo 'Login shell' || echo 'No login shell'\n\n", "Q: Recover LVM without boot HDD I have scoured the 'net for an answer and am here as a last resort;\nI have a \"NAS\" running Ubuntu Server.

The easier method to know that is through the lvm backup files you have. It doesn't really matter that they're a few days old, as long as the lvm-partitioning didn't change since then.

I wonder what is normal Bit Depth for Audacious Player there are 16/24/32 bits available I tried them all seems fine.\nI use stereo output for my speakers and I wonder what bit depth be the best for stereo output so not to overload the hardware or some, right now I set it to 24 bits.\n\nA: You won't hear any difference when your music is still mastered with CD quality (PCM with 44,1 kHz samplerate and 16 bit audio bit depth) for mainstream consumption (loudness war).\nChanging the PulseAudio defaults - which are set to CD quality - and setting higher values while still playing the same material from mainstream equipment will only result in computational overhead.\nQuestions on audio quality are often confused with questions on music taste or general preference.\n\nGoing beyond mainstream audio equipment and music formats (lossless CD rips are still mainstream) is rather off-topic for this site, but Monty Montgomery's lengthy article on Why 24-bit/192kHz music downloads make no sense is worth a read.\n\nA: Pulseaudio: \n/etc/pulse/client.conf:\n; default-sample-format = s16le   # = PCM 16 bits\n; default-sample-rate = 44100\n; default-sample-channels = 2\n; default-channel-map = front-left,front-right\n\nThese are the default values that pulseaudio uses for the downmix. If you play other bitrates, they will be converted to 44.1 kHz and sampleformat will always be truncated to 16 bits.\nSo it is a bit useless to go for 24-bit unless you uncomment and change these values but you will absolutely need Hi-end studio gear to notice some differences though. (and only if, of course, your source material is 24 bit too)\nIf your audiocard can only do 48 kHz you best change the downmixrate to 48 kHz because the samplerateconverter in pulseaudio is quite a bit better that the samplerateconverter in ALSA(=the driver for your audiocard). You can even change the conversion algorythm. See http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man5/pulse-daemon.conf.5.html\n\nA: The more refined speaker systems make use of the higher sample rates and can discern greater bitrates.  For a laptop there isn't that much worry with default speakers, but plug it in to a set of harman kardon speakers and you would hear the difference.  This comes from setting up systems that can be heard at a concert as clearly sitting in the loges as standing in front of the stage, speaker matching, balancing volume and tone.\nSorry I digressed: Default seems to be 44100, 16 bit; I set it to 44100 32 bit. I get nothing from PCM,it's just dead space. Same in Ubuntu as for Windows on my laptop. Was set at that rate in the beginning. \n", "Q: Can't access Windos 7 OS in Ubuntu When I try and Access my Windows 7 OS I get the following memo and I have no idea what to make of the code.\nError mounting /dev/sda2 at /media/name/Windows7_OS: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda2\" \"/media/name/Windows7_OS\"' exited with non-zero exit status 13: ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: Input/output error\nFailed to read NTFS $Bitmap: Input/output error\nNTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a\nSoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware.

You cannot load music on your iPod with 13.10. I have tried every program I could find, and none of them seem to work. gtkpod crashes so often it is unusable. It is not clear to me that it does anything. Rhythmbox crashes frequently also. With Rhythmbox you cannot create new playlists on the device. They have removed every facility you used to use to do this. I cannot find a way to do it. Banshee deleted all of my playlists and also crashes a lot. Something is very wrong with this release. (This subject has not been good since about 10.04.) Best bet: go buy a Mac! I can't get Ubuntu to work with an iPod.\n\nA: The answer for me was to install Banshee Media Player. I formatted the ipod for windows first using virtualbox and Windows 7 with the apple software- If this is a fresh out of the box ipod you will need to do this and remember to enable USB2 devices on your virtual machine. After that you should be able to drag things your Banshee library onto your ipod - ensure you have enabled the ipod support plugin in Banshee.

I found that you can have no more than 4 primary partitions on any given drive. If your drive has 4 partitions already, make sure that when you attempt to partition the drive as shown above that you select logical for each one, or if you can make one primary, try to make a single EXT4 /boot primary partition that has just 500MB of space (1/2GB). Make sure the /home partition is th largest as it will hold all your files and data. the / partition, or 'root' partition, need not be larger than 6000MB (6GB) as the root is designed to fit on a 5.7GB DVD. Again, assure that all but the /boot partition are set as logical instead of primary.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One on Android doesn't sync files I've installed and set up Ubuntu One on 2 Ubuntu machines and one Android.

To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal using Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Type gksudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf (or sudo -H gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf) and type your password when it prompts you.\n\n*In the window that opens up, type the following, replacing username by your username, password by your password, host by your proxy host, port_no by your proxy's port number:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://username:password@host:port_no\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://username:password@host:port_no\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://username:password@host:port_no\";\nAcquire::socks::proxy \"socks://username:password@host:port_no\";\n\nPress Ctrl+S to save and exit.\n\nA: Check the file sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.\nAfter applying the proxy \"system wide\", the contents of /etc/apt/apt.conf are like:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://172.16.0.2:8080/\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://172.16.0.2:8080/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://172.16.0.2:8080/\";\n\nHere ipadress-of-proxy-server:port I am using 172.16.0.2:8080 as sample. Use your proxy server address and port whatever you have. But, in order to make this work, you must add your username and password into it (unless you use an unnamed proxy) as follows:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://<username>:<password>@172.16.0.2:8080\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://<username>:<password>@172.16.0.2:8080/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://<username>:<password>@172.16.0.2:8080/\";\n\nTo edit the file run in the following command in terminal (instead of gedit you can use your any text-editor if you wish):\nsudo -H gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nNext save the file and run the following command in terminal to make system understand the changes in APT's settings:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nHere you are good to go to install things from both a terminal and the Software Center.\n(Note that by the apt.conf settings the proxy will only work on software-center/terminal with apt-get.)\nThere is more information here at AptGet/Howto in the Ubuntu official documentation.\n", "Q: How to make text file created in Ubuntu compatible with Windows Notepad? Sometime I have to use the text files created in Ubuntu, using editors, in Windows editors. So basically when ever I create a text file in Ubuntu I append the extension .txt, and it does make the file open in Windows very easily.\nBut the actual problem is the text files created in Ubuntu are so difficult to understand (read) when opened in Windows' Notepad. No matter how many lines have been used, all the lines appear in the same one line.\nIs there a easy way to save the text files in Ubuntu's basic editors so that it can be seen exactly the same in Windows' notepad?\n\nA: Converting Unix-style line termination to Windows-style and back\nI'm not sure if it's installed by default. Try this to be sure\nsudo apt-get install dos2unix\n\nYou can convert the files with this to Windows-style\nunix2dos myFileFromUbuntu.txt\n\nAnd with this back to Unix-style\ndos2unix myFileFromWindows.txt\n\nChanging them back is often unnecessary. You will find, that the standard text editors handle Windows-style line termination just fine. \n\nA: Unlike Unix where a new line is represented by a LF character we need a combination CR/LF for files in DOS/Windows:\nGedit\nWe can let Gedit save text documents with Windows-style line endings in the File -> Save as dialog.\n\n\n*\n\n*Adjust the settings for Line Endings in the drop down menu to Windows.\n\nNano\nTo make nano write text files in DOS format we have to run it with the following command line option 1:\nnano --dos <filename>\n\nVim\nVim can convert files from Unix to DOS format with the following control sequences  2 :\n:update\n:e ++ff=dos\n:w\n\nEmacs\nTo set the buffer coding to DOS style issue Meta +  x :\nset-buffer-file-coding-system utf-8-dos\n\n", "Q: History command showing the directory and the date Is there a way to have in the .bash_history file, listed: the directory where the command has been typed, the date, and the command ? \n\nA: You CAN write the current working directory in a history file as well, but you have to make an own history file:\nWrite your .bashrc as follows:\nexport CUSTOM_HISTFILE=\"/tmp/bash_history\" #path of the new history file\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a; history -c; history -r; date | xargs echo -n >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; echo -n ' - ' >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; pwd | xargs echo -n >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; echo -n ' - ' >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; tail -n 1 $HISTFILE >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; $PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\nIt's a bit circumstantial, but it works. An entry could look like this:\nMit Nov 13 13:44:39 CET 2013 - /home/test - ls -la\n\n\nA: History command showing the directory: NO! :(\nHistory command showing the date: YES! :)\nThat's because (from man history):\n\nThe history list is an array of history entries.  A  history  entry is\ndeclared as follows:\n\n   typedef void * histdata_t;\n\n   typedef struct _hist_entry {\n     char *line;\n     char *timestamp;\n     histdata_t data;\n   } HIST_ENTRY;\n\n\nSo, nothing about the directory where the command has been typed.\nTo know the exact time certain command was executed, see help history:\n\nIf the $HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set and not null, its value is used\nas a format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated\nwith each displayed history entry.  No time stamps are printed\notherwise.\n\n\nSo all you have to do is to set $HISTTIMEFORMAT something like this in the current shell:\nexport HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T \"\n\nTo have it permanently set, run the following command:\necho 'export HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T \"' >> ~/.bashrc\n\nThe above command will add a new line (export HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T \") at the end of your ~/.bashrc file.\nNow, the output of history will look something like this:\n ...\n 1613  2013-11-13 13:00:15 cat .bash_history\n 1614  2013-11-13 13:01:04 man history\n 1615  2013-11-13 13:11:58 help history\n 1616  2013-11-13 13:19:07 ls\n 1617  2013-11-13 13:19:09 cd\n 1618  2013-11-13 13:19:15 history\n\n\nA: Can you please clear your question a bit. There is a command called fc(fixed command) in ubuntu which enables you to display the history file, edit and re-execute previous command. Basically it is the alias set up for history command.\nBy default,\nfc  -l lists the 16 most recent commands.\n\nYou can also use\nhistory command itself to see the command history.\n\n", "Q: Failed to execute child process?

I am using Backtrack 5 r3 with Gnome, which is based off of ubuntu 10.04.\n\nA: You have lost the binary file of Mozilla firefox. By lost, I mean it has either been renamed/replaced/moved/deleted; any of these. If you do not know what has actually happened and can afford to lose your firefox data(browsing history, saved passwords, etc.) then the easiest way to procure the binary is to re-install the complete package.\nTo re-install, open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get purge firefox\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\n\nA: This can be solved by not running the application as a root user, therefore create another user and launch the application from there it works fine.\n\nA: FWIW.

So, you copy this binary file to /usr/bin and you are done.\nBe careful NOT to download later versions of the package than the one that you had installed in your system in order to avoid incompatibility problems!\nEDIT: After a constructive comment by chaos please note that if you have already installed the package in your system then you can find it in /var/cache/apt/archives/.

I'm new to Ubuntu and trying to figure out if it's possible to have a remote access using ssh keys on a 3g dongle?\nIs there any possible way?\nMaybe using a 3g wireless router?\nHow to set-up?\nCan I access Dynamic IP address?\nSorry got a lot of questions this is for my project.\nI hope you guys can help or sort it out. :)\n\nA: Yeah it's possible to have remote access using a 3g dongle. To get started, open up the terminal on the machine you want to remotely access and type ifconfig and note the ip address under the pppoe section. This will be the ip address of your machine on the internet. Then you can just ssh user@ip_address from your other machine and you're good to go. \nHowever there are some problems with this method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your ip address might change every time you reconnect the dongle since it uses dhcp to get its ip address from its server. So you might have to perform ifconfig every time which defeats the entire point of remote access.\n\n*Since your dongle probably doesn't use NAT, all your open ports are exposed to the internet which could be potentially dangerous. I'd suggest you use iptables or some other firewall to close up the ports which are not required.\n\n", "Q: Linker error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgcc_s I am trying to compile symlinks (tar.gz-file), which is a very small tool with one line for compilation: \ngcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes  -O2 -N -s -o symlinks symlinks.c\n\nwhich gives the error \n....    \n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgcc_s\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgcc_s\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nThe output of \n/sbin/ldconfig -p | grep libgcc\n\nis \nlibgcc_s.so.1 (libc6) => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1\n\nand trying to include the mentioned directory directly\ngcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -L /lib/i386-linux-gnu/  -O2 -N -s -o symlinks symlinks.c\n\nproduces the same error. \nThree questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Why does it not work with the first command, as the lib seems to be in the search path\n\n*Why does including the path itself does not help\n\n*How to fix this?\n\n\nA: Solution: Omitting the option -N.\n", "Q: Ecryptfs: lost passphrase When I mounted some dir by \nmount -t ecryptfs private data\n\nI entered wrong password.

I mean, there are lots of fanmade operating systems, but it's heavy and hard work!\nTo begin with, an operating system shall have, at least:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Bootloader: To push the kernel into the RAM, prepare the TLBs and make some housekeeping\n\n*A Kernel: the kernel is the most essential part of an operating system, and it manages crucial aspects such as the physical/virtual memory mappings between programs, multitasking, I/O scheduling, IPC, mutexes and so on. Depending on the OS, there are several philosofies (monolithic, like the Linux architecture; hybrid, like the OS X architecture; or microkernel, like the unfinished Hurd).

Is your Windows installed in legacy BIOS mode? \nTo confirm this, from the Ubuntu Live Desktop environment, open a Terminal and install gdisk (ensure you have network connectivity):\nsudo apt-get install gdisk\n\nThen list partitions that are on the GUID partition table:\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nChances are, it might have come up empty. In that case, you will need to preserve the MBR and drop the stray GUID partition table identifier entirely:\nsudo fixparts /dev/sda\nw\n\nMore information here: http://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/\n", "Q: how to run more then one process through terminal I am having some trouble in starting more then one process in a single terminal window..\nlike as i have started wvdial by \nsudo wvdial\n\nit shows all initiating process details but wont give back\npankaj@N5010:~$ \n\nuntil i press ctrl+c to terminate which causes terminate wvdial.. \nwhat i want is to start both wvdial and nautilus in same terminal window.Is it possible??\n\nA: Yes you can. Just append the ampersand character (&) at the end of the command. This will allow the program to run as a background job in the shell. Like this:\nsudo wvdial &\nnautilus\n\nIt's worth nothing that you will still see terminal output from the task while it's running in the background. \n\nA: Append the first command with an ampersand & which makes the command run in the background. man bash says:\nIf a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.\n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu on Toshiba M50D-A-103, AMD A6-5200 I am trying to install Ubuntu on my new Toshiba notebook but cannot get past the first steps of booting. I try to install 13.10 (64-bit) from USB, the result is always the same: I get to the black screen letting me choose to try or install ubuntu (which, as I read, tells me I am in UEFI mode, which I should be, since there is already Windows 8 installed). However, booting always stops after a few lines and I get a black screen with nothing happening anymore. Everything happens very fast and I can't even read the last lines before the screen goes black.\nI have tried to change the boot options, removing quiet splash and adding nomodeset acpi=off nolapic no splash (according to some suggestions I found googling).

But give the CD a try.\nkind regards \n\nA: I tried to install Ubuntu on a Toshiba laptop, first as the sole OS, erasing Windows, and then reinstalling Windows with Ubuntu as a dual boot. Everything gave me the same black screen with the Toshiba logo. Finally, I went into the BIOS and disabled the Secure Boot, which turns out to block everything that is not Toshiba manufactured. After that, I installed Windows and Ubuntu side by side, and everything worked perfectly.\n", "Q: Has the support for the Python language been removed from the SDK? Has the support for the Python language been removed from the SDK in Ubuntu 13.10? I can't find any tutorial for the Unity scope and for Python.\n\nA: Scopes are transitioning to C++\nThe reason you might find it hard to find official tutorials for python is because Canonical is transitioning scopes to C++ (this is linked from the official Cookbook page).\nYou can still use python to write scopes, but it's not the primary target of Canonical... which is sad, I personally love python.\n", "Q: USB Soundcard resets when no sound is played my USB sound interface (M-Audio Fast Track Ultra 8R) works fine but when I stop playing sound it seems to \"shut down\" after about 5 seconds (green lights pop up which happens on windows only if you start the device - and I get a huge sound pop which is quite annoying).

I wanted to report the problem but they asked me for a Password and I did not know the Password. So I carried on and it worked okay for me.

Can someone hack Ubuntu if it is not properly installed?\n\nA: \"Hacked\" is a very general term. Know that any system can be hacked. Linux software happens to have features that make it nearly impossible to hack in the same way you would a Windows system. Besides, since the majority of PC users use Windows, most viruses are made for Windows. However, viruses for Linux have been created - not successfully, and mostly for \"experimentation\" purposes, but it has been done.\nI would very strongly recommend that you ask the people who installed Ubuntu on your computer for your password and change it as soon as possible. Usually, when installing new systems, it is common to have the password be the same as the username, so try that.\nSee this question about the errors: Getting \"System program problem detected\" pops up regularly after upgrade\nAbout the text size: it might be a good thing.

It involves two things: network connectivity and key features such as restart and shutdown not working.\n\n\n*\n\n*The network won't re-enable after suspend. This is really annoying. I use features such as apache to serve locally. When network connectivity gets lost after wake, people get angry. \n\n*I have two screens, and ever since I attached the second one, features, more specifically the bottom three options in the settings menu (top right), aren't working. However, the terminal does work. \nI need someone to help me, or I'm going to have to go back to, most likely, 12.04.

Some hardware can disable or disconnect after shutting down for a while, bugs like this are usually fixed eventually...\nAs for problem #2, pop into Terminal and see if the command 'sudo shutdown -h now' actually shuts down the computer and 'sudo reboot' restarts it ok.\n", "Q: gksudo nautilus - incorrect password I have Ubuntu 12.04 running on my office PC.

What is the solution to this?\nThanks!\n\nA: I believe you are trying to access the AdminUser account in a wrong way, or perhaps entering the wrong password. From a session with the HatcheryUser try to launch a new session with AdminUser: \nsudo su AdminUser\n\nThis will prompt you for a password, the one from HatcheryUser. If the latter is in the sudoers list you will then enter an admin session from where you'll be able to run all the dangerous stuff.\n", "Q: Netflix won't open on clean install of 13.10 I just installed a clean version of 13.10 (Saucy) and tried to install Netflix using these instructions.  The installation seemed to go fine, I opened Netflix after and it asked me to install a bunch of extra things through Wine, so I did.  But after that, clicking on the Netflix launcher icon did nothing.  No windows open, no error message...nothing.  Then I tried running netflix-desktop from the terminal.  It pauses for maybe ten seconds, then takes me back to the command prompt.  No error messages or anything else is printed at the terminal.  I tried running wine-browser too at the terminal and the same thing.  However, if I run either of the aforementioned commands with sudo, it prints\nwine: /home/jacob/.wine-browser is not owned by you\nwine: /home/jacob/.wine-browser is not owned by you\nwine: /home/jacob/.wine-browser is not owned by you\n\nbut otherwise the same behavior.  Any idea what's going on?  The only thought I have is that I installed an Nvidia close-source driver (version 319) and maybe that's doing something, but I have no idea.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Ok, so turns out that Pipelight is the best solution.  I went ahead and followed their instructions for installing Wine, and it worked like a charm.  It's great because I can run it in my browser of choice, unlike the original method of running netflix, which makes you use Firefox.  If you're having the same problem, try this.  http://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/pipelight-use-silverlight-in-your-linux.html\n\nA: Simply run\nsudo rm -Rf ~/.wine-browser  \n\nNOTE that there is NO SPACE between ~/ and .wine-browser.\nThis will solve the problem and let you watch Netflix on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Looking the modifications to disable capture for alsa driver I wrote alsa drivers for mycard by referring dummy.c sound drivers. My card doesnt support capture functionality. I defined playback operations but not capture operations to avoid capture support. My card driver resides along with other additional usb audio devices. \nI have a issue with Master Volume control. When I use amixer to control the master volume, it applies for both palyback and capture streams. For capture amixer function snd_mixer_selem_has_capture_channel(elem, chn) returns true for both left and right channels. Because of this playback volume put operations is called for capture also. Since the same volume control operation is called for both playback and capture it makes volume controls applies twice (increments / decrements).\nI modified snddevice script not to create capture devices and ensure the same @/dev/snd. \nI need help to avoid / disable this capture support, so that snd_mixer_selem_has_capture_channel(elem, chn) return false for card playback channels.\n\nA: If the implementation of your capture mixer control does the wrong thing, and if you don't even do capturing, then you should not have capture mixer controls in the first place.\n", "Q: 403 forbidden error for all local projects after updating php and apache I have 5 web app projects in my local machine with Ubuntu 12.04 installed on it.

My purpose is to have an OS like unmanage vps/server for web hosting out there. For Learning in my own space before jumping to online!\nI have a notebook Dell Vostro 3460 with i5 3230M. I have Window 7 Ultimate 32bit currently running. I want to know: What Ubuntu should I install for my purpose (Desktop or Server)? Should I use 32bit or 64bit? Which version is suitable for newbie start learning like me (12.04.3 LTS or 13.10)?\nThanks in advanced! Please, easy on me as I'm just starting out!\n\nA: With a machine that new, a 64 bit OS is the right choice for almost all users.\nSince you are planning on installing Ubuntu on your laptop, the desktop version is the way to go. That will give you a desktop environment to get started with. While most servers don't use graphical programs, for someone new to Linux an OS with only a command line can be very intimidating.\nI'd recommend Ubuntu 12.04 for your laptop, since that version is known to work with very little problems. Also, if you should later decide to try the latest version, it's only an upgrade away, no need to reinstall Ubuntu.\n\nA: Dell Vostro 3460, by standard, uses Windows 7 64-bit edition. So I recommend you download a 64-bit flavour of Ubuntu.\nIf you want to run Ubuntu on you PC for a long time, use 12.04 LTS which is the most stable version yet. But unless you want a constant refresh, get yourself 13.10, which has 6-month support (nothing to do with license).\n", "Q: Difference between make-kpkg and make deb-pkg I have build the kernel image by make-kpkg and  make deb-pkg in 13.04 ubuntu and noticed that image size is very big in case of deb-pkg build. \ndeb-pkg build size is 13 times bigger than make-kpkg .\nCan anyone please share why the difference is there ?\nRegards\nTitu\n\nA: I came across this issue as well.

This will even be to an extent where you experience a loss in details (lossy compression).\nFurther compression could only be achieved by resampling all videos with another video codec (or codec setting) which will lead to further compression artifacts. You probably do not want this.\nAny lossless compression tool will not lead to a significant further decrease in video file size, or in the worst case may even increase it.\n", "Q: Having problem with alias?

Although you can create your own smart playlists, all criteria only match directly to a song from your database. Any comparison between found songs or grouping of matching songs is not possible. At most you can edit the smart playlist for \"never played\" to order songs by album (of course only the not yet played ones)\nLooking at clementine's database at ~/.config/Clementine/clementine.db it seems, that clementine essentially manages all songs in an single table named 'songs' (so no extra tables for artist or album). But as it is a sqlite database it should be possible to write a little program that does the appropriate queries to find albums where no song has ever been played. Something like this:\nselect album, track, title, playcount, filename from songs \n  where album in (select distinct album from songs where playcount = 0) \n  and album not in (select distinct album from songs where playcount != 0) \n  order by album, track;\n\nFrom this list a playlist could be generated. I'm not sure about directly inserting it back into the database, but exporting a .m3u or .pls should be possible. \nA possible problem could be that several artists could have albums of the same same as well as there could be albums with several artists on them. So separating albums could be an issue.\n\nA: Adaephon answers correctly that this is not properly possible in clementine at the moment, but there is a crude way around it if your music library is ordered something like Artist/Album/tracknr-title.mp3 on disk.\nIn this case you can create a smart playlist that has Play count equals 0 in the search terms, and then on the next page Sort songs by File name A-Z (this includes path) and Limits to Show all the songs. Save the playlist, without dynamic mode, start it, and put your shuffle mode on Shuffle albums\nDownside of this method: The matching is done on song level, which means that if you played a couple of songs on an album but not the full album, it will still show up in the list, but without the songs you already played.\n", "Q: How do I get a log or an error output from any application run from the terminal? I want to know how to get a log file of a program. This is useful to find the faults in an application when it crashes. \nI mean opening the application through the terminal and at the same time writing a log file.\nAre there special commands to do this, or is it automatically done whenever an application is run? If so, where is that log file stored?\n\nA: Not all applications will leave a log behind, it depends on the coding behind them, even complex ones might not have logging capabilities.\nIf an application has a debug, verbose or log capabilities that option will be declared in the man page of that application, ie: man ssh will show you that if you use ssh -v you will get a verbose output of what the command is doing on the background when opening a tunnel to a host, ssh -y will output to syslog instead of stderr.\nBut some applications are just not programmed with that capability. For those strace can be used as a debugging utility for any application though, it logs all system calls and signals, I find it useful when I have any crashes or unexpected faults while running an application, and most of the times it helps me sort issues with applications that do not have a debug or a log option built in to their code, ie strace ls outputs:\nexecve(\"/usr/bin/ls\", [\"ls\"], [/* 95 vars */]) = 0\nbrk(0)                                  = 0x20b6000\nmmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7fd7e5ca3000\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.preload\", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopen(\"/etc/ld.so.cache\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nfstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=118369, ...}) = 0\nmmap(NULL, 118369, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x7fd7e5c86000\nclose(3)                                = 0\nopen(\"/lib64/libselinux.so.1\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nread(3, \"\\177ELF\\2\\1\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\3\\0>\\0\\1\\0\\0\\0\\20l\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\"..., 832) = 832\n...\n...\n...\n\nThis allows you to have an idea of what is happening and why is an application failing to halting in its code.\n\nA: I think all you want is to see the text in the terminal and at the same time write it to a file:\nls -l | tee -a ls.log\n\nThis lists your files to the terminal and to ls.log. The -a is for appending instead of overwriting in case ls.log exists.\nNote that this does not work for terminal applications, like less or top or anything that has menus and scrolls.\nIf some text is missing in the \"log\" you have to redirect the error messages to the standard output:\nls filedoesnotexist_or_whatever_leads_to_an_error 2>&1 | tee -a ls.log\n\n", "Q: Confused with the alias solution? I am trying to define alias for a group of commands counting recursively and displaying the number of all sub-directories encountered for any working directory (including ones with invisible file names). So far what I have done is:\nls -R | wc -l\n\nBut it does not display the hidden files number. So I tried this command:\nls -l | grep ^d | wc -l\n\nBut I am not sure whether it is the right command or not?\n\nA: You should never parse the output of ls. See some explanations here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why you shouldn't parse the output of ls(1)\nAs others recommended, use find instead. And the best way (even when you have directory names  that contain  newlines  or other  types of white space) would be:\nalias countdir='find . -type d -print0 | tr -dc \"\\\\0\" | wc -c'\n\nSee man find, man tr, man wc for more info.\n\nA: Is find . -type d|wc -l a solution?\n\nA: I'd recommend using find (man page) to do the searching. As an example,\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type d | wc -l\nwill print the number of all directories in the current working directory. \nThe -maxdepth option controls how far find will descend into the directories. With a value of 1, it will just use the current directory and list its subdirectories. With 2, it will list the subdirectories' subdirectories, too, and so on.\nThis has just a single, small drawback: find includes . (the current working directory) in its listing, thus the number returned by wc -l will be off by one.\n", "Q: Cant Resume Torrent Downloads After Restarting the PC I was trying to download big files from torrent \nIn my place the electricity is gone off for 2- 3 hours every 24 hour , which will interrupt my torrent download . \nOn windows torrent when I turn on my PC when  the electricity comes and it complete the download , On Ubuntu it just give and error and restart the download from the beginning.  \nI tried more than file all the same .

The current source code doesn't compile on all version of Ubuntu - especially since usb_modeswitch moved to using libusb1.\nTry grabbing the copy I have @ http://trixarian.net/sakis3g.gz\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS - second display not always recognized I use 12.04.3 (64 bit) on an Asus Zenbook Prime (-> info) with an Intel hd 3000 video card:\nuname -a\nLinux maroubra 3.8.0-33-generic #48~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 24 16:28:06 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nlspci -v\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc.

This not only is very annoying but also starts to wear out the (mini-) HDMI connection on my laptop (I must have done this about a million times in the last year).\nI should add that I'm observing this behavior over a year on quite a few distros (Linux Mint, Ubuntu 12.04 / 12.10 / 13.10) and kernels. I've never paid much attention to setting up dual displays so far - which makes it pretty vanilla in this regards. \nIntel provides Linux drivers for hd 3000, but they don't support 12.04 any more, and most information I find seems to indicate that special drivers shouldn't be required.\n\nA: It's not an elegant solution, but one suggestion is to force xrandr to always output video via HDMI. Taken from the answer to Can I force VGA signal output even when xrandr shows 'disconnected'?\nTo force output to HDMI at 1024x768 run these commands in the terminal\nxrandr --addmode HDMI1 1024x768\nand then\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --mode 1024x768 --right-of eDP1\nThis will add a second display even if there's no cable actually connected. Now, when you plug in the HDMI cable the output should be displayed.\n", "Q: Kubuntu Fails To Mount NTFS on startup, then succeeds but it's too late I'm using Kubuntu 13.04 x64, I'm a complete noob at Linux and Kubuntu and have never asked a question on here before, and I have a NTFS partition on my HDD that is shared with a Windows 8.1 partition as a data drive.\nWhen I set my path variables to my home folder directory to the partition, it works perfectly, also Dropbox is set to use the drive as well and this also works perfectly.\nHowever, when I reboot my system, the paths reset to my Linux partition and Dropbox fails to access the partition. When the system has completely finished starting up, I can reset both the paths and Dropbox again to it without any problems.\nIs there some way to make Kubuntu mount the partition at the same time as it mounts it's own partition so I don't have to do this manually everytime I boot up?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: You can have the partition mounted at boot time by adding a line to /etc/fstab for it.\nsudo blkid #copy the UUID of the disk in question\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nAdd a new line with that UUID, and set the fs type field to ntfs and the options field to uid=1000,gid=1000.  It should look something like this:\nUUID=xxxxxx /home/wherever ntfs uid=1000,gid=1000\n\n", "Q: Streaming media to WiiMC I have spent a couple of days at this issue, and I'm seething in frustration.\nI am trying to stream my movies/music to my Wii console.\nWhen I had Windows, this was all too simple: create a profile with username and pass, know your IP, and select directories to share.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now I tried something similar to this with Samba, but it just doesn't work. I tried everything. I tried a few tutorials which ended up making ubuntu freeze and refuse to boot (re-install).\n\n*I also tried seriio, which I couldn't get to work after numerous tutorials.\n\n*Finally I tried vlc with vlc-shares. I had some success. I got it to run, but it will only let me stream from /root not expansion drive :( . I tried to put a movie on my SSD and it didn't work anyway.\n\n\nI am at a total loss as what to do now. I am by no means a total newbie at networking, just new to Linux. I would appreciate it greatly if someone could guide me in the right direction.\n\nA: I would recommend installing the GUI for Samba (if you haven't already) by searching for \"samba\" in the Ubuntu Software Center, or by installing the \"system-config-samba\" package with this command:\nsudo apt-get install system-config-samba\n\nThen start start samba with the following command:\nsudo system-config-samba\n\nThen create a new share, give it a folder and make it accessible to \"everyone\". Then create a new user.\nSelect your own username in the drop-down menu \"Unix Username\"\nThen enter a Windows username and Samba password. These two, along with your computers IP-address are the settings you enter in WiiMC under SMB Share.\n(Keep in mind that you can't stream videos with a quality higher than 480p, because the Wii simply isn't strong enough.)\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.10 no launcher and no dash appears I've the same issue in the question here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears\n\n*Launcher and panel missing [ubuntu 13.04]\nIt might be a duplicate question.\nBut none of these answers work in ubuntu 13.10\nDo anyone have any ideas to fix this issue in 13.10 ?

I am combining an usb sound card with a cubieboard2, within a head casing containing two microphones! Binaural microphone! Thats just the basic jist at least ;p\nI am currently using Lubuntu 12.10 v1.05 a20 nand image. My goal here is to load alsa-firmware into a Tascam US122 usb audio interface(test unit) While we wait for our own designed sound card to be completed!\nI am specifically having an issue with usx2yloader within alsa-firmware. At least I THINK that is the problem! This same process worked perfect on my desktop ubuntu install. I am following this guide Tascam US122 ubuntu community. The guide is slightly old, as far as the old firmware and link go, but I have worked out that problem already.\nRemember this is all using Lubuntu Cubieboard2 a20 image! This is NOT i386     compatible! Armhf please =D\nSo... After I run this command, with the proper paths, the firmware loads into the Tascam.\n$ sudo fxload -s /path/to/ld2-ezusb.hex -I /usr/share/alsa/firmware/usx2yloader/us122fw.ihx -D /proc/bus/usb/002/003\n\nAfter this I am supposed to run usx2yloader but I get this error.\n$ sudo usx2yloader\nsudo: usx2yloader: command not found\nI know this looks like a simple fix but it is a lot harder than I could have forseen! As far as I know, you cant just simply install or sudo apt-get install usx2yloader. I have tried to just extract alsa-firmare, cd /usx2yloader and make doesnt work.\n$ make\nmake: Nothing to be done for `all'.\n\nI will install alsa-firmware now and give you the output. Please keep in mind that my alsa install is currently 1.0.25 so i normally would get the alsa-firmware that matches it. Note: I have tried several different alfa-firmware packages such as 1.0.27(current), 1.0.25(same as my Lubuntu installed alsa and alsa-tools) and 1.0.16(the same as my ubuntu desktop install, which was successfull and the Tascam is currently on with a solid green light).

I decided to try and install alsa-tools using alsa-project downloads latest tar file. I removed alsa-tools then downloaded and installed the latest alsa-tools tar package from alsa-tools.  The folder I extracted alsa-tools into did not have a configure file so I searched usx2yloader/ within alsa-tools/ and I found I could configure that separately.\n$ sudo apt-get remove alsa-tools\n$ cd /Downloads/alsa-tools-1.0.27/usx2yloader\n$ ./configure;make;makeinstall\n\nDuring configure I got this error\nchecking for libasound... no\n\nSo I downloaded libasound2 and libasound2-dev`.\nsudo apt-get install libasound2 libasound2-dev\n\n(I also had to run this command to be able to install libasound2 and libasound2-dev. I'm not sure this applies to everyone.)\nsudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8\n\nAfter installing libasound2 and libasound2-dev I was able to ./configure && make && make install usx2yloader and thus solve this topic!!!\nNote: I tried installing libasound2 and libasound2-dev BEFORE alsa-tools via apt-get but I still needed to get alsa-tools and install usx2yloader separately.\nThank you for your help CL.! You pointed me in the right direction!\n", "Q: Are the Gufw default profiles empty? I've just installed gufw on my notebook. I'm trying to setup my laptop with a very secure - roadwarrior - type of configuration. So the choices available in GUFW with a public, home and office profile look very promising.\nBut then I got worried. Because enabling these profiles didn't do very much, rather nothing at all. I've looked in the documentation, but it seems to me that it isn't very well documented. Any suggestions what would be a good setup for the public/home/office profiles?\n\nA: Each user need really different rules from another user (P2P, games, servers...). That is the reason for no rules in the preconfigured profiles.\nIn your home, you'll safe by your router then, the preconfigured policies will be allow.\nIn a public profile the default policies will be more restricted because you'll into the wild ;)\nBest regards :)\n", "Q: indicator-datetime stops the disk from spinning down I'm running Ubuntu 13.10 on a laptop, and have laptop-mode-tools installed.\nI've noticed that, while running on battery, the laptop's hard disk is not spinning down successfully.\nAbout every five seconds, the disk starts spinning down but then something makes it spin back up again.\nI've investigated this a bit (with the help of Google), and found some things:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've installed and run iotop.

For example, before 6 I'll have Chrome open on my external monitor at a certain position with a certain resolution. After 6 I'll have it maximised on my laptop screen.\nWould I need to append something after $ chrome to do this or would another method be used?\n\nA: You can use wmctrl to specify any window geometry and placement.\nThen you can put each app launch in a script and launch it : chrome.sh instead of just chrome.\n", "Q: For what I have \"Public\", \"Templates\" and \"Examples\" in my home directory? What is the purpose of  \"Public\", \"Templates\" and \"Examples\" directories in my home directory? What should I put in there? And is ok if I delete them? If yes, then when I create them again they will have the same icons?\n\nA: Searching on this forum fetched me the purpose of the following:\n\n*\n\n*public folder: The folder is used for sharing files publicly, so your files won't be exposed.\n\n*templates folder: To provide a basic skeleton for frequently used contents.\n\nThe \"examples\" folder is acutally a soft link(a shortcut, in Windows terms) pointing to the /usr/share/example-content/ folder, probably to provide you files to test your video and audio cards and if you have the necessary applications and drivers to run audio and video files.\nIts ok if you delete the \"public\" and \"templates\" folder and recreate them manually as you create any other folder, but remember to create in your /home/$USER/ directory; they will have the same icons. However, the \"examples\" file will have to be created using the terminal(open a terminal using Ctrl+Alt+t) and typing ln -s /usr/share/example-content/ Examaples. This command creates a soft link to the /usr/share/example-content/ folder(the original folder).\n", "Q: wifi scanning results say No scan results I'm trying to use wifi access in Ubuntu 12.04 and for some reason, I do not want to use network-manager.

It was an internal card and the system detected it. The drivers were loaded, but it found no wireless networks.\nIt was an antenna issue. I connected the antenna leads and it worked.\n\nA: There are two possible drivers for your device, the native brcmsmac and bcmwl-kernel-source, also known as the STA driver. STA creates a wireless interface eth1 and not wlan0. Is the result the same if you try:\nsudo iwlist eth1 scan\n\nMoreover, depending on your Ubuntu version one or the other driver works better.\n\nA: Try switching your wifi on using the manual button you have on your keyboard, or a manual switch.\nThis solved my wifi issue.\nIf it doesn't show the wifi driver or issues with the driver, then you can install the drivers first and disable secure boot.\n", "Q: will a 6GB of RAM will be fine and efficiant to run in 32-bit Ubuntu? I am using Ubuntu 13.10 in a Intel Dual Core 3 GHz processor with 2 GB of RAM and I would like to buy a 4 GB of RAM extra and what best I can use it more efficiently and how I am supposed to achieve that ?\nMy Plan is to run some Database Server.\n\nA: \nWill a 6GB of RAM will be fine and efficiant to run in 32-bit Ubuntu?\n\nYes. But 2 will be sufficient to run Ubuntu too. Ubuntu defaults to the PAE kernel for 4Gb+ support on 32 bits so you will be fine. PAE has a maximum of 64Gb.\n\nMy Plan is to run some Database Server.\n\nA database server will benefit from more memory. But it is impossible for us to answer if it runs efficiently since this is very very dependent on the amount of users, bandwidth, and a lot more. Memory is just a small facet in this. \n\nA: In order to be able to utilize all 6GB of RAM with the generic Linux kernel, you will have to install a 64-bit edition of Ubuntu. 32-bit systems are only able to exploit 4GB of RAM (at most).\nAnother option, if you want to keep the 32-bit OS, is to use a PAE (physical address extension) kernel that will allow the OS to \"see\" more than 4GB of RAM, but in order for this to work, your CPU must also support PAE.\nI does not matter what RAM you will buy, as long as frequencies conform to what your processor supports.\n", "Q: How can I drop a specific packet from my netwirk traffic using Wireshark Ubuntu How can I drop a specific packet from my network traffic using Wireshark Ubuntu\n\nA: You can configure firewall i.e. ufw in Ubuntu to block or allow particular type of traffic in Ubuntu or can also use iptables.\nWireshark cannot be used to block traffic as it is used as a network sniffer not a particular type of traffic blocker.\nFor more info on ufw see:\nCommunity ufw Documentation\n", "Q: Is there any problem if i copy ubuntu partition to any other partiotions? is there any problem if i copy ubuntu partition and paste it to another patition and deleted the original ubuntu partition using gparted from live usb\n\nA: I don't exactly get what your trying to say, but I'm guessing you want to reinstall Ubuntu to a different partition and keep all of your settings, programs and files.\nSo what you should do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up your Ubuntu installation and create a back-up using the back-up utility you can find in the System Settings.\n\n*Shut down after backing up your system and boot up the live-usb.\n\n*Go in to Live Mode and start GParted.\n\n*MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING BACKED UP and then delete your existing Ubuntu partition.

I can't get the setup working propely because the monitor settings get reverted every time I reboot.\nHow do I fix this?\nNote that I get the initial settings when I start nvidia-settings after a logout/reboot.\n\nA: Okay I got it working: You have to change the display settings in system settings -> display as well.\nNow everything works like a charm!\n\nA: The only solution for me was dconf-editor, and search for xrandr using Ctrl-F.\nDisable the following keys:\norg.cinnamon.settings-daemon.plugins.xrandr.active = false\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xrandr.active = false\n\nRemove the old monitors.xml:\nrm ~/.config/monitors.xml\n\nThen setup the montiors with sudo nividia-settings. After that apply settings and save Xorg.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\nReboot, and it should work.\n\nA: Add nvidia-settings --load-config-only (see man page) to your startup programs, that should apply your settings each time you login.\nWhat's happening here is that nvidia-settings correctly saves your settings to ~/.nvidia-settings.rc, but can't reapply them after a restart unless run. \nSince you probably don't want to see its window every time you login, the --load-config-only switch tells it to load the existing config, apply it and exit.\n\nA: I solved this problem with following steps.\nmv ~/.config/monitors.xml ~/.config/monitors.xml.bak\n\nThat monitors.xml overrides xorg.conf every time reboot.\nsudo nvidia-settings\n\nthen set you want, save the file to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/xorg.conf\nThat's it. This should solve your problem.\n\nA: It could be that lightdm is overriding you setting. See this answer here.\n", "Q: How to install CPU Sim I have recently switched from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 12.04.

In the near future (probably in the year end sale season), I am going to buy a Dell laptop. Problem is, I am completely pissed off by Microsoft Windows 8, which is almost universally pre-installed in Dell computers. I've heard that there are some desktops/laptops that you can buy from Dell with Ubuntu pre-installed. But, I didn't find such desktop/laptops in Dell official site.\nWhere is the access point to buy the desktop/laptop from Dell with a pre-installed Ubuntu system?

Which is to some extend. Namely, I want to have the touchpad differently configured then the mouse and ...\nWhen I have an (USB) mouse attached I use it normally left-handed. Therefore I switch the buttons to left-handed. But when I use the touchpad I feel little bit lost with that kind of configuration. Therefore I wanna have it right-handed.\nIs there a way to achieve the following: when I plugin a mouse (respectively when it is detected) automatically switch to left-handed and when I unplug it, switch automatically to right-handed?\n\nA: I understand your frustration, but this problem can be solved very simple with the help of xinput tool.\nFirst plug in your USB mouse, then run the following command:\nxinput list\n\nto see the id of your mouse. The output of above command it can be similar to:\nxinput | cat\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ USB Mouse                                 id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ...\nIn the above example the USB mouse has id=11. We will use this id in the following command which will swap buttons to be left handed only for the USB mouse (and not for tauchpad):\nxinput set-button-map 11 3 2 1\n\nIn general:\nxinput set-button-map id 3 2 1\nTo revert the change, use:\nxinput set-button-map id 1 2 3\nTo make the change permanently, add the following command at Startup Applications (search in Dash for Startup Applications):\nsh -c \"xinput set-button-map id 3 2 1\"\nUpdate:\nSince the id might change after reboot but the name of the USBmouse not, you could also grep for the name of the mouse and apply it. To skip the details reg. picking out the name the final solution looks like:\nfor id in `/usr/bin/xinput list | /bin/grep 'USB Mouse' | /bin/grep -o [0-9][0-9]`; do xinput set-button-map $id 3 2 1; done;\npack it into the above mentioned Startup Applications you'll get finally:\nsh -c \"for id in `/usr/bin/xinput list | /bin/grep 'USB Mouse' | /bin/grep -o [0-9][0-9]`; do xinput set-button-map $id 3 2 1; done;\"\n\nA: There's an even simpler way than in Radu Rădeanu's answer. xinput accepts the name of the input device as an alternative to its numerical ID. Since your USB mouse is probably treated generically, it's name is most likely USB Mouse. Therefore you likely don't even need to run xinput list.\nThus your xinput set-button-map, with this name in place of the numeric ID, becomes:\nxinput set-button-map \"USB Mouse\" 3 2 1\n\nThis takes the place of xinput set-button-map id 3 2 1 and should achieve the same thing, with 3 2 1 making it a left-handed mouse, just like when the numeric ID way is used. (And replacing 3 2 1 with 1 2 3 will still work to switch it to being a right-handed mouse.)\nThis has the advantage that, provided it works initially, it will continue to work across reboots, without having to obtain the device's ID number using long, complex commands.\n\nA: I found that the startup command in the other answer only works if the id is a two digit number. Here are my modifications which should work for both one and two digit numbers:\nIn Startup Applications\nbash -c \"for id in `/usr/bin/xinput list | /bin/grep 'USB Mouse' | /bin/grep -o id=[0-9][0-9]*`; do xinput set-button-map ${id:3} 3 2 1; done;\"\n\n\nA: device_id=$(/usr/bin/xinput list \\\n            | /bin/grep 'slave  pointer' \\\n            | /bin/grep 'Wireless Keyboard&Mouse' \\\n            | tr \" \" \"\\n\" \\\n            | /bin/grep \"id=\" \\\n            | /bin/grep -o [0-9][0-9]* \\\n        )\n/usr/bin/xinput set-button-map $device_id 3 2 1 \n\nHere is a more verbose solution that solves two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*It works for device ids with any number of digits (same as @robbie solution, but written a bit different)\n\n*Considers that the device name may be duplicated. In my case, I have a wireless mouse + keyboard, so xinput list shows 2 entries with the same name (\"2.4G Wireless Keyboard&Mouse\") except one says \"[slave pointer (2)]\" and the other says \"[slave keyboard (3)]\". So with @reedstrm solution I had this error \"There are multiple devices named '2.4G Wireless Keyboard&Mouse'.\", while with @Radu Rădeanu solution, the for was iterating over 2 ids, one for the mouse and one for the keyboard, having a \"device has no buttons\" error message with the second.\n\n", "Q: Compilation error /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lz I encountered with this error while attempted compiling fasta36 on my Ubuntu 12.04.3 64 bit machine:\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lz\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake: *** [fasta36] Error 1\n\nI used following command:\nmake -f ../make/Makefile.linux64_sse2\n\nI guessed it could be due to absence or broken symbolic link so tried to find the correct file.

Newer computers use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) instead. GPT supports up to 128 partitions by default, with no equivalent to the MBR primary/extended/logical distinction. The symptoms you report suggest that you're using MBR, but if you're using GPT, you won't be able to create extended or logical partitions, and whatever your problem is, it has a more obscure cause.

The problem is that your system is using your intergrated intel GPU instead. Intel GPU's doesn't require any drivers at all, they just work. So for a Linux system this is ideal.  \nIf you want to use your nvidia chipset, you will need to manually install the driver. But before your going to install a driver you should be aware of something that may have a very big influence on your graphics setup, Nvidia Optimus.\nNvidia optimus is a technology that controls the use of multiple graphics drivers.\nSo if you are browsing the internet is switches to your intel gpu for low power.\nand when your gaming at high res it switches to nvidia for max preformance.\nI suspect that your laptop is using Optimus because of your two diffrent GPU's (Intel and nvidia). Mainly because my own laptop has a similar setup (intel i5 with geforce gt 630m).\nNow Optimus is not supported for linux by nvidia, but there is a third party solution that works just fine for me called Bumblebee. to install bumblebee:\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia \n\nmake sure you purge your system from any half-installed nvidia drivers.\nafter a reboot you can use your nvidia chipset by:\noptirun Your_Program_name_here\n\nthat's about it let us know if this did or didn't work,Good luck!\n", "Q: Kernel panic - possible due to IR reciever?

I have a Fujitsu LifeBook T900, and I have a problem with Ubuntu on it. This laptop has a touch screen meant to be used with an accompanying stylus (i.e. it only works with the stylus, and not with finger input). Under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (which this laptop previously ran), input with the stylus always worked flawlessly. However, since doing a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10, the screen stops responding to stylus input after I suspend the laptop and wake it up again (the keyboard and touchpad continue working though). This means if I want to handwrite notes or draw on my laptop, I need to restart my machine if I have closed the lid, which is pretty annoying.\nSo, my question is this: if I were to file a bug report for this behavior, which package should I file it against? Perhaps it could also be useful if somebody could tell me what I should include in the report which would make it more useful.\n\nA: Input-related issues generally have to do with X.org (also known as X11, also known as X server).\nHowever, this might be a kernel bug, as the symptoms occur only after suspension. The problem may be that the kernel fails to wake up your device.\nTherefore I'd report a bug against Linux:\nubuntu-bug linux\n\nThat command will attach many useful information about your hardware that will help figuring out what's wrong.

I've tried connecting to an open network too. My wireless adapter light blinks at a constant rate when it's not getting enough power and it's doing that on 12.04.1. The adapter has 2 usbs connected to its mini-b connector goes into the adapter; one main usb that holds the data and another which I presume it to be a power cable, I'm guessing they're connected in parallel for higher current? As for ubuntu 12.04.1 I think that it's not recognizing the second usb as a device so it limits the current to a minimum to save power.

There's no monolithic One Way To Do Things in Linux, no mandate from above, and the well-written guidelines (e.g., http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HighQuality-Apps-HOWTO/fhs.html which explain why take some time to find and read.  \n/bin, /usr/bin, /sbin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local, /usr/local/bin, /opt, /opt/bin and /usr/games all can contain executables, and echo $PATH shows you the directories which are automatically searched on your system when an app is entered in CLI mode.  Instead, Synaptic package manager is the way to go to find app executables; search on the app you want, and Synaptic will show you where the app's executable is. \nIf you do not have Synaptic, open a terminal window and do sudo apt-get -y install synaptic to add it. \n\nA: In addition to the locations that kiloseven has listed, you can also find installed apps in /usr/share/applications.  \nAnother way to Open With is to right click on the desired file, and choose Open With, and then pick the application or choose Other Application, and click on Show other applications, and browse for more.

Is there a way we can remove everything and just turn on the pc with new usb inserted and things will load in fresh from there? \n\nA: You have to insert the usb with the computer off. Then turn it on and enter the BIOS as soon as possible at the start up (sometimes pressing the F8 or Esc or F12, depending on your machine, it usually tells you what key to press at the splash screen (when the mainboard/processor manufacturer logo appears). Once inside the BIOS go to the boot device priority and tell it to boot from the USB stick. In some cases the USB stick does not appear as Removable Device but appears as Hard Disk Drive, double check just in case. Save and Exit. Then your machine should boot from the USB. Once in Live Ubuntu, install the OS and choose the option to use the whole HDD (not to upgrade/use along other prior OS).\n", "Q: gsettings-qt bug?

I assume you're storing the color as a \"(yyyy)\" (corresponding to rgba)? When reading that tuple, gsettings-qt doesn't know that this is supposed to be a QColor.\n(Btw: you're getting [undefined] because gsettings-qt doesn't even handle tuples. I forget why, but maybe because QVariant is lacking a tuple type?)\nIs this for an application? I think the SDK guys are working on a settings API that is a bit more friendly to Qt-types.\n", "Q: How to see if wxpython is installed? I would like to know how can i determine if wxpython is installed on ubuntu 12.04?\nAnd i would like to know as well if ubuntu 12.04 already has wxpython installed by default?\n\nA: To see if wxpython is installed we may try to import it in the Python interpreter:\n>>> import wx\n\nIn a script, we can also check for wxpython with:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\ntry:\n    import wx\nexcept ImportError:\n    print('wxpython is not installed')\n\nIn Ubuntu wxpython is not installed by default but we can easily install the basic Python modules (need 35.1 MB of disk space)  with:\nsudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-wxtools\n\nStill, additional packages may be needed for other applications.

Everytime I've done that I've had to reinstall ubuntu all over again because nothing I put in will work. It keeps asking for authentication on EVERYTHING!! I can't even do a simple search of MY OWN FILES AND PROGRAMS without being prompted for a password.\nI did a format and reinstall recently and I didn't have this problem until something popped up asking for my password for a keyring. I saw this A LOT before I reinstalled but it wouldn't let me install some software I needed until I did. Ever since, this stupid keyring thing is ALWAYS asking for a password.\n\nA: If you use auto-login and your keyring password is different than your login password you can remove the keyring password in „Passwords and Encryption Keys“:\n\nThere should be entries listing different passwords. Right click there and change the password. If not, check the settings:\n\nFor using sudo without being prompted for a password, you might use an USB Flash Drive USB Flash Drive for authentication:\n apt-get install libpam-usb pamusb-tools\n pamusb-conf --add-device YourUSB\n pamusb-conf --add-user Username\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to download all of my Ubuntu One files? So, I have Ubuntu One on my mac, and is synced with the Ubuntu One website. I have folders within folders, within folders, and so on. If I needed to (If, I got a new computer, for example), would it be possible to download everything from the website in a big compressed file (zip, tar.gz, 7z, etc.)? If not, how would I go about downloading all of the files from the website to my hard drive?\n\nA: If you simply install the Ubuntu One client on the new computer, log in with it to your account, and subscribe to all the folders you have on the server, it will download everything to the new machine.\nThere is no way to download all your data directly from the web site currently, via a zip or similar file.\nAlso note that Ubuntu One is more than only a file sync service, as there is also u1db for synchronization of structured data, which apps can use, and which may not be directly accessible via the web site at all, depending on what data is stored there. Accessing any data from apps which use u1db will also require installing them and associating them to your Ubuntu One account, so that they can sync up on the new machine.\n", "Q: GRUB UEFI windows boot fail I've read about this, but still can't figure out my problem.\nI've got a new laptop with windows 8 preinstalled. First thing I did was installing ubuntu, then GRUB, as I always did. Now I can boot Ubuntu, but not windows.\nWhile the machine starts I get this message:\nFailed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\grubx64.efi - 80000000000000E\nFailed to load grub\nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - 80000000000000E\nFailed to load grub\nChecking media [FAIL]\nChecking media [FAIL]\n\nThen GRUB shows up with 4 options\nUbuntu\nAdvanced Settings for Ubuntu\nWindows Boot Manager (UEFI on /dev/sda1)\nSystem setup\n\nSelecting Ubuntu goes fine, but selecting windows outputs this message:\n/EndEntire\nfile path: /ACPI(a0....)/PCI... etc.\nerror: cannot load image.\n\nand it returns to GRUB menu.\nI've read, that installing GRUB with UEFI isn't a good idea. I always had BIOS.\nI can change the boot option to UEFI secure mode off and Legacy secure mode off. The second one says there are no boot images. How should I repair my bootloader so that I can choose between Ubuntu and Windows?\n\nA: First, disable Secure Boot. It sounds like you may have tried this already, but that's not quite 100% clear from your question.\nSecond, as user207507 suggests, Boot Repair may be able to fix the problem. This isn't guaranteed, though, and in rare cases it can even render Ubuntu unbootable. (Making a backup of your EFI System Partition can provide you with a way back in case you have this problem.)\nThird, you might try my rEFInd boot manager. You can try the USB flash drive or CD-R image (both available on the downloads page) without installing rEFInd to your hard disk. If you can boot both Ubuntu and Windows that way, try installing the Debian package in Ubuntu.\nIf these suggestions don't work, then please post back with the URL that Boot Repair generates. That will give us more detailed information about your system that will be helpful in diagnosing the problem.\n\nA: Search for the Boot-Repair cd. And boot live. I've used this often when installing win7 after Ubuntu when dual booting. It brings back the correct options in Grub. \n\nA: The problem you are experiencing is related to SecureBoot rather than UEFI as such and seems to be a known critical bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1091464.\nYou will find a number of workarounds under this link. The best one would be to use a SecureBoot-compatible loader such as shim or PREloader.

Since the upgrade to Kubuntu 13.10 today I lost the borders around maximized windows. How can I re-enable them? I tried this and of course changed true to false, but it doesn't work.\n\nA: The ability to show borders on maximized windows was removed from kwin in KDE 4.11.  You can find more information about this decision in bug 299245.  Basically, the implementation was a hack that caused multiple bugs, and the developer said that the proper place for this feature was in the decoration rather than in kwin.\nSo, this feature was added to the oxygen window decoration.  Unfortunately, this change has not made it into a stable KDE release yet.  Once released, the option will be available by going to System Settings->Workspace Appearance.  Then, if you're using the oxygen decoration, you'll be able to click on the 'Configure Decoration' button, go to the 'Fine Tuning' tab, and check 'Display window borders for maximized windows'.\n", "Q: Can I remove a category from the Dash-home When I type something in the dash-home the system searches the internet and displays choices from there.

It was thinked for being used in GNOME 2 (as can be seen in the above screenshots). I would recommend you to check GTK 3.x themes instead. Also, you must use themes that has an instruction, in this case the theme was supposed to go in the ~/.theme directory.\n\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 PROBLEM I have spent the past 4 days trying to get Ubuntu and Windows 7 on my computer and every time it boots straight into Ubuntu. I have looked through most of the threads and tried Windows first, Ubuntu first, partitioning the drive, reinstall grub with boot - repair, pretty much every tutorial I can find, I only have one USB drive to boot off of, so this is very time consuming. I have to download the iso file and create a bootable USB everytime I install an OS and it's all for nothing because there is no boot menu.

They are links to Excel-Writer-XLSX and the perl module:\nhttp://search.cpan.org/~jmcnamara/Excel-Writer-XLSX/\nhttp://jmcnamara.github.io/excel-writer-xlsx/\nThere is a post on this question here: Also a caveat against someone installing through a PPA (command line)due to not having all the files compatible together, I think.

You can mount the usb onto the 12.04 system, and edit the file /mnt/sdb?/boot/grub/grub.cfg and change all the hd0 occurrences to \nhd1.  Then try boot the usb.  If successful, you can run update-grub as above and get the 12.04 system added to the usb grub menu. The uuids on the usb will not have changed,so should still be good.

How can I download alternative fonts to use in Libre Office Writer? I'm looking for cursive fonts in particular.\n\nA: LibreOffice will read all installed fonts in /usr/share/fonts/, which is where fonts packages will be installed by the Software Center, and are accessible to all users (except if it is a LaTeX font package, but that's another story).\nAdditionally, if you copy/download individual fonts, you can put them in your ~/.fonts/ folder (or double click on the font file and click the button \"Install Font\"), which will make them available only to the current user. You can use these fonts in LibreOffice too.\n\nIf ~/.fonts/ does not exist, you can create it from the file explorer or from command line:\nmkdir ~/.fonts\n\n\nA: Fonts that you download from the internet (ttf and otf files) can be installed and used in LibreOffice Writer and other programs by placing them in the /home/<your username>/.local/share/fonts directory. If it does not exist you will need to create it. Though there's no need to muck around in a terminal or copy files around.

Today I was using rsync over a slow internet connection to transfer a video file - uncompressed avi, 60 seconds duration, 360MB in size. Basically it contained 1500 frames of the same image, hence it was highly compressible.\nTop upload speed on my internet connection is 130KB/s. I ran rsync like this:\nrsync -avhz --progress --partial myfile.avi remote:/path/\n\nThe transfer speed varied from 400KB/s to 1,5MB/s. I accidentially Ctrl+C'd the running rsync after the file was about halfway transferred. But no worries, I used --partial switch, so I just restarted rsync with the same parameters as before. Only that now the transfer speed was 80MB/s!\nI tried this again, and again and again. Even without the -z switch, the result was the same. On the first run, the transfer speed was a shy 1,5MB/s, but after interrupting rsync after a while and restarting it, the rest of the file was transferred almost instantaneously. The md5sum matched on both ends.\nMy question is: can anyone explain this behaviour to me? Am I missing something obvious here? I would expect that file would be transferred much faster already with -z switch on the first go, but I wouldn't expect it to speed up so drastically without even using -z after resuming the transfer.\n\nA: man rsync\nFrom description:\n\"It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination.\"\nSo the speed you got indicated more or less how quick rsync could confirm that the file was already transferred or confirm and transfer the changed/missing parts.\n", "Q: which radeon driver do I get? I have updated my Ubuntu kernel to 3.12 so I can take advantage of updated DPM.\nI am trying to find firmware for my radeon from this website\nhttp://people.freedesktop.org/~agd5f/radeon_ucode/\nI did a lspci | grep VGA\nand I get this\n01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RS880M [Mobility Radeon HD 4225/4250]\n\nWhich firmware do I use so that I can add it to /lib/radeon\n\nA: First of all, do not touch /lib. Second, you might want to check modinfo radeon to check what driver/module are you using. If you installed the 3.12 kernel you are most likely using already the latest driver.\n\nA: The ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4225/4250 is a RV610/630 chipset, so you will only need R600_rlc.bin. However, from what I can tell (based on the file modification times), Ubuntu 13.10 already includes the latest firmware for R610/R630.\nI think you may only need to enable DPM from the kernel command line, since DPM is not enabled by default.

I'm far from an expert and completely new to the server side of things...\nPreviously the whole system worked fine but i've been having issues with the feed to my monitor.\nI've tried a couple of reinstalls, a couple of resets and even put in a new 2TB HDD last night and did a fresh install onto the new second HDD. The install went well. On the final reboot stage when I remove the CD and press 'continue' the system shuts down prior to the reboot, then sounds like it's rebooting (system beeps etc.) but my monitor feed goes black - no feedback, no CPU/system splach screen... nothing. The monitor shows the 'no signal' message but the VGA cable is connected and tested on my laptop and works fine.\nIt did this a couple of days ago so I did a reset with the button on the case and then after a couple of goes it worked fine... last night I shutdown to install the new HDD and it wouldn't boot again.

So I had to copy it to external hard disk. How can I just copy iso file to the pen drive?\nI even tried to rename the file to exe or rar, but no hope.\n\nA: It's not the file name, or even the operating system, it's the size of the file that's the problem. The formatting of the pendrive is probably FAT32 which as per Wikipedia \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4 GiB minus 1 byte or 4,294,967,295 (2^32 − 1) bytes. FAT32 is the default filesystem for USB flash drives. You can confirm this from a terminal window with  sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdX (the value of 'X' is probably b, as the USB flash drive probably is the second drive in your system).\nNow, if you just want to move the ISO using the flash drive to carry it, you can use http://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/ , http://linux.die.net/man/1/7z , or other archival utilities to break the file into two pieces, and then carry it to your destination. If so, just use 'store' mode compression, that is to say, no compression, for the fastest operation.  Or, you could reformat the flash drive for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext2 or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS which have a file size limit of 16 TiB-1, orders of magnitude larger.\nBut, perhaps you wish to make the flashdrive bootable with that ISO? If so, then use unetbootin (installed with apt-get install -y unetbootin if your system does not have it) to create a bootable flashdrive with the contents of the ISO.\n", "Q: What should i do if my computer can't run ubuntu I downloaded both 12.04LTS and 13.04 and installed it on my computer,an acer aspire 3005wlci, but when the computer starts up it fails to boot.

I installed using a USB and on the first time, that failed for me. You should try to re-burn the iso to whatever you're trying to install it on, and then come back. \nBack? Well, it could be that your computer can't actually run Ubuntu. This can sometimes happen due to performance, but do not give up.

I installed Xubuntu 13.04 two months ago. But I don't know to find out which driver is installed for my GPU ( I mean graphic card driver ) or is it installed? I'm feeling something is wrong with my pc graphics.\n\nA: In the Xubuntu menu click on Settings Manager. This will open the Settings window.\n\nIn the Settings window under the Hardware heading, click on the Additional Drivers icon. This will open the Software & Updates window and show the Additional Drivers tab.\n\nIf you have a graphics card driver installed, there will be a black dot appearing to the left of it, showing that it is installed. The recommended graphics card driver, if there is one in the list, is the one that has [Recommended] appearing after it. You can install the Recommended driver by selecting the Recommended driver from the list of drivers, clicking the Apply Changes button in the lower right corner of Additional Drivers, and then reboot to enable the graphics card driver.\n\nA: Run sudo lshw -c video | grep 'configuration' to see the video driver used, or sudo lshw -c video for more detail. i915, for example, means your video adapter uses the Intel 915 drivers; nouveau means you have the Open Source drivers for NVIDIA.\n\nA: Click on the Ubuntu icon on the upper left corner.. then search for Additional Drivers.. click that.. wait for it to check.. and see if you have any driver checked on available.. if not .. you gotta \"activate\" meaning to install one of them.. it's better to stick with stable releases..

It instantly returned\nWebserver :\nOS :\n\nInformation like that.\n\nA: wget -qS -O- http://www.website.tld:portnumber will deliver the information to you directly for you to analyze and nmap will inspect the headers coming from a server with the command nmap -A -T4 www.website.tld (replace website.tld with the website you wish to study) and try to guess at what's running there. curl is less forthcoming, but if you do curl http://192.168.1.2:portnumber the last line returned will tell you which protocol a port expects. \nThe sysadmin of that site can block or provide misleading information, though, to make it tougher for script kiddies to perform attacks-from-a-can.\n", "Q: Why so many Virtual consoles? What is the reason for having so many virtual consoles?\nI would understand if there was one in case the GUI crashes but 6 more besides the default? What are they for? I even see no usage for any of them except when the GUI freezes.\n\nA: The practicality is real. There can be multiple programs running simultaneously in the truly multi-user Linux system, and you can drop in to check on each one if each one runs in its own virtual terminal. When you log in to each one, you can log in as different users, if needed. Now, granted, many folks arrive at Linux with a single-user perspective, but since Linux was born multi-user, that capability was never discarded.\n\nA: Short answer: why not? (implied smile, please) \nMore lengthy one: it is mostly a history thing, I suppose. There were 6 virtual consoles configured with getty in the first linux I booted with VC support, I really forgot when (it was around 1990, I think). Then when you started the graphical environment (by hand, with startx) it opened itself on the first free VC, which happened to be #7. And I still did most of my work on VCs at the time: the editors were much faster and sometime I used more VCs than the standard six, and my laptop was not exactly a graphic monster...\nFor example, I used to run three editors (a program, its input data, a TeX file describing it), one VC for compiling, another to read a manual, and another one connected via telnet to my mail server.  \nI suspect that the rationale for still using six virtual consoles is to let the graphic VC on #7 for everyone, so you can write on manuals \"Ctrl-Alt-F7\" and not \"Ctrl-Alt-Fx where  x is the first free VC\". \nAs a side note, you can (I suppose --- never tried) trim down the VCs. Simply do \nsudo bash -c \"echo 'manual' >> /etc/init/tty6.override\"\n\nto stop VC#6, following the upstart manual.  \n\nA: All of the /dev/tty* entries are something known as device file, in accordance with Unix philosophy. They serve as a link between user and actual device, but their purpose may differ slightly.\nHow virtual consoles allocated\nPer console(4) manual:\n\nBefore kernel version 1.1.54 the number of virtual consoles was compiled into the kernel (in tty.h: #define NR_CONSOLES 8) and could be changed by editing and recompiling. Since version 1.1.54 virtual consoles are created on the fly, as soon as they are needed.\n\nDynamic creation in pre-systemd systems is controlled via /etc/default/console-setup variable ACTIVE_CONSOLES. From console-setup(5) manual:\n\nACTIVE_CONSOLES Specifies the device files in /dev of the virtual\n  terminals to be configured. File name wild-cards (*, ?) are allowed.\n  On Linux usually you can set this to /dev/tty[1-6] and on FreeBSD a\n  sensible value is /dev/ttyv[0-8]. You can assign to this variable also\n  the special value guess. It will cause setupcon(1) to attempt to guess\n  the active virtual consoles by looking in configuration files such as\n  /etc/inittab and /etc/ttys. This guessing is not always reliable.\n\nSystemd configuration relies on /etc/systemd/logind.conf variable NAutoVTs. Quote from logind.conf documentation\n\nNAutoVTs=\n  Takes a positive integer. Configures how many virtual terminals (VTs) to allocate by default that, when switched to and are previously unused, \"autovt\" services are automatically spawned on. These services are instantiated from the template unit autovt@.service for the respective VT TTY name, for example, autovt@tty4.service. By default, autovt@.service is linked to getty@.service. In other words, login prompts are started dynamically as the user switches to unused virtual terminals. Hence, this parameter controls how many login \"gettys\" are available on the VTs. If a VT is already used by some other subsystem (for example, a graphical login), this kind of activation will not be attempted. Note that the VT configured in ReserveVT= is always subject to this kind of activation, even if it is not one of the VTs configured with the NAutoVTs= directive. Defaults to 6. When set to 0, automatic spawning of \"autovt\" services is disabled.\n\nDecreasing appropriate variable for your environment and rebooting will help decreasing the number of VTs. Deleting those devices can be done manually via this command:\nsudo bash -c 'for num in $(seq 10 63 ) ; do MAKEDEV -v -d \"tty$num\" ; done'\n\nThis , however, is somewhat pointless - the device files do not take up any space and don't influence system performance. \nSee also https://askubuntu.com/a/27975/295286\nVirtual consoles general info\nDevice files like /dev/tty123 can be used to interact with the system via regular shell.Those are virtual terminals. Ubuntu system is configured to open by default TTY 1 through 6 , but one can manually open more, for example:\nsudo openvt -c 9 -s \"bash\"\n\nThat will open bash as root on /dev/tty9 and immediately switch you to that TTY ( if done on local terminal, but if you do so via remote ssh session, in which case you may need to use chvt 9 , where 9 is /dev/tty9 in this example).　To do the same without sudo as non-root, you will have to change ownership of tty you want to open. For example,\n$ sudo chown admin_user:tty /dev/tty8 \n$ openvt -c 8 -l \n\nThat would log me in with my default shell on tty8. In my tests, however, it seems that this works via TTY only, so if you're doing that via terminal emulator, that might not work ( I was getting Couldn't get a file descriptor referring to the console\n error and only sudo openvt -c 8 -l worked for me from emulator )\nFrom historical standpoint, before all the fancy terminal multiplexers were created, this was a useful feature - you could spawn up to 62 commands ( maybe servers ) on those consoles, and let them run, while working in 63rd. Nowadays, it might not be as necessary.\nThere are multiple device files created by default. Active ones are 1 through 6,  but one can alter their number by editing /etc/default/console-setup, specifically this part:\n# Setup these consoles.  Most people do not need to change this.\nACTIVE_CONSOLES=\"/dev/tty[1-6]\"\n\nttyS* devices\nThese are device files used for serial consoles , aka UART (also known as RS-232 ). In the past many computer systems would come with serial port. Nowadays, this could mostly be found on server type of computers. Multiple ttyS devices could be useful with RS-232 hubs, which allow connecting multiple devices to be managed via USB or Ethernet. \nFor electrical engineers (which is what I am majoring in in college) , we use serial port to interact with microcontrollers and development boards ( Arduino , for instance ). Single port computers , such as Raspberry Pi, also use it. Nowadays, the serial connection is established using USB to UART cable, and opening the console in terminal via screen like so:\nscreen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 # the number is baud rate or speed\n\nNote , that Arduino and Raspberry will create their own device file for serial connection, /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0\nvcs* devices\nAccording to man vcs these are console memory devices. In simple words, if you do sudo cat /dev/vcs1 you will see what's on screen in /dev/tty1 , at least up to maximum amount of lines in that terminal.\n\nA: Why not more? Run top or htop in one (gives cpu/memory usages statics), ssh to other systems in 2 or 3, run some automated task in another, keep one free just in case, login to multiple users in a few more, run cmatrix on one, start the GUI in another with - \nstartx -- :1\n\n(some graphics have bugs with this)\nhttp://mostlylinux.wordpress.com/troubleshooting/ttysessions/\nWhen you really start to utilize this feature 7 tty's (the seventh one is the default)seem way to few - and you can add more.\nTo reduce the number: How can I reduce the number of TTYs?\n", "Q: Is there a program to mine bitcoins in ubuntu 13.10?

I have Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 12.04 on it. The way I installed my OSes was like this:\nI installed Win 8.1 in the required partitions then Installed ubuntu and installed the boot loader in the same partition that I installed ubuntu. The previous time I did so, I used boot-repair to fix my grub so it would show both windows and ubuntu OSes and it worked. That way Windows were intact and in the case that ubuntu screw up (upgrades) or I screw up (messing with it) I wouldn't have to install Windows all over again. This time tho, boot-repair showed me a message like the following one: \nWinEFI or WinUEFI (I'm not sure which one) detected, do you want to backup and rename the files\n\nAnd like a noob that I am, I clicked yes. Now grub replaced both boot loaders, and no matter which efi entry I select from bios, I get the same grub screen. That didn't happen before, If I had ubuntu efi as primary boot entry I was getting grub and was able to select linux or windows. If I had win 8 boot entry as the primary one. I was getting pure windows.\nAnd FINALLY (I know) the question... boot-repair said that it backed up WinEFI loader or whatever. Does anyone know how I can restore it? \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: To undo & to rename files to their original names, you just need to tick the \"Restore EFI backups\" option of Boot-Repair.\nI also suggest a full backup of your efi partition.\nIt looks like boot repair ran its \"buggy\" UEFI rename function. I am not sure it is always required, but it is for those UEFI that internally hard code UEFI to only boot the Windows efi file. So Boot-Repair renames the Windows file and makes grub2's shim be the Windows file. The UEFI thinks it is booting Windows but is really booting grub2 and then from grub2 menu you can boot Windows.\nThen renamed /EFI/microsoft/boot/shimx64.efi to bootmgfw.efi\nActual Windows boot file, originally bootmgfw.efi.\n/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bkpbootmgfw.efi\nWith the renamed file you cannot directly boot Windows from UEFI menu as it really is shim.  So that is why both UEFI entries boot grub. If you can directly boot Ubuntu entry you do not need the rename.\nYou can also manually rename files by changing the bkpbootmgfw.efi back to its bootmgfw.efi name. \nAnd you should have another copy:\nWindows UEFI install should  have backup of bootmgfw.efi here:\nC:\\Windows\\Boot\\EFI\\bootmgfw.efi from a working Windows x86_64 installation.\n", "Q: Unable to format USB drive with Disks (udisks-error-quark, 0) Upon trying to make a startup disk (USB) for Ubuntu 12.04, the system prevented boot loader installation. I'm getting message:\nError synchronizing after initial wipe: Timed out waiting for object (udisks-error-quark, 0)\n\nCan I still use the startup disk?\n\nA: This has been reported as a bug.  But you can try this work around and see if it works.  Install Gparted if you don't have it installed.  If its not, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nOnce installed, open the application, and before formatting, make sure that you choose the right drive, and Unmount the disk by right clicking on the partition, and choose Unmount,  then you can use the format To option, to format it to whatever type of file system you wish. Once done click on the green check mark to apply the changes.\n\n\nA: A weird solution that worked for me where GParted did not, was to format it using Mac OS X's Disk Utility initially (not the file system I ultimately wanted). Then I was able to format it on Ubuntu to NTFS which is what I wanted, and didn't encounter any timeout. \n", "Q: Where is Ubuntu source code? How do I get the source code of the Ubuntu operating system?\nHow do I run the modified code?\nWhat programming languages ​​can be used to modify the code?\n\nA: Here's the link to the original post\n\nThe source code for ubuntu is divided up by package - from a running\n  ubuntu system you can easily retreive the source for any package by\n  doing:\napt-get source (package name)\n\nOtherwise, go to launchpad, and search up the package in question. For\n  example, here's the download page for the source code for a specific\n  version of curl: \nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl/7.21.2-4ubuntu1\nThat said, it's a lot easier if you're on a Linux system already - the\n  package sources are divided into an original source tarball plus\n  ubuntu patches, so if you don't use apt-get source, you'll need to\n  manually apply the patch to the source code. And new-style packages\n  are even divided into multiple packages.\nWhat's more, the packages are generally not designed to be\n  cross-compiled from a non-Linux system. Even if you download them and\n  open them in VS, you won't be able to build them from a Windows\n  system.\nFinally, note that not everything is in C and C++ - there are packages\n  in just about any language you can imagine. But I suppose most of them\n  could be opened in VS as text files :)\nNote: If you really, really want all of it, and I can't stress enough\n  how silly it would be to download everything just to start learning\n  about the system, you can use the debmirror tool, available in ubuntu,\n  to do this:\ndebmirror -a none \\\n          --source \\\n          -s main \\\n          -d lucid,lucid-security,lucid-updates \\\n          -r /ubuntu \\ \n          --progress \\\n          -e http \\\n          -h archive.ubuntu.com \\ ## or other ubuntu archive mirror\n          destpath\n\nThis will be an absolutely huge download. Have several tens of GBs of\n  space available. Note that this downloads only core packages - replace\n  -s main with -s main,universe,multiverse,restricted to get everything.\nOnce you have the package files, you can extract the source by running\n  dpkg-source -x on a .dsc file of interest.\n\n\nA: You need to add some server of Debian/Ubuntu too into list of this file - before\nyou are able to use the command apt-get source  :\n/etc/apt/sources.list\nsources.list is explained in man of Ubuntu:\n\nman sources.list\n\nAdd into /etc/apt/sources.list (only in case it is not written already there)\nafter :\n\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nthis one line:\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu  main restricted universe multiverse\nThen after saving and closing gedit, do:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter this you should be able to use command with any package:\n\nsudo apt-get source \n\nCheers.\n", "Q: Can't Boot An Intel Equipped Laptop From the Burned ISO For 13.10 ISP (X386) Keep getting an error message that \"This kernel requires the following features not present on this CPU: pae\".

Sometimes it doesn't.\nThis ranges from embarrassing ( posting nonsensical comments on an IRC ) to dangerous. \nHow can I shut this feature off for good? I never, never, never want the terminal to auto execute when I paste to it. \n\nA: Prior to pasting type a # then paste your line. It will not execute and you can remove the # and hit enter when the modifications have been completed.\n\nA: There's no auto execution.\nYou probably are also copying a line break (or more) after the command.\nIf you paste a command with a break, the shell (command line) thinks that you hit the break (Enter, Return) button by yourself.\n\nThis answer only explains why OP is getting the undesired behavior. However, in another answer, there is a real solution to the OP’s problem.\n\nA: One real solution is to open editing mode with ctrl-x ctrl-e and then safely paste your clipboard into your editor of choice (commonly emacs or vim). After you are done editing the command, save and exit and it will run in the command line. This is a good habit for long or complex commands, especially when pasting commit hashes into git commands, and can help you avoid some scary results in the long run.\nThe editor can be changed by setting the VISUAL and EDITOR variables (these have different meanings, see here).\n\nA: As others have mentioned, the problem occurs when the pasted text contains newline characters. With that knowledge, your question is more-or-less the same as this one on Server Fault. Different site, so I'll repeat my answer here…\nWhat you want is called 'bracketed paste', a feature that's available in some shells.\nAssuming you're using a recent version of the bash shell, you can turn it on for the current session like so:\nbind 'set enable-bracketed-paste on'\n\nNow try it out by pasting multiple lines:\necho Hello world\necho Again, I say, hello!\n\nThe shell recognises that the text was pasted (not typed), and waits with a prompt for your confirmation. If it all looks safe to proceed, hit the Enter key. If not, hit Control-C to cancel.\nIf you'd like to enable bracketed paste for every new session, add the command to your .inputrc file:\ncd ~\necho \"set enable-bracketed-paste\" >> .inputrc\n\nAnother option is to switch from bash to zsh, where bracketed paste is enabled by default. To replace your current shell with a zsh shell:\nexec zsh\n\nWith zsh, pasted text gets highlighted, which is nice. Again, hit Enter to execute the command/s or Control-C to cancel.\nIf you like zsh, and wish to make it the default shell:\nchsh -s /bin/zsh\n\n\nA: I use this alias to paste and have my command NOT-executed\nalias nonewlinepaste='history -s `xsel -b`; sleep 1; xdotool key Up 1>/dev/null'  # xsel ref. https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/96398/17671  # xdotool ref. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/267704/command-to-simulate-keyboard-input#comment1038650_267705\n\n\nA: I get around this when copying commands that are too long by typing with another editor, like Atom. For some reason, copy-pasting long commands from vim and nano can be sketchy.

Note that the user you upload as MUST have access to write to the directory.\nAssuming that the user has write permissions to /var/www, then make sure your scp command follows this general pattern, with [options] being replaced by whatever options you need:\nscp [options] /local/path user@remotehost:/remote/path\nReplace the local path and the remote path with the actual paths though.\n\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAVE THE UPLOAD IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY, DO NOT USE ~ AT ALL FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE REMOTE PATH!\n~ is a shortcut to add /home/$USER to the path if it appears at the beginning of a path, and is the exact reason you're running into this \"Uploading to Home Directory\" issue, based on your comment on your question.  Just do user@host:/var/www like I specified in my answer here for the remote path.\n", "Q: How can I undo this command? How can I undo the following command: chmod -R a+rwX /? I used it to modify some permissions, but it did not do as I had expected.\n\nA: I had a similar issue faced once.\nNow you have two options as you have changed the permission of / and a lot of services depends upon it. (Ex: most probably your sudo su must not be working etc.)\n\n\n*\n\n*The short way is to re-install your system again. This is the best way I would recommend take backup of your files and data and do a re-install.\n\n*The long way is to you will have to boot your system in recovery mode then mount the /  partition in rw mode using\nmount -o remount,rw /\nmount --all\nand then you will have to set permissions of various services manually so yes it is possible to do that but for this you need to know what are the permissions of these services in a default ubuntu working OS.\nNow in this case you may seem to change the permission of many of the services but there are chances that you may miss alot of special permissions which may cause problem in the near future.\n", "Q: mount -a works, but boot hangs on mount I have a 3 TB internal HDD (/dev/sdc) which I have formatted as NTFS and which is automatically loaded from this /etc/fstab file (note, this is an Ubuntu 13.10 OS, not a raspberry pi):\nUUID=3efd666c-495d-4e95-8094-b1157f5499f3 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1                                                                             \n# swap was on /dev/sda7 during installation\n#UUID=e167c5b7-af0d-4fd5-84de-4c8d86b0303d none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\n# Media drive\n/dev/sdc1 /home/raspi/Documents/raspi/raspi/media ntfs rw,suid,dev,auto,exec,nouser,async,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=137 0 2\n\nWith that last line included, the computer hangs when booting, then tells me that the problem is with mounting of /home/raspi/Documents/raspi/raspi/media and that I have to press s to skip, at which point Ubuntu boots up properly. Once inside, if I issue the command sudo mount -a, sdc1 gets mounted correctly. Does this problem of not being able to mount at boot have something to do with the uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=137 options?\n\nA: That's because the kernel needs the module \"ntfs\" loaded to mount an ntfs partition. And during bootup this module is not yet loaded.\nTo configure that the module is mounted add a line with \"ntfs\" to the file /etc/modules:\necho \"ntfs\" >>/etc/modules\n\nThen you can reboot the system and your partition should be mounted.\n", "Q: Cannot mount USB pendrives in 13.10 I just upgrade to 13.10, and it doesn't mount any of my pendrives that was automatically mounted in 13.04.

I get the same results in Chrome, Firefox and Epiphany browsers. Have done complete removal's and re-installs of them all and Ubuntu.  I originally had this problem in Mint, but re-installed Ubuntu, same problem\nI have this problem on 3 Ubuntu machines, 2 on 13.10 (fresh installs, not upgrades) and one on 11.10, the 11.10 dualboots windows 7 and that is what I am using now.  Only in windows can I log on to any Openid site, and only on windows can I use all Google services with out problems.  Dropbox client in Ubuntu can not connect, windows can.  \nSo Openid and Google search results time out, in firefox I get the 408 error, in chrome the oops message.  But I can log into Gmail without problems in both browsers.\nWith all of them the problem started with a change of service from my ISP (worldnet.co.nz when I moved from adsl to fiber optic or UFB).  Speed tests using speedtest.net produce similar download speed, but the Ubuntu machines are unable to do the upload tests, it just sits on 0.00 for as long as I can wait.\nOne of the machines is a laptop and it works fine when I take it else where and use other networks.  So this would appear to be a network issue, but after 2 weeks my ISP can find nothing wrong, and have completely removed any firewall protection from my connection.  My main desktop is in the DMZ zone for my router, I have a static IP address, and no fire wall running on it at present.\nWindows 7 works correctly which suggests my ISP is correct when they say it's not a problem at their end. My router does not support IPv6 and I have disabled IPv6 in one of the machines, no change.  Ubuntu updates work fine, I have no problems with apt-get.  I can browse all generic web sites like www.nzherald.co.nz or askubuntu, but I can't log into some sites.\nI have tried changing dns servers, no difference, and nslookup and dig return the expected results always.  traceroute works fine. \nCan any one help here?  \nI have installed dnsmasq. unistalled it, tried static ip, dhcp (my router is assigned static ip by my isp which changed with the new fiber connection).  Tried Google dns, my isp dns manually added, auto assigned dns.\nifconfig reports a virbr0 interface on 192.168.122.1, the rest of the machines on my router are on 192.168.0.* and I do not know where this virbr0 comes from.  Gnome boxes maybe?  All machines on the router can see each-other in files folders.\nSo to recap, a fresh wipe all data re-install does not fix it, booting of the Ubuntu 13.10 live usb shows the same problems.  Windows has no problems.\nPlease help me, as bizarrely this seems to be a problem with Ubuntu only.\nThanks,\n\nA: Ok, I finally solved the problem using plain old dumb luck and persistence.\nI have lost the link, but via many searches I came on a path to a Russian web site (translated to English by Google) where people had similar problems with a range of TP-Link routers, the same brand as my ISP provided to me.\nThe solution was to lower the MTU from it's default 1500 to 1400. Maybe higher will work, but for today I am a believer in \"Don't fix what isn't broken\"\nI hope this helps some one else :-)\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu on a Samsung Wave 2 S8530 phone that is running Bada OS?

I dont know how to install Resynthesizer in gimp.I want Resynthesizer for editing my images.Anyone please help\n\nA: In case anyone used flatpak to install the lateset GIMP (2.10.20 as of this writing), I ran the command flatpak search org.gimp.GIMP and noticed the following package available:\norg.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.Resynthesizer\nSeeing that, I ran flatpak install org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.Resynthesizer, opened up GIMP, and the new filters were available and worked as expected.\nyou can also search for all plugins avalible to install using flatpak:\nflatpak search org.gimp.GIMP.plugin\n\n\nA: For GIMP <= 2.8 the \"Resynthesizer\" plugin together with other scripts and tools (including the brilliant tool \"Heal Selection\") can easily be installed with the package gimp-plugin-registry\nFrom the shell: \nsudo apt-get install gimp-plugin-registry\n\n\nFor Gimp >= 2.10 the plugin-registry and with it the resynthesizer and heal-selection plugins may not (yet) be available. Until we have access to these tools again we need to put the plugins\n\n\n*\n\n*resynthesizer\n\n*resynthesizer_gui\n\n*plugin-heal-selection.py\n\n\nto any of the defined plugin folders. I recommend ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins in our HOME. \nWe can get these either from compiling the source from the project's home page or from downloading an Ubuntu DEB file a release of the plugin-registry for GIMP 2.8 matching our architecture to extract above files. I tested these to still work on GIMP 2.10.6.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04 and later, with GIMP 2.10.18 (latest as of today), the Resynthesizer plugin is again included in the gimp-plugin-registry package. Install it with:\nsudo apt install gimp-plugin-registry\n\nHowever, probably due to the fact that Resynthesizer 2.x still relies on Python 2.x and this is no longer supported on Ubuntu, only the core plugin \"Resynthesizer\" is included and not the eight more specialized plugins like \"Heal Selection\", because these eight are implemented as Python scripts. Resynthesizer 3.0 for GIMP 3, once released, will use Python 3.x (source), and then we can expect its Python scripts to again come as part of this package.\nHow to cope without the Python-based plugins\nIn practice, only having the Resynthesizer core plugin available does not limit our options, it just complicates how to achieve what we want:\n\n[Filter >] Map > Resynthesize...\n[…] The hardest to understand, but the most powerful. […] But you must know specific steps to get one of the many effects. That's what the other plugins do automatically, they \"know\" the steps. The other plugins can all be replicated by specific steps using the control panel plugin.\n(source)\n\nFor example, here are the steps to remove an object with Resynthesizer:\n\n*\n\n*Open the image to work on. If possible, work on a cropped version of a very large image, as the plugin may otherwise crash.\n\n\n*In the image to work on, select the area to overwrite. All pixels in the selection will be replaced with best-fitting pixels given the surrounding texture, and there will be no seams at the edge of the selection.\n\n\n*Open another image to provide the input texture. This should be a copy of the image you work on.\n\n\n*In the texture input image, select all pixels that should be used to calculate the texture for replacing the pixels you don't want in the image you work on. Typically that would be the full picture except  the pixels you want replaced. Means, typically this and your other selection would not have any pixels in common, and together select the whole image.\n\n\n*Open \"Filter → Map → Resynthesizer\" from the image you work on. Select the texture input image in the form, and execute the Resynthesizer, leaving all other options at their default values.\n\nA: Here is a link: https://web.archive.org/web/20180225174428/http://registry.gimp.org/node/27986\nBasically you download the file and extract it, after that you copy it into your gimp plug-ins folder.\nFolder location: Go to your home folder, press Ctrl+h, search for .gimp2.x folder (x is  number of your gimp version) then search for plug-ins folder.\n\nA: For me this worked - flatpak install flathub org.gimp.GIMP.Plugin.Resynthesizer\n\nA: Got it worked by following,\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/377330/1384856\n(Gimp - 2.10.28)\nMake sure the folder plugins are copied to, is configured in Gimp.\nCheck: Edit > Preferences > Folders > Plug-ins\n", "Q: cod4 on wine problem I install cod4 on ubuntu 13.10 and everything is ok but when i connect to server cod4 just freez and send me an error iw3mp.exe has stoped working. any halp pls and thank you\nI google it and win users tell that is because one of this is problem - Uninstalled audio driver and let Windows reinstall driver.\n- Installed newest Realtek driver.\n- Changed file name in Mile.\n- Plugged in mic.\n- Enabled steriomix.\n and i realz dont know how to fix it.

This can be helpful and you can try to reverse those steps. \nLastly you can manually remove the related paths: \nDelete\n/boot/vmlinuz*KERNEL-VERSION* \n/boot/initrd*KERNEL-VERSION* \n/boot/System-map*KERNEL-VERSION* \n/boot/config-*KERNEL-VERSION* \n/lib/modules/*KERNEL-VERSION*/ \n\nand then \nsudo update-grub \n\n", "Q: failed to uninstall postgres-xc While trying to set up my rails environment to use postgresql I mistakenly installed postgres-xc. \nHowever an error occurred in installation, so when I tried to remove the package I get the following error:\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:  \n\n  postgres-xc   \n   0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.  \n1 not fully installed or removed.  \nAfter this operation, 17.2 MB disk space will be freed.  \nDo you want to continue [Y/n]? y  \n(Reading database ... 269015 files and directories currently installed.)  \nRemoving postgres-xc ...  \ndpkg (subprocess): unable to execute installed pre-removal script  (/var/lib/dpkg/info/postgres-xc.prerm): No such file or directory  \ndpkg: error processing postgres-xc (--remove):  \n subprocess installed pre-removal script returned error exit status 2  \n * Starting Postgres-XC datanode                                                                                                                                                   pg_ctl: another server might be running; trying to start server anyway  \npg_ctl: another server might be running; trying to start server anyway  \n                                                                                                                                                                            [ OK ]\n * Starting Postgres-XC coordinator                                                                                                                                                  pg_ctl: another server might be running; trying to start server anyway  \n                                                                                                                                                                          [ OK ]  \n * Starting Postgres-XC gtm                                                                                                                                                      gtm_ctl: another server might be running; trying to start server anyway  \ngtm_ctl: could not start server  \nExamine the log output.  \ninvoke-rc.d: initscript postgres-xc, action \"start\" failed.  \ndpkg: error while cleaning up:  \n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1  \nErrors were encountered while processing:  \n postgres-xc  \nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)  \n\nGoogling shows some solutions point to editing the /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgres-xc.prerm file to include exit 0 but that doesn't work. \nAlso, notice that its not even recognizing that file.\n\nA: Open the file using the command\nsudo nano /var/lib/dpkg/status\nthen remove the broken package postgres-xcand the whole block of information about it and save the file.\nthen do\napt-get install -f\napt-get update\n", "Q: mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting I have a problem I have been googling for at least 6 hours 28 hours with no luck.

AppArmor was the culprit, solution can be found here, citing:\nmount: cannot mount block device /some/path read-only\n\nand dmesg shows:\n[ 6944.194280] type=1400 audit(1385049795.420:32): apparmor=\"DENIED\" operation=\"mount\" info=\"failed type match\" error=-13 parent=6631 profile=\"lxc-container-default\" name=\"/some/other/path\" pid=6632 comm=\"mount\" srcname=\"/some/path\" flags=\"rw, bind\"\n\nAppArmor is blocking mount -o bind inside the LXC container.\nTo enable id add in /etc/apparmor.d/lxc/lxc-default:\nprofile lxc-container-default flags=(attach_disconnected,mediate_deleted) {\n  ...\n    mount options=(rw, bind),\n  ...\n\nReload apparmor:\n# /etc/init.d/apparmor reload\n\n\nA: First the rpc.statd error occurs because the daemon is not running. Start the daemon by:\nsudo service statd start\n\nSecondly, the mount option vers=3 is wrong it should be\nnfsvers=3\n\n\nA: If server is not mounting on localhost, the problem is not the network.\nTake a look at /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow.\nOnly for further problems...:\nI played this days with an old version of NFS. I had an intermediate switch between two hosts that allowed all TCP and UDP communications from ServerIP<->ClientIP, telnet worked on every port... but rpcinfo -p  didn't.\nWe've found that the switch had a feature called \"inspect\" that inspected all the \"sunrpc\" packets and if the version was not in the \"allowed\" versions, dropped the packets without logging anything. It's called \"Application Layer Protocol Inspection\". http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/fwsm/fwsm31/configuration/guide/fwsm_cfg/inspct_f.html#wp1349924\nAfter this we also found that we had to configure static ports for firewalling, but that's another issue.\n\nA: This neither seems to be the case but when mounting from a non-root user, the noresvport may be useful in /etc/exports.\nThis use to happen in Finder (MacOS X) when trying to mount a nfs unit.\n\nA: The issue can also happen to be as simple as the client machine's IP address has changed. (The machine you are getting the access denied error on.)\nOne can check the client's IP(s) with:\nhostname -I\n\nThen it's time to see whether this IP is among the ones authorized to access the share, revealed by:\nshowmount -e <REMOTE.NFS.SERVER.ADDRESS>\n\n", "Q: my ubuntu was so lame i want to ask why my ubuntu was working to slow for everything when i was inputing data and see my email inbox it was always loading , sometimes it was hangs , not responding \nwith requirement core2duo , ram 512mb and HDD 80GB \ndo you have any solution for this problem?\nthank you before\n\nA: I'm sorry but your computer is not powerful enough to run current Ubuntu well.

Now I want to setup an authenticated Git server on my own server.\nI've read some guides but they seem a bit complicated to me, specially when I have to deal with authentication. I'm looking for a simple and easy to setup/manage solution for that.\nFor example a web package that allows me to manage users and projects on a Git server. Is there any?\n\nA: You might want to try out GitLab.\nHowever, as far as I know, there has not been a packaged version for Ubuntu, so you'd have to carry out the installation manually, and installation may be a little intrusive (it may litter files that are not tracked by the package manager over your system). Once it's up, management is pretty much a breeze though.\nTo get around the \"intrusive\" issue, you might want to consider installing it in a VM or a Linux Container (LXC) that runs only GitLab (like an application server). \n\nA: Gitosis is good Git authentication/user management software. Ive used it professionally in the past and found it easy to use and maintain. It wouldnt be difficult to set up a web based UI to manage it, as something like Gitlab is to Gitolite.

Or is there a single OpenStack deployment per cluster?\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*What environment should I choose? - \"maas\"? - \"local\"?\nLocal is faster and more lightweight because you are not doing virtualization but using Linux Containers (LXC). I would try it first. I tried it and ran in to some problems where the LXC container was not allowed to build some kernel modules for Quantum/Neutron networking, but Quantum/Neutron networking is optional, so LXC may work for you.\nMaaS is designed to manage machines (usually physical, not virtual ones, but you can do virtual ones). Because of this, if you use MaaS, you will have to make a machine (possibly virtual) act as the MaaS server, and then network other machines (again, possibly virtual) to it. I've tried doing this before with KVM virtualized machines, and if you are doing it with very many things deployed, you need a lot of RAM.\n\n*If I choose \"maas\":\n\n\n*\n\n*while bootstrapping, I get ERROR 409 Conflict - why?\n409 Conflict is a general error that means there was some reason MaaS could not complete your request. There could be a lot of reasons this is happening, see the rest of my answers to see if anything starts to stick out as a possible cause.\n\n*I've setup the mass-cli login, using the profile \"maas\" as instructed. Do I need to add additional nodes?\nTo deploy anything with MaaS, you will need to add machines to the MaaS cluster (other than the MaaS server itself -- so you very well may have to create more virtual machines).\n\n*Can I add the node on which maas is already installed? - Do I execute juju commands from the machine being the original \"maas\" machine?\nYou get an API key from the account page in the MaaS web UI and put that in your .juju/environments.yaml juju configuration file along with the network address of the juju server. That allows whatever machine the juju client is running on to login to the MaaS server and send it commands. To get the key to use, go to the MaaS server web interface (http://ip_of_maas_server/MAAS/) click on the username in the upper right and then click on preferences on the menu that appears. That page will list a key to use.\n\n\n*I've tried using juju-gui in a \"local\" environment. I've followed the video from youtube on deploying openstack using juju, some of the components failed to install, their progress bars turned red - why?\nIt is hard to say for sure without more information -- the bar turning red means that some part of the code that set up the machine juju is using experienced an error for some reason. See Juju debug-hooks, how to run hook in debug terminal or get more information? for information on how you can get more information about the specific error.\n\n*Where can I find the list of juju commands to deploy a single all in one node?\nThe juju team has been working on bundles that let you deploy more that one service with a single command. I did see what looked like support for this in the WebGUI, in the form of an option to export and import a group of services. I don't know how ready this is (and you would need an export of a working configuration for openstack).\n\n\n*\n\n*When deploying from commandline, how can I verify the installation's progress/status? watch juju status seems a bit uninformative for first time user.\nRunning juju debug-log would be one way, but that can be (quite) verbose.\n\n\n*Considering the above picture : - Is there a single OpenStack deployment spanning across multiple clusters? Or is there a single OpenStack deployment per cluster?\nThat picture doesn't necessarily show anything directly having to do with openstack. It shows how you can configure MaaS. I will note that in a testing case, it is possible and quite likely to have one region controller and one cluster instead of one region with two clusters. A cluster is simply a group of servers (usually physical, but could be virtual) on the same switch that MaaS will manage and deploy juju services on. MaaS is not specific to Openstack -- you can deploy any Juju charm on top of it. So, you could have a cluster with a few machines managed by MaaS, and then use Juju to deploy wordpress and MySQL. MaaS would turn on two of the machines it manages at Juju's request, install Ubuntu on them, and then let Juju configure a webserver with Wordpress on one of the physical machines and a MySQL database server on the other. If you were to add another Unit to the MySQL service in Juju, Juju would have MaaS start yet another machine and it would install Ubuntu on that machine and then configure MySQL on that machine. In an openstack setup, Juju is just configuring the openstack software on the machines that MaaS manages. In a production, high availability setup, it would be prudent to create at least two MaaS clusters, and split up the units for each openstack service across those clusters so if you had trouble with one MaaS cluster the Openstack units in the other cluster would take over and the openstack system would continue to run without interruption. \n", "Q: \"make\" command is not doing any thing I am new to Ubuntu and I am trying to compile a small program.

These files are different for each kernel version, but are conveniently packaged for you in the repos. Try to install it this way:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nNote that your kernel version is being passed through the uname -r command.\n\nA: GCC gives the error because it cannot find the header file(s) you include. You should:\n\n\n*\n\n*check whether the path is not in the raw1394.c folder, because then you need to use quotes in stead of <>: so #include \"linux/module.h\" (this might be the case if you do not want to use your own kernel's header files)\n\n*Check your compiler path whether there is a file named linux with the header files in it. You're probably missing the Linux headers.\n\n\nSecondly, makefiles are used for automating the compilation process (since this often involves multiple instructions and/or different instructions for different targets). But you will still need the correct gcc command(s) in your makefile. So your (basic) makefile should look like this (a lot of extensions and flexibility can be added to it, read more about makefiles if you want to do this):\nCC=gcc\nCFLAGS=-Wall -c\n\nraw: raw1394.c\nTAB $(CC) $(CFLAGS) raw1394/raw1394.c\n\nall:\nclean:\nTAB rm -rf raw1394/*.o\n\nNote that specific intendations are used in Makefiles. Therefore I put TAB in the code where there should actually be a tab (multiple spaces will NOT work). \nTyping make raw in the correct directory on the command line will automatically execute target raw in the Makefile.\n", "Q: Why am I getting these undefined errors when I compile a C++ program in terminal?

To install all required packages of g++, do sudo apt-get install build-essential on a terminal and then to compile your program, do g++ -g main.cpp -o Main.\n\nA: You should use g++ for C++ programs always!\nThat's because:\n\n*\n\n*gcc is GNU C      Compiler\n\n\n*g++ is GNU C++ Compiler\nSo they are different compilers and so they are different packages. The main differences:\n\n*\n\n*gcc will compile: *.c / *.cpp files as C and C++ respectively.\n\n*g++ will compile: *.c / *.cpp files, but they will all be treated as C++ files.\n\n*if you use g++ to link the object files, it automatically links in the std C++ libraries (gcc does not do this).\n\n*gcc compiling C files has less predefined macros.\n\n*gcc compiling *.cpp and g++ compiling *.c / *.cpp files has a few extra macros.\n\nSource: What is the difference between g++ and gcc?\n\nA: I figured out the problem.

And you can compile and install it on any other Linux.\nYes, it's not built-in into Ubuntu and not so easy to install but this may be useful if you still want a small footprint web server but bb-httpd doesn't fit your needs.\nFor Ubuntu I created a PPA which contains the uhttpd.\n\nA: I also like to use PHP for this purpose, as it enables me to run stuff like WordPress on the fly and develop themes more easily (you still need MySQL, though):\nphp -S 0.0.0.0:8000\n\nIn the same script that starts this I also start guard, which auto-refreshes the browser on file change.\n\nA: You can use Nginx for that: https://gist.github.com/asterite3/89236d1753a669e173531aca4b87afdc\nThis is not single-threaded (server won't hang for other clients if accessed from, say, google-chrome) and is very configurable and effective.\n\nA: Use\npython2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 80\n\nor\npython3 -m http.server 80\n\nto start a simple HTTP server. \nReplace 80 with  another number if you want it to listen on a different port. For ports < 1024 it needs to run with root privileges.\n\nA: Since there's angularjs in your folder's name, it seems like it's an angular js app. In such case, be sure to check yeoman out.\nTo quote it's site\n\nYeoman 1.0 is more than just a tool. It's a workflow; a collection of tools and best practices working in harmony to make developing for the web even better.\n\nOne of many other things is the bundled grunt server.\n\nA: if you are more ruby minded, the serve gem is great\nserve\n\nor for i different port:\nserve 9000\n\ninstall with gem install serve\n\nA: This is also possible in Ruby without installing a gem.\nruby -run -e httpd . -p5000\n\nA: You want JS Lightning. It is just what the doctor ordered. It's a Node JS app.\nInstall it. Type \"js-lightning\" in any directory with servile files and it will serve on port 7000. Give it another port and you're good there instead. Lots of good features to make it useful.\nFor good measure, it will serve anything in the directory that it can \"require()\". Which is to say, it serves .js files in a manner inspired by PHP.\nhttp://jsLightning.com\n\nA: You can use ran a cross-platform language-agnostic, static http server\n", "Q: Kaspersky GUI for Ubuntu 13.04 Can You help me with this issue?It's possible to run Kaspersky on Ubuntu 13.04?\n\nA: According to Kaspersky they don't list that they have an anti virus program for Linux.

For this I'm using Virtual Boxes.\nActually, I am wondering if it possible to deploy Juju charms on MAAS nodes which does not have any kind of access to the Internet.\nFor this use case, I'm thinking of a local ubuntu mirror for MAAS nodes commisioning, and locally stored Juju charms for service deployment.\nIs it enough to have a fully disconnected MAAS cluster ?\n\nA: This could work in theory, but many of the charms will pull in stuff from the internet when configuring, like a BZR or Git repository or something like that.\nI would recommend allowing machines to be connected to the internet. If you are concerned about security, you can set up the network to do NAT or have a firewall so incoming requests can't get to the nodes, but outgoing requests can.\nIf you are concerned about bandwidth usage, I would set up squid or some other proxy in a transparent configuration between the virtualbox nodes and the internet.

The presets are probably for encoding with libx264, but since your ffmpeg configure is lacking --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 you do not have support for this encoder.\nThe libavcodec-extra-53 package will not affect your compiled ffmpeg, so it does nothing in this case.\n\nA: I am having the same issue. The answer is simple.\nLook at the version number of your libavcodec.

When you installed Ubuntu you replaced the bootloader.  when you uninstalled it, you removed that but didn't add the windows one back. as the previous 2 people have said, you either need to add grub back from a ubuntu(or other linux) live cd, or you need to fix the windows one using a windows recovery or install disk.

How do I safely delete all files with a specific extension (e.g. .bak) from current directory and all subfolders using one command-line? Simply, I'm afraid to use rm since I used it wrong once and now I need advice.\n\nA: If you want to delete all files of a certain type, but only 1 folder \"deep\" from the current folder:\nfind . -maxdepth 2 -name \"*.log\" -type f -delete\n\n-maxdepth 2 because the current directory \".\" counts as the first folder.\n\nA: find . -name \"*.bak\" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f\n\n\nA: First run the command shopt -s globstar. You can run that on the command line, and it'll have effect only in that shell window. You can put it in your .bashrc, and then all newly started shells will pick it up. The effect of that command is to make **/ match files in the current directory and its subdirectories recursively (by default, **/ means the same thing as */: only in the immediate subdirectories). Then:\nrm **/*.bak\n\n(or gvfs-trash **/*.bak or what have you).\n\nA: Quick Answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all files with the considered name or postfix recursively:\nfind . -name '*.pyc' -type f -delete\n\n*Delete all directories with the considered name recursively:\nfind ~ -path '*/__pycache__/*' -delete‍‍‍\nfind ~ -type d -name '__pycache__' -empty -delete‍‍‍\n\nSomewhat less tightly controlled, but in a single line:\nfind ~ -path '*/__pycache__*' -delete\n\n\n[NOTE]:\nd is directory option and f is file option.\n\nA: Deleting files is for me not something you should use rm for. Here is an alternative:\nsudo apt-get install gvfs     # install a tool that allows you to put stuff in the trash\nalias \"trash\"=\"gvfs-trash\"    # you can also put this in .bash_aliases or simply use the command without alias\ntrash *.bak                   # trash the files (thus moving them to the trash bin)\n\nAs Flimm states in the comments: \n\nThe package trash-cli does the same thing as gvfs-trash without the dependency on gvfs. \n\nSo:\nsudo apt-get install trash-cli\n\nYou don't need to make an alias for this, because the trash-cli package provides a command trash, which does what we want.\nAs Eliah Kagan makes clear in extensive comments, you can also make this recursive using find. In that case you can't use an alias, so the commands below assume you have installed trash-cli. I summarise Eliah's comments:\nThis command finds and displays all .bak files and symlinks anywhere in the current directory or its subdirectories or below. \nfind . -name '*.bak' -xtype f\n\nTo delete them, append an -exec with the trash command:\nfind . -name '*.bak' -xtype f -exec trash {} +\n\n-xtype f selects files and symlinks to files, but not folders. To delete .bak folders too, remove that part, and use -execdir, which avoids cannot trash non-existent errors for .bak files inside .bak directories:\nfind . -name '*.bak' -execdir trash {} +\n\n\nA: If in case you want to check the list before you delete the files, you can echo it.\nfind . -name \"*.bak\" -type f | xargs echo rm -rf\n\nThis will list out the search results that are piped to rm command via xargs.\nOnce you are sure about the list you can drop the echo in above command.\nfind . -name \"*.bak\" -type f | xargs rm -rf\n\n\nA: You don't even need to use rm in this case if you are afraid. Use find:\nfind . -name \"*.bak\" -type f -delete\n\nBut use it with precaution. Run first:\nfind . -name \"*.bak\" -type f\n\nto see exactly which files you will remove.\nAlso, make sure that -delete is the last argument in your command. If you put it before the -name *.bak argument, it will delete everything.\nSee man find and man rm for more info and see also this related question on SE:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove all .pyc files from a project?\n\nA: You can list all the files with that extension first before you use rm\nFor example,\nls *.bak\n\nIf you get only the files that you want to delete then you can use the rm\nrm *.bak\n\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu with Win8 with only 1 HDD and 1 partition I'm wondering if its possible to install Ubuntu alongside Win8 on a computer with only one hard drive (HDD, 750GB) which has only one partition (there are some additional small recovery partitions). It seems some people claim that one should not resize the partition on which Windows is located. Is that the case and if so won't I be able to dual boot?\n\nA: The only way is to resize the partition where windows is installed if you have no other. This is the most usual case and I don't see why those people claim that you shouldn't resize it (and tbh I never saw any claim of this type).\n(obs: but let the installer do it for you, do not do it before if you are not sure of how to do it. The installer does that easily and automatically)\n\nA: Thanks for the feedback guys! I've finally managed to install Ubuntu with some dificulty: Ubuntu didn't recognize that Win8 was installed (which seems to be a common problem with computers with UEFI - such as mine). It did however recognize all the partitions. Being afraid that the Ubuntu installer might mess up Windows, I used the Disk Management tool in Windows to shrink the partition. Then I ran the Ubuntu installer again and created 2 partitions from the free space, 1 swap partition equal in size as my amount of RAM and ext4 pratition from the rest of the free space. Then finally I had to change the boot settings so that Grub had 1st priority.

Many laptops use the Atheros adapters.\n\nA: I have the same problem on my Lenovo laptop.\nIt could be most likely a driver error.\nTry using sudo lshw | grep network to check your driver's name.\nThen use dmesg | grep <your_driver_name> and see if there are any error logs related to it.\nIf you find errors, go here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported and see if the driver ubuntu detected on is the one you need.\nIn my case it turned out that ubuntu forced some newer driver on my wifi card. If this is also your problem, then you'll need to change the module, but I'm still trying to figure that out.\n\nA: What fixed it for me was going to Edit Connections, choosing the particular connection, going to the IPV6 tab, and setting it to \"Ignore\".\nUbuntu has issues with their IPV6 on some systems.   Mine worked great for 5 years.  Then a after a routine update, it would drop consistently every 20 minutes.    Disabled the IPV6, and back in business.\n", "Q: Is my OpenVPN connection doing its job? My first question is whether or not my openvpn connection is working as it is supposed to (routing all network traffic via the tun0 interface).\nWhen I type netstat -rn I get the following:\n$ netstat -rn\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 wlan0\n10.8.0.1        10.8.0.17       255.255.255.255 UGH       0 0          0 tun0\n10.8.0.17       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH        0 0          0 tun0\n192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 wlan0\n\nDoes this mean that all data traffic is encrypted and routed via my OpenVPN server?\nFurther on: Could someone please explain to me what all this information means? What do different rows represent? What do all those flags mean? MSS? Window? irtt? etc...\n\nA: No, 0.0.0.0 (your default traffic) is going to 192.168.0.1 (wlan0)\nIf you want to route everything external to your vpn, you need to add a new default route and to delete the current one:\nsudo route del default\nsudo route add default gw 10.8.0.17 (where 10.8.0.17 is the vpn gateway)\n\nOpenvpn has the option redirect-gateway to do it the way you want (without using the routes above manually). \nSending everything over the vpn is not the default behavior of a vpn and usually not it's main purpose. A VPN is to connect two remote endpoints so it sends only what needs to reach the other endpoint through the vpn and not everything. (VPN traffic is encrypted so it is slower than regular connection).\n", "Q: Link to a script using 'dirname' I have a script placed in /opt/MyDir/myscript.sh which calls java, setting its directory as the classpath:\nscriptdir=`dirname $0`\njava -mx3g -cp \"$scriptdir/*\" MyApp.jar\n\nI have created a link to this script in /usr/local/bin/myscript but if I run it, the classpath is messed up.

I want to migrate the data/config to a bigger drive, but instead of using dd or Clonezilla (like a normal person), I started with a clean install on the new drive - I wanted to change the main admin username, install without home folder encryption (which I removed by hand from the old drive), and stop using LVM for a single-drive machine.\nSo here's where I'm at: I have Ubuntu Server installed on the new disk, and the main partition from the old disk is currently mounted at /mnt/old_drive, so I have access to all the files and things. I also have a dump list of all the packages I installed on the old machine.\nSo here's my question: how much of this stuff can I just copy over directly, reboot and have it work? Just /etc? I've got a couple things, like MySQL and PostgreSQL DBs, that I'm not sure if I can just copy over with cp.\nOr would I be better off installing each package and configuring/migrating them individually? I think the fact that I change the admin username on the new install may add a wrinkle (or not).\nEdit: I also do know I need to edit fstab rather than copying it over.\n\nA: If you are up for the learning experience, try backing up your current new /etc and then copying the files from /etc incrementally from the old drive to the new drive. As long as you arent changing versions of packages most software will gracefully handle that. There are however a few files that wont work, /etc/fstab being one prominent example. Also be careful with files in /etc/udev (as this will most likely contain hardware specifics, like MAC addresses of your networking hardware, etc)\nIf however you want to be on the safe side, just don't copy the files and manualy redo the changes.\nOf course you could also use a tool like kdiff3 or similar to compare the differences and visually migrate the settings.\nI personally would assume that the fact that you changed the admin username (I presume you mean user which you will be mainly using the computer with) might indeed cause some trouble, specifically with the SQL DBs as they tend to have the access rights stored somewhere within the DBs, however this could possibly be solved with an automated search and replace SQL statement. Additionally run grep -R with your old username over your old /etc directory and see if you get any hits other than the usual (passwd, shadow, groups) and improvise ;-)\n", "Q: How do I move window buttons from left to right using command line or by editing a specific file?

I have a laptop on which I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows\nNow just for learning purposes I am going to install Backtrack OS on it.\nMy laptop has 4 GB of RAM so according to the recommendation I have allocated 8 GB of swap space on my hard drive.\ncan I share the swap space between these two OS (Backtrack and Ubuntu)\nI really don't want to waste 8 GB of more space for swap (because as I have noticed it is rarely used and as far as I know OS doesn't store any data in swap space, does it?)\nSo is there a way with which I can share this 8 GB swap partition? If yes how?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible. The swap is only used while the system is running, so you can do what you want with the swap space when it isn't running, such as use it as swap space for another Linux installation. You can even share swap space between Linux and Windows, but it's a bit more work.\nThere is one exception: if you want to hibernate, then the swap space is in use while the system is hibernating.\nIf you point the installer at the existing swap space during the installation of the second distribution, it will be able to make use of it.\nWith today's disk sizes, there is usually no point in saving a couple of GB with such tricks. But it's possible.\nHowever, I question the utility in installing two Linux distributions in dual boot. Dual boot sucks — you can't run the two operating systems at the same time. If you want to run programs from two different Ubuntu releases, or more generally from two Linux distributions, I recommend a different approach: pick the one that has the most recent kernel and use it as your main operating system. Install the second one and run programs from it directly from your installed system, using schroot. I've written a guide on doing this which covers the installation of the second system using debootstrap and the schroot setup.\n\nA: Yes, you can share swap area with two or more operating systems. To share swap area, create the swap area when you install the first operating system and then when you install the second one, do not create a new swap area, instead just use the first OS's swap area as the mount point for swap area of the second OS.\nIf you have already installed both OS's, use gparted to create a common swap area and then add it to your /etc/fstab file to automount it at boot-time.\nJust in case you would like to know the drawbacks of using a shared swap area, refer this question on StackExchange:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ill-effects of sharing swap area\n", "Q: apt-get install automatically cancelled When I'm doing an update or installation on Ubuntu 13.10, the task is automatically cancelled in the terminal.

You can view in gparted which files-systems are supported for to resize there partitions. For example it is impossible to resize a xfs-filesystem.\nTo get to option of resizing, you need to click concerning partition in gparted only once, then right-click on this marked partition. There in popping-up menue is entry of \"resize\". But be really sure and look at least three times at : - which cylinder/byte-position is beginning of new partition - and - which cylinder/byte-position is end of new partition. Check if this is really correct for to avoid loss of datas or else \"doom\".\n", "Q: USB Audio Input recording 3.3x too slow, playback 3.3x too fast, and garbled I'm developing a USB audio device that acts like a microphone.  It produces an isochronous (USB-talk for real-time) audio stream at 8000 Hz, 16-bit PCM.  With Ubuntu 13.10 the recording takes place about 3.3x too slow.  That is, recording for 10 seconds produces a 3-second WAV file, that plays back much too fast.  (Best measurement of the ratio is 3.27.)  The playback is worse than speeded up, it's garbled too.  For example counting \"one.....two.....three\" sounds like \"bzt..bzt..bzzt\".  I tried 3 different audio programs (arecord, ocenaudio, Audacity) and two different computers.  Confoundedly, telling arecord to limit the recording to 10 seconds (--duration=10) actually takes about 33 seconds, and results in a 10-second WAV file.  It's as if the driver is in a time warp.\nRecording from the mic in a USB Logitech headset produces a good file, with the correct speed and understandable audio.  I know this sounds like a bad audio input USB device on my part, but recording from it works fine in Windows (via GoldWave).  My gut says there is a bug in the Ubuntu audio driver when the isochronous data is coming in at only 8000 Hz, which is unique.  Most microphones offer through the USB enumeration to sample for you at a variety of rates, e.g. 44100, 22050, 8000, etc.  For extraneous reasons I'm confined to 8000 Hz.  \nAnyone else see anything like a buggy audio USB driver?  Any ideas how to gain evidence incriminating or exonerating Ubuntu drivers?\n\nA: Turns out Linux needs uniform packets in USB audio input.  It matters how many sound samples are in each packet.  \nIn my application at 8000 Hz sampling, with the standard 1ms polling intervals of USB \"full speed\", that averages 8 samples per packet.  Due to a quirk I was sending my samples bunched up, 32 audio samples in one packet, then 0, 0, 0, 32, 0, 0, 0, 32, ....  Nothing wrong with that bandwidth-wise, there's plenty of room.  Windows processes fine, but Linux chokes.  \nWhen I sent the samples evenly:  8, 8, 8, 8, ... the audio got through fine.  I am guessing something at a low level in the USB audio drivers in Linux is making wrong assumptions.  But my workaround is clear.\n", "Q: Confusion with printf command? I have to print the following three lines in one print command without using echo command. So I have chosen printf command.Here are the three lines:\n  Different characters can be represented and supported \n  in the print command, for example: \n  x-y, X+Y, –, +, <, >, %, $, #, &.\n\nWhat I have done so far is:\n   printf \"\n   Different characters can be represented and supported \n   in the print command, for example: \n   x-y, X+Y, –, +, <, >, %, $, #, &.\n   \"\n\nBut I got bash error for the third line ','. \nSo will anyone enlighten me up.\n\nA: printf is a formatted print which takes a format string as its first parameter. The rest of the parameters are used in the format string. The three things to remember when using printf are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Although many languages have printf statements/commands/functions, they all differ a bit so always verify details in language specific documentation (C, bash, php, perl, etc.), \n\n*You should never use user supplied information in the format string. This is always a security flaw. If you want to display a user supplied string use a format string like \"%s\".\n\n*Both the backslash (\\) and the percent sign (%) are escape characters which change the meaning of the following character(s) if you want an escape character to appear in your output, it must be escaped or pulled in from another parameter. The dollar sign ($) is not special to printf, but is special to the shell, so be careful of your quotes.\nprintf is great for formatting numbers. look at the man pages for details\n\nA: As others have mentioned, the % symbol is special for printf.\nIf you just want to print out a string as it is, give to printf %s as a first argument, and the string surrounded in single quotes as the second argument:\nprintf %s '\nDifferent characters can be represented and supported \nin the printf command, for example: \nx-y, X+Y, –, +, <, >, %, $, #, &.\n'\n\nUsing single quotes instead of double quotes stops the shell from interpolating symbols like $.\n\nA: % is a special character in printf. That's what's causing the error. You need to escape it as %%.\n$ may also be substituted when within double quotes by the outer shell, so you should to escape that (\\$). It is usually just easier to use single quotes.\n\nA: Better to use:\nprintf \"Different characters can be represented and supported\\n\\\nin the print command, for example:\\n\\\nx-y, X+Y, –, +, <, >, %%, $, #, &.\\n\"\n\nYou get that error, as others have said here, because of % character which is special and must to be escaped.\nSee man 1 printf for more info.\n\nA: the % is special for printf: it is the leading char in format specifiers. If you want a literal percent, use %%\n\nA: It is a bit surprising to see that when you are not allowed to use the echo command that you chose to use the printf command instead.\nWhy not cat ?\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncat<<'EOF'\nDifferent characters can be represented and supported\nin the print command, for example:\nx-y, X+Y, –, +, <, >, %, $, #, &.\nEOF\n\n", "Q: Add packages to Ubuntu Distro installation I wanna create small change to Ubuntu Install CD.

I need to install same software on about 30 computer and I want to automate this process as possible.\nThanks\n\nA: I think it would be better if you make all the changes you want on one computer then make a system image of it and apply it to the other 29 computers.

It seems the server has been infected at some point even though the only open ports are pop3 and smtp. Can the server get infected using these ports?\nIf yes, what can be done to secure the server from further infections?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to get infected from any service that have vulnerabilities regardless of what port or what service it is.\nIn your case did Ubuntu 11.04 hit end of life (EOL) October 28, 2012. Unless you are having good routines for upgrading or, detecting and patching vulnerabilities would I strongly recommend to stick with Ubuntu LTS releases for servers in production environment. Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (long term support) would be a reasonable pick as it will be supported with security updates to April 2017.\nIt exist a lot of guides on How to secure Ubuntu servers, search the internet and try to filter what would be the best for your services.\nIf you decide to stick with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, would i suggest to have a look at the server guide. It also has a security part. Fail2ban might be of your interest. But maybe most important get the automated security upgrades rolling.\n", "Q: Remove Gnome from Ubuntu Gnome after switching to Cinnamon I installed Cinnamon on top of Gnome in Ubuntu Gnome 13.10.  I would like to remove the unnecessary parts of gnome, primarily the settings which show as duplicates with the cinnamon ones, making it hard to distinguish which is which.  I tried removing gnome-shell, but it caused the computer not to boot to the login screen.  Even If I must keep some parts installed, how can I remove the unnecessary components of gnome?\n\nA: As the Gnome Settings panel is the application gnome-control-center, you can remove it by running sudo apt-get purge gnome-control-center.

When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nunzip fp_10.3.183.43_archive.zip && cd fp_10.3.r183.43_archive/10_3_r183_43/\ntar -xvzf flashplayer_10_3r183_43_linux.tar.gz && cd flashplayer_10_3r183_43_linux\nsudo mkdir -p /opt/flashplugin-nonfree/v10.3.183.43\nsudo cp libflashplayer.so /opt/flashplugin-nonfree/v10.3.183.43/\n\nNow that you have the file for Flash player v10.3.183.43 in place, we use update-alternatives to install it as an alternative of a Flash player\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/flash-mozilla.so  flash-mozilla.so /opt/flashplugin-nonfree/v10.3.183.43/libflashplayer.so 10\n\nThen, just in case you have another version of Flash installed (for example, the broken one that gets installed with the flashplugin-nonfree package), run this:\nsudo update-alternatives --config flash-mozilla.so\n\nThis will prompt you to select a choice for the alternative flash-mozilla.so.\nJust select the one we just installed. Don't worry at all about the auto/manual stuff regarding alternatives, just ignore that.\n", "Q: How can I use ffmpeg to output a screenshot gallery / mosaic? I am wondering how to use ffmpeg to create video thumbnails something like this (taken from a VLC forum):\n\nI know totem can do this but totem does not support the video format that I am using\nThis article says that ffmpeg can do it.\n\nA: Create a mosaic of screenshots from a movie with ffmpeg\n\nIf you're using anything older than Ubuntu 15.04, then the so-called \"ffmpeg\" package from the repository refers to a fake version from the Libav fork which does not have the functionality you need, so you will have to download a static build of ffmpeg or follow a step-by-step guide to compile ffmpeg.\nExample command using select, scale, and tile filters:\n./ffmpeg -i input -vf \"select=gt(scene\\,0.4),scale=160:-1,tile\" -frames:v 1 \\\n-qscale:v 3 preview.jpg\n\nIn this example the output will be 960x450. You can add an additional scale filter if you want to change that, or you can change the size of each tile. Example for 600 pixel wide output:\n./ffmpeg -i input -vf \"select=gt(scene\\,0.4),scale=160:-1,tile,scale=600:-1\" \\\n-frames:v 1 -qscale:v 3 preview.jpg\n\nYou can even add text to the output. This example will add 24 pixels of black padding to the top of the image and add the text \"Iron Man\" in the center of the padding.\n./ffmpeg -i input -vf \"select=gt(scene\\,0.4), \\\n  scale=160:-1, \\\n  tile, \\\n  scale=600:-1, \\\n  pad=iw:ih+24, \\\n  drawtext=fontsize=30:box=1:fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/TTF/Vera.ttf:text='Iron Man':x=(w-text_w)/2:0\"\n  -frames:v 1 -qscale:v 3 preview.jpg\n\nOther stuff\n\n\n*\n\n*You can control output quality with -qscale:v. Effective range is a linear scale of 2-31; where 2 is best quality.\n\n*See the select filter documentation for more info.\n", "Q: setxkbmap resets in ubuntu 13.10 Changes using setxkbmap reset after a minute or two in Ubuntu 13.10. I've been using setxkbmap to modify my keyboard settings for years using Ubuntu, and after the upgrade to 13.10, the changes don't hold for longer than a few minutes.\nThis is NOT a duplicate. I'm asking specifically why changes made using setxkbmap are reset after a minute or two in Ubuntu 13.10. I'm not asking how to switch keys using other programs like xmodmap, xbindkeys, etc.\n\nA: Gnome\nGnome preserve xkb options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use dconf-editor → Follow path /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources\n\n*Put layouts needed in sources, example:\n[('xkb','us'),('xkb','ara')]\n\n\n*Add setxkbmap options to xkb-options, example:\n['grp:rshift_toggle', 'grp:rctrl_switch']\n\n\nUnity & Gnome\nxkb setting seems to be reset by Unity/Gnome settings daemon (periodically or when clicked to change layout) or when layout switch shortcuts used.\nThe above the method may not work.

It took me several days to finish the downloading. But, how to check whether the download has been completed, or it was just aborted halfway? I have this question, because for a mkv file, mplayer can still play it until the point it is broken.\nAny utility in ubuntu for such kind of checks?\n\nA: The matroska validation tool works great for checking the integrity of the container.  Here is a recursive wrapper script that I wrote in python that I use for large libraries. https://github.com/1010dvpt/mkv-validator \n\nA: As you do not have checksum info for the file (CRC32, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc), you could try to validate the Mastroska format itself.\n\nmkvalidator is a simple command line tool to verify Matroska and WebM files for spec conformance. It checks the various bogus or missing key elements against the EBML DocType version of the file and reports the errors/warnings in the command line.\n\nTo use:\nmkvalidator --details your-big-mkv-file.mkv\n\nHowever, mkvalidator could only validate the structure of the Mastroska container, not the \"payload\" (i.e. A/V data) in it. To validate the data portion, you still need a decoder to see if it decodes correctly. From https://superuser.com/a/100290 :\nffmpeg -v error -i file.avi -f null - 2>error.log\n\nThis command uses ffmpeg to read in the mkv file and tries to decode it frame by frame. Any errors found in the decoding process will be recorded in error.log file.\n\nA: There's the MKVToolNix, mentioned in the official Matroska website, which is a package of tools, one of them is mkinfo which can be used to retrieve some information about Matroska and WebM files.\nThere's also the mkvalidator as mentioned by the other answers, but I couldn't find recent builds for Linux.\nIf you check their download page, you will find Ubuntu deb repositories. And once you add the deb repository to your sources list, you will be able to install the command line tools and/or the GUI tool as well.\nHere is an example of the output you get when you use mkvinfo on a file:\n$ mkvinfo 1fbf4140-3807-49f7-9f78-91bdada71a6e \n+ EBML head\n|+ EBML version: 1\n|+ EBML read version: 1\n|+ Maximum EBML ID length: 4\n|+ Maximum EBML size length: 8\n|+ Document type: webm\n|+ Document type version: 4\n|+ Document type read version: 2\n+ Segment: size unknown\n|+ Segment information\n| + Timestamp scale: 1000000\n| + Multiplexing application: Chrome\n| + Writing application: Chrome\n|+ Tracks\n| + Track\n|  + Track number: 1 (track ID for mkvmerge & mkvextract: 0)\n|  + Track UID: 16615739537438539\n|  + Track type: audio\n|  + Codec ID: A_OPUS\n|  + Codec's private data: size 19\n|  + Audio track\n|   + Sampling frequency: 48000\n|   + Channels: 1\n|   + Bit depth: 32\n|+ Cluster\n\nMatroska page mentioning the tool: https://www.matroska.org/downloads/mkvtoolnix.html\nMKVToolNix page: https://mkvtoolnix.download/\n", "Q: Update Garmin Nüvi 255 maps Is there a way to update the GPS' (Garmin nüvi 255) maps with Ubuntu?\nI'm hoping for a free (as in doesn't cost anything...

I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 Server on a USB drive, which is the hard drive for this PC. How do I get the bootloader to load Ubuntu onto RAM? \nEssentially, this is going to resemble a live-cd type of environment, where the OS is on the CD/USB/HDD (whatever it may be), and gets loaded into RAM. \nHow do I do this with Ubuntu Server?\n\nA: Have a look at this from the Ubuntu wiki.\n\nA: You can't install the OS on RAM, because it is volatile memory. In other words. as soon as you power off your system, the RAM content is lost. You must install within non-volatile memory such as your HDD or your USB device.\nWhen you boot from non-volatile storage, a boot loader will load your OS from your storage and into RAM.\nHope this helps clarify!\n\nA: You have to instruct/set the BIOS to boot from the USB. At the system splash screen (on start up) press the key that is indicated to enter BIOS Setup (in my system it's F8). Once inside BIOS go to boot device priority and set the USB as first priority. Save and exit.\n", "Q: disable touchpad when using mouse I want to automatically disable my touchpad when I use a mouse.

I've also tried changing font colours, but it didn't do anything.\nHow do I get to see what I'm doing (or what I did do that screw it up)?\n\nA: For me the problem was a previous command that had crashed.

If you install the proprietary drivers (like fglrx-updates from the standard repository) and you install mplayer-vaapi you will have a splendid hardware acceleration on your movies. \nHere is an excellent how-to:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/install-mplayer-with-va-api-hardware.html \nAnd if you have trouble installing the proprietary drivers, you can find good info here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI\nEven my ultraslow Asus eee netbook can do 1080i now :-) thanks to \"vaapi\" (google for it)\n", "Q: Menu items greyed out I installed Gnome 3.10 on Ubuntu 13.10. Just to try it. Later I decided to remove it and go beck to Unity. It took me a while to remove Gnome. After that I experience some issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*in some apps global menu items are greyed out (all the menu item in Gimp, messaging indicator items, ...) I cannot click any of these items, but keyboard shortcut is working (for example - cannot click \"Save\" but CTRL+S works)\n\n*I have two network indicators in unity panel\n\n*in session menu there is a red circle in front of my username\nAny ideas...???\n\nA: I'm having the same problem, but I did not go through the installing/uninstalling GNOME 3.10. I think it just came with the regular ubuntu update. This unity-panel/global menu is such a headache, I don't know why the can't get it right.\nAnyway, this works for me for GIMP:\n* open a terminal and run: $ killall -HUP unity-panel-service\nThis will reset the menu and the greyed out items will then be available. However when you start GIMP again, it's back to the greyed out menus, thus you need to killall again.\nHope this helps\n-H\n\nA: I just actually upgraded to ubuntu 13.10 and got exactly the same problem. The appmenu is actually having a bug.\nSo to fix the problem (workaround) I actually disabled the app menu.\nRun your application evolution using :\nUBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 evolution\n\nThe menu will be inside the application and not in the appmenu. Items will not be greyed out anymore.\nHope this help.\n\nA: Even if the menu entries are grayed out, I can still access them through the Unity HUD (press ALT).\n\nA: This is a bug triggered with the addition of the libgtk-3-0 package from the Gnome-PPA.

I have a POP3 Windows Live/Hotmail account (@live.com). In Windows, with Outlook and perhaps other programs I don't know about, it is possible to receive emails as soon as they are received by the server. In Linux, I've only ever been able to receive emails whenever automatic mail checks happen.\nIs there any way to receive email in \"real time\" without using a web browser? Preferably, I would like to configure Kontact to achieve this, but suggestions to use other email clients that achieve the purpose are also valid answers.\n\nA: You are comparing apples with oranges. What you were doing (with @live account) is using a Web mail application to check your email that fetch mails from the mail servers directly. No POP/SMTP sane configuration will allow you this since it causes overhead due the TCP protocol, and it wastes resources on the server, etc. Also, there is really no need for real-time emails nowadays. Email will be there (in the server) for years to come until you fetch it.\nIf you abuse the SMTP/POP protocol you might be blocked or throttled delaying even more the mails to reach your client.\n\nA: As long as your don't have access to the configuration of the e-mail server you cannot recieve e-mails in \"real-time\".\nWhat you can do is periodically check for new e-mails, and set the period to a very short time. Via command line tool mail or with a common graphic e-mail client such as thunderbird or whatever.\n\nA: It's likely that whichever program you see receiving mail in \"real time\" is using something similar to IMAP's IDLE command (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP_IDLE). \n\"The IDLE feature allows IMAP e-mail users to immediately receive any mailbox changes without having to undertake any action such as clicking on a refresh button, or having the e-mail client automatically and repeatedly ask the server for new messages.\"\nWith this, the client establishes a connection and asks the server to notify of any incoming email, leaving the connection open at all times. When an email arrives, the server notifies and the client can take action instantly.\nThis feature is NOT supported by POP3.\nMy guess is that Outlook uses some proprietary protocol to communicate with Live (or whatever), which supports a similar feature. Outlook is most likely not using POP3 to connect with Live.\nSo to answer your question \"Is there any way to receive email in \"real time\" without using a web browser?\". The answer is \"YES\" given proper support of the required features on both client and server, and compatibility between them.\nLook at whether Live supports IMAP, then check whether your mail client supports IMAP IDLE, if so they may be able to work together and do what you want.\n", "Q: Built in mic distortion with ubuntu 13.10 I Have a serous problem considering my Built in mic in my Lenovo laptop ideapad S400,  i get distortion sound every time i use my mic either was for hangout, skype or recording my screen, its like my mic is always boosted and there is a heavy noise in the background.\nI could lower it a bit but i still get noise in the background, also my voice recording is very low.\nI tried couple of solutions such as adding these lines to this file->/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\noptions snd-hda-intel model=generic\noptions snd-usb-audio index=-2\noptions snd-hda-intel position_fix=3\n\nAlso tried to adjust my mic configuration via alsamixer via terminal.\nMy sound card is -> HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH.\n\nA: I upgraded the last package for my sound card and the problem some how solved, the distortion still there but i can raise up my mic to a level that the distortion is very low and does n't annoy the one i am calling.\n", "Q: Downloadhelper fails to Convert I'm trying to use the Firefox Add-On Downloadhelper to download and convert this 'video' of Einstein: http://sploid.gizmodo.com/listening-to-this-incredible-recording-of-einstein-will-1464557213 in order to have only its audio.

I'm sick and tired of Windows 8 and have decided to take the chance to change my operating system for the first time, ever. I'm worried about my files though; I have no way to backup my files onto an external hard drive, and I possess no disk capable of holding that magnitude of data. \nIf I download/install Ubuntu as a new operating system, will my computer's current files remain untouched? And is there any other worries I should be aware of before pursuing this change?\n\nA: In theory, you would back up your data and install Ubuntu. Installing any operating system is a major change to your computer and although not expected, there is no guarantee you will not have data loss.\nFor details see : Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\nA: Short answer: don't do that: yes, you can lose your data. Even if you don't install Ubuntu. \nLong(er) answer: you should backup your data (find a way. A bunch of cheap DVD+r discs --- double copy of each one). I do daily mirroring across two machine, weekly backup on an external disk, and bi-monthly backup on DVD. I used the backup at most a couple of way; it was well worth doing it. \nIn principle, Ubuntu could be installed alongside your operating system (if you have space on disk and if you can repartition it) without any data loss. But a lot of things can go astray (google is your friend for both cases), so I would never do anything so potentially disruptive without a good backup. And as I said, your disk could die even using only windows (or any other OS), or you can type the wrong command and wipe everything.  \nJust my 2c after 30+ years working on and with computers...\n", "Q: question about dual booting other linux distro with ubuntu 12.04 LTS My current setup:\nWindows 7\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS\nMy partition setup is this. (I used EasyBCD to resolve Grub)\nI followed this tutorial.

Both Drive C and Drive D. Wouldn't i have a problem with booting since i think win7 takes control of the MBR???\n\n*What's the best linx distro to work alongside ubuntu 12.04 with shared /home partition.\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: *\n\n*Can't really understand this question right. Use boot-repair to fix general GRUB problems.\n\n*From my experience, wiping the windows partitions never influences the other linux OS unless you execute stuff from them or you still have some sensitive data.\nWindows will take control of the boot EFI partition, in your case I think it's sda1, when you first install it. After that you can access the boot EFI and modify it to your needs (this is what the ubuntu installer did). \nSo, theoretically you can wipe sda2 and 3, but not sda1 because it will wipe the ubuntu boot data together with the rest. You can clean the old windows efi files from sda1 afterwards in ubuntu.\n\n*I think you could use pretty much any distro similar to ubuntu on the same home (forked ones for example, like Mint).\n\nA: As mentioned in the other answer, it's probably possible to share /home between two distros, but it's not recommended. This previous questions has some more information on this topic - A common /home partition for multiple Linux distributions\nYou can just delete the Windows partitions, grub should still work. If it doesn't, it's very easy to fix it with a live CD, see How to repair/restore/reinstall Grub2 with a Live CD for instructions on how to do this, but I do not think you will need to. \nAlso, a clarification. You didn't install Ubuntu on /boot, mostly you installed it on /, /boot just contains the Grub files. \nI would leave sda1 alone, but Drive C and D can most likely be deleted without any problem. \n", "Q: Can't make a 2nd SSH key login So a few months ago I setup key based login on my server so that it only accepts key based logins.

So my next question is can you scan a network that you aren't connected to.  Just for example like your neighbors wifi.  Is that possible to do using nmap?  If not what kind of program could be used to do this?\n\nA: No, nmap doesn't do this. nmap is an \"active\" scanner. It works by sending probes/signals to addresses on the network and analyzing the replies. When you can send signals and receive replies then you are, by definition, connected to that network. \nSome scanning methods are \"passive\" as opposed to \"active\". Passive scans are ones that don't involve transmitting any signals or probes, but listening only.

There may be third-party solutions for doing so (I have not searched for or needed any to make recommendations). Disk Utility will let you burn the .iso image to disc - drag the .iso file to the bottom of the Sources list in Disk Utility, select it, Control-click it and select \"Burn to disc\" from the contextual menu. The 12.04 release .iso will likely require burning to a DVD. After burning, the disc will be mountable.\n\nA: In my case, even after burning to a DVD using Disk Utility, it still would not mount, so instead I simply converted the iso to dmg:\nhdiutil convert ~/Download/ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso -format UDRW -o ~/Download/ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.dmg\n\nThen I used the dmg as the disk image file for DVD in my virtual machine.\n", "Q: How to hide my presence in the Friends app?

Is this another \"feature\" needs to disabled somewhere?\n\nA: Perhaps it not directly related to Ubuntu and it's kind of workaround but I hope it helps. Create group of friends let's say \"nochat\". In group \"nochat\" put fake account or some friend you'll never talk. Then go into advanced settings of chat and put that group of friends in field: \"Turn on chat for all friends except...\". In that way it wouldn't matter if you are online or not. When you want to use chat simpy delete that group from advanced settings. :)\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu on my desktop?

Ubuntu can run on almost everything including old Celeron processors (700MHz). If your system can run Windows or OSX then it can definitely handle Ubuntu much much more better.\nWhich version to choose is more a choice of your own. But I van help you narrow it down to two choices Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10.\n12.04 works fine and has the best support. It will still be updated until april 2017.\n13.10 is the newest version with more features but it has more bugs. It will be supported for less then a year.  \nHave fun!\n\nA: Ubuntu can run even on the most under-powered systems, you on the other hand, have a very capable one.\nI would suggest, judging that you are a beginner, installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, as it is a long term support version, it will most likely support all your hardware.\nThough, if you like to always have the latest and greatest, go with Ubuntu 13.10.\n", "Q: How to turn off a HDD at startup Last week I bought a thinkpad T430 with a 500GB HDD and added a 128GB SSD to it. Then I installed Ubuntu on the SSD and I'm using it, while there is a Windows8 pre-installed on the HDD and I never used and never will use it. I want to turn the HDD completely off, because when it is turned on, it decreases the battery life and also it makes some noises (standard spinning sound of HDD). I tried removing the related fstab entries, but it doesn't turned off even in the next boot.\nIs there any solution to turn off the HDD without opening the laptop and removing it physically?\n\nA: Try something like sudo hdparm -B 127 -Y /dev/sdb, assuming /dev/sdb is the HDD.\nIf that works, you can experiment with the /etc/hdparm.conf settings to enable aggressive power management on the HDD, put it to sleep/standby quickly, and turn the power off.\nThe file is well commented, and has a few examples. Also check out man hdparm for better understanding of the options.\nSomething like the following should quickly put the HDD to sleep:\n/dev/disk/by-id/...{\n    apm = 127\n    sleep\n}\n\nTo properly identify the HDD in /dev/disk/by-id/ look at the output of sudo hdparm /dev/sdb | head \n\nA: Check your /etc/fstab file for the line containing your windows partition(s) and comment those out so they no longer automount at startup, although they SHOULD still appear in the list of devices at the side in Nautilus but require a password to mount...\n", "Q: Can someone show me how to use command in Ubuntu?

I can open as many terminal tabs I want using Ctrl++Shift+T.\nBut for some reason, I'm not able to switch the tabs using Ctrl+PgUp and Ctrl+PgDown. So what is the shortcut-key to switch in between tabs?\nAlso, what do I do to close any particular tabs using the shortcut keys?\n\nA: You can switch the tabs using Ctrl+PgDn to next tabs and Ctrl+PgUp for the previous tabs.\nReordering can be done using Ctrl+Shift+PgDn and Ctrl+Shift+PgUp.\nAlso Alt+1 to Alt + 0 can be used to switch tabs starting from 1 to 10. Where Alt+1 is for 1st tab in terminal, Alt+2 is for 2nd tab ... Alt+0 is for 10th tab. \nIf more than 10 tabs are opened then you've to switch using the shortcut mentioned above. i,e Ctrl+PgDn and Ctrl+PgUp\nTo close any selected tabs use Ctrl+Shift+W\n\nA: gnome-terminal shortcuts can also be customized, which is very easy and useful, if you use different applications that ought to have set the same shortcut(s) [applies only to the current active application] for the same/similar function(s).\nExample: Closing tabs with Ctrl+w shortcut in gnome-terminal and geany (text-editor)\nIn \"gnome-terminal\" under \"Edit\" -▸ \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" (see screenshots below) you can set your custom shortcuts.  \nIf you use the same setup as shown below, and lets say you have three tabs open, you can simple switch between them with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+1 - Switch to Tab1\n\n*Alt+2 - Switch to Tab2\n\n*Alt+3 - Switch to Tab3\n\n*And also Alt+left-arrowkey or Alt+rigth-arrowkey - to switch from left to right through your tabs and vice versa! \nOnce you activated tab 1/2/3 you can then use Alt+w to close it.\n\n\n\nA: For me, what works is: Alt + shift + tab number.\n", "Q: Help installing Ubuntu Server I'm using an old computer to make a server, it has an Intel CPU and 2GB RAM.\nI made a bootable USB flash drive with Universal USB Installer, and even tried with UNetbootin.

Obviously there is different networking hardware installed. So what can I do now? Reinstalling Ubuntu with a stick would be easy, but not my favored way.\nTherefore my question is:\nHow can I \"remap\" the installed hardware for networking drivers and networking settings a it is done when booting from a stick or installing Ubuntu?\n\nA: The mapping of hardware to Ubuntu network device is in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules.\nThe trouble is that when you moved the disk to new hardware, new mappings were made for the network devices that don't match what is in /etc/network/interfaces. If you do ifconfig -a, you will probably see what is going on.\nRemove /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules and reboot. On boot it will be reconstructed, and you should have a set of devices that match the definitions in /etc/network/interfaces.\n", "Q: Auto switch workspaces I have several monitoring applications that we would like to project using a projector in the IT area of our office.\nOne of the apps is a Java application (so auto switching tabs in a browser will not work).\nIs there a way to auto switch between workspaces at a timed interval?\nOR\nIs there a way to switch between full screen apps on 1 workspace?\n\nA: This can be achieved using xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nUse a script something like this to send the workspace switching keyboard shortcuts, assuming Unity workspace layout:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwhile true\n    do xdotool key ctrl+alt+Right\n    sleep 5\n    xdotool key ctrl+alt+Down\n    sleep 5\n    xdotool key ctrl+alt+Left\n    sleep 5\n    xdotool key ctrl+alt+Up\n    sleep 5\ndone\n\n\nA: This can also be achieved using wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nScript for wmctrl:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwhile true\n    do wmctrl -s 0\n    sleep 5\n    wmctrl -s 1\n    sleep 5\n    wmctrl -s 2\n    sleep 5\n    wmctrl -s 3\n    sleep 5\ndone\n\nwmctrl is a more elegant solution; it sends messages to the window manager and can do other things like move windows to a specific workspace or raise them which may also be useful to you. However, the window manager is free to ignore these messages so it is perhaps not the most portable solution.\nwmctrl's -a option is the most suitable for your use: it will switch to the correct workspace and then raise the window.

Rather I bumped into the ln command which does pretty much the same (to my knowledge).\nSo if it's not the same, how do I create a shortcut?\nThanks!\n\nA: They're similar things, but while a link it's just that, a link to a file or folder, a shortcut can contain more information, like launching parameters, personalized icons, etc.\nTo create a symbolic link you just need to do in a terminal:\nln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symboliclink\n\nTo create shortcuts with personalized options, there's a program called arronax:\nsudo apt-get install arronax\n\nYou can create shortcuts, save where you want (usually the desktop or in $HOME/.local/share/applications if you want them to appear in the unity dash), set icons, set if you want to run the program in a terminal or not... etc.\nHere's an example:\n\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: The profile of gnome-terminal isnt correctly loaded by command line start I try to start a gnome-terminal by command line.The command line is \"gnome-terminal -e \"sh /home/vm/tmp/tmp.sh\" --title=\"tmp test\" --tab-with-profile=/home/vm/.bashrc --working-directory=/home/vm/tmp\".But,There is an error information that Java Environment isn't set.\nIf I start a gnome-terminal by /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop,there isn't that error information.\nSo,I think the profile of gnome-terminal isn't correctly loaded by command line start.\nWhat should I do?\nThe content of tmp.sh is \n#!bin/bash;cd /home/vm/tmp/kitchen;./menu\n\nModfied sh to bash dont resolve java Environment isnt set.\nAdded or deleted --tab-with-profile='Default', don't resolve java Environment isn't set.\nIf I start a gnome-terminal by /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop, running sh or bash /home/vm/tmp/tmp.sh is normal.\nI want to running result by command line as same as by /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop\n\nA: What exactly are you trying to do? \nAFAIK the --tab-with-profile is for choosing a predefined terminal profile (i.e. one of the sets of application configuration settings from ls ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/). This is used for setting things like terminal font and color preferences etc. - nothing to do with the shell profile or resource file.\nIf you want to execute a bash script why are you calling it with sh? Either just make /home/vm/tmp/tmp.sh executable with a #!/bin/bash shebang at the top, or execute it via bash not sh - that way, it should source your .bashrc file by default. \nIf you need to use a non-default bashrc file, you can set that with a --rcfile argument to the bash command itself e.g.\ngnome-terminal -e \"bash --rcfile alternatercfile /home/vm/tmp/tmp.sh\"\n\nA: --tab-with-profile should be used with the name of the profile, not some file path:\n\n--tab-with-profile=PROFILENAME\n                                Open a tab in the window with the given  profile.  More  than\n                   one of these options can be provided, to open several tabs .\n\nHence, you should be using the name of the profile in the Profiles window, in this case, I only have the default profile:\n\"gnome-terminal -e \"sh /home/vm/tmp/tmp.sh\" --title=\"tmp test\" --tab-with-profile='Default' --working-directory=/home/vm/tmp\"\n\ngnome-terminal automatically loads the .bashrc file without being asked (unless you are using another shell) so, there's no need to manually source it. You can also use the .profile.\n", "Q: No way to connect to my wifi - Dell m4800 - ubuntu 13.10x64bits I can't achieve to connect to my WiFi with a Dell Precision m4800 with Ubuntu 13.10 64 bits.\nI added the recommended \"Broadcom Corporation BCM4352 802.11ac Network adapter\" in Software & upgrades, which allows me to see the WiFi boxes around me.\nHowever, impossible to connect to them : the authentication always fails. \nMy lspci :\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor DRAM Controller (rev 06)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor PCI Express x16 Controller (rev 06)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)\n00:03.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor HD Audio Controller (rev 06)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI (rev 04)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)\n00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I217-LM (rev 04)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI #2 (rev 04)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #1 (rev d4)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #3 (rev d4)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #4 (rev d4)\n00:1c.4 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #5 (rev d4)\n00:1c.6 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #7 (rev d4)\n00:1c.7 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #8 (rev d4)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI #1 (rev 04)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation QM87 Express LPC Controller (rev 04)\n00:1f.2 RAID bus controller: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile SATA Controller [RAID mode] (rev 04)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 04)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107GLM [Quadro K1100M] (rev a1)\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4352 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 03)\n\nI would be very appreciative of any kind of assistance :)\n\nA: Since I got my M4800 I have been struggling with the exact same problem.\nWhile I hope the next driver will simply solve everything, I did actually find something that works - at least a bit.

Since of today the ssh user@server just hangs.\nA verbose output gives me \nOpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\ndebug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 19: Applying options for *\ndebug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0\ndebug1: Connecting to *** [***] port 22.\ndebug1: Connection established.\ndebug1: identity file ~/.ssh/id_rsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file ~/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1\ndebug1: identity file ~/.ssh/id_dsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file ~/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1\ndebug1: identity file ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1\n\nAnd then nothing happens....\nNothing changed in the configuration. I actually succesfully connected just the other day.\nI also pinged the server to be sure he was not down. And there I noticed I get a huge packet loss (order 70%)\nAny idea what is going wrong?\n\nA: The reason is not the SSH server/client connection but the connection itself. If you are seeing a huge packet loss you should check:\n\n\n*\n\n*The physical cables, routers, switches, etc. Change everything. If the packet loss is only when you ping the server, then check the server physical installation\n\n*Check the server workload, maybe is hanged. Restart the server if necessary.\n\n\nA: In case the connection issues aren't on your side and you need to get some work done, mosh (man page, home page) handles flaky connections way better than plain SSH can. Once installed on both machines, you can use it just like ssh.\n\nA: For me, while better than total hanging of ssh connections, mosh was not a usable solution in high-packet-loss situation. Not to mention that you need to have privileges to modify the server, firewalls, etc. to use it.\nSo I wrote ssh wrapper called ssh-line-mode (as it does what telnet(1) line mode did back in the days) - eg. which provides you with local line editor (so you can edit, recall history, etc. whole line and edit it without any lag locally, and it only gets sent to server via standard ssh once you press enter, where lag is much more tolerable).\nIt works wonders in both high packet-loss and high latency situations, but it isn't magic - if you are out of the shell and need full screen remote access (eg. ncurses application at remote side) you'll have to press a hotkey to disable line mode and use standard character-by-character ssh mode until you want to return to fast line mode.\n", "Q: How to make ubuntu look for available wifi networks?

Everything was working beautifully.\nHowever, after misreading some instructions on a related site, I uninstalled Wubi via Windows 7's Programs and Features control panel. I knew I was in trouble when the uninstaller displayed a message about removing a boot record; now my machine boots straight into Windows 7 with no option for using Ubuntu.\nI do know that Ubuntu is still there and will become usable again once I fix up my machine's boot options. However, after reading many similar pages on this and related sites I still have no idea how to do this. \nIf I have learned anything, it is that this process seems incredibly complex and frankly very confusing, not to mention risky in terms of buggering things up and bricking my machine.\nCan someone PLEASE post some simple (and foolproof) instructions on how to get Ubuntu booting again when I only have access to Windows? All I can tell you about my lost Ubuntu partition is that it was on /sdb-something-or-other (the second disk).\n\nA: I finally ended up with a regular Ubuntu installation instead of Wubi.\nThe problem may have been somehow related to my CD/DVD drive. I made a bootable USB medium and everything worked perfectly.

However, I have some issues with the boot configuration... According to the tutorial, the boot manager (ReFind) needs a kernel on the HD of Mac OS X to be able to find it, so I copied the kernel files from Ubuntu to MacOS X in /EFI/ubuntu and provided the information to the boot manager as described in the tutorial. \nHowever, in my case, ReFind can boot the kernel but it fails to boot at the end since it cannot find the folder /dev/disk/by-uuid and boots into the initramfs shell. Creating the folder manually and providing a syslink with the UUID as name, linking to the correct partition (in my case ../../sda4) lets me boot Ubuntu. \nOnly Problem is that I have to do those settings each time I reboot. As soon as Ubuntu is loaded, the /etc/disk/by-uuid folder exists as well as the /etc/fstab (which does not exist when booted into initramfs). But when I reboot I can only get to the initramfs shell again and have to create the folder and syslink again.\nSo not really sure what is happening there. Does anybody have idea?\nIt seems like the /dev/disk/ I get access to from the initramfs shell is not the one of the actual Ubuntu.

But never has changed. Here is the log generated by boot-repair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6426642/\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The suggestion to try this solution is a good one, and Dillmo's suggestion might work, too. I have three other suggestions, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*This problem can sometimes be caused by a failure to disable the Windows Fast Startup feature. Note that this is not the same as the \"fast boot\" feature in the firmware. If left enabled, Fast Startup can cause filesystem corruption and an inability to read files in shared filesystems, including in the ESP, where boot loaders are stored. Of course, if you can't boot Windows, you won't be able to disable this feature, which puts you in a conundrum. Either of the following two suggestions might help get you out of that conundrum, though....\n\n*You could try using my rEFInd boot manager. There are USB flash drive and CD-R images on its download page, so you can try it risk-free, without installing it to your hard disk. It's possible that rEFInd will be able to launch the Windows boot loader even when GRUB can't. You could then either switch to rEFInd by installing the Debian-package version or at least use its ability to boot Windows to disable Fast Startup. Note that rEFInd is likely to show two Windows options. Try them both.\n\n*Based on your error message, it looks like you're using the Windows Boot Manager (UEFI on /dev/sda2) GRUB option. Instead, try the Windows UEFI bkpbootmgfw.efi option; it might work better.\n\n\nA: This looks like bug #1091464.  Turn off secure boot in the bios system under the section boot, and you should be able to boot Windows.\n\nA: Your problem is probably a broken path to the Windows UEFI file. To fix this, follow these instructions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu.\n\n*Start up a Terminal emulator with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Run the command, sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot.

I'm trying out Ubuntu on some work PCs, but I'd like everything to be blocked on the users account, except Firefox and Flash Player.

I thought this might be related to some kind of snapping but I don't see any options for this in compiz-config. \ncould this be about unity's menu bar? Or anything else?\n\nA: I found your post when searching for a solution to the same problem, as I prefer my second monitor \"stacked\" over my laptop monitor. After fiddling around with it, I discovered that if you drag the window very quickly, it will work. If you drag it more casually, it will get stuck trying to snap/enlarge.\nI've decided I like this behavior because it allows me to snap/enlarge on my lower monitor quite effortlessly, but I can still drag to the other when needed. \n\nA: I had a similar problem, but what I found out was that the window got jammed by the other - smaller window because the window was not allowed to exit the edges of the smaller screen.\nmaking the window smaller, or bypassing the corner - allowed me to drag it to the other window.\nIt is counter-intuitive, since we're used to allow windows to go beyond the screen edges, and only the mouse is supposed to be confined by the edges.\nI think this behavior is a bug.\n", "Q: Cannot find drive after installing Ubuntu Installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my system.\nCreated a partition of 30GB for the OS and left the other 130 GB to store my data, pics and stuff.\nInstallation went fine , but now I cannot see my other drive ( 130 GB) \nI can see 130 GB free space on \"disk utility\", but it shows capacity of 30GB only\nI don’tknow how to access the 130GB partition to transfer my data form a external hard drive.\nNote: I have just Ubuntu installed on my system , no dual OS.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open gparted and note the name of the 130GB drive,it will be like(/dev/sdxx).\n\n*Run the below command to manually mount a partition or drive.\nsudo mount /dev/sdxx\n\nIn the above command replace xx with your 130GB partition's last letter and number.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you executed the above command,your drive will be mounted in /media.\n\n", "Q: Problem with apache 2.4.6 on ubuntu 13.10 no rewrite for wordpress links My rewrite was working well until i updated my apache and than went dead .\nMy 000-default.conf\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that\n    # the server uses to identify itself.

From an Ubuntu point of view that would be Wine with iTunes installed in it as shown here Run iTunes without virtualizing Windows?. Since iTunes will (re)create your database but software from other operating system are more than likely only able to use the device.\nAnother option would be to get a hold of a Mac, run iTunes and have it fixed and then go back to Ubuntu to store music. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 Compatible with an Asus U46e-bal6?

I want to make a file or folder undeletable, even the superuser can't be able to delete that file.Chattr command makes a file undeletable only if the files were in Linux filesystems (ext2,ext4). But I want to make a file undeletable which was present in ntfs filesystem.\n\nA: There is not such thing that \"root\" can't delete. Is like telling God that he cannot do or undo something. root can put your machine topsidedown and make 1+1=3 if it likes and you can't do anything to prevent it. So, you can't prevent root from deleting whatever file he likes, just can't. Nor NTFS, nor ext2/3/4, nor HSF+, nor FAT16/32/64 not any other filesystem ruled by the OS.\nThe long and boring answer\nUnless nobody else has root access to your system, this is impossible. But then there are ways that make users going a step beyond to delete the file, one of these is chattr:\n\nchattr changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.\n[...]\nA file with the i attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be  deleted or  renamed,  no  link  can  be created to this file and no data can be written to the file.  Only the superuser or a  process  possessing  the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.\n\nSo, if nobody has root access or capacity to boot using another operative system then the file is undeletable, otherwise any user can (and will) delete your file. The same if the filesystem is formatted and/or firmware techniques to remove data of the disks.\nHow to do it?\nCreate the file:\n$ touch deletemeifyoucan\n\nProtect it:\n$ sudo chattr +i deletemeifyoucan \n[sudo] password for braiam: \n\nTry to remove it\n$ rm deletemeifyoucan\nrm: remove write-protected regular empty file ‘deletemeifyoucan’? y\nrm: cannot remove ‘deletemeifyoucan’: Operation not permitted\n\nNow try with root:\n$ sudo rm deletemeifyoucan \nrm: cannot remove ‘deletemeifyoucan’: Operation not permitted\n\nUnprotect it:\n$ sudo chattr -i deletemeifyoucan \n\nIs gone:\n$ rm deletemeifyoucan \n$ #POOF!\n\n", "Q: Error using fluidsynth I installed fluidsynth following the instructions here:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/fluidsynth/wiki/Download\n...which were just sudo apt-get install fluidsynth\nBut get the following error when I try to run it and am unable to access it from python:\n$ fluidsynth\nFluidSynth version 1.1.5\nCopyright (C) 2000-2011 Peter Hanappe and others.\nDistributed under the LGPL license.\nSoundFont(R) is a registered trademark of E-mu Systems, Inc.\n\nCannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory\nCannot connect to server socket\njackdmp 1.9.8\nCopyright 2001-2005 Paul Davis and others.\nCopyright 2004-2011 Grame.\njackdmp comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; see the file COPYING for details\nCannot create thread 1 Operation not permitted\nCannot create thread 1 Operation not permitted\nCannot create thread 1 Operation not permitted\nJACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10\nCannot lock down 82246176 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)\ncontrol device hw:0\ncontrol device hw:0\naudio_reservation_init\nAcquire audio card Audio0\ncreating alsa driver ... hw:0|hw:0|1024|2|44100|0|0|nomon|swmeter|-|32bit\ncontrol device hw:0\nconfiguring for 44100Hz, period = 1024 frames (23.2 ms), buffer = 2 periods\nALSA: final selected sample format for capture: 32bit integer little-endian\nALSA: use 2 periods for capture\nALSA: final selected sample format for playback: 32bit integer little-endian\nALSA: use 2 periods for playback\nCannot use real-time scheduling (RR/10)(1: Operation not permitted)\nAcquireSelfRealTime error\nCannot lock down 82246176 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)\nCannot use real-time scheduling (RR/5)(1: Operation not permitted)\nJackClient::AcquireSelfRealTime error\nType 'help' for help topics.\n\n\nA: Real-time permission would allow Jack to configure itself for a higher scheduling priority, and to prevent its memory from swapping.\nHowever, Jack also runs without these settings.\nIf you want just simple playback, you should configure fluidsynth to use ALSA.\n", "Q: Unzip command is Archiving instead of Extracting I m trying to unzip \"Data.zip\" into the current directory using:\nunzip Data.zip\n\nBut i get a prompt:\nArchive: Data.zip\nreplace /home/jaggib/Data.zip?

I didn't want to deal with figuring out which files to put in which drive, so I Googled \"how to span disks\" and discovered lvm.  Fine, easy enough... so now I have one 6TB \"drive\" mounted as a ext4 filesystem at /mnt/bigdisk\nEverything seems fine, but as I'm now approaching 2TB usage, I started to wonder the following:\n1) How is the data being allocated?  Does each drive now have 1/3 of 2TB?  Or is one almost full?  How can I see it?\n2) What happens when one (or more) disk is getting near the limit and I add a file large enough that it has to cross disks?  An error, or does it just \"handle it\"?\nThanks.\n\nA: It depends on how you set it up.  The default is to fill one up and then the next, which is handled transparently.  When creating a logical volume with lvcreate, you can specify the --stripes nn flag to stripe the data across nn drives.  This allows faster access to data since it is simultaneously accessed on all drives in parallel.  You can see the current layout with lvdisplay -m and if you want to change it to striped, you can use lvconvert --stripes 3 vg/lv where vg and lv are the names of the volume group and logical volume.  This can take a long time if you allocated all of the space to the volume already.  Also for media storage, speed isn't really important and if you want the drives to be able to spin down to save power, then leaving it not striped may be better since only the drive that has the data you are accessing will need to wake up instead of all 3.\nAs for how to see how much space is used on each disk, there is not a good way of doing that.\n", "Q: PyDev not found in Eclipse Kepler Eclipse says it's correctly installed I suppose it's a similar problem as this question, but I was asked to file a separate question, because my problem is Python-3-related.\nSituation: Ubuntu 12.04 64bit, Python 3.2.3, installing Eclipse (Kepler) and PyDev.\nProblem: Cannot configure PyDev, cannot create Python project.

Is there anyway to fix this?\n\nA: According to Ubuntu bcm43xx documentation you should install firmware-b43-lpphy-installer package and use b43 module. So, first thing to do is to remove firmware-b43-installer and bcmwl-kernel-source packages. For this, give \nsudo apt-get remove --purge bcmwl-kernel-source firmware-b43-installer\ncommand. Then give \nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-lpphy-installer\ncommand. After installing the pacakges, load b43 module by \nsudo modprobe b43\ncommand and you wireless card should work. If it does not work after rebooting computer, try to find out whether b43 module is blacklisted or not by looking files in /etc/modprobe.d/ folder. You can try \ngrep b43 /etc/modprobe.d/*\ncommand.

I am trying to install \"Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit\" and I am having quite a hassle doing so. I downloaded the Iso file from the download page and then I used Unetbtin to convert my flash drive into a live drive.\nAfter booting up my computer from the flash drive it gave me the usual \n\n\n*\n\n*Default\n\n*Try ubuntu without installing\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n*Check Disk for errors\n\n*Check Memory \n\n\n^ That's from memory, it's not exactly what the list says.\nI noticed something odd though; these options were shown twice stacked upon each other. I haven't taken much thought to it and continued to the \"Install Ubuntu\".\nFrom there, I have many problems. I can't connect to a wifi, and whenever I try continuing installation it gives me errors with the option to \"quit, continue, retry\" and saying that if I continue it is possible that my installation could be ruined or broke if retrying doesn't work.\nAfter closing the installation it gives me an error of: \"WARNING: 0 bits of space are available check your memory and delete unnecessary files\". \nThis boggles me because I bought this computer originally with 600GB of memory. But after installing ubuntu 12.10 32 bit, it says I only have about 400GB which 200GB is shared by windows. But 0 bits of memory can not be right.\nSo I did a disk error check and it came out to saying 1 error was found. With that in mind I cleared the entire flash drive once more and tried creating the iso file on my flash drive again. \n-- Same double list, and same errors again.\nSo now I am very confused and have not the slightest ideas of how to fix this. What I do think is, is that the partition from the first installation hasn't be freed, and ubuntu 12.10 is still some where in the computer, just not active. \nThanks, any one who can help.\n\nA: I first guessed that it was the amount of partitions I had. So I looked at my partitions and one was unallocated - I extended my C drive using the space and then deleted another partition that wasn't being used. That became free-disk space but I was not able to easily extend the C drive with the remaining memory so I had to install a more advanced partitioning tool on Windows. After finally combining all unimportant and unused partitions, I rebooted the computer using my usb-drive that had the installation files. \nI went through the same installing process once more and again, errors. I finally decided that it must be the files that were corrupted so I completely wiped the files and reinstalled ubuntu 12.04 LIVE 64 bit.

Just a simple question, should I suspend or shut down my laptop for night (~8 hours), considering that I don't care about power consumption?\nIn Windows I would usually make it sleep because of how long it takes to boot, but since Ubuntu boots so quickly in comparison I can just shut down it if it's better for laptop.\n\nA: This seems to be a matter of taste.

The thing is that the 7.1 is a usb headset has some software for mic calibrations and sound quality which cannot be run under linux. My question is this, is there similar software in linux to calibrate the 7.1 headset or should I go for the analog Kraken Pro? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: From what I've seen, it's my understanding that the difference between 7.1 and stereo is made in your sound card, and that any stereo headset can be made into a virtual 7.1 headset by changing some sound options under All Settings > Sound > Output **\nchange the **Mode to Analog Surround 7.1 Output\nHowever, a USB headset is preferred as it comes with its own built-in sound card (especially if your computer's sound card doesn't support anything higher than stereo).\nI bought the 7.1 pro & haven't looked back. It's great.\nBottom line is, both the Kraken Pro and the Kraken 7.1 get their 7.1 audio from your sound card, and so both will have the same 7.1 audio. The Kraken 7.1 just gets more customization with the Razer software, and whatever differences there are in the specs. I don't think that Ubuntu has any of the fine-tuning that Razer's software has, but both headsets should have 7.1 surround once you set them to be that way.\nBefore you go off and buy one of these, take note that I'm not 100% sure that this is correct - this information is just from what I've seen whilst browsing for a new headset and personal experience with the audio options for my current pair of headphones. It'd be a good idea to go find some other sources, or wait for someone more knowledgeable to answer this question.\n\nA: I hope you understand the fact that you don't need 7.1 to experience full 3D surround sound. After all, we, humans have only two sound inputs (called ears) and there is no place to put more speakers around our head than that number.\nThe way human brain senses direction of the sound is more complex than disparity in sound levels between the ears. Human brain also process the phase difference between the sound sources. The sound coming from the left comes a little faster to the left ear, than to the right.

Can anyone tell me how to get windows/UEFI to run the 32 bit disk?  I have disabled secure boot and gotten a 64 bit disk to run, but I need 32.  If you are wondering why, I'm trying to fix something on my phone and the tools require 32 bit linux.  I also need to either use the live DVD or actually install it.  A USB or virtual machine won't work.\n\nA: First, why do you think you need a 32-bit Ubuntu? Today, there's seldom any real need for this type of setup, and it does complicate a dual-boot configuration with Windows 8 in EFI mode, so I strongly recommend against it unless it really is needed.\nIf you really do need a 32-bit Linux, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your firmware setup utility, disable Secure Boot.\n\n*In your firmware setup utility, enable CSM (aka \"legacy\") support. Ultimately, you'll want your firmware to switch easily between BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and EFI/UEFI mode, and most offer an \"automatic\" setting of some sort to enable this; but for now, forcing the system to BIOS/CSM/legacy-only mode will work as well, if not better. Unfortunately, different computers have different user interfaces, so I can't tell you exactly what this option is called. You'll have to hunt for it.\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu medium in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Sometimes, you'll see a choice of two boot options for the medium, one of which includes the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" in it and the other of which does not. Select the option that does not include the EFI/UEFI string to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n*Proceed with the Ubuntu installation normally.\n\n*If you set the computer to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode only, reset it to support both boot modes, if possible.\n\n\nOnce Ubuntu is installed, you'll need to find a way to dual-boot. Broadly speaking, there are three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can rely on your firmware's built-in boot manager to switch between EFI-mode (Windows) or BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode (Linux) boots. This is usually a bit awkward, but some people find it acceptable. Unfortunately, some EFIs have such poor user interfaces that this option is literally unavailable.\n\n*You can use rEFInd as your boot manager. Install it in Windows and edit the refind.conf file: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the options. When you reboot, you should see an option for Windows and a gray diamond-shaped icon that should boot to the GRUB that your 32-bit Ubuntu installer installed. Unfortunately, the EFI features that rEFInd uses to boot a BIOS-mode boot loader aren't available on all computers, so this option might not work for you; but if it does, it can be a convenient way to proceed.\n\n*You can install a 64-bit (yes, 64, not 32) EFI boot loader for Linux and configure it to boot your 32-bit kernel. I know this is possible with some EFI boot loaders, but not with all of them. (The EFI stub loader can't do it, for instance.) I'm sure that at least one of GRUB 2, Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy, and ELILO can do this job, but I can't promise that any specific one of them can do it.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few EFIs that are so inflexible that a BIOS/EFI dual-boot is impossible. If you've got one of them, your only hope is to use a 64-bit EFI boot loader for Linux.\nGiven all the caveats and the pretzel-twisting that's required to get this to work, I think you can see why I recommended sticking with a 64-bit version of Linux.\n\nA: Yes,you can install 32 bit ubuntu os alongwith 64 bit windows 8 operating system,but your system was a 64 bit machine.For this you actually need a bootable dvd or usb with Ubuntu 32 bit os loaded.To make a bootable ubuntu usb in windows use unetbootin software.\n", "Q: How to stop Ubuntu from talking to me? The title may sound silly, but on Ubuntu 13.10, I'm getting frequent audible notifications using text to speech.\nIs this the \"speech dispatcher\" and how can I disable it?\n\nA: I had the same problem maybe, starting with Ubuntu 15.04. The Screen reader is off, same with the dispatcher setting; but it keeps telling me what I'm typing.\nI have running four dispatcher, all at the time that can't be killed because they're starting again directly. To solve my problem, I went to System Settings -> Sound. On Applications, I muted the four speech-dispatcher.\n\nA: Do you want to change the systemwide settings for Speech Dispatcher? The (yes/no) systemwide settings for Speech Dispatcher can be changed by editing the /etc/default/speech-dispatcher file. \nOpen the terminal and from the terminal open the /etc/default/speech-dispatcher file for editing in nano text editor:  \nsudo nano '/etc/default/speech-dispatcher'  \n\nFind the lines in speech-dispatcher that say:\n# Set to yes to start system wide Speech Dispatcher\nRUN=yes\n\n...and change RUN=yes to RUN=no.\nThis will disable the system wide speech dispatcher audible notifications, if they have been previously enabled. Press the keyboard combination Ctrl+O and after that press Enter to save the speech-dispatcher file. Press the keyboard combination Ctrl+X to exit nano.\nYou can still toggle enable/disable the screen reader after it has been turned off systemwide by using the keyboard shortcut Alt+Super+S\n\nA: Pressing AltSuperS will disable or enable speech dispatcher.  \nThe last thing you should hear is \"screen reader off\" :-\nps. The Super key is the \"windows\" key...\n\nA: Go to the Settings application. Select Universal Access. You will see a tab labeled \"Seeing\". In there should be Screen Reader. Turn that off.\n\nA: Maybe \"orca\" has bean launched. Kill the \"orca\" (Screen Reader) process, then you should hear \"screen reader off\".\n\nA: Go to universal access under settings then turn off the screen reader\n\nA: I was also facing same problem with Laptop\nMy solution was simple\nSystem -> Sound -> Application and  then I muted all four Speech-dispatcher\nand it solves my issue.\n\nA: You can disable it in following ways :-\nPress Alt + Super + S \nor goto System Settings > Universal Access > Turn Off Screen Reader\nIf you will check your System Setting > Sound > Applications then may be you can find that some instance of Speech Dispatcher is running.

I want to use Thunderbird as my email client but I want to store all the emails to Windows Drive as my Ubuntu Partition has low space. Is there a way I can configure it to store all of the profile and messages to anyother location?\n\nA: I have not done that, but i did move my profile from Windows to Ubuntu before and it worked. But you need to be sure to use the same thunderbird version for both setups or weird things can start happening (and please backup before starting).\nI will assume here that you have already installed Thunderbird on your Windows partition and on Ubuntu GNU/Linux, and that you have ran Windows version at least once (so that it sets up all the needed files). I also assume that your windows partition gets mounted somewhere when you run Ubuntu.\nSo you will first need to determine where the profile got saved in Windows, that changes depending on the versions and how you've set up. You are looking for something like AppData or Applications Data or something like that. Find the folder Thunderbird where you should have profiles.ini file. If you found it, you are on the right track. Open it in notepad, you will see something like\n[Profile0]\nName=default\nIsRelative=1\nPath=your path\n\nSometimes path can be Profiles/adfsdfsfd or something like that (i.e. a subfolder of the current one). Take a note of two things: where you have found the profiles.ini file and the path to the default profile.\nNow we go to the Ubuntu GNU/Linux and the fun begins.\nInside your home directory go to .thunderbird (note the dot), if the directory doesn't exist, i would run thunderbird once, create a profile without setting anything up, we'll delete it in a second. In that directory you will find the profiles.ini file.\nAt this point there are two paths you can take:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can create a symbolic link to the profile\n\n*You can point Thunderbird directly to the Windows partition\n\n\nLet's start with the first. In the terminal, from within .thunderbird directory type:\nln -s /path/to/windows/profile/directory/profile myprofile\n\nThen type\nls myprofile\n\nand you should see some files being displayed. If you don't, you've mistyped something\nThen edit profiles.ini with the editor of your choice, changing the Path to 'myprofile' without quotes.\nIf you want to point directly you need to change two things in profiles.ini\nIsRelative=0\nPath=/path/to/profile/directory/profile\n\nStart your Thunderbird and check that you are seeing the setup as you had it on Windows. Once everything is ok, go to .thunderbird directory and delete the initially created empty profile (or you can skip that if you don't mind wasting a couple of MiB of disk space).\n", "Q: What Happens When I Upgrade Ubuntu? I just need some advice on upgrading from 12.10 to 13.04.\nWhat happens when I upgrade? Do my files, settings, and internet bookmarks stay intact? I can't find any resources to help me with this.\n\nA: Upgrade means: it will update the core software to new features and better functionality and by doing this update you will never lose any of your personal data, files or installed applications.\nUpgrade simply means shifting your home from a Single bed room flat to a Double bed room flat. All your stuff will be there and there is room for some other more but its risky too for arrangement in the new flat.\nSo There is a chance that you upgrade can fail and it will take the stability of your system or it may be dont want to boot after upgrade , WiFi , VGA drivers , etc many issues are there .\nIf I were you , What I do ?\n\n\n*\n\n*before going to move to the upgrade take all your important data as backup.\n\n*If you more time and high speed Internet , download the ISO of which you would like to get as upgrade and make sure that the hardware and everything running properly in a normal way.\n\n\nhope that helps.\n\nA: \nI just need some advice on upgrading from 12.04 to 13.04.\n\nYou can't upgrade from 12.04 to 13.04. You need to 12.04 -> 12.10 -> 13.04. But 13.04 support stops in January 2014 so you better upgrade until 13.10 which has support until April.\n\nWhat happens when I upgrade? Do my files, settings, and internet bookmarks stay intact?\n\nYour system files get upgraded. Anything that it's not /home could be subject of upgrade. Personal files, personal settings, internets bookmarks, etc. Anything under /home don't get touched, but a backup is always advisable.\nJust a piece of advice\nSince you will be downloading 1.5 years worth of upgrades, the easier solution is reinstalling Ubuntu 13.10 or waiting until April when 14.04 LTS gets releases. Many successive upgrades tend to break things around and also your bandwidth will suffer.\n\nA: Still it is advised to clean install the new Ubuntu. If you have a /home directory then in my recommendation you should format old Ubuntu and install new one. If you don't have /home then it's alright to upgrade in the formal way.

So I went ahead and proceeded to install and swap in the empty space I created earlier (separately, I meant) and the boot loader in sda (like I've done so many times in non-UEFI machines).\nBut after the installation was completed, I was unable to get grub working, it just booted directly into Ubuntu with no grub and then I followed the Magic boot repair path and ended up with a black screen and a grub> prompt. \nI searched everywhere and all I found was boot-repair.

(Note, however, that if you created a separate /boot partition, you'll need to press F2 or Insert twice and add ro root=/dev/{whatever} to the boot options, where /dev/{whatever} is your root device. This should not be necessary if you did not split off /boot into its own partition.) If that works, you can install the Debian version in Ubuntu, which should cause rEFInd to take over as the default boot manager. (If you've got a separate /boot partition, installing the Debian package will obviate the need to add boot options.)\nThe more complex solution is to dig in and do GRUB debugging. There are numerous sites that describe how to do this. One that I wrote is this developerWorks article, but doing a Web search will turn up lots more. This process is complex and requires a lot of knowledge to do right, which is why Boot Repair exists -- it's supposed to do the tricky stuff for you. Unfortunately, as you say Boot Repair did not work, digging in manually may be your only option.

New \"Downloads\" folder should have an arrow icon on it (just as default one)\n3. The folder should show up in Places\nWhat I did:\n1. Deleted existing \"Downloads\" folder from Home\n2. Made a link to \"/media/vorpall/27DCD6C93788CE6E/Media/Downloads\"\n3. Pasted it to Home\n4. Opened user-dirs.dirs, changed string XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/\" to XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\" and saved the file. Now \"Downloads\" folder has an arrow icon.\n5. Rebooted my laptop. Now \"Download\" link at Home is broken. There's a lock icon on it.\n6. Then I went to \"/media/vorpall/27DCD6C93788CE6E/\" and the link got healed! It is not broken any more, although it is now an ordinary folder without arrow and it is not on Places. That is because user-dirs.dirs got updated for some reason and now XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads string is again XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/\"\nI think that happens because Ubuntu probably checks Home folder for broken links and only THEN loads other drives.\nIs there a way to make Ubuntu load drive with \"/media/vorpall/27DCD6C93788CE6E/Media/Downloads\" before checking for broken links? Or there's a simpler way to solve the issue? There must be!\nPlease help me guys. I am a second day Ubunty user.\n\nA: Hey I guess your drive is not mounted at startup, therefore the link dous not work till you mount the drive (by opening it). I don't have experience how to do it, but I think this question gives a answer. \n\nA: The problem is that your '/media' drives do not get mounted until you actually visit them in a file manager of your choice. What you should do is to add that particular drive in your /etc/fstab, then it will get mounted when your computer boots up. I would suggest mounting it outside of /media directory to avoid confusion.\nIf the drive is formatted with FAT you can add the line like this:\n/dev/sda7       /shared     vfat         umask=000                                           0 0\n\nHere i assume that the drive is at /dev/sda7 and that you have created /shared.\n", "Q: Cannot install graphics tablet ; CD Drive broken and Driver not found online Okay, so I purchased a Medion USB Graphics Pad\n(P82019 MD86935).

I want to install Ubuntu on my HDD without erasing what I have on it. I have checked some videos but they show it on 1 hard disk and some people say to delete the partitions on the HDD to make partitions for Ubuntu.\nBasically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I install Ubuntu on my second HDD without deleting what is on it\n\n*Will I still be given a choice to dual boot\n\n\nA: If your 1 TB drive only has a 200 GB partition on it, skip the rest of this paragraph. If it has one big partition on the entire drive (w/200 GB data on it) it would be best to shrink that partition first using Window's own Disk Management tool. If you cannot shrink it enough, cancel, defrag it to move files down on it, then shrink it. You may need to reboot Windows for it to check the partition shrinkage, that all went well.\nThat should not lose any files on that drive, but it is best to back up what you definitely do not want to lose, in case you make a mistake or get interrupted (power failure, etc.)\nThen you can install Ubuntu on the unallocated part of the 1 TB drive. Make sure that you know which drive is which. While you are booted from Ubuntu live/install you may want to run bootinfo script and look at RESULTS.txt to make sure you know which drive is which and that the Windows mbr is on the SSD. I will assume for the remainder that the SSD is your primary drive (/dev/sda) with Windows mbr, and 1 TB drive is /dev/sdb.\nNot sure if automatic partitioning methods allow you to select where to pub grub, but I personally would select Other at the partitioning part of install, partition like I want it, and put grub on /dev/sdb (assuming 1 TB). Afterwards before rebooting, switch your BIOS to boot the 1 TB drive. From grub there you should be able to select whether to boot Linux or Windows.\nI do something similar with the drives reversed, where I left Win7 and its mbr on my 1 TB drive /dev/sda, but boot using grub in the mbr of my SSD /dev/sdb (which contains Ubuntu).\n", "Q: Packages for web development Could somebody tell me what packages do I need to download to have an Apache server on my PC and to be able to use Php, JQuery, javaScript and mysql?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: For apache2, mysql, php you can install the lamp stack by doing\nsudo apt-get install tasksel\ntasksel\n\nand choose to install LAMP server. This will create a working webserver with mysql and php pre-configured. You need to create your own database and tables to be used on the webserver in mysql though so installing MySQL Workbench might be useful too.\nJavascript does not need packages since it is part of your browser. \njQuery is a javascript tool set. You download it and put the scripts in a directory inside your webserver. Something like /var/www/{project/}js/. You then include the jQuery files in your html.\nIt might also be useful to install a code editor.

The only diffrence between the two situations is that on a normal boot the dots on the splash animation change and on resuming are just static white.\nHow can I remove the unneeded \"Resuming...\" message on a normal boot?\n\nA: You can't.

This functionality exists, and works, on Dropbox and Google+ so I do have a copy of the videos.

If you don't supply that password it won't work, sudo or no sudo.\nmysqldump can look at your .my.cnf file to get the password, and it'll get that from the user runing the mysqldump command. So, if the Linux root user has a .my.cnf configured with a password in it, then yes, sudo will help. However, if the mysql root user has a password and it's not configured in any .my.cnf's then sudo won't help.\nYou could add the mysql root user and password to your own user's .my.cnf and then you don't need sudo either, but that's a security risk.\nAs the other answers point out as well, you might need sudo to write the output somewhere that root (Linux, not mysql) owns.\nLastly, you don't tell us which user is executing the script, if it's in root's crontab (for example), then sudo will not be necessary, although you may still need a .my.cnf to provide the password.\nIf your mysql root user has no password set, then the only issue is writing the output, in which case sudo is required if you don't run the script as root.\nIf you run the script as root (for example, as a script in /etc/cron.daily) then you should not use sudo within the script, irrespective of all the above\ncredit\n\nA: This did work for me:  \nmysqldump -u {db_user} -p --databases {db_name} > /home/$USER/my.dump.sql\n\n\nA: mysqldump on a production server does not work with sudo. Please try this:\n$ sudo su\n# mysqldump database> database.sql\n\n\nA: Add write permissions of the folder you want to dump the sql file in:\nsudo chmod 755 folder_url\nand run:\nmysqldump -u user -p db_name > db_dump.sql \n\nA: Make sure you command destination path mentioned.\nFor eg: sudo mysql -u YourUsername -p DatabaseName > ~/Path/Where/you/Want/The/Dump/FiletoBe/Kept/dumpfile.sql\n\nA: mysqldump requires username of the current user else it will take root as default. When you do aisi su, you automatically provide root access. Try this with your username in place of user. mysqldump -u user -p Enter password when prompt.\n\nA: Dump to your home directory was the better answer here for me. If, for example, you can't sudo and you get permission denied, it's actually denying you permission to write the dump to your current directory. Specifying your home directory will solve it.\nmysqldump -u me -p --databases my_db > $HOME/mysqldump.sql\n\n", "Q: Passwordless ssh cannot accept the key I'd like to connect 4 hosts with paswordless SSH.

Since I bought it, it has been a pain in the ass to get Ubuntu working beside Windows. I finally made it but this week I decided it was time for a new install and after several install tries I ended up wiping my whole HDD through Gparted on a friends computer.\nI started from scratch and now I have windows 8 installed properly and ubuntu installed on its own partition, but only windows boots, I was going to try a boot repair, but the pc won't boot from the ubuntu USB it throws an error: \"Missing Operating System\".\nIf its any good information, I have a 1tb HDD the first partition is Windows, the second Ubuntu, I don't know if this has something to do with the partition table being GPT, I was thinking wiping the HDD again with a Live CD and making a new partition table and then a installing windows and ubuntu.\nAny help will be appreciated.\nEDIT\nThe usb live disk was corrupt, I did it several times and turn out the usb was corrupt or something.\nI had to do boot-repair and on the second time, the problem was fixed.\n\nA: You're probably running into issues related to selecting the boot mode -- BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI. This can usually be controlled to some degree via firmware settings and/or via the firmware's built-in boot manager. Each can usually be accessed by pressing some function key (or Esc or Del) early in the boot process, but which you get (the firmware setup utility or the boot manager) depends on which key you press. Unfortunately, it's impossible to be more precise than this because these details vary between computers. (FWIW, though, my ASUS motherboard enters the firmware setup utility via Del and the boot manager via F8.)\nIn theory, if you prepared the Ubuntu USB drive via a dd command from the .iso image file, it should boot in either BIOS/CSM/legacy mode or in EFI/UEFI mode. In practice, though, if you used another utility (like unetbootin), all bets are off; these tools often render the resulting image unbootable in one mode or another (usually EFI/UEFI mode).\nBecause you're dual-booting with Windows and using GPT, it's safe to say that Windows is booting in EFI/UEFI mode. It's impossible to say about Ubuntu, though; unfortunately, Ubuntu's installer is still brain-dead when it comes to detecting mis-matched boot modes, and it will happily install in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode on a computer that has a copy of Windows that's booting in EFI/UEFI mode. This can lead to problems, including exactly the one you describe, this may be what's happened to you; however, there are other possible explanations. For instance, you might have buggy firmware that refuses to boot anything but the Windows boot loader, or you might have Secure Boot enabled and no Secure Boot support for Ubuntu. (Ubuntu theoretically supports Secure Boot, but this support sometimes fails to work.)\nThus, I recommend you do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot.\n\n*Prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager and try to boot from it.\n\n*If rEFInd boots, and if it can launch both Windows and Linux, try installing rEFInd's Debian package in Ubuntu. This should take over as the default boot manager. If this works, quit; you're done. (Unless you detest rEFInd. In that case, learn about all the available EFI boot loaders and install whichever one sounds good to you.)\n\n*If you boot straight to Windows when you reboot after installing rEFInd, then chances are you've got a buggy firmware. Reboot to Linux using the rEFInd USB/CD-R. You can then either:\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo mvrefind.sh /boot/efi/EFI/refind /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot. This implements a hack that renames rEFInd so that it looks like the Windows boot loader. The firmware should then run rEFInd.\n\n*Run Boot Repair, but be sure to use the Advanced settings tools and select the box to back up the Windows boot loader and put GRUB in its place. (I don't recall the exact wording of this option.) This will do something similar to mvrefind.sh, but with GRUB rather than rEFInd.\n\n\n*If all of this fails, post the URL that Boot Repair generates. It will give us more detailed information about your computer, which is necessary to give a more specific answer to your question.\n\n\nOne more point: You may want to read my Web page on EFI/UEFI Linux installation. It will give you a better understanding of how these things work, which may be helpful in solving your current problem and avoiding similar problems in the future.\n", "Q: Is there a way to search for keyboard layouts by characters on specific buttons?

I tried this guide \nto install ffmpeg, but now I want to remove it completely from Ubuntu 13.10, but when I did that guide to remove, ffmpeg is still there!\nHow to remove it exactly?\nafter removing ffmpeg I see this output again:\ndeniz@deniz-Ubuntu:~/Downloads$ ffmpeg\nffmpeg version git-2013-11-15-995f450 Copyright (c) 2000-2013 the FFmpeg developers\n  built on Nov 15 2013 18:32:56 with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.8.1-10ubuntu8)\n  configuration: --disable-yasm\n  libavutil      52. 53.100 / 52. 53.100\n  libavcodec     55. 43.100 / 55. 43.100\n  libavformat    55. 21.100 / 55. 21.100\n  libavdevice    55.  5.100 / 55.  5.100\n  libavfilter     3. 91.100 /  3. 91.100\n  libswscale      2.  5.101 /  2.  5.101\n  libswresample   0. 17.104 /  0. 17.104\nHyper fast Audio and Video encoder\nusage: ffmpeg [options] [[infile options] -i infile]... {[outfile options]     outfile}...\n\nUse -h to get full help or, even better, run 'man ffmpeg'\n\n\nA: How to Compile FFmpeg in Ubuntu tells you how to undo everything in the Reverting Changes Made by This Guide section:\nrm -rf ~/ffmpeg_build ~/ffmpeg_sources ~/bin/{ffmpeg,ffprobe,ffserver,vsyasm,x264,yasm,ytasm}\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove autoconf automake build-essential git libass-dev \\\nlibgpac-dev libmp3lame-dev libopus-dev libsdl1.2-dev libtheora-dev \\\nlibtool libva-dev libvdpau-dev libvorbis-dev libvpx-dev libx11-dev \\\nlibxext-dev libxfixes-dev texi2html zlib1g-dev\n\nhash -r\n\nHowever, seeing your other recent ffmpeg question it appears that you did not follow the guide or did not follow it correctly so this may not work for you.\nThe guide does not install ffmpeg to the system. This is to avoid conflicts with packages from the repository, but I'm guessing you did install to the system with sudo make install without using checkinstall; therefore it is not integrated in the package management system. If this is the case then try:\ncd ~/ffmpeg\nsudo make uninstall\nhash -r\n\nThe guide is supposed to make compiling easy since the ideas is that the user must only successfully copy and paste, but compiling is not for everyone and results may vary.\n\nA: Execute this command:\nsudo dpkg -l | grep ffmpeg\n\nIf this command returns any output then it means that you've installed it and doesn't removed completely. Now you can remove all ffmpeg using following command:\nsudo apt-get autoremove $(dpkg -l | grep ffmpeg | awk '{print $2}' | tr '\\n' ' ')\nsudo apt-get --purge remove $(dpkg -l | grep ffmpeg | awk '{print $2}' | tr '\\n' ' ')\n\nEdit\nman ffmpeg opening manual doesn't mean that it was there. It was because some of the configuration files remained in system when you un-install the program. You can delete them but it is not recommended. I'm posting the command to search all the files in your system matching with ffmpeg and delete them all. But remember it is not recommended to do so..\nsudo find / | grep -w ffmpeg | sudo xargs rm -r -f\n\nIt should remove all the ffmpeg files and also you'll not be able to open the manual again.\n", "Q: Wireless card driver installation I have problem installing drivers for Asus wl-138g v2 card.\nFirst, after installing Ubuntu 12.04, I did everything that I could find with jockey-text or its GUI version.

I use VMWarePlayer and Ubuntu, but it seams that it´s not using my real (phisical) grafik-cart, wath can i do? Is there an VM that can use the hardware or is there a easy way to intall Linux?\n\nA: Most virtual machine softwares emulate hardware with the exception of the cpu. Some such as Vmware Player allow you to connect usb devices. You can install VMware Tools to get some graphics support for gaming within a VM, but it won't be stellar, so use low resolutions, and put the VM on the fastest storage device you have.\nAlternatively Parrallels Workstation Extreme is a VM program that allows the connection of pci-e devices to a vm, including graphics cards, however you will then need 2 physical cards. 1 for the host, and 1 for the vm. It's also extremely expensive.\nIf you have a non UEFI version of windows such as XP or Windows 7 you can use an outdated version of Ubuntu with WUBI to install Ubuntu into a file on your windows partition. The ubuntu install will boot as a native Operating system, but no paritioning is needed, and you can uninstall/install it from inside windows.\n", "Q: Only Guest session can be started While Ubuntu is starting, the following messages are shown and stays shown for long time:\n* Starting LightDM Display Manager                                      [OK]\n* Stopping Send an event to indicate plymouth is up                    [OK]\n* Starting startpar bridge for notification of upstart job start/stop   [OK]\n* Stopping startpar bridge for notification of upstart job start/stop   [OK]\n\nAfter reaching the login page and attempting to login, the same messages are shown again, then I'm returned to the login page to choose between my my username and a Guest session.

There exists a well-known bug in gnome-power-manager, which breaks Ubuntu on computers with 2 or more batteries. If one is empty, Ubuntu will shutdown ('critical battery'). As a workaround, it can useful to disable shutdown on critical battery status. However with Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy, the GUI doesn't allow this. What can I do?\n\nA: Please install dconf-editor (sudo apt-get install dconf-editor) and go to\norg gnome settings-daemon plugins power\nClick the shutdown that is highlighted and choose \"nothing\" from the options as seen in this screenshot:\n\nPlease do be careful. If the 2nd battery runs out of juice be sure to shutdown yourself. \n\nA: Shutdown the system and dismount the empty battery. BTW, that bug was fixed 9 years ago.

In the sense that applications and programs are clickable on the desktop?  I can't seem to figure anything out and cinnamon isn't working for me on 13.10\n\nA: If you drag an application icon from the Unity dash, to the background, it should create an icon there which you could double-click on to launch the app.\nIf it doesn't work, there's a bug in either Unity, Nautilus, or both, that broke it perhaps. Granted it's not a common action, so may have slipped through the cracks. You should file a bug about it not working. For a workaround, you can copy the .desktop file for the application you want to see there, from /usr/share/applications/ into ~/Desktop/, and run chmod +x application.desktop or right-click on the file, and choose Properties, switch to the Permissions tab, and toggle the [] Allow executing file as program option in there.

The only problem is, my computer never loads the grub 2 boot manager, it goes straight to the windows boot manager.  I've tried reinstalling ubuntu and also running boot repair from the live cd, but nothing has fixed the issue.  My bios apparently is booting uefi, if that could be causing the issue.  Also, I am not getting a option to boot grub in the bios.  The only two options I have are \"Windows boot Manager\" and my cd/dvd drive.  I thought I might be able to get it to boot ubuntu if I added a custom boot option.  I tried the filepath: \"dev/sda\" because that it where the Boot info script from boot repair said grub2 was installed --then again, I am probably doing this wrong.  I also tried setting a filepath to \"dev/sda4\" because where ubuntu is intalled.  Both of these options make my comp boot straight to the bios when I have windows boot manager disabled. \nHere is the pastebin from boot repair:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/6432676/ \nCan anybody help?\nISSUE RESOLVED:\nA combination of these ideas below worked. When I disabled UEFI, it didn't boot ubuntu, but it booted the CD into the text based menu, which allowed me to boot from the hard drive, which allowed me to boot into ubuntu installed on my hdd. From there I was able to do a boot repair, converting to a uefi boot. Then I reinabled UEFI in the settings and added a boot option with the path: sda2/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi. And boom! the Bootloader actually loaded directly from the hdd. \n\nA: As your question says your ubuntu is installed properly but it is not showing GRUB menu at the booting time..\nDon't worry.. This is just the matter of some changes in BIOS settings.\nGo to your BIOS menu and then go to BOOT options(The names and order may change depending on your BIOS)\nFind for the option secure boot(if it is there) and Disable it (If it shows some warning then just accept it)\nNow in boot menu check for the entry which shows UEFI or Legacy..You should select the Legacy option..now save the changes and restart your PC now you should get GRUB\n", "Q: ASUS N56VZ not charging on 13.10 I'm new to running Ubuntu (or Linux for that matter) as a desktop OS, I do however have experience on the server side of Linux.\nI've installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my ASUS N56VZ-S4215H.

Suggestions on this website recommend setting the time parameter for Ubuntu to manual. I did that. In fact, I changed both the Microsoft Windows setting and the Ubuntu setting to manual. However, the time conflict still shows. \nWhy is Ubuntu picking up the system time setting as GMT + 0.00 and what can I do to change this bizarre error? \n\nA: Something to do with Windows using local time en Linux UTC. You can fix Linux to use local time or Windows to use UTC:\nTo fix Windows, just hit Start and type regedit.exe in the search box. Hit Enter and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation. Right click anywhere in the right pane and hit New > DWORD (32-bit) Value.

It can be installed only adding a PPA, running apt-get update and then apt-get install some-package-from-ppa.\nCan a control file from a deb package contain a PPA address and install that package when the deb file is installed?\n\nA: \nCan a control file from a deb package contain a PPA address and install that package when the deb file is installed?\n\nNo. You can only control the name of the package and the version via control file. Why you could do is creating a package that adds a file under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ with the repository, but it implies a two steps process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the package with the repository, update package list.\n\n*Install your package.\n\n\nInforming your users before hand that they should add first the PPA you need removes the need of having to install the first package and updating the list to just installing your packages. Through adding a third party repository that you don't control (and the user possibly doesn't trust) could cause a security concern, since the third party repository isn't obligated to only serve only the packages you need but whatever packages the owner decides, i.e. adding a rouge version of openssl that replaces Ubuntu's. That's why is recommendable to try hard and only set as dependency packages that either are in Ubuntu's repositories or provide those packages yourself.\n\nA: (Answering Sandro Meirer)\n\nThe current answer is almost 7 years old. Has there been a change? Is this possible in 2021?\n\nI'm sure it is still possible to do this in 2021.

The only commands I am entering into the terminal are things like 'sudo apt-get update' or 'sudo apt-get install build-essential bison flex libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libqt4-dev libqscintilla2-dev'.\nThe installs and updates haven't quite been working as I want(I don't know the causes yet), I just want to know if I can experiment, exit terminal and reinstall things that I have already tried to install without causing problems to the system. \nFor now I just want to have peace of mind in my trouble shooting, before I need to ask more specific questions about issues.\nMuch appreciated!\n\nA: To some extent. The update/upgrade process and the installing of software, if stopped in the middle, can throw some errors at you but those are solvable. \nExample of an error you can see is this one: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/) is another process using it? with this as an answer.\nYou can also see this as part of the experience. If you break it you can always re-install since you most likely do not have any important personal files it will not be harmful. Or otherwise put those files on a pendrive.\nBut as a general rule I would advice to always let commands run their course. \n\nA: apt-get is fairly robust, and will in most cases survive being interrupted, but It may leave the rest of the system unstable until you either finish the install or roll it back. Other commands have different, well, everything and your mileage will vary. i.e. vim is robust enough to save almost all of your work in progress, but interrupting compiles may introduce subtle errors, which make will try to compensate for. \n", "Q: How can I migrate from Elementary OS to Ubuntu 13.10? I’ve been using Elementary OS for a while now, but I want to try GNOME Shell 3.10, and from what I’ve read Ubuntu 13.10 is required. Since Elementary OS is based on Ubuntu 12.10, I won’t be able to try GNOME Shell 3.10 in Elementary OS. So, how can I migrate to Ubuntu 13.10 without loosing my data?\n\nA: If you installed your /home in a separated partition, just select \"Something else...\" in the Ubuntu installation, then select the /home partition, and mark it as do not format. Select your / partition and use it as /. Then continue the installation.\nDo backups as well.\nIn any other case, do backups and reinstall bottom-up\n", "Q: XFCE Full Window Tile I'm using XFCE 4.10 (Xubuntu 13.10), when I drag any window to the top of the screen, it gets tiled to half desktop, like this:\n\nAlso when I drag the window to the left or right, it doesn't stick vertically.\nHow can I have it maximize windows when tiling them on the top or bottom of the screen?\n\nA: \"How can I solve it?\" If I take your meaning sir, you are displeased by two default Window Manager settings. One can be found in Settings Manager -> Window Manager Tweaks -> Accessibility -> Automatically tile windows when moving toward the screen edge. For the other, perhaps you are thinking of Settings Manager -> Window Manager -> Advanced -> Wrap workspaces when dragging a window off the screen.\n\nA: I think the answer is in the (question in the) following link:\nxubuntu 12.10 window tiling shortcuts\n\"To align a window to left/right/top/bottom half of a screen with mouse you should go to 'settings editor' -> 'xfwm4' and uncheck 'wrap_windows' property.

Is it possible to set a different idle time not shown in this list, say, 15 minutes?\n(Frankly, it's silly to present only a few options like this.... Why not permit an arbitrary number of minutes?)\n\nA: Please install dconf-editor (sudo apt-get install dconf-editor) and go to\norg gnome settings-daemon plugins power\nClick number besides idle-brightness and it will allow you to change it.\n\nSpeculation on my part: the lack of options in the GUI is to not make it too crowded and \"experienced\" users that need more refinement will probably know about dconf. \n\nA: For those scared of GUI's:\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power/idle-brightness somenumber\n\nThe maximum value is an arbitrary number. The numbers are counted in minues. So\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power/idle-brightness 300\n\nIs the equivalent to 5 hours.\n", "Q: How I can know that a Ubuntu ISO was created using a Live CD customization tool? How I can know that a Ubuntu ISO was created using a Live CD customization tool, e.g. remastersys? Or how I can know that a Ubuntu ISO was created or generated? \nDo Live CD customization tools leave things in generated ISO?\n\nA: I'd suggest checking the SHA256 sum for the .iso you have vs the official ones. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download the SHA256SUMS file from the respective release page here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/\n\n*Ensure that the iso you want to verify matches the file name of the iso you believe it could be from (one of the filenames in SHA256SUMS).\n\n*Ensure that the downloaded SHA256SUMS file and the iso are in the same folder.\n\n*Execute these commands in a terminal:\ncd <PATH TO THE FOLDER>\nsha256sum -c ./SHA256SUMS | grep OK\n\n\n*If it prints the file name then OK, it is an official iso otherwise it has been changed.\n\n\nA: Unless you know what they changed to the installer you will not know. It is totally possible to create an installer with alterations you never ever going to notice.\nIf you want to be sure that you download an official unaltered version of Ubuntu you need to get the file from the official source. The would be from this location or this location (where the last one will change the last part of the URL when we change release).\n\nIf you want to know more about creating an ISO or want to know how to do it to understand it start here How to customize the Ubuntu Live CD?

Cause I've got a local device for which I can't Block upnp and that device is using the multicast ip range and the multicast dns can be accessed cause of the problem mentioned above.\nSure I could just block it in the router but I wonder if its possible to just disable it, os wise.\nAs I googled I found something concerning the stopping of the multicast dns service, instructions were as follows:\n# chkconfig --level3 avahi-daemon off\n# service avahi-daemon stop\n\nDon't know how to check if its disabled now tho. so I would appreciate it if someone could tell me how to turn off these 2 services?\n\nA: Try with this\nnano /etc/init/avahi-daemon.conf\n\nSearch for the following lines, edit the line with “start on” and add “never and”:\nReplace the line \nstart on (filesystem and started dbus)\n\nwith\nstart on (never and filesystem and started dbus)\nstop on stopping dbus\n\n", "Q: Problems with unzipping .tar.gz For installations i've needed to unzip .tar.gz so ive used\n  tar fvxz  file_name.tar.gz\nyet it replies with\ntar (child): file_name.tar.gz: Cannot open: No such file or directory\ntar (child): Error is not recoverable: exiting now\ntar: Child returned status 2\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n\nwhat should i do?\n\nA: This is a normal error message stating the file does NOT exist.

I want it to go to the Analogue output (my PC) like it used to on 13.04. I can change it using the pulse-audio Volume Control program, but my settings are lost after I reboot.\nThe pulse-audio Volume Control doesn't have my Analogue Output as a valid option in the Output Devices tab; it appears only after I select Analogue Stereo within the Configuration tab. I then choose it as my \"fallback\" device (which I think means default device?), but my changes are not saved between reboots.\nAfter changing the output device to Analogue Stereo using the Configuration tab, I then have to change the output of the individual program using the Playback tab, since it uses the current default (HDMI).\nI've tried setting my default audio device using pacmd, but it hasn't helped: my Analogue device does show up as the active sink when I run pacmd list-sinks, but it's not the selected device within the Volume Control (in the Configuration tab) so I don't get any sound unless I manually change it.\nDoes anyone know how I can preserve my sound settings between reboots?\n===== EDIT =====\nHere's the output of some pactl commands after I start my PC; the Analog Stereo source is missing:\n$ pactl list sources short\n0   alsa_input.usb-046d_08b2-01-U0x46d0x8b2.analog-mono module-alsa-card.c  s16le 1ch 44100Hz   SUSPENDED\n1   alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.hdmi-stereo.monitor    module-alsa-card.c  s16le 2ch 44100Hz   SUSPENDED\n\n$ pactl list sinks short\n0   alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.hdmi-stereo    module-alsa-card.c  s16le 2ch 44100Hz   SUSPENDED\n\nI then open the pulse-audio Volume Control and select the \"Analog Stereo\" item from the Configuration tab.

But when I reboot my PC the settings are lost, and I can't find a way to restore them from command line.\nThanks.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I'm not an expert but this is what worked for me. \nFor what I've understood the problem is that pulse is loading by default the hdmi profile of the sound card. That means that even if you set the default sink as alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo when pulse try to use that sink it can't find it. \nThe solution I've found is to manually configure pulse to make it load the desired profile when it starts. To achieve this you have to edit /etc/pulse/default.pa and at the end of the file add this three lines\nset-card-profile alsa_card.pci-0000_00_1b.0 output:analog-stereo\nset-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\nset-default-source alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor\nthe first line set the desired card profile. In my case was output:analog-stereo, you can have a complete list of profile running :\npactl list cards \nthe second and third line sets the default output and input respectively.\nAnother thing you can do is add a configuration for alsa to use pulse. Look in your home directory for the .asoundrc file, if the file does not exists create it and write this inside:\npcm.pulse {\n     type pulse\n}\nctl.pulse {\n     type pulse\n}\npcm.!default {\n     type pulse\n}\nctl.!default {\n     type pulse\n}\n\nthen reboot.\nNow you should have the audio coming from your pc speaker by default.\nHope this help. \n\nA: I encountered this exact same problem. I found a similar issue in an Arch Linux forum and used this method. \nRun:\npacmd list-cards\n\nYou should get a list of cards you have, and each card will have a list of profiles.  Get the index number of the card you want.  My card index is 0, and the profile I want is called output:analog-stereo\".\nRun:\npacmd set-card-profile 0 output:analog-stereo\n\nEverything works! To make it permanent, I edited /etc/pulse/default.pa and at the bottom put:\nset-card-profile 0      output:analog-stereo\nset-default-sink 1\n\nThis seems to have everything set right after restarting pulseaudio.\n", "Q: Installing LAMP I’m new to Linux and Ubuntu.

(hard drive only) I have an older i386 Sony Vaio desktop PC where the BIOS only allows boot from floppy, CD or very specific USB device types, none of which seem to recognize USB flash drives for some reason. Floppy is not an option because the drive no longer works and I have no media for it if it did. I've tried assorted CD and DVD drives, the CD drives all give read errors and DVD drives all say \"unsupported emulation\".\nMy next possible option that I would like to try, is to install the hard drive into another machine as a second HD and figure out a way to format it and save an Ubuntu installation to run from that HD once it is moved back into the target machine. IS this possible and if so, how would I go about doing so? The currently running machine uses Windows XP. \n\nA: Update:\nIt is not a matter of the hardware being unable to run Ubuntu 13.x, but rather because of Sony's overly proprietary BIOS limitations. The solution that I used successfully unfortunately does not qualify as \"without network connection\", but aside from that, may be useful to others so long as they are able to connect to the internet.\nI created a tiny partition on an otherwise blank hard drive to simulate the size of CD-ROM media, and copied Ubuntu's mini.iso to that partition. The Viao Desktop hardware was able to recognize it as executable during boot and from there, install over the net as if it had been booted using a CD-ROM copy of mini.iso.\n\nA: I have never been in your predicament, and therefore have never tried this, but I quickly threw together a plan.

(within the install folder there is a program called vhdmount, move it's folder to your system32 folder (or where-ever you can easily access it using terminal) and use it to mount the virtualbox vm hard drive, it's a terminal only program so you will need to read up on how to use it.\n\n*You will need to install a partition manager, or use the windows built in manager. Shrink your existing windows parition and create a new parition in the empty space.\n\n*Install \"Ext2 Installable File System for Windows\" it's a freeware that allows creating/using ext2 paritions in windows. Use it to format the newly made parition as ext2. [You will need to verify it allows creation of ext2? It's been a while since I used it, and I cannot install it on my current OS to verify for you, sorry]\n\n*Copy your Ubuntu install from the mounted vhd to the new ext2 parition on your hard drive.\n\n*Install EasyBCD and use it to create an entry for your Ubuntu partition.

However, I cannot seem to get Synaptic to export a list of these packages.\nHence my question is whether it is possible to generate a list of packages that were installed manually via the apt-get install command?\nThe following do not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using apt-mark showmanual. It yields all packages deemed essential as well as manually installed packages. I only want my manually installed packages. \n\n*aptitude search '!~M ~i'. There are way too many packages that are being shown (no way I manually installed > 1000 packages). \n\n*The Python script given by @txwikinger in Generating list of manually installed packages and querying individual packages.

Once again too many packages are shown. \n\n\nThis question is similar in flavor to other questions that have been asked both on Stack Exchange sites and elsewhere (such as Generating list of manually installed packages and querying individual packages, https://serverfault.com/questions/133681/generating-a-list-of-installed-packages-in-ubuntu, and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=947865&page=2). \nDavid Kalnischkies on http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=727799 gives some perspective as to why pinning down exactly what \"manually installed\" means is difficult (e.g. do programs which you ran which installed packages count as \"manually installed\"?). Therefore I have specifically limited this question (unlike the others that I listed) to only invocations of apt-get install.\nEdit: How to view a list of packages that were manually installed without their dependancies has a nice idea for using the log files of apt-get to do this. Unfortunately this doesn't keep track of which packages have been removed. And even if I were to simply grep 'apt-get purge' and take the diff of the two lists that I get it still wouldn't account for the edge case that I've installed a package, uninstalled it, and then reinstalled it. \n\nA: Since no answer using apt has been found, I would suggest going into Synaptic Package Manager, click on the Status button at lower left then click on Installed (manual) at upper left to see a list of installed packages.\n\nThen you can output a list from Synaptic with File | Save Markings As and save the file where you can work with it. \n\nA: I just posted this thought on an earlier page about this, sorry if that's impolite (feel free to remove this if it is) but\n\n\n*\n\n*go get the \"manifest\" file for your version of Ubuntu at http://releases.ubuntu.com/\nas far as I understand it that lists all packages that are in a stock install.\n\n*do apt-mark showmanual to generate a list of all packages apt-mark considers to have been manually installed.\n\n*eliminate the dups between that list and the manifest, leaving the packages in the output of apt-mark showmanual that were not part of the stock installation.\n\n\nProbably this is crude and doesn't deal with the subtlties of what exactly constitutes a \"manually installed\" package, but to me it looks like a pretty good approximation. Or maybe the Synaptic solution is the best.\n", "Q: Trouble installing Ubuntu onto an older intel Pentium 4 machine I am completely new to Linux and that is why I am trying to do is set up an older PC with a 32bit version of Ubuntu.

Same thing for other operators like >>.\nPut this in your ~/.bashrc, then type . ~/.bashrc and try it out.\n# if the command-not-found package is installed, use it\nif [ -x /usr/lib/command-not-found -o -x /usr/share/command-not-found ]; then\n    function command_not_found_handle {\n        if [[ $1 == [0-9+-]* ]]; then\n           echo $(( $@ ))\n        elif [ -x /usr/lib/command-not-found ]; then\n           /usr/bin/python /usr/lib/command-not-found -- $1\n           return $?\n        elif [ -x /usr/share/command-not-found ]; then\n           /usr/bin/python /usr/share/command-not-found -- $1\n           return $?\n        else\n           return 127\n        fi\n    }\nfi\n\nSample output: (I am typing cta, a typo, just to test that our new command_not_found handler will still try to look for unknown commands).\nmp@ubuntu:~$ cta\nNo command 'cta' found, did you mean:\n Command 'cda' from package 'xmcd' (universe)\n Command 'cat' from package 'coreutils' (main)\ncta: command not found\nmp@ubuntu:~$ 9000-1000\n8000\n\n\nA: dc! It's part of coreutils, so it's installed on OS X, Ubuntu, and pretty much EVERYTHING else. It's an RPN calculator, so if you don't like those, it's not for you.\nVery basic commands are as follows (manpage has all the syntax that I didn't include. Exponentiation, anyone?)\nYou only need spaces between numbers. They are ignored in all other cases.\nTyping a number pushes it to the top of the stack.\n+ Adds top 2 items in stack, then pushes result to stack (`2 4 +p` outputs 6)\n- Subtracts top 2 items in stack, then pushes result to stack (`4 2 -p` outputs 2)\n* Multiplies top 2 items in stack, then pushes result to stack (`6 5 *p` outputs 30)\n/ Divides top 2 items in stack, then pushes result to stack (`54 7 /p` outputs 8)\np Print top item in stack, without destroying it\nc Clear stack\nr Swap top 2 items on stack\nd Duplicate top item on stack\nk Pops top item off stack, using it to determine precision (so 10 k would print 10 numbers after the decimal point).

It's a command line scientific calculator . Easy to find in Ubuntu Software Center, or just use apt-get.\nsudo apt-get install wcalc\n\nIt accepts command line arguments as well as has \"shell\" mode:\n# simple operation\n$ wcalc 2+2\n = 4\n# Quoting is necessary to prevent shell from evaluating parenthesis\n$ wcalc \"(2+2)*10\"                                                                                    \n = 40\n$ wcalc \"sqrt(25)\"                                                                                    \n~= 5\n# in shell mode you can evaluate multiple commands repeatedly\n$ wcalc\nEnter an expression to evaluate, q to quit, or ? for help:\n-> 12*20+1\n = 241\n-> sin(90)\n = 1\n-> sin(pi/2)\n = 0.0274121\n\nAnd if someone is in engineering, like myself, you could make use of GNU Octave. It can do all sorts of things, graphing, solving simultaneous equation. Plus it's a free alternative to Matlab \n\nA: simple way is to call python.\nExample:\n>  python -c 'print 10000-9000'\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's no \"easier\" way to do this.  The interactive python interface on the command line is the best suited for what you need, because unlike apcalc\\, python is included in Ubuntu.  I am not sure if bc is included still, however, python is the hands-down favorite for this stuff.\nYou can just run the interactive python interface on the command line, and then do math that way.  You can use that as your calculator.\nTo do that, you open the terminal, type python, then hit the Enter button.\nThen, in the python prompt that shows up, you can type your math in.  For example, 10000 - 9000.  The next line output is the result.\n\nIf you mean, though, something where you just load the terminal and can do this...\n$ 10000 - 9000\n1000\n$\n... then no there's no way to do this in just the terminal without anything else, because Bash doesn't handle numerical arguments like that.\n\nA: What I have found is , I can't trust expr, bc or in-built Shell options. Hence I used Perl which would be normally installed in *linux distro's\nperl -le 'printf \"%.0f\", eval\"@ARGV\"' \"($VAL2-$VAL1)\"\n\nThe above calculation will subtract $VAL1 from $VAL2 and print with no decimal places (0f)\nBenefit with using Perl is (details of Pros & cons listed here)\n\n\n*\n\n*Better error capture (divide by 0 won't stop the calculation)\n\n*Can provide formulae in a config file. No need to escape using complex regex\n\n\nA: You may add following function to your .bashrc file: \nfunction = {\n  echo \"$@\" | bc -l\n}\n\nNote that -l flag is very important. Without it, use of bc gives 5 / 2 = 2.\nAs it was menthioned above, calculations may be done using = sign in front of formula.  \n\nA: I'd advise you to create a simple function for basic Python calculations. Something like this in your .bashrc:\ncalc() {\n    python3 -c 'import sys; print(eval(\" \".join(sys.argv[1:])))' \"$@\"\n}\n\ncalc 5 + 5\n# Returns 10\n\nresult=\"$(calc 5+5)\"\n# Stores the result into a variable\n\nIf you want to do more advanced math, you can use the following one which imports all of the math module's functions. (see here for more info)\ncalc() {\n    python3 -c 'from math import *; import sys; print(eval(\" \".join(sys.argv[1:])))' \"$@\"\n}\n\ncalc 'sqrt(2)'  # Needs quotes because (...) is special in Bash\n# Returns 1.4142135623730951\n\nresult=\"$(calc 'sqrt(2)')\"\n# Stores the result into a variable\n\n(Note: Because Python is a programming language, some things may seems strange, e.g. ** for powers of and % for modulo)\nAlternatively you can create a Python script calc,\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nfrom math import *\nimport sys\nprint(eval(' '.join(sys.argv[1:])))\n\nplace it in a directory included in the PATH variable and set its executable flag to get the same calc command as above (no need to create a Bash function to run a Python script).\nIf you want a method in pure Bash, use steeldriver's answer. This answer is only really beneficial if you need the more advanced functions (i.e. from math), as Python is relatively slow compared to Bash.\n\nI'm not sure if this breaks your \"switch to python it can do that & I don’t want it in such a way.\" note, but you don't need to enter the interactive prompt and the result is accessible in Bash so this answer seems valid (to me, at least).\n\nA: Use the gcalccmd from gnome-calculator (>=13.04) or gcalctool (<13.04) package. I think the package is installed by default\n% gcalccmd\n> 2+3\n5\n> 3/2\n1.5\n> 3*2\n6\n> 2-3\n−1\n> \n\n\nA: In the past, I've used wcalc and a little program called e that's pretty much impossible to google for.

These are the two parts of my query:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to mount all USB storage/flash/removable storage devices as read-only i.e. set the default mount policy to read-only? Back in Windows OS, I could achieve write-protection for USB storage devices with some registry tweaks. How can I do that in Ubuntu?\n\n*Using dconf-editor I can control the automount, automount-open, autorun,... (schema: org.cinnamon.desktop.media-handling), but Nautilus will always allow the devices to be mounted in a single click ! I don't want that! So can I control mount options that appear in nautilus under the Devices menu of sidebar? Or is there a better way so that only the Root is able to mount such devices? I tried setting permissions in/to /dev/bus/usb with no luck at all.\n\nA: Most USB flash drives are formatted with FAT32. This is a simple filesystem with no journaling or other fancy features. Data is only written if metadata or file contents get modified unless you set the mount policy to read-only. For Linux distributions, you could do this by adding the ro option when manually mounting a partition with the mount program.\nYou are now looking at desktop programs (Nautilus) which does not use mount directly (it does not even have permissions to do so). It likely uses UDisks instead (actually, udisks2). In the manual page udisks(8) you can find some variables that can be used with udev. To hide a partition from Nautilus for example, have a look at this answer.\nI am not aware of an option to set the default mount policy, but you can certainly specify a mount option when manually mounting as root:\nudisksctl mount --options ro ...\n\nChanging the permissions of /dev/bus/XXX/YYY is nonsense. Normal users are able to mount external storage because there is a privileged daemon running (udisksd) that operates on behalf of the user.\n", "Q: Switching from Unity to KDE login screen problem I switched from ubuntu to kubuntu today using apt-get install kubuntu-desktop, which worked fine except from the fact that the login screen that pops up when I boot up my computer is still the unity login screen. Is there any way I can change it? I've been looking for a few hours now and I have no clue... (I'm using 13.10)\n\nA: Most desktop environments have their own desktop manager (aka login screen) however it typically doesn't auto install along with the desktop environment. Unity uses lightdm, Kde uses kdm, and gnome uses gdm. You can have multiple installed but only 1 can be used at a time. You just need to install KDM and set it as your default desktop manager.\nStep 1:\nInstall KDM by typing \"sudo apt-get install kdm\" in the terminal\nStep 2:\nIn your control panel both lightdm and kdm will be listed and allow you to change which is your default. You can also do this via terminal commands but I can't recall them off hand.\n[Please note: KDM comes with several themes pre-installed, the default used theme is not the one that is used as default in the offical kubuntu iso, that theme is included in kdm though, so all you will need to do to change it to your default theme is go to your control panel and under kdm you can change themes].\n", "Q: Why apt-get prompt me to run -f install and it cannot be run properly?

Maybe the knowledge-base we have about this is getting old, irrelevant for newest hardware components ?\nMy machine\n\nLinux 3.8.0-33-generic #48~precise1-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) on a Sony VAIO, and the following AMD graphic card :\n\nVGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Thames [Radeon HD 7550M/7570M/7650M]\n\nMost of the solutions I found where meant for Nvidia graphics, which is why I'm getting quite limited...\nThe problem\nBasically, I can't change my brightness level.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the GUI in Settings, All settings, Brightness and lock, I can \"change\" the brightness value, but nothing actually happens.\n\n*Using the Fn + F5/F6 keys triggers a desktop notification displaying the new brightness value, but still : nothing changes.\n\n\nWhat I've tried\nIt's important to know that this problem hasn't been there forever. On my first Ubuntu install, everything was quite functional when it comes to brightness. Then, because I got quite bored of Ubuntu, I decided to switch to Arch Linux, and I'm now back on Ubuntu for my primary desktop machine. However now, setting the brightness is not possible anymore, which means I have to use my screen at full brightness everytime, even when I'm on battery...\nAs I said, I tried as many solutions as I was able to find :\n\n\n*\n\n*I edited the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX GRUB setting, with acpi_osi=Linux. Files were created into /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0 (actual_brightness, brightness and max_brightness), but even though their content changes as I set my brightness higher or lower, no change is effective.\n\n*Same thing, adding acpi_backlight=vendor. The /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0 link/directory disappeared. Control keys do not trigger notifications anymore, and changing the setting using the GUI is no longer possible.\n\n*I tried using xbacklight. No error, but no changes.\n\n\nHas anyone got any experience with those problems ?\n\nProblem solved!\nHere's the workaround I've made from S Prasanth's answer. Root terminal required.\nIn a /usr/bin/brightness_change file, I've placed this script :\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ $# -ne 1 ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: brightness_change [level]\" > /dev/stderr\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ ! -w /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness ]; then\n    echo \"Brightness settings are not available.\" > /dev/stderr\n    exit 2\nfi\n\nTIMEOUT=4\nendTime=$(($(date +%s)+$TIMEOUT))\nwhile [ $(date +%s) -lt $endTime ]\ndo\n    echo $1 | tee -a /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness > /dev/null 2> /dev/null\ndone\n\nThis script will NOT always give a satisfying result. It usually has to be run several times before succeeding. Also, remember to set its rights and ownership correctly :\nchown root:root /usr/bin/brightness_change\nchmod 0755 /usr/bin/brightness_change\n\nNow, in my /etc/sudoers file :\nALL ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/brightness_change\n\nThis way, anyone can execute sudo brightness_change without the need of a password.\nFor further improvements : you may want to connect this script to your ACPI events, in order to trigger a brightness change when your laptop goes on battery, on gets plugged-in.\nNote : this problem seems to have been fixed in the newest versions of the driver, my hotkeys are now fully functional.\n\nA: Mine's nvidia so nothing mentioned in this post is from first hand experience.\nApparently, this is an issue with the latest fglrx drivers in 12.04: Last couple of fglrx drivers on Ubuntu 12.04 have backlight support broken.\n\nWorkarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*The guy who asked that question, in his first answer mentions that pressing and holding the brightness keys for a few seconds changes brightness - or at least toggles between the highest and lowest possible settings. See if this works.\n\n*In the same answer, he's provided this link: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1269560#p1269560 which provides a very weird workaround. Apparently, although writing to /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness doesn't work, writing to the file very frequently for a short period of time works. The code snippet suggested in the link is:\nwhile :; do echo 10 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness ; done\nin a root shell. You can terminate this while loop in a few seconds and apparently the brightness changes. If this works you can do the following:\nAdd the following lines to ~/.bashrc\nfunction chbrightness {\n    TIMEOUT=5\n    endTime=$(($(date +%s)+$TIMEOUT))\n    chbrightness_string=\"\n        while [ \\$(date +%s) -lt $endTime ]\n        do\n            echo $1 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n        done\n    \"\n    sudo bash -c \"$chbrightness_string\"\n}\n\nSet TIMEOUT appropriately. To change brightness, simply run chbrightness <value> from terminal and provide the sudo password.\n\nIn his later answer, he mentions that a newer driver from the amd site partially fixes the issue. You may go ahead and install this or stick to the workaround (assuming it works) till the fixed drivers make it into the repositories.\n", "Q: Keyboard stop working after GRUB My keyboard works fine in bios, it even works when I enter GRUB which unetbootin created.

They are usually found in a package called libwhatever-dev, in this case libv8-dev which needs to be installed.\nYou then need the line:\n#include <v8.h>\n\nto include the V8 headers. When compiling, you'll also need to tell g++ to link with the v8 library (-lv8). V8 is a fairly complex beast, and it would probably be wise to find a working example or tutorial to see how they compile it.\nFinally, a note on terminology: a script normally refers to code which is executed directly from the readable text form by an interpreter (such as python), whereas this has to be first compiled before it can be run.\n", "Q: Unable to launch Skype in Ubuntu 13.10 64bit - Symbol Lookup Error I installed Skype from the Ubuntu Software Centre.

I am a user of Ubuntu with not much experience and I have been using sudo.\nWhat does sudo !! do and how?\n\nA: !! in bash is an alias for the previous command (see Event Designators). So it re-runs the previous command with sudo permissions.\n\nA: sudo bang bang is a very useful command when working in Command Line Interface.\nSome Linux distros have you login as a user instead of an administrator.\nSo, to do something admin-wise, you have to proceed the command with sudo (Super-User DO), which tells the system “you will do this, because I said so.” The !! / bang-bang (! = bang) is basically a shortcut you can use to repeat the previous command. \nSo, typical scenario is that you try a command, and it kicks back a message saying you have to be an admin to do that. So, you can either type sudo to run that command as super-user/admin, or you can type sudo !! where !! tells the system to use the previous command that was attempted.UfH\nThere are many other bang-commands.  For a list of them and explanations to what they are, check out Linux Bang Commands, see also Bash history and bang commands\n\nA: !! is the syntactically simplest and probably most common expression for history expansion.\nAs you may have noticed, after substituting the last command executed for !!, bash does two things (in its default configuration):\n\n\n*\n\n*The full command with the substituted text is shown to you.\nFor example, if your command was lshw -c video and you run sudo !! next, then the command after history expansion is sudo lshw -c video.\n\n*That command is run.\nNormally these two steps occur without interruption and with no opportunity for user interaction, because shopt histverify is unset by default (shopt -u histverify).\nHowever, if you enable shopt histverify (shopt -s histverify) then history expansion works differently:\n\n\n*\n\n*You get a new primary prompt, with the expanded text automatically entered on it. It is as if you had typed that text yourself, with the cursor at the end, but have not yet run the command.\n\n*You, the user, must then press Enter to run the command. Or you may edit the command, cancel it (Ctrl+C), etc. Note that this is not a special prompt, but a regular primary prompt. It really is as though you typed the text yourself.\n\n\n(Note that the histverify shell option takes effect only if the readline library is being used--but when you use bash interactively on an Ubuntu or other GNU/Linux system, this is essentially always the case.)\nWhether or not the histverify shell option is enabled, history expansion is dissimilar to many other shell expansions. Other shell expansions do not show you the expanded command before it is run. Unlike other expansions, which are intended to be used both interactively and noninteractively (for example, in a shell script), history expansion is almost always used interactively.\n\nA: The bang bang (!!) command is a shortcut to repeat and run the previous command you entered in your terminal. This command is very useful when you forget that you need admin rights to make a certain action, and lets you repeat it with super-user rights just by typing,\nsudo !!\n\n!! grabs the last run command.\nFor example:\napt-get update\n\nThe output will be,\n\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\n\nAfter that,if we run sudo !! command,the output will be\nHit http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy/main amd64 Packages\nGet:3 http://mirror.sov.uk.goscomb.net saucy-updates Release.gpg [933 B]\nHit http://ppa.launchpad.net saucy Release                                  \nHit http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy/main i386 Packages \nHit http://mirror.sov.uk.goscomb.net saucy Release                             \n99% [Waiting for headers] [Waiting for headers] [Waiting for headers]\n\nWhich means !! part grabs the previous run command apt-get update and the  preceeding sudo part makes the command to run with superuser rights.\nAnd how the sudo !! runs the previous command with superuser privileges means,normally all the commands we entered on the terminal are stored in the command history.Run the history command on the terminal,it shows all the commands you entered.The !! part in the sudo !! grabs the last command stored in the command history and the whole sudo !! runs the last command with admin privileges.\nSome other bang commands are explained in this blog post.\n\nA: ! is used in Linux for history related shortcuts. So, !! will simply run the previous command you executed.\nIt's very helpful in cases when you either forget to put sudo before a command that requires it or you get Permission Denied or something like that just do sudo !! and you're done.\n\nA: There are two parts to the answer: !! and sudo\n!! is part of the functionality of the shell (in the case of Ubuntu this is probably bash, but other shells like zsh or csh support this, too) called \"history expansion\". It behaves in a similar way as other expansions in that the shell expands the 'placeholder' to a set of words. While foo* would be expanded to a list of all files starting with 'foo', !! gets expanded to the contents of the previous command line. \n$ echo foobar\nfoobar\n$ echo !!\necho foobar\n$ !!\necho foobar\n\nLike other expansions, this is done entirely by the shell, so if you type !! after some other command, this command is not aware that there was a !!, but will only see the previous command line. (Unlike other expansions, history expansion happens before a command is saved in the history, that is instead of !! the replaced command line will be saved to the history.)\n\nThe sudo command allows executing commands as another user, provided the permissions ar granted by the security policy (default is configured in /etc/sudoers). \nBy default the root password remains unset in Ubuntu. In order to perform system administration tasks the user created during installation is granted sudo rights. This user can now execute any command on the shell as root, just by prepending sudo. Some GUI programs use the sudo mechanism, too, for example package management.\nThe reason why sudo can execute other commands as root (or another user) is that the sudo binary (/usr/bin/sudo) has the setuid bit set in its permission and belongs to root. Any (binary) executable with set setuid bit is run with the permissions of its owner. This means that sudo runs effectively with root permissions no matter which user actually called it. Only he internal security policies of sudo manage which user is allowed what and prevent arbitrary users to do arbitrary things.\n\nSo, in the case of sudo !! this means\n$ mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nmount: only root can do that\n$ sudo !!\n\nis basically identical to\n$ mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nmount: only root can do that\n$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\njust less typing. In both cases sudo just sees mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt and runs it with root permissions.\n\nA: !! will repeat and run the previous command , and with sudo it will give the command the root privilege. \n ( It is not in man page ?!!  I can not see it there.)\n", "Q: How to display my name and the icon menu on ubuntu 13.10?

Now when I restart the PC, it directly boots to Ubuntu. What happened to my Windows 7 and how I can make it dual boot?\n\nA: I have installed Ubuntu from a DVD. During installation process I was asked about options to install as only simple system or dual system or other. So make sure what you've selected before installation, it's decisively the right point.\n\nA: At the start of Ubuntu installation, when Preparing to Install window appears, it presents you with following options   \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu alongside your other systems (e.g. alongside Windows). You shold have selected this option in your case if you want to create a dual boot system.\n\n*Erase disk and install Ubuntu (Install Ubuntu over your entire hard drive). If you have selected this option by any chance, Ubuntu has formatted and overwritten your Windows partition. You may have to reinstall Windows and then Ubuntu after that to get back to a dual boot system once again.\n\n*Something else (use manual options for installations, like partitioning hard drive and then install).\n\nA: There is a software on ubuntu called Gparted that lets you see what's on your hard drive. To access it, go to Terminal and type\nsudo gparted\n\nAnd enter your root/ubuntu password. \nIf it says you don't have it, download it with\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nand then try the first command again. This software can cause loss of data if you use it without knowing it well enough, so read the warnings carefully if you plan on changing something. For now, you don't need to change anything.\nLook for a partition with data type \"NTFS\" or \"ntfs\" : it's the windows part of your hard drive. The Linux part is generally \"ext4\" for home use. Two cases :\n1) If you have only an \"EFI\" partition and \"ext4\" partition, maybe a \"swap\" one too, and NO \"NTFS\", congratulations, you've deleted Windows. ^^\" If you had anything worthwhile on your disk, I suggest you bring your hard drive to a data recovery center and use your computer as little as possible until then, as it will make data recovery harder. This will remind you to backup your data before any OS manipulations...\nOr if you don't care about what was on there and just want your dual-boot : reinstall windows from scratch while erasing everything on your disk in the Windows installer menu (by booting with a Windows CD or Live USB of the Windows distribution of your choice). Then once Windows is installed, pick up your Ubuntu Live USB and this time, pick the \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows\" option. From then on, your computer should recognize both.\n2) If you do have an NTFS partition, or had to follow part 1) and your windows is still unrecognized, then windows is quite probably still there, it's just not recognized by your Linux-centric computer.\nThe key to fixing this is a software called GRUB (or GRUB2) that allows your computer to pick an OS when it boots. It's basically a black screen on startup with the choice of \"ubuntu\", \"memtest\", \"setup\", and \"windows\".\nTo work, Grub needs a) to be installed, b) information about which OS exists in the machine. \nsudo apt-get install grub\n\nwill install grub, you might already have it.\nsudo update-grub\n\nwill have grub check the hard drive for the OSs present. It will then correct the grub boot menu (or have it appear for the first time, if your computer used to boot to Linux automatically).\nNormally that should fix your problem. On startup, you should be able to pick between Windows and Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to use WiFi connection on Nexus 4?

A few things in your current config are going to mess this up.  First, from Comp1, is this line:\naddress 10.10.0.0\n\nYou can't have a .0 last octet as an address with a /24 range (which is what the 255.255.255.0 netmask gets you) - and unless you really, really need them, then don't use them in general.  Make this a different address - you have 254 others to choose from.  Let's just go with 10.10.0.1 here.\nSince you have 10.140.20.20 configured on eth0 on this machine, it will be able to use that IP address (via eth0), so your gateway statement should work.\nHowever, this line will not work on comp2:\ngateway 10.140.20.20\n\nComp2 has no way to know how to get to this IP address.  The only thing it knows about is the /24 network you have configured.  It will be able to see any other address in that range, and that is it.  This gateway address is not in that range, so it can't see the gateway you have configured.  In fact, with a 2 host network, the only thing it can see is the address for Comp1.  Therefore you need to change this to be the IP that you specify for Comp1.  Assuming the address we mention above, this entry should therefore read:\ngateway 10.10.0.1\n\nYou can leave your DNS entry unchanged.  Now that you have a reachable gateway, it will simply send the packets to the gateway if it does not know where the address actually is.\nFor this to work, Comp1 will need to be able to route packets from Comp2, which means enabling routing on Comp1.  This is easy to do on the fly:\n sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nIf you want to make that permanent you will need to add the setting to /etc/sysctl.conf.\nNow, what will happen is that any packet destined for the internet, or any other unknown host for that matter on Comp2 will be sent to Comp1.  Since Comp1 is now configured to route that packet, it will receive it on eth1, and pass it on to eth2.\n", "Q: Upgrading Ubuntu Server to a recent version would update PHP too?

I want to remove unnecessary services in Ubuntu server 13.04 for hardening purpose.\nI don't know use which blow command for dedicate services:\n1. inintct list\n2. sysv-rc-conf list\n3. ls /etc/init.d\n4. service --status-all\nwhy outputs of each above command are different?\nI tried stop atd service with \"service atd stop\", but after reboot system this\nservice start again.\nSince I want hardening my server, how to disable a service permanently?\nand which services should be disable?\nThanks.\n\nA: /etc/init.d holds the start up/shut down scripts for various services, but they are actually invoked by the scripts in /etc/rc*.d.\nThe rc*.d scripts are actually hold symbolic links to /etc/init.d scripts, and the names in the rc*.d directories say whether to start or stop a service as you enter that run level - the number in the name gives the order in which to run the scripts.\nSo, for example, /etc/rc3.d/S23ntp says to start the ntp daemon at run level 3 (after all the lower numbered services have been started). \nSo - to stop a service running after a reboot, the best thing to do is manipulate the rc*.d scripts.\nAnd the best way to do that is to use the update-rc.d command. e.g. to disable ntp at boot, run:\nupdate-rc.d ntp disable\n\nAs to what services to disable - be careful that you understand what a service does and its purpose before disabling it.\nI was going to give atd as an example - this is a process that uses very little resource, but stopping it may have unintended consequences.\nBut as it turns out, atd is actually invoked by a different mechanism (upstart) - and I don't have time to go in to that now!\n\nA: I do not recommend you to disable services you don't know of, to disable services that ship with the system you have to have deeper knowledge of the system. You could likely end up with a broken system.\nSince it seems you do not know about SysV-init scripts or Upstart jobs, i would suggest you get in touch with them first.\nTake a look at this tutorial.\n\nA: You can manage services on startup with rcconf:\nsudo apt-get install rcconf\n\nThen, start it:\nsudo rcconf\n\nAnd uncheck the ones you don't want loaded automatically on startup.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server cannot boot - HDD problems I have major problem, my Ubuntu Server won't start up after reboot, guys in Hetzner datacenter started recsue sistem up and found out this on sda:\n-----------------%<-----------------\n5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   001   001   036    Pre-fail  Always\nFAILING_NOW 4095\n-----------------%<-----------------\n\nThere are 3 x 1.5TB HDDs in RAID5 and on sda there was boot loader.\nThey insisted to replace sda with new HDD, so I confirmed.\nAfter that they mailed me back with another thing, sdc is also corrupted...\nUntil 7:30 this morning everything worked fine.

I'm on Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS.\nWhat worked for me:\nI updated the installed software packages, after which the problem was gone.\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: For me, the problem happened because I had restarted the router and the IP address of the printer had changed. I went into the printer configuration in Ubuntu and updated the IP address (which I took from the printer's Network Summary printout) and it worked again after that.\n\nA: As proposed in the comments, removing the printer and adding it again worked for me. \nI did empty the var/spool/cups directory before, but I don't know if this deletion had an impact. I didn't use the HP Device Manager.\n\nA: Start a print job, look into the cups error logs:\nsudo tail -n 100 -f /var/log/cups/error_log\n\nCheck if it is failing due to a missing library.

A substantial fraction of packages will need replacing, because either:\n\n\n*\n\n*The new Ubuntu release contains a newer version of the package, or\n\n*The package version is similar, but because libraries in the base system have been updated upon which it depends, it has been rebuilt to work with them\n\n\nI'm afraid the answer is that using the short term releases (12.10, 13.04, 13.10) does require a relatively large amount of bandwidth to keep updated. If you don't want to update on a 6-monthly cycle (with associated bandwidth usage), the LTS version (12.04 and probably 14.04 when available) allows you to keep the base system for 5 years from release.\n\nA: If you want to save all the bandwidth you can, start removing software you don't need/use. You can use deborphan to help you with the task of looking for orphan installed packages. \nYou can also consider downloading the ISO image and do a clean installation. Normally the upgrade manager will tell you the amount of data that will be downloaded. You should calculate if it would be easier to download just the ISO or to upgrade.\nLast resort could be asking a friend without bandwidth cap to download the packages for you.\n", "Q: Fresh Ubuntu install, problems with existing partitions I wish to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with a clean install.

While selecting, 'erasing disk and re-install' the next screen shows, ' the entire disk will be used'.\nI tried to create/change partitions but got confused there... should I delete already existing partitions and create new ones or just re-size them?\n\nA: it depends on you whether you want to format them or not, if you do format them you will lose all the data. If you'd like to create right partitions only for Ubuntu you can read this article about required and optional partitions in Ubuntu: DiskSpace/Partitioning\n", "Q: Where are iptables's rulesets stored on Ubuntu 12.04? Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - iptables v1.4.12\nTLDR:\nWhere are iptables's rulesets saved when invoking iptables-save <ruleset-name> ?\nExplanation:\nAccording to this answer basic way of saving iptables's rules is invoking \niptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4\nip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6\n\nand afterwards loading/restoring these rules in /etc/network/interfaces like:\niface eth0 inet static\n        ....\n        pre-up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4\n        pre-up ip6tables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v6\n\n... or putting these into a shell script in /etc/network/if-pre-up.d. \n\nThis can be simplified by installing the iptables-persistent package.\nsudo apt-get install iptables-persistent\ninovoke-rc.d iptables-persistent save\nupdate-rc.d iptables-persistent defaults\n\n\nFollowing some tutorials i tried to invoke service iptables status ( a non-existant/unknown command for the iptables version/package that comes pre-installed with 12.04 ) and found this interesting output:\nAborting iptables initd: unknown command(s): \"status\".                                                               \n  ...                                                                                  \n  save <ruleset>                                                                                                    \n     save the current ruleset                                                                                       \n  load <ruleset>                                                                                                    \n     load a ruleset                                                                                                 \n   ...                                                                                                   \nSaved rulesets:                                                                                                     \n  active, inactive                                                                                 \n...     \n\nThere seem to be two rulesets i can load (active and inactive) ...\n.. but where are these stored? \nI can't find their location as active/inactive are pretty bad search terms and dpkg-query -L iptables doesn't help either.\nAs i'm provisioning my servers with puppet/chef it would be nice to know wether there is some place i can put my rulesets and add a simple shell script to /etc/networking/if-pre-up to load these.\nThen i could ommit the iptables-persistent package which ain't that flexible as it doesn't allow loading different rulesets. \nThanks for your help.\n\nA: iptables stores the rules in memory but the ruleset created by iptables-save ruleset-name can be found in the file\n/var/lib/iptables/ruleset-name\nThese can be restored by invoking iptables-restore <ruleset-name>. \nI can only confirm this for Ubuntu 12.04.03 LTS - maybe this location has changed in later versions of the iptables-package.\nI think something like /etc/iptables/rulesets.d would have been a more logical place to store these.\nThe save-path is configured in /etc/init.d/iptables at line 27 and afterwards used by initd_save() which invokes initd_counters().\nlibdir=/var/lib/iptables   \n\n# ...\n\ninitd_counters () {                                                                                         \n if test \"${enable_save_counters:-false}\" = true; then                                                     \n    echo -n \" with counters\"                                                                                \n    $iptables_save -c > \"$ruleset\"                                                                          \n  else                                                                                                      \n    $iptables_save | sed '/^:/s@\\[[0-9]\\{1,\\}:[0-9]\\{1,\\}\\]@[0:0]@g' > \"$ruleset\"                           \n  fi                                                                                                        \n}        \n\ninitd_save () {                                                                                             \n  rm -f $autosave                                                                                           \n  ruleset=\"${libdir}/$@\"                                                                                    \n  echo -n \"Saving iptables ruleset: save \\\"$@\\\"\"                                                            \n  initd_counters                                                                                           \n  echo \".\"                                                                                                  \n}          \n\n", "Q: How can I prevent Supervisor to run at startup?

You can also search on man md5sum for more information about the process.\nYou see, the file download process is not perfect, and can result in a saved file which does not match the original file. Therefore, the MD5sum program (and its Windows counterpart, the Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290 is used to see if the downloaded file exactly matches the original file. \n", "Q: System trashed after recommended Ubuntu updates- what do I do? everything running fine when Ubuntu messaged me it had a large number of updates to install.

It is apparently a non-unique case since there is already a bug report for this (see this bug report). I am using Ubuntu 13.10.\n\nA: I have the same problem here, but I'm using this workaround:\nGo to \"System Settings > Text Entry\". Under \"Input sources to use\", add your keyboard layout if it still doesn't exist, then move it to the top of all layouts you already have. Or, if you prefer, you can simply delete all the layouts you don't need and keep only the one you want (that's what I've done here).\nNow, open the \"Startup Applications\", click on Add and do the following:\n\nName: KeyLaySet (This is made up.

If I'd to hook a function or a program that should execute when the system clipboard content is changed then of which file I've to keep checking or which event is fired and how to catch that event by a programming language? Or a command that can output clipboard content to the terminal so that I can keep running command after short intervals and see if the content has been changed or not.\nThanks\n\nA: xclip is your friend. Look at the manpage for more information, but if you want to set the clipboard (not the selected text), you can use xclip -sel clip, then pipe to its stdin to set the clipboard.\nThere's a -i filename parameter to read from a file. -sel selects the clipboard buffer you want to use. There's p (primary, if you select something. It's what middleclick pastes), clip, which is the one used with CTRL-C and CTRL-V in all modern desktop environments (QT2 and Emacs 20 use the primary clipboard for some reason).\nTo get the contents of the clipboard, xclip -sel clip -o (prints to stdout). If you want to put it in a file, there's an optional parameter of -o to specify a file to send it to.\nI believe there's some information in the manpage to wait for when the clipboard changes. I just couldn't decipher it.\nInfos here: http://standards.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt\n\nA: There are several frameworks available which support clipboards and such a behavior.\nThere is for instance GTK which provides a Gdk Event GtkClipboard-owner-change which always gets fired when content in the clipboard has changed. An application can be written in a programming language which supports GTK such as C, Python or Vala.\nIn Vala following snippet could for instance being used to print to stdout when a clipboard content has changed\nnamespace ClipboardChanged\n{\n    public static int main (string[] args)\n    {\n        Gtk.init (ref args);\n\n        Gtk.Clipboard clipboard = Gtk.Clipboard.get(Gdk.SELECTION_CLIPBOARD);\n        clipboard.owner_change.connect(() => {\n            stdout.printf(\"Clipboard has changed\\n\");\n        });\n\n        Gtk.main();\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\nThis code snippet can be saved in a text file e.g. clipboard-changed.vala and be compiled with valac with the following command\nvalac --pkg=gtk+-3.0 clipboard-changed.vala\n\nOf course for this to work valac needs to be installed\nsudo apt-get install valac\n\nThere is only one shortcoming in this though that it only works with the main clipboard but not with primary selection (selection of content with the mouse).\n", "Q: NVIDIA drivers for Geforce 720m on Ubuntu 13.10 I have an Asus notebook equipped with a GeForce 720m graphic card.

I am having this set up at the moment : \n\nand I would like to give the unallocated space between /dev/sda3/ and /dev/sda4 to /dev/sda5`. How can I do that now ? \n\nA: There are some steps you must follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must fix your NTFS partition that is dirty. Boot up Windows, open the command line and type chkdsk /f X:, changing X for each of the letter of your volumes. Reboot twice.\n\n*Now with a Live CD without any mounted partition, redimension the sda4 extended partition to fill the unallocated space. Now that space will be inside the extended partition.\n\n*Now redimension/move the partitions as you like to fill the now \"free space\".\n\n\nThat's all\n\nA: You have to do this on a live CD, unmount all your partitions, including swap, and do it in steps. Right now sda5 and sda6 are mounted, so you can not work with them.\nFrom a live CD, first unmount all your partitions (you  can do this in the gparted menu).\nThen, in steps, -> Increase the size of sda4 -> apply changes -> increase the size of sda5 -> apply changes.\n", "Q: creating multiple partitions I am installing Ubuntu 12.04, just removed all the existing partitions which had earlier Windows Xp and Ubuntu 13.04.

What next for me? Should I increase /home\nand how to create some additional drives/partitions. any help will be helpful.\nNote: I do not want a dual boot at all. Only ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: For a modern one-user (or mainly one-user) workstation, partitioning is more a matter of taste than other thing. I commented more extensively here.\nIf you are sure yo do not want other OS installed (even in the future), I would expand the /home partition to fill the disk (and maybe leaving a bit more space for /, although I never filled it up.)\nMy normal routine when installing from scratch is to create / and /home, and then moving /usr/local and /opt in the home partition, and then linking them back. Some on the line of (as root):\ncp -rva /usr/local /home \nmv /usr/local /usr/local.old\nln -s /home/local /usr/local\n\nand (normally /opt does not exist) \nmkdir /home/opt \nln -s /home/opt /opt\n\nThis kind of configuration will let you reinstall another Linux operating system without touching your data (even locally compiled programs will stay under /home/local, and you have to just re-do the links when reinstalling).\nAnother possibility (quite more complex, but interesting) is to learn to use LVM:  : in that way you can resize the partition on the fly if you want. \n\nA: Partitioning is more an art then a science. Personally I would dedicate 40 Gb to your root partition, 40 Gb for /home and the rest in a back up or data partition. You can give it all to /home if you do not want a separate data partition.\n", "Q: Code works in terminal but not in script for renaming (manipulate filenames with spaces) I want to learn more so I have tried to script more than just using the terminal. I know rename and I can rename image files with rename 's/ /_/g' *.jpg but when I write it in a shell script to point at a directory:\nDIRECTORY=\"/foo/bar\"\n\nfor imgfile in $(find $DIRECTORY -type f -name \\*.jpg); do\n    echo 'replacing whitespace in' $(basename $imgfile)\n    rename -f 's/ /_/g' *.jpg \ndone\n\nit doesn't work and the terminal will take a file (example: 1234 abcd.jpg) and echo abcd.jpg.  So where am I going wrong?\n\nA: Spaces in filenames are evil. \nI see three problems with the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*when doing the for... loop, you will have two different values when you find a file with space. i.e., if you have the files \"file1 1.jpg\" and \"file2 2.jpg\" and you do:\nfor i in $(find . -type f -name \\*.jpg); do \n   echo $i\ndone\n\nYou'll have \n./file1 \n1.jpg\n./file2\n2.jpg\n\nbecause the shell breaks the argument at spaces. The output of the $(find ...) command will be \n./file1 1.jpg \n./file2 2.jpg \n\nWhich are four words for the command for to be assigned at $i --- by default the shell treats spaces and newlines in the same way when expanding. \nYou can circumvent this changing the IFS char.\nYour first line could look like:\nIFS=$'\\n' find $DIRECTORY -type f -name \\*.jpg | while read -r imgfile; do\n\n\n*you are feeding the for loop with a single file name, so you should say: \nrename -f 's/ /_/g' \"$imgfile\"\n\notherwise *.jpg is expanded in the current directory, and not in $DIRECTORY (and note the quotes --- given that $imgfile is going to have spaces in it).\n\n*even then, if $DIRECTORY has some path component with spaces in it, the rename  will fail (there will be intermediate directories that do not exist). \n\n*suggestion (keeping it simple):\nDIRECTORY=\"/foo/bar\"\ncd $DIRECTORY\nrename -f 's/ /_/g' *.jpg\n\ndoesn't do what you want? \nAdded: my script (created ages ago, when there was no rename in Unix), is this --- it will remove spaces and tab in all files in current dir that have them in the name: \n# \nls -1  | grep -E \" |\\t\" | while read i; do\n    a=`echo $i | tr \" \\t\" \"__\"`\n    mv -v \"$i\" $a\ndone\n\nAdded++: this link I found researching this answer is excellent. \n\nA: Best way to parse the result from find is by null terminate the output with -print0\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile IFS= read -d '' -r; do\n    rename -f \"s/ /_/g\" \"$REPLY\"\n    if [[ ! -f $REPLY ]]; then\n        echo \"Renaming file: $(basename \"$REPLY\")\"\n    fi\ndone < <(find -type f -name '*.jpg' -print0)\n\n\n(You can manage without a loop).\n$ find -type f -name '*.jpg' \\\n    -exec bash -c 'rename -f \"s/ /_/g\" \"$1\"; \\\n    [[ -f $1 ]] || echo \"Renaming file: $(basename \"$1\")\"' _ '{}' \\;\n\n", "Q: My NTFS partition no longer automounts Linux used to automount my windows.

But by experimenting around this solution you should be able to get it to work.\nLet's say you want to work from PC1 and play sounds on both PC1 and PC2.\n\nOn both PC1 and PC2:\nInstall PulseAudio Preferences:\nsudo apt-get install paprefs\n\nOn PC1 only:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PulseAusio Preferences dialog (from Dash, say).\n\n*In the Network Access tab enable Make discoverable PulseAudio network....

This makes the sound device in PC2 visible to PC1.\n\n*Do not check Don't require authentication - that will allow others on the LAN to spam your sound system.\n\n\nProviding authentication:\nCopy ~/.pulse-cookie file from one of the PCs to the other, so that that file is identical in both PCs. It doesn't matter which PC's file is copied to the other.\n\nAt this point (possibly after rebooting the two PCs), you should be able to play sounds from PC1 on PC2's sound system:\nOn PC1\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the volume control dialog.\n\n*In the Output tab change to PC2's sound device (Under the list \"Play sound through\").\n\n*Play some sample audio in PC1 and verify that you can hear the output in PC2.\n\n\n\nNow you want the sound server on PC1 to forward sounds to both sound devices (available locally to it). For this you have to create a virtual sound device whose slaves are the two available devices. An easy of doing this is\nOn PC1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PulseAudio Preferences dialog.\n\n*In the Simultaneous Output tab, enable Add virtual....\n\n*From the volume control dialog, choose this virtual output device.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simultaneous output on all local sound cards may not be desirable, in which case you should take a look at pacmd's module-combine option to combine only select sinks.\n\n*If you wish to work from either PC1 or PC2 and want all sounds to play on both PCs, perform PC1 and PC2 specific steps on both PC1 and PC2.\n\n*Hopefully the network is strong enough that no noticeable sync errors will creep in.

To add a new Kernel to the list of boot options, get the packages from here:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n\nYou'll need to match your Ubuntu version, and your 32 or 64 bit system type.\nDownload those files to your /tmp partition using wget or something similar, and run:\nsudo dpkg -i linux-*.deb\n\nOptionally, to remove an old Kernel, find the right version number then run:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-YYYYYY*\n\nOnce a Kernel is installed it will be available to select at boot time.

My friend downloaded Ubuntu onto my laptop for me and when I restarted it after being asked for my password, it will not load past the boot options menu.\nI do not have another computer to use and I am wondering if I can reload Ubuntu off of a passport or 7GB SD card.\n\nA: The Passport (TM) external hard drive would have to be created as a bootable hard drive for Linux, and Western Digital doesn't do that. You'd need a booting Linux computer to make the Passport bootable, and the process would erase the entire contents of that hard drive as it came formatted for NTFS instead.  \nLikewise, you would need a booting Linux computer to make that SD card bootable, and many laptops won't boot from an SD card.\nTherefore, your best choice is to find a working Windows or Linux computer and with that, redownload the Ubuntu ISO file and apply that onto a USB Flash Drive ($10 or less at most supermarkets and department stores in the Anglosphere) or a CD-R disc (but in disc-at-a-time mode, not using either packet writing or track-at-a-time mode).\n", "Q: \"anachronistic crom\" messages when booting up My screen shows this message when I try to start Xubuntu:\nstartind anachronistic crom\nstopping anachronistic crom\nchecking battery state\nstopping system V runlevel compatibility\nstarting\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Try this.

This can be done using:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\n\nA: This problem was fixed by marking a bunch of unneeded linux-headers versions for removal and installing the most current one.\n", "Q: How to install skype in Ubuntu 13.10? I have trouble installing skype in Ubuntu 13.10. Installing skype through the Software Center gives an error\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nand after removing skype by using sudo apt-get remove skype I tried to install skype with \nsudo apt-get install skype\n\nwhich gives an error \nE: Package 'skype:i386' has no installation candidate\n\nAny ideas how I can install skype?\n\nA: Download the deb file for ubuntu 12.04  from this link\nDownload Skype on your computer - Windows, Mac, and Linux - Get Skype\nThen issue dpkg command to install\nsudo dpkg -i skype-ubuntu-precise_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\n\nyou may miss some dependencies so issue this command\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\nA: Firstly check whether Canonical Partners is ticked in Software Sources. If no, check it and update.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen you can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install skype\n\n\nA: open your terminal and do as I mention\nwget http://download.skype.com/linux/skype-ubuntu-precise_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i skype-ubuntu-precise_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\n\nthats it, It will install skype in your Ubuntu.\ndon't worry about bit version.\n\nA: Install with:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f install\nwget -O skype-install.deb https://get.skype.com/go/getskype-linux-deb\nsudo dpkg -i skype-install.deb\n\nIf you get an error:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture amd64\n\n", "Q: SAMBA -- Cannot access Samba share from XP Cannot access SAMBA share on Ubuntu 12.04 box from XP box.\nSAMBA is up and running on the Ubuntu box. smb.conf has the correct windows workgroup name in it, and I can see the Ubuntu box from the XP machine. \nOn the Ubuntu box, I have set up a UNIX username CCD1 with a password for the purposes of sharing. I have added a Samba username in Samba Server Configuration of UNIX name: ccd1, Windows Username: Mike (username on the XP box), and put in password (same as used for the UNIX username). \nI have given access to the Samba shared folder for this username. \nOn the XP box I can browse the Network Neighborhood, drill down to the workgroup shares and see the Ubuntu box. I can see the shared folder on the Ubuntu box. It is also sharing printers. I can access the printers, I cannot access the shared folder. \nHere is how /etc/samba/smb.conf lists the two shares:\n[PRINT$]\n  comment = all printers\n  browseable = no\n  path = var/spool/samba\n  printable = yes\n; guest ok = no\n; read only = yes\n  create mask = 6766\n\n[CCD_Staff_Dailies]\n  comment = Shared Folder\n  path = /media/HDD 1/CCD/CCD_Staff_Dailies\n  writeable = yes\n; browseable = yes\n  valid users = sysadmin, ccd1\n\nIf I attempt to view the contents of the shared folder from the XP box it doesn't ask for my credentials, I just get: \n\n\\Ccd-files-linux\\CCD_Staff_Dailies is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. Access is denied.\"\n\n\nA: For me it works:\nEdit /etc/samba/smb.cfg.\nAdd the following at beginning (global):\nserver min protocol = NT1\nlanman auth = yes\nntlm auth = yes\n\nNT1 is a old version of security: SMBv1... necessary for Windows XP!\nThe other 2 lines is necessary to make logon, if not, you cannot make login.\n\nA: I just want to get into a public record that nowadays you need to add these configurations into the [Global] section of /etc/samba/smb.conf to make Windows XP able to connect to your Samba 4.5 server:\nserver max protocol = NT1\nlanman auth = yes\nntlm auth = yes\n\nOf course that compromises the security on some level I am deliberately unaware of.\n\nA: Just to update on the answer from @loop. I'd recommend using min protocol = NT1 instead of server max protocol = NT1 to allow other clients to use the more up-to-date and secure versions of SMB.\n", "Q: rescue data from corupted HDD I have Ubuntu server with 3 x 1.5TB SATA2 on Software RAID5 and LVM, it runs as VPS Node.\nThis morning guy from datacenter sent me mail that sda is corrupted and it needs to be changed...\nSo he change it and found out that sdc is also corrupted, and I demanded that he returns old sda so that I could try to restore some files.\nI installed grub-install on sdb but it's unconfigured, and on sdb1 there is only \"lost+found\" (I mount it in live rescue system and checked), and that is only partition that I can mount, as you can see in following (+ fsck):\n     root@rescue ~ # ll /mnt/\n    total 0\n    root@rescue ~ # cd /mnt/\n    root@rescue /mnt # mkdir sda sda1 sda2 sdb sdb1 sdb2 sdc\n    root@rescue /mnt # mount /dev/sda /mnt/sda\n    mount: /dev/sda already mounted or /mnt/sda busy\n    root@rescue /mnt # mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1\n    mount: unknown filesystem type 'linux_raid_member'\n    root@rescue /mnt # mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2\n    mount: unknown filesystem type 'linux_raid_member'\n    root@rescue /mnt # mount /dev/sdb /mnt/sdb\n    mount: you must specify the filesystem type\n    root@rescue /mnt # mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1\n    root@rescue /mnt # mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/sdb2\n    mount: you must specify the filesystem type\n    root@rescue /mnt # mount /dev/sdc /mnt/sdc\n\n    mount: you must specify the filesystem type\n    root@rescue /mnt # \n    root@rescue /mnt # df -h\n    Filesystem          Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n    rootfs               12G  1.6M   12G   1% /\n    udev                 12G     0   12G   0% /dev\n    188.40.24.212:/nfs  1.4T  592G  722G  46% /root/.oldroot/nfs\n    aufs                 12G  1.6M   12G   1% /\n    tmpfs               2.4G  288K  2.4G   1% /run\n    tmpfs               5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\n    tmpfs               4.8G     0  4.8G   0% /run/shm\n    /dev/sdb1           492M  2.9M  453M   1% /mnt/sdb1\n    root@rescue /mnt # fsck /dev/sda\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)\n/dev/sda is in use.\ne2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.\n\n\nroot@rescue /mnt # fsck /dev/sda1\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\nfsck: fsck.linux_raid_member: not found\nfsck: error 2 while executing fsck.linux_raid_member for /dev/sda1\nroot@rescue /mnt # fsck /dev/sda2\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\nfsck: fsck.linux_raid_member: not found\nfsck: error 2 while executing fsck.linux_raid_member for /dev/sda2\nroot@rescue /mnt # fsck /dev/sdc\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\n^C\ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)\nfsck.ext2: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while trying to open /dev/sdc\nCould this be a zero-length partition?\nroot@rescue /mnt # \nroot@rescue /mnt # fsck /dev/sdb\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)\n/dev/sdb is in use.\ne2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.\n\n\nroot@rescue /mnt # fsck /dev/sdb1\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)\n/dev/sdb1 is mounted.\ne2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.\n\n\nroot@rescue /mnt # fsck /dev/sdb2\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)\next2fs_open2: Bad magic number in super-block\nfsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...\nfsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdb2\n\nThe superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2\nfilesystem.

From what ive been able to understand so far with my limited knowledge of this situation is i need to install ubuntu on a thumbdrive since i dont have a disk, but from there i have no idea how to access it from the thumbdrive and fix this problem.

Once you do, look for \"Terminal\" application & execute the following commands from the command line:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nNone of the above can damage data on your Windows partition.\n", "Q: SSD Randomly Filling up.

I've installed a lot of different SSDs in various systems but only one does make this type of problem, a OCZ Agility 2 with Sandforce controller. Your problem is very likely to be hardware related. One solution could be to update your SSD firmware, but this comes with the not so unlikely risk to lose all your data, that's why i haven't done it.

I just ripped a full (all 74 minutes used) Music CD-R to six .flac files, one for each track. In total, the files add up to 262.1 MB. I thought a CD was supposed to hold 700 MB. Where did the other 440 MB go?\n\nA: It depends on several factors. \"The audio contained in a CD-DA consists of two-channel signed 16-bit Linear PCM sampled at 44,100 Hz.\" This means 176400 bytes/second (2 bytes per channel, times 2 channels, times 44100 samples/second).\nBy definition a CD-DA should fit 74 minutes of audio at this sampling rate, meaning (176400 * 60 * 74) = 783,216,000 bytes, or 746.93 MiB.\nNow, please notice that this is simply raw, sampled audio with no compression whatsoever.\nSo assuming you were to rip a CD with an actual play time of exactly 74 minutes, to an equivalently-raw format such as WAV or AIFF, you would get close to those 746 MB of information.\nYour data is smaller due to two factors.\nFirst, your disc may not be entirely full. Many CDs simply don't contain all possible 74 minutes of information. To put an example, The Beatles' Rubber Soul contains only 36 minutes of music, so it would contain less information.\nSecond, and perhaps most important, FLAC may be a lossless format, but it's not compressionless. To quote Wikipedia:\n\n\"FLAC (/ˈflæk/; Free Lossless Audio Codec) is a codec\n  (compressor-decompressor or coder-decoder) which allows digital audio\n  to be losslessly compressed such that file size is reduced without any\n  information being lost. Digital audio compressed by FLAC's algorithm\n  can typically be reduced to 50–60% of its original size\"\n\nSo if you assume that your 262 MB of audio are compressed by 50%, you'd come up with 520 MB of raw, uncompressed audio, which translates to a play time of about 55 minutes.\nAdd up the runtime of your tracks and I'm pretty sure it'll be close to this figure.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_Digital_Audio#Storage_capacity_and_playing_time\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_Soul\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC#Compression_levels\n\nA: CD-R discs do have a capacity of 737,280,000 bytes (700 MB), if they're not defective.  But, a music CD can be made with less than the maximum capacity, so if the flac files add up to less than 700MB, that might not be a problem.\n\nA: .flac is a lossless compression format. It compresses the files so that they become smaller in size. That's why the total is less than 700MB.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server install via USB.

I only get the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Test Memory\n\n*Boot from first hard disk\n\n*Rescue a broken system\n\n\nIf I burn the iso to a CD and boot via an external USB CD drive the following menu options are available:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu Server\n\n*Multiple server Install with MAAAS\n\n*Check disk for defects\n\n*Test Memory\n\n*Boot from first hard disk\n\n*Rescue a broken system\n\n\nIs this a problem with the Ubuntu Server .iso file or with Universal USB Installer?\nMy motherboard is an ASROCK Z87 Extreme6 in case it's an issue with my chipset.\n\nA: I've just experienced the same exact issue.  I also used ubuntu-13.10-server-amd64.iso and Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.4.8.exe.  I'm using a 1GB flash drive that also worked fine with the ubuntu-13.10-desktop-i386.iso installer. \nTurns out UUI 1.9.4.9 was released on 20-Nov-2013, with \"Fix broken Ubuntu Server options.\" in the changelog, so that answers your question of where the problem lies.  I just downloaded Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.5.0.exe and it worked like a charm.\n\nA: Likely, it's the flash drive, and certainly not the motherboard. If you get so far along as to reach the GRUB2 screen to show you choices, then the motherboard is capable of booting from a USB FlashDrive and configured to permit same. Therefore, I'd reformat the flashdrive before retrying. - and how big is that flashdrive?\n", "Q: kUbuntu kickstarter transparency I have a problem on Kubuntu, the kick-starter (start menu thing) was transparent till today, now its not transparent anymore, and I didn't change any settings or so, all my theme things are like before (transparent windows and so on) just the kick-starter is not transparent anymore. How can I get the transparency back? I am on an Acer C7 notebook.\nI have another PC running ubuntu and there the kickstarter is transparent (with the same theme) oxygen black I think it's called.\n\nA: There are a few things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the Kickstarter menu from the panel and add it again. Do this by right-clicking on the icon and selecting \"Remove this Application Launcher\" then right-click on the panel, go to Panel Settings > Add Widget, and drag \"Application Launcher\" to where you normally keep it.\n\n*Reload the theme. Open System Settings and go to Workspace Appearance and Behavior > Workspace Appearance > Desktop Theme. Select a different theme and hit apply. Once it is done, select the theme you want and apply it again.\n\n*Sometimes it's just an issue with plasma. You can restart it by striking alt-f2 and typing the following:\nkquitapp plasma-desktop && sleep 2 && plasma-desktop\nPlease note that this method could potentially cause other issues. If this doesn't work, you can also try logging out and logging back in again.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to disable screen lock timeout from a script? I'm looking for a way to disable screen dimming and desktop locking timeout from a bash script on Ubuntu 13.10. The script should be run when user logs in (configured in Startup Applications window) or as a service before lightdm (from init.d).\nI have found this answer and tried the command:\ngconftool-2 -s /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled --type bool false\n\nIt has actually changed that setting (I've checked with gconftool-2 -g and gconf-editor), but it doesn't seem to work like expected. Settings window still states that screen will turn off, and in fact, after 5 minutes screen turns off and I'm prompted to enter my password when I wake it up.\nI've also tried looking around in gconf-editor, but I haven't found any settings that looked relevant.\nSo, how can I disable desktop locking and screen off timeout from a script?\n\nA: Partial answer (I didn't try to change configuration) \nI think that new Ubuntu(s) use dconf and not gconf --- try to look for parameters in dconf-editor (settable via command line with the confusing-named gsettings). \nI think that the relevant schemas are around org.gnome.desktop.screensaver, at least for gnome. I do not have Unity installed so I think you need to research a bit around to adapt... \n\nA: Here's the solution I've confirmed to work based on @Rmano's answer:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/idle-activation-enabled false\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-enabled false\n\nAfter executing any of those you should see settings changing immediately in dconf-editor, Settings center will reflect changes too. Finally, settings will be immediately applied, so you can wait given period of time and see that the screen saver won't turn on.\n", "Q: How do I apply my mouse settings globally? I have tweaked my mouse sensitivity to be just right, and swapped the mouse buttons since I use it left-handed. This was done using the user \"Mouse & Touchpad\" settings in Gnome.\nI'd like this to apply to the login screen and all other user sessions (since they're all mine as well anyway). I'm using Gnome 3.8 under 13.10, but other sessions might use Unity or XFCE.\nHow do I apply my session mouse settings globally?\n\nA: There's no central place to apply mouse settings globally.\nWhy?\nlet's review how a user session starts in a X window environment(GNOME, KDE, XFCE,etc.).  \n\n\n*\n\n*a display manager starts X server which read its configuration file xorg.conf and shows a login window (typically created by an independent greeter program). so the only way to change mouse settings at the moment is through xorg.conf.\n\n*after you login, a session manager starts a settings daemon which re-applies the settings it stored, which can overwrite those settings in xorg.conf. for different desktop environment, the settings daemons are different and they have no responsiblity to respect each other's settings. normaly, there's a GUI frontend for each settings daemon.\na clarification on the settings daemon. in GNOME, it's gnome-settings-daemon while in XFCE it's xfsettingsd. In Unity it's gnome-settings-daemon because Ubuntu reuses most of the GNOME stack.\nBack to your requirements.  \n\n\n*\n\n*apply to the login screen\nthe only way to achieve this is through xorg.conf. because the settings-daemon is not started at the time.\nto change the mouse to be left handed, refer to how can I configure a specific usb mouse model as left-handed?\nto change the mouse acceleration, refer to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mouse_acceleration\n\n*apply to all other user sessions\nthis is simple. all desktop environment have settings programs. change the mouse settings of every desktop environment to your desired value.\n", "Q: Problem Connecting to Wired Network I just installed Ubuntu Desktop on a brand new Dell computer that had windows installed on it.

Even though the gateway is pingable, I cannot ping the gateway.  \nCan anyone explain why I cannot get to the internet and provide a solution ?  \n\nA: The problem was that the driver it was trying to use was r8169 and it wasn't working. I had to blacklist that driver and install an older driver following this Ubuntu forum thread. Then I had to change the autorun file from 'sh' to 'bash'. The internet picked right up, I didn't even have to reboot.\nBasically what I needed to do was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading the older r8168 driver from RealTeks download page\n\n*Blacklisting r8169 in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file adding\nblacklist r8169 \n\n\n*Compile the downloaded driver by running autorun.sh file.\nRefer to the forum page for detail instruction.\n", "Q: Windows hangs at grub's purple screen when dual booting in legacy boot mode I just installed my new computer (Gainward Z87X-UD4H, i7-4770, no video card).

Create by following that post's guidelines the windows EFI files in a separate \"microsoft\" folder next to the \"ubuntu\" one.\nReboot, boot ubuntu normally, fire up boot-repair. Boot-repair will detect your new windows EFI files and proceed to add them to GRUB (the recommended settings option should suffice). If Boot-Repair asks if you want to back-up the windows EFI files, say yes.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to set LibreOffice to record and show changes by default? I would like to modify the default behavior of LibreOffice so that it records and shows changes that I make. Can I do that?\n\nA: Yes - but you need a macro to enable recording of changes by default. The following LibreOffice Basic code enables recording of changes (created using the macro recorder):\nsub record_changes\nrem ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nrem define variables\ndim document   as object\ndim dispatcher as object\nrem ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nrem get access to the document\ndocument   = ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame\ndispatcher = createUnoService(\"com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper\")\n\nrem ----------------------------------------------------------------------\ndim args1(0) as new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue\nargs1(0).Name = \"TrackChanges\"\nargs1(0).Value = true\n\ndispatcher.executeDispatch(document, \".uno:TrackChanges\", \"\", 0, args1())\n\nend sub\n\nTo make LibreOffice run that macro every time when a new Writer document is created, just assign that macro to the \"New Document\" event.\nEDIT:\nThis macros works only for LibreOffice Writer documents. To make it work with LO Calc instead, you will have to replace \"TrackChanges\" with \"TraceChangeMode\" in the macro code.\n", "Q: libc6:i386 : Depends: libgcc1:i386 but it is not going to be installed after upgrading to the newest version I can't start up my pc.

I've been trying to get used to working with the workspaces, but the fact that the programs I use in workspace1 is accessible from every other workspace using unity, annoys me.\nFor example, when some folder is opened in workspace1 and I'm trying to open the home folder in workspace2 by clicking \"Home Folder\" , it takes me to the opened folder in workspace1.\nHow can I make Unity independent of every workspace?\n\nA: The workspaces are a feature of the Unity desktop, hence there is not way to \"separate\" then from Unity(at least as far as I know).\nFor some applications (Pidgin and Libre Office, according to my quick tests) there can only be on instance running so clicking to the icon will take you back to the workspace where it is active.\nFor others, particularly for your mentioned concern --the home folder(Nautilus), if you right click the icon it will give you the option to Open a New Window, selecting this will open a new window in the current workspace and leave the windows in the other workspaces as they were(open to whatever location you left them at).\nNOTE, however that if you right click the icon on any workspace and click \"Quit\" it will close all open windows on all workspaces.\nI'm not sure all or the  other programs can be opened on multiple workspaces simultaneously, but Firefox(and I assume most other browsers) can.  (I would assume that any programs that shows the option to open a new window can be opened this way but I don't know that for sure.)  \nI know this didn't directly answer your question on how because I'm pretty sure it's not possible, but I hope it was useful in a \"no but you can do this instead\" kind of way.\n\nA: If you middle click on a starter item Unity will try to start a new instance of that application instead of switching to an already open window. \nFor applications that can't have more than one instance running at a time this may not work.

Okay, so I'm really stuck on this one. So yesterday wile I was playing Kerbal Space Program, the game crashed, so I did a hard shutdown (holding the power button). When I turned it on, it booted just fine to the login screen, but when I went to click login, it gives me an error message, saying that \"could not write bites: broken pipes\" and goes back to the login screen. So I tried going on to the guest account, and that did work, so its just my account...

The basic steps are\n\n\n*\n\n*install the fuseext2 package (which should be available from the 'universe' repository)\n\n*mount the volume containing the ext3 filesystem using fuseext2\nSince you are trying to mount an LVM logical volume rather than a plain block device the format of the fuseext2 command should be something like\nfuseext2 -o ro,allow_other /dev/c/c /mnt/fcroot\nwhere /dev/c/c is the /dev/vg/lv block device name of your volume. When you are done, you can cleanly unmount the filesystem using\nfusermount -u /mnt/fcroot\nCurrently this workaround only supports read-only access. There were some search results suggesting that newer 3.x Linux kernels have native support of ext3 block sizes above 4k, but I was not able to confirm that (or whether it helps in this situation, without accompanying changes in page size). \n", "Q: The cd dvd boot option isn't showing up in bios I am trying to dual boot ubuntu 13.10 but the option for it isn't in the bios. I did previously install ubuntu on my computer and tried to delete it but it didnt work. What do i do?\n\nA: If you mean option for DVD player in bios, I would say the bios couldn't see DVD player, you can check hardware connection or try UEFI bios if you have this function on your bios.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong. Thanks.\n\nA: You can also prepare an Ubuntu live USB for installing Ubuntu and boot from that. You will need a USB flash drive that is 2GB or larger. For Ubuntu 18.04 and later the USB flash drive should be 4GB or larger. In the BIOS menu, you need to change the boot order so that the USB flash drive, which is usually called USB-HDD in newer computers, is the first entry in the boot sequence, and then save your new BIOS settings and exit the BIOS setup.\nThe instructions for preparing an Ubuntu live USB on Windows are found at the official Ubuntu How to create a bootable USB stick... webpage (see the step-by-step instructions below). \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Rufus and select your USB stick in the Device dropdown menu.\n\n\n*Click the CD-ROM icon next to the FreeDOS dropdown menu, then find your downloaded Ubuntu ISO and click Open and then Start.\n\n\n*Click Yes when it asks to download Syslinux software.\n\n\n*Click OK to write in ISO Image mode.\n\n\n*Confirm that your USB stick is selected and then click OK to continue. It is very important to verify that the device that you are installing the Ubuntu live USB to is indeed your flash drive, so that you don't overwrite any of your system or personal files which may make your operating system unbootable.\n\n\n*When it is finished, just restart your computer and start using Ubuntu, or you can install Ubuntu.\n\n", "Q: How I can install Gimp 2.8 and Gimp 2.9 on the same computer? How I can install Gimp 2.8 and Gimp 2.9 on the same computer and work with both?\n\nA: You can always just build it from the git repo (git://git.gnome.org/gimp), but if you really want bleeding edge tech all the time rather than something stable and well-documented, you may want to try gentoo or arch.  Either way, you'd want branch master, so:\n$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/gimp\n$ cd gimp\n$ git checkout master\n\nand follow the instructions in INSTALL.  You can just run the binaries from their location in that folder, no need to actually 'install' them to the root bin and lib directories.\nIf you want two conflicting versions of the same software accessible to aptitude, though, you will have to do some mucking about with package building.\n", "Q: USB wifi Card AWUS036NHR-RTL8192cu : Card not blinks like normal I am using Ubuntu 13.10.

And if not, what are the correct command(s) for doing so? I understand that this won't clear out certain parts of my hard drive - I'm not looking for that. Just looking to make sure no more files exist on the file system under that directory and its respective trash can. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: That will work perfectly, but to prevent any problems, you should add -f too, as in this example:\n# rm -rf /home/exampleuser/*\n\n\nA: Yes!\nuse: \nrm -rf /home/myUser/* \nf stands for force so it will never ask you anything\nand r stands for recursive i.e. it will recursively delete every directory see \nman rm\nWith this command, you can clear all the data from user home directory as well as your trash (because trash is located at /home/user/.local/share/Trash)\nBut remember! This step cannot be undone it will delete all your data\n\nA: This answer has been fully tested on a real system, twice.\nHow to fully delete (or reset) your home dir at ~ (or /home/my_username), even while actively logged into that user\nThere's no teacher better than experience.\nWARNING WARNING WARNING: do not run any of the rm commands below unless you want to wipe your whole user home directory or system! This is to do a full user wipe and reset, if that is what you want. Also, UNPLUG ANY EXTERNAL DRIVES, AND UNMOUNT ANY MOUNTED DISKS IN YOUR HOME DIR, BEFORE RUNNING THE rm COMMAND OR ELSE THIR CONTENTS WILL BE DELETED TOO!\nNope! Doing the command you said will not work as desired. I literally just tried this for a user I wanted to reset. That's right. I actually ran it. rm -rf /home/my_username/* does not work, because the shell glob pattern * does not match hidden files and folders! That means it leaves in a ton of your data, including your trash can, which is at ~/.local/share/Trash. Hidden files and folders begin with a dot (.), and using the glob pattern /home/my_username/* leaves in all hidden files and folders immediately in your home dir.\nTherefore, do this instead:\nThe quick answer:\n# First, CLOSE ALL OPEN PROGRAMS, such as Chrome, editors, etc.\n# Leave open only one terminal to run the following commands in.\n\n# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n# WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING\n# - Do NOT accidentally run this on the wrong computer while testing!\n# - see the big warning above. \n# - UNPLUG ANY DRIVES FIRST! \n# - And UNMOUNT ANY MOUNTED DISKS IN YOUR HOME DIR FIRST!\n# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n# Delete your entire home folder (see warning at start of this answer).\nsudo rm -rf /home/my_username   # WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\n# WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\nNow, do some \"cleanup\" and recreate the home dir to \"reset\" it for the user:\n# Now, the following assumes you want to recreate an empty home dir now, and you\n# are already logged in under the username whose folder you just deleted\n# above.\n\n# recreate an empty home dir\nsudo mkdir /home/my_username\n# ensure your group name exists (wiping your home dir may have removed it I\n# think, as that seems to be what happened to me just now)\nsudo groupadd my_username\n# add your username back to this group\nsudo usermod -a -G my_username my_username\n\n# give your username ownership over the new, empty home dir\nsudo chown -R my_username:my_username /home/my_username\n# ensure everything looks right (you should see the user and group ownership\n# of your new home dir is 'my_username my_username')\nls -alF /home\n\n# (Optional, but recommended) restore Ubuntu's default `~/.bashrc` and\n# `~/.profile` type bash terminal configuration files\ncp /etc/skel/.bash_logout ~\ncp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~\ncp /etc/skel/.profile ~\n# Now re-source these files to refresh your terminal\n. ~/.profile\n\n# now check inside your home dir; you'll see Ubuntu automatically has already\n# recreated a ~/Desktop dir for you.\nls -alF ~\n\nNow you're done. If you left programs like Chrome open while you did this, Chrome would have kept running and may have already restored some of your user's files, so...close Chrome and start over if that's not what you want. From here on out, just opening programs will start recreating some of the deleted files and dirs for you again. Ex: open Chrome and you'll see no user is logged in anymore, but just opening the program recreates these dirs:\n/home/my_username/.cache\n/home/my_username/.config\n/home/my_username/.local\n\nNow log out, or restart your computer, and log back in and you'll see it's almost as though you had just created a new user.

While I have a fairly good idea of how my Windows setup will work (60gb C: drive, 200gb D: drive, etc.), the Unix/Linux directory structure is still very new to me and is making this process a little bit confusing. I know that it's possible (and common) to partition your \"/\" directory and \"home\" directory separately, and - as I understand it - the \"/\" partition is meant to contain system specific programs and data, while the \"home\" partition contains the programs and data of the various users.\nHowever, I've also heard that most (if not all) of the programs that you install from repositories using APT are installed into the \"/\" directory. As someone who works with music/art programs and plays games (which can take up a LOT of space), this leads me to believe that I'll need a large \"/\" partition!\nI've also read (from here: http://www.control-escape.com/linux/lx-partition.html) that the \"home\" directory is \"the place where all the user-specific files, your data in other words, are stored. It is roughly equivalent to the “My Documents” folder on a MS Windows desktop\". But, as I mentioned above, I intend to keep all of my non-OS-specific data (music, documents, videos, etc.) on my ~400gb shared partition, anyway. This really leads me to believe that I don't need a big home partition at all and that I should focus on partitioning as much space as possible for \"/\". And still, I've heard other people claim that you only need around 10gb of space for your root partition!? \nEdit: Also, I just found out that programs like Steam and Wine take up space inside the \"home\" directory.\nSo, what should I do? I basically have 60gb SSD and 200gb HDD space for holding nothing but Linux programs. All of my data will be going onto my 400gb shared NTFS partition, so is it even worth making separate partitions for \"/\" and \"home\"? If I install both root and home on my 60gb SSD, how can I also use the extra 200gb of HDD space for more Linux programs? Can I expand root across multiple drives somehow, or maybe have a symlink or something that connects the two drives together?\nAs I said before, I'm still a major Linux newbie, so there may be something that I've completely misunderstood or overlooked. As someone who does a lot of art/music creation and gaming on my PC, I tend to use up a lot of program space quite quickly, especially since games and music libraries just keep getting bigger and bigger every year! Thanks for the help, I'm looking forward to learning more about Linux! :]\n\nA: Partitioning and deciding where to put things is more an art than a science... so I can give you some advice that is more personal than technical. \n1) keep / and /home separated. This will allow you to reinstall another kind of Linux (or Ubuntu) without touching your data and configuration. I have even been able to have two different Linux (Ubuntu and Mandriva, ages ago) running with the same /home directory and the same desktop configuration... it's really useful for experimenting. \n2) Now, 60GB for \"/\" is quite a big partition for Linux. In my laptop I have installed all possible photo manipulation systems, various video encoders, various games, and it is like this: \n(0)samsung-romano:~% df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1        88G  9.5G   74G  12% /\n\nBut yes --- in your case I would put / on the SSD (maybe with a 2*RAM swap, although this is much debated), and /home on the HD.  \nAnother option (will require more work but is more flexible) could be install a 20G root, 2G swap, and the rest /home on the SSD, and the 200G HD under for example /data. After install, you can change ownership of /data to you main user, and move there (and symlink back) the directories that grows too much. (A kind of poor-man LVM). This will have the advantage that the base system will be really snappy, being installed completely on the SSD. \nA final option is what I call the \"fiddler\" option. You can have a number of partition (suppose three - YMMV) of about 30G --- call them p1, p2, p3; and the rest in a very big partition, mounted under /data and chowned to your user. You can have an additional swap partition if you want. \nNow you can install your Ubuntu in p1, installing ALL under / in this one. Then you can symlink your personal files (documents, pictures, etc) to folders in /data. \nThis will permit you to install for example Ubuntu LTS on p1, the latest beta on p2, another distro on p3 --- each one with its home and configuration files, but you can share your data between all of them... \nThe ideal solution would be using a dynamic partitioning thing like LVM, but it's quite complex... This will be very useful when you'll decide to wipe Windows and use just Ubuntu ;-).\nAdditional info: where do \"programs\" go? \n\n\n*\n\n*root partition: here (in /, /usr, /usr/share/ etc.) all the software from the distribution (official repositories and PPA ones) will go. Notice that the old division between / and /usr is now practically unused in modern Unix installation(1).\n\n*home partition: here you will find all your data, or software installed as a normal user (not system-wide). This include, for example, \"bottles\" of wine (so all the software installed under wine will be in /home, virtual machines from VirtualBox, games from CrossOver, etc. In my experience is the part of the system that really need space.\n\n*/usr/local and/or /opt: this is the place where programs that you want to compile yourself normally place themselves. You may need this because the program is too new or too old to be in the repository, for developing, or for just playing. I had there my old copy of CivCTP... I usually move these directories under /home to make it impervious to system (re)install.\n\n*big games: I have no idea. My biggest game ever was CivCTP and it stayed in less than half a GB (it installed under my home or in /usr/local). \n(1)  Historically(2), when disk space was expensive, we had a / partition with the minimum to boot the system (/, /bin, /sbin, /etc, /lib, /var, /tmp) in a standalone way. In this partition went the minimum software and all the directories where the system could need to write. Under /usr existed a similar scheme with all the software; /usr was normally shared and mounted read-only by a cluster of machines, in order to save disk space.\n(2) I am speaking early 90s here. 100MB disk was a big server. \n\nA: I would argue for a single / partition in the SSD (60GB, as you have envisioned) to keep everything Ubuntu, including the /home folder. \nA separate /home partition is useful:\n(1) when one plans to try out different distributions of Linux (also known as \"distros\") \nor \n(2) when one may want to re-install Ubuntu without destroying the personal files and settings in /home.\nThe second reason is a bit less important now, as newer versions of Ubuntu installation process will detect existing Ubuntu and offer to preserve the /home folder when installing over.\nOn the other hand, if you keep /home as a folder of / you won't have to worry about how much to allocate to / and how much to allocate to /home. If your program files (games) take some more space, all you have to do is move your personal data to the HDD.\nBy now you must be thinking why not put /home in the HDD?\nThe only reason I prefer /home to be in the SDD is because /home stores not only your personal data, but it also stores your personal settings for all programs. This includes changes you make to the desktop or any other program settings, your browser bookmarks, etc. When you load a program from SSD but the personal settings are in HDD, it slows loading that program a tiny bit. Keeping / and /home both in the SSD will get you the fastest load time.\nKeep large data such as music, video, saved games, etc. in the HDD\nThe folders that contain large amount of data, such as Video, can be in the NTFS partition with symbolic links to /home. This is explained in some detail at: Windows Ubuntu dual boot - Share files between OS\nOther large sub-folders of /home can be partitions in the HDD. For example, if you install a lot of Windows programs and games in WINE, the hidden folder .wine will grow large. You can create an ext4 partition in the HDD and mount it at /home/[your user name]/.wine (Unlike Windows, a partition in Linux can be mounted as a sub-folder.) Steam games take up a lot of space. Your steam games are in /home/[your user name]/.local/share/Steam. See where are Steam games installed?  You can create a separate Steam (ext4) partition in the HDD if you want. These will require a one-time edit of the file /etc/fstab. See Mount a partition on login? for more on how to mount a partition at login.\nThe reason I recommend .wine to be an ext4 partition rather than a folder in the NTFS partition is because NTFS cannot preserve ownership and file permissions used by Ubuntu that is needed by the settings and other files stored in the .wine folder by WINE.\nBetween system linked folders in the NTFS partition and ext4 partitions mounted as sub-folders of /home you can keep all the large files in the HDD while keeping the system fast, taking advantage of the SSD.\nIf you still run out of space in the / partition in SSD due to large games and other programs, you can create an ext4 partition and move /usr there. However, this will require some planning, careful thoughts and execution. Ask a separate question if and when you need to go on that route.\nAs far as installing programs in / versus the /home see this excellent explanation of the process and its limitations: Software installed on root partition or on home partition In short, programs installed via the Ubuntu Software Center, or the command apt-get will be installed in /. Only \"static-binary\" compiled programs may be installed (rather copied) in sub-folders of /home and expected to work.\nMore references:\nPartitions for Ubuntu and Windows 7 dual boot on SSD + HDD setup\nSetup for dual disk (SSD+HDD) with /home partition\nDo I need Intel Smart Response when installing Ubuntu?\nMove or Install Apps on HDD not SSD\n", "Q: World of Warcraft Stopped Downloading Ubuntu 13.10 I found out how to get WoW running on Ubuntu using Wine 1.5 and am able to play it (albeit somewhat slow, but that's mostly due to my hardware).

(As well as which version is installed, what the latest version available is, and a description of each package.)\nAs for whether or not the PPA is trusted seems to be based on the user. I tend to search around to determine how many complaints a particular PPA has, as well as reviews on compatibility; or whether or not the package has been added officially.\nMore information pertaining to repositories, as well as various labels given to them, can be found here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\nAnd another question on AskUbuntu, offers a more colloquial explanation here:\nAre PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n\nA: In old Ubuntu versions, they were all in /etc/apt/sources.list file.\nIn recent Ubuntu, system repositories are y in /etc/apt/sources.list file and user installed PPA are inside the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory\n\nA: If you want a GUI to manage PPAs, there is Y PPA Manager.\n", "Q: Does the terminal store data? This is something that I have wanted to know for a really long time,  but never came around to actually posing a question. \nI know that in the terminal that is provided in Linux distros, the entire history of commands can be seen by using the arrow keys (if there is any other method, I'm not aware of it), so how does this happen?\nIs there someplace where the terminal logs all the keystrokes? Is it some sort of buffer? But, then again, if it was a buffer, it would be cleared out after a while, would it not? \nHow does this system work?\n\nA: Command history is generally stored on per-user basis in the .bash_history file in your home directory. Means, every user has its own set of commands he has executed.\nWhen multiple terminal sessions are open they may show you different commands when pressing the arrow key, but when you will close all the terminal windows the history from different terminal session will be merged to a common ~/.bash_history file.\n\nA: This is the command history and it is a feature of the shell rather than the terminal. \nOn Ubuntu (and a lot if not most of the other Linux distributions) the default shell for interactive use is Bash (/bin/bash). Bash keeps your history, that is a list of the last commands at ~/.bash_history. When you open a shell (usually by opening a terminal) this file is read and loaded into the internal history of this shell. Once you close the shell, the changes are written back to the file. By default this is limited to the last 500 commands.\nThere are a few variables and shell options that can change the behaviour of how this works exactly. Have a look at the bash manpage (man bash) if you want to know more. Just search for HISTORY (type /^HISTORY and confirm with Enter, jump to next find with n)\nAlso there are quite a lot more methods to go around the history than just Up and Down:\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, press Ctrl+R and part of a previous command, bash will search backwards in the history for a matching command, repeat pressing Ctrl+R if the first match is not the one you are looking for. (See 'Commands for Manipulating the History' in the bash manpage)\n\n*Copy /etc/inputrc to ~/.inputrc and uncomment the lines with history-search-forward and history-search-backward in them. If you type the first letters of a command and press PgUp, bash will show only commands from the history that start with the same letters. (Work only in shells opened after this change was made)\n\n*Type !! instead of a command on the shell, this will repeat the last command (see 'HISTORY EXPANSION' in the bash manpage for more information on that). \n", "Q: 920828 - how to open and build a VS2010 solution in precise?

If you're just using the computer for it's word processing capabilities, you might be able to go for significant periods of time without reading or writing to the hard disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable filesystem journaling. This is one of the most frequent uses of the hard drive. It will also allow the next item to be much more effective.\n\n*Use buffered disk writes. It's possible to buffer disk writes for a significant period of time before writing them to the hard disk. If you're only running one program, this could potentially allow your hard disk to remove off for 20 or 30 minutes even if you're writing to the device. I use laptop-mode-tools. I don't know the ubuntu approved method for this.\n\n*Other hard disk power saving options. (Spindown more often, etc.)\n\n*As mentioned previously, use powertop to find other configuration\nchanges that can be made to reduce power consumption.\n\n*Undervolt your CPU.

That's the lowest cpu clock, and uses the least power.\nuser@host:~$ for x in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo powersave > $x; done\n\nTo see which governor is currently active type:\nuser@host:~$ echo $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor)\npowersave powersave powersave powersave\n\nDefault value is \"ondemand\".\nEDIT:\nWhen you boot you can set the number of max cpus in the grub entry by pressing e to edit the entry and add:\nmaxcpus=1\n\nAfter changing the entry press F10 to boot.\nBUT, you can limit your cpu cores, but that does not mean that you use less power consumption, than before. Note, that when the system is able to efficiently use multiple cpus, it needs for the same task less time and produces less heat, so you have to test it for your purposes. For more info cf. the kernel parameters.\n\nA: you can use a tool named as pm-powersave.

Anything running a timed loop will cause the processor to wake up from sleep and use a little extra power.\n\nA: \nShould install a more lightweight desktop environment?\n\nHow about 0 GUI's.

If there's another version, you can install it using apt-get install <package>=<version>, if that version does exist, e.g.:\napt-get install libjpeg8=8c-ubuntu9\n\nA: Since the OP may have actually had the end goal of checking/updating their version of ImageMagic, you may need to just check which version you're using.  In this case it's as simple as this\nconvert --version\n\nwill return something like:\nVersion: ImageMagick 6.9.10-23 Q16 x86_64 20190101 https://imagemagick.org\nCopyright: © 1999-2019 ImageMagick Studio LLC\nLicense: https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php\nFeatures: Cipher DPC Modules OpenMP \nDelegates (built-in): bzlib djvu fftw fontconfig freetype jbig jng jpeg lcms lqr ltdl lzma openexr pangocairo png tiff webp wmf x xml zlib\n\n", "Q: Python 3.2 script not working and/or importing tkinter when running from desktop I'm really puzzled by this, but the answer is probably quite simple and just can't see it: \nI have a series of python modules that work fine from within the python interpreter, but nothing happens when running from a GUI situation.

I hope this help you.\nPlease note that you may experience some issues when attempting to do certain things in some files or folders from the root directory if you don't give them the proper permissions but that's worth another question.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Sending a fax via a mobile connected via a USB cable I have a smartphone which I can connect through a USB (Universal Serial Bus) cable. I wish to send a fax to a given number. Which software in Ubuntu can I use to send the fax? \n\nA: Most mobile technologies cannot support faxing.

I've installed Ubuntu 13.10. I've installed grub-customizer and re-checked my installations of unity and grub-customizer. When I try and reinstall grub-customizer I get the message that \"grub-customizer is already the newest version\" But, when I click on unity and type\"grub\" all I can see is the file folder where grub is. In fact I can't find ANY apps with unity. I guess I have to repair unity? I tried to reinstall it but got the same message about \"unity-scope-home already being the newest version.\" How do I repair whatever is broken so I can launch grub?? Thanks\n\nA: The unity searchs apps from .desktop file created by the app during installation. Some time the app doesn't create such file. \njust logout and log back in..

In other words you need to know qwerty to reach the original contents of Dir.\n\nTo access from nautilus:\nNavigate to Dir. Press Ctrl+L. Type qwerty in the location bar to enter.\n\nChanging password:\ncd Dir\nmv qwerty newpassword\n\n\nThis method has quite a few issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*After gaining access the password will be clearly visible for all to see in the terminal prompt or nautilus address bar.\n\n*Scripts inside Dir which depend on their exact location in the filesystem won't work properly.\n\n*Most importantly, sys-admins will be able to access contents without the password -  this may not be desirable.\n\n\nApart from these there could be other security flaws: this was never intended to be an encryption scheme. That said, from the sound of the question, I guess this might be sufficient.\n\nA: The classic sg(1) utility may do what you want, even if the interface hasn't changed for decades, and is just a little more complicaded than what you asked for. what you do is create a special group with no users and a password (see group(5) and gshadow(5) for details), then you change the group of the folder to this new group and set the permissions for the folder to allow access by the group ( either 0770 or 0750 ) so that when your guest tries to cd into the folder, you get access denied. now you use sg to change your group to this new group you can now cd into the directory until you type exit to return to your previous permissions.\nProviding access to gui applications presents additional challenges, because sg was written long before X11.\n\nA: You are probably looking for gpgdir from the packet signing-party (standard ubuntu repository) which can encrypt directries recursively.\nThe manual page is here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/saucy/man1/gpgdir.1.html\n\nA: I am suprised nobody mentioned this solution with zip command, it doesn't requires any 3rd party package.\nzip -er Folder.zip Folder\nThis will encrypt your folder and will require the password everytime to open each file.\nHowever this wont hide the filename(s), but if you need stronger protection to filename then go for 7zip but thats not bundled in linux version particularly ubuntu or its variant(s).\n", "Q: Upgrading to Alpha fails due extras repositories I try to upgrade to the latest release of Ubuntu (14.04  - Alpha).\nI typed this in the Terminal:\n$ sudo update-manager -d\n\nAfter some checks, a popup appeared:\n\nI clicked the Upgrade... button:\n\nPreparing to upgrade was successful, but Setting new sofware channels fails:\n\nHow can this be fixed?\n\nA: Just disable the \"extra\" repositories. These packages still not have trusty counter part, since most of them are for Stable versions:\n\nTo disable the extras repositories, just remove all the extras entries from /etc/apt/sources.list file or use the software sources and untick the extras entries there.\nsudo sed -i '/extras\\.ubuntu\\.com/d' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n", "Q: How do I connect to the wifi in Ubuntu within my Virtual Machine? I have a virtual machine installed on my Windows 8.1 laptop with Ubuntu installed on it, but when I open the Network menu it doesn't show any wireless networks. How do I connect Ubuntu in my virtual machine to a wireless network that my host machine is detecting?\n\nA: What you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open virtual machine Settings-> Network, then choose adapter1 to NAT.\n\n*Now open Network and Sharing-Center in Windows, then go to change Adapter settings, then disable the virtual box host only adapter.\n\n*close the window and now you should be able to use internet in ubuntu.\n\n\nA: What you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings-Network, then choose adapter1 to NAT.\n\n*Open Network and Sharing-Center in Windows, then go to change Adapter settings, then disable the virtual box host only adapter.\n\n\nA: Is simple. You can't. Virtual machines can't expose the physical wireless cards. All of that is using a virtualization layer. What you can do is buying a USB dongle card instead.\n\nUnfortunately no virtualization software allows for direct access to\n  hardware devices like that. \nCompare VirtualBox with VMware Fusion and Parallels for Mac. All 3 of\n  those programs behave the same way. The only devices that can be\n  directly accessed are usb devices. Everything else is abstracted\n  though the virtualization engine. (Though you could argue that the vm\n  has lower level access to cd rom's and storage devices). \nI wish I could give you a better answer, than simply to buy a usb\n  wireless card. \nSome improvements have been made at the hardware level to support\n  hardware passthrough. For example, Intel has released processors that\n  have advanced virtualization features. You can in theory, connect\n  multiple video cards in your computer, and assign one of the video\n  cards to a Virtual Machine. That VM would then have full control over\n  the graphics card. \nIntel calls the technology VT-d\nhttp://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2009/06/25/understanding-vt-d-intel-virtualization-technology-for-directed-io\n\n(https://superuser.com/a/624806/235569)\n\nA: You can! I just did! If you use a USB ethernet stick. In VirtualBox, with the VM shut down, set the USB filter to include your USB wireless device. Then on VM startup it will be available only to your VM.

The setup runs smoothly overall except for when it comes to video and 3D performance in Ubuntu. I had the infamous flickering issue at one point and found a way to fix it. It has to do with the NVidia card going into low-power mode and then videos and 3D effects suffer from tearing and stuttering. The fix is to go to nvidia-settings and change the power-mode from 'Auto' to 'Prefer Maximum Performance'. The problem is this only works until I reboot. After the reboot the setting is cleared and the problems still persist, so I have to manually set it again for the current session. I tried gksu-ing and setting it, but it didn't work. I tried to edit the etc/X11/xorg.conf, but it's empty - there are zero lines in that file... I read all the related articles, but mainly people complain about brightness being reset or dual-monitor configs, which solutions involve some specific app that doesn't help me in any way.\nTL;DR: NVidia settings are reset after reboot and tried everything I could find on the Internet to no good.\nIf someone knows what to do in this situation, please share!\nThank you!\nEDIT [1]: I did some further digging and it seems there is no obvious or safe solution. Some people have tried to set the performance level manually, but report it's unsafe and may kill the GPU. \nThere is still hope though. I think this could be done through the NVidia profiles option provided from nvidia-settings. The problem is that one needs to know the key in question and the value this key accepts. \nI could have put a screenshot here, but I need rep => 10...\n\nI couldn't find a list of the possible keys nor any key values... No luck I guess. \nCan someone provide a link or list some useful ones?\nThanks!\nEDIT [2]: Finally! Thanks to everybody for the help! I found the solution with the help of vegard torvund and this thread. And thanks to the Ubuntu Google+ Community for spreading the word!\n\nA: What you can do is create a script like the following and run it on startup. \n#!/bin/bash\nnvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=<display_settings>\n\nYou replace <display_settings> with your display-settings. The display-settings could look like this:\n\"DVI-D-0: nvidia-auto-select +0+0, DP-0.1: nvidia-auto-select +1920+0, DP-0.8: nvidia-auto-select +0+0, HDMI-0: nvidia-auto-select +1920+0\" \n\nYou get the display settings out of the 'X Configuration File'.\nYou can run it on startup via the program 'Startup Applications Preferences'. \nYou can launch 'Startup Applications Preferences' via gnome-session-properties in the terminal.\n\nA: I was able to solve this problem on my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to \"nvidia-settings Configuration\" tab.\n\n*Uncheck \"Include X Display Names in the Config File\"\n\n*Save Current Configuration\n\n\nIt turns out the settings were getting loaded, but the display names (which looked right) were preventing them from being set. This was on a basic dual display system.\n\n\n\nA: On Linux Mint 18 Cinnamon go to the little config app named monitors. When pressing \"apply\" a file ~/.config/monitors.xml is saved which serves the same purpose than the xfce displays.xml - it saves all those settings, that in nvidia settings are not persistent. You have to play around to change something (to trigger the availability of the apply button) if you happen to have configured your display layout in NVIDIA graphic settings panel.\nI did this AND added the load-settings from above to xinitrc.\nI wil check if my window-reordering problem after the screen lock was active is gone now All windows reordered to main monitor\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a xorg.conf file by:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\n\n*Look for the Section \"Device\" part in the xorg.conf file\nAnd add this line inside the section:\nOption \"RegistryDwords\" \"PowerMizerEnable=0x1; PerfLevelSrc=0x3322\"\n\nSave and reboot your machine.\nPS. If you add more parameters, add ; after 0x3322\n\nA: From the official user guide: \n\"4.  Loading Settings Automatically\nThe NVIDIA X driver does not preserve values set with nvidia-settings\nbetween runs of the X server (or even between logging in and logging\nout of X, with xdm, gdm, or kdm).  This is intentional, because\ndifferent users may have different preferences, thus these settings\nare stored on a per user basis in a configuration file stored in\nthe user's home directory.\n\nThe configuration file is named \"~/.nvidia-settings-rc\".  You can\nspecify a different configuration file name with the \"--config\"\ncommandline option.\n\nAfter you have run nvidia-settings once and have generated a\nconfiguration file, you can then run:\n\n    nvidia-settings --load-config-only\n\nat any time in the future to upload these settings to the X\nserver again.  For example, you might place the above command in\nyour ~/.xinitrc file so that your settings are applied automatically\nwhen you log in to X.\n\nYour .xinitrc file, which controls what X applications should\nbe started when you log into X (or startx), might look something\nlike this:\n\n    nvidia-settings --load-config-only &\n    xterm &\n    evilwm\n\nor:\n\n    nvidia-settings --load-config-only &\n    gnome-session\n\nIf you do not already have an ~/.xinitrc file, then chances are that\nxinit is using a system-wide xinitrc file.  This system wide file\nis typically here:\n\n    /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n\nTo use it, but also have nvidia-settings upload your settings,\nyou could create an ~/.xinitrc with the contents:\n\n    nvidia-settings --load-config-only &\n    . /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n\nSystem administrators may choose to place the nvidia-settings load\ncommand directly in the system xinitrc script.\n\nPlease see the xinit(1) manpage for further details of configuring\nyour ~/.xinitrc file.\n\n\"\n\nA: The system doesn't rewrite parameters on reboot. In fact nvidia-settings is the one that does that. Open a Terminal and edit the \"Exec=\" line in nvidia-settings with this: \n\"optirun /usr/bin/nvidia-settings -c :8 --config=~/.nvidia-settings-rc\"\n\nwithout quotes if you use bumblebee, or if you don't, the command probably is:\n\"/usr/bin/nvidia-settings --config=~/.nvidia-settings-rc\".\n\nAlso before saving your settings uncheck: \"Include X Display Names in the Config File\".\nThe system holds your settings from one session to another but, in my case (Ubuntu Gnome 14.04.1 amd64) I have some errors about vdpau and prime. They may be normal considering that I don't use nvidia-prime. These errors could also make nvidia-settings to override the settings.\n\nA: If your are running a Gnome desktop (and I assume al Gnome based).\nLooks like Gnome always tries to put their config on top of the nvidia settings.\nI've tried this:\nhttps://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/persist-nvidia-x-server-settings/158102\nBasically having the display resolution configured from the nvidia-setting are constantly overwritten by Gnome's own config.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and I was experimenting with my video card and to tell you the thing I had similar problem that you had or have after restart my nvidia settings couldn't be applied and actually my xorg.conf file was empty too! But all of this happened when I downgraded my nvidia drivers and so after all of this problems what I did is ran a simple command in Terminal:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall nvidia-settings && sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings\ngksudo nvidia-settings\n\nOnly what I won't tell you if I did reboot my system or not after reinstalling, just don't remember but after this procedure I got everything working fine. I could access my nvidia settings and apply any stuff there like maximizer and so on, it also replaced my xorg.conf file with complete lines due to my hardware, it even recreates it when it's deleted or lost. But all of this I did at my own risk, maybe it depends on ones hardware.\n\nA: You need to run nvidia-settings as superuser so that you have rights to save the config file.\nopena terminal and type: sudo nvidia-settings\nmake your changes and save the config\nthis works for ubuntu 20.04\n\nA: Alt+F2 and on the command type gksu nvidia-settings\nSave X Configuration\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nA: I found a solution with Linux Mint 17.2; you have to edit the file /home/$user/.config/xfce4/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml.\nYou will see your displays in it and there you can set the X and Y axis of them; simply adjust them and it will stay each time when you reboot.\n\nA: For linux mint 18.2 menu > administration > x server settings.

Is this possible, and easily doable?\nThe main thing comes down to getting the bootloader to allow me easy swapping between OS's, and then getting windows to install programs and the like onto the 3TB drive instead of the SSD. How can I do this? \n\nA: Simply install Windows on the SSD and then install Ubuntu alongside Windows.   This will give you a dual-boot setup driven by a grub menu.  Both OS's will see your 3TB drive which will be available for data storage in either system.  With a 120 GB SSD, there should be no issues with having sufficient space available for program installation.

For example, this will simply print \"hello\" 3 times:\nfor i in Tom Dick Harry; do echo hello; done\nhello\nhello\nhello\n\nIf you want to actually do something to the elements of your list, you will need to refer to the variable you assigned them to:\n$ for i in Tom Dick Harry; do echo hello $i; done\nhello Tom\nhello Dick\nhello Harry\n\nSo, your loop was running mv ./* $CYCL which would have moved the contents of your current directory into whatever is the value of $CYCL.

Just open up Disk Utility, select your primary drive(the drive, not a partition), click the 'Partition' tab and you should be able to carve out a chunk of the drive by resizing the rectangle representing your disk space.

There are two options to fix the file system:\n\n*\n\n*-a: This will fix errors found automatically.\n\nAutomatically repair the filesystem without any questions (use this option with caution).  Note that  e2fsck(8) supports -a for backward compatibility only.  This option is mapped to e2fsck's -p option which is safe to use, unlike the -a option that some filesystem checkers support.\n\n\n\n*-r: This will ask before fixing errors.\n\nInteractively  repair the filesystem (ask for confirmations).  Note: It is generally a bad idea to use this option if multiple fsck's are being run  in  parallel.   Also  note  that  this  is e2fsck's default behavior; it supports this option for backward compatibility reasons only.\n\n\n\n*There's also -y but is not recommended:\n\nFor  some filesystem-specific checkers, the -y option will cause the fs-specific fsck to always attempt to fix any detected filesystem corruption automatically.  Sometimes an  expert  may  be able  to  do  better driving the fsck manually.  Note that not all filesystem-specific checkers implement this option.  In particular fsck.minix(8) and fsck.cramfs(8) do not  support  the  -y option as of this writing.\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What exactly does this error mean (I am looking for something more informative than it was expecting one number but found another)?\n\n\n*Is there any documentation that describes this specific error message?\n\nActually,  fsck is simply a front-end for the various filesystem checkers (fsck.fstype) available under Linux.  The filesystem-specific checker is searched for in /sbin  first,  then  in  /etc/fs  and /etc, and finally in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.  Please see the filesystem-specific checker manual pages for further details. So, for us to know, you have to tell us what filesystem are you checking.\n", "Q: How to install Gerix-Wifi-Cracker?

The hard disk is 250 gigs, and its about evenly split. Problem is, ubuntu 12.04 has maxed out it's half. So I'm wondering how or if I can just turn the 12.10 side of ubuntu into extra storage space for my working copy of 12.04?  Can I turn the other partition into basically a second drive letter?\n\nA: you can do that by using gparted partition manager.\nsudo apt-get install gaprted will install that if its not installed.\nThen open it.\nmake sure that those two partitions are unmount. If its not possible to unmount them then rub a live Ubuntu and open gparted over there.\n\n\n*\n\n*from which volume you would like to take the space use shrink option. so save some space from it. it will show you how much minimum you should keep and how much you can attain.\n\n*to which volume you would like to add the space you extend option.\n\n\nA: Linux doesn't use drive letters as in Windows, so you can't create a \"D: drive\" as you might under Windows. Instead, Linux uses a system in which filesystem partitions can be mounted more-or-less wherever you want in Linux's unified directory tree. Most user files go under /home, so if you're gobbling up disk space on videos, digital photos, MP3s, word processing documents, and the like, that's where they all live, and it's best to put extra space under /home, too.\nFor greatest long-term flexibility, my recommendation is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your /home data. (Always a good idea, especially before embarking on a major undertaking involving your user data.)\n\n*Turn the second partition into a /home partition, as described here.\n\n*Boot a Linux live CD (the Ubuntu installer in \"try it now\" mode or a live CD like Parted Magic or System Rescue CD).\n\n*Using GParted, resize both the partitions so that your working Ubuntu root (/) partition is about half full (typically, about 10-30GiB) and the rest of the space is given over to /home.\n\n\nThis will ensure that most of your disk space is available in /home, which is where it's most easily used. (This assumes a typical desktop Ubuntu installation. If you've got a server or something, your disk space might be consumed in /var or some location other than /home, in which case you'd want to use most or all of the disk space in that location instead of /home.)\nAlternatively, you could use mkfs or GParted to create a fresh filesystem on (\"format\") the spare partition, mount it somewhere within your user's home directory (temporarily via mount and in the long term by editing /etc/fstab), and copy some of your files there. For instance, if videos are chewing up, say, 70% of your disk space, you could create a ~/videos directory, mount the newly-emptied partition there, and copy your videos to that directory. This will be a bit quicker and safer in the short term than what I've described, but it's a less flexible arrangement in the long term. The problem is that either of your two partitions could fill up again, which would require manual juggling of files to balance the load across the partitions. If all your user space is in one partition, that's less likely to happen.\nA third option is to delete the partition that has the non-functional Ubuntu installation and resize the working one to fill the entire hard disk. This is likely to be quicker than the first option, and could be either quicker or more time-consuming than the second. Having a separate /home partition helps protect your user data, though, so IMHO it's worth going to the effort to have that, or at least to move some of your user data into a separate partition.\n", "Q: How do I encrypt my drive during installation? How do I encrypt my drive on ubuntu?

varient.\nYou'll likely need a gui, so you're best off going with one of the officially supported GUI variations, rather than server, or minimal. If you're a newbie, xubuntu and lubuntu might be good fits since they're both lightweight and are pretty simple to install. I generally wouldn't recommend the big two derivatives - ubuntu and kubuntu since both of them have composited desktops and other shiny things you don't need\nWith your specific use-case there's no compelling reason to go 64 bit, or to give your VM heaps of ram - most browsers are frustratingly 32 bit only\nTurbotax's desktop version may not work very well on linux under wine, though confusingly there's reports the online version works fine if you run the windows firefox version under wine.\n\nA: Unless TurboTax has a command line interface I'm not aware of, I believe you are going to need the desktop version, but that is not going to work if you're running VirtualBox on a server distro.   As for the architecture, 32 bit matches your host but either will work because this is a virtual machine.  If security is a big issue, choose your wireless router's password well, disable remote logins to the Host machine and restrict clients to the VM like you suggested. \n", "Q: User name and password changes After getting \"can not write bytes : broken pipe\" message and being unable to boot, I reloaded 12.04, my user name had some upper case letters in it and I was unable to log in.  Maybe the password changed also.  How can I log in and reset my password and user ID ?\n\nA: Assuming you have physical access you can boot into single user mode. In ubuntu, this is very conviniently called \"recovery mode\". If you lack this, go into edit mode in grub go to your user boot option and add the word single at the end\nThe 'proper' way to look up your username (and password, of sorts) is to look in /etc/shadow - cat /etc/shadow should spit out all that, and you'll see the usernames of all your accounts there.\nYou'll see something like geek:$fhgbesft7y842387ty884yg87.:16026:0:99999:7::: - First 'field' before the colon is your username, then a hash of a password (I've replaced mine with key mashing) and so on.

Remove the link and try again:\nsudo rm /usr/bin/utserver\nsudo ln -s /opt/utorrent-server-v3_0/utserver /usr/bin/utserver\n\n\nA: You can also tell ln to ignore already existing files and just overwrite them using the -f (or --force) option:\nsudo ln -sf /opt/utorrent-server-v3_0/utserver /usr/bin/utserver\n\nWarning!

If you go to the actual server you can see that it has created the symlink correctly.\nThe issue in this case is the symlink looks like a real file in the remote server which is not what ln expected so it reports an error. Possibly playing with the mount options on sshfs will show the symlinks correctly e.g. follow_symlinks, transform_symlinks, direct_io, etc\n", "Q: What is the current state of the planed features of Ubuntu-Touch I think that title explains everything.

I have set a password for admin during installing ubuntu but after that I had changed my admin account to standard account. After changed to standard account without any password. On installing any software or updation it asked for root password. On typing root password, it shows wrong password. and unable to authenticate my password. Is my root password which I set during installing ubuntu is changed?\n\nA: Ubuntu does not have password for root by default so you will never guess it.\nThe reasons for this are explained in my answer to this question:\nHow to enable root login? and there is more detail here: RootSudo Comunity Documentation.\nWhat you need to do to fix this is either give root a password which is not recommended practice, or make your self an administrator again.\nTo do this you will need to boot into a root shell as described here:\nHow do I boot into recovery mode?\nOnce in you can add yourself to the sudo group with \nusermod -aG sudo your_user\n\nReplace your_user with your user name.\nNext you need to set a password\nNow we can set the user's password with the passwd command. (In this example I will use your_user as the example, you need to substitute whatever the user's username is):\npasswd your_user\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nAgain replace your_user with your user name.\nReboot and you now have an administrator account so should be able to update.\nIf you don't want your account to be an administrator account you can create a new user instead that is but you will need to do that from recovery mode.  \n", "Q: On 13.10, wifi gets detected but unable to connect I am running Ubuntu 13.10, my system detects WiFi but I'm unable to connect.\nI am getting this error message:\nr[736]: (wlan0): supplicant interface state: authenticating -> disconnected \nr[736]: (wlan0): supplicant interface state: disconnected -> scanning 4.472788] ieee80211 phy0: \nrt2x00queue_write_tx_frame: Error - Arrived at non-free entry in the non-full queue 0 4.472788] \nPlease file bug report to http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com\n\nHow can I fix this ?\nWith the below reply by Pushpreet, Wifi is working, but still bluetooth never works, any suggestions? \n\nA: Taking a lot of assumptions here, because you haven't really given a lot of information, I think that your WiFi card is Ralink RT3290.\nI had the same problem and fought hard to fix this.\nThere are numerous fixes, I tried them, and none worked, finally found one which was the easiest and worked flawlessly, and yes, that involves upgrading your kernel.\nHere, this will help:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/377973/216304\n", "Q: Random warnings at startup When I reboot the system, sometimes I get the warning messages saying System problem detected.

What you are doing here is executing Thunderbird as root... you shouldn't! If you need to start a program when your system boots up, specially if they use GUI's, you should add them to the startup application list instead.

I was told that I plug in the USB into my computer before I start it up, it will go directly to Ubuntu, and when I unplug it after shutdown and start it up again it would go back to Windows 8. It does nothing just goes to Windows 8. I'm completely new to Windows 8 (literally got it today) so is it possible to use it like I said? If so how? Thanks\n\nA: There are two ways to do what you want.\nYou can either change the bios settings to always boot from the USB ( if it is available ), if it is not, then it will boot from the hard-drive.\nTo do this, go to the bios ( most probably by pressing the del key repeatedly after turning on your computer ), and then under the Boot menu, find an option which says boot device priority, and there, give the USB a higher priority than your hard-drive.\nOr, you can just go to the boot device options before booting and select your usb.\nFor this, after starting your computer, repeatedly press the key which takes you to the boot device options ( usually F8 or F12, it should be indicated on the first screen you see when you turn on your computer ), and there, select your USB.\n", "Q: Installing Nvidia 770 on ubuntu 13.10 I can't get my brand new NVIDIA 770 working on my ubuntu 13.10,\n I had it working perfectly on my 13.04 until my HDD crashed. \nNow it wont work under my 13.04 liveCD or when I upgrade to 13.10. \nI need to connect it to my built in Intel HD4000\nHow do I get the drivers to have the correct resolution, when I use it on my Hisense monitor.\nAnd how do I safely and properly install my NVIDIA drivers, because each time it fails so I reformat the HDD and try again.\nThank you so much guys.\n\nA: ok, sounds like you might need \"bumblebee\" https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee   also check this link  http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html\nEither use Nvidia or Nouveau though, not both. With bumblebee you have the choice of switching back and forth between both your gfx cards.  :)\nAlso for Linux, make sure in the BIOS you have disabled UEFI and secure boot/fast boot.

I upgraded from Ubuntu 12.10 to Ubuntu 13.10.\nAfter some time, I found that I didn't export all my MySQL databases. Some of them are missing. I still have a backup from my /var/ partition, but I cannot just copy the missing databases (directories) over from /var/lib/mysql/, it will not work. MySQL-daemon will fail to restart.\nI cannot replace the entire current /var/lib/mysql/ with the backed-up one either, just so I could export the missing tables and move the new directory back and import the exported tables. The databases and tables did show up in phpMyAdmin, but all the content was empty.\nThe annoying thing is, the daemon will fail to restart after fiddling around quickly. MySQL has turned * into a sensitive little girl. when I move an exact copy of my (new, untouched and post-upgrade) mysql directory back, it still won't restart and I have to apt-get install mysql-server-5.5 --reinstall for it to work agian.\nSo, is there any way I can get a database back from backed up files? They are sitting there so conveniently, named exactly like the database, with files named exactly like the tables.\n*) This used to work. Normally I export my stuff, so last time I did this was a few years back, but it used to work. Now MySQL acts like a crybaby.

Maybe you have deleted and recreated InnoDB data\n  files but have forgotten to delete the corresponding .frm files\n  of InnoDB tables, or you have moved .frm files to another database?\n  or, the table contains indexes that this version of the engine\n  doesn't support.\n  See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-troubleshooting.html\n  how you can resolve the problem.\n\nAnd some other messages about InnoDB that I cannot reproduce because I accidentally refreshed the log in my editor while reinstalling mysql for the n-th time.\nWhat is this InnoDB stuff anyway? It's like the weak little crybaby brother or sister of the grown and versatile MySQL. They made it the default in server 5.5. Probably with good reason, but so far it didn't make me any sandwiches.\n\nA: InnoDB is a storage engine, just like MyISAM is.\nThe old method of copying files back still works with MyISAM databases, but InnoDB has some features (like adherence to ACID and finer locking controls) that come with the price of that no longer working.\nThis thread over on StackOverflow has some answers on how to restore an InnoDB database from files.\n", "Q: How to quickly open an application in Lubuntu?

OK!\n\nNote:\nYou may or may not need to update your initramfs, you should if\nany of the modules installed are part of your initramfs. To add\nsupport for your distribution to do this automatically send a\npatch against \"update-initramfs.sh\". If your distribution does not\nrequire this send a patch with the '/usr/bin/lsb_release -i -s'\n(\"Ubuntu\") tag for your distribution to avoid this warning.\n\nYour backported driver modules should be installed now.\nReboot.\n\n\nA: 'Can't read private key' may safely be ignored. The ending message was not 'abort' but, instead, 'Your backported driver modules should be installed now. Reboot.' I suggest you do so. Then check that the correct module is being used:\nmodinfo ath9k\n\nThe version should be:\nversion:        backported from Linux (v3.12-0-g5e01dc7) using backports v3.12-1-0-g9ae6b6c\n\nAnd your wireless should be working as expected.\n", "Q: Forms not working properly I am Website Designer. I created an input text box through Blue Fish HTML Editor. But when I previewed in Firefox it is showing overlapped to next column. But in windows same browser is showing correctly. I am using lower version of Firefox in windows. In other browsers like Google Chrome, Safari, Opera etc its alignment is not properly showing compared to that in windows.\nI connected a microphone on my system but it is not working but in windows it is working well. \nPlease give me a solution for this.\nRegards,\nRoney Wilson C\n\nA: That is a very vague issue you may need to include a snippet of your code to better illustrate the issue. It may just be that the box is drawn differently in the UI and you may just need to change the size. If you need 2 different sizes you would have to make a page for linux users and a page for windows users, or a redesign that accommodates both.\nAs for your microphone if it is a 3.5mm style you may need to configure the settings. By typing in the unity search box \"Sound\" and click Sound. In the sound settings under the input tab it should have your microphone input and the options. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 using Raid 1, Need a step by step guide Lately, I am trying to build a server that uses Ubuntu Server 12.04.3(64bit) . I am facing problem while wanting to install under a software RAID(RAID 1). My Server spec are as below:\nProccesor: Intel i5-4670\nMotherboard： Asus H87M-E V1\nRAM: 2X 4GB 1600mhz\nHardisk: 2x 2TB WD Red Cavier\nI already tried either Software RAID and Hardware RAID. Software RAID can't install bootloader and Hardware RAID won't let me partition.\nThis is my first time directly doing RAID 1 on the OS HDD. Kind of Newbie here. Anyone who had this experience please share. Thank You\n\nA: You can use Live-CD open ubuntu terminal and follow following steps.\n\nsudo su\n\nThen install mdadm \n\napt-get install mdadm\n\nUsing mdadm command to create raid1\n\nmdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=mirror --raid-devices=2\n  /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1\n\nDon't forget change /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1 to match with your drive. And using the same command match all your partitions.\nThen save raid configuration by using.\n\nmdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf\n\nThat's it.\nPS. Sometime I have to download installation from USA source because it won't allow me config raid\n", "Q: is there a game studio for linux I've been looking for some time now for a good game studio. To make xbox and ps4 type games. Does some one know of some software that would work?\n\nA: You can try Pygame.\nPygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language. Pygame is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.Pygame\nFor more information, installation instructions, and to download, visit their website.\nAlso take a look at The Linux Game Studio. \n", "Q: Cross compiling, library gmp not found I'm trying to cross compile StrongSwan package on Ubuntu for Synology NAS using official Synology toolchain.\nHost:\nhostname = ubuntu\nuname -m = i686\nuname -r = 3.8.0-32-generic\nuname -s = Linux\n\nTarget:\nSynology:\n- model DS213+\n- CPU: Freescale QorIQ P1022\n- Arch: PowerPC\n- Endianness: Big Endian\n- Linux 2.6.32\n- uname -a:\nLinux LupoDiskStation 2.6.32.12 #3776 SMP Sat Aug 17 02:11:24 CST 2013 ppc\nGNU/Linux synology_qoriq_213+\n\nWhen I run ./configure, I get error:\n\nconfigure: error: GNU Multi Precision library gmp not found\n\nConfigure command:\nenv CC=/usr/local/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe/bin/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe-gcc \\\nLD=/usr/local/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe/bin/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe-ld \\ \nRANLIB=/usr/local/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe/bin/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe-ranlib \\ \nCFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe/include -mcpu=8548 -mhard-float -mfloat-gprs=double\" \\ \nLDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe/lib\" \\ \n./configure \\ \n--host=powerpc-unknown-linux \\ \n--target=powerpc-unknown-linux \\ \n--build=i686-pc-linux \\ \n--prefix=/usr/local\n\nIf I run ./configure without extra parameters (with ubuntu gcc), I get no errors.\nI can also successfully compile helloworld.c with synology toolchain.\nI've following GMP packages installed:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep gmp\ngmpc                        install\ngmpc-data                   install\ngmpc-dev                    install\nlibgmp-dev                  install\nlibgmp10                    install\nlibgmp3-dev                 install\nlibgmp3c2                   install\nlibgmpada2                  install\nlibgmpxx4ldbl                   install\n\nHeader file is under /usr/include/gmp.h.\nAny idea how to include that gmp.h ? \n\nA: Maybe this will help  in Ubuntu 18.04?\nsudo apt install libgmp-dev\n\nA: It's working now.\nI had to download gmp, cross compile it and copy files to /usr/local/powerpc-none-linux-gnuspe/include dir.\n\nA: Ok so I read into the configure file try.\n./configure \\ \n--host=powerpc-unknown-linux \\ \n--target=powerpc-unknown-linux \\ \n--build=i686-pc-linux \\ \n--prefix=/usr/local \\\n--libdir=\"/usr/include\"\n\n"]
