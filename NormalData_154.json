["Q: How do I stop Flash video being squashed and broken? I recently installed Lubuntu but I have a problem with Adobe Flash Player. I always see something that looks like this when I open a video: \n\n(source: hostingpics.net) \nThe video is small, grainy, and is green and purple.\nI tried to reinstall Flash and to test it in multiple browsers without success.\nI installed an older version of Flash but no result.\n[0300]: Intel Corporation 82865G Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:2572] (rev 02)\n    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company D530 sff(dc578av) [103c:12bc]\n    Kernel driver in use: i915\n\n\nA: This seems to be a problem on some computers with Intel graphics cards and Lubuntu. Only follow this if you're using an Intel graphics card.\nI had the same exact problem with my kids laptop running Lubuntu 13.04.  I installed, and re-installed flash, tried an older version of flash, and other things, and nothing seems to work.  All I had to do was to download and install the latest graphics driver.  In my case it wan an Intel built in graphics adapter. \nNote: I have Lubuntu install updates, and other restricted during installation, and I didn't have to do anything with installing flash.\nOnly Intel\nDownload this driver from Intel. Go for the latest version but make sure that you get the right architecture (32 vs 64 bit). You can check this in a terminal by running uname -i. If it says x86_64, you want the 64 bit version, otherwise assume you need the 32 bit version.\nThen to install it, just press Control+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, navigate to the Downloads folder, and run the command(s) below:\nsudo dpkg -i <file_name>.deb\n\nOnce installed, go under the menu, and click on the Intel driver installer.  I believe it under the accessories menu, but I'm not sure, just look for it.  Once it download the needed files, reboot the system, and see.\n\nA: Try this from your terminal, first remove old unnecessary package :\nsudo apt-get remove --purge adobe-flashplugin flashplugin* nspluginwrapper\n\nReinstall flash :\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall adobe-flashplugin\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu keeps showing up in the boot even after deleting it Heyo,\nLike the title says, ubuntu keeps showing up on the boot menu even after I have deleted the partition it was on (I was dual booting it with windows 8). I google'd a bit and found out I had to download a program called EasyBCD and with it removing the ubuntu option in the boot list. So I did all of that but it still shows up on the boot menu (and in the boot options in EasyBCD). This may also be the reason I cannot install Debian on my laptop, something I have been trying to do for 4 days now (debian doesn't show up on the boot meny, even after a succesful installation). \nIf someone can tell me what is wrong, that would be beautiful.\nThanks.\n\nA: In Windows 8, run msconfig.exe and click on BOOT.INI, there you can delete Ubuntu from the boot loading.\n", "Q: Can the Asus TF700 run ubuntu?

Hasiya Rulzz, I tried this but I don't have any accounts to change the password on and it didn't work with the root account.\nEdit: I am not able to download the rescue cd\n\nA: Unless you specifically set one, your root account probably does not have a password - the assumption being that you would log in as someone else and use sudo.\nThe guest account probably cannot use sudo, as that would be all sorts of badness.\nCan you download and boot from the System Rescue CD (http://www.sysresccd.org/)?\nBefore you boot, do df / to work out which partition your root file system is on. e.g.\n$ df /\nFilesystem     1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1     192114204 101260032  81088596  56% /\n\ntells me I need to remember /dev/sda1.

After that I was in love with dolphin for having thumbnail preview of folder with images inside. So, I thought of setting dolphin as a default file manager. So from the following link I found a solution:\nHow to run Dolphin instead of Nautilus?\nI have not followed the whole artical. Just used the first code:\nsudo mv /usr/bin/nautilus /usr/bin/natilus.back && sudo ln -s /usr/bin/dolphin /usr/bin/nautilus\n\nIt makes my default file manager as dolphin. When I click to home folder launcher it now opens with dolphin. \nNow I want to revert to Nautilus. But I am not getting any way to go back. But I thought if I change the upper code it may revert.

Then just do:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install nautilus\n\nIs impossible to revert the commands since you made two big mistakes, instead of following the answers you followed the question. Also you ran sudo mv /usr/bin/nautilus /usr/bin/natilus.back twice. The second one was totally unnecessary. If you wanted to revert it the correct command for both was:\nsudo unlink /usr/bin/nautilus && sudo mv /usr/bin/nautilus.back /usr/bin/nautilus\n\n\nA: Here is what you did - each piece of code explained:\n\nsudo mv /usr/bin/nautilus /usr/bin/natilus.back\n\nYou renamed the Nautilus program to \"natilus.back\".

I think you renamed your link over your backed up program - nautilus (now the link) over natilus.backup. So now the nautilus program is gone.

How can I extract it in ubuntu 12.04 because it encountered error while extracting. When I google for it I came across this 'http://www.westernwillow.com/cms/blog/franco/open-zipx-file-linux-ubuntu-or-mac-anything-other-windows-7' but it also gives me unsupprted error while installing. Is their any other perfect solution.\n\nA: WinZip through Wine \nIn case we do not have access to a Windows or OSX box where WinZip is installed and running we can also install WinZip through Wine where it is rated Gold or Platinum. ZIPX is supported from version 12.1.\nMy own tests on Wine (Ubuntu 12.04) running WinZIP 15.5 and the most recent version 17.5 lets you compress, and extract ZIPX archives but of course Ubuntu permissions will not be preserved by doing so.\nFor some files (here tested with PNG images) we may still be able to extract them with the Ubuntu Archive Manager, but on most of the files extraction will fail.\nIn case we need to extract ZIPX files more than once we will have to buy the full version but just a single extraction (or compression) will work just fine when running the free 45 day evaluation version.\n\nA: Try to install 7z\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-full\n\nAnd then extract file using,\n\n*\n\n*Extracts all files from archive to the current directory.\n7z e archive.zipx\n\n\n\n*If you want extract files with full paths,\n7z x archive.zipx\n\nSee more options: https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/chm/cmdline/commands/extract.htm\n\nA: The Unarchiver's open-source command-line tools are listed as supporting zipx, so one option is:\nsudo apt-get install unar\n\nThen, you unpack using:\nunar FILENAME.zipx\n\n(The Unarchiver is to MacOS as 7-Zip is to Windows, so they both support a massive swath of formats but there are also many formats where they don't overlap. For example, 7-Zip doesn't support Stuffit .sit and .sitx files and, because macOS supports them natively, The Unarchiver doesn't support .dmg files.)\n\nA: You can not. ZIPX is Windows 7 only at the moment.\n\nSince the ZIPX file format is rather newly introduced by WinZIP, there are few zip utilities supporting it (WinRAR doesn't support ZIPX yet, neither does 7Zip). Thus, if you happen to encounter a corrupt zipx file you cannot repair it since no zipx repair utilities are yet available, so the only option is to go back and repackage the files (if you still have them) and only after that re-create the zipx archive.\n\nSource\n", "Q: Apt-get * wildcard with ZSH ZSH:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntuone-* \nERROR: zsh: no matches found: ubuntuone-*\n\nWorks on Bash. What's the problem ? :-D\n\nA: There are another way to prevent expansion in zsh, which i prefer over quotes:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntuone-\\*\n\n\nA: Yes, zsh and bash behave differently in this regard.\nIn zsh, when you say \"ubuntuone-*\" it looks in your current working directory for files that start with ubuntuone- - since it does not find any, it says \"no matches\" and does not run the command.\nbash takes a different tack - it also looks for files that start with ubuntuone- in the current working directory, but if it does not find any it says to itself, \"Maybe the program I am invoking knows how to handle the wildcard,\" and so passes \"ubuntuone-*\" off to sudo apt-get as a literal argument.\nIf you had a file in your current working directory called ubuntuone-ffdjhjer, then bash would try to execute sudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntuone-ffdjhjer, which would probably fail.\nIn zsh (and in bash) you can use single quotes to tell it not to expand the wildcard but to pass it on, as in:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge 'ubuntuone-*'\n\n\nA: Might be a little late this answer, but there is a way to fix this.

I have done some research on how to do it and I decided to use SNMP. I have done some research and I know that my server will be the manager whereas the switch will act as an agent. My problem is, i am not quite sure of the process of getting the arp tables and having them directed to the mysql database in my server.\n\nA: There are a number of software solutions that can poll network devices via SNMP and store their MAC address tables in a SQL database. Generally, their functionality includes a great deal more than what you are asking for in your question.\nBefore installing the software on a server, it is important to note that you should have administrative access to the network devices, or at the very least, permission to query the devices in question. Either you, or your IT support folks, will need to configure the switches with permit SNMP string as well as permit SNMP queries from the server IP/subnet that it resides on. How these device are configured is vendor dependant and beyond the apparent scope of your question.\nOne example of such a tool available for Ubuntu is Netdisco. \nPer their website, Netdisco is a software package that maintains \"Configuration information and connection data for network devices [that is] ... retrieved via SNMP. Data is stored using a SQL database for scalability and speed. Layer-2 topology protocols such as CDP and LLDP provide automatic discovery of the network topology.\"\n\nWhile there is a package available for install from the Ubuntu repositories (see netdiso-common, netdisco-backend, and netdisco-frontend) it is somewhat outdated. A more recent version can be installed from source on their site.\nAnother example would be IPPlan which focuses on IP Address Management(IPAM), DNS and circuit management. IPPLAN polls via the ucd-snmp package and NMAP and can map IP addresses to MAC addresses in a variety of SQL databases.\n\nAlso, you may want to take a look at Switchmap. \n\nWhile it does not store its data in SQL, it creates CSV files which can then be poured into a SQL database, if desired.\nThere are a number of other solutions out there (both commercial and free). I only mention these as I have had direct experience installing, configuring, and managing these software packages.\n\nA: MAC addresses are stored in the MIB .1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.3.1.2\nSo, you can do something like this:\nsnmpwalk -v2c -c <community> <SwitchIP> .1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.3.1.2\n\nYou will get a dump with these numbers followed by the six words of the MAC address in integer form. So, it is up to you to get the last 6 integers, convert them to hex and finally, store them on your database.\nThe response will tell you too in which port the switch \"sees\" the MAC address.\nExample:\niso.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.3.1.2.208.39.136.84.36.11 = INTEGER: 25\n\nMeans the MAC address 208.39.136.84.36.11 (convert it to hex if you want) is reachable through the port 25 of that switch.\n\nA: We use a tool called NetDB on Ubuntu that scrapes all of our routers and switches and puts them in a MySQL database.

I'm using Ubuntu 13.04. My laptop is Acer Aspire one 722-c58rr, and my ethernet card works for a few seconds at a time with kernels 3.8.x, however, kernels 3.5.x and below worked fine.\nOn kernels 3.8.x, it works fine after boot for about a minute, then it looses network connection. When pinging to some address, it says: network address is unreachable, but it can ping it's own address. The address is statically configured.\nEverything was working fine before. I went to vacation, where I used WiFi and 3G connections, so I didn't notice that the problem occurred. Came back home, plugged in into the ethernet. It worked for a minute then stopped. Rebooting commutator fixed the problem. Tried to connect to a different commutator, same problem. Unplugging and plugging the cable fixes the problem for another minute. Disconnecting eth in Network manager and reconnecting it again, does the same thing. WiFi has no such problem.\nTried to use a different cable that works fine on another computer, the same problem.\nTried to boot with the lower kernel version, the same problem was happening until I got to the version 3.5 of the kernel series.\nEverything works fine on the kernel 3.5.x, but I don't want to miss out on the new kernel's features.\nExecuting commands, when booted with 3.8 kernel series, give the following results:\n\n  lspci| grep -i eth:\n    06:00.0 Ethernet controller: Qualcomm Atheros AR8152 v2.0 Fast Ethernet (rev c1)\n\n  dmesg| grep eth1:\n    [ 89.548291] atl1c 0000:06:00.0: atl1c: eth1 NIC Link is Up\n\nHow do I fix it, while staying in the new kernel version?\n\nA: I'm afraid you slipped into a kernel bug for your particular ethernet card (bug reports here and here). I suggest you to post your feedback to those threads.\nIt seems that removing and adding back the atl1c module fixes the issue temporarily:\nsudo rmmod atl1c\nsudo modprobe atl1c\n\nAnother more durable solution is to recompile the compact-wireless module you can find on kernel.org like so:\nsudo rmmod atl1c\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential wget\nwget http://wireless.kernel.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2\ntar-xjf compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2\ncd compat-wireless*\nscripts/driver-select atl1c\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe atl1c\n\nIf it doesn't work try to reboot.\n\nA: afaik, the best solution is to update your kernel to the latest, as the fix was included in 3.11 and later kernels.\nI'm not posting how to update the kernel manually because it's very easy to find tutorials by just googling \"updating linux kernel in ubuntu\" or somesuch.\n", "Q: How to access hidden GRUB in Xubuntu I have recently installed Xubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows XP. My parents don't use Xubuntu, so I configured the GRUB file as written in some articles. I changed:\nGRUB_DEFAULT= 4 #Assuming Windows is the fifth menu entry\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 \n\nNow whenever I press and hold the Shift key it says GRUB loading, but does not show GRUB and boots directly into XP. How can I access grub.cfg to change the settings so I'll have correct settings?\n\nA: You should be able to boot from the xubuntu CD in live CD mode - then you can mount the / or /boot file system and make the changes you need to make.\nAlternately you can boot the system rescue CD (http://www.sysresccd.org/) and do the same.\nThe tricky part of this is working out which disk partition has /boot on it.\nOnce you have started xubuntu in Live CD mode open a terminal and use sudo to get a root shell. Alternately, boot the system rescue CD and it will drop you in a root shell.\nThen look in /dev for files like sda1 sda2 sdb1 etc.\nTry mounting each in turn:\n# mount /dev/sd1 /mnt\n# ls /mnt\n# umount /mnt\n\nIf mount gives an error, ignore that partition. If ls /mnt shows a directory called boot, then look in there for the files you have to change to reconfigure grub.\n\nA: You can use the LiveCD to boot from, and edit grub.cfg that way.  Mount the partition where /boot is, and edit /boot/grub/menu.lst. Change the timeout.  Also try pressing the Esc key, and see if that helps.  \nAnother way is to use Grub Customizer, also from the LiveCD.  For information on how to install Grub Customizer, once the LiveCD is up and running, see HOWTO: Grub Customizer\nOther options you can use GParted, and Super Grub Disk\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't restart, but logs-out when restart button is pressed The issues I am having with my Ubuntu is that when I am going for a restart, from the tray icon - Shutdown-->restart, it doesn't restart, but actually just logs out and gives me the ubuntu login screen again.

I am to lazy to switch the only SATA CD/DVD-ROM device I have and use that. Also, I just wanted to know whether this would be an interesting experience. Not so far...\nThis is what happened: \n\n\n*\n\n*I created a new computer with following specs: \n\n*\n\n*CPU: AMD Athlon 2 X4 (soc FM1)\n\n*Mobo: MSI A55-P33 \n\n*GPU : MSI Ati Radeon R5450\n\n*PS: 400Watt\n\n*Memory: 4GB\n\n*no disk player\n\n*This setup should do the trick. \n\n\n*Then I created a boot able USB stick using various tools pointed out to my by the support page from Ubuntu itself on the subject on using USB keys and installing Ubuntu. Because early attempts failed, I tried more then one of them. I used a USB stick of 14GB.\n\n*Then I put in the USB key and started up. \n\n\nNow, what is the problem? \nI come into the setup menu, so the stick is being read. I see the normal choices like 'install Ubuntu', 'install multiple servers using MAAS', 'memory test', 'disk check' and the rest. \nWhenever I try to use any of these, the screen turns black, and the computer resets. Just like that. The only option from the menu that will work is the memory test. \nWhat am I doing wrong? Is something wrong with the key? Is something wrong with my install iso (I used the same ISO to burn on a disk, no problems there installing it)? Is something wrong with my hardware setup? \nI know I can always switch my CD/DVD-rom, but I'd rather loose some more time trying to get this USB thing under way. \nEDIT:\nInstalled CD/DVD ROM device and tried a working disk I burned earlier. Some problem, after picking some menu option, screen turns black and computer resets.\n\nA: After much more trouble I decided to turn my computer in at the hardware shop. Turns out the power supply was just no longer good enough to withstand an installation process. Which was very weird, since I had just used it on a different older system where I installed the same OS.\n\nA: Most likely its a GPU driver issue that yields black-screen.

All the symlinks in our sites-enabled dirs were missing a .conf extension so those files wouldn't get included in the config. \nHowever, something the way Apache handles access control changed between the versions as well. According to http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html#access I had to change \nOrder allow,deny\nAllow from all\n\nin the vhost config to\nRequire all granted\n\nor include the mod_access_compat  module.\nNow, my question is ... I always felt that LTS releases should be update-able without breaking anything. With that I mean the ability to run \nsudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade without breaking anything. Was that assumption wrong? If so, where and how can I find out in advance what will happen the next time? What I mean is, how do I find out that I will have to modify my apache / php / whatever config after updating?\n\nA: Are you sure that Apache 2.4 was installed from one of Ubuntu's canonical repositories?  Are you using any PPAs?\nApache 2.2 to 2.4 was upgraded on me by a 3rd party PPA for PHP 5.4.  It was changed to PHP 5.5 and Apache 2.4 was added to the PPA at one point.  A new Vagrant up after a destroy broke when I ran into the same problem you did and the vhost config was incompatible with Apache 2.4.\nWhat does the output from \"apt-cache policy apache2\" look like?  I've just created a new blank Vagrant instance and performed a sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade.  This is my output:\n\nt# apt-cache policy apache2\napache2:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 2.2.22-1ubuntu1.4\n  Version table:\n     2.2.22-1ubuntu1.4 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/main amd64 Packages\n     2.2.22-1ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n\nI suspect that you'll see Apache 2.4 came from a 3rd party repo and not the canonical repositories for 12.04.\n\nA: I can confirm this issue as well. On 11/27, I did all Ubuntu updates using Webmin. The vhosts broke but have now been easily fixed by adding .conf extension.  Adding\n<Directory />\n  Options All\n  AllowOverride All\n  Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nto my vhost files did the trick.  \nAlso in my case, the uploadprogess PHP extension was also broken as per my Drupal status reports. The solution that finally worked was to simply uninstall with PECL and reinstall. The Apache update apparently moved the .so file into another dir and reinstalling put it back in the proper location.\nAs for a third party repository being the source of 2.4, the only ones that have been added were 2 for Webmin. I've never worried about system updates before but I guess now I have to :(  I think Ubuntu messed up.\n", "Q: No clue how to download Skype onto Asus 1015e I recently bought an Asus 1015e, but I have no idea how to correctly download Skype.

You get the message\nTry 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution)\n\nbut instead of apt-get -f install you execute sudo dpkg --configure -a \"to get the all dependencies\". That is not what dpkg does. \nFrom the manpage of dpkg:\n   --configure package...|-a|--pending\n          Configure a package which has been unpacked but not yet  config‐\n          ured.   If  -a  or  --pending  is  given instead of package, all\n          unpacked but unconfigured packages are configured.\n\nThat is not the matter here. Apparently dpkg is not able to configure some packages succesfully due to unmet dependencies---not because unpacking of packages had been interrupted for any reason. Resolving dependencies by installing missing packages lays in the realm of apt. From the apt-get manpage:\n   -f, --fix-broken\n       Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place.\n       This option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages\n       to permit APT to deduce a likely solution. If packages are\n       specified, these have to completely correct the problem. \n\nTherefore the command that comes at hand and which was advertised by the error message is:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nFrom the actual broken dependencies that are presented in your copy&paste I take that this simple command should do the trick. If not, refer to this question or post exact error messages from above command.\nThe cause of this might be that you did not do an apt-get update beforehand. The packages list that apt holds point to individual packages in the repository. When one or more packages are upgrade in the repository for any reasons then older packages will be purged. The dependent packages then point to packages that are not provided anymore. \nYou do not have to run apt-get update every time you do an install, but you may end up with a situation like this. However that's easily fixed by sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f.\n\nA: Try to install manual openjdk-6-jre (sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre) - when it is not possible run \"apt-cache policy openjdk-6-jre\" to see if you have a source for it. When you don’t have a source you miss universe and/or security sources in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Possible you miss also a \"sudo apt-get update\"?\nor try to remove the packages with:\nsudo dpkg --purge bleachbit ca-certificates-java icedtea-6-plugin icedtea-netx\n\nThen try again to install what you want to install or just install oracle java:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\n", "Q: How to change proprietary video driver using the command line? My laptop computer has a Nvidia video card and runs Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit. During an upgrade yesterday it seemed as a new Nvidia driver version 304 (if I remember correct) was installed. After upgrade and reboot, I opened the Additional Driver tool and found that the Nvidia driver version 304 was in use. So far so good.\nHowever, the Additional Driver tool also reported that there existed a Nvidia driver version 319 and that this driver version was recommended. I then selected to change to this recommended driver, the driver was downloaded and installed, I rebooted the system and ended up with a black screen and a command shell.\nHow to change proprietary Nvidia video driver using the command line and revert back to the previous version that worked on my system?\n(A second question: How can it be that a video driver that apparently does not work was recommended?)\n\nA: As per this Ubuntu Community Help Wiki Page, Ubuntu 14.04+ is different:\nUbuntu 14.04 and up\nThe jockey-text command was removed with the release of Ubuntu 14.04.

You can see which partitions are already mounted by using the df command and rule them out. Out of the remaining partitions in the output of fdisk -l the ones with SYSTEM HPFS/NTFS are the likely targets. If you have more than one Windows partition you can guess which is which by the size or just mount them in different locations and try.\nNormally your windows partitions should at least be visible in your File Manager. Make sure you have ntfs-3g installed or install it using sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g first before trying to mount the drives.\nYou can mount a drive to any existing empty directory using (replace the X in /dev/sdX with your partition number):\nmkdir /mnt/windows-drive\nmount -t ntfs-3g -o rw /dev/sdX /mnt/windows-drive\n\n", "Q: avconv does not support setting profile for mp4/h264/aac Hi I am trying to convert a wmv video to mp4 using h264 baseline profile.\navconv -i 'Video2.WMV' \\\n-vcodec libx264 -preset ultrafast -profile baseline \\\n-acodec aac -strict experimental \\\n-r 24 -b 255k -ar 44100 -ab 59k 'Video2.mp4'\n\nBut it is showing following errors:\n[aac @ 0x707e40] [Eval @ 0x7fff0c8db800] Undefined constant or missing '(' in 'baseline'\n[aac @ 0x707e40] Unable to parse option value \"baseline\"\n[aac @ 0x707e40] Error setting option profile to value baseline.\n\nProfile setting is causing the errors.

I'd also reccommend installing any 3rd party icons in your home folder ~/.icons/ and trying to see what went wrong there.\nUPDATE:\nNow the missing icons would be for the applications which install icons to /usr/share/icons when you install them but their icons are missing now.

I wrote a small shell script to turn the touchpad off and on.\n\n*TouchPad off:\n$ cd /usr/local/bin\n$ sudo nano touchpad-off\n\n#!/bin/bash\n# touchpad off\nxinput --set-prop 14 \"Device Enabled\" 0\necho touchpad off\n\n\n*TouchPad on:\n$ cd /usr/local/bin\n$ sudo nano touchpad-on\n\n#!/bin/bash\n# touchpad on\nxinput --set-prop 14 \"Device Enabled\" 1\necho touchpad on\n\n\n*Make the scripts executable with:\nchmod +x touchpad-off\nchmod +x touchpad-on\n\nNow you can easily toggle the touchpad state with touchpad-off and touchpad-on in your terminal.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04 I had to use from the terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad send-events enabled\n\nTo get to the Terminal I used the command key and then typed in \"terminal\" and hit enter. Hope this helps someone else caught with their mouse down.\n\nA: Ok, let’s be presice. If you disable/switch OFF your touchpad through System Settings (Gnome Control Center) you can’t re-enable it with xinput! When you have no other mouse or pointer device, you have to go to System Settings using your keyboard.\nFortunately, Unity is well designed for both keyboard and mouse, so without a mouse you can still do everything. For example, you can press Alt+F10 to open top menu and then navigate to System Settings with arrow keys. Or simply press Super(or ) to open the Dash and search for mouse. Select it with down arrow key (↓) and press Enter to open. \n\nFinally using Tab select the Touchpad switch – the orange box around the switch shows that you’re on the right place. Toggle it ON by hitting Space or Enter.\n \n\nA: *\n\n*Press the Menu key on your keyboard.\n\n*Navigate down to the Change Desktop Background option and hit ENTER\n\n*Using the TAB key, navigate to the \"all settings\" page and the search field.\n\n*Type Mouse and use TAB and ENTER to select it.\n\n*Use the TAB key to go down to the toggle switch in the Touchpad section, and use SPACE to mark it as on.\n\n\nYour touchpad should be re-enabled.\n\nA: I have found that xinput works the best for switching touchpad on/off on my linux mint 18.3 Jumper Ezbook 3 Pro (4.10.0.38 kernel) versus using GUI System setings -> Mouse and touchpad -> Touchpad -> On/Off slider\nI used script provided in above answer by Seth Bergman, but wanted to share 2 improvements to it.\n1) Id of the device sometimes change, so you cant have it like fixed number in your script. Sometimes id=14, and sometimes 15.\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SYNA3602:00 0911:5288 Touchpad            id=15   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n#!/bin/bash\n# touchpad off\nDeviceID=$(xinput -list | grep Touchpad | awk '{print $6}' | sed 's/id=//')\nxinput --set-prop $DeviceID \"Device Enabled\" 1\necho touchpad on\n\nOf course you should change  'Touchpad' to the name or number of your Touchpad Device. That way, whatever the device id becomes, the script will always work.\n2) You can make a shortcut to your scripts to use them quickly. In Linux Mint you should go to the Menu -> System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts -> Add Custom Shortcut. In command field just paste the path to your script file like that: /usr/local/bin/touchpad-on and name of choice.\nAnd the add key-bindings of choise.\net voilà! \n", "Q: Redirect URL to return same content I need to run a test application that loads many images from an external url.\nDuring tests I don't want to access to the external url, so every time it tries to load an image in this way:\n<img src=\"www.externaldomain/somewhere/image1.jpg\">\n<img src=\"www.externaldomain/from/there/image2.gif\">\n\netc.\nit will get a \"local\" image (always the same image) from the same server that is running the test application.\nHow can I get that in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: If I understand well your question, you can use:\n<img src=\"file:///path/to/image1.jpg\" />\n\nFor example, if your default location for your web server is /var/www and the pictures are in /var/www/pictures:\n<img src=\"file:///var/www/pictures/image1.jpg\" />\n\n\nA: if u invert the images and inline them, it works even with curl axiom reverted in scramble\n", "Q: Login using NFS and LDAP only after about 2 minutes possible Setup:\nNFS&LDAP Server Ubuntu 10.04\nClient Ubuntu 13.04\nAfter starting the client login is only possible after about 2 minutes.

When I try to execute the command with some argument I get:\n\n0: command not found\n\nWhat has changed that I cannot use this abbreviation anymore?\nP.S. Of course it's possible to change the alias name, it's just a question out of curiousity.\n\nA: ? is a glob (pattern, wildcard) that'll match filenames consisting of exactly one character; it gets replaced by matching files in the current directory. If there are no matching files in the current directory, ? will remain unchanged, and your function will be triggered. This is called Pathname Expansion in man bash and Filename expansion in the bash reference manual\nIn this case, you apparently have a file named 0 in the current directory, so ? foo gets changed to 0 foo by pathaname expansion, then it tries to run a command named 0 with foo as argument. If you remove/rename that file to something longer than one character, your function should start working. Alternatively you can use \\? or \"?\" or '?' instead, to avoid it being treated as a glob.\nOn a side note, using ? in a function name is undocumented and not recommended. Only alphanumerics and underscore are documented to work (same as what's allowed for variable names).\n", "Q: I can not connect intenet through dongle I am using vodafone dongle but when I am using it ,it is detected inside computerwhile connecting take long time  but can not connect to internet\n\nA: you might want to check the operating system you are on. check if the dongle is configured for windows or *nix systems. also, check if you are running software for unix, it has sufficient permissions. if the gui for the software pops up on screen, you might want to check the settings for the particular dongle. \n", "Q: Skype Freezes Sporadically I've been having the problem ever since I started using Skype on Ubuntu, some two years ago.

I know the MainView component is the recommended container for all widgets that are part of an Ubuntu Touch app. However, I'd like to understand whether it is essential to use it and what it brings to an app. From the documentation:\n\nMainView is the root Item that should be used for all applications. It\n  automatically adds a header and toolbar for its contents and can\n  rotate its content based on the device orientation.\n\nBasically, I'd like to know exactly what features or properties MainView adds to an Ubuntu Touch app and if it's a strict requirement to use it to write convergent apps for Ubuntu.\nA use case would be for an app that does not need a header.\n\nA: Headers and toolbars are part of the MainView, so you would have to implement that yourself if you don't use MainView.\nAlso the MainView has an \"ActionManager\" which is needed for actions from the app to become available to the HUD. Other properties that we need (for example for application switching) such as an AppID may also be added to the MainView.\nSo it is highly recommended to use the MainView, even if you don't use headers or toolbars. I can imagine that some special apps (games?) would not be using MainView, but then you may end up implementing functionality of MainView yourself. Of course this is possible (since MainView and all related classes are open source), but it is something that is hard for us to support.\n", "Q: How to host a project on Launchpad?

When you run snmpbulkwalk, you're actually running its binary file which is located probably in /bin or /usr/bin. To find out what this path is, run which snmpbulkwalk. Let's say this returns /usr/bin/snmpbulkwalk. Therefore, your cronjob would be:\n*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/snmpbulkwalk -v 2c -c public -OXsq  172.16.1.210 .1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2 > /tmp/S01_ARP.txt\n\n\nA: If I understand you correctly you want to know how to setup this cronjob. Just hit\n crontab -e\n\nThen choose your favorite editor (for me that's vim) copy and paste the line above and make sure it is followed by a white line. Then save it (in vim you hit ESC and  type :wq.

(No Grub) So I just got a brand new Dell XPS 13 which comes preinstalled with Windows 8 Pro. I decided to install Ubuntu 13.04 and dual-boot. I made a bootable USB, booted up the Ubuntu installer and found that it didn't recognise my Windows 8 OS to install \"alongside\", so I realised I would need to make my partitions manually. I went back into windows and used the disk manager to shrink my C drive by 100GB. There were about 5 other partitions like EFI and stuff that I ignored. Then, back to the ubuntu installer, made a primary partition of ext4 and a 20Gb Swap partition. I finished the installer, and Ubuntu works great!\nNow my problem. I have no way of booting Windows. Every time I start the machine, it goes straight into Ubuntu. I have tried holding down Shift, but don''t see any GRUB screen. Ubuntu works great, but how do I boot to Windows???\n\nA: There are at least two possible causes of your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*You've installed Ubuntu in EFI mode but the GRUB configuration tool has failed to identify Windows, and so is booting through GRUB but with a short timeout and a hidden menu.\n\n*You've installed Ubuntu in BIOS mode, which means that it can't boot Windows (which is in EFI mode), and so GRUB is using a short timeout and a hidden menu.\n\n\nIf you're booting in EFI mode, this might be a bit easier to fix, since you should be able to run Boot Repair from your current Ubuntu and it should be fixed. To determine if you're in EFI mode, look for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you're booting in EFI mode; but if it's absent, you're probably booting in BIOS mode.\nIf you're booting in BIOS mode, you can fix the problem by installing an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. You can do this in any of several ways, but two relatively easy ones are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a live CD-R or USB flash drive in EFI mode and run Boot Repair. This should get GRUB up and running with Windows detected. The trick is forcing an EFI-mode boot of a live CD. You may need to play with your firmware's boot options. Typically, hitting a function key (which one varies) produces a boot menu, and you should select the one for your live CD that mentions \"EFI\" or \"UEFI.\"\n\n*Download the CD-R or USB flash drive image of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a medium with it. You should then be able to boot to it. If rEFInd lets you boot both Windows and Linux, boot to Linux, mount your EFI System Partition (ESP) to /boot/efi, and install the Debian-package version of rEFInd. You'll then use rEFInd to select your OS on subsequent boots.\n\n\nIf one of these fails, try the other one. If you continue to have problems, post back with the URL that Boot Repair provides; this will give us detailed information on your system's configuration.\n\nA: Reboot your laptop and enter in your boot menu with F12.\nNow look for Windows 8 boot option and select it if it's there.\nPS: This solved my problem\n", "Q: How to install bind dns server and apache web server in ubuntu?

How can I possibly resize the root partition?\nThe VM is Ubuntu server 12.04.\n\nA: You need to connect your VM with the iso of a live CD - the file you can download. I assume you are not using a GUI-Tool (like virt-manager ), so you will have to do it from the command line.\nYou can use virsh to get an XML file of the VM config (I called my VM qemu1)\nvirsh dumpxml qemu1 > qemu1-config.xml\n\nNow edit that file, look for something like\n<disk type='file' device='cdrom'>\n  <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>\n  <target dev='hdc' bus='ide' tray='open'/>\n  <readonly/>\n  <alias name='ide0-1-0'/>\n  <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='1' target='0' unit='0'/>\n</disk>\n\nand replace it with\n<disk type='file' device='cdrom'>\n  <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>\n  <source file='/media/data/isos/gparted-live-0.13.0-1.iso'/>\n  <target dev='hdc' bus='ide'/>\n  <readonly/>\n  <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='1' target='0' unit='0'/>\n</disk>\n\nThe important points are\n\n\n*\n\n*adapt the paths and file names\n\n*the line <source file=.../> contains the iso-file\n\n*the line <target .../> should not contain tray open now\n\n\nAnd now you put the new settings into effect with\nvirsh define qemu1-config.xml\n\nThe VM will need a restart.\n\nA: Here is what worked in the end:\nEnlage the img (virtual disk image) file for the VM:\n\n*\n\n*Create raw disc file\nsudo qemu-img create -f raw addon.raw 10G\n\n\n\n*Backup current img\nsudo mv domain.img domain.old.img\n\n\n\n*Combine original and extra to create img file of new larger size.\nsudo cat domain.old.img addon.raw >> domain.img\n\nNow we have a larger image but the VM still has old partition table.\nNow the tricky part.\nThe next steps are done on the host machine with VM shutdown\nDownload iso file for gparted:\nwget -c http://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted-live-stable/0.6.4-1/gparted-live-0.6.4-1.iso\n\nBoot the iso with the virtual image as the harddrive in the virtual system\nkvm -m 512 -hda domain.img -cdrom gparted-live-0.6.4-1.iso -boot d\n\nWe are basically launching a virtual system kvm that will boot from the cdrom -boot d and gparted is in the cdrom -cdrom gparted-live-0.6.4-1.iso and in this virtual system treat domain.img as the harddrive -hda domain.img and allocate 512mb memory for this virtual system-m 512.\nNow gparted pops up with a nice GUI (there is probably a command line option as well) ready to repartition your virtual disk.\nNow you can manipulate the partition table just like you were using a liveCD on a real machine.\nMost of this information was taken from this blog post by Chris Walden.\nThanks guntbert for pointing me in the right direction (i.e. it is possible to boot a VM from a liveCD).\n\nA: You can use gParted and the resize from command line.

I have disabled password prompt by default under visudo by giving my username 'nopasswd' privilege.\n\nA: Generally, the owner of the applications in Ubuntu is root. For example check the applications from /usr/bin. You can check this with ls -l /usr/bin. For Firefox Web Browser, the result is:\nls -l /usr/bin/firefox\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25 aug  3 23:37 /usr/bin/firefox -> ../lib/firefox/firefox.sh\n\nSo, to lock Firefox for other users than root, you need to take out the execute permission for group and others. You can do this with the following command:\nsudo chmod 766 /usr/bin/firefox\n\nor\nsudo chmod go-x /usr/bin/firefox\n\n\n\nA: as you have mentioned in your question that , if you want to lock an application that could be accessed by only root means , just change the permissions. \nsudo chown root:root /usr/bin/firefox\nsudo chmod 700 /usr/bin/firefox\n\nfor example I made it for pidgin: \njai@frank-Jai:~$ sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/pidgin\n[sudo] password for jai: $$$$$$\njai@frank-Jai:~$ sudo chmod 700 /usr/bin/pidgin\njai@frank-Jai:~$ pidgin\n bash: /usr/bin/pidgin: Permission denied\n\njai@frank-Jai:~$ \n\nnext time onwards if you would like to open firefox means type as \nsudo firefox\n\nPlease note that in some rare cases (but it is something that is true for e.g. Firefox and Chromium), when a command is called, there is a script that is called first and then it is the one that launches the \"normal\" program executable. If you disable the script from running you will prevent anyone from running the application normally (e.g. from shortcuts or commands e.g. firefox). If someone knows where the \"normal\" executable of that application is located, then he will be able to launch it without any problem through a terminal.

My suspicion is that you're experiencing filesystem damage. This is common on systems that dual-boot with Windows 8 because of a Windows 8 feature called \"fast startup.\" This feature essentially turns the shutdown operation into a suspend-to-disk operation. This works fine on a single-boot computer, but when the computer dual-boots with another OS, the result is dangerous filesystem problems, at least on any filesystem that's shared between OSes (including the EFI System Partition [ESP]). To fix this, boot to Windows and disable fast startup. Note that this feature is not the same as the fast boot option in your firmware; disabling this feature in the firmware does not disable it in Windows 8.\nIf you disable fast startup and the problem persists, then you could try doing a filesystem check on your ESP, as in dosfsck /dev/sda1. (The device file in Linux might be different, though. Use parted or GParted to find the FAT partition with a \"boot flag\" set, or use gdisk to find the partition with a type code of EF00.)\nIf the problem persists even after you disable fast boot and fix the filesystem, please try the following diagnostics:\ngrep efi /etc/fstab\nsudo blkid\n\nCompare the results -- the /etc/fstab file defines where partitions are mounted, and so searching it for efi should produce details on how your system is mounting the ESP. For instance, on my system, it shows the following:\n$ grep efi /etc/fstab\n# /boot/efi was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=FFB3-46B6  /boot/efi   vfat    defaults    0   1\n\nThe blkid command produces information on all your computer's filesystems. You want to compare what it shows for your ESP (usually /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, or /dev/sda3) to what's in /etc/fstab. For instance:\n$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: SEC_TYPE=\"msdos\" LABEL=\"ESP\" UUID=\"FFB3-46B6\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Fred\" UUID=\"421258c1-e9b1-4b1b-9dd7-60b82e75f8c3\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"9108d33b-855d-49ba-8b9e-90f981a597ea\" TYPE=\"swap\"\n\nIn this case, /dev/sda1 is the ESP -- it's a FAT (TYPE=\"vfat\") filesystem, and its serial number matches what's in /etc/fstab (UUID=\"FFB3-46B6\"), so all is in order. A mismatch of the serial numbers or some other detail might cause the problem you're encountering. If you need more help, please edit your post with this information and the exact error message you're seeing.\n\nA: I've just had a similar problem when using boot-repair to move to UEFI. Sounds silly, but I just put double quotes around the UUID value, did sudo mount -a (or reboot)  and the error went away.\nSo I would change your /etc/fstab entry from \nUUID=F433-DF4C  /boot/efi       vfat    defaults        0       1\n\nto\nUUID=\"F433-DF4C\"  /boot/efi       vfat    defaults        0       1\n\n", "Q: How to install TP-LINK TL-WR841ND router I bought a TP-LINK TL-WR841ND router, but it isn't supported by Linux. \nCan someone help me to install it in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: You don't install a router, you just plug it in to your LAN, and configure it.

You can find in-depth guide to packaging here.\n\nA: Quickly is a great little tool for producing and packaging Ubuntu (PyGTK) GUI applications - quickly. It takes out most of the manual, repeating work involved, so that you can entirely focus on your application's functionality instead of setup details.\nThe Qt Software Development Kit (SDK) is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a graphical user interface (GUI).\nHow to Install Qt SDK on Ubuntu Linux\nHere is a list of handy open source development tools for use on Ubuntu such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and powerful editors.\nAnjuta is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C and C++.\nBazaar-NG is a decentralised version control system used for Ubuntu development.\nBluefish is a powerful editor for experienced web designers and programmers.\nEclipse is an IDE for Java and other programming languages.

It ties in with the plans by Canonical, the organisation which develops Ubuntu with the community, for Ubuntu to be a single OS that runs across phones, tablets and desktops.\nApps created using the SDK are primarily built using QML, a Javascript-based language for designing application interfaces that can use C++ for the heavy lifting. Ubuntu apps built using QML can have UIs that can scale across different form factors.

As you can see from the image below the icon is the default one and it should be the one shown on the desktop as this is the one I prefer. I've done an updatedb, located all eclipse.png files and replaced them with the new one and still the default icon shows. Is there some kind of cache that the launcher uses? Thanks in advance.\nhttp://postimg.org/image/bmopwxnal/\n\nA: I have the feeling that Unity indeed \"caches\" the icon used. But I guess the real problem is that you forgot to change something in the application launcher or icons.\nTo identify where the launcher is stored , first open Eclipse. Alter that, in a terminal use the following command:\n$ xprop\n\nYour mouse cursor should change to a cross. Then click on any part of the Eclipse window. You should get a lot of text (like the ASCII version of the icons used). There find for NET_WM_DESKTOP_FILE. In my case I get the following:\n_NET_WM_DESKTOP_FILE(STRING) = \"/home/<myusername>/.local/share/applications/eclipse_android.desktop\"\n\nThen just open that file (you may need root permission) and check you are really using the correct icon.\nAlso note that the Eclipse icon probably should be stored in many different sizes, so you will need to replace everyone. Using apt-file I get the following:\n$ apt-file search eclipse.png\neclipse-platform-data: /usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/eclipse.png\neclipse-platform-data: /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/eclipse.png\neclipse-platform-data: /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/eclipse.png\neclipse-platform-data: /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/eclipse.png\neclipse-platform-data: /usr/share/pixmaps/eclipse.png\n\nAs those files probably will be rewritten in any Eclipse update, probably it is easier if you place your custom icon in /usr/share/icons for example, and just replace the Icon stanza (from the Eclipse .desktop) with the full path to that icon.\nIf the problem is indeed caching, then I really don't know how to fix it.\n\nA: As I know (and see in 13.04) Unity doesn’t use cache for app icons and if you change an app icon, the change will be shown in few seconds.\nTo change the icon permamently, simply put the SVG or PNG into ~/.icons – create one if it doesn’t exist.

I've chosen to encrypt the entire installation, but the installer later asked me whether I wanted to encrypt personal folder under /home. What should I choose?\n\nA: Encrypting your home folder will let you have your data protected by the account's password.\nIf you are logged into your account you won't be asked to insert the password, but, if you want to access the files while you're logged out (with another username for example) you'll be asked for.\nIn my opinion I think is better to have it, with a strong password, to prevent leak of data from people who takes you HDD off and try to read data in it.\nWatch out that by encrypting the home folder when you access the files in it the reading time will be a little more than having it unencrypted\n\nA: The encryption on your home folder is your choice. It makes it so you have to input a password every time you attempt to open your home folder. I usually don't but I don't need anything hidden.\n\nA: By encrypting home, will be possible to access the data after you login.

I decided to check if this was a problem with all X programs, but I was able to open xeyes on multiple remote machines.\nMy question is, why does remotely opening gedit on one machine prevent me from opening it on another until the first ssh session is closed? And is there a way to fix this or a workaround? I don't need to have multiple gedits open at once, but I'd least like to be able to not have to close the connection to one of the machines before I can open it on another.\nMy ssh_config is set up with 'ForwardX11' and 'ForwardX11Trusted' both set to yes, in case this is pertinent.\nUpdate: I decided to try a few more programs, and found that while I can have nautilus open through ssh on multiple machines, I get a number of the connection refused warnings before it opens.  \n\nA: export $(dbus-launch) on the remote machine solved this problem for me.\n\nA: This is a problem with whatever is acting as the X Display manager (or X server) on the PC/laptop from where you are testing gedit.

It would allow you to manage your local X displays, and authorize remote apps to display on your local system.\n\nA: 1) Use a commandline text editor\nssh into the remote machine via the terminal and use nano or vi to open the text file and edit.\nI find nano to be more newbie-friendly, in part because it shows you the key combinations for various actions directly in your terminal window.\nTo open a file using nano: nano filename.txt or sudo nano filename.txt (if you need root privileges)\n\n2) Use nautilus/gedit on local machine\nOpen a nautilus file browser window and select \"connect to server\" from the menu in the top panel.\n\nEnter in the server info (use ssh:// or sftp:// for ssh connections).\n\nOnce connected you can bookmark the location using ctrl+d.

Did a chroot from a rescue disk and fixed grub.\nBooted from a usb port on my old intel box for which there are no drivers.\nctl+alt+f1  gave me a shell.\nin /etc/lightdm/lightdm.cfg found autologon for user. Disabled it by inserting # at start of line.\nran dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\nran service lightdm restart\nThis gave me a logon screen. Changed the session to the top option (I think gdm) and was able to logon. \nLogged out and changed the session back to ubuntu unity.\nPeter\n", "Q: HDMI display suddenly not recognized anymore I'm having a critical issue on my production machine. Until yesterday, I've been working with my laptop connected to an external display through HDMI.\nNow, when I switch the pc on, the display says \"no signal\".\nIf I book in Windows7, everything works.\nWhat can I do?\nThanks a lot!!\n\nA: Same thing happened to me today, but I got the display back by booting with an older kernel. Obviously not a good fix, but works as a temporary workaround.\nNot sure yet what's causing it.

I am currently on Ubuntu 13.04 (64 bit version) with the proprietary Nvidia driver 313, the system is also dual-boot with Windows.\nThis whole thing happened today after update of the OS, as far as I know there was no problem yesterday, it must have been from the update I think.\nThe player itself is working (playing movies, rewind, pause), but as mentioned the menus and controls aren't displaying, as well as the context menu when right clicking.\n\nA: Delete the ~/.config/vlc directory to remove all the personal preferences:\nrm -r ~/.config/vlc\n\nDo this while vlc is closed and you will have a brand new installation.\n", "Q: Is there a way to define a hotkey to solely unhide the Launcher? I'm running Ubuntu on Parallels Desktop for Mac, where I have some limitations regarding usage of the Super key (and also problems with mouse edge detection), for example, I've read on the web that holding Super for a while should bring a list of hotkeys, but for me holding it does nothing and on release just shows the Launcher with the Dash open and focused.\nHitting Super does the same, unhide Launcher with Dash focused. Hitting Super + w and holding Super I have the Launcher unhidden with the icons being numbered for shortcut access.\nWhat I'd like to have is just a hotkey, like there's for unhiding Launcher with Dash focused, but without the Dash focus, I'd like to have the Launcher unhidden as if the mouse was close to it, and if possible, kept it unhidden after hitting the hotkey until the hotkey got clicked again, which is the behavior of Launcher accompanied by Dash currently.\nNote that I'm not looking for a solution that would enable/disable auto-hide to pretend that the Launcher is being unhidden. This approach causes undesirable effects, the Launcher doesn't unhide, it just pops up suddenly, and occupies space, forcing rearrangement of icons in the desktop.\nEDIT\nI've tried other distros, like elementaryOS, and it doesn't present any issue with mouse edge detection for unhiding the Dock inside a Parallels VM... Sadly this seems like an Ubuntu/Unity specific issue.\n\nA: I have to recognize that is a very strange behavior what you asked. The best what can I do for you is to suggest you the following shell script (I named it (un)hide_launcher.sh):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nlauncher=$(gsettings get \\\n         org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ \\\n         launcher-hide-mode)\n\necho $launcher\n\nif [ $launcher -eq 1 ]; then\n    gsettings set \\\n    org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ \\\n    launcher-hide-mode 0\nelse\n    gsettings set \\\n    org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ \\\n    launcher-hide-mode 1\nfi\n\nMake the script executable from terminal with the following commands:\ncd /path/to/script/\nchmod +x (un)hide_launcher.sh\n\nTo set a (shortcut) key to run this script, go to System Settings... → Keyboard, select Shortcuts tab and click + sign to add a new custom shortcut key. For \"Name\" field add whatever you wish; for \"Command\" add the path to the script:\n\nThen click where is written \"Disabled\" to add a new accelerator and press your key combination (I chose F7).\nThe result:\n\n[Click to enlarge]\n\nA: Alt-F1 will unhide the Launcher and put it in keyboard navigation mode.  However, you can still use the mouse to select icons that are visible in the Launcher.  You can also use the up and down arrow keys to traverse the Launcher.  The downside is that you can't navigate down to any hidden icons with the mouse.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Kernel upgrade 3.5.0-39-generic prevents virtual box from running I just performed the kernel upgrade as part of the regular system upgrade.

Thank you :)\n\nA: This problem has been worked around in recent kernels; however, I'm not sure of the state of the kernel that Ubuntu 13.04 will install initially, so at the very least, you should immediately upgrade your kernel to the latest version.\nThis problem has been getting a lot of coverage here lately, but because the issue is fast-changing, older answers may be inaccurate.

I have two sound cards attached to my PC - an internal Soundblaster and an external DAC. Unfortunately, managing what to output where is a real pain. Just to give an example:\nWhen I enter the Phonon interface and set the DAC as the preferred device for ALL categories and then start Dragon Player, a message pops up saying \"Reverting to Soundblaster because it has higher priority\" (even though it obviously does not). \nAlso, it's really inflexible. The KDE mixer even has an option to adjust volume for individual programs using sound devices. I'd like to have similar functionality to switch, e.g. Amarok's output to card A and chromium's to card B.\nAre there any tools which make this possible in Kubuntu?\nIf all else fails - is the Gnome way of handling this problem more flexible and configurable?\n\nA: You can do this with pavucontrol . It is a GTK application, but don't worry, it works just fine in KDE. In combination with paman , it can be a very versatile controller for Pulseaudio.\n\nI use it for choosing where to record/play through, etc.\nUnfortunately, at this time I only have a single card to test on (and no HDMI devices), so a setup similar to yours, I can't test.\n\nYou can also try veromix , which can be used to move streams between devices, add effects, and more.\n\nA: With Gnome, you can install PulseAudio Manager which allows you to set priorities on sources and sinks.\nI am pretty sure that KDE also uses pulse audio so why not give it a try? The interface is in GTK but you should still be able to run it.\n\nA: Not sure of your version, but in the current KMix you can right click the Application stream volume, go to move, then assign it to a different card.

My laptop: http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/retail-product.jsp?poid=433212\nIf there aren't any comparability  or driver issues I'm considering installing Ubuntu. I think I still want Windows for some games and for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 C++. \nHow should I do this tough?\nMy preferred method is obviously have my OEM Windows back, but the disc costs $20 and I can't find a torrent anywhere.\nShould I install windows, create a 2nd partition, install Ubuntu on 2nd partition?\nShould I install Ubuntu and use Wine for windows applications, or is my computer too old?\nShould I install Ubuntu, create another partition, then install Windows?\nOr maybe there's a better way. \n\nA: If you really need to use windows then go for a 2 partitions. Using wine and/or virtualbox inside ubuntu will be ok for most of the cases, but heavy applications like games and visual studio, it will definitely be too slow.\n\nA: I've got Windows 7 dual booting with Ubuntu. IIRC I resized my windows partition without the need to reinstall windows, then created a second partition for Ubuntu. I think I used gparted running from a Linux live cd to do the partitioning, but not 100% sure. Was a little while ago. Take a look here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot for info on dual booting. It says you need your recovery CD, but that's probably only if things go wrong or for fixing the boot loader.\n\nA: the finding of windows torrent isn't that hard, but I guess it will be illegal to install it other than the test period. Other thing is that it isn't going to be oem, there are programs that can trick it into believing it is which leads to illegal.\nHere is my opinion, if your laptop came with rescue discs like my Toshiba A305-S6905 use them to freshen up your windows(not sure if it will do the trick), but backup your important data first. After that you can make a small partition for Ubuntu and make a dual-boot machine (look here for some info on dual-boot).\nIf you don't have rescue discs think what you want more and stick with it, for example you need to build a project with Visual Studio so better stay with windows.\n", "Q: view transmission status through cli I have installed transmission, and i have added a torrent to it, now how will i be able to view the details of the torrents.\ni have tried transmission-remote on local system. \nm@m-170:/home/m/$ transmission-remote -n transmission:transmission -st\n\nCURRENT SESSION\n  Uploaded:   None\n  Downloaded: None\n  Ratio:      None\n  Duration:   1 hour, 31 minutes (5478 seconds)\n\nTOTAL\n  Started 1 times\n  Uploaded:   None\n  Downloaded: None\n  Ratio:      None\n  Duration:   1 hour, 31 minutes (5478 seconds)\n\nand when i view my transmission gui it is currently downloading \nhow can i see the status, current download and upload speed\nand also add and remove torrents\nEdit:\ni have check an my default username and password is transmission\nso when i go here\nhttp://localhost:9091/\n\nand type username and password, i see the web interface of the transmission, but i dont see the current downloading in the gui.\nis there a way in transmission command line, that i can check what is in my gui and its status of my torrents\n\nA: I'm using transmission-remote-cli.

As you cannot use that system, you can try to recover it using a live cd.\nAfter booting from a live cd/usb, mount your root partition (you can use Nautilus of the mount command to do that).\nThen you should grab a copy of libc6 .deb. You can get it in http://packages.ubuntu.com/dist/libc6, where dist is your Ubuntu version (Precise, Quantal, Raring, etc). Double check you download the version that matches your architecture.\nAfter that just extract that .deb to your root partition. This is not equal to use apt-get install, but as you cannot use any command on that system...\nSupposing your root partition is mounted in /mnt, you can extract the .deb using\n$ sudo dpkg -x /path/to/libc6*.deb /mnt\n\nIf everything went well, you can unmount your root partition and reboot to check if your problem is solved.\nEdit\nAs pointed by fkraiem, after you got a working system you should run sudo apt-get install --reinstall libc6 to make sure libc gets correctly installed.   \n", "Q: Can I download music files that I own to another computer from Ubuntu One? I uploaded my music to Ubuntu One.  Can I download it as files to another computer?  \n\nA: Yes. If it's another Ubuntu computer then log into Ubuntu One on there and they should sync. If it's windows/mac then go to the Ubuntu One online and download from there!\n\nA: Sure you can. You can login to Ubuntu One's web interface from most any computer and download your files. Also, you can make the files public and share them with others by giving them the public link.\nMake sure you read the Ubuntu One terms of service, and also be careful you aren't violating any copyright laws by redistributing music you don't have the rights to. Those are the only limitations really, as there is no technical barrier for what you want to do.\n", "Q: Can't do anything with my iPad (3rd gen) using 13.04 I'm just trying to put new music on my iPad. I've tried to get iTunes to run using play on Linux as well as Wine. I've also tried to add music with both Banshee and Rhythmbox. I can't make anything work, but through libimobiledevice I am able to dock it and see the files, but nothing more. I'm sorry if this question has already been asked, but I can't find anything recent on the subject. Also I have an iPhone 4 and I'm experiencing the same issue with it. \n\nA: This question and it's answer talk about transferring video files between an iPad and Ubuntu via USB. \nThe process should be the same with audio, document and image files you will have to use a general file browser app from iTunes such as iFiles or FileBrowser. Both can handle various file formats.\nAdditionally iFiles has an in-built file server which can be accessed over the network.\nFileBrowser can access network shares.\nThere are many file manager applications in iTunes which can provide similar services.\nNote that I have no relation with either of the software mentioned above, it just happens to own both\n", "Q: Black screen during boot after TTY1 login I've got a weeks-young install of 13.04 (3.8.0.29) and the computer has been powered on for a week. I turned it off for the night and now it freezes during boot. \nI have already checked this seemingly mandatory post as well as this one but I couldn't find a solution. This one also looked promising but I can't get my machine into read/write mode because recovery isn't working and drop to shell only gives me a read-only system. Setting radeon.modeset=0 also ends in a freeze.\nAt this point, my computer is completely unusable and I have to run off a liveCD to write this question.\nHow can I identify the problem, and how can I solve it?\nThis is not an Nvidia problem, as the machine has a Radeon HD 5450 card. IIRC it's running with fglrx (not -updates and not built-in because then I wouldn't get my 1280x1024 resolution. \nAs far as I recall, I have not fiddled with any bits, certainly none at the system- or device level. I assume that installing user apps like Gimp can't have any impact.\nWhat happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*normal boot: brief purple screen, then a text-mode TTY1 login prompt flashes on just before Ubuntu (tries to) load the GUI. Except that now, the GUI doesn't arrive: the TTY1 text-mode screen disappears, there's an underscore cursor which does not blink, and then nothing more ever happens. Neither Ctrl-Alt-Del nor Ctrl-Alt-F2 or -F7 work. It seems frozen and requires a hardware reset.\n\n*recovery boot: the GRUB screens take a long time to show; I'm used to the sub-screens being shown instantly but now there's a delay of maybe 10-20 seconds before the \"advanced options\" screen is shown. No idea why, nor whether this is related to the boot problem.  \nAfter loading the recovery mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*several of the recovery options start out with FSCK, and I often get\nmountall: fsck /boot [1028] terminated with status 1\n\non the screen, and after that nothing more happens. Sometimes I get clean response instead, but still nothing more happens. Either way, the only keyboard input it will accept is Ctrl-Alt-Del but this does not reboot the machine right away! Instead I see a graphical notice the system is running in low-graphics mode although ironically, this message is displayed at 1600x1200 pixels which my monitor can't handle so it puts its own warning message in the middle and I can't see the rest of the GUI output. Then, before I can react, it reboots.\n\n*failsafeX has the same problem as the normal boot: it simply freezes after TTY1.\n\n*Hitting Ctrl-Alt-F1 or -F2 or -F7 at various stages doesn't do anything at all. This makes me think the machine is really frozen, rather than just working fine but without screen output.\n\n*editing GRUB's normal boot entry to remove splash quiet, and to add noapic nolapic nomodeset doesn't help either. Same situation. Same also when doing that on the recovery mode's boot entry.\n\n*Using the recovery mode to boot the previous kernel version (3.8.0.27) also has the exact same behavior.\n\nA: It turns out that reinstalling Ubuntu from scratch is quite fast and painless. Luckily I keep my /home/ on a separate hard disk so wiping the system disk was really inconsequential. It took less than half an hour (excluding optional data backups).\nUsing a DVI display cable might have improved things in the new installation, because the new install detected my monitor (the old one didn't) and set it up with the proper resolution, all with the default graphics drivers. \nThis pretty much rocks.\nIncidentally, reinstalling Ubuntu from a USB stick is dead-easy. There's even an option to install on top of the existing installation so as to not lose any installed programs and data. I tried that but probably pulled out the USB disk too early during reboot because the computer said the boot partition was damaged. But as I said, a clean install did the trick and was faster than messing around with mystic files and configurations that might have done more harm than good.\n\nA: Think Jakob provided the best answer, and for my money, the nouveau driver on Radeon on 13.04 is 10x better than the fglrx drivers. The ATI fglrx drivers were not so good with the last release, so dropped them like a rock. Never been happier than with the new open drivers. Much improved and use them at 1920x1080 with OpenGL and Compiz on Unity without issue.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04: Ethernet works at office but not at home. DHCP issue maybe? I am fairly new to Linux and just installed Ubuntu 13.04 on an external USB HD (using the liveCD). The computer the drive is connected to is a Dell Precision M4500 (laptop).\nAfter the fresh install, the wired Ethernet connection does not work when I am at home. However, when I go into my office and connect to the wired Ethernet network there, the wired connection does work.\nThe result is the same before and after the initial software updates. Also as another note, the wireless has never worked... it shows nearby wireless connections that are available but when I try to connect to them, I just get an authentication prompt over and over (or at home, there is no authentication prompt [WPA2 passcode is set], it just tries to connect and then fails and tries again in a loop). All that to say, when I go home later and check to see if there are answers, I will not have internet on the Linux machine.\nMy best guess is that it is a DHCP issue with Ubuntu but I have no idea where to begin. Please let me know what logs or other information is needed to diagnose (although without internet, it's a little hard to copy and paste).\nAs another note, when I boot the laptop into Windows 7, the wired connection works fine at home (not a bad router/cable... able to obtain an IP address, etc).\nThanks\n\nA: Try looking in /etc/network/interfaces. If your set up for dhcp then you should see something like this\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nBut if for some reason your set to a static IP then you'll see something more like this\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.100\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.1.0\n    broadcast 192.168.1.255\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nIf you're set up for static then edit the file to change back to dhcp using sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a laptop alongside Windows Vista? I have Windows vista 64 bit with a free D: drive that has nothing on it. \nHow do I install Ubuntu Dual Boot\nThe drive is formatted but did I do it right? How can I tell?\n\nA: You should install your Windows Vista. Next you should run Ubuntu form disc or pendrive and just install it. During the installation you will have check box \"Instal next to Windows Vista\".\nAnd that is pretty all you need to do :)\n\nA: I didn't quite understand what is the exact problem you are facing while installing. Using the Windows installer is probably the easiest way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows. You can get started with the instructions given here.

Now, when I restart my laptop, it pops up the GRUB menu thing, and I can load Ubuntu no problem. But if I try to select Windows, I get an error saying windows can't be booted, and I need the recovery disc to repair this. but, since I don't have one, I thought it'd be a good idea to look around the boot settings again. Changing the boot settings from Legacy back to UEFI lets me boot into windows normally, but there is no option to get into Ubuntu unless I change it back to Legacy, which locks me out of Windows again. My question is, how can I make these options bot available to me without having to mash f2 to get into the bios every time I want to change my OS? Thank you in advance.\n\nA: Although the symptoms are slightly different, the solution I offered to this question is likely to work for you.\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 12.04 running alongside windows 8.1 with no problems. I created the Ubuntu USB boot pen then, from within windows, I clicked restart while holding down shift. This presents different troubleshooting options. I selected boot from USB pen and the machine rebooted from the USB pen. In the BIOS settings (OK UEFI settings, I can't help saying BIOS as a generic term) boot mode was set to UEFI. As stated above, you can't mix the boot modes between operating systems.

One of the Pages contains a WebView.  While the WebView receives click events just fine, it doesn't receive drag events, as I would like it to.\nI assume the problem is that drag events are being trapped to provide navigation gestures for the WebView.  This isn't necessary:  The WebView is sized to exactly fill up the available space.  In the HTML displayed by the WebView, I set <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\">, to keep the WebView from allowing zooming.  The content is sized to fill up the viewport, so there's no need for scrolling.  But still, no drag events come through to the WebView.  What do I need to do to let them through?\nEdit to add: I've gotten reports that touch-and-drag works just fine; it's only mouse drag events that don't work.  That would be consistent with this post, which suggests that mouse handling in WebViews in QML is broken.\n\nA: I've been wrestling with the same problem, as webview seems very limited wrt drag events. In your case, since you say you need no scrolling nor zooming, then wouldn't a simple MouseArea inside the webview work? This is assuming your simply using webview for rendering and not general browsing. As an aside, I ended up using onChildrenRectChanged to capture any scrolling within the webview, kind of like a substitute for contentX, Y, Width, and Height, but this may or may not be relevant for you.\n", "Q: Resizing Partions with GParted So here's the situation:\nAfter installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Running df -h gives me the following partitions:\n/dev/loop0    ,    29G,  9.3G,   19G,  33%, /\n\nudev,            1.9G,  4.0K,  1.9G,   1%, /dev\n\ntmpfs,           771M,  892K,  770M,   1%, /run\n\nnone,            5.0M,     0,  5.0M,   0%, /run/lock\n\nnone,            1.9G,   15M,  1.9G,   1%, /run/shm\n\n/dev/sda2,       466G,   54G,  412G,  12%, /host\n\nWould it be possible to use GParted to resize my 466GB Windows 7 partition into a 300GB Windows 7 partition and a 166GB partition for media that Ubuntu can graft on as a sub-tree, leaving my Ubuntu system partition the same size and without having to reinstall Windows, i.e. grab 166GB worth of free space from the windows partition and add it to Ubuntu? (The issue is that I bought my laptop used, so I don't have the install CD.)\nIf so, does GParted automatically graft the partition on, or will I have to mount it? And what of the file system journalling? Will I have to manually configure that?\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! Of course, I'll back everything up beforehand just in case. Thanks. Apologies in advance if this question has been answered or is a duplicate; my knowledge of *NIX file systems is at an all time low...\n\nA: First of all to resize the system partition you have to unmount the partition, therefore you can't do it directly on the system, but you have to use a live cd (or usb). The ubuntu live cd is fine, otherwise you can use something like http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php\nThen you should make sure that the partitions to resize are adjacent.\nThe problem here is that you can't add anything to ubuntu partition since it does not exist because you probably used wuby (as said by oldfred)\n", "Q: Deleted files and folders to boot to Ubuntu - any way to retrieve files? I was cleaning up my E: drive, on which I downloaded Ubuntu (using Wubi), and I accidentally deleted the Ubuntu folder, and I also deleted some other files on my E: drive that I didn't recognize. The result of my action is that selecting to boot to Ubuntu results in the following message:\nWindows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:\n1. Insert your windows installation disc and restart your computer.\n2. Choose your language settings, and the click \"Next\".\n3. Click \"Repair your computer.\"\n\nIf you do not have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer manufacturer for assistance.  \n\nFile: \\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr  \nStatus: 0xc0000098  \nInfo: The selected entry could not be loaded because the application is missing or corrupt.  \n\nI read somewhere that the wubildr.mbr file may have been on the E: drive as well, rather than in the Ubuntu folder, as the above message suggests. I deleted every file that I didn't recognize that wasn't in a folder on my E: drive. So it's definitely gone, regardless. I also emptied the recycle bin. \nSo, here's the thing. I have some files that I saved to the Ubuntu desktop. And I very much need them back. Is there any way I can get them back? I am really hoping that it might be as simple as \"Click here to download the folder and files you foolishly deleted and simply place them on your E: drive\". I understand that that is unlikely. \nAny ideas? Suggestions? Or is it simply a loss that I'm going to have to accept?\n\nA: I was going to post this as comments, but seeing as it was going to be a series of long comments, and actually have some information in them, I decided to post this answer. I don't like posting answers that don't actually contain clear steps on how to solve an issue, but \"data recovery\" is not something that can easily be explained over the internet in a post like this; you'll need to do some reading of your own and explore the various tools.\n\n\"So it's definitely gone, regardless. I also emptied the recycle bin.\"\n\nTrust me, nothing is gone when you \"empty the recycle bin\" or Shift+Delete something; it's there, you just don't see it. Not to give you false hope though, because if you want any chance of completely recovering the stuff you deleted, stop using the computer now! Or at least, don't copy anything to and from the E partition. The more you use the E partition, the more your deleted folders are actually deleted.\nYou will need to try data recovery tools to recover your folder/files. There are several data recovery tools and guides for Windows on the internet that you can follow to retrieve the Ubuntu folder and the other files you deleted from your partition.\nUnfortunately, even though these \"data recovery\" tools do actually recover data, if you've already used the E drive a bit, you (and this is my speculation, but you) might not be able to fully recover the Ubuntu folder the way it was, so you might not be able to normally boot back into your Ubuntu as if nothing happened. I'm unfamiliar with what exactly is in the Ubuntu folder, so I'm not sure if you can somehow, from Windows, read the files inside the Ubuntu folder and be able to browse what was inside your Ubuntu installation without actually having to boot into it.\n\nI am really hoping that it might be as simple as \"Click here to download the folder and files you foolishly deleted and simply place them on your E: drive.\"\n\nYeaaaah...ehem...about that.\n", "Q: Gedit not displaying certain tabs I am using gedit to edit a ruby file.

What's the difference between installation from source (./configure && make && make install) and with apt-get?\nI can think of these: \n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get version usually is more stable and less choice, while we can chose the specific version when install from source.\n\n*apt-get can resolve dependencies automatically, can update/uninstall software easily, and has some other easy management goodness.\n\n*apt-get installation path follows a consistent pattern, and have some other conventions, which is convenient for SA.\n\n\nBut are there more?\n\n\n*\n\n*Can installation from source get better performance than via apt-get for some certain software, like php and mysql?\n\n*Some other differences?\n\n\nIn a word, in which condition should I chose installation from source than apt-get, except to get a specific version of that software?\nThanks.\n\nA: The difference is that apt installs generic binaries and manages their versions.\nWhen compiling a source package you are entirely on your own because apt cannot manage the package.\nHowever, compiling a source package and installing it yourself is useful if you need features that can be had only by compiling the package yourself.\nSometimes developers will provide features that can only be used in software if a certain compiler switch is used. And sometimes specific processors can perform better if certain compile flags are used.\nHowever, in most cases the features that can be enabled are for debugging purposes and will never be needed even by hard core users. And the binary version that apt is configured to use is already optimized for your processor.\nPossible situations where you would need to compile the source yourself would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a version of the software available that has features or fixes you need but the package hasn't been updated in your repository yet.\n\n*You're compiling the software to use on a computer with a different architecture.\n\n", "Q: Hibernate Ubuntu 13.04 Lenovo X1 I understand that the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 ultrabook supports hibernation, however I cannot work out how to get it working.

(suspend to RAM is faster and requires power ONLY to ram)?\nMore details:\npm-suspend\n           During suspend most devices are shutdown, and system state is saved\n           in RAM. The system still requires power in this state. Most modern\n           systems require 3 to 5 seconds to enter and leave suspend, and most\n           laptops can stay in suspend mode for 1 to 3 days before exhausting\n           their battery.\npm-hibernate\n           During hibernate the system is fully powered off, and system state\n           is saved to disk. The system does not require power, and can stay\n           in hibernate mode indefinitely. Most modern systems require 15 to\n           45 seconds to enter and leave hibernate, and entering and leaving\n           hibernate takes longer when you have more memory.\n\n\nNOTE: there is also a hybrid mode which is in between suspend to RAM and Disk.\n\nFind what states are supported by your laptop, for example (supports both to ram and disk):\ncat /sys/power/state\nmem disk\n\nYou can do it from command line anyway:\nOption 1: use pm-utils (need to install the package and user needs to have privilege to do suspend)\nSuspend to RAM: sudo pm-suspend\nHibernate (to Disk): sudo pm-hibernate \nOption 2: directly change sysfs (requires root privilege)\nSuspend to RAM: echo \"mem\" > /sys/power/state\nHibernate (to Disk): echo \"disk\" > /sys/power/state\nRefere to System Power Management State\n", "Q: python-uno : Depends: libreoffice-core (= 1:4.0.2-0ubuntu1) I have install libreoffice4.1 but when I try to install python-uno\nIt had error\nsudo apt-get install python-uno\nReading package lists...

But note that this wiki page was last updated in 2010 and some links aren't functional; also, the list of applications that \"work\" and those that don't may be different now with LibreOffice still being a prominent member of the latter. To quote another LibreOffice developer, Björn Michaelsen, \"since more and more other apps are using the workaround, we start to stick out\".\nThen, Ask Ubuntu also has information related to your question.

I downgraded libgcrypt11 to 1.5.0-3ubuntu2.1 but that doesn't resolve the problem for me.\nAnybody else having issues with this?\n\nA: For me the cause of VPN not working anymore was that my stored passwords where somehow wrong although I didn't change them.\nI found that out by starting NetworkManager VPNC in the shell using the following command (in Siduction, that is, but I guess it might be similar in Ubuntu):\nsudo /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-vpnc-service --debug\n\nThen I started the VPNC connection as usual via NetworkManager tray icon - the debug output can be seen on the console.\nFor me it showed (on the bottom):\n/usr/sbin/vpnc: hash comparison failed:  (ISAKMP_N_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED)(24)\ncheck group password!\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, and tried the downgrade of libcrypt11 ... fresh install of 14.04.2 LTS 64-bit, and so the downgrade was not in the repository and I had to download the deb and use dpkg to install it:\ncurl http://launchpadlibrarian.net/122471093/libgcrypt11_1.5.0-3ubuntu2.1_amd64.deb >lc.deb\nsudo dpkg -i lc.deb\n\nThe downgrade didn't work, however when I ran the client in debug mode:\nsudo /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-vpnc-service --debug\n\nI discovered that our Cisco server wanted a domain name (DNS, not Active Directory), which can be configured on the Advanced tab in Network Manager.\n\nA: I started having the same problem one day on Xubuntu 14.04.\nI've added the line Enable Single DES to the file /etc/vpnc/default.conf. This fixed it at first. Days later I had the same issue again. I tried removing that line and it worked again.\nI can't tell if something changed on the VPN server side or not to cause this, but that resolved it for me.\n", "Q: Why does /etc/issue show me Ubuntu and not Lubuntu? cat /etc/issue shows me \nUbuntu 13.04 \\n \\l\n\nbut I'm on Lubuntu 13.04. What is the purpose of /etc/issue? Also, what does \\n \\l in the output mean?\nThere's also issue.net which has just Ubuntu 13.04.\n(I know that echo $DESKTOP_SESSION gives me Lubuntu.)\n\nA: See the man page for issue:\n\nThe  file /etc/issue is a text file which contains a message or system identification to be printed before the login prompt.  It  may  contain  various @char  and  \\char sequences, if supported by the getty-type program employed  on the system.\n\nSo the following mingetty sequences can be used...\n\nTag Description\n\n\\d  insert current day (localtime),\n\\l  insert line on which mingetty is running,\n\\m  inserts machine architecture (uname -m),\n\\n  inserts machine’s network node hostname (uname -n),\n\\o  inserts domain name,\n\\r  inserts operating system release (uname -r),\n\\t  insert current time (localtime),\n\\s  inserts operating system name,\n\\u  The current number of users which are currently logged in\n\\U  Same as \\u but inserts \"n users\"\n\\v  Inserts operating system version (uname -v). \n\nAs far as /etc/issue goes and it showing Ubuntu: the file is not related to the desktop session and it is a text file you can manually change with vi or nano. \nCould be considered a bug if you did not change it yourself but it could also be considered a user file that should be left to the user to change.\n", "Q: Tata Photon 3g ZTE MF190 detected in Ubuntu 13.04 but not connected I'm using ubuntu 13.04.\nEarlier i used Huawei 2g internet dongle which worked fine.\nRecently I got TATA PHOTON 3g dongle which in ZTE MF190 model, it gets recognized and appears in my network panel on the top right corner but does not get connect.\nI already tried configuration through mobile broadband methoed.\nI'm unable to install wvdial offline.\nI appreciate any Resolution or Suggestion towards the same!!!\n\nA: Downloaded Sakis3g from http://sourceforge.net/projects/vim-n4n0/files/sakis3g.tar.gz/download and executed the script on the terminal.Followed the connection steps guided by the script and able to connect internet now through ZTE MF190 USB modem distributed by TATA PHOTON 3G - Thanks\n\nA: Since you changed dongle, you in fact added a second nic (network interface controller). The logical name of your first nic wil probably have been wlan0, the second nic will then have been named wlan1, the third nic wlan2 and so on. Connect the dongle you wish to use, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the following command: sudo lshw -c network. In the output check the logical name under the header Wireless interface. Now in your networkmanager change the logical name of the interface accordingly. \n", "Q: Run Java Programs residing on server I am using Ubuntu 12.04. I have uploaded a small java program (Hadoop Word Count) to a linux-server using FileZilla and now have to run that program onto server machine. I know how to connect to server using terminal i.e. ssh -l user-name ip-of-server But don't know how to run program that resides there. Please help me how to run that program from my machine.\n\nA: I believe what you need is to connect to the server this way:\nssh user@server -X\n\nWith the -X argument the session renders the graphical interface of the program in your client. \n\nA: You need a java compiler to compile your program before you run it to install the compiler, run the command apt-get install javac(assuming you are operating as root). You must  have your program saved with a .java extension. We will call it example.java .\nWhen all of the above is in place, use the command javac example.java to compile and then java example to run. When you compile, bash not giving you any response is a sign that the compiling succeeded without error.\nI have given this assuming you have used ssh to login to the server remotely\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.04 - can't see external ntfs drive I have upgraded from ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04 (x64) and from kde v4.10 to v4.11. Same kernel 3.8.\nSince the upgrade I have an issue with my Verbatim store'n go 500Gb usb external drive recognition, it takes a lot of time before recognize my external drive. I'll give you some more informations:\n\n\n*\n\n*it just happens with my external drive and it does not with my usb pen drives\n\n*it happens on ubuntu but it works well on windows 7 (windows 7 immediately recognizes the external drive as it does with other devices) so it's not related to my external drive\n\n*it's not related to my usb port because it's the same I use to connect the same external drive on windows 7\n\n*it doesn't happen with other external drives (so it's very strange now)\n\n*The same external drive was immediately recognized with ubuntu 12.10 \n\n*it's not related to the desktop environment because I have the same issue with unity\n\n*sometimes the drive is seen with 'sudo fdisk -l' but it's not recognized from the file manager (same thing with unity and kde)\n\n\nHow can I solve it?\nedit: \nhere is /etc/fstab:\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=QPawt31b\nand this it /proc/mounts: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Ub4F1XuW\nThanks\n\nA: It's seems (but not sure) that Ubuntu changes the way the devices are mounted now using subfolders for each user in /media\nSo if you launch Nautilus as root and see your files so just it's a matter of rights.\ntry this from a shell:\nsudo -i nautilus --no-desktop\n\n", "Q: ubuntu å vs osx å? Not sure if this is a ubuntu or osx question, but I'll start here. I'll leave it to the mods to move the question to AskDifferent if more apropriate.\nI moved a file from ubuntu to osx using scp on the apple machine.\nI edited the file on the apple machine.\nThen I moved the file back, again using scp on the apple machine.\nThe filename of the source file was Documents/trettiårsfirarätare.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sourcecode: Documents/trettiårsfirarätare\nThe filename I got back had the name Documents/trettiårsfirarätare.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sourcecode: Documents/trettia˚rsfirara¨tare\nWhile these might look similar, the letters å and ä is actually different between them. At no point did I change the name of the file.\nThis makes little technical difference to me, I just changed the name of the file back to what ubuntu considers å and ä, but it tickled my curiosity.\nCan you explain to me why this happened?\n\nA: In the original name “Documents/trettiårsfirarätare”, the letter “å” is internally represented as U+00E5 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE. This is the common representation of this character. In the filename you got back, it has been turned to the character pair U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A U+030A COMBINING RING ABOVE. This is permissible, but not common; it means decomposing “å” into the base character “a” and a combining diacritic mark. These representations are declared to be canonically equivalent in Unicode; this means that the visual presentation is normally expected to be the same, but it need not (here, at SO, as viewed in Firefox, it is not – this depends on font and on rendering software). Programs may treat them as equivalent, but they need not. In a file system, for example, they might well be treated as different.\nSimilarly, the letter “ä” gets decomposed to U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS.\nThe reason to this is not obvious. Possibly some software “thinks” it should convert strings to a normalization form that decomposes all decomposable characters, probably Unicode Normalization Form D (NFD)\nThe rest is a bit more mysterious. What you specify as “Sourcecode” for the filename you got back, “Documents/trettia˚rsfirara¨tare”, the decomposed forms have been munged: the diacritic marks have been replaced by their spacing clones, the characters “˚” and “¨”. This is not normal, and it changes both the identity of data and its rendering. \n", "Q: agent-state-info: 'hook failed: \"config-changed\" deploy wordpress using juju I have one virtual machine on Windows Azure.\nI have installed juju inside my virtual machine.\nI want to deploy wordpress on my vm.

This typically occurs due to one a few things\n\n\n*\n\n*A charm bug\n\n*Missing configuration options\n\n*a \"hiccup\" during hook execution\n\n\nTo start you will need to collect some information about your currently executing operation in the debug logs. Under production environments (like aws, hpcloud, etc) you run juju debug-log -n 500 however, since you're running the local provider this will be located in \n$HOME/.juju/local/logs/unit-wordpress-0.log\n$HOME/.juju/local/logs/unit-mysql-0.log\n\nThe format of the log files is fairly straight forward, and should you require additional help parsing them, upload it to paste.ubuntu.com and we can go through the logs either in #Juju on IRC or update the question.\nUsually when an error is encountered due to corner cases, or race conditions, you can resolve the error and retry hook execution by running juju resolved -r <service>/<unit>\nso in the example of your mysql hook failure, juju resolved -r mysql/0 will re-run the failed hook and if it completes successfully, the service will continue deployment.\n", "Q: My computer refuses to use my NVIDIA driver I find this sort of issue everywhere, however I have been at this for just about two weeks and really need to fix this, as I need the functionality of my NVIDIA Geforce GT 540m. \nRunning an external monitor via HDMI (1920x1080) and using my laptop screen (1366x768) as my secondary screen. \nMy process: \nDownload the driver from Nvidia's site; Linux x64 for GT540m.

Optimus is an nVidia technology used on laptop for saving energy: the concept at its core is that when you're not using accelerated applications the integrated non-accelerated video chip (usually an Intel graphic card) is used, while the nVidia GPU is turned on only when necessary. \nProblem is that nVidia still does not really support Optimus technology on Linux: simply installing the nVidia drivers as you tried to do won't work because of the hardware architecture of this \"hybrid\" nVidia cards.\nOne thing you can do is use Bumblebee which enables Optimus support on laptops (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee) and should help with dual-monitor configuration (see http://blog.linuxacademy.com/linux/ubuntu-bumblebee-optimus-and-multi-monitor-support/)\n\nA: The simplest way to ensure best possible performance with NVIDEA cards is to install the Steam client from valve and ask it to run Team Fortress 2 (huge download but free).\nIt then guides you to get your NVIDEA card up and running with the latest drivers good enough for gaming.  \n(You may get the diagnostics without downloading the game, but I am not certain).\n\nA: the link below is how i installed my nvidia driver. its easy to do but nvidia will always be on.\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/08/install-upgrade-nvidia-319-49-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Multi-monitor setup, only terminal on one monitor I currently have three monitors hooked up to my computer.

After that how can I remove Ubuntu permanently from my computer and still keep my old operating system and data?\n\nA: Setting up a dual boot would be the best thing to do in my opinion. You can create an extra partition and install Ubuntu on the new partition without touching your old OS. When you want to remove Ubuntu, you can simply format that partition again. The only thing you'll need is a recovery disk of your old OS to reset the bootloader since Ubuntu will install Grub.\nMake sure to backup your data before making new partitions.\nMore information is in the Ubuntu Documentation Windows Dual Boot wiki.\nMore information on resetting the bootloader when you remove ubuntu: How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on?\n", "Q: USB memory stick not working any more I have one USB memory stick (FAT32) that I was using on Ubuntu.

I Tried googling it.\n\nA: Virtual Box does not need DKMS to install but with DKMS the kernel modules will be reinstalled after a kernel upgrade.\nAfter a fresh install it is always a good idea to perform an update of all packages for bugfixes (you have 182 package in the queue there):\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen you may have to load the virtualbox kernel modules only if you had removed DKMS from the default installation.\nIf this did not resolve your issue you may have installed an incompatible version of Virtual Box still. This needs to be purged before we can install an up to date version. Removing Virtual Box depends very much on how you had installed it in the first place. You may have to run e.g.\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox\n\nor\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox-<xxx> # replace <xxx> with the version installed\n\nAfter that we can re-install the latest version of virtualbox as depicted in the answer below (I recommend the latest bugfix release from Oracle rather than the version from the repositories):\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install the VirtualBox version from Oracle to install an Extension Pack?\n\nA: First of all, you have to remove wrong repository:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.li\n\nThen, upgrade your system \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.li\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nRun these commands for update your OS.\nThe fololowings for install dkms and set for vboxdrv:\nsudo apt-get install dkms\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\n\nA: Adding to Takkat answer, you have a malformed file name in your /etc/souces.list.d. The best way to solve this is not deleting the file, but renaming it:\nsudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.li /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis will take away the N: Ignoring file 'virtualbox.li' in directory '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/' as it has an invalid filename extension line, and also will upgrade your 183 packages.\n", "Q: What are the plataforms/devices Ubuntu touch will run from?

After searching for almost a month for the solution (still unsolved), asking here with a lot of hope.\nBackground:\nI have a Bravia TV which is connected to my HP computer running Ubuntu 12.04 dual booted with Windows 7. Desktop is having no HDMI port, instead one DIVX and one VGA port. The VGA port is connected to a small monitor and the DIVX port connected to TV with HDMI at the TV end. A male-male 3.5 audio connector connects the audio input port at TV and rear headphone jack at desktop.\nPurpose:\nI want to view movies stored in my HDD over my big screen TV.\nProblem:\nWhen I am in Windows, I switch screen from my monitor to TV and view movies, no issues. But now I want to phase out Windows with Ubuntu but only this problem is restricting me. I can switch displays but no sound is coming. First the audio drivers were not present, installed them, checked with headphones and 5.1 speakers, audio is coming but I want it through my TV. Strange thing is that if I unplug my DIVX port, the sound is coming through TV, screen obviously blank and display is coming through my small monitor.\nAlternatives:\nIf I use audio from my home theatre and display from TV, it solves my purpose, but then I am not utilizing my TV speakers and going towards more electricity bills. I also tried the DLNA way (my TV and Ubuntu desktop is connected to the same router/network) using miniDLNA, Plex, Serviio etc. but each is having some or the other problem.\n\nA: Maybe Ubuntu sets the wrong output. Try the following.\nConnect your PC to the TV. Then go to Sound settings:\n\nYou'll be presented with the following screen:\n\nFrom the Play sound through select the output device corresponding to your audio jack. The list will be different from the one in the picture above, but if you can't figure out which one the right one you may just try them all (should be something like Analog Stereo Output).\nAlso be sure that the Output volume slider is not zeroed.\n\nA: To quote your response:\n\"If I plug-out the tv audio jack and put my headphone jack in, can hear a female voice saying front left/front right etc. \"\nThat being the case, you do have output from the computer so I would check the Sony Bravia audio settings.  There might be something there to switch on.\nGood Luck\n", "Q: How can I run a command and copy its output? I've been asked to run a command and copy and paste the output but I have no idea where to start.\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: Hopefully you will have access to a graphical desktop. That's what the first part of this answer deals with. If you do not, skip the first three steps and read the bottom of the answer.\nStep 1: Load a terminal...\nThe first step is opening a terminal. There are a multitude of different terminal options out there but most Ubuntu users will have gnome-terminal, KDE users tend to have konsole, and XFCE users should have xfce4-terminal.\nOnce you have identified which command you want to run, it's just a case of running it.\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Unity and Gnome Shell users can search for Terminal.\n\n*KDE users can find Konsole under Applications → System.\n\n*All desktops can press Alt+F2 and type in the terminal binary name (as above) manually.\n\nStep 2: Running your command\nThis is the simple bit. You should be looking at something like the following:\n\nYou can either type the command, or you can copy it (select the text, right click, \"Copy\", then right click the terminal, \"Paste\"). Copy & Paste is recommended for long commands. We want to avoid errors in transcription!\nWhen you have typed or pasted the command into this window, press Return. Output should now appear on the screen as below:\n\nStep 3: Copying the content\nCopying is similar to most other applications apart from most consoles only know how to copy \"blocks\". To copy, simply use your mouse to drag around the output until it is highlighted, like so:\n\nRight click on the terminal (to go to the Edit menu) and select \"Copy\". Then you can go back to your browser or editor and paste. We're done.\nStep 3.5: Alternative for copying:\nSeeing as you're getting the hang of the command line now, you can also use a command called xclip to directly insert things into X's clipboard. This will only work if a GUI is running.\nlspci -nnk | grep VGA -A1 | xclip -selection clip\n\nNote: you can omit -selection clip but the data will be in your middle-click clipboard - yes, there are two clipboards... A story for another day, perhaps :)\n\nAddendum: Extracting command line data without Copy & Paste\nIf you need to get the output from a computer that, for example, the display settings are so broken you can't get into a usable desktop, we have to find another method for extracting the output. You could do it by hand but often (in case of logs) this is impractical.\nAt the very least we need to get into a terminal which you can do by pressing: Control+Alt+F1.\nYou may need to log in.\nFrom here we can run our command but the output will only show on the display. Now we have two options:\nI have an internet connection\nIf you have access to the internet, you can simply \"pipe\" the output into a command called pastebinit. This uploads the content to http://paste.ubuntu.com and returns a short, easy to transcribe URL that you can access from another computer or just give to people.\npastebinit is not installed by default so the first thing we run is:\nsudo apt-get install pastebinit\n\nThen we run our command, followed by | pastebinit:\nlspci -nnk | grep VGA -A1 | pastebinit\n\nAnd you'll see something like the following (though obviously not in a window):\n\nWrite down the URL and you can share that with whomever you like.\nI don't have an internet connection\nThis is more problematic but not unsurpassable. We will need some form of external storage. A USB stick is a popular example. Plug it in. In a non-graphical setting, USB drives are not automatically mounted. As I said, problematic.\nRun lsblk and you should see something like this:\nNAME              MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT\nsda                 8:16   0 111,8G  0 disk  \n├─sda1              8:17   0   100M  0 part  /boot\n├─sda2              8:18   0     1G  0 part  /\n├─sda3              8:19   0    20G  0 part  /usr\n├─sda4              8:20   0     1K  0 part  \n├─sda5              8:21   0  58,7G  0 part  \n└─sda6              8:22   0    32G  0 part  [SWAP]\nsdb                 8:96   1  14,5G  0 disk  \n└─sdb1              8:97   1  14,4G  0 part\nsr0                11:0    1   4,4G  0 rom   \nsr1                11:1    1  1024M  0 rom   \n\nIn my case, the new disk I've plugged in is that second one (sdb) and it has one partition (sdb1). We need to mount this so we can write to it. Simply:\nsudo mount -o umask=0000 /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\nThen we can funnel our commands into new files on the external disk:\nlspci -nnk | grep VGA -A1 > /mnt/lspci\ncat /var/log/Xorg.0.log >/mnt/xorg.log\n\nThat will create two new files on the external drive. You can also copy things to it with cp. When you're done you want to unmount the drive:\ncd /  # just in case you cd'd into /mnt\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nThen you can unplug your drive and take it to another computer and upload the information as requested.\n\nA: By \"paste the output\" they meant to share the output on a pastebin site. For example, if the command was ls you could send it to dpaste.com like this:\nls | curl -s -F \"content=<-\" https://dpaste.com/api/\n\nTranslation: \"Run the ls command; pipe its output to curl, which will post it to the dpaste.com API in a field labeled \"content\".\nThat curl command will return the URL of the pastebin item you've created.\n", "Q: Grep Regex match not returning result as expected I have several Ubuntu servers and there is some behavior that has me curious.\nOn any newly installed machine (Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 LTS), if I run:\necho \"testbla123\" | grep -P -o [0-9]*\n\nThis will return 123 as expected.\nOn an older machine (Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS), if I run the same command, I get nothing back, I have to instead run:\necho \"testbla123\" | grep -P -o \"[0-9]*\"\n\nAfter performing an apt-get upgrade, it will perform without quotes around the regex.\nGrep is at the same versions on both machines. I tried comparing dependencies before and after the update for some time without much luck.\nI was wondering if anyone knows why this happens?\n\nA: Chances are you have a file that matches the glob pattern [0-9]* on your second machine, and not on the first one. If that's the case, the shell will expand the glob into the file's name before passing that as an argument to grep.\nIf there is no file that match on the current directory, the shell leaves the glob pattern untouched and passes it as-is to the command.\n$ echo abc123 | grep -P -o [0-9]*\n123\n$ touch 234\n$ echo abc123 | grep -P -o [0-9]* # shell runs grep -P -o 234\n$ touch 123\n$ echo abc123 | grep -P -o [0-9]* # shell runs grep -P -o 123 234\n$ rm 234 123\n$ touch 12\n$ echo abc123 | grep -P -o [0-9]* # shell runs grep -P -o 12\n12\n$ \n\nAlways quote parameters that contain shell wildcards if you don't want them to be expanded by the shell.\n", "Q: Why am I getting \"apt-setup/security_host ubuntu doesn't exist\" while instaling from pressed?

Thanks, berga007\n\nA: It sounds like a caching problem to me, depending on the changes you're making. If you're making CSS or JS changes, then, yes, it's probably caching the page. Then, when you go to a different URL, your browser is pulling a \"new\" page. If you are changing CSS or JS, here's an article from Mozilla about clearing your cache in FF. http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache\nIf you're making other changes (such as changing the wording or layout), it may be something else.

Please help me, how can I correctly install and run Packet Tracer.\nNote that I'm new in using Linux.\n\nA: You probably did not follow the correct procedure. For one: nowhere does it state you need to rename the file to an extension that claims it is a compressed archive. This is one method that works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-download Cisco Packet Tracer 6.0 for Ubuntu.\n\n*Open up Downloads folder, rename to CiscoPacketTracer6.0.\n\n*Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t).\n\n*Type in:\nsudo su\n\nAnd type in your password and press Enter.\n\n*Then type:\ncd Downloads\nls\nchmod +x CiscoPacketTracer6.0\n./CiscoPacketTracer6.0\n\n\n*Next, click the space bar to go to the bottom (You'll see a % at the bottom left of terminal) of the EULA and press the y button to accept the terms and conditions. \nAfter that, sit back and wait until it's done. \n\n*Next, click on Ubuntu symbol and search \"Packet\" on your computer. You should see the Cisco Packet Tracer 6.0 icon. Right mouse click on that and packet tracer should open. \n\n\nIf this does not work please edit your answer and PM me. \nThe installer puts its files into:\n/usr/local/PacketTracer6/\n\nThe executable is:\n/usr/local/PacketTracer6/bin/PacketTracer6\n\nSo you can also create a link in /usr/local/bin to be able to run from the command-line:\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/PacketTracer6/bin/PacketTracer6 /usr/local/bin/\n\nFinally, for reference, to find the path and arguments used when a program was run from the gui, you can use: ps auxfwww | less.\n\nA: This is how I installed Packet Tracer 6.0.1 on Ubuntu 13.10:\nDownloaded \"Cisco Packet Tracer 6.0.1 for Linux - Ubuntu installation (no tutorials)\" from the cisco's www.netacad.com website.\nYes, it doesn't have an extension.\nI made a copy of it and renamed PT601.tar.gz\nI chose a short name just for ease of use and the extension should be .tar.gz.\nOpen a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t)\ncd \"location of the PT601.tar.gz\"\n\nFor example:\ncd /home/Downloads\nsudo chmod a+x PT601.tar.gz\nbash ./PT601.tar.gz\n\nIt took me a few days being beginner on Linux, and Cisco didn't give any instructions.\nHopefully this will help a few people getting by with Packet Tracer 6.0.1 on Ubuntu 13.10.\n\nA: As you have downloaded Cisco Packet Tracer 6.0.1 for Linux, don't change its extension but change its name to use commands easily, let's say you have changed it's name to xxx.bin and its under home directory-\nPress Ctrl+Alt+t to open a terminal and then change the permission for that file by using the following command:\nchmod +x xxx.bin\n\nand run \n./xxx.bin\n\nand after that press spacebar, and then y for yes and provide your password.\nIf you are using 64 bit System Architecture, you have to install ia32-libs by running:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs-gtk\n\nIf you are not sure about the Architecture use:\narch\n\nor \nuname -m\n\nThe downloaded file would be of approximately 77Mbs.

I just changed around the partition table of an Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop and everything seems to be working fine. I want to perform similar changes on another (more important) system. \nThe machine boots so I'm guessing everything worked well.\nIs there a more comprehensive way to check that the partition table is ok and the filesystem is consistent?\n\nA: If you have a MBR partition table, you can use fdisk:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis command will print out the partition table and will also automatically perform some consistency checks. If instead you have a GPT partition table, you can use gdisk (thanks Rod Smith for pointing that out):\nsudo gdisk /dev/something\n\nwhere /dev/something is the path to your disk device file (e.g. /dev/sda). From the gdisk interface you will be able to press v to run consistency checks.\n\nAbout the filesystem, there are many ways to perform the check, the one I prefer is this:\nsudo touch /forcefsck\n\nThis way, once you reboot the computer, the filesystem is checked for errors. This is a nice way of doing it because you don't need to worry about the dangers of running fsck.\nIt's worth noting that the file /forcefsck will be automatically deleted as soon as the check has completed.\n\nA: You can use the fsck command.  Make sure to execute the fsck on an unmounted file systems to avoid any data corruption issues.\nJust press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nfsck /dev/sdaX\n\nMake sure to replace the X with you device number.\nThe following are the possible exit codes for fsck command.\n0 – No errors\n1 – Filesystem errors corrected\n2 – System should be rebooted\n4 – Filesystem errors left uncorrected\n8 – Operational error\n16 – Usage or syntax error\n32 – Fsck canceled by user request\n128 – Shared-library error\n\nYou may also take a look at 10 Linux Fsck Command Examples to Check and Repair Filesystem\nSource:fsck Man Page\n", "Q: TexLive Version used by TexStudio I have installed texlive 2013 over the internet. \nI followed the documentation given along with it to set the PATH variables post installation.

Access to the Web Proxy filter is denied.  ).\n\nI have no GUI (no X) on this PC.\nHow can I make a simple http request and bypass this proxy?\n\nA: For having authentication with wget you can use:\nwget --proxy-user=user --proxy-password=pass http//someurl.com/file\n\nIf you want to set this as variable in the profile use:\nexport http_proxy=\"http://username:password@proxy.domain:8080\"\n\nThose are all you need. Of course, you should have a username:password for this proxy.\nYou could add the last line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile or any script that executes at starting a prompt. If you want only wget knowing of this, you should modify ~/.wgetrc (only for the user) or /etc/wgetrc (globally for all the users) and add:\nproxy_password = pass\nproxy_user = user\n\n", "Q: Give Apache2 write permissions network share I have just installed ownCloud.

You can be the ownner of a file, but you may not have read/write access to that file.\n\nA: I have solved this by now.\nThe solution was to edit the fstab file. \nIn there I had to give the extra parameters:\ngid=www-data\nfile_mode=0770\ndir_mode=0770\n\nThis gave the group www-data write permissions.\n", "Q: icon of the .desktop file does not show in unity launcher I created the launcher for the Ranger filemanager like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=true\nIcon[pl_PL]=/\nName[pl_PL]=Ranger\nExec=/usr/bin/ranger\nName=Ranger\nIcon=/home/yemu/.icons/Ranger.png\n\nUnfortunately, the icon only shows on the .desktop file, but after I run it, in the launches there's default grey icon with gear instead of the ine defined in the file.\n\nA: I'm self posting the answer I found on the internet, here's my desktop entry, temporarily using baobab icon, but I hope I'll manage to change that. ranger shows up as an indepentent app, and I can swith to it with Super+Number, and that's mainly the thing I wanted to achieve.

I found on internet that uninstallation of unity-lens-music package will solve this issue. What I want to know is what unity-music-daemon does.

Can anybody explain what this daemon does?\nThank you.\n\nA: I am far from an expert on the topic but given that no one with more knowledge on it has answered I will try to provide a very rough idea to you.\nAs far as I understand \"lens\" is the generic term for the search functionality of the Ubuntu Dash (Dash being the thing that appears when you click the upper-left corner in the default installation). So, you can have a Wikipeda lens for example which will allow you to search for Wikipedia related information using the Dash. \nOn the other hand daemons are processes that run on the background and take care of having your system running smoothly and up to date (as far as my knowledge goes). \nWith this two things above we can state that unity-music-daemon takes care of keeping the data-based updated and running smoothly for music related queries.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for \"find in page\" I'm keybinding some shortcuts and I just want to know what the \"find in active window\" command is, ie the Ubuntu equivalent of Ctrl+F in Windows.\n\nA: Each application has set their keybindings separately, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome-terminal uses Ctrl + Shift + F for the search function. (only text)\n\n*gedit uses Ctrl + F (only text)\n\n*nautilus uses Ctrl + F (only files)\n\n*Others applications have set their own keybinding.\n\n\nThere isn't a central option to set such keybindings, the same happens in Windows ecosystems.

So you may need to create a new account first before deleting the old one.\nTo get rid of the encryption only I would try looking at /home/.ecryptfs, that's where the encrypted home is (see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome).\nMoving /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/ to some other place (to make the change reversible) might work (can't try right now, don't have an encrypted home).\nBut that won't change the passphrase of your user, you would still need to do that.\n", "Q: Intel Driver Manager Error \"Package libdrm2:i386 cannot be removed\" I recently fresh-installed ubuntu 13.04.

I couldn't do that because the PPA Wasn't keyed right for the download.01.org package. So looking on the website, they offered the following:\nSignatures - Ubuntu*\nIn order to \"trust\" the Intel® Linux Graphics Installer, you will need to add keys to Ubuntu's software package manager (\"apt\"). Open a terminal, and execute these line:\nwget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg -O - | \\\nsudo apt-key add -\n\nwget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/gfx/RPM-GPG-KEY-ilg-2 -O - | \\\nsudo apt-key add -\n\nNow, to update the packages. So\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow that we have the updates, we upgrade\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nNow that probably did it, but we want to be sure. So I ran the Intel Graphics Drivers Manager. This time, it worked.\n", "Q: Disable network on remastered Ubuntu 13.04 Live-CD except for localhost I have remastered a Ubuntu 13.04 Live-CD for software presentations. During boot, it tries to find a network connection for several minutes (but fails in the end). Maybe it does not detect my network card properly (MacBook Pro). For the live system I don't need an internet connection. Only access to localhost is important.\nHow do I prevent the system from configuring the network/internet connection while still preserving access to localhost? \nIf I can not turn this off, is it possible to reduce the timeout for this configuration process?\nEDIT: I forgot to say that I used a minimal Ubuntu 13.04 with command line only. Hence, no GUI components are responsible for the delay.\nEDIT 2: The /etc/network/interfaces of the Live-DVD before remastering is\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n\nA: I assume it is searching for a wireless access point. Normally, Network Manager will not look for an ethernet connection if it can't detect a cable. I suggest you determine the wireless driver from the terminal command:\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nIn many MacBooks, the driver will show as b43-pci-bridge. If this is your case, you actually want b43. Blacklist the wireless driver you found:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAdd a new line at the end:\nblacklist driver\n\n...where driver is the wireless driver you found in lshw.\nThen remaster.\n\nA: I solved it by editing /etc/init/failsafe.conf, which contained the messages and the delays:\n# failsafe\n\ndescription \"Failsafe Boot Delay\"\nauthor \"Clint Byrum <clint@ubuntu.com>\"\n\nstart on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=lo\nstop on static-network-up or starting rc-sysinit\n\nemits failsafe-boot\n\nconsole output\n\nscript\n    # Determine if plymouth is available\n    if [ -x /bin/plymouth ] && /bin/plymouth --ping ; then\n        PLYMOUTH=/bin/plymouth\n    else\n        PLYMOUTH=\":\"\n    fi\n\n    # The point here is to wait for 2 minutes before forcibly booting \n    # the system.

It might also be possible to remove the sleep commands. This does not necessarily disable the network interfaces, but reduces the time for the system trying to find a connection.\n", "Q: Where do I find my boot menu? I want to know where the boot menu is on my ASUS laptop.  Can anyone tell me where to find it or where to find my BIOS settings?

Nautilus 3.4 allows you to set a default view mode.

Going through each and every folder to change the view mode manually would take too long.\nIs there any way I can do this? Maybe through a Nautilus script that modifies gvfs-metadata?\n\nA: Overview\nTo find the metadata for a folder you need to use the command gvfs-info foldername\nfor example gvfs-info /home/homefolder/Desktop\nIn the list that returns you will see the attribute metadata::nautilus-default-view which describes the default view.\nYou can change this attribute using the command gvfs-set_attribute foldername attribute newvalue\nfor example:\ngvfs-set-attribute /home/homefolder/Desktop \"metadata::nautilus-default-view\" \"OAFIID:Nautilus_File_Manager_Icon_View\"\n\nScript\nNow I have to admit my bash scripting skills aren't the best, but here you go - my script below will allow you to reset all the views below the folder-name given.\nSyntax:\nfolderreset [OPTION] full_base_directory_name\n\nfor example this will reset to compact view all folders below /home/homefolder/Desktop\nfolderreset -c /home/homefolder/Desktop\n\nuse folderreset -h for the syntax.\nFeel free to tinker and amend.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Licensed under the standard MIT license:\n#Copyright 2013 fossfreedom.\n#Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n#The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n#THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

I'm following the directions to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode and have tried disabling SecureBoot and all that stuff. I don't think I can turn off Intel SRT because I currently run a RAID array and doing so would result in a loss of data for me.\nAnyhow, onto the actual issue at hand. I can successfully select the USB drive as the primary boot device and I get to the page that asks whether I want to try Ubuntu or Install it or do the OEM option and so on. So I get that far, but when I select to try Ubuntu without installing, it goes to a black screen and it appears to quit reading from the USB stick and nothing is displayed on screen. Does anyone have an idea why this is happening?\nEdit: I do want to add that my laptop has all USB 3.0 ports, if that makes a difference.\n\nA: I just bought an MSI GS70, 2 ssd configuration. I managed to get Ubuntu 12.04.3 dual boot working, here are the steps I took.\n\n\n*\n\n*Access BIOS, either by hitting DEL while the computer is starting, or through Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Secure Boot Control -> Disabled\n\n*Set Boot Mode -> Legacy\n\n\n*Boot from the Ubuntu USB and proceed to install Ubuntu normally. Personally, I did the easiest thing I could and simply installed Ubuntu on a partition of the 1TB hard drive. This was to avoid dealing with Raid 0 hassles.\n\n*At this point, even though Ubuntu had correctly installed, I couldn't boot into Ubuntu. I completed the remaining steps with the USB Ubuntu trial.\nThis is still in Legacy mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Boot-Repair: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\n*Follow the steps and run Boot-Repair, I just hit forward / complied with all boot-repair commands until it finished.\n\n\n*Restart your computer, hit DEL repeatedly to access the BIOS and switch the boot mode back to UEFI.\n\n*Restart once again and hopefully you should see grub. Everything should be in working order.\nGoodluck!\n\nA: I have the exact same problem on my Toshiba Satellite S50-A. In my case the problem is definitely related to UEFI; if I configure the firmware for \"CSM Boot\", aka legacy BIOS mode, the USB drive boots normally.\nThe one partial solution that I have found is this: If I disable \"Built-in LAN\" in the setup utility, the Live USB will boot as expected in UEFI mode. Of course, then the ethernet adapter is completely disabled. In my case, I only use WiFi, so it is an acceptable sacrifice. (Thanks to user oldfred who provided this suggestion in response to my own question.)\nI'm not sure why Built-in LAN is a problem or what is the proper solution.\n", "Q: How to develop for Ubuntu?

It is a Voyo A15. It is not supported by CyanogenMod, but there is a Custom ROM available for this tablet. I would want to install Ubuntu Touch on it.\nMy question: Would it be possible to port Ubuntu Touch to this device? Considering it has the same SoC as the Nexus 10. I have enough Linux experience (of building kernels etc.), so I could do (at least try to do) the porting myself. The manufacturer has not yet released the source for their ROM, but the drivers for the Exynos chip are available. The Exynos is not the only chip on the tablet, so if the manufacturer doesn't release those drivers, is it still possible?\nMaybe this is not the right place to ask this question, should I try at CyanogenMod forums? Maybe there is someone with experience of porting CyanogenMod/UbuntuTouch to exotic Android Tablets?\n\nA: As of now it looks impossible to build without CM10.1\nUbuntu touch uses following parts from android,\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Kernel (stock Android kernel provided by the vendor, with a few changes to support some extra features needed by Ubuntu)\n\n*OpenGL ES2.0 HAL and drivers\n\n*Audio/Media HAL and services, to re-use the hardware video decoders\n\n*RILD for modem support\n\n\nIf you get hold of these then you can start working on it. Here is the complete guide\nLater point of time, it will be possible to run ubuntu without android. It may get easy (or difficult) for your device later.\n\nA: Doesn't need to be in CyanogenMod. You need Android 4.1 and above (jellybean) and ClockworkMod. Hope that helps. CyanogenMod 10 is also 4.1+.

On Ubuntu 12.04, using Thunderbird, everything up to date.\nWhenever mail arrives, I get notification in right hand top part of the screen. The notification is somewhat similar to what outlook shows in right bottom panel. If I mouse over it, it stays there,  greyed out and not readable, but it's not clickable. \nWhat purpose does this solve? The reason I am moving mouse over it so that I can read it and hope to keep it little longer to give me a chance, but it's not readable. I can not click on it as it not clickable. If mouse moves out, it becomes readable again.\nCan I configure something (don't know what) so that I can click on the notification, it can open thunderbird and take me to the mail or at least make it more readable.\n\nA: The purpose of the notifications is, well, to notify you. Nothing else. Once you receive the notification you go to the corresponding indicator (in the top right) and open it. In this case you would go to the little envelope icon. \nYou don't need to put the mouse over it: just read it and make use of that information. If you put the mouse over the notification bubble, it blurs so you can easily read or interact with what's under it.\nAnother side effect of putting the mouse over the notification is that it will last longer to fade away. You might need this if there's a lot of text to be read, too much text could be considered bad design, though. The correct way to respond to a notification is to just open the associated application/status icon.\nRead on Notifications, indicators and alerts to see Mark's thinking when the concept was considered. Also, you might find useful to read How to customize on screen notifications?\n\nA: No, you can't. That notification is just a notification and you cannot do anything else with it. And also, unfortunately, cannot be configured somehow. The single purpose that I can see is that it provides you a... notification.\n", "Q: Empty Trash sound event? Is there any way to add a sound event every time I empty the trash on my Ubuntu system?\n\nA:  Empty Trash Sound Workaround\n      for Ubuntu 12.04.3\nMaybe you will find my idea useful. \n   After 2 months of searching for a solution to get a trash-empty sound\n   in Ubuntu 12.04.3 I finally was able to put together something that works for me.\nIf anyone has an improved solution then please share.\nYou will note in the script below that I have chosen to use the \"music123\" app\nwhich can be downloaded from the Ubuntu Software Centre and installed to the \n/usr/bin folder.  I got the idea from an article on how to set up Ubuntu shutdown sound --> from here.\nThat one worked great also, I even added the Ubuntu start-up sound.\nThe following script also uses the commands \"trash-empty\" and \"trash-list\".\nThese commands are part of the \"trash-cli\" command line utility which was also downloaded from the Ubuntu Software Centre.\nLinux Script to Empty Trash with sound of glass breaking.\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# Name of script: empty-trash.sh\n# script to empty trash with confirmation and empty trash sound event\n# This script is located in /usr/local/bin\n\nSOUND = \"/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/trash-empty.ogg\"\ntrash-list > ~/.local/share/Trash/files/trash.lst\nfile = ~/.local/share/Trash/files/trash.lst\n\nif [ ! -s $file ]; then\n\n        rm -f $file;\n        zenity --info --text \"TRASH is EMPTY\"\n\nelse\n\n        zenity --question --title \"Confirm Yes/No\" --text \"EMPTY Trash Bin ?\"\n\n           case $? in\n\n                0)\n                trash-empty;\n                /usr/bin/music123 $SOUND\n                ;;\n\n           esac\n\nfi \n\nIf you have a trash bin on the desktop or elsewhere, it will continue to work properly and it will still show the full and empty trash bin icons. If you do not want to hear the trash-empty sound then you can right-click on your regular trash bin icon and empty the trash in the usual way.\nTo empty the trash and hear your chosen sound click on the launcher made for that purpose.  My trash-empty sound is that of breaking glass. You can choose whatever sound file you like, or make your own.\nIf you click on \"Yes\" in the zenity confirmation dialogue, then all the trash in all locations, including partitions and USB drives, will be emptied.\n                                      ~.~\n\nYou can make an \"Empty Trash\" launcher and put it on your desktop to launch this script whenever you want to empty the trash. Make sure that you have made this script executable.\n\nAttach a unique icon to the launcher.  This is the one I used:\n\nThis is the Zenity dialogue question box to confirm emptying of trash:\n\nThis is the Zenity dialogue info box that appears if the trash bin is empty \nand you have clicked on the \"Empty-Trash\" launcher.\n\nI added the above edit to provide the images that were not permitted during my initial post.

In an upstart configuration how do I define what command should be used to shutdown a server. Lets say I have daemon that has two seperate processes. \n\n\n*\n\n*startup.sh  - to start the server \n\n*shutdown.sh - to shut down the server\n\n\nSuppose I have an upstart file that looks like this. \ndescription \"Some Example Service\"\nauthor \"Me\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\nrespawn\n\nexec startup.sh \n\nHow do I tell upstart that it should call shutdown.sh when shutting down the server? How does upstart normally expect to shut down a daemon?\n\nA: Using exec to start the process is fine, but when stopping it, if you absolutely need to run a specific script or set of commands, you can use the  pre-stop stanza.\npre-stop exec shutdown.sh\n\nI assume you have tried just using an exec stanza and it didn't work, possibly because your daemon requires some specialized cleanup. Note that well-behaved daemons should receive a signal from upstart when the job is stopped, and if they handle the signal appropriately no additional cleanup should be needed.\n\nStopping a job involves sending SIGTERM to it. If there is anything\n  that needs to be done before SIGTERM, do it here. Arguably, services\n  should handle SIGTERM very gracefully, so this shouldn't be necessary.\nif there is anything critical, like a flush to disk, and raising kill\n  timeout is not an option, pre-stop is not a bad place to do it\n\nAlso read this section for the entire workflow of what happens when you stop a job. Notice when pre-stop is run, and how a signal is sent to the process afterwards, which is how upstart handles stopping jobs normally.\nMy source is the official Upstart cookbook at: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\n", "Q: Not updating display settings when disconnecting external monitor When I disconnect my monitor from my laptop, Ubuntu still seems to think that it is plugged in and does't update the display.

How would I do that?\n\nA: There is an old bug on Launchpad - bug #306735 -  which was marked invalid, the explanation being that it is a known problem but fairly complex (more explanation here).\nSo, as far as I know, there is not an automatic method for what you asked in the true sense. But you can use autorandr (you have to install disper first - run sudo apt-get install disper from terminal), a script by Stefan Tomanek. Using this script (autorandr) you can add a keyboard shortcut for autorandr --change command and all you have to do when you connect or disconnect an external monitor is to press that keyboard shortcut. All of these are explained very nice in this answer (I just tested in Ubuntu 13.04 and everything goes well).\nAfter you test the script in terminal, you must to see the following post if you want to add a custom keyboard shortcut for the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I change what keys on my keyboard do? (How can I create custom keyboard commands/shortcuts?)\n\nA: From the Appendix B in the NVIDIA driver README:\n\nOption \"UseHotplugEvents\" \"boolean\"\n\nWhen this option is enabled, the NVIDIA X driver will generate RandR display changed events when displays are plugged into or\n  unplugged from an NVIDIA GPU. Some desktop environments will listen\n  for these events and dynamically reconfigure the desktop when displays\n  are added or removed.\nDisabling this option suppresses the generation of these RandR events for non-DisplayPort displays, i.e., ones connected via VGA,\n  DVI, or HDMI. Hotplug events cannot be suppressed for displays\n  connected via DisplayPort.\nNote that probing the display configuration (e.g. with xrandr or nvidia-settings) may cause RandR display changed events to be\n  generated, regardless of whether this option is enabled or disabled.\n  Additionally, some VGA ports are incapable of hotplug detection: on\n  such ports, the addition or removal of displays can only be detected\n  by re-probing the display configuration.\nDefault: on. The driver will generate RandR events when displays are added or removed.\n\nSo, assuming you have not disabled this option, the problem narrows to one of these alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*The VGA cable or the VGA connector on the card have some DDC pins broken (either pin 12, pin 15 or pin 9). Please attach another VGA cable and try again.\n\n*Your Nvidia Quadro K1000M based video card has a connector that does NOT support this detection, and invoking xrandr or equivalents (as opening the Display Settings) fire this detection. If that is the case, this will never work --but the detection shouldn't work either on other Operative Systems. Never seen this in person, though.\n\n*Or maybe there is some bug on the NVIDIA driver that prevents this detection from working properly. Try another driver versions (such as 304) and see if the problem persists.\n\nA: If you are running some flavour of nvidia's proprietary driver, then, as mentioned in Jorge's answer, just running xrandr on its own seems to fix the issue.\n", "Q: problems with \"How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows\" I'm looking at \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nit's a really long time since I've used linux, but to me this is unclear, I've downloaded the app from Pen Drive Linux, but then when I use it, in step two it says \"Click 'Browse' and open the downloaded ISO file.\" but at no point has it told me to download an iso file, or given a link to where I download it from. \nThe one given in the picture is called precise-desktop.iso, I've no idea if that's the file I'm supposed to be downloading, or if I need to rename the file to this, or if I just need to download a regular ubuntu distribution, which is what I'm doing now.\n\nA: The screenshot is just an example.

(I'm translating from french, so the names may not be exactly the one you see.)\n\nA: If Nvidia drivers disappeared from \"additional drivers\" list, then you should try to install \"nvidia-common\" \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-common\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on late 2006 Macbook Without CD I have been trying for 14+ hours to install Ubuntu linux on my late 2006 Macbook. \nMy Macbook has functional USB drives, but the optical drive is bad. \nI have tried all kinds of \"how-to\" guides online that include sudo dd, partitioning drives, EFI, etc. But when I try to boot with EFI (refind) with the USB, or on the new drive I partitioned and sudo dd'd, it fails. \nThe screen comes up at boot with the penguin and Mac symbols, and other EFI things. But when I click on the penguin to run Ubuntu it states this:\nStarting Legacy Loader\nUSB load options 'USB'\nError: Not Found returned from legacy loader\nError: Not Found from LocateDevicePath\n\nError: Load Error while (re)opening our installation volume.\n\nThe firmware refused to boot from the selected volume. Note that external hard drives are not well-supported by Apple's firmware for legacy OS booting.\n\nHit any key to continue\n\nAnd then I have to shutdown and restart with the start button because the keyboard refuses to work.\nI am kinda at my wit's end with this. I really want Ubuntu. \nIs there any possible way to install Ubuntu on my Macbook without buying an external optical drive?\nI have seen the \"networking\" and \"bittorrent\" installation guides on the Ubuntu website, but I have no idea where to even start there. I don't really have any concept of what either of those are.\n\nA: This is a method to install Ubuntu on your MacBook using FireWire Disk mode. I had the same problem with the optical drive in my MacBook from late 2006 after pouring milk into it late one night and did get a working install this way. You will need another Mac with FireWire and a FireWire 400 cable. If the other Mac has FireWire 800, you will need a FireWire 400 to 800 cable. And you will need a disk to backup your Mac OS X install. (You also need this backup of Mac OS X to extract the firmware for your iSight webcam after the install.)\nMaybe borrow another Mac from somebody if you don't have two. The other Mac must run Mac OS X 10.4.7 or later (PowerPC or Intel doesn't matter), since otherwise it will not be able to \"see\" the disk in the MacBook. (PowerPC Macs used APT, not GUID partition tables, so only after the Intel transition did the operating system get the ability to see GUID disks.)\nWhat you basically do is install the Live DVD to one partition and install onto the rest of the disk from that partition. If you want to dual boot, you can restore your Mac OS X install to the partition we used for the Live DVD after installing Ubuntu on the other partition, but if you just want Ubuntu, then keep the other partion as a restore partition. Before partitioning, you will need to know if you want to dual boot or not to decide how large the partition you will use for the Live DVD should be. If you want to dual boot, you will have to make it as large as you want your later Mac OS X partition. If not, then it will just need to be large enough to fit the live .iso.\n(I am not using the English localisation of neither Mac OS X nor Ubuntu, so the exact worthing of buttons and such might be slightly off in these instructions, but the gist of it is right.)\nHere is how you do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your Mac OS X install to an external FireWire or USB drive. Use Carbon Copy Cloner from Bombich software (not Time Machine) if you want to dual boot. (We need an exact clone that we can restore to one of the partitions on your MacBook later, and since we can not use the Mac OS X Install disk to restore from a Time Machine backup since the optical drive doesn't work, we need an exact clone that we can restore with Disk tools from the other Mac.) NB: If you want to dual boot, make shure that your Backup does not take up more room than the size you will use for the Mac OS X partition later. (Delete all unnessecary stuff from your home folder if it is too large.)\n\n*Download and install rEFInd and restart your MacBook twice (not one time, but two times) and shut it down again.\n\n*On the other Mac, download Ubuntu 14.04 AMD64/Mac or 14.10 AMD/64 Mac. After it is downloaded, click it and press Commando+I to get the \"Get info\" window. You need the information in this window later.\n\n*Connect the FireWire cable to the other Mac and start your MacBook while holding down the T key. A FireWire symbol appears (looking like a flux capasitor) and on the other Mac, your hard drive appears in the Finder.\n\n*Open Disk tools. (In the Tools folder inside the Program folder.)\n\n*Select your MacBook's disk in the left panel and click the partition tab.\n\n*Make a new partition by hitting the + on the lower left side. Drag the dividing line between the partitions upwards or downards untill it is the size you want. \na) Single boot. If you want to just have Ubuntu on the MacBook, you will have to make it the size of the live iso file we downloaded earlier (look at the \"Get info\" window now). Add an extra gigabyte just to be shure (since sometimes a gigabyte is 1024 MB and sometimes it is 1000 MB).\nb) Dual boot. If you want to dual boot with Mac OS X, you will need to make your partition the size you want your Mac OS X partition to become later. Remember that this has to be bigger than the backup clone you made in 1 to work.\n\n*Make the new partition MS-DOS (FAT32) formatted by writing a name in the field to the right of the partition layout and selecting MS-DOS and then \"delete\" (or \"Partition\". Can't remember exactly).\n\n*Drag the .iso file from the Downloads folder into the left panel of Disk tools.\n\n*Click the \"restore\" tab and drag the Ubuntu live iso into the \"From...\" field and the new partition you made in 7 into the \"To...\" field and click \"Restore\".\n\n*Quit Disk Tools.\n\n*Eject the two partitions from the MacBook in the finder by clicking the eject buttons on the right side of their names.\n\n*Shut down your MacBook. (Hold down the power key untill the MacBook shuts down if it doesn't shut down immideatly.)\n\n*Disconnect the FireWire cable.\n\n*Restart your MacBook.\n\n*Choose \"Windows\" when the rEFInd window shows up. It thinks it is windows because the disk is formatted FAT32.\n\n*Choose install and go through the usual questions. (Tap to click is on by default, so be careful with your trackpad.) I usually choose not to update the installer, as it often seems to fail for me, but check the Fluendo restricted multimedia package, that is really nice to have. When you come to the place where you should choose where to install, choose \"Manual setup\" (or whatever it is called). DO NOT choose erase the whole disk and install (since the live iso you are running is also on the disk).\n\n*Delete the other partition of the disk (the HFS+-formatted one) and make a Swap partition the same size as your RAM (3,3 GB if you have maxed the RAM in your machine) and another EXT4 partition that you make your root partition. Press \"format\" after setting the disk up as you like. (DO NOT repartition the FAT32 partition or do anything else with it at this time.)\n\n*Install and when asked, choose to install grub on your root partition. (The EXT4-partition.)\n\n*Restart.\n\n*Dual boot only. Shut down your MacBook. Connect your Backup USB or FireWire disk to the other Mac. Reconnect your MacBook to the other Mac with the FireWire calbe and start the MacBook while holding down T. Choose \"Ignore\" when asked what to do with partitions Mac OS X can not read. Open Disk Tools (Apple menu->Recent items->Disk tools) and format the FAT32-partition to Mac OS X extended (choose the partition in the left panel (not the disk, only the partition) and use the delete tab to name it and make it Mac OS X Extended (Journaled). Go to the Restore tab. Drag your Backup disk to the \"From...\" field and the newly made Mac OS Extended (HFS+) disk into the \"To...\" field and press the \"restore\" button. Quit Disk Tools when it is finished restoring. Eject the other partitions and disks in the Finder and disconnect the FireWire cable. Restart your MacBook and at the rEFInd window you will now find Mac OS X and Linux.\n\n\nThen you need to install firmware for the isight camera and fan control.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\nI am trying to set a rotating picture of Earth as my wallpaper. I'm currently using \"Scheduled Tasks\" with this command:\nwget -O static.die.net/earth/mercator/1600.jpg \\\n     --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.224 Safari/534.10\" \\\n     http://static.die.net/earth/mercator/1600.jpg\n\nHow can I resize the image in the same command to 1280x1024?\nAlso: >/dev/null 2>&1 gets added every time the command is run. Is there a way I can fix this?\n\nA: That may be the incorrect syntax for the wget command for your desired result: simply running wget http://static.die.net/earth/mercator/1600.jpg will save the image as 1600.jpg in the current directory. Also, it looks like the --user-agent option is not necessary for that website.\nResizing the image will distort it a little bit, because you're trying to essentially \"compress\" an amount of data into a larger data container - meaning data will have to be added based on assumptions made by the image editor. You can try it anyway, though, using ImageMagick. It is provided by the imagemagick package.\nThere are one of two methods you can use to convert it. The first one, which is probably more preferable because it will not distort the image as much, is to keep the image's aspect ratio and resize it to 1280 x 887, which may still work for a 1280 x 1024 desktop background if you have, for example, a green solid background color set behind it or something. To resize the image this way, use:\nconvert 1600.jpg -resize 1280 x 887 1600_2.jpeg\n\nor\nconvert 1600.jpg -resize 1280 x 1024 1600_2.jpeg\n\nThis will shrink the image horizontally, but leave its vertical dimension the same.\nThe second method will involve shrinking the image horizontally and stretching it vertically. This will distort the image more, and the syntax for the command is:\nconvert 1600.jpeg -resize 1280 x 1024\\> 1600_2.jpeg\n\n(Source: ImageMagick website)\n", "Q: Spotify not playing local files Spotify when ran using wine will not play local files (mp3's, wma's).

I'm writing an Ubuntu Touch application in QML. I'd like to integrate with Trello. There are two ways to log into Trello in the API, one of which is OAuth, which I plan on using. What is the best way to do this from QML? I'd prefer not to use a C++ backend, but I am willing to do so if that is the only way.\n\nA: You could create an account plugin for Trello, so that a Trello account could be created from the \"Online Account\" panel in the System Settings. The you could use the Ubuntu.OnlineAccounts QML module to login, like this:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.OnlineAccounts 0.1\n\nRectangle {\n    width: 400\n    height: 300\n\n    AccountServiceModel {\n        id: accounts\n        service: \"trello-board\"\n    }\n    ListView {\n        id: listView\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        model: accounts\n        delegate: Item {\n            width: parent.width\n            height: 60\n            AccountService { \n                id: accts\n                objectHandle: accountServiceHandle\n                onAuthenticated: { console.log(\"Access token is \" + reply.AccessToken) }\n                onAuthenticationError: { console.log(\"Authentication failed, code \" + error.code) }\n            }    \n            Text {\n                anchors.fill: parent\n                text: providerName + \": \" + displayName\n                MouseArea {\n                    anchors.fill: parent\n                    onClicked: accts.authenticate(null)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code will get you the OAuth token. In order to create the account in the first place, you need to create the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/accounts/providers/trello.provider\n\n*/usr/share/accounts/services/trello-board.service\n\n*/usr/share/accounts/qml-plugins/trello/Main.qml\nGiven that Trello uses OAuth 1.0 like Flickr and twitter, just create the above files using the twitter or flickr version as a template, and modify them as needed (for the .service file, you could use flickr-sharing.service); in trello.provider you'll need to change the API endpoints as following:\n<setting name=\"RequestEndpoint\">https://trello.com/1/OAuthGetRequestToken</setting>\n<setting name=\"TokenEndpoint\">https://trello.com/1/OAuthGetAccessToken</setting>\n<setting name=\"AuthorizationEndpoint\">https://trello.com/1/OAuthAuthorizeToken</setting>\n\nAnd of course, change the other fields (callback URL, client ID and secret) to match those you set when you registered your app with Trello.\nIf all goes well, you'll be able to create a Trello account from the \"Online Accounts\" panel in the System Settings.\n\nA: Since the approach that mardy uses isn't actually available to apps under confinement on Ubuntu Touch, it is necessary to do the OAuth dance your self. Essentially, you need to load the login page in a WebView and then intercept the response using the onUrlChanged signal to extract the auth token. Below is an example using StackExchange's own OAuth implementation.\nIn OAuth.qml:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport QtWebKit 3.0\nimport \"OAuth.js\" as OAuth\n\nRectangle {\n    height: 750\n    width: 500\n\n    Text {\n        id: nextState\n        visible: false\n        anchors.centerIn: parent\n        text: \"Log in successful!\"\n    }\n\n    Item {\n        id: stackOAuth\n        property string nextState: \"AuthDone\"\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        Component.onCompleted: OAuth.checkToken()\n        property string token: \"\"\n        WebView {\n            id: loginView\n            visible: false\n            anchors.fill: parent\n            onUrlChanged: OAuth.urlChanged(url)\n        }\n        Rectangle {\n            height: 50\n            width: parent.width\n            anchors.left: parent.left\n            anchors.right: parent.right\n            anchors.bottom: parent.bottom\n            Text {\n                text: loginView.url\n            }\n        }\n\n        states: [\n            State {\n                name: \"Login\"\n                PropertyChanges {\n                    target: loginView\n                    visible: true\n                    url: \"https://stackexchange.com/oauth/dialog\"+\n                         \"?redirect_uri=https://stackexchange.com/oauth/login_success\"+\n                         \"&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=read_inbox\"\n                }\n            },\n            State {\n                name: \"AuthDone\"\n                PropertyChanges {\n                    target: loginView\n                    visible: false\n                    opacity: 0\n                }\n                PropertyChanges {\n                    target: nextState\n                    visible: true\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nThen in OAuth.js you have code to extract the token from the url and handel storing/checking it from your database:\n.import QtQuick.LocalStorage 2.0 as Sql\n\nfunction urlChanged(url) {\n    var authorized = false;\n    var mUrl = url.toString();\n    var token = \"\";\n    if (mUrl.indexOf(\"https://stackexchange.com\") > -1) {\n        var query = mUrl.substring(mUrl.indexOf('#') + 1);\n        var vars = query.split(\"&\");\n        for (var i=0;i<vars.length;i++) {\n            var pair = vars[i].split(\"=\");\n            if (pair[0] == \"access_token\") {\n                authorized = true;\n                token = pair[1];\n                console.log(\"Found token: \" + token)\n                saveToken(token);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if (authorized) {\n        stackOAuth.token = token;\n        stackOAuth.state = \"AuthDone\";\n    }\n}\n\nfunction saveToken(token) {\n    console.log(\"Saving...\")\n    var db = Sql.LocalStorage.openDatabaseSync(\"Token\", \"1.0\", \"the token\", 1);\n    var dataStr = \"INSERT INTO Token VALUES(?)\";\n    var data = [token];\n    db.transaction(function(tx) {\n        tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Token(token TEXT)');\n        tx.executeSql(dataStr, data);\n    });\n}\n\nfunction checkToken() {\n    var db = Sql.LocalStorage.openDatabaseSync(\"Token\", \"1.0\", \"the token\", 1);\n    var dataStr = \"SELECT * FROM Token\";\n    db.transaction(function(tx) {\n        tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Token(token TEXT)');\n        var rs = tx.executeSql(dataStr);\n        if (rs.rows.item(0)) {\n            stackOAuth.token = rs.rows.item(0).token\n            stackOAuth.state = \"AuthDone\"\n            console.log(\"Auth done...\")\n        } else {\n            stackOAuth.state = \"Login\"\n            console.log(\"Logging in....\")\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nThis example is (more or less) a port of the old QtQuick 1.0 example from Nokia to QtQuick 2.0.\n", "Q: couldnt install wireless driver for ubuntu 12.04 in asus laptop i could not install the wireless driver in ubuntu 12.04 in Asus x45c laptop.\ni already try all the methods in ubuntu forums. please someone help me..\n\nA: I cannot add comment, so trying to help with answer. \nFollow these instructions.

I had installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a partition. I loved it and decided to remove the Windows partition altogether. However, after doing so, I now cannot boot into Ubuntu, and get a missing bootmgr error message. I have been trying to read through similar posts, but I just can't get it. If anyone could walk me through a fix, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: I can only assume you used the old Windows boot manager to boot Ubuntu with, that Ubuntu is at least version 10.04 or later and that you actually installed Ubuntu and NOT along side of Windows like what Wubi does.\nSo if you really \"deleted\" Windows and now exclusively use Ubuntu then you don't need that old Microsoft boot manager anyway. You don't need it even if you dual boot with Ubuntu either. Problem is, that tiny little 100-Meg NTFS partition is probably still the one and only \"boot\" partition on the hard drive and still being used - or at least, it was. But the fix is pretty simple. Just change the boot flag on the hard drive from that 100-Meg partition to wherever GRUB was installed which is likely on the one and only ext4 partition (not an NTFS one).\nYou might also note that this 100-Meg NTFS Windows boot partition is typically hidden from Windows but that it can easily be exposed if you simply assign it a drive letter in Windows. That's not exactly an Ubuntu thing. I only mention it since this hidden 100-Meg Windows \"System\" partition is where the Windows boot manager lives - it's not on the actual C: drive, which, again I assume you deleted. But who cares? You don't even use Windows any more. Right?\nSo to change the boot flag to wherever GRUB lives, just boot from a live Ubuntu disk/key/(whatever - you Pixie booter you) and fire up GParted. If you like command lines you could instead use FDISK or even CFDISK but it's nowhere near as pretty. Note that GParted is on the live Ubuntu disk (as well as countless other distros) but is never actually installed when you install Ubuntu. So using GParted, find the partition that has GRUB on it which is typically on the one and only ext4 partition and in a folder called /boot. Use GParted to assign that ext4 partition the boot \"flag\" and you're done. (Alternatively, as with any partition editor, you can do much destructive things like adjust partitions, create partitions, or even delete them. So be careful!)\nIn GParted specifically, highlight whatever partition that contains Ubuntu's /boot folder (which is where GRUB lives and is likely identified as /dev/hda1 with an ext4 file type), then select \"Partition\" from GParted's menu, go to \"Manage Flags\" and be sure the \"boot\" box is checked. Exit GParted (or whatever) and reboot from the hard drive that you just fixed.\nIf you were using the old Windows boot manager (XP to present day) then the boot flag on that old 100-Meg NTFS partition will be set. Again, this 100-Meg partition is unnecessary for GRUB and Ubuntu. That is, unless you did something during the Ubuntu installation that we still don't know about. And assuming there aren't any other problems with GRUB or anything else, which could very well exist, you should now be using GRUB to boot with instead of the old Windows boot manager. (You might also note that the GRUB menu doesn't even show up during the boot process unless it has detected another OS like Windows - or even another Linux OS.)\nDon't worry about the boot flag thing either. You can always change it back or even to any other partition on that one physical hard drive without fear of any real damage. However you do need to check your BIOS setting to know what physical hard drive is actually booting! Because if you have more than one physical hard drive attached then THIS may be all you need to check!\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: How to use Arguments in QML without getting qmlscene arguments I'm trying to write a QML application to be launched by qmlscene.  I want this to accept arguments, so I'm using the Arguments object.  However, this gets the arguments passed to qmlscene as well as those I mean to pass to my program.  More problematically, if one of the arguments is a file, qmlscene tries to process it, failing or hanging.  Is there a good way around this problem?\nThe first thing I tried was to pass the arguments in as a specific named argument that qmlscene would ignore.  The launch line looks like qmlscene -I <directory> <qml file> --appargs=\"$*\".  ($* is a bashism for all the arguments as a single string.)  For a single argument, this works pretty well.  But if I were to want to pass more than one argument in, I'd have to parse them myself, which sort of defeats the purpose of having an argument parser.\nLooking at some sample .desktop files, I noticed they put the arguments before the qml file, so I tried a command line like qmlscene \"$@\" -I <directory> <qml file>.  This does keep qmlscene from trying to interpret these arguments.  But if I don't pass any arguments, the Arguments object will happily process the arguments meant for qmlscene.  So I still have to do some processing here.  I can't help but suspect I missing a better way.  What is it?\n\nA: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtqml/qtqml-releasenotes.html suggests that there is a Qt.application.arguments property in Qt 5.1. I do not know whether this does what's required, though.\n", "Q: How install GraphicsMagick with quantum 16 How can I configure GraphicsMagick to use --with-quantum-depth=16 before installing it with apt-get? Is it possible to do or should I build it from source?\n\nA: I tried the approach suggested in the answer but it does not work.  After some analysis I realized that it makes the package and installs it, but it does not change the library itself.\ni.e. /usr/lib/libGraphicsMagick++.so.3.6.2 has the original package build date, and octave goes on saying:\nwarning: your version of GraphicsMagick limits images to 8 bits per pixel\n\nTherefore I issued the command make install from the directory\ngraphicsmagick-1.3.18/ and this changes the library. As a consequence octave does not work properly anymore: running imgread some symbol can not be found.\nIn order to put it back to work you have to run apt-get build-dep octave, obtain octave sources, run ./configure, compile, and install. Then you get:\nwarning: your version of GraphicsMagick limits images to 16 bits per pixel\n\nThis is not an orthodox approach for sure, but if you really need 16 bits per pixel, it works.\n\nA: You should build it from source (you should make sure that your deb-src lines in your sources.list are activated, and you ran sudo apt-get update):\nmkdir src && cd src && apt-get source graphicsmagick\n\nEnter the graphicsmagick-* directory. Now, run vim debian/rules (if you want to use another text editor, be my guest) and look for the line that reads:\n\n./configure $(gm_confflags) \\\n\nbellow this add (you need to press I to insert) --with-quantum-depth=16 \\ so it should more or less looks like:\n    CFLAGS=\"$(CFLAGS)\" CXXFLAGS=\"$(CFLAGS)\" LDFLAGS=\"$(LDFLAGS)\" \\\n        ./configure $(gm_confflags) \\\n            --with-quantum-depth=16 \\\n            --enable-shared \\\n            --enable-static \\\n            --enable-libtool-verbose \\\n            --prefix=/usr \\\n            --mandir=\\$${prefix}/share/man \\\n            --infodir=\\$${prefix}/share/info \\\n            --docdir=\\$${prefix}/share/doc/graphicsmagick \\\n            --with-gs-font-dir=/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts \\\n            --with-x \\\n            --x-includes=/usr/include/X11 \\\n            --x-libraries=/usr/lib/X11 \\\n            --without-dps \\\n            --without-modules \\\n            --without-frozenpaths \\\n            --with-perl \\\n            --with-perl-options=\"INSTALLDIRS=vendor\"\n\nSave the file (press Esc, then type :wq and hit Enter), and run:\nsudo apt-get build-dep graphicsmagick\ndpkg-buildpackage\nsudo dpkg -i ../graphicsmagick*.deb\n\nThe first one installs the build dependencies, the second builds the package, the third installs the packages.

If the running Apache2 instance path is other than the one installed with lampp (the one located at /opt/lampp) then there is a strong possibility that there may be conflict in other services too like MySQL, etc.\nAlso a good place to check is /var/log/* (check for apache2/* logs, mysql.log and mail.* logs)\nThe procedure above may be used to find other potential conflicitng services like MySQL, Postfix, etc.\nPossible Solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall one stack, that is either the LAMPP or the rest probable installed by the package manager (apt)\n\n*Check the all startup scripts and stop the conflicting services\n\n*Check the PHP source and see which service calls or tune it by giving a full path to the executable.\n", "Q: Can't login after power outage I have a desktop with no battery power with a very simple surge protector.

I have an Ubuntu 12.04 production server with a 500 GB (nearly 15 gb used) HDD. I want to duplicate whole HDD including, its partition structure, to another HDD with 400 GB size so that changing the HDD will not affect the working system. \nWhich tool is the best solution for this task?\n\nA: There are many tools that can do this, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Clonezilla is a utility that's often used for this task; however, I'm not sure how well it would cope with the fact that your target disk is smaller than the source disk.\nAnother option is to manually partition the target (using GParted, parted, fdisk, gdisk, or some other tool), create filesystems on the target, mount the target partitions, and copy everything over with cp or tar. This will require some additional changes on the target, such as (possibly) adjusting its /etc/fstab and installing a boot loader. Overall, this method requires more effort than many, but if you know what you're doing, it's quite flexible, and it can definitely copy from a larger disk to a smaller one, provided the files will actually fit into the target space.\n\nA: *\n\n*Backup your production-hdd. \n\n*Use gparted to shrink your production-harddisk to a little less than the capacity of your target-disk, in your case smaller than 400GB.\n\n*Copy whole hdd. To do so, boot from a live-cd and use dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdc bs=1M where sda is your production-hdd and sdc your new hdd. Or something like clonezilla (copy whole disk).\n\n\nA: I would recommend Clonezilla, its simple to use, performs whole disks backup, and doesnt use much space for the backup also.\nTo do that, first you would have to download the clonezilla ISO from here.\nAfter you have downloaded it, you will need to burn it to a CD.\nThen you will have to boot from it to do the full system Backup.\nThe full procedure for it is given here- http://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live-doc.php\nYou will have to choose the option \"Save disk image\", the procedure for which is given here-http://clonezilla.org/show-live-doc-content.php?topic=clonezilla-live/doc/01_Save_disk_image\nAfter you have made the backup, you can restore it using the option- \"Restore Disk Image\", the procedure for which is given here- http://clonezilla.org/show-live-doc-content.php?topic=clonezilla-live/doc/02_Restore_disk_image\nLook into it. If you have any queries let us know.\nThank You!\n\nA: As others proposed, Clonezilla could do the job if you resize working partition to smaller size.\nHowever, I have seen there is a tool named FSArchiver\nthat allows to restore data to a smaller drive, as soon as the data fits in (like in your case). I am sorry I can not help you more in this since I have used only Clonezilla but there is some information in the link and in their forum.\n\nA: You can use dd to copy the disk.

If so, what then goes in the /etc/resolv.conf file?\nTo be honest, I'd rather have it all in the one file so it makes the end users life easier to just modify one file.\nIf it can be done in one file, what would be an example for DHCP (with regards to DHCP settings)\nThank you in advance for any help and suggestions!\n\nA: You should not edit /etc/resolv.conf in Ubuntu.\nUbuntu is using the resolvconf program that generates /etc/resolv.conf when DNS information is changed by DHCP clients, NetworkManager or ifup.\nBest bet is to add \ndns-nameservers 192.168.3.45 192.168.8.10\n\nto the appropriate stanza in your /etc/network/interfaces.  After making this change you normally have to ifdown and ifup the interface for the information to be pushed to resolvconf and thus to /etc/resolv.conf, but it is possible to push the info without a downup, as described in the following answer which also provides some background information that may help you.\nHow do I get resolvconf to regenerate resolv.conf after I change /etc/network/interfaces?\n", "Q: External HDD error - data recovery Ubuntu 12.04 I recently connected my external HDD to Ubuntu 12.04, but now it's not working.

So every user who wants to install my application can install it by typing \"apt-get install myappname\".\nHow can I build it?\n\nA: You can do this by uploading your program to launchpad and creating PPA.\nPPA:\n\nA PPA is a Personal Package Archive, and is a method of distributing\n  software to users, without requiring developers to undergo the full\n  process of distribution in the main ubuntu repositories. \nPPAs can be used to extend the available software in ubuntu to both\n  programs that are not otherwise available in ubuntu, as well as to\n  allow newer versions, such as beta programs, that have not yet\n  undergone sufficient testing to be imported into the main archive.\n\nQuoted from Ubuntu website\nThere is a\nLaunchpad PPA help file\nTo install your program, users will need to add the ppa to their repositories like so:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:yourppaname\n\nand then after syncing the package index with apt-get update they will be able to install it with apt-get install\n", "Q: Dependency issues while trying to upgrade 12.04.2 to the 12.04.3 HWE stack While trying to upgrade my system to the latest hardware enablement stack from Ubuntu 12.04.2/Linux 3.5 I get the following error:\n$ sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-raring xserver-xorg-lts-raring libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-raring\nReading package lists...

This upgrade was far from smooth for me. Aside from all the dependency issues described in this Q&A, I had to manually install Raring packages to get my WLAN (broadcom) to work. Similar issues might arise if you have hardware that's running using proprietary drivers (installed via the \"Additional Drivers\" dialog).\nSo be wary when installing these hardware enablement stacks. It's a a feature that obviously still needs a lot of work.\n\nA: If there are some umet dependencies, you could try to add these dependent packages to your install command. For example, your install command could be like this: \nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-raring xserver-xorg-lts-raring libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-raring libglapi-mesa-lts-raring libgl1-mesa-dri-lts-raring xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-raring ...\nI just upgraded to 12.04.3 and I had the same problem. In my case, there are a lot of removed stuffs after I issue the install command and sadly the upgrade breaks my ubuntu :-(. It took me ~1/2 day to make my system works with the new xorg stack. So be carefull if there are many removed packages :-).\n\nA: I had the same problem, but just purged the quantal Hardware Enablement Stack (HWE):\nsudo apt-get purge linux-generic-lts-quantal xserver-xorg-lts-quantal\n\nI did not reboot the machine and installed the raring HWE:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-raring xserver-xorg-lts-raring\n\nSome time into the installation there was a warning about an application crash. The installation continued and all raring parts seemed to get installed. After rebooting I checked the version of the kernel. Ubuntu vas the running the 3.5-kernel. I repeated:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-raring xserver-xorg-lts-raring\n\nand the 3.8-kernel got set up. Everything else were set up the first time. It seems the application crash caused the kernel to not be configured the first time.\n", "Q: Pasting paths into gnome-terminal How can I paste the path to a file or folder into the terminal. When I try to do this, it pastes the path as file:///home/user/path/file. How can I make it paste as a normal path.

Is it possible to use the ball of a trackball mouse as a 360° scroller (or a 2D mouse wheel)?\n\nA: I found a very nice solution for my question and thought others might be interested. It works on any mouse not just trackballs.\nopen or create the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf and add the following section:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n   Identifier  \"Mouse0\"\n   Driver \"evdev\"\n   MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n   MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n\n   Option \"EmulateWheel\" \"true\"\n   Option \"EmulateWheelButton\" \"9\"\n\n   Option \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\n   Option \"XAxisMapping\" \"6 7\"\nEndSection\n\nLogout and relogin or restart. Now by pressing button #9 you can use the trackball (or mouse) as a 360° scroller. Very handy for photo editing for example.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 no menu bars I just played with Ubuntu 13.04 on my old netbook.

This is often done by default for some commands like ls or grep, like alias ls='ls --color=auto'. Some background in here. \nTo run the original command and not the alias, you might use command passwd stuff-to-do.\nThat being said, substituting security-related binaries is a dumb idea.\nEDIT:\n.bashrc is not read in non-interactive shell by default, that is when running a script, a shell used by the script does not read the .bashrc file. You might use a function for that in .bashrc and then export it, like:\npasswd(){\n    /home/Unknown/bin/passwd\n}\nexport -f passwd\n\nI did not test that with passwd, but it should work.\nSome of the details come from this question's answers.\n\nA: As said in previous answers, best practice is to not name your script with the same name of an already existing system file/command. \nIf you really have to call it like that, then perhaps at least add the .sh to diversify a bit, e.g. call you script 'passwd.sh' (in general, also a best practice for shell scripts) so you minimize chances of confusion.\nAs for your question, I would suggest to create a bin directory under your home directory or perhaps (if you have rights) place it in /usr/local/bin and then amend the user PATH variable so that the scripts in the chosen location are found/accessible, for example:\n$ cd; mkdir bin\n$ export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nNote that the PATH variable may already contain those locations, best check beforehand via:\n$ echo $PATH\n\n", "Q: Adjusting the background color/picture for each workspace I remember some years ago when playing with linux you could adjust the background color or picture independantly for each workspace, so you could have different colors on each space.   \nIs that possible in Ubuntu 12.04 lts ?\n\nA: There is a tool called wallpapoz that will allow you to do many things with wallpapers including per workspace wallpaper.\nsudo apt-get install wallpapoz\n\nsource\nfor colors I have no idea.\n", "Q: Replacing Windows 8 with Ubuntu Just bought a Samsung Series 9 laptop (I7, 128GB SSD) with Windows 8 preinstalled.

Chances are the laptop has UEFI or Secure Boot which complicates things.\nAlso the laptop probably has a recovery partition. Keep it! Normally you should be able to reinstall Windows 8 using the recovery disk if you decide you need it. I'm pretty sure the Windows 8 partition can be removed, but not the recovery partition!\nThere is more information about UEFI/Secure Boot at the Ubuntu Documentation UEFI wiki.\n", "Q: How can a user create a file without write permissions? I have a webserver with Apache ITK, configured for a specific vhost to use a specific username within it's folder. Now, this user is an owner of the files, but has no write permissions in the folder in question, however yesterday, the site has been compromised and two files with write permission have just appeared in the folder.\nMy question is: How?\nI understand that if a website is compromised, a lot can happen, but the website is still running from within the context of that username, which simply did not have permission to write any files to that folder. Or am I understanding permissions incorrectly?\n\nA: You're forgetting the key flaw with ITK... The main process (that handles all the child processes) is running as root.\nIf you can attack Apache early on in the process, (rather than than an exploited php script), the hacker has root. Kansas is going bye-bye.\nI'm not a security expert but ITK seems like a giant liability in exchange for slightly more simple configuration.\n", "Q: ATI Graphics Card detected as different card Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I ran the codesudo lshw -c display to get the model of my graphics card that I am using.

That it not something I will want to permit to everyday users.\nAnyway, /etc/mtab shows the device mounted like this,\n/dev/sde /media/usb0 vfat rw,noexec,nodev,sync,noatime,nodiratime 0 0\n/dev/sdd /media/usb1 vfat rw,noexec,nodev,sync,noatime,nodiratime 0 0\n\nThere is no entry for this in /etc/fstab so the scenario is happening from a default setting after recent upgrade.\nFurther details on the device (df -hT),\n/dev/sde       vfat      922M  385M  537M  42% /media/usb0\n/dev/sdd       vfat      7.3G  7.1G  229M  97% /media/usb1\n\nThe other usb devices like external hard drives get mounted with the ownership of current user, no problem.\nAfter mounting of the Transcend device, the operations\nsudo chown -vR <user>:<user> /media/usb0\nsudo chown -vR <user>:<user> /media/usb1\n\nfailed, as they should.\nI have already taken a look at these answers, 1, 2, 3, without any avail.\nAs intructed in the last one, I even tried running the command, \nsudo usermod -a -G plugdev,fuse masroor\n\nBut that did not improve the scenario.\n\nA: After a long search and agony, I found from here that usbmount was the offending package causing all this unnecessary trouble. \nOnce I uninstalled usbmount,\nsudo apt-get purge usbmount\n\nthings are good again.\nIt appears that usbmount is not even needed in a desktop version. It is needed in a server though.

Any ideas as to how to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the keyboard settings, or\n\n*stop the keyboard settings from reverting my keys?\n\n\nA: Does it happen when your PC goes to sleep?  If so, make sure the keyboard is plugged into the PC and not the monitor.

In my case, xmodmap is \"reverted\" when I attach my laptop to a new screen and keyboard after a suspend.\nI have not found a solution that works 100%, but I put the xmomap command both in the Startup Programs and in .bashrc so that when xmodmap is reverted I can quickly fix it by opening a terminal.\n", "Q: How to install libav from launchpad?

I manipulated with filesystem using info from df -h and now the info from fstab confuses me\n\nA: Mounting and unmounting is a runtime thing. They don't write anything to disk - they just alter the in-kernel way the filesystem is mapped. Mouts are loaded from /etc/fstab so unless you've changed that, just restarting the computer would get things back in order. sudo mount -a might even work. It might not.\nWhat would happen on a normal system if you forcefully unmounted /mnt is you would unmount the root filesystem (they would be the same device). The computer would grind to a halt near-instantaneously. On a normal computer, restarting would follow /etc/fstab and remount / (and everything in it, including /mnt) and put everything back in the right place.\nIn short: Reboot (or boot to a LiveCD for added safety) then see what the damage actually is.\n", "Q: getting directory of a specific file in a folder and save it into a variable Here is my problem.

What does \n%:\n    dh $@\n\nmean? Why does dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot say dh: No packages to build.?\n\nA: The rules file is what does all the work for actually creating the package. It is a Makefile with targets to compile and install the application, then create the .deb file from the installed files. It also has a target to clean up all the build files so you end up with just a source package again. As the Debian Policy Manual puts it:\n\nThis file must be an executable makefile, and contains the\n  package-specific recipes for compiling the package and building binary\n  package(s) from the source.\n\nThat's nice and all, but what is actually going on here:\n%:\n    dh $@\n\ndh is a helper command that calls other Make targets and runs a series of debhelper commands. As its manpage  describes it:\n   dh runs a sequence of debhelper commands. The supported sequences\n   correspond to the targets of a debian/rules file: build-arch, build-\n   indep, build, clean, install-indep, install-arch, install, binary-arch,\n   binary-indep, and binary.\n\nAgain, it's just a helper file to simplify things. You don't actually need to use it, but it makes your life much easier. To see what commands are actually run in each target, run:\ndh binary-arch --no-act\n\nNow to your specific problem... I don't think it has anything to do with your rules file. Without seeing the actual source package, it is hard to say with certainty what the issue is. Though I'd hazard to guess that there is no binary package stanza in your debian/control file. In the following snippet, the first 'stanza' describes the source package while the second describes the binary package it will build:\nSource: hello\nSection: devel\nPriority: optional\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>\nXSBC-Original-Maintainer: Jane Doe <packager@example.com>\nStandards-Version: 3.9.1\nBuild-Depends: debhelper (>= 7)\nHomepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/\n\nPackage: hello\nArchitecture: any\nDepends: ${shlibs:Depends}\nDescription: The classic greeting, and a good example\n The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting. It\n allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which\n would otherwise be unavailable to them. Seriously, though: this is\n an example of how to do a Debian package. It is the Debian version of\n the GNU Project's `hello world' program (which is itself an example\n for the GNU Project).\n\n\nA: The very important mistake I made in the Makefile is not using $(DESTDIR). I am posting  it to help those who struggle to build debian package with this common mistake. So the correct Makefile should be: \nAPPNAME=remotedevicecontroller\ninstall:\n    install config.xml ${DESTDIR}/etc/${APPNAME}.conf.xml\n    install devices.rules ${DESTDIR}/etc/udev/rules.d/${APPNAME}.rules\n    install error.log ${DESTDIR}/var/log/${APPNAME}.log\n    install init.conf ${DESTDIR}/etc/init/${APPNAME}.conf\n    install init.d ${DESTDIR}/etc/init.d/${APPNAME}\n    install ${CND_ARTIFACT_NAME_${CONF}} ${DESTDIR}/usr/local/bin/${APPNAME}\n    chmod u+x ${CND_ARTIFACT_NAME_${CONF}}\n    ./${CND_ARTIFACT_NAME_${CONF}} -i\n\nIf some make targets fail overriding the corresponding dh_make target in rules file might help in successful packaging. \noverride_dh_auto_test:\n%:\n    dh clean\n    dh binary\n\nthe test target in my application is giving error and it is not important, so I've overridden dh_auto_test.\nAnd remember to cleanup all the trace files left by your failed trials before a new try.\n", "Q: How do I install uTorrent on 12.04? I have just install Ubuntu 12.04 and I want to install uTorrent. It's was easy on Windows.

(Wine based methods)\n\n\n*\n\n*PlayOnLinux (POL)\n\n*Winetricks\n\n\nYou can install uTorrent by following the blow procedure. But, i recommend to use buil-in torrent client like Vuze in 12.04. \nMETHOD 1: (PlayOnLinux)\nIf you have executable of uTorrent, ie; uTorrent.exe, it is better to try POL. \nPOL installation:-\nRun the command in a terminal:\nwget -q \"http://deb.playonlinux.com/public.gpg\" -O- | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo wget http://deb.playonlinux.com/playonlinux_precise.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nClick on the install button, after running the POL. Then click on the link below the POL install menu window: \n\nInstall a non-listed program\n\nThen follow the procedure as you install uTorrent on Windows.\nMETHOD 2: (Winetricks)\nThis can be used if you don't have any uTorrent.exe files.\nFirst install Winetricks using:\nsudo apt-get install winetricks. \nThen try : winetricks utorrent. \n(Or manually go to Winetricks GUI and select \"Install an app-->uTorrent-->OK)\nIt will show otput as:\nExecuting w_do_call utorrent\nExecuting load_utorrent\n------------------------------------------------------\nPlease download utorrent_2.2.1.exe from http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=38, place it in /home/myname/.cache/winetricks/utorrent, then re-run this script.\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, go to the link  uTorrent download  and download uTorrent.exe and place it in the specified folder \"/home/myname/.cache/winetricks/utorrent\".\nThat's it. In any of the above you can enjoy uTorrent in 12.04.\n\nA: As an alternative I recommend qBitTorrent. It can be found in the Ubuntu Software Center.

They appear to have visual basic support, but are better know for C#. I recommend looking into mono software. \nJust because you develop applications on Linux doesn't mean your code has to be open-source, just as if you develop on Windows you can make your code open source. For more information on making (or getting involved in) open source projects, take a look at https://github.com/\n\nA: You can still develop .net application in linux using Mono framework which is a similar opensource implementation of MS .net Framework with additions, however you won't be using your usual IDE (visual studio) but there is a very decent replacement IDE named Mono Develop it supports many languages including VB.net. This is for 1st part, concerning SQL 2005 please refer to this question maybe you'll need to install sqlserver in another machine and access it from Ubuntu.\nTo install Mono framework use\nsudo apt-get install mono-runtime\n\nTo install monodevelop\nsudo apt-get install monodevelop\n\nMore information here\n", "Q: What is the difference between IPython and IPython3? They are both on the repos. But I can't find out what the difference is.\n\nA: They are the same application, but for different python versions. IPython uses Python 2.7 while IPython3 uses Python 3. If you don't know which one you need probably the right is the 2.7 one, as Python 2.7 comes preinstalled in Ubuntu, while Python 3 has to be installed by you.\nThere are a lot of packages that follow this naming convention. So if you find a package named python-XYZ, probably it is for Python 2.7, and depending on the specific package, there may be also available a python3-XYZ package.\n\nA: ipython uses the python2 libraries and interpreter, while ipython3 uses the python3 libraries and interpreter.  \nIn general it's better to use the non-numbered package, since later it will be upgraded to use python3 automatically when ubuntu switches which version is the default python interpreter.  If you specifically need something from Python 3 now, then install the ipython3 package.\nYou can check the dependencies and contents of the packages online:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/ipython\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/ipython3\n", "Q: Nexus 4 not detected as USB device with OTA update 4.3 I have submitted a question on the Google Mobile forum, but not had any responses yet.\nI am fairly certain that my issues with USB connectivity started when I allowed the 4.3 OTA update to install on my personal handset.

So I want to write custom plugins, then I create a project with qml extension library. However, when I run it, it just pops up a dialog.\nI have no reputation to upload an image, if you can do it self, you will know what I say.\nI want to know whether I can use c++ in ubuntu touch apps, if I can, I want some examples.\nPs: I am new to qml and ubuntu sdk\n\nA: I just learned how to do this, and I wrote up what I learned here.  I'll repeat the basic ideas here.\nWhichever C++ classes you wish to expose can be left mostly as is.  Any methods that you want exposed to QML need to be prefixed with Q_INVOKABLE in the header file.  To represent the plugin, you need a class that inherits from QQmlExtensionPlugin which has a registerTypes method that calls qmlRegisterType on each class to be exposed to QML.\nThe dialog you mention, was it this?\n\nIf so, then for \"Command\" put qmlscene and for \"Arguments\", -I <DIR> <QML>, where <DIR> is the directory containing the plugin directory (likely ., the project directory) and <QML> is your main .qml file.

I put in a boot repair CD... and that is not recognized either.\nI am very new to Linux... so I'm lost.\nI wanted to re-install Ubuntu 13.04, because my boot is full, and only has 2.64 MB of storage left.  I cannot add or remove software, as they fail due to this error.  My intention was to re-install 13.04, use gpart to increase my boot drive space, to avoid this problem again.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Your DVD not booting is most likely due to the DVD-ROM not being the primary boot device in your BIOS. If you go into the BIOS menu (using F1 or F2 or DEL when you boot up. The exact key depends on your manufacturer) \nSecondly the lack of space in your boot drive can be fixed by removing older kernels installed on your system and you dont necessarily need to do a full re-install. Check what kernels you have using:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image\n\nThen remove the older versions safely using:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-<older-version-numbers seen in the output of dpkg -l\n\nWARNING\nDo not remove the latest version or your system won't boot obviously since you have any kernel installed.\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you're unable to boot the installation DVD because your firmware is launching Ubuntu directly. (This is a little unclear because you've got too many instances of \"it\" in your first paragraph, making it hard to disentangle their intended referents.) If so, the solution is in your firmware. Chances are hitting a function key as the computer powers up will bring up a boot manager menu that will enable you to boot the DVD. Unfortunately, the details of what key to press vary from one computer to another. The time window for pressing the key is also likely to be quite narrow. Repeatedly pressing the key from the time you hit the power switch is the best way to get in on most computers.\nThat said, instead of re-installing, I recommend launching to the Ubuntu live CD/DVD and launching GParted. This will enable you to re-size your partitions, which should enable you to continue using your current setup. (You may need to deactivate swap space before you can move or resize that, and sometimes other, partitions.) That said, there's always a risk of data loss when re-sizing partitions, so be sure to back up any critical data before you begin.\n", "Q: Download and install without a cd on a microsoft windows xp desktop machine I have been trying to download and install latest Ubuntu without making a cd.\nI have tried 3 times.

Do I need to make a swap partition?\n\n\nI don't have any other OS' installed.\n\nA: I'm not completely clear on what you're trying to do, but let me try to tackle some of your questions.\nWhen installing Ubuntu with separate partitions there are generally four partitions you want to create.\nYour root, boot, swap and home partitions.\nYour root partition is where everything important is stored, including program files.\nTo install your partitions over four drives\nWhen installing Ubuntu select the option that allows you to define your partitions manually.\nThe basic idea will be to create identical partition layouts on each drive. The boot partition should be the first and have the boot flag on. Followed by swap (you want a swap partition, but it doesn't have to be big 1GB should do it), and then root(the rest of your space). You don't have to create a home partition since you want it on your HDD. Do the same (exact) thing for each disk.\nThen you want to configure the software raid. \nDo some research on what type of raid you want.\nTo configure the software raid you want to define the like partitions across each drive, as that partition to use in the RAID array.\nex. sdx1 is the swap partition on each drive. so select sda1,sdb1, sdc1 and sdd1 to use as the swap partition.\nIf any of this made sense and your were able to get your OS installed across four drives, all thats left to do is mount your hdd at /home. sudo mount /dev/sdxx /home\n", "Q: Directory issues with joomla install, realized I was running as root Sorry if this is long: I'm running version 12.04, Apache web server and php 5\nI am attempting to install joomla in var/www/, everything seemed to have went ok but as I was viewing my directory permissions via the joomla control panel I noticed that nothing was available for writing.

If any user should be able to unmount, then use users instead of user in the fstab line.\n\nNote: the user option also implies noexec, nosuid, and nodev, so if you need those options, you'll need to add their counterparts. For example, if you're going to need to execute binary files from the drive, you should add the option exec, so your options would be uid=1000,noauto,user,exec, and the same goes for the other two.\nFurther reading: Fstab - Ubuntu Documentation\n\nA: If you have an entry for a device in /etc/fstab, it will prevent the Ubuntu automatic mounter from mounting that device when plugged in.\nI just tested this on my system which was automatically mounting my thumb-drive upon insertion:\n// insert thumb-drive\n$ grep gvfsd /proc/mount\ngvfsd-fuse on /run/user/msw/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=msw)\n\nWhen I added the line\n/dev/sdb1   /mnt    vfat    noexec 0 0\n\nto /etc/fstab and inserted the thumb-drive, there was a flurry of activity by the process gvfsd-udisks2-volume-monitor which included opening and reading /etc/fstab (as shown by strace). The thumb-drive did not mount.\nWhen I changed /etc/fstab by adding one character to comment out the entry:\n#/dev/sdb1   /mnt    vfat    noexec 0 0\n\ngvfsd-udisks2-volume-monitor became busy again and mounted the thumb drive. I didn't have to take out the thumb-drive and reinsert it, I didn't have to send a signal to gvfsd, so the automatic mounting daemon seems to be watching /etc/fstab for changes.\nI don't know why it behaves this way, but the test was simple and repeatable.\n", "Q: What mechanism prevents shutdown when another open session exists? The system refuses to shut down or reboot while another (GUI) session is open. It simply logs me out, when I select shut down or restart from the system menu.\nHow is that accomplished?\nI am not asking for a rationale (it is quite clear that shutting down might have adverse impacts on the work of another user) but for the mechanism behind this behavior.\n\nA: When you click the shutdown button (in Unity):\n\n\n*\n\n*The SessionView asks the SessionManager if the user is authorized to shutdown. \n\n*The SessionManager uses systemd-logind to check /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Manager for the authorization.\n\n*ConsoleKit sets that property essentially by checking if multiple users are logged in. If multiple users are logged in, it denies authorization. In addition, depending on how the system has been set up, ConsoleKit may also use polkit or role-based access control to determine authorization.\n\n*If SessionView does not receive authorization for the user to shutdown, it changes the action mode from shutdown to logout. \nAs an aside, note that this behavior (and how to implement it) is a decision made by Ubuntu. I had recently installed Arch with Gnome 3.8 to a partition, so logged in two users there to see how what happened when one of them shutdown. There was a message warning that other users were logged in and might lose work, but clicking OK let the shutdown continue.\n[Edit based on OP comment]\nThe simplest way to change this behavior is to bypass it. In a terminal or a script, issue:\nsudo shutdown -h 0 for immediate shutdown or sudo shutdown -r 0 for a restart.\nThis assumes the user who wants to shutdown has administrative privileges, but the user could also be granted admin privilege only for shutdown.\nWith a script you cold add in some of niceties like warning about other logged in users and allowing the user to change their mind about shutting down.\nSomeone else may have another idea (or could likely provide a fleshed-out script in response to a new question), but I can't think of anything easy (say, without recompiling a custom version of Unity) or safe beyond this solution. \n", "Q: Copy/paste not working in VirtualBox with XP as guest OS on Ubuntu 13.04 I'm unable to copy/paste or drag/drop in Sun VirtualBox with Windows XP as Guest OS on Ubuntu 13.04.\nI've already checked the settings to Bidirectional.

The problem seems to be that the modules required to mount my disk were contained in the missing linux-image-extra-3.13.0-49-generic which stopped the boot. To make matters worse, keyboard drivers also seem to be part of the extras image, which meant that there was no way for me to skip the error.\nIn the end, I decided to remove the incomplete kernel image by booting into an older kernel version and running apt-get purge linux-image-3.13.0-49-generic and update-grub2.\n", "Q: How can I assign Spanish characters on a French Canadian netbook keyboard I would like to assign \n\n\n*\n\n*Alt Gr + n to type ñ\n\n*Alt Gr + i to type ¡\n\n*Alt Gr + g to type ¿\n\n\nHow can I program those key combinations?\nUbuntu 12.04, Mini Dell 9 netbook, French Canadian keyboard\nUpdate: I found out about the compose key under Settings, Keyboard Layout, Options.

I must create a new ubuntu 12.04.2 boot disk after the /boot directory on my old HDD got corrupted.  The following is the partition scheme I'm planning.  Is there anything wrong with this for this system, or anything not wrong but stupid (too small/large/other)?  Is there any chance the 64MB EFI partition might someday be too small (do more files ever get stored in that partition)?\n1:  single OS  - only OS is just downloaded 64-bit ubuntu 12.04.2 install DVD.\n2:  3TB drive  - boot drive is 3TB SATA drive (6Gbps).\n3:  PC purpose - software development (codeblocks) and email (thunderbird).\n4:  system     - 8-core AMD, 4 SATA hard disk drives, 2 SATA blu-ray drives.\n\n64MB          efi partition\n32GB          swap partition\n64GB   ext2   /boot partition\n64GB   ext4   / (root) partition\nrest   ext4   /home partition\n\nIs this reasonable partitioning for 3TB drive for this purpose?  Are all these partitions \"primary partitions\" (seems like one too many partitions for that, but not sure how this EFI stuff works).\n\nA: The GUID Partition Table (GPT), which is used on most EFI installations, doesn't distinguish between primary, extended, and logical partitions; it just has \"partitions\" (with no qualifier), although tools like GParted insist on calling them \"primary partitions\" because those tools were written with MBR in mind. GPT supports up to 128 partitions by default, although that value can be changed with the right software. (In Linux, gdisk can do this, but GParted and parted can't.)\nAs to your layout, your sizes are all wrong. I recommend the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI System Partition (ESP; /boot/efi): 550MiB. Although a standard Ubuntu installation isn't likely to consume more than the 64MB you propose, there are scenarios in which it must be significantly larger. Furthermore, some EFIs have problems with FAT16 ESPs or with sub-512MiB FAT32 ESPs. To avoid both problems, the partition must be over 512MiB. I recommend a bit bigger to avoid confusion between MB (10^6 bytes) and MiB (2^20 bytes), hence 550MiB.\n\n*(Optional) /boot partition: 500MiB. This directory holds your kernel, initrd, and a handful of other files. One of my current Ubuntu installations has 111MiB in there right now, and another has 90MiB. Thus, your proposed 64GB is way oversized. 500MiB gives you plenty of \"wiggle room\" for installing multiple kernels. Note that this partition is optional. In most cases you don't really need it, although it can be handy sometimes.\n\n*Root (/) partition: 30GiB. A typical Ubuntu installation is likely to consume 4-10GiB. Unless you anticipate storing lots of extra system software, 30GiB should be more than big enough. OTOH, going up to the 64GB you propose isn't completely ridiculous on a 3TB hard disk.\n\n*Swap partition: 1-2 times RAM size. If you've got 16GiB of RAM, your proposed swap partition size is not out of line; but with less RAM, you should probably reduce the swap space. Modern systems seldom use swap space at all, so many people stick closer to the 1x RAM size rule of thumb, or even drop below it. The most important use of swap for many people is when using suspend-to-disk functionality, in which your RAM's contents are copied to the swap partition. If you plan to use this feature, ensure you've got at least as much swap space as RAM. When doing so, ensure you don't confuse units (GB vs. GiB). Note that RAM comes in GiB units, even though most people use \"GB\" when referring to its size.\n\n*/home partition: The rest. This is pretty basic: Use whatever's left over. OTOH, if you were to run a major server, you might want to split /var off into its own partition, too, which would necessitate determining how much to give to each partition. Given your stated system purpose, I doubt if this will be necessary, unless you'll be running your own mail server -- and even then, if it's for personal use, it's probably not worth splitting off /var unless you send and receive a lot of e-mail.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to display a keyboard map in terminal? I'd like to be able to display a keyboard map in terminal including dead keys - is it possible?\nI wonder if there's, say, ncurses app able to display the keyboard with mappings listed, possibly with dead keys accents. I know already how to find which layout and model I have enabled. If those are modular, like basic layout being one part and dead keys are another (e.g. specified in separate files), I'd be happy enough with getting them separate. I have virtually no knowledge on this sort of internals (which is kinda obvious).\n\nA: Using setxkbmap you can get some information in terminal such as the layout, rules, model, options, keycodes, symbols, etc.\nFor example on my machine typing setxkbmap -print outputs the following:\nxkb_keymap {\n    xkb_keycodes  { include \"evdev+aliases(qwerty)\" };\n    xkb_types     { include \"complete\"  };\n    xkb_compat    { include \"complete\"  };\n    xkb_symbols   { include \"pc+us+gr:2+inet(evdev)+group(alt_shift_toggle)\"    };\n    xkb_geometry  { include \"pc(pc105)\" };\n};\n\nAnd typing setxkbmap -query outputs:\nrules:      evdev\nmodel:      pc105\nlayout:     us,gr\nvariant:    ,\noptions:    grp:alt_shift_toggle\n\n", "Q: Been using Truecrypt, but trying ecryptfs I have been using Truecrypt with a 32gb filesystem to keep important, personal, private files in. \nThe idea is a stranger getting into my system cannot see any of those files, including Chrome cache, passwords, etc.\nWorking well, but I have discovered ecryptfs and am considering using it becuz it doesn't require a fixed size file or filesystem.\nThe way I use Truecrypt is when Gnome starts I get a prompt (/etc/gdm3/*Session files) along with a script to mount my Truecrypt filesystem.\nI would like to do similar for ecryptfs.  Installed it, created my ~/.Private and ~/Private filesystems with ecryptfs-setup-private and it works.\nUnfortunately, it mounts automatically at login - bad.  So, I researched some and see that removing ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase disables that capability.\nBut now ecryptfs-mount-private says \"ERROR: Encrypted private directory is not setup properly\" - bad.\nAlso doing \"sudo mount -t ecryptfs ~/.Private ~.Private\" makes me answer all the same questions as ecryptfs-setup-private - I even created a file ~/.ecryptfsrc with appropriate stuff in it - no workee.\nWhat I would like is for, at Gnome startup, for it to ask me for my (or root) password and my passphrase similar to what Truecrypt does now for me.\nBut, still have to figure out how to get a simple mount or ecryptfs-mount-private to work without hassle before getting there.\nAny similar thoughts or issues?\nThanks,\nJim\n\nA: I am not an eCryptFS expert, to say the least, and I don't use gnome, but I set something like this up.\nRemoving the wrapped passphrase file will cause it not to mount when you log in, but only because it will also make your Private directory cryptographically inaccessible -- the wrapped-passphrase file is the \"real\" passcode that your typed-in passphrase/password decrypts so that the system can in turn decrypt your files. You can even symlink the wrapped passphrase file to some other location, say a removable SD card, so you can remove the card and thus disable the encrypted directory.\nTo disable automatic mounting, the method I used is to remove the .ecryptfs/auto-mount file (I also removed the auto-umount file because it unmounts the directory on session logout -- e.g. if you go to a vterm and log in and then log out, suddenly the directory is gone. You could have e.g. a gnome session script unmount it when you truly \"log out\" of the machine, but i'm the only user, so I don't worry about that.)\nI then run a script that pops up a term window that runs ecryptfs-mount-private which asks for the password to unwrap the wrapped-passphrase file, as you describe.\nIf you actually deleted your wrapped passphrase (as opposed to renaming or moving), you'll have to recreate your Private directory.\nNote that you'll want to make sure your swap space is encrypted as well, lest the OS spool data to that (this breaks hibernation, though, and maybe \"sleep\" as well, don't know.) Read up on \"ecryptfs-setup-swap\" for more. You may also want to encrypt /tmp for similar reasons. I did this (turns /tmp into a ram risk that could spool to swap -- so swap should be encrypted or this is risky):\n\n$ sudo echo \"tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab\n\n...but that's out of scope for this question. Those complications (and the fact that ecryptfs is slower) are part of why people like block-level encryption like TrueCrypt, but I do appreciate the flexibility of ecryptfs.\nPresumably, your wrapped-passphrase file was wrapped using your standard login password when you used the setup wizard. Most people want the encrypted directory to mount automatically for convenience: the files are still encrypted until they login with their password. Your question implies that you want to use a different password for the encrypted files for some reason. To do that, you'll need to change the password used for the wrapped passphrase file. To do that, I believe what you want to do is something like this (untested):\n\n*\n\n*unmount the Private directory\n\n*run:\n\n$ ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\n  \n\n", "Q: Help unmounting a disk image I mounted two iso files with Furius ISO mount, and then, forgetting about them, closed ISO mount, and shut down my laptop. Now, they won't unmount. They say fstab missing/you are not root.\nPlease help?!\n\nA: I had the same problem. Thanks to Braiam I typed mount into the Terminal and checked the mounting point of the unwanted image in the output - in my case it was /home/my_username/the_unwanted_file - and then typed \nsudo umount /home/my_username/the_unwanted_file\n\ninto the Terminal and worked like a charm for me.

I'm going to install Ubuntu as a dual-boot option on my Windows 8 pc. My pc trackpad has multi-touch capability (two-time scroll, etc) and I was wondering, will I still have those multi-touch capabilities when using Ubuntu?\nIf not, will there likely be any gestures at all besides simple tapping? At least something for scrolling??\nI don't know the software brand of my my trackpad and k can't look out up at the moment.\nAny help us greatly appreciated!!!!!!!!! :)\n\nA: As far as I know two finger scrolling should work. It worked on my old Dell just fine on 12.04, and I see no reason for Canonical to get rid of that so it should still be there. Other gestures might be automatically available or its easy enough to install packages like that.\n", "Q: laptop only has ubuntu, how do i delete it and install windows? i bought a asus 1015e laptop with ubuntu as it's OS by accident. i want to delete ubuntu partition and install windows. i went to gparted and i dont know which partition to delete. also asus sells this laptop with windows as well, so i think there is a partition with windows on it already. anyway to delete ubuntu and boot into windows?\nif not do i delete all partitions? thank\nhttp://i.imgur.com/h5C9ovW.jpg?1\nso i boot into windows setup and delete all partitions, then i cant format the HD to install windows, it says cannot install windows, the disk is of GPT partition style. please help.\nif i try to boot to ubuntu it says error: no such partition grub rescue\n\nA: If you have both Windows and Ubuntu installed on your computer, install GRUB: it will give you a menu whenever you boot up your computer and allow you to choose which OS to boot into each time.\nOtherwise, you can just install Windows and during the install it will reformat your hard drive on its own (it deletes everything during the install)\nIf you are curious about the partitions currently on your computer, post any info gparted gives you about them: the number of partitions, their sizes, any identifying names or types... usually you have a main partition and a small swap partition, unless someone made it fancy, or unless you do actually have both Windows and Ubuntu installed already.\n", "Q: Random mac-address every time I turn on my laptop I would like to get a random mac-address automatically every time I turn on my laptop.

I am trying to remove or delete Acrobat 9 which isn't working properly but it isn't showing up in the Synaptic Package so I've located it in a folder called 'home' which is in my downloads folder. The home folder there is locked so I have a couple of questions.\nWhat is that 'home' folder and why is it in the 'downloads' folder?\nHow can I unlock folders to delete them? I'm told that I don't have permission, but it's my computer so why?\n\nA: Problem solved.  I eventually managed to change ownership of that 'home' folder and deleted it. It only contained the Adobe stuff, nothing I needed.\nsudo chown -R $USER: ~/Downloads/home\nrm -r ~/Downloads/home\n\n\nA: If you want to delete it, you'll have to sudo up.

I have a windows 8 installed laptop, and have installed ubuntu, but when I reboot my system, I am given a choice to choose Ubuntu or windows 8, when I choose Ubuntu, the screen loads up and then repeats the question, this cycle is repeated endlessly, please tell me what I am doing wrong.\n\nA: Sounds like windows is still on your hard drive just in a separate partition. Grub is configured, done during the ubuntu install, to let you choose between ubuntu and windows. Grub will boot windows or linux... it is an advance bootloader. If you do not mind windows being on the hard drive then the easiest thing you could do is just edit windows out in the /etc/grub.conf file. Warning: You may create additional  boot problems if that is not done correctly. If this were my computer I would just erase the entire hard drive and install ubuntu thereafter. Windows is taking up uneeded drive space. Many ways to erase the hard drive. This is how I do it. I use the gparted live CD. The live CD is on sourceforge for download. http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php\n\nA: It sounds very much like an issue with uefi settings.

Why has Ubuntu and many other Linux distributions moved the default mount points from /media  to /media/$USER\nExample I plug in a USB drive and it's name is EXT4-250GB-USB it used to show up in /media/EXT4-250GB-USB but now it shows up in /media/z/EXT4-250GB-USB\nWhy is this and what's the reason behind it?\n\nA: In fact, Ubuntu as many other Linux distributions have switched to udisks2 which is used for the auto mount feature.\nIn the new version of udisks, the default mount point is /run/media/$USER, but it has been patched by Ubuntu (and some other distributions) to be /media/$USER (See this answer from Florian Diesch for more details).\nudisks version 2.0.0, which is included in Ubuntu 12.10 doesn't allow you to change the default behaviour which is mounting a file system as non-shared (only accessible by $USER).\nSince udisks 2.0.91, it is possible to change the default behaviour so that mounting a file system as shared can be done as before [/media] (See this answer from rocko for more details).\nThe root cause for this change of default behaviour in udisks2 seems clear : the security. It is safer to restrict access to a file system to one particular user instead of giving access to it to all the users of the system.\n\nA: In Ubuntu this has been changed once with Quantal (12.10) release. The reason seems to be quite simple and logic:\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, in Linux like systems /media is a directory for mounting files systems on removable media like CD-ROM drives, floppy disks, and Zip drives. So, this is a rule.\n\n*Now, if you plug an USB drive for example, normally is that only you to have access to that USB drive - from here the reason of per-user mounting. In your example if you check with ls -l /media/z you will see that you are the owner of EXT4-250GB-USB and only (aka z user) you have permissions to read, write and execute EXT4-250GB-USB. The same thing is true for all the files from inside EXT4-250GB-USB.\n\n*In this way, a system administrator (root) can see quickly what each user has mounted.\nAnyway, if you wish, you can manually mount something almost where you want (of course, where you will be granted access). For example, you will not be able to mount to /media/<anotheruser>.\nYou may be also interested by: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I let other users access my /media/[username]/HARDDRIVE with Ubuntu 12.10?\n\n*How to configure the default automount location?\n", "Q: How to properly uninstall Ubuntu from dual boot?

I've installed Ubuntu and ddrescue with the intention of recovering all data from the C drive (200GB); so far it's been about 2 hours and I think it's going to be a very long time.\nI ran the following line:\nsudo dd_rescue /dev/sdb2 /mnt/sda4/backup.img\n\nThings started looking good; it expected to retrieve 195354624kB from /dev/sdb2 and started copying stuff; however it's copying in chunks of 2119808kB with avg.rate of just above 400kB/s and an ETA of almost 130:00:00. I have to wait 5 days just to get all my data out?!\nThis webpage says that he took just 12+h to do 1TB, but given that my hard disk is damaged I should expect the time taken to be longer. Should I be optimistic and pray that it'd take less than 5 days? Currently the state of the hard disk is so bad that I can't view any of the files in Windows, the C drive says it's corrupted and unreadable, and the D drive hangs up the system when navigating through the files, and eventually disconnects each and every single time.\nIs there any way to expedite ddrescue (while preserving as much data as possible), or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: If you use ddrescue command from gddrescue package (it's not clear), then to speed up the process (and ensure your drive doesn't die too quickly!) you can use a log file: \nsudo ddrescue /dev/sdb2 /mnt/sda4/backup.img logfile\n\nAfter a couple of ours (or a day) of copying, you can stop ddrescue, let your drive rest (or put it in a colder room or storage), and when it's cooled down you can resume the process where it left off using the same command as above. Since the hard-drive will have time to breath, it will improve operational performance and might speed up the process. It is recommended to do that if the drive is dying.\n\nA: What is the file system of the hard disk where you save the rescue image and the logfile? I just made the experience of rescuing a 500GB internal hard drive (connected via SATA) on a Laptop running Linux Mint from a USB Stick, saving the rescue image and logfile on an exFat formatted USB hard drive. \nIt starting rather slowly (1-2MB/sec) but after around 250GB it was only crawling at <100KB/sec. It seemed to become slower the larger the rescue image file was growing.\nThen I moved the rescue image and logfile to another temporary place, re-formatted the USB hard drive with the ext4 file system, moved the files back on it and resumed the ddrescue process - and now it runs with 1-20MB/sec again (fluctuating but around 7MB/sec on average)!\nSeems like exFat does not play very well with very large files (several hundred gigabytes), so you might want to give ext4 a shot.\n", "Q: driver print brother DCP-195C ubuntu 13.04 32 bits I have a Brother DCP-195C printer ubuntu 13.04 32-bit scanner works but the printer does not print works but there is nothing on the paper out of the printer\n\nA: I'd comment this, but don't have the rep points so I'll do my best to answer your question:\nI hate to ask, but does your printer have ink?  are the inkjet heads clean and clog free?\nIf you are sure that that are I'd try to print a test page via the printers internal software so that you can verify that the printer it self is okay.

See the image below.\n\nP.S. When I try to get the output of tcpdump on a normal file it does it easily so I believe the pipe is not working here. Please Help.\nEDIT 1\n1.I have checked the permission of the pipe and set it to full permissions for now.\n2.I have created the pipe on my machine at ip 192.168.0.1 do I have to configure anything at the machine on 192.168.0.2\nEDIT 2\nComment on the tutorial website by one of the user I'm having the same problem.\ni tried to run it on my openwrt box, from ubuntu 10.10, but when i execute the command\nssh root@192.168.1.1 -p 443 “tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -U -w – not port 443″ > /tmp/pipes/cap_fw\nnothing happens (it should ask me the pw i suppose, but it doesn’t), it acts like if i didn’t press Return…\nthe dropbear daemon is running on port 443 with pw login (no certificate)\nAlso he added later\nit was only a problem of not using certificates with ssh, now it works correctly\nthanks!\nIs this really the case of not using certificates as I too am not using any certificates for ssh.\n\nA: The output  of ssh root@192.168.0.2 \"tcpdump -s 0 -U -n -w - -i eth0 > /tmp/pipies/cap_fw command is redirected to the named pipe (/tmp/pipies/cap_fw). Thus, you will not see absolutely nothing in terminal when the process begin. So, it's a normal behavior.\nTherefore, let like this the current open terminal to send signals to the pipe and open a new terminal or a new tab in terminal and go to the step 3 from your tutorial. When you will start wireshark -k -i /tmp/pipes/cap_fw in second (tab) terminal, you will be asked for password in first (tab) terminal. So, enter your password to continue.\nLook also at the image from your tutorial to understand better. \nSee also: Using Named Pipes (FIFOs) with Bash\n", "Q: Command tab completion of arguments from folder Is it possible to create a list of completions for a command based on some folder's files?\nSay I want to run Sublime Text 2 on one of my projects, which are saved as ~/sublime_projects/*.sublime-project.

That setting was probably set to install GRUB on the root partition (/) you chose, and not on the MBR. In turn, your Ubuntu installed successfully, but the current bootloader (the Windows bootloader) does not know anything about Ubuntu. You'll need to add an entry to the Windows bootloader to tell it \"Hey look!

If you just add tabs and spaces, there's very little risk that you'll corrupt the file.\n\nA: The other commands you mentioned may indeed display properly formatted data, but cat simply displays a file (in this case /etc/fstab), and if the file is not nicely formatted, cat won't make it prettier.\nIf you care about this, you might use an editor and align the columns manually in /etc/fstab, say sudo nano /etc/fstab.

Why is the Ubuntu 12LTS 4MB bigger than all the blank CDs I have?  I had to burn it on to a DVD.  This never used to be the case.\n\nA: It depends on architecture of your system for which you are installing Ubuntu.\nIf your system is 32 bit then Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bit CD image comes under 700 MB.\nBut if your system is of 64 bit architecture then Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit CD image crosses 700 or 750 MB.\nOther higher versions of Ubuntu 32bit & 64bit CD images even cross 800 MB. Thus require a DVD. Eg. Ubuntu 13.04 CD image is around 850 MB.\nFollowing link may help you why it is so:\nKernels with Ubuntu LTS Enablement Stack\n\nA: Appart of the difference between architecture, Ubuntu team was struggling to decide what software is preferable to ship into the Live CD.

For that they made the mini.iso which is a text based installer (alá Debian) for the system. If you are looking into <700MB images, give the mini.iso a try.

In some cases you know the name of a binary needed (like when you are reading a tutorial and need some command not installed in your OS) but do not know what package it comes with.\nAlso, dpkg -S QUERY lists installed packages which provide files containing 'QUERY' in their names. In some cases you have a binary or script installed on one machine and want it also on another one, but do not remember where it came from. The output should be smaller than for apt-file in this case, as it does not display content of packages not installed.\nYou may filter output of those commands with egrep, say with egrep '/NAME$'. \ne.g. dpkg -S ps | egrep '/bin/ps$' tells us that ps binary comes with procps package.\n\nA: In the command line you can use\napt-cache search SearchTerm\n\nOf course you have to change \"SearchTerm\" to the piece of text you already know. But there is also a webinterface for searching packages under Ubuntu packages. I think the search function of the Ubuntu Software Center may be helpful.\n", "Q: Blank screen after first login 13.04; mouse visible Just installed 13.04 32 bit on a thinkpad r32.

I've recently got it running 12.04 from 10.x, and everything seems to be working brilliantly.\nUnfortunately though, it only seems to boot to the GUI when a screen is attached, and drops to TUI when there isn't. Since I mostly log into it via RDP, I'd rather it booted to GUI regardless of whether it has it's own screen plugged in or not.\nIs there a setting I can change somewhere to disable TUI boot?\n\nA: You can try the command startx or sudo service lightdm start (whichever works) after logging in to start a GUI. If the startx this doesn't exist you should install it by sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.\nTo start it at login, you could add a .desktop file to /xdg/etc/autostart to run the command.\nFrom here: https://askubuntu.com/a/202274/176889\n", "Q: do i need to reinstall all my softwares after upgrading ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04? i was stopped by my sister from upgrading Ubuntu, for the reason she explained was that i would have to reinstall all the softwares that I've installed in last 6 months.\nbut i think if that's the case, the upgrade itself includes all softwares that i have installed.\nso please tell me what's the truth?\n\nplease note that i just can't afford mentally to reinstall all apps due to slow INTERNET speed.because it may take 3 to 4 days of constant downloading.\n  if you are an Indian living in an suburban city,you can understand my situation.\n\ni think the question itself explains everything.still I'll explain everything in detail.i want to upgrade my current Ubuntu 12.10 OS to 13.10(now please don't ask what is 13.10). this option is available from \"about this computer\" and many other places.the upgrade is of about 700mb to 800 MB.  \nBTW, i don't know why i think it's a rule here to put some question on questions asked here,however detailed or/and simple it may be.at least that's what i feel after looking at many questions.\n\nA: Bottom line is that you will upgrade, some things will break, some things will need additional drivers. The video driver alone for me was 124 Meg alone, I'm sure on a slow connection that can take a few hours.\nDon't upgrade, its not worth it UNLESS you have problems and hope it will fix them with an upgrade. But if your computer is working. Stay away, its just not worth it.\n\nA: What do you mean of upgrade?\nIf you mean the upgrade from Software Updater, no, it keeps all of your softwares and packages installed. However there’s a high risk of data loss, and also you need to download more than 700-800 MB which may be impossible for you. \nAccording to the documentation:\n\nRenewing the Installation without formatting the partitions (in contrast to upgrading), will also keep the personal data and configurations under /home but will renew all system settings under /etc as well as the default set of installed packages.\n\nBut if you mean a fresh installation with formatting the drive, yes, you should install all apps again. However you can keep your settings and personal data under /home if you have it on a separated partition.\nMore information on how to upgrade: Raring Upgrades\n\nA: If you want to upgrade, then use\ndo-release-upgrade from terminal\nor\nupdate from update manager\nor\nfrom an iso image (offline n safer option...in case u drop internet connection in between)\nu will not have to reinstall any software\nif you fresh install overwriting the previous version,\nthen you have to reinstall all the software\n", "Q: i cant boot into lubuntu grub wont show up I have recently installed Lubuntu as a dual boot system with windows 8 and now it just default boots to windows.

It's very rare for a ISO image not to boot unless your computer is a very old model. I have booted from iMacs, MacBooks and regular PC's with no issues. Some old bios have issues booting from USB's but from a DVD is rare.\nWhen you write the DVD, after you have burned it, pull it out and then stick it back into the computer to see if you see some files on the DVD, if you don't see any files it probably means you burnt it wrong.

So, to install the Ubuntu SDK package, the correct command is this:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk\n\n\nExplanation of the error you got:\nWhat you probably did in the terminal is this:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu sdk\n\nThis means: install a package called ubuntu and a package called sdk. You put a space between the names, this indicates that you want to install two packages called ubuntu and sdk, but since there are no packages called that, you got the error unable to locate <package>.\nYou can search for the package names before you try to install. For example, you can use this command: apt-cache search ubuntu sdk, here's the output:\nalaa@aa-lu:~$ apt-cache search ubuntu sdk\nubuntu-sdk - Ubuntu SDK\nalaa@aa-lu:~$\n\nThis indicates that the package name is ubuntu-sdk, and that's what you use when you try to install.\n", "Q: ibus 1.4.1 doesn't work with Opera 12 Environment:\nUbuntu 12.04\nOpera 12\nibus 1.4.1\nI've installed ibus-qt and add the two lines below in /usr/bin/opera, but it makes no difference:\nQT_IM_MODULE=xim\nXMODIFIERS=\"@im=ibus\"\n\nAs some say that QT has been deprecated in Opera, so I've also added GTK_IM_MODULE=xim in Opera, but still no difference.\nAm I missing something or we just can't use ibus in Opera 12?\n\nA: OK,now I figure it out...\nIt turns out that I need to start ibus with parameter -x so that XIM starts up.\nI added these lines to ~/.bashrc:\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus\nexport XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus\nexport XIM=ibus\nexport QT_IM_MODULE=ibus\nexport XIM_ARGS=\"ibus-daemon -d -x\"\n\nThen I modified the startup applications, ibus-daemon -dxr\nThe last step, modify the /usr/bin/opera, add\nGTK_IM_MODULE=xim\nQT_IM_MODULE=xim\nXMODIFIERS=\"@im=ibus\"\n\nIt works like a charm...

I didn't know that multiverse package are not completely free.\nAs in the question to the first answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can a restricted/multiverse package be found?\n\n*How can those packages be purchased?\n\n\nA: Free here means free as in freedom, not free as in free beer. Non-free packages do not necessarily need to be purchased, but they put restriction on your freedom.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*faac (multiverse): this is an open-source library that lets you listen to FAAC audio files. The problem with the FAAC format is protected by patents. From Wikipedia:\n\nThose intending to use this software module in hardware or software products are advised that this use may infringe existing patents.\n\n\n*nvidia-graphics-drivers-173 (restricted): this is one of the many nvidia drivers. The problem with them is that they are not open source, hence they can't be free software.\nNone of the packages in the restricted or multiverse repositories have a price.\nBy the way, Ubuntu offers software for purchase, but you can get it only with the Ubuntu Software Center, not with the official repositories.\n\nA: If you would like to revise your installed packages from the point of view of free software, I recommend using the vrms (\"virtual Richard M.

I want to install Ubuntu, therefore, I want to partition a disk using standard windows 8 utility for that. However, what file system do I have to format it to: extFAT or NTFS? Or I don't have to format it to any file system, perhaps? \n\nA: Update for Ubuntu 18.04 and above\nNew installations of recent versions of Ubuntu does not use a separate swap partition any more. They use a swap file by default.\nGeneral Information\nUbuntu usually needs two partitions to work well. Partition formats like NTFS and exFat are not suitable for Ubuntu as these formats do not store file and folder permissions and ownership information in the form Ubuntu can use.\nRecomendations\nShrink the existing partition(s) and leave the space unallocated in Windows 8. Or if you have already created a partition for Ubuntu, delete it. The space should then be unallocated in Windows 8.\nWhen you start the Ubuntu install, it will find the empty (unallocated) space and create two partitions, the main one will be mounted as / and formatted ext4 and there will be a small 2-4GB swap partition with its own swap format.\nMore Information\nSee Ubuntu installation on Windows7 with D partition for more explanations about partitions in Ubuntu, mount points etc.\nSee How do I install Ubuntu alongside a pre-installed Windows with UEFI? for details about dealing with UEFI, secure-boot and other Windows 8 specific problems.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I recommend using ext4 with Ubuntu, since its the default.  Ext4 is made to increase storage size and increase performance of the filesystem. \nThis will tell you all you need to know about ext4, but I do recommend using it.\nTake a look at Install Ubuntu 13.04.  Actuality during the Ubuntu installation you have the option to install alongside Windows 8.\n\nFor 12.04, if you don't see the option to Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 (probably won't), then make sure that you have the partition ready, in windows before hand (it doesn't have to be formatted), and choose something else.  You will have the option to create the needed Ubuntu partitions,  create two partitions: the first for /, the root directory, and the second for Swap.\n", "Q: Starting over on a new laptop My old laptop crash and was not able to retrieve anything from hard drive.

I've tried every solution I can find on google.\n\nA: When you do not want to use DHCP and/or want NetworkManager to ignore some interface that you want to manage manually, just provide a configuration via /etc/network/interfaces. The interface will then be ignored by NetworkManager. See \n$ man interfaces\n\nfor further info on how to configure interfaces manually. This is a template file (snippet) that configures the interface eth0:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n  address 192.168.0.10\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  gateway 192.168.0.1\n  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\n\nObviously you need to change the IP addresses. Note that the last line is evaluated by resolconf (it's a package/program, I don't mean the resolv.conf file), when and only when the interface is brought up successfully. You can check if the interface is up with /sbin/ifconfig. That should output the keyword UP and the IP somewhere. gateway in the above snippet denotes the IP of your router. Check if this ip appears in your route with the command route -n. Then ping your router. If that works, then you could ping 8.8.8.8. If that works check if the DNS correctly appears in the /etc/resolv.conf file. If it does, then check if you can resolve DNS names. In that order. If something in betweens fails, it is not a problem with your DNS. \nIf you're not able to get this straight using /etc/network/interfaces (package ifupdown) and want to know how to bring up an interface with basic commands, drop a comment. \nThen you need to investigate how the trouble started in the first place. You've learnt already that you first need to clarify that your machine is able to ping 8.8.8.8 before you conclude to an error at resolving DNS though that server. If all that works fine, but the resolver entry just doesn't get tranfered correctly from /etc/network/interfaces to /etc/resolv.conf then continue your research at the documentation of the package resolvconf. \nCONCLUSION: \nDo not deinstall your dhcp software, when you depend on the internet connection and have few experiences on how to configure an interface manually. There are a lot of high level packages involved with bringing up an interface, namely network-manager, ifupdown and resolvconf and others. Which one does what is not obvious. ;)\n\nA: This is not an issue with the DNS, but with the overall internet connection for your VM. \nThis should be an issue with how you are providing the network connection to the VM client via the host. Explore the possible solutions more with that bend. If it was only an issue with the DNS, your pings would succeed. \nTry to make the connection on the VM to NAT rather than to bridge it. See if the connectivity comes up. Once you have the connection to the internet, the DNS should work just fine.\n", "Q: How can I serve files via apache2 from an internal ntfs partition using fstab ntfs-3g?

Now you can add a Host-Entry in you ssh config:\nvim ~/.ssh/config\n\nAnd add:\nHost github.com\n    LogLevel DEBUG3\n\nOn using git operations, you should get plenty of debug messages, now. To get lesser debug messages, try using DEBUG1\nFor GIT versions >= 2.3.0 see the answer from @Flimm for a smarter solution.\n\nA: Per man ssh:\n -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh to print debugging messages about its progress.  This\n         is helpful in debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.\n         Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.\n\nSo, try ssh -v. If that doesn't tell you what you need to know, you can add one or two vs for even more detailed debugging information. For Github in particular, try ssh -vvvT git@github.com.\nUsually, in my experience, an SSH session hanging during setup happens when the client can't complete the chosen authentication method. Check that your private key is in the right place with the right permissions and matches the public key you've given Github.\n\nA: I don't see a way to tell git(1) the external command to use for ssh(1), but as a workaround, simply rename /path/to/ssh to /path/to/ssh.orig, create a shell script wrapper /path/to/ssh, and add in the -v flags:\n$ sudo mv /usr/bin/ssh /usr/bin/ssh.orig\n$ sudo vim /usr/bin/ssh\n$ cat /usr/bin/ssh\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -x /usr/bin/ssh.orig ]; then\n    exec /usr/bin/ssh.orig -v -v -v \"${@}\"\nfi\n\n$ sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/ssh\n\nI get verbose output when executing git commands operating over an ssh transport.  Once done debugging, delete the script and restore /path/to/ssh.orig to /path/to/ssh.\n\nA: Environment variable\nFrom Git version 2.3.0, you can use the environment variable GIT_SSH_COMMAND and pass the -v verbose argument like this:\nGIT_SSH_COMMAND=\"ssh -v\" git clone example\n\nTo be extra verbose, make it -vvv:\nGIT_SSH_COMMAND=\"ssh -vvv\" git clone example\n\nGit config\nFrom Git version 2.10.0, which will in Ubuntu 17.04's repos, you can save this configuration globally, or per repo as in this example:\ngit config core.sshCommand \"ssh -vvv\"\ngit pull\n\n\nA: Reading through man git, there are some useful environmental variables you can set, GIT_TRACE_PACKET and GIT_TRACE. For example:\nGIT_TRACE_PACKET=true git clone ssh://[...]\n\nA bit late to the game, but hopefully this helps someone!\n", "Q: PDF security problem I'm looking for a program that allows me to export a document to PDF safely, so that other users can open it but can not copy or print its contents.\nWhile I used Windows I used PDF printers such as PDF24 and BullZip, which allowed me to create documents with these characteristics.

Today I checked this tutorial: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtquick/qtquick-internationalization.html where they use another technique (qsTr).\nWhat is the difference between the two? What makes one better than the other in some situations?\n\nA: The qsTr() method uses the standard Qt translations support, which is not using gettext. The i18n.tr() method is from the Ubuntu SDK and is a wrapper around gettext. Many internationalization features in Ubuntu, and Linux distributions in general, are built around the GNU gettext system, and so using it provides the ability to use more tools and integrate better with other parts of the system, while the Qt translations system is specific to Qt.\n", "Q: Proxy settings not working in ubuntu12.04 but working fine with windows 7 Proxy authentication settings are set properly in the /etc/apt/apt.conf and even in the network settings.

Have fun watching footbal on TV with your friends!\nPsst! Have you tried by simply dragging the football match window on the second screen?\n\nA: If having the same display on your laptop and your TV really is what you want, you can set up mirroring – see the linked answer: How to make ubuntu run as one screen on both laptop monitor and TV\nMirroring has the drawback that not all resolutions are necessarily available. Therefore, I'd suggest dragging the stream to the TV.\nIf you felt like the TV was inaccessible, you just have to make sure you find the right \"connection\" to exit one screen and enter the other. Usually, you just move the mouse to the right and see it disappear on one screen while it reappears on the second. However, if your second screen has a lower vertical resolution than your first screen, not all of your left screen's right edge will be aligned with your second screen. (This is visualized in this discussion: https://superuser.com/questions/281176/mouse-gets-stuck-in-lower-edge-of-screen-on-portrait-oriented-window)\nAlso note that your TV most likely will be initially aligned to your laptop monitor's right edge, regardless of where your TV is physically located.\n", "Q: Openswan's ipsec verify fails on \"Two or more interfaces found, checking IP forwarding\" I'm trying to set an L2TP/IPsec VPN.

The folks who compiled the package version 1.69 that is provided for download at google code site did a poor job. That package breaks .deb packaging standards in several ways. \npidgin-data version 1:2.10.7-0ubuntu4.1 which is installed on Raring by default and that triggers the error, explicitly states in its control that it Breaks: pidgin-facebookchat (<< 1.69-2) which you were trying to install (1.69). That fact is reflected in the error message you get. Pidgin-data's package control also states that it Replaces: pidgin-facebookchat (<< 1.69-2) which means that it replaces some files from the pidgin-facebookchat package you try to install, i.e. there is a clear conflict. \nSince the 3rd party packages is broken there is no trivial way to straighten this up, except luckily there is an Ubuntu packaged version 1.69-2.1ubuntu1.  \nACTION:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get rid of the 3rd party package. \n\n*Install the Ubuntu package provided by the default channel. \n\n*Repair the dpkg system on the go if needed.\n\n\nThat should be done by simply ...\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install pidgin-facebookchat\n\nMaybe you need to remove the faulty package with dpkg -r pidgin-facebookchat first. Also some dpkg --configure -a, apt-get -f install could be needed. But just the two lines above should do it. If your dpkg system got too much confused, additional investigation may be needed. \nCONCLUSION: \nWhen you find a fancy software package, first look after versions provided by the channels provided by Ubuntu or a PPA. Chances are that packages out of the wild break your system. ;)\n", "Q: How can I install a Synaptics pointing driver?

I've got one question regarding Ubuntu Juju deployment, on AWS cloud. I'm using Bash to write my hooks. At the end of the install hook/script, I have lines that expose some of my TCP ports(80,443,5666 etc)\nSyntax:\nopen-port 80/tcp\nopen-port 443/tcp\n\nMy question is how can I expose ICMP ports in a similar manner? ICMP ECHO request, ICMP ECHO reply is what I need.\nThe reason for this is that we use Nagios for monitoring of our EC2 instances. Alarms fire off right away, complaining that instance is not reachable, since Nagios relies on ICMP for basic remote host check.\n\nA: You can't. \nJuju in AWS uses EC2 security groups. Though the security groups can be made to allow ICMP with the EC2 API or Console, there are no hooks anywhere in the Juju code to do so. The only hooks that exist are for TCP and UDP. \nIf you have access to the EC2 console, you can find the relevant security group and allow ICMP there. \nOr, if you have the credentials configured for the ec2-api-tools, you can use a command like: \nec2-authorize <group> -P icmp -t -1:-1 -s 0.0.0.0/0\nIn Juju bug 833064, they mention an intent to switch to machine-level firewalling (iptables on the instance) rather than continuing to limit themselves to the platform's firewalling capabilities and APIs. \n", "Q: Why can't I browse internet while downloading torrent or updates?

I experienced same issue in Linux Mint 15 as well.\nHaven't had this issue in Windows though.\nCan somebody help me understand why it happens in Linux?\n\nA: Maybe this is because downloading torrents/packages uses all of your download bandwidth. You can try to investigate this by limiting the download/upload speed in yout bittorrent client. In the Transmission client you can find this in the menus via Edit -> Preferences -> Speed. \nSee the answer to This question for information on how to throttle the bandwidth usage of apt, the package manangement software.\n\nA: In most of the times it is not Operating System's error, it is the torrent client that saturates your connection.\nI have faced many times this problem on Linux machines and with various clients Transmission, Deluge, etc.\nThe solution is to optimize your client according to your connection. There is a guide I always follow when I setup a new system.\nCheck the following, they are from the same website:\n\n\n*\n\n*Optimizing Transmission\n\n*Optimizing μTorrent\n\n*Optimizing Deluge\nI take it that your internet connection is not very fast and this causes problems not only with Torrent clients but while apt is running for updates/upgrades and installs.

I have an old mac laptop I want to use for my programming only, it is pretty old so i would rather run a cmd on it rather than an entire OS. Or if anyone has other suggestions that would be great as well, this is just a mobile lap top that i carry with me and would be great if i can upload all the work on it to my main machine. \n\nA: I don't think I compeletely understand what you mean. Where does Ubuntu server run? On the laptop or on the desktop? I guess you want to install Ubuntu server on the laptop, right?\nAnyway, if that is the case, then yes, you can compile from Ubuntu server. For most cases installing the build-essential package will install everything you need to compile a c++ application. Of course, you may need to install more libraries, e.g. if you are writing a GUI application. \nAs for getting the files back to your desktop, why not try using sshfs or NFS? I guess ubuntu one would also work, but I've not tried to use it on a command line only setup. \n\nA: From the build-essential package contents, taken from http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/build-essential,\nthe package build-essential contains the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.5)\nDebian package development tools\n\n*g++ (>= 4:4.4.3)\nGNU C++ compiler (This is what you want for C++ compilations)\n\n*gcc (>= 4:4.4.3)\nGNU C compiler\n\n*libc6-dev\nEmbedded GNU C Library: Development Libraries and Header Files\nor libc-dev\nvirtual package provided by libc6-dev\n\n*make\nAn utility for Directing compilation.\n\n\nBy installing this package you will be able to use the GNU C and C++ compilers. So nothing can stop you from compiling code. \nNote that there is a packaged version of build-essentials for every Ubuntu version.\nVim does not depends of UI components and runs using the terminal window. \nAs for other lightweight recommendations for an old machine, it depends of the specs of the machine. \nYou can check the following window managers - desktop environments if meet your requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*LXDE‎\n\n*Xfce\n\n*Fluxbox\n\n*IceWM\n", "Q: Mousepad \"Lock when hit\" All right, I don't know how to say this, but I will try my best!\nWhen i used Windows 7, I could touch my mousepad and \"emulate\" a left-click, but when I do this in Ubuntu, the mousepad temporarily locks, so the mouse wouldn't move. \nSo now, I am looking to be able to do the same thing in Ubuntu, but I can't seem to find it :( I think what did was the Synaptics driver, so maybe its impossible, just wanted to try the luck with the largest Linux community ^^\nEDIT: Okay, maybe I didn't explain it well enough :P I am looking for a function which makes the mouse stay still when I tap on the mousepad, because the way it is now, I have the mouse over the desired button, but when I tap the mousepad, the mouse moves slightly, which can be a problem :P\n\nA: If you open Ubuntu Software Center then search for and install synaptiks this will give you options to left click by clicking on a corner of your touchpad.\n\nI hope this helps\nUPDATE\nThe only way that may work that I can think of is to set the pointer speed as follows\n\nThis should make the movement very slow when the mouse is stationary, but accelerates to a sensible speed when it is moved.\n", "Q: How to run parallel make with debuild? I am trying to make a package of a piece of software that I've (co-) written. I'm using \ndebuild -i -us -uc -b \n\nAnd in principle that works fine. In order to shorten compilation time I'd like to debuild to run make in parallel (like I normally do by running make -j4, for example).\nI've found a few locations on the web that suggest the following:\ndebuild -eDEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=\"parallel=4\" -us -uc -b\ndebuild -j4 -us -uc -b\n\nAnother site suggested to add some code to the debian/rules file that basically sets\nMAKEFLAGS += -j4\n\nHowever, none of these seems to work. Have I missed something? or should I change something in the autoconf/automake settings of the source?\n\nA: It has to be enabled in debian/rules. If the package uses dh, there is a line like this in debian/rules:\ndh $@\n\nChange that to \ndh $@ --parallel\n\nThen your commands will work, at least DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=\"parallel=4\"\n\nA: With debhelper 10, you no longer need to supply the --parallel option in debian/rules; it now runs parallel builds by default.  See the release notes\nThe answer, is therefore, just to set the contents of debian/compat to 10 and to update the debhelper version to >=10 in debian/control.\n\nA: I recommend using the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable, as described in section 4.9.1 of the Debian Policy Manual.\nDEB_BUILD_OPTIONS='parallel=4' debuild -i -us -uc -b\n\n\nA: To sum-up all the above, that worked for me:\nexport DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS='parallel=16'\nfakeroot debian/rules binary\n\n", "Q: apt-add-repository raises an error I’m trying to install JDE (Java Development Environment), but apt-get fails with the following error:\nme@ubuntu:~/$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nYou are about to add the following PPA to your system:\n  Oracle Java (JDK) Installer (automatically downloads and installs Oracle JDK6 /    JDK7 / JDK8).

I was able to install and dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.04 (both x64) just a while ago. As a newbie in Ubuntu, I'm still searching for ways to install my games because I'm planning to make Ubuntu my main OS because it's like really cool and smooth and uses less resources.\nSo, I was wondering if there are softwares that are similar to ThrottleStop. I need it because my Laptop throttles upon reaching 75C (processor). I play heavy games so, I need to stop it from throttling. Of course I'm not trying to kill my laptop. I adjust my multiplier so that it wont reach as much as 95C. Nothing much I can do. I'm just making the most out of my Laptop since I can't buy a new one yet. I don't have a job :| I'm still just a student.\nAnyways, Is there any software similar to ThrottleStop so that I can adjust the multiplier and disable throttling.\n\nA: MSR 0x1FC - bit[0] is where BD PROCHOT is hiding.\nYou would need to write some simple code to read this register, clear only that one bit and then write the results back to the same 0x1FC register.\nHere is some C/C++ code that ThrottleStop uses to turn off BD PROCHOT\nDWORD dwEAX, dwEDX;\n\nReadmsr( 0x1FC, &dwEAX, &dwEDX );\n\n// save all of the original bits in that register and only clear bit[0]\n\ndwEAX = dwEAX & 0xFFFFFFFE;  \n\nWritemsr( 0x1FC, dwEAX, dwEDX );\n\nI don't ever use Linux but I know writing some simple code like this should not be too difficult.  To turn BD PROCHOT back on you would just replace the middle line in that code with:\ndwEAX = dwEAX | 0x1;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*where that | line means \"OR\"\n\n\nSend me an email if you need some more help.  The address is in the About... box of ThrottleStop or RealTemp.\nEdit: The WinRing0 software I am using has dwEAX and dwEDX reversed in that routine.  dwEDX refers to the high 32 bits in that MSR and dwEAX contains the lower 32 bits. \n\nA: I came across the same problem and I found a solution which works for me.\nYou'll have to download cpufrequtils.\n\nRun every command in Terminal:\nNote: The '-c' argument is for core number.

You need Python and Python-PIP but it's otherwise pretty straightforward.\n\nA: ThrottleStop writes data to the multiplier request register.  This is MSR 0x199.  You should be able to write a simple batch file that writes the same data to this register when you are using Linux.\nYou can use the MSR Tool to see what values ThrottleStop is writing to this register.\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/myjkxzkzzmd/MSR.zip\nIt lets you read and write data to various CPU registers in Windows.  Doing the same thing should be doable in Linux.  Setting a multiplier in MSR 0x199 that is less than the default maximum should allow you to slow your CPU down which will reduce how much heat it puts out.  That's all the ThrottleStop - Set Multiplier feature does.  Clock modulation is hiding in MSR 0x19A.  Using that register is useful on the 2nd and 3rd Gen Core i CPUs when your goal is to limit heat output.\n\nA: There is now a new cmdline utility for linux with some features in it.

When I use the terminal, upon starting up software-center a long error message is printed to the terminal (yes, an apparently identical traceback is printed twice): \n2013-08-25 12:38:50,829 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.app - INFO - setting up proxy 'None'\n2013-08-25 12:38:50,833 - softwarecenter.db.database - INFO - open() database: path=None use_axi=True use_agent=True\n2013-08-25 12:38:51,079 - softwarecenter.backend.reviews - WARNING - Could not get usefulness from server, no username in config file\n2013-08-25 12:38:51,178 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.app - INFO - show_available_packages: search_text is '', app is None.\n2013-08-25 12:38:51,181 - softwarecenter.db.pkginfo_impl.aptcache - INFO - aptcache.open()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/connection.py\", line 607, in msg_reply_handler\n*message.get_args_list()))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/bus.py\", line 69, in error_cb\ncallback('')\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/backend/installbackend_impl/aptd.py\", line 153, in _register_active_transactions_watch\napt_daemon = client.get_aptdaemon(bus=bus)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aptdaemon/client.py\", line 1696, in get_aptdaemon\nFalse),\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/bus.py\", line 241, in get_object\nfollow_name_owner_changes=follow_name_owner_changes)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/proxies.py\", line 248, in __init__\nself._named_service = conn.activate_name_owner(bus_name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/bus.py\", line 180, in activate_name_owner\nself.start_service_by_name(bus_name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/bus.py\", line 278, in start_service_by_name\n'su', (bus_name, flags)))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/connection.py\", line 651, in call_blocking\nmessage, timeout)\ndbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Spawn.ChildExited: Launch helper exited with unknown return code 1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/connection.py\", line 607, in msg_reply_handler\n*message.get_args_list()))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/bus.py\", line 69, in error_cb\ncallback('')\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/backend/installbackend_impl/aptd.py\", line 153, in _register_active_transactions_watch\napt_daemon = client.get_aptdaemon(bus=bus)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aptdaemon/client.py\", line 1696, in get_aptdaemon\nFalse),\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/bus.py\", line 241, in get_object\nfollow_name_owner_changes=follow_name_owner_changes)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/proxies.py\", line 248, in __init__\nself._named_service = conn.activate_name_owner(bus_name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/bus.py\", line 180, in activate_name_owner\nself.start_service_by_name(bus_name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/bus.py\", line 278, in start_service_by_name\n'su', (bus_name, flags)))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dbus/connection.py\", line 651, in call_blocking\nmessage, timeout)\ndbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Spawn.ChildExited: Launch helper exited with unknown return code 1\n2013-08-25 12:38:53,215 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.widgets.exhibits - WARNING - download failed: '<class 'gi._glib.GError'>', 'Operation not supported'\n\nAny suggestions?\nEDIT: After searching some more, I found this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+bug/1085425\nIt describes symptoms similar to mine, and I found that when I ran\n/usr/lib/ubuntu-sso-client/ubuntu-sso-login\n\nas described there, I got a series of error messages, ending with:\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\n\nI then found this stackoverflow thread: \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7446187/no-module-named-pkg-resources\nwhere I was able to use the top comment to re-install setuptools, which fixed my problem.\n\nA: Try these:\nOpen terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and execute following commands:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get --purge remove\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nAbove commands will try to fix broken packages if any and also install required library files if missed accidentally.\nIf still it does not work then only thing you can do is to use some other Package Manager, best is Synaptic Package Manager.

For each customer I get that wants to host a website on my server I create a user and add it to a group called 'customers'. All of these customers get a private folder in my /home/ folder,  in which there is a folder tree that should not be deleted. So let's say that one of my customers' name is bob. He will get /home/bob/ as his private folder, but that folder should also contain a folder tree like this:\n/home/bob/\n     |\n     |-> /www/\n         |\n         |-> /bobsdomain.com/\n         |              |\n         |              |-> /public_html/\n         |              |-> /cgi_bin/\n         |\n         |-> /bobsotherdomain.com/\n                        |\n                        |-> /public_html/\n                        |-> /cgi_bin/\n\nBob should obviously be the owner of /home/bob because otherwise bob couldn't create or delete files and folders inside his home folder. However, everything between /www/ and /public_html/ or /cgi_bin/ should never be removed. Everything from /public_html/ or /cgi_bin/ and down should be bob's choice wether he wants to delete it or not. \nIn order to do this, could I just set the folders between /www/ and /public_html/ or /cgi_bin/ as property of root, or would that cause bob being unable to add files to the /public_html/ and /cgi_bin/ folders?\nIf this is not possible, in what other way should I do this?\n\nA: I found the answer to my question. I chowned the folders that I didn't want to be deleted to root:root, and then chmodded these folders using 'the sticky bit' (1775 instead of 0775). This way everybody can add files and folders over ftp as they please, but they could not remove the folders that I protected with the sticky bit since you'd have to be a file or folder owner to do that.\n\nA: You were on the right track. If you want to prevent actions like file creation and deletion (including deleting directories) then the user cannot have write access to the parent folder. In this case, to preserve /home/<user>/www/<domain>/public_html and /home/<user>/www/<domain>/cgi_bin, the user cannot have write access to /home/<user>/www/<domain>. To do that, the domain directories should be owned by somebody else and not world-writable.

I'm installing ubuntu onto a new laptop with 24gb SSD and a 500gb HDD. I wanted to put / and swap onto the SSD and /home onto the HDD. Is there anything I shouldn't use ext4 for?\nI do not ever intend to dual boot. Ubuntu only.\n\nA: Swap space doesn't use a filesystem at all. For regular filesystem partitions, my thoughts are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ext2fs -- This is the major surviving non-journaled Linux-native filesystem, and as such it has limited utility. I'd only recommend it on a small partition (such as a separate /boot partition or possibly a small USB flash drive), where the journal will be more of a detriment than an advantage.\n\n*Ext3fs -- This is ext2fs plus a journal, which reduces disk-check times after a power failure or system crash. Ext3fs used to be a decent choice, but it's been pretty well eclipsed by ext4fs these days....\n\n*Ext4fs -- This is ext3fs plus some new features that improve performance and enable use on larger disks. It's probably the best general-purpose filesystem for Linux these days; certainly it's the one that most distributions favor by default.\n\n*ReiserFS -- This filesystem is roughly comparable to ext3fs in features. Its main standout point is that it's especially good at handling small files (as in a few kilobytes, or even under a kilobyte). If you happen to be storing lots of dinky files, it's still worth considering. OTOH, it's not a \"hot\" filesystem, so development is slow, and ReiserFS lacks the advanced features found in ext4fs and the later filesystems on this list. A variant, Reiser4, promises such features but has been very slow in materializing as an actual in-kernel filesystem. I'm not holding my breath on Reiser4 becoming viable.\n\n*XFS -- Favored by system administrators on big disks (over a few terabytes), XFS has some moderately advanced features, and has a good reputation for handling large files. XFS partitions can't be shrunk, though, which can be a problem if you're not sure how big to make your partitions.\n\n*JFS -- Similar in many ways to XFS, JFS has never been as popular. A few years ago, it wasn't as reliable, but I'm not sure that's the case any more. I can't think of any good reasons to favor it today on a Linux-only system, although there may be some specialized cases where it would perform better than other filesystems.\n\n*Btrfs -- This is the newest Linux-native filesystem, and it includes advanced features like the ability to span a filesystem across multiple disks and to take snapshots. It's still experimental, though, so it's not really recommended for use in production environments.\n\n\nph0t0nix mentioned ZFS, but that's not really Linux-native. (It was developed by Sun, and has been ported to some of the BSDs, but licensing issues prevent moving that code into the Linux kernel.) There are two ZFS implementations for Linux, one of which can be built into the kernel and the other of which is a userspace driver accessed via FUSE. The kernel ZFS driver isn't part of the standard Linux kernel, though, which is a big drawback in my view; IMHO, a driver for your main filesystem should be a standard part of the kernel, not an add-on package that might not work if you upgrade your kernel.\nOverall, then, and IMHO, the best general-purpose options at the moment are ext4fs and XFS. Of the two, I give the nod to ext4fs because it's more popular and it can be shrunk. Ext2fs is OK on small partitions (say, under 1GB or so), ReiserFS can be good if you store lots of very small files, and Btrfs is good if you need advanced bleeding-edge features and don't mind the risk. I don't happen to have benchmark data handy on these filesystems, and such data can be difficult to interpret because so many factors can influence performance (disk type, file sizes, system load, etc.). You could try looking up such data if speed or system load is particularly important to you.\nThere are of course non-native filesystems, too -- NTFS, FAT, HFS+, etc. You can't use these as the filesystem for your main Linux installation. (I suppose you might be able to use HFS+ for that purpose, but I've never tried it, and it certainly isn't supported by the Ubuntu installer!) You'd use these for interoperability on dual-boot computers or on removable disks.\n\nA: For the setup you propose ext4 is recommended. \nIf you were to put /boot as a separate partition, you could use ext2 for that. For large filesystems (e.g. > 16TB I generally use xfs, as it I had some problems with ext4 there (problems when resizing the partition). And btrfs is still not recommended for production. For a server you could consider ZFS, which has been declared stable on Linux a few months ago. \n\nA: Use ext4 or XFS for your main partition. Use ext2 or non-journaled ext4 for boot.\nYou should use ext4 for your main partition. It provides high-performance, is quite stable, and is very resilient in the face of random corruption due to its use of a journal. You can also use XFS which is a very well-written, fast, and mature general-purpose filesystem. If you keep /boot on the same partition as your main installation, then you will naturally have to use only one filesystem.\nIf your boot directory is on a separate partition, then you would either want to use ext4 with the journal disabled, or ext2 which lacks a journal in the first place. It may be a good idea to forgo the journal simply because it is unnecessary when there is not going to be a lot of frequent filesystem changes that a journal can protect from corruption, and because it uses up valuable space.\nI would recommend ext4 with a disabled journal instead of ext2 simply because the former is faster and is more resistant to corruption, even without the journal, due to the excellent filesystem checker it comes with. You can format a device this way by running mkfs.ext4 -O ^has_journal /dev/sdx1.\nSome of the other general-purpose formats, described very briefly:\n\n\n*\n\n*ext2 - A simple and fast filesystem with no journal. Good for SD cards.\n\n*ext3 - Literally ext2 with a journal duct taped to it. Not a great filesystem.\n\n*ext4 - A modern and high-performance filesystem. You should use this.\n\n*XFS - Another modern and high-performance filesystem. Good for big partitions.\n\n*JFS - The first journaling filesystem. Not the fastest, but it's low on resources.\n\n*Btrfs - An \"advanced\" copy-on-write filesystem that is still pretty buggy.\n\n*ReiserFS - Good for many small files, but slow. Its primary developer is still in prison.\nThere are also a few \"specialized\" filesystems that are commonly supported:\n\n\n*\n\n*ZFS - Extremely powerful and amazingly reliable, but requires out-of-tree patches.\n\n*FAT - A very simple and widely-supported family of filesystems.\n\n*f2fs - Optimized for solid state drives to reduce wear-and-tear.\n\n*bcachefs - An upcoming very fast filesystem that makes use of an SSD cache.\nFor small SD cards or very small partitions, ext2, ext4 without a journal, and FAT are decent choices. For a primary installation, you can't go wrong with the popular ext4 or venerable XFS.\n", "Q: Is \"sudo apt-get update\" mandatory before every package installation? I know what the purpose of the update command is, and I was just wondering if i must use it before any package installation I perform. What if I have not update for too long and install some critical packages? Also, is there any occasion that there is no need to do that?\n\nA: You do not absolutly need to use the update command before you install a package, but if you don't you might end up upgrading a package just after you installed it.\nAlso, keep in mind that you need to update your system regularly. If you don't your computer will be at risk (you won't have the latest security patches).\n\nA: If you've only just added a software repository (PPA or Debian repository), you'll have to run apt-get update to poll the repository and essentially add any packages in it to APT's list of available software. Otherwise, APT won't recognize the name of the package you tell it to install.\nWhen installing new software via the command line, it is a good idea to update the repository information so you don't install software only to discover that it is outdated. This is true of upgrading software as well.\nIf you use the graphical method of installing or upgrading software, e.g. the Ubuntu Software Center or Update Manager, respectively, these clients will automatically check for the absolute latest versions of packages.\nThis being said, if you're installing a batch of software and have run an update just minutes or even a few hours before, chances are you'll get the latest version. However, if you're installing the type of software that is updated frequently (such as alpha/beta or bleeding-edge software), you'll want to run an update before fetching anything from that software's repository.\n\nA: Your copy of Ubuntu has a private copy of the list of packages that are in Ubuntu's repositories. When you install a package, apt-get reads the list and determines the URL of the package to download (which typically contains package version information).\napt-get update updates the package lists. If you don't do it before an installation, apt-get might complain that it cannot find the package in the repository, because it computed the URL based on an old version of the list (which listed an older version of the package).\nOf course, apt-get update is necessary after you have changed the repositories, because the system needs to download the list for the new repositories.\nIt is essential before upgrading the installed packages, because the system cannot know whether the repo has a new version of a package, unless it has an up-to-date copy of the package list.\nThere is no reason not to run apt-get update before installing a package. However, it is not necessary, if you know that no new version of that package and of its dependencies have been made available on the mirrors since the last apt-get update. A special case of this is when the package lists are up to date, which is after a reasonably short time since the last apt-get update; this means that all packages on the mirror are the same version as they were.\nThe package list changes whenever a package is upgraded on the mirror. It is impossible to predict how often it changes, in general, without reference to a specific issue or bug report, or without following the development of that Ubuntu release.\n", "Q: cron.daily jobs not running I created 3 daily cron jobs to run.\nBelow are the three that are placed in etc/cron.daily\nrkhunter.sh\n#!/bin/sh\n(\nrkhunter --versioncheck\nrkhunter --update\nrkhunter --cronjob --report-warnings-only\n) | mail -s 'rkhunter Daily Run (my server)' me@email.com\n\nchkrootkit.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nchkrootkit | mail -s \"chkrootkit Daily Run (my server)\" me@email.com\n\nlogwatch.sh\n#!/bin/sh\n(\nlogwatch\n) | mail -s 'logwatch Daily Log (my server)' me@email.com\n\nI replaced me@email.com ofcourse with my email.\nIf I run this cronjob manually it works fine ./nameoffile.sh\nBut it doesn't run daily, what can be the cause or how can I check into this?\n\nA: According to this response, the problem lies with the .sh extension. Remove that (so for example rename your file from rkhunter.sh to rkhunter.\nTo confirm run the following command run-parts --test /etc/cron.daily\nIf your script (rkhunter) is included in the results, all is good. For more information on the run-parts command, read the man pages on it man run-parts\n\nA: Adding to Stef answer, you also should make sure that they have the executable bit:\n$ ls -l\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   268 Jun  1 08:06 00logwatch\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   311 May 22  2012 0anacron\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 15007 Jun  6 14:08 apt\n\nYou should be able to run them using chmod +x filename.\n\nA: There are two possible suspects that usually cause cron jobs not being able to run.\nThe first is permissions problems, that is a user can run the script/command but the cron daemon cannot because the job is in the wrong user's cron jobs. For example the user creates a script or runs a command with elevated privileges i.e using sudo, then adds the tested script/command to his list of cron jobs (crontab). The result is that the user's cron job will not be able to run since it needs elevated privileges. \n\n\n*\n\n*To put a cron job in current user's crontab type crontab -e\n\n*To put a cron job in root's crontab type sudo crontab -e\nThe second reason is the paths, in order to be sure that the script will execute, the user must add the full path to the script to be executed in crontab. Another solution would be to expand the root users PATH variable by putting the following line at the top of their crontab file:\nPATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n\nas the community wiki mentions.\nYou may want to read the community wiki  about cron as it provides further details about the above.\n\nA: Rename your file to not have the .sh extension   \nTo verify this is the issue, try \nsudo run-parts --list /etc/cron.daily \n\nyou will see it's not listed.  So run:\nmv script.sh script\n\nand try listing again.  It should be listed.\n\nA: In my system it was because anacron wasn't installed.\ngrep run-parts /etc/crontab\n\n17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\n52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )\n\nSo either install anacron or remove the test -x /usr/sbin/anacron\n\nA: I think files with extensions are ignored.\nrun:  run-parts --test /etc/cron.daily\nIf you don't see your scripts listed, remove the .sh extensions and try again.\n\nA: The default time to execute daily scripts is 06:25 AM. If your machine is off at this time (every day), they don't run.\nanacron runs scripts that were missed because the machine was off.\nYou can configure a different time by editing /etc/crontab.\n\nA: I could not get it run with anacron, I removed anacron from /etc/crontab and executed apt remove --purge anacron and it works right away.\nI do not understand why we need two scheduler.\n\nA: Same situation today here\nI did\nsudo journalctl -u cron -b | grep -i error\n\nand found\ncron[815]: Error: bad hour; while reading /etc/crontab\ncron[815]: (*system*) ERROR (Syntax error, this crontab file will be ignored)\n\nI discovered that someone (me !!!!) added a line starting with\n20 38 ...\n\nand obviously the 38th hour doesn't exist !\n\nA: Similar issue solved in these steps\n\n*\n\n*Restart cron service to see what happened in logs. service cron restart\n\n\n*Monitor logs grep -i cron /var/log/syslog show\n\ncron[37426]: (**) ERROR (Missing newline before EOF, this crontab file will be ignored)\ncron[37426]: (CRON) INFO (Skipping @reboot jobs -- not system startup)\n\nLogs show the misbehavior relates to my cron EOF.\nAfter cat it, cat /etc/cron.d/mycron prove that this file doesn't have newline at last line.\n\n\n*Solution is to append newline to last line.\n\necho >> /etc/cron.d/mycron\n\nIf open the file with Vim, then save (:wq) its also append newline to last line of file.\nforce vim not append newline at end of file\n", "Q: Why does my upgrade says it needs more space than what a clean installation needs? I have Ubuntu installed on my laptop with the following disk organization:\n\n\n*\n\n*20 GB for /\n\n*5 GB for /home\n\n\nThe large root I have was intended in principle for installing large pieces of scientific software, but in fact I don't have any of that software installed currently.\nI have checked my disk space for installing ubuntu 12.04 and I have found that it takes ~15 GB. I have checked on the web that a typical installation should be ~4-6 GB.\nHow can it be? I don't have big pieces of software, I have also removed the Office Suite to have more space. I keep all my data somewhere else. My installation is pretty minimal. I have already removed all the old kernel and header files, cleaned with apt-get autoremove and removed any unused piece of software with Computer Janitor.\nIn fact I found 4.5GB of scientific software I had forgotten about, nonetheless the installation would be 10.5 GB without those pieces of software, that seems still a lot to me. I also have the full tetex-latex installed. \nThe upgrade to 12.04 require 5GB of space, and I had to remove 3.5GB of that optional software I had.\nNow I have the following:\nFilesystem                Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda8                  20G   15G  4.3G  78% /\nudev                      993M  4.0K  993M   1% /dev\ntmpfs                     401M  860K  400M   1% /run\nnone                      5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone                     1003M  7.0M  996M   1% /run/shm\n/dev/sda6                 5.0G  4.1G  612M  88% /home\n\nthat 15GB still look like a lot, it is 3.5GB more than v10.04\n\noutput of sudo du -hs --exclude=/proc /* \n8.6M    /bin\n32M     /boot\n0       /cdrom\n460K    /core\n4.0K    /dev\n20M     /etc\n0       /gl_driver.so\n0       /initrd.img\n176M    /lib\n4.4M    /lib64\n16K     /lost+found\n32K     /media\n458M    /opt\n116K    /path\n19M     /root\n1.1M    /run\n9.3M    /sbin\n4.4G    /scratch\n4.0K    /selinux\n200K    /srv\n0       /sys\n104K    /tmp\n6.6G    /usr\n520M    /var\n0       /vmlinuz\n\n\nA: This is because the installer needs to download the updates packages first, which pretty much sums 3 times what you are using right now. Example:\nYou have 3 GB of programs installed, the packages to upgrade all that weights about 1.7 GB, now all those packages need to be uncompressed when installing, so you will be using 3 GB or more extra. The grand total 7.7 GB of data to do a full upgrade. That's why you need the extra space when upgrading from a release to another. In your case, since you have already /home in another partition, just install Ubuntu 12.04 on top of the root filesystem. Tell the installer that you want to use the old /home without formating, and you should be in 12.04 pretty quick.\n", "Q: Troubleshooting Proprietary NVIDIA 319.49 Driver Though I would prefer to use the open-source nouveau drivers, the support for my 485M chip has not proved fruitful in the past.\nBecause NVIDIA's driver repository is somewhat dated, I downloaded the latest (recommended, NOT beta) driver install package/script from the official site. I then booted into recovery and ran the installer with no hiccups save for one warning regarding the failure to run a \"distribution-provided pre-install script.\" The install completed successfully with no warnings or errors, and I was sure to build the kernel module and even ran update-initramfs -u to ensure a proper boot. However, after selecting Ubuntu from GRUB, all that is presented is a blank screen with a blinking underscore cursor in the top left corner.\nAfter searching around a bit, I've learned that others experiencing problems with the proprietary drivers in Ubuntu (and Mint) are often presented with TTY error screens during boot displaying some level of verbosity concerning displays, or experience a full graphical boot plagued by blinking/flashing images. I also learned that some problems may be present with the proprietary driver on notebook systems.\nHas anyone had a similar experience with this or previous version of the NVIDIA proprietary driver on Ubuntu/Debian-based [or otherwise] Linux systems? Does anything come to mind that might resolve the issue?\nI am running a 64-bit system under Ubuntu 13.04 with an Intel Core i7-2920XM chipset and a NVIDIA GTX 485M graphics card.\n\nA: This was a very strange problem that seemingly resolved itself. Or rather, something I did resolved it. Possible factors that may have contributed to its resolution are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The reinstallation of the nvidia-common package\n\n*The reinstallation of the entire driver (though I did this multiple times)\n\n*The running of nvidia-xconfig, nvidia-modprobe, and nvidia-persistence\n\n*Running the tested proprietary driver listed in the Additional Drivers tab of the Software Properties application before the final reinstallation of the current driver.\n\n", "Q: E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2) When trying to run sudo apt-get upgrade my computer returns an error that I am not sure how to fix.

They are in the Thunar's source code.\nIn order to remove the \"Delete\" default action you should download the source code, edit, and then recompile it.\nNOTE: In my case I'm running Xubuntu 13.04 with Thunar 1.6.2\n\nYou can try the following:\n1) Open a Terminal and install the necessary packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install build-essential\n2) Install build dependencies\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get build-dep thunar\n3) Create a folder to download the source code.\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir ~/Downloads/src\n\n*cd ~/Downloads/src\n4) Download the source code.\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get source thunar\n5) Edit the the file \"thunar-standard-view.c\"\n\n\n*\n\n*mousepad thunar-1.6.2/thunar/thunar-standard-view.c\nYou should remove the line number \"402\" and save the changes.\n\n{ \"delete\", GTK_STOCK_DELETE, N_ (\"_Delete\"), NULL, NULL, G_CALLBACK\n  (thunar_standard_view_action_delete), },\n\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\n6) Go to the \"thunar-1.6.2\" folder to build the deb packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd thunar-1.6.2/\n\n*dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b\n7) Now you can install the deb packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ..\n\n*sudo dpkg -i *deb\n8) Finally you can logout and Login to see the changes.\n9) Your thunar file manager should look like this: (without the \"Delete\" Action\")\n\nhope it helps.\n\nA: Actually, you can remove the Delete context menu from settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*click Edit\n\n*choose Preferences\n\n*in tab Behavior, under Context Menu, check Show action to permanently  delete files and folders\nBut Roman Raguet's solution above works well.

It doesn't. \nWith files, yes, there is a More dropdown, it gives options to delete or download the file. But with folders, there is no dropdown. All that happens when I click \"more\" next to a folder is that a blank line appears under the folder, and if I click \"more\" again the blank line disappears. \nI assume that's a bug ...?

Most probably /dev/sdb is the usb one(if no other usb storage is plugged-in).You should see something like this(if it is a 8 GB pendrive)\nDisk /dev/sdb: 8.0 GB,blabla.....\nNow to make a bootable usb\nsudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nBE CAREFUL with of option. If you carelessly put something wrong you will be doomed. \nIf you have windows installed, you can use LiLi\n", "Q: gksu -w doesn't work the way I am used to? I have used gksu -w shutdown -hP now as a system-wide menu command in icewm, so that when a non-admin user clicked the shutdown from the menu, a password dialogue box will appear asking for the admin password.  That was when I was running icewm in Linux Mint.  \nWhen I switched to Ubuntu, the same command wouldn't work. Although the same dialogue box asking for admin password appears, but none of the existing sudoers password I tried would work or accepted.  Even the password of the first account I was asked to make on installation of Ubuntu wouldn't work.\nI have also tried gksu -u admin-user  -w 'shutdown -hP now, but the error message \"shutdown: Need to be root\" came up.\nSo what is the difference between Ubuntu's and Mint's gksu rules? I'm currently using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and the Mint I'm referring to is Mint 13 Maya. And what could be other alternative ways to allow a Shutdown command in the IceWM menu for non-admin users, but I still want them to ask permission first from me before they could shutdown, by asking for my admin password? \nBesides shutdown, I also have other commands in the IceWM menu that require admin privileges, like hibernate, to mount a backup partition, and synaptic, which I applied gksu -w with.\n\nA: The problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*gksu -w will ask for your root password, however the root user does not have a password by default in Ubuntu, so everything you try will fail.\n\n*gksu -u admin-user -w will execute shutdown as admin-user, but you need to be root, not admin-user.\nThe possible solutions are two:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use gksu -u admin-user -w gksu -S. Which means: first switch to admin-user (gksu -u admin-user -w), then become root (gksu -S).\n\n*Set a password for the root user. This way, gksu -w will work as you expect.\nThe drawback for the first solution is that you will be asked for two passwords, which may be uncomfortable. The drawback for the second solution is that enabling the root user is not recommended.\n\nA: I would reccommend using gksudo and not gksu although they aren't very different in Ubuntu. Just add the 'admin-username' to the 'sudoers' or 'admin' group or just give it access to the shutdown command in the /etc/sudoers file. \nThen instead of gksu -w <admin-username> <command> you could use gksudo <command>.\nAgain the whole point of having sudo/gksudo is to have users be able to do administrative tasks without giving them full blown root access.\n", "Q: Exclude directory from Unity Search I am re-asking this question:\nHow to remove a specific folder from the Ubuntu search?\nbecause I do not believe it was a duplicate, or was answered in that post.\nThis has nothing to do with Zeitgeist OR recent files. (I already have zeitgeist and file history monitoring disabled.)\nI would like to know if it is possible to prevent Unity Search from displaying the contents of a specific directory in its search results - ie: not to include that directory when searching. The same way you can tell it not to include online search results.\nThanks\n/H\n\nA: Actually I think this is a built-in feature.  It's a common thing to need to exclude directories from your search.  Here's how to configure it:\nOpen the system settings\n     Select \"Security & Privacy\"\n          Go to the tab named \"Files & Applications\"\nYou should see a box named \"Exclude\", use the \"+\" and \"-\" buttons to update this.  Anything NOT excluded will be used in the search.\nNote that you will also need to \"Clear Usage Data\" from the \"Files & Applications\" dialog in order to remove previously browsed files and folders from the Dash Search. By default Dash Search will include your historical file usage even if you have explicitly excluded these files.\n\nA: You can make a directory/file hidden. I. believe that unity does not search into hidden files and folders.\nTo hide a file, add a dot. before it. I.e to hide a folder named documents, right click it, click on rename, and rename it as .documents\n\nA: this is not much easy I think. I will tell you what I know that you can hide all files from the unity search by removing its files lenses with the command as \nsudo apt-get remove unity-lens-files\n\nThat will hide all the files from unity search.\n\n\n*\n\n*one more thing that can help you is create a new user and put the directory which you would like to hide in his home directory. so Unity can not search in his area.\n(or)\n\n*change the folder/file attributes to root user only , so that unity can not list you that item in search.\nhope that helps,:)\n", "Q: Automatically switch keyboard to match language of surrounding text Is there a functionality in some Windows Writing applications that changes keyboard layout. like this:\nhttp://office.microsoft.com/en-001/word-help/turn-on-automatic-language-options-HA010354274.aspx#_Toc311028922\nIs there a simiar functionlity in Ubuntu or any ubuntu sotfware. I'm looking for any add-on or an option that activates such a functionality in LibreOffice.\nSomeone said linux softwares cannot change keyboard layout because a linux OS is kind of autocratic about system options and keyboard layout. But I think it is possible because plasma desktop does it.\n\nA: Ubuntu is an operating system, it manages your software, your files, your internet connection. An operating system doesn't have a particular natural language associated, it rather has an interface that can be rendered with multiple languages. Ubuntu is perfectly able to manage multiple keyboard layouts, but the concept of \"surround text\" does not apply to an operating system or its interface.\nThe request you make only makes sense within a particular text editing program such as gedit.

It seems to me learning how to use the terminal is a prerequisite to learning how to use Ubuntu. So I'm trying to figure out the best way to learn. Is there a Quizlet online flash card set out there? A better way?\n\nA: You've got tons of games on http://overthewire.org. The easiest is Bandit, \"aimed for absolute beginners\".\n\nA: There is a game for learning the VIM commands at http://vim-adventures.com/ which I recommend.  I get my apprentices to play it on their first day :-)\n\nA: I used to play with whatis. It's not exactly a game, but it's a relatively easy way to learn. \nFor example, type whatis sudo apt-get update  and it returns:\n\nBefore I execute any command, I hit it with whatis first. I learn what I'm going to do, then I will do the command with confidence. \nIf whatis doesn't provide much information or if it's unclear to me, I will go to and read the man.\nFor example, man sudo. \nGoogle gives you so much info here, sources inside Ask Ubuntu and outside. Here, LMGTFY: best way to learn terminal commands on Ubuntu\n\nA: Yes, Terminus is once such game that will help. There is a live version here, and the code is on github. It's a neat idea, although I rather wish the code was more easily  extensible. \n\nA: I do not know of any games, however there are some useful command line utilities that help.\nWhat does a command do?\nwhatis command\n# example:\n$ whatis cut\ncut (1)              - remove sections from each line of files\n\nHow do I?\nman -k keyword\n# example:\n$ man -k \"remove empty\"\nrmdir (1)            - remove empty directories\n\nAlternatively:\napropos keyword  \n# defaults to printing every result with at least one of the keywords supplied\n#   use --and to only print results matching multiple keywords.\n$ apropos zip --and extract\nfunzip (1)           - filter for extracting from a ZIP archive in a pipe\nunzip (1)            - list, test and extract compressed files in a ZIP archive\nunzipsfx (1)         - self-extracting stub for prepending to ZIP archives\nuz (1)               - gunzips and extracts a gzip'd tar'd archive\n\nHow do I use?\nman command\n# example:\nman tar\n# use '?' key to search, and 'q' to quit.\n\nOr, some utilities support a help option, such as:\n$ umount --help\nUsage: umount -h | -V\n   umount -a [-d] [-f] [-r] [-n] [-v] [-t vfstypes] [-O opts]\n   umount [-d] [-f] [-r] [-n] [-v] special | node...\n\nThese may be in the form of command -h, command --help, command -?.\nFor information:\ninfo command\n# example:\n$ info cat\n# shows an information page\n\nIf you have something specific you need to accomplish, Google is your friend. Otherwise there are many books, such as the Bash book from O'Rielly. \n\nA: The Memrise Tool has a unix and linux command line section. It's a great tool for learning anything in a punch card manner.\n\nA: Take a look at \ncommand line fu\nYou can browse some cool command line snippets, and if you want deeper understanding you can read the manuals of the commands they use.\n\nA: You can add the following line (command) at the end of your ~/.bashrc file:\necho \"Did you know that:\"; whatis $(ls /bin | shuf -n 1)\n\nEvery time you open the terminal you will learn something about a random command.\n\nIf you want some fun, you can use cowsay \"utility\". To install it, run this in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install cowsay\n\nThen add the following line at the end of your ~/.bashrc file:\ncowsay -f $(ls /usr/share/cowsay/cows | shuf -n 1 | cut -d. -f1) $(whatis $(ls /bin) 2>/dev/null | shuf -n 1)\n\nOr you can add the above line as alias in ~/.bash_aliases. I added:\nalias ?='cowsay -f $(ls /usr/share/cowsay/cows | shuf -n 1 | cut -d. -f1) $(whatis $(ls /bin) 2>/dev/null | shuf -n 1)'\n\nWhenever you get bored, you can type in terminal: ? (followed by Enter). It's like playing dice by yourself.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu was designed to be very user friendly. Learning how to use the terminal is not a prerequisite to learning how to use Ubuntu. \nIt is, however, if you want to become a power user or troubleshoot problems yourself.\nTo answer your question, I don't know of any games designed to help or teach shell commands, but I would highly recommend the following resources bash and system administration related:\n\n\n*\n\n*UNIX Tutorial for Beginners\nPlease note that this tutorial uses Red Hat (another Linux distribution) and references some directories that only apply to students of the University of Surrey.\n\n\n*\n\n*BASH Programming - Introduction HOW-TO\nHosted at The Linux Documentation Project (http://www.tldp.org/), author Mike G\n\n\n*\n\n*Bash Shell Scripting\nA wikibook from Wikipedia\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.nongnu.org/lpi-manuals/manual/\nStudy manuals fro the Linux Professional Institute (LPI)\n\n*http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html\nGNU Bash Reference Manual\n\n\n*\n\n*http://linux.die.net/abs-guide/\nAdvanced Bash-Scripting Guide (http://linux.die.net/), author Mendel Cooper\n\nA: The Linux Documentation Project is having the best and updating sources for learning BASH. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/\n\n*http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/\n\n*http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html\nUbuntu Community have collected all the good links which are very much helpful to learn BASH \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommandLineResources\n\nA: There is the game Uplink. It's been quite fun and threre are pretty good similarities to a linux shell. But it's got its own commands as well.\n\nA: The best tool I have found for long term memorization and learning is Anki\nhttp://www.ankisrs.net/\nI use create cards in Anki that require me to type the answer, rather than simply a flash card.  It builds the muscle memory.  Additionally I perform 15 minutes of training every morning and Anki will sort my cards based on the ones I need to review.\n\nA: In the early UNIX days (v6 and v7)  (yes before Linux), there was a series of very simplistic tutorials under the command called learn.  I must admit, I started my training there .. it had tutorials on command line, vi, and a little bit of C programming.  It has long since disappeared.  And of course, this was before the proliferation of books on this subject, the high amount of easy internet connectivity, basically all you had was basically the man pages. \nSo now it is quite easy, basically go to Google, either find some documentation posted. Or use amazon to find an appropriate book.  Amazon even has ratings and reviews on their books.\n\nA: Well, most of the basics I learned when Linux was still mostly command-line based and SUSE was one of the few Linux with GUI-based installation. I played around with Gentoo these times...just install your system with some tools like pm-sensors and stuff, soon you're back in the terminal for some configuration\nI don't know if there is still a distro that is installed via command-line, as I stopped working with Linux till a month ago, when I found out they finally made the step to getting GUI-based and interesting for Users, great thanks to all programmers out there, that made a lot of my old PCs useful again!!!\nStupid MS simply IS too stupid for maintaining their best product any longer...Windows XP...a company that does that, surely is not considering to get an OS fully stable and safe...and in case of Win 7 they may got it very stable and secure, but it takes way to much resources to do so.\nReally love the Linux way off controlling hardware without huge compilers or interpreters or other stuff in the way, like on Windows.\nBut if you want learn more about Linux, Gentoo is a great way of building up your own system, step by step and also learn how Linux works.\nGentoo also is able to run on nearly everything, no matter how small the hardware resources, so you can take a other, older PC for these Linux, install-test, fun times!\n\nA: Not exactly a game, but there is this site, where you can learn several different commands.  \n\nA: Not a game but take a look at http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs124/kwc-unix-for-poets.pdf\nIt covers sed, awk and grep besides others and shows you how to count, sort, compute ngrams etc. It has exercises and all. I've referred to it again and again. \n\nA: Not a game, but comes handy when you want to learn some command and no linux is available: rextester\n\nA: The matrix for game cube is where I learned quite(relative to my 13 year old prior knowledge) a bit about the UNIX terminal.  There was a mini-game where you'd \"hack\" your way into the matrix to drop guns off for pickup later when you are playing that level.  Actually bar far one of my favorite features of any game ever.\n\nA: inx (is not X) can be used as live cd and teaches terminal stuff in a fun and interactive way\n\nA: I guess bandit  is one of the best to learn and understand more about Linux commands and knowing more about linux for beginners.\nYou can get the link from here\n", "Q: Boot from a partition (Windows 8) I'm currently running Windows 8 on an HP Pavilion g7 laptop and I tried installing Ubuntu 13.04 from my flash drive just recently.\nInstallation went as normal and I created a 50 GB partition for it.  At the end it said I needed to reboot so I pressed OK. A few seconds later an error message popped up and said there was an error and I needed to reboot (or I could stay at the desktop and debug or something). I clicked stay at desktop but it kicked me out into a command line and I really couldn't do anything there so I just held the power button and shut it off. Now I have the partition made (it shows up in Windows as the G: drive), I just have no way to access it without booting from live disk/usb.\nIs there some way I can pick which partition to boot from when I power my laptop on?\nEdit: Don't know if it helps much but I remember my caps lock key flashing when I was stuck at the command line thing.  (Maybe someone will know what I was at from this?)\nEdit: i have a 500 GB disk, and I created the partition in the Ubuntu setup itself.  I'm a little busy but I'll try a few of the suggestions in a little while and see how it goes\n\nA: Although your symptom is the opposite of what's described, my answer to the following question may work for you:\nHow do I boot to Windows 8 from Ubuntu 13.04 on a dual-boot EFI install? (No Grub)\nAlso, a minor side note: You probably don't want Ubuntu's partition to show up as your G: drive in Windows. To fix this, you can launch gdisk and change the type code of your Linux partition from 0700 to 8300. See this page for more on this topic.\n\nA: I'm not very sure if this would help you, but I find your problem somehow similar to mine. I was able to dual boot windows and ubuntu by using boot-repair via liveCD (ubuntu's installer)\nInsert your LiveCD, and choose Try ubuntu without installing. Then open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type this line by line, or just paste it in the terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\nWhen boot-repair shows up. Just click recommended repair. It'll take a while. By the way, be sure that you're connected to the internet because it'll be downloading stuffs. I'm pretty sure you're to question whether it's working or not because there's no progress bar to know whether it's working well, so open system monitor. Just press the windows key and type it. Now, go to resources tab. You'll see on the network history whether boot-repair is working and downloading. When it's all good. Just follow boot-repairs instructions.\nHope I was of any help\n\nA: I figured it out.\nWhen I boot up my laptop, i just have to press escape, which brings up a menu.  From there I press f9 and it lets me pick what to boot from.  Maybe this works because I ran boot repair from a live CD.  I'm not exactly sure but this works for me\n", "Q: How to start the dictionary application after installation? I installed a dictionary application using this site: - http://www.noobslab.com/2011/07/install-offline-ubuntu-dictionary.html but after installation when I searched for it on / , I didn't see any application file that was to be launched (like I do for other applications). Could anyone help me open this application please? If not, is there any good dictionary app that I can install instead? \n\nA: \nIs there any good dictionary app that I can install instead?\n\nI would recommend the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Artha\nsudo apt-get install artha\n\n\n\n*\n\n*GoldenDict\nsudo apt-get install goldendict\nInstall the copyright free GNU powered English dictionary\nsudo apt-get install dict-gcide\n\n\nA: You've followed a specific tutorial. How about the follow up tutorial? ;)\n", "Q: Back up SSHFS network drive to Crashplan? I often develop and test code on several remote machines, which aren't all on the same NFS filesystem. For interactive work, I usually use SSHFS to mount remote filesystems on my local machine. For example:\nmkdir ~/machine1\nsshfs me@machine1.domain.org: ~/machine1 #mount machine1's home directory locally\n\nI've been using CrashPlan for the last couple of years to back up my local hard disks. I'd like to start using CrashPlan to backup remote disks that are mounted locally. \nIn the CrashPlan UI, it gives me the option to back up ~/machine1. However, CrashPlan thinks that the ~/machine1 directory is empty, even when machine1.domain.org is mounted there. \nHow can I get CrashPlan to \"see\" drives that I've mounted using SSHFS?\n\nA few closing thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I expect that backing up an SSHFS-mounted drive will be pretty slow. I'm not too worried about the speed; I just have small bits and pieces of data on each of these remote drives.\n\n*I could probably install CrashPlan on all the remote machines. But, this would be my last resort: CrashPlan doesn't have a command-line interface that I know of, so managing CrashPlan on a headless machine isn't very fun.\n\n\nA: The reason why it isn't working is that no other user than your user can see sshfs mounted directories. Unless Crashplan is running as your user it won't be able to back it up. You can try it for yourself:\nsudo -i\nls -al ~me/ | grep machine1\nls: cannot access /home/me/machine1: Permission denied\n??????????   ? ?       ?              ?              ? machine1\n\nThere is a way to do mount sshfs to make files available for root too or everyone on the machine. If Crashplan is running as root you should only make it available for root.\nsshfs -o allow_root me@machine1.domain.org: ~/machine1 \n\nOr you can allow anyone (including root) on the machine to see your files with:\nsshfs -o allow_other me@machine1.domain.org: ~/machine1 \n\nYou may need to allow for these flags in /etc/fuse.conf:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fuse.conf\n\nChange the line:\n#user_allow_other\n\nto \nuser_allow_other\n\nYou also need to be in the fuse group. run groups and if you are not fuse is listed you need to run:\nsudo addgroup <your user> fuse\n\nThen logout and in again and it should work.\n\nA: Actually, running CrashPlan on a headless machine is kinda fun.\nSee http://support.crashplan.com/doku.php/how_to/configure_a_headless_client\nYou might prefer this because you'll get more granularity on setting up how the backups run.\n", "Q: Boot problem in Ubuntu Yesterday night I directly shutdown my computer by pressing the shutdown key from the keyboard.

Everytime a song is played on Rhythmbox from my playlist a pop-up on the upper-right side of the screen shows. How could I hide it?\n\nA: The infamous popup you are referring to is the Ubuntu notification system.\nYou'll see that with a variety of applications - weather apps, empathy as well as plugging in external devices.\nHowever if you specifically dont like rhythmbox displaying a notification about which song is playing, it is simple enough to disable it.\nFrom the rhythmbox global menu choose Edit-Plugins or Tools > Plugins, scroll down and deselect Notification\n\nN.B. The global menu can be revealed by hovering your mouse at the top of the screen over the top of the panel which is called the menubar.\n\nA: Just to add to @fossfreedomg's comment: This is how I did it in Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty)\ngsettings set org.gnome.rhythmbox.plugins active-plugins \"['artsearch', 'audiocd', 'audioscrobbler', 'cd-recorder', 'daap', 'dbus-media-server', 'generic-player', 'ipod', 'iradio', 'mmkeys', 'mpris', 'mtpdevice', 'power-manager']\"\n\nYou can list your current settings via:\ngsettings list-recursively org.gnome.rhythmbox.plugins\n\n\nA: Just had this problem myself and glad to find an answer.\nOn Ubuntu 20.04 I searched for Notifications and got the following...\n\nWhen you click the RhythmBox choice you'll see a poup that lets you control things more specifically:\n\nI turned off the Notification Popups and it solved the problem.\n\nThe note just means that if you look in the notifications area you will still see a notification of the current song that is playing.  However, it won't popup on the screen any longer.\n", "Q: My laptop is becoming slower at times, how can I figure out if it is a hardware or a software issue? Over the last month my 15 month old laptop has started showing me 100 % CPU utilization.\nI used to have ubuntu 12.10 on it. I did a clean install of Ubuntu 13.04 on it and it was fine for a while.\nI run pycharm, a couple of django servers, mongodb, mysql, chrome, firefox, a music player etc. My computer usage has not changed over the last year. I have run 12.04 and 12.10 very comfortably before this.\nMy previous laptop got screwed over 3 years and I am suspecting the same is happening here as well, but I can not see anything, like the laptop overheating etc.\nI have a thinkpad 420i with i3 processor and 8 gigs of RAM\nIt shows CPU utilization for about 10 minutes after startup. I have to confess that I start all my programs with a single bash script.\nAfter that the system usually behaves well but sometimes it starts to annoy me again.\nThe question is that I want to investigate and figure out if it is software issue or hardware issue. If it is hardware, I want to get stuff fixed before everything goes South. How do I do it?\n\nA: You can use htop what's going on your system. \nhtop displays all the running process in the system ordered by certain columns. This displays the information real-time CPU Usage, Memory Usage and Swap Usage\n\nman htop will give all usage detail. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Development on 2nd Gen Nexus 7? I was reading the steps over at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation but I don't see the 2nd gen Nexus 7 ever mentioned.  It's also not in the FAQ, and before I follow through with it I just wanted to make sure this is supported on the 2nd gen Nexus as well.  I see no reason it shouldn't work, just wanted to make sure before I give it a go.\n\nA: It won't work. The hardware is completely different and you will likely end up with a soft-bricked device. The CPUs are different (grouper/tilapia has Tegra 3, razor has Snapdragon 600), and so are the kernels.\n", "Q: \"PHP Startup: odbtp: Unable to initialize module\" module API doesn't match I need to enable a module installed on my system.

A simple:\nsudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-0\n\nShould do the work.\n\nA: What solved the problem was this:\nI just changed the package-name from libjack-jackd2-0 to libjack-jackd2-0.old, then I did the\n  sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-0 libjack-jackd2-0:i386\n\nIt work for me, was because of this(This was the hint) which made me try following what he did:\n'./usr/share/doc/libjack-jackd2-0/buildinfo.gz' is different from the same file on the system\n\nwhat I did was I looked at the /usr/shar/doc/ to look for the libjack-jackd2-0 folder found it and appended in its name \".old\" so that it won't find it again when doing the \n  sudo apt-get -f install libjack-jackd2-0 libjack-jackd2-0:i386\n\nafter changing the name, I tried doing the apt-get -f install  it worked and it went smoothly as it should be and now everything's fine, I can install now using sudo apt-get without errors. I don't have to worry for later consequences because after that completed upgrade I removed the software or application that was using those packages via apt-get remove which was lmms(Linux MultiMedia Studio) and did some sudo apt-get autoremove if in-case there were packages left useless and never did I try re-installing it again.\nJust got lucky I think. but I definitely don't recommend on doing this on every package dependency error because not all show the same errors;\nDefinitely reading and analyzing the error helped a lot. because some answered disabling the package on the package tree, some say remove the package and install again but got lucky that it was just a build file error.\nI hope this helps.. \n", "Q: System settings is missing System settings is missing. I tried reinstall it as it mentioned here, but it seems to be installed and deactivated. This problem occurred when I installed Elementary desktop environment and uninstalled it afterwards. \n\nA: In case you install Gnome 3.12 on Ubuntu 14.04 via the gnome3-staging ppa you need to:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-settings-daemon-schemas \n\nThis will install the settings daemon correctly. There seems to be an issue with dependencies and correct upgrade paths.\n\nA: You can try to reinstall gnome-control-center from terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-control-center\n\n\nA: After you do this, log out and back in, then go to (search your computer and online sources) top left type in (system settings) then drag the icon to your launch bar. That will put it back in the left launch bar also\n\nA: I know this is already late but it can still help someone.\nThis can happen when a library required to run gnome control center is missing, you can fix this by reinstalling or updating gnome.\nI was able to fix this on Debian 10 (buster) running GNOME desktop environment.

Originally I had 2 monitors on each card and tried to set it up that way, but I kept getting the White Screen of Death and could not resolve the problem.\nI then decided to put all 4 monitors on a single card (1 HDMI, 2 DVI, 1 Mini Display Port) and Crossfire with the second card.\nUpon a fresh install, the open source drivers worked and all four monitors worked correctly.  The problem is that the open source drivers caused Unity to run excruciatingly slow, making it very difficult to work with.  When I say slow, I mean the cursor was slow, windows would take several seconds to slowly fade in, responsiveness was slow, etc....\nI decided to check out the proprietary drivers, because I had read that the open source drivers don't really handle 3D Acceleration correctly.  I installed the AMD 13.04 drivers from the website, and got 2 monitors to appear, but I cannot get the other two to activate.\nJust to be clear, all four monitors are recognized by the drivers, but when I try to activate them in catalyst (using sudo amdcccle) the changes are ignored and only 2 monitors are used.  When I try xinerama all 4 screens will 'turn on' and be recognized, but Unity turns black and no windows appear (the only thing I can see is the cursor).\nWhen I try to use RandR it complains about requested size and then a maximum/minimum virtual size (something similar to the following:\n\nThe selected configuration for displays could not be applied required virtual size does not >fit available size: requested=(2646, 1024), minimum=(320, 200), maximum=(1366,1366).  \n\nAs a result I've tried going into xorg.conf and adjusting the virtual size as recommended here: Multi screen problems \"virtual size does not fit available size\".  I've also tried the amdcccle solution provided in that article.\nIf I try to activate the other 2 windows and arrange them in RandR it says it's unable to make the requested change (I believe a error with CTRC 148).\nAt this point I'm not sure what to try to make all my monitors work with Ubuntu while allowing 3D Acceleration for reasonable performance.  How can I fix this, Is it possible?  Is this issue with all GNOME desktops, or just Unity?  I've been debating switching to Kubuntu just because this problem is kind of debilitating and I hear KDE runs better with multiple monitors, but I'd really prefer to stay in Unity if possible.\nNote: I will try to post my xorg.conf once I log into Ubuntu, I'm writing this from my Windows bootup\n\nA: the new beta 13.8 drivers from AMD actually took care of the issue for me, and supported all monitors out of the box.  Just make sure when you access amdcccle that you use gksu instead of sudo.  thus far everything has been working great now.\n", "Q: Two keyboards two language layouts I want to connect two keyboard sets to my computer. Is it possible to set each for a specific language. So that there's no need to change language each time.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*keyboard 1 types russian\n\n*keyboard 2 types english\n\nA: Slightly off-topic, but if you additionally use the -variant option, you can type dvorak on one keyboard and workman or qwerty or any other layout on the other keyboard.\nsetxkbmap -verbose -device 17 -layout us -variant dvorak\n\nPair programming on steroids!\n\nA: Using xinput and setxkbmap utilities, you can set from terminal so that each keyboard to have a different layout.\nFirst, using xinput -list | grep key command, you have to find the device ID of each keyboard.

I have one new desktop (server with 8 core CPU, 8Gb of RAM and HD7770 GPU) and two clients (old desktop and old laptop) connected using gigabit network. I want to make server act like some terminal server for client PCs. For example, I want to play 3D game on my old laptop while old desktop is being used to browse web or watch video at same time (i.e. full independent experience on each client). All machines will run Ubuntu.\nI'm not sure whether should I use several X11+VNC sessions on one host OS or use some virtualization technology to run two different guest OSes for clients on the server or may be other way. Can you please suggest me some solution?\nNote again, that the requirement is running heavy multimedia apps, that require full-resolution full-color motion picture (at >30fps), sound and lagfree mouse/keyboard input transferring over a network.Sorry for my poor English please.\n\nA: To use your server's computing power on the old machines, log on from the old machine using \"ssh -X\" from a terminal and execute the program. That will forward the X output to your old machine using the local X-server while using your server to do the computations. You can of course write scripts to execute often used programs. And to avoid typing your password all the time, you should add your public ssh keys to the servers known_hosts. That should work fine for browsing the web, etc.\nHeavy multimedia stuff and playing 3D games doing this will most probably still not be too much fun and not guaranteed to be lag-free (quite the contrary, actually) and forwarding sound is not even included, yet.\nFor watching video or listening to music, you could set up streaming servers on your server and then connect from your old client machines, but that will still use your old machines computational power to decompress the (mpeg-)stream.\nAnyway, to use more of your server's hardware I'd then go on exporting the home directory on the server using NFS and mount them on your old machines. And then continue by using nis/yp to synchronize the accounts over all of your machines.\nI promise, that will be exciting, but for your requirements, maybe buying a couple of SSDs and some more RAM for your old machines will do the trick better.\nSo, this is not really a solution to your requirements, but maybe gives you some ideas where to look further or maybe to adjust your requirements and change the setup of your systems. For example, I'd highly recommend to do heavy multimedia stuff and playing 3d games directly on the server, while using the old machines for browsing the web, remote controlling the server, playing music and especially non-multimedia applications.\nCheers \n", "Q: Problem removing apcupsd package from Ubuntu 12.04 I have recently installed apcupsd package from my system and then decided to remove it.\nWhen I try to remove it it fails.Below is some info:\n> uname -a Linux 3.5.0-26-generic #42~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Mon\n> Mar 11 22:17:58 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n> \n> sudo apt-get -f install apcupsd Reading package lists...

You could use 'eval', however with modern versions of 'bash' the cleanest way imho is via an array\ninput=( \"/tmp/dir1\" \"/tmp/dir2\" \"/tmp/dir3\" )\n\nfor i in {0,1,2}; do echo \"${input[i]}\"; done\n\n(note that bash arrays are zero-indexed); or to list all elements you can use\nfor i in \"${input[@]}\"; do echo \"$i\"; done\n\n\nA: I agree that using an array as shown in other answers is a better way to solve the real task of the OP.\nBut these answers do not directly answer the question as stated, so I'll do that:\nHere is how you can do that with eval to access the variables, following closely the way the OP gave as his code:\nINPUT1=/tmp/dir1\nINPUT2=/tmp/dir2\nINPUT3=/tmp/dir3\n\nfor i in {1..3} ; do\n    eval \"echo \\$INPUT$i\"\ndone\n\nOutput:\n/tmp/dir1\n/tmp/dir2\n/tmp/dir3\n\n\nA: The best way is to define INPUT variable as an array:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nINPUT[1]=/tmp/dir1\nINPUT[2]=/tmp/dir2\nINPUT[3]=/tmp/dir3\n\nfor i in \"${INPUT[@]}\"\ndo \necho $i     #or $INPUT[$i]\ndone\n\nSee also: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-for-loop-array/\n\nA: bash actually supports something pretty close to what you first tried.\nINPUT1=/tmp/dir1\nINPUT2=/tmp/dir2\nINPUT3=/tmp/dir3\n\nfor s in INPUT{1..3}; do\n    echo ${!s}\ndone\n\nThis works because:\n\n\n*\n\n*INPUT{1..3} expands to INPUT1 INPUT2 INPUT3. (It's equivalent to INPUT{1,2,3}.)\n\n*Where $s is the expansion of s, ${!s} is the expansion of the expansion of s.\nFor example, in the first iteration of the loop, if $s appeared it would be expanded to INPUT1. If $INPUT1 appeared it would be expanded to /tmp/dir1. Thus ${!s} is expanded to /tmp/dir1.\nThis kind of parameter expansion is called indirect expansion. In this situation and many like it, the built-in ! syntax achieves this more compactly and elegantly than eval.\nFor more information, see Is it possible to build variable names from other variables in bash? on Stack Overflow.\nSome caveats (which also apply to some of the other answers that have been posted):\n\n\n*\n\n*If any values of INPUTn may contain whitespace1 (like spaces2, tabs, or newlines) or constructions with special characters that would be expanded (such as $varname), quoting should be used.\nSingle quotes for the assignment are best if you want to prevent all expansion there:\nINPUT1=/tmp/dir1 → INPUT1='/tmp/dir with   spaces'\n(Only a ' quote character is treated specially, as it will act as the closing quote mark.)\nBut use double quotes to still allow the variable to be expanded:\necho ${!s} → echo \"${!s}\"\n(This works even if the value after expansion contains a $. The expanded contents are not expanded again.\nFor example, BAZ=QUUX FOO='BAR   $BAZ'; echo \"$FOO\" prints BAR   $BAZ, not BAR   QUUX.)\n\n*If any of INPUTn might take on a value that echo would interpret as an option instead of text to print, replace echo with printf '%s\\n'.3\nCurrently this is - followed by one more e, E, or n. But you should probably consider anything starting with - as dangerous in case future bash versions add new options.\n\nAlthough, in terms of syntax, indirect expansion as presented above is nearly as simple as doing it with an array, you still may wish to use an array because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It may better reflect the underlying meaning of the problem you're trying to solve.\n\n*You might have use for other features of arrays in solving this problem.\n\n\nPerhaps you intended /tmp/dir1, /tmp/dir2, and /tmp/dir3 as opaque examples that may be replaced by anything.\nBut if you really want to make an array of those specific values, I recommend:\ninput=(/tmp/dir{1..3})\n\nSimilarly, if your goal is just to loop through /tmp/dir1, /tmp/dir2, and /tmp/dir3 and perform some action with each, then you don't need to store them in any kind of variable:\nfor s in /tmp/dir{1..3}; do\n    echo $s\ndone\n\nIf the values of s will contain whitespace or special characters (see above), quote them, but leave the {...} range unquoted by separately quoting the text to the left and right of it--it won't be expanded if quoted, even in double quotes.\nfor s in '/tmp/dir '{1..3}' with  spaces'; do\n    echo \"$s\"\ndone\n\nThat prints:\n/tmp/dir 1 with  spaces\n/tmp/dir 2 with  spaces\n/tmp/dir 3 with  spaces\n\nAnd if your goal is really just to print /tmp/dir1, /tmp/dir2, and /tmp/dir3, each on its own line, then this single command3 is sufficient:\nprintf '%s\\n' /tmp/dir{1..3}\n\n\n1: The shell splits text into words on whitespace or, if the IFS variable is defined, on the field separators it specifies. But you usually don't have to worry about IFS unless you've set it yourself.\n2: echo hello world actually does work: it prints hello world, just like echo 'hello world'. This is because echo prints a single space between each echoed argument. However, echo hello   world is not equivalent to echo 'hello   world': the former still prints hello world while latter prints hello   world.\n3: For more information on bash's printf builtin, see the output of help printf or this section of the Bash manual. printf is also an executable that can be called from other shells (and in that capacity is standardized).\n", "Q: Open Python file with IDLE using Terminal on Ubuntu 12.04 How can I open python file (from desktop) with IDLE, using Terminal on Ubuntu 12.04?\nI have tried to do this way:\n$ idle open python_file.py\n\nInstead of open my file it's create two more files: open and  python_file.py.\n\nA: It's just\nidle python_file.py\n\nIf you want it to run in the background (returning control to the terminal so you can type other commands), add '&'\nidle python_file.py &\n\nIf you want it to continue running even if you close the terminal you can 'disown' it\nidle python_file.py & disown\n\n\nA: You do not need to use the 'open' term.\nThe help says:\nidle.py [-c command] [-d] [-e] [-s] [-t title] [arg] ...\n\n-c command  run this command\n-d          enable debugger\n-e          edit mode; arguments are files to be edited\n-s          run $IDLESTARTUP or $PYTHONSTARTUP first\n-t title    set title of shell window\n\nYou can just do this:\nidle file_you_want_to_open.py \nor \nidle.py file_you_want_to_open.py\n\nIf the file doesn't exist then it will be created.\n\nA: You can also directly open idle by typing :\n idle\n\nin the terminal and then click on \n File >> New File or Open File\n\noption to select or open your file , write your program and execute it .

Reinstall it, than try installing python3.3 again. If you have other packages installed that depend on libpython3.3-minimal, they may need to be reinstalled too.\nNote: For next time, manually installed software should go in /usr/local or /opt, never to /usr directly. That avoids conflict between manually installed files and packages, because all packages are installed to /usr.\n\nA: To install python version 3.3.2 here are the steps I followed and it worked\nwget http://python.org/ftp/python/3.3.2/Python-3.3.2.tar.bz2\n\ntar -xvjf ./Python-3.3.2.tar.bz2\n\ncd ./Python-3.3.2\n\n./configure --prefix=/opt/python3.3\n\nmake && make install\n\nmkdir ~/bin\n\nln -s /opt/python3.3/bin/python ~/bin/py\n\necho 'alias py=\"/opt/python3.3/bin/python3\"' >> .bashrc\n\n\nA: Since you have 'destroyed' parts of you Python install---as Jan Hudec points out---installing python3.3 fails because dpkg thinks other packages are still there. Check for the packages that were affected by your action: \n# dpkg -S /usr/lib/python3.3/\npython3-gdbm:i386, python3.3, libpython3.3-minimal:i386, libpython3.3-stdlib:i386, libpython3.3:i386: /usr/lib/python3.3\n\nAnd reinstall explicitly all packages that provides files under that directory. This will ensure that the file /usr/lib/python3.3/py_compile.py and others that are pre-depends will be there at the right time during install and that any files that are affected by your action get repaired. \nNote: Your output from above command may differ, adjust the following accordingly.\n# aptitude reinstall python3-gdbm python3.3 libpython3.3-minimal libpython3.3-stdlib libpython3.3\n\n", "Q: Cron job not running I have created a script \n#!/bin/bash\n echo \"tredor\"\n\nIf I run it using command line, it works, but when I move it to being a cron job, it doesn't. \nIn crontab -e , I entered the following code\n*/5 * * * *  root ./my_script\n\nI expect to see an output \"tredor\" every 5 minutes but that is no happening.

I couldn't find any Linux drivers for your integrated SiS graphics card. Maybe you'd be better off running your original Windows on this computer. \nOtherwise if you're determined to try Ubuntu, you should test it by running it from a live CD before you install anything! You have no 3D graphics support, so you'd be better off trying Xubuntu 32-bit, preferably Xubuntu 12.04 which is a Long Term Support release supported by updates until April, 2015, instead of 13.04 which is supported by updates only until January, 2014.\n", "Q: What is changelog.Debian.gz file during packaging? while packaging I encountered following error\ndh_builddeb\ndpkg-deb: building package `remotedevicecontroller' in `../remotedevicecontroller_1.0-1_i386.deb'.\n dpkg-source -b remotedevicecontroller-1.0\ndpkg-source: info: using source format `3.0 (quilt)'\ndpkg-source: error: unwanted binary file: debian/remotedevicecontroller/usr/share/doc/remotedevicecontroller/changelog.Debian.gz\ndpkg-source: error: detected 1 unwanted binary file (add it in debian/source/include-binaries to allow its inclusion).\ndpkg-buildpackage: error: dpkg-source -b remotedevicecontroller-1.0 gave error exit status 29\n\nwhy is the file being created by debian-helper and why is it again asking to include it in some other directory?\n\nA: Seems that the build wasn't clean, or you included more options that weren't by default. The changelog.Debian.gz is a gzip compressed list of the change made to the source package done by the Debian maintainer. You can either delete/prevent the generation of the file, or add the path to debian/source/include-binaries:\n$ cat debian/source/include-binaries\n[...]\n/usr/share/doc/remotedevicecontroller/changelog.Debian.gz\n[...]\n\n", "Q: Can we get Xenserver VMs provisioned by MAAS? currently i am using KVM, and KVM vms can be managed by MAAS but i am wondering, is it possible that Xenserver VMs will also work?\n\nA: We don't support managing VMs with MAAS - though I'm glad it's working for you - so the answer is that we don't support Xen VMs directly from MAAS either. MAAS really is intended only for managing physical machines.\nHowever, you can use MAAS with Juju to deploy OpenStack; the nova-compute charm has support for Xen.\n", "Q: Catalyst Control Center (Administrative) prompts for password, then won't open? I have a fresh (non-wubi) Ubuntu 13.04 x64 install, with successfully installed AMD Radeon HD 7870 drivers that were obtained by Software & Updates > Additional Drivers > AMD Graphics accelerators from fglrx-updates (proprietary). I rebooted after installing these drivers and my system was running 100 times better. I also noticed that I had the Catalyst Control Center all of the sudden, so I went to configure my (2) displays there. But when I try to open CCC as admin, a terminal-like window appears, and asks for my password. I enter the correct password, then I see a quick flash that says: 'su: Authentication Failed' (i think...). I searched online for a resolution and found an old thread from Ubuntu 11.xx and then opened a terminal, typed sudo amdcccle. This opened the program just fine. I got my monitors configured nicely... The problem still persists however!\nSO! What I am trying to figure out is: How do I correct the failed password authentication that occurs when I attempt to launch the program via Unity bar?\n\nA: I thought I'd make another answer (can't comment ffs) seeing as though I got this issue on a clean 14.04 install and it took me another step to get it to work\nFirst thing I did was run\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\nAs Remy5460 said, but I was just getting a graphical prompt that told me my password was wrong instead! To fix this, all I had to do was run\ngksu-properties\n\nand set Authentication mode to sudo rather than su\nIt's a shame a bug like this would persist onto an LTS release. This is one of the kind of reasons Ubuntu isn't more mainstream :/\n\nA: Ok I know this was an old question but since it is the first thing that shows up when I run a search, I figured I would post what fixed it for me. Found the fix here. \nhttp://ubuntulife.co.za/forums/showthread.php?tid=71\nIf the link doesn't work this was the command needed.\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\n", "Q: Using windows exported \".rdp\" file from Ubuntu I got this \".rdp\" remoteAPP file from work which enables me to run a specific application from the terminal server, I can open it easily using windows with a double click, are there any ways to open this kind of files from Ubuntu ? \n\nA: From the terminal this worked for me:\nremmina -c Downloads/somemachine.rdp \n\nThe command line help says:\n$ remmina  --help\n...\n-c, --connect=FILE          Connect to a .remmina file\n\nOlder versions of remmina don't understand the line administrative session:i:1 in files produced by the azure portal, so you either need to upgrade remmina to a more recent version of comment out that line in the file (prefix with # works).\n\nA: You can use Remmina, which is default application for remote desktop in Ubuntu from version 11.04. \nFrom Remmina main menu select Tools -> Import and select your .rdp file. It will be imported and added to your saved connections in Remmina and you can use it anytime you start Remmina.\n\nA: Remmina works on Linux Mint 17.3 (Ubuntu 14.04 based)\nhowever I could not get it to work directly with the .rdp file. Neither via import nor per double click. \nwhat actually worked fine was:\nopening the .rdp file with a texteditor. Copy pasting server name and gateway name to remmina. \nedit: this also saves me from having to download the .rdp file, searching for it on my computer, etc. \n\nA: Drag and drop the rdp file in the Remmima inbuilt application. Select the connection and edit the details like password. Connect it. Should work fine.\n\nA: I use KDE so I prefer krdc.\nHere is a small script for running krdc with options from .rdp file.\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n#\nkrdc `awk '\n/^full address:s:/ { sub(\"full address:s:\",\"\"); sub(\"\\015\",\"\"); host=$1; next}\n/^username:s:/ { sub(\"username:s:\",\"\"); sub(\"\\015\",\"\"); user=$1; next}\nEND { \n  printf \"rdp://%s@%s\\n\", user, host \n}\n' $1`\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy above text to a file\n\n*Change file mode adding exec bit (chmod a+x file) \n\n*Run the file with your .rdp file as a parameter\n\n\nI have only implemented basic parameters - user and hostname.\nFeel free to implement others.\nYou may also use other rdp program - just change the name in the script.\nThe script provides parameter in a format rdp://user@host.\n\nA: To connect with Remmina from Ubuntu 20.04 I eventually found that I had to use two different usernames. The first is my email address, the second is a numeric id our institution also often use.\nThe email address is used as the \"Remote Desktop Gateway username\". The numeric id is the \"Username\" for the actual machine you finally connect to.\n\n*\n\n*Either drag and drop your rdp file onto Remmina, or select \"Import\" from the hamburger menu towards the top-right.\n\n*A line of connection information should appear in Remmina. Right-click on it and choose \"Edit\".\n\n*Ensure the \"Basic\" tab is active.\n\n*Enter your \"Username\" (for me this is a numeric id).\n\n*Enter the \"Domain\".\n\n*Ensure the \"Advanced\" tab is active.\n\n*Enter your \"Remote Desktop Gateway username\" (for me this was my email address).\n\n*Enter your \"Remote Desktop Gateway domain\" (for me this was the same as at step 5, and needed in both these places).\n\n*Choose \"Save\" to return to the main Remmina window.\n\n*Either double-click on the line of connection information; or right-click it and select \"Connect\". A new pop-up window should soon appear, entitled \"Enter RDP authentication credentials\".\n\n*Enter your password.\n\n*Click OK.\n\nThat's it. The first option I wanted to change upon connecting was \"Toggle Dynamic Resolution Update\", which is on the left.\n\nA: What worked for me in Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon:\n\n*\n\n*Open Remmina.\n\n*Click New Connection.\n\n*Import the downloaded .RDP file (drop-down menu on the top right corner).\n\n*Fill in Username and Password.\n\nThat's it.\nYou only have to fiddle next with the resolution.\nAnd it seems you will have to do this procedure each time you want to make a connection next time, i..e start a New Connection each time.\n", "Q: What is a full path name? I would like to understand what full path name really means. I have a file in my home directory called my_script. I assumed the full path name is ./my_script, meaning that it is in the root folder, but I am not sure. Can someone please enlighten me on that?\n\nA: Full path name really means the full path to that file or folder from the filesystem's / directory.\nFor example, the full path to your script is:\n/home/your_username/my_script\n\nOr, the full path name to the grep executable is \n/bin/grep\n\nAs for the ./my_script, the symbol . stands for the current directory, so you actuallly say \"Look under the current directory for a file or folder named my_script\"\n\nA: No, your assumption is wrong. The full path name for my_script file from your home directory is: /home/your_user_name/my_script. When you type ./my_script in terminal you actually try to execute the script (if is executable) and it will be executed only if your current working directory is /home/your_user_name/. To execute the script you can use also the full file path which is, as I said /home/your_user_name/my_script.\nIt is believed that a UNIX path name looks and feels like Internet addresses, thus result into compatibility. The full path name of the current working directory can be found in terminal by using the following command:\npwd\n\nTo find out the full path for your user home directory, you can use:\necho ~\necho $HOME\necho /home/$USER\n\nThe above three commands are equivalent. \nTo find out the full path name for a file you can use readlink command. For example, in your case:\ncd ~\nreadlink -f my_script\n\n\nA: In order to understand the full path, you must first know the starting point.\nThe root directory / it is the starting point of *nix based operating systems. It contains all the other directories both system's and user's.\nUser's home directory /home/USERNAME/ or ~/ for short, contains user's files and directories. For example Pictures, Music, Documents, etc. Each of these directories is referenced as /home/USERNAME/DIRECTORY for example Documents is located at /home/USERNAME/Documents. \nLike with directories, files are referenced in the same way, for example a file named my_script located at the home directory of the user sosytee can be referenced using the full path /home/sosytee/my_script or ~/my_script for short.\nBoth files and directories can be referenced/accessed using their full paths from everywhere in the system. Additionally one can access them using only their name if it is in the same directory. For example if the user is at ~/ when using the terminal, he can access my_script file by using just  my_script.\nAdditionally one can access  directories and files by using their name only, if they are placed at his PATH variable. You can see what is store in PATH by using echo $PATH. \nSimple examples on how to access files using the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*The user is currently at /home/USERNAME/ and wants to use the cat command on a file located at /home/USERNAME/Documents named foo.txt:\n\n\ncat Documents/foo.txt\n\n\n*\n\n*The user is inside ~/Documents and wants to run a script named foo.sh located ad ~/Scripts/Foo:\nsh ../Scripts/Foo/foo.sh\nor\nsh ~/Scripts/Foo/foo.sh\nby all means this is just a summary.\nFurther information\n\n\n*\n\n*Bash Guide for Beginners, by Machtelt Garrels\n\n*More about PATH here\n\n*About Unix directory structure\n\nA: The full path name is the path from the root directory (i.e., /).\n./my_script is the relative path name, because the path is given relatively to the current directory, which is denoted by ..\nSo if you are in your home directory the full path is s.th. like /home/sosytee/my_script. For your home directory there is the \"short-cut\" ~, meaning you can also write ~/my_script. But that will of course resolve to a different path for every user. \nTo see the full path of your current directory call pwd.\n\nA: \nI assumed the full path name is ./my_script\n\nNo, it is not. That path is relative. The point at the beginning indicates the current directory:\n$ ls ./my_script\nmy_script\n$ cd ..\n$ ls ./my_script\nls: cannot access ./my_script: No such file or directory\n\nAs you can see, I changed the directory and the my_script is not found, which means that ./my_script is not an absolute path.\n\nI assumed the full path name is ./my_script, meaning that it is in the root folder, but I am not sure.\n\nFrom the Wikipedia:\n\n[...] A full path or absolute path is a path that points to the same location on one file system regardless of the working directory or combined paths.\n\nSince the ./my_script don't fill the condition that whenever I'm I can find the my_script file, we should infer that is a relative path.\n\nA relative path is a path relative to the working directory of the user or application, so the full absolute path will not have to be given.\n\n\nA: Here... i assume you're asking because you installed Ubuntu server on windows...\ncopy this code to your folder explorer on windows %userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\nthat will show you the home location... its hidden somewhere on your system \nIn this folder, double-click the folder for the Linux distribution whose files you want to view:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu: CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\n\n*openSUSE Leap 42: 46932SUSE.openSUSELeap42.2_022rs5jcyhyac\n\n*SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 1246932SUSE.SUSELinuxEnterpriseServer12SP2_022rs5jcyhyac\n\n\nThe names of these folders may slightly change  in the future.

How to increase the priority for a task in linux machine?\nWhat I've Done So Far: After small research i found that we can increase the priority to a task using NICE command and if we want to increase the priority for an existing task, then we can also use RENICE command\nBut my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*In some tutorials its mentioned that, NICE values vary from 0 to 99, But in some tutorials states that NICE values vary from -20 to 19. Which one is correct?\n\n*How to increase the NICE value for an GUI task? If we are doing copy using terminal then I can increase its priority using NICE command But How to increase the priority of a task done using GUI(for ex: copying files from USB to System through GUI)\n\n*Is that possible to set the priority of a task for the life time? I want to set highest priority for \"COPYING FILES IN SYSTEM(using GUI) permanently\nIs there anyone who can help me to set the highest priority for a task(task done through GUI)?\n\nA: I think you should ask in Unix & Linux but in any case, the ones that say that NICE values for CPU in Linux vary from 0 to 99 are just for Real Time OS. The nice values are between -20 to 20, being -20 the higher priority, in normal (the one that most of users uses) *NIX kernels for CPU. Which is for most cases.\nAlso, the file copying wouldn't need actually that much CPU (depending the filesystems) but the I/O priority. From kernel 2.6.26 the ionice values are determined by the CPU nice values using the following formulae:\nio_priority = (cpu_nice + 20) / 5\n\nAlso, all process (unless modified source code) starts with \"Best effort\" priority class which uses the formulae above. But, in any case, you probably don't need to set this as default.\nA way to set the I/O priority to start a process is doing:\nionice -c2 -n6 SOME_COMMAND\n\nProcess that would like to set/get their own I/O scheduling class and priority should use the ioprio_set and ioprio_get functions.\nAlso a nice warning from Linux Poison:\n\nRead the description for realtime carefully. Realtime IO nice processes will starve the system completely until they are done using the disk. You can easily make your system non responsive for long periods of time.\nAlso, IO niceness only has effect if you are using the CFQ io scheduler . If you have an elevator= (as, deadline,noop) line in your menu.lst, IO niceness will have no effect.\n\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*http://linux.die.net/man/1/ionice\n\n*http://linux.die.net/man/2/ioprio_set\n\nA: You are looking for: Auto Nice Daemon\n\nThe auto nice daemon activates itself in certain intervals and\n  renices jobs according to their priority and CPU usage. Jobs owned by\n  root are left alone. Jobs are never increased in their priority.\n  The renice intervals can be adjusted as well as the default nice level\n  and the activation intervals. A priority database stores\n  user/group/job tuples along with their renice values for three CPU\n  usage time ranges. Negative nice  levels are interpreted as signals to\n  be sent to a process, triggered by CPU usage; this way, Netscapes\n  going berserk can be killed automatically. The strategy for searching\n  the priority database can be configured.     AND also provides\n  network-wide configuration files with host-specific sections, as well\n  as wildcard/regexp support for commands in the priority database.\n  Homepage: http://and.sourceforge.net/\n\nYou can easy install it on your Ubuntu:\n# aptitude install and\n\nAnd modify config file:\n# vi /etc/and.priorities\n\nYou say:\n\nIs that possible to set the priority of a task for the life time? I\n  want to set highest priority for \"COPYING FILES IN SYSTEM(using GUI)\n  permanently\n\nIt depend on what kind of GUI you are prefer.

I will be accessing the files at my workplace through a VPN so firewall issues are not a problem in this case. \nI would like to be able to have it appear as though I have all my works computers files, but at home. I need to do some development using IDE's from home and it is essential that I am able to navigate to the directory for the sake of the IDE. \nI've heard of Samba shares. Is this a good choice, or are there better options out there? If Samba share suits what I want to do I thought the following guide on the Ubuntu Forums would be ideal:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=288534\nEdit: Home computer will be using Ubuntu 12.04 as well and the VPN aspect of this is already setup and working. This is a matter of how the sharing should be done.\n\nA: SSH\nI would suggest git, but since you want access to all the files you might also want to try SSH.\nAdvantageous over Samba\n\n\n*\n\n*I have found samba to be slow at times.\n\n*At times editing a file is not possible because of the permission setup being wrong.\n\n*Connection is encrypted. \n\n\nWork computer setup\nYou simple install an ssh server on the work computer. Openssh will work which you can install using\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nHome computer\nOn the home computer go to nautilus, click file -> Connect to Server and choose SSH as service type. In server put the IP (or alais) address of the work computer, port should be 22, root folder ('/') for folder is fine and in user name the name of the user for the work computer (root is NOT recommended).\nI don't have a 12.04 install so there might also be a password field to fill in (can't remember if 12.04's nautilus has one).\n\nA: I suppose sshfs is a good idea. I use it often for a secure / encrypted link to my NAS server when I am at the workplace, for various stuff, including listening to music stored on the remote server.\nsudo apt-get install sshfs for the client side should be just enough. For the server side you might go with the default setup of openssh-server (or change most stuff, whatever works for you).\nBasically, you just mount a remote dir in local dir, just as with mount command.\nsshfs user@server:/remote/dir /local/dir [-p non_standard_port]\n\nAs it is a user-controlled mount, unmount it with fusermount -u /local/dir.\nIt is secure and simple. You may set up /etc/fstab with sshfs too.\nSome more info in here.\n\nA: What your looking for is a SAMBA/CIFS or NFS fileshare server for your work computer. If the VPN connection is sometimes down, then maybe SAMBA is the better choice. \nNFS require the connection to be always up, to be able to have it mounted all the time on your home computer. But you can have your home directory unified at work and at home if you want.\nIf you have a mixed environment with linux, windows and mac then Samba is more supported.\nSo here is what i did to make it work:\n\nsudo apt-get install samba\n\nand to configure with a gui:\n\nsudo apt-get install system-config-samba\n\nand then applying my changes:\n\nsudo smbd reload\n\nThis is my research, I only tried Samba myself:\nGuide to setting up NFS\nGuide to setting up Samba\n", "Q: Wget and Lynx not working, but apt-get working behind proxy I have done:  \nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"ftp://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport https_proxy=\"https://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport socks_proxy=\"socks://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\n\nI have done changes in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ directory for proxy. apt-get is working, but lynx, wget are not working. How to do using command-line. I have access only through ssh.\n\nA: In this case, you can use wget with --no-proxy option. For example:\nwget --no-proxy www.google.ro\n\nAnd lynx with PROTOCOL_proxy option. For example:\nlynx PROTOCOL_proxy www.google.ro\n\n\nA: Is not clear if your problem is that wget and lynx don't run behind a proxy while apt-get do, and Radu's answers throws me out the loop. But I will throw a stab in the dark:\nFrom the export's I can guess that you are trying to set a proxy to work in the current session. Since Linux is Case Sensitive, if you set one but not both cases, you could run into problems:\nenv | grep -i http_proxy\nhttp_proxy=http://localhost:3128/\nHTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:3128/\n\nAs you can see my environment uses both http_proxy and HTTP_PROXY so you must do the same:\nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"ftp://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport https_proxy=\"https://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport socks_proxy=\"socks://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport HTTP_PROXY=\"http://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport FTP_PROXY=\"ftp://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=\"https://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\nexport SOCKS_PROXY=\"socks://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\n\nWith this, we could be almost sure that if any program follow the environment variables will use the proxy. Now for the specific case of wget you can set the proxy manually in the ~/wgetrc file:\nhttp_proxy=\"http://proxy.institute.edu:3128/\"\n\nFor lynx you should use PROTOCOL_proxy variable where the word \"PROTOCOL\" is replaced by lowercase http, ftp, https, etc... Lynx read the variables from your environment and if you have everything correctly set up you shall no have problems.\n", "Q: Unable to Execute VLC from PHP I am running uBuntu 12.04.3, 32 bit OS on a 8 CPU, 8GB RAM 64-bit Intel Xeon machine.

Like a remote ALSA or Pulseaudio server.\n\nA: Gentlemen,\nI have been able to solve this issue by using the following steps...\n\n\n*\n\n*Install vlc nox version\n\n*In the PHP file:\n  echo shell_exec(\"sh /var/www/play1.sh\");\n\n*In the play1.sh file:\n  #!/bin/sh\n  vlc -Idummy /var/www/media.ts --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ts,dst=:1935/}'\n\n*Invoke the PHP file via a browser and VLC will start streaming to port 1935\nTo access the file from the client end...\n1) Point VLC or any media player to the URL + Port. Ex. http://www.something.com:1935\n2) The client player will start to receive the file and play it back.\nNow the next step is to enable this file on demand.

What happened is that while I was trying to recover external USB drive I opened the standard Windows Disk Management tool and it prompted me if I want to make disk1 \"active\". At that moment I didn't realize that \"disk1\" is not my USB disk, but the ext4 internal disk. After clicking OK, Windows has created a 100MB \"system reserved partition\" on the disk and left the rest untouched.\nWhen I logged back in to Linux, the partition was not mounted. I deleted the created by Windows 100MB NTFS \"system reserved partition\" and tried to run Testdisk. Testdisk sees my old ext4 partition, but at the end tells something like \"no partition can be recovered\".\nIs it possible to get back my partition and directory structure + data? The problem is that I had there all my programs (C/C++) and working directories as well as some experimental data, i.e. files which don't have specific headers like jpg or pdf. Is there a way to recover this data? Can I, for instance, recover part of the partition, let's say whatever is above 100MB?\nP.S. Please let's avoid \"you should have done a backup\"-like comments.. :) I had a backup, but it was stored on the USB drive which I was trying to recover first.. (a general disk failure, disk is not readable).\n\nA: You may have run into this problem, but that's not really clear. If so, yours is the first case of its kind that I've heard of, and you can thank the GNU parted developers for sitting on a fix for over two years.\nAs a practical matter, your best bet for recovery is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Optional, but strongly recommended.) Do a low-level backup of the damaged disk. For instance, sudo dd if=/dev/sdc of=/path/to/backup.img backs up /dev/sdc (if that's the damaged disk) to /path/to/backup.img (you can change this target directory or filename, if you like). Obviously you must have sufficient free space in /path/to to hold the backup. This means you may need to buy a new backup disk, prepare it, and mount it at /path or /path/to. You can skip this step, but then if you make matters worse, it will become harder to recover -- perhaps to the point of becoming impossible to recover.\n\n*Use fdisk (if the disk used MBR) or gdisk (if the disk used GPT) to re-create your original partitions. Since you say you had a single partition on the disk, chances are that it started at sector 2048 and extended to the end of the disk. Thus, deleting the current partition(s) and re-creating that one may work. Do not create a fresh filesystem on the disk; just create an empty partition. (GParted likes to create a fresh filesystem and so should be avoided. It's possible to get it to create an empty partition, but why take the risk?)\n\n*Reboot. (This just ensures that you're using the new partition table. There are less radical ways to do this, but this one is easy to describe.)\n\n*Run e2fsck on the partition you just created. If you're very very lucky, it may locate enough of the ext4fs data structures to bring the disk back to live, although probably with some missing files or other problems. You might want to use fsck.ext4 to make sure, that it recognizes properly that it is a ext4 filesystem. Fiddling with e2fsck options (such as -b) may improve your odds of recovering data, but these options are very advanced. See the e2fsck man page for details.\n\n*If this fails, run PhotoRec on the disk. This should enable recovery of individual files, although they'll probably lack filenames or any sort of organization, so you'll need to sift through them to figure out what they all are.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*For recovery I was using only the \"dd\"-copy of the disk:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdd\n\n(\"sdb\" is the damaged disk and \"sdd\" is the one I used for tests)\n\n\n*First, I used \"gdisk\" to create a new empty GUID partition table (option -o). \n$ sudo gdisk /dev/sdd\nCommand (? for help):   \n$ o\nThis option deletes all partitions and creates a new protective MBR.\nProceed? (Y/N): \n$ y\n$ w\n\n\n*I tried sudo e2fsck /dev/sdd - unsuccessful (first superblock was corrupted)\n$ sudo e2fsck /dev/sdd\ne2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)\ne2fsck: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...\ne2fsck: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdd\n\nThe superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2\nfilesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2\nfilesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock\nis corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:\n    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>\n\n\n*then I did sudo mke2fs -n /dev/sdd  to list the superblocks\n$ sudo mke2fs -n /dev/sdd1\nmke2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)\n/dev/sdd is entire device, not just one partition!\nProceed anyway?

It copies data from one file or block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data in case of read errors. \nThe basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you don't have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log, run it in reverse mode, etc. \nFor more info, and to download ddrescue, see their website.\nUbuntu Rescue Remix is a GNU/Linux live system which runs from CD or USB flash device. It provides the data recovery specialist with a command-line interface environment equipped with the best free-libre, open source data recovery and forensics tools available. \nThere are also great products, but not free.  Such as R-STUDIO for Linux Data Recovery.\nYou can also try R-Studio.\n\nR-Studio is a family of powerful and cost-effective undelete and data\n  recovery software.

From what I can tell the array superblock sees the UUID for sdf that it was built on, but (for whatever reason) sdf isn't being detected.  This means that the RAID array is broken and so ubuntu set the file system to RO as a safety precaution.  I can still open, edit, and create files on / with no issue, the OS still runs perfectly, I just can't access the data on md128.  I haven't turned off the machine yet to remove the drive to see if it's failed or not.\nAbout a week ago the same issue (random switch to RO) occured, only that time it hit md1 (the SSDs).  When that happened the superblock was erased on md128.  I got lucky when reinstalling the OS and had it rebuild the RAID using the existing partitions (IE didn't format the partitions), and managed to recover 99.9% of the data (the files that were being accessed when it happened were corrupted).\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the current issue with md128 a problem that I managed to band-aid over until now or is this a sign of some deeper issue that I should be worried about?  \n\n*What is the best way to move on from here: replace sdf and restripe into md128, replace sdf and tear down/rebuild md128, or something else?\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the OP, I'm new to the forum and didn't read the formatting instructions, I've corrected it now\n\nA: Most likely sdf died some time ago and you did not notice.  Now sdd has some bad sectors.  The failed reads cause the filesystem to switch to read only.  You need to replace the failed drive, and fsck the filesystem.\n", "Q: after adding .sh file to profile.d, desktop background does can not change, can't mount other partitions, and can't access trash So I was configuring my jdk and appending my PATH variable, and I put the script to do that in profile.d:\n#!/bin/bash      \nJAVA_HOME=[where I had the jdk installed]\nPATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nexport PATH JAVA_HOME\nexport CLASSPATH=.\n\nI logged back in, and now I can't change my background from the default (It changed back), can't access the trash, and can't mount my window$ partition (to access those files).\nAnyone know what to do here?\n\nA: Files in profile.d are sourced, not executed.

Or should I do a separate backup for each account or something completely different? \n\nA: The user data base is not in /home. If you follow that approach, you will lose (or: mix up) the file ownerships. Each file and directory has a set of permissions, a user id (uid) and a group id (gid). Your backup tool saves all that, but it does not save the mapping from uid's to users and gid's to groups, since the involved number may be different on a fresh install. You will need to backup the files /etc/passwd, /etc/group for those mappings. If you want to backup passwords (encrypted) you also need the file /etc/shadow. However I would not just restore those files, but open them during restoring and use only the id's for recreating the users. \n$ # one user is in each line. the line for user jb is:\n$ grep jb /etc/passwd\njb:x:1002:1002:Jo Bo,,,:/home/jb:/bin/bash\n$ # the first 1002 denotes the uid, the second 1002 denotes the gid\n$ # let's recreate that user\n$ addgroup --gid 1002 jb && adduser --uid 1002 --gid 1002 jb\n\nThis works flawlessly given that you have one user that has admin rights and has been the first user created on both the old and the fresh system (during installation) and given that you did not create other groups or added user to some groups. If that's not true, you'd have to have a closer look at the differences between the file version. But that is not hard to figure out, what'd need to be done. \nWhat's nice to have are the encrypted passwords, which are in the /etc/shadow file. One example line:\njb:$6$HNJnBSsO$xE8vhxcSPGWbbUxqMRXpWq5Q9RrmwsRgRmn/mwjmQKEQKfI3AsGMyR5F4k7DMZouTXQvEKqcm1t592zKD/L0Q/:15943:0:99999:7:::\n\nThe long field between the : is the encrypted password. You can copy paste them to the new file. That way your users don't have to reset the passwords. \nEven if you lose all these files, you're not screwed. You can simply reassign the files in /home with the command chown -R <user>: /home/<user>. That may even be the preferred way. \nBut all of this assumes, that your system is used the most simple way, i.e. there is no software installed that holds valuable configuration work outside /home, inside user's folders are just files of the respective user, there are no special group assignments (two user share file via a common group) and so forth---or all of that can be recreated easily.\nIf you have more complex user/groups and want to transfer file ownerships properly and you feel lucky you can do a stunt like ...\nfind /home -uid <uid1> -print0 | xargs -r0 -- chown <tmpuid1> --\nfind /home -gid <gid1> -print0 | xargs -r0 -- chgrp <tempgid1> --\n....\nfind /home -uid <tmpuid1> print0 | xargs -r0 -- chown <newuid1> --\nfind /home -gid <tmpgid1> print0 | xargs -r0 -- chown <newgid1> --\n....\n\nCONCLUSION: \nJust backing up /home is perfectly fine for a desktop system if you know what you're doing/missing. Generally it is a good idea to test the desaster strategy!\n", "Q: video dead after upgrading nvidia drivers 12.04 I dual boot windows and ubuntu.

I was on 304 I think, and the OS recommended 311.\nI downloaded and installed the new drivers. It says to reset, so I log out, but then all I have is a blinking cursor instead of the login screen (where I would have reset from.) I waited 30 minutes and nothing happened so I reset via holding the power button. \nNow when I boot I don't even see the Asus splash screen. Also, if I wait until I know grub is loaded and scroll down to windows (by memory, video is dead) I know it starts because I hear that dumb chimey sound, but still no video.\nI'm not that great at computers, and given I have no video to work with, I can only give information from memory. I've tried all my dvi and hdmi ports to no avail. I have a 660ti.\nI know its not much to go on, I'm just casting a net here.\n\nA: My sympathies go out to you because I have been using those exact drivers without any trouble at all. Well, here is something that may solve the issue:\nFirst, plug in your screen to the port that originally was plugged in to. If that doesn't work, try booting at least twice with each video port until it does work. BIOSes tend to be buggy.\nOnce you can at least boot and see a splash screen, boot into Ubuntu Recovery Menu at the Grub screen. Scroll down to Enable Networking and follow the process. Upon return to the main Recovery Mode menu, select the option to get to a Root Shell Prompt. Enter in this command and press Enter:\napt-get install --reinstall nvidia-304\n\nThen go back to the menu with exit, and then reboot. The issue should be solved.\n", "Q: Wireless network suddenly not working on 13.04 I installed Ubuntu 13.04 few days ago and it worked fine.

This has something to do with my problem?\n\nA: I am not show what you mean in cannot find any wi-fi cinnection.

Not a good solution, if it's an old os, but mine had nothing but few applications. It had something to do with the BIOS \"Wireless LAN Radio\" because now it turned on. Mysterious?

There is an icon that showed up on my dashboard after updating to 12.04 called \"install RELEASE\". When I go through steps to install it, I eventually get a notice saying:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is 'no operating system detected' on my computer\n\n*Would I like to 'erase and use entire disk', or 'specify partitions manually'.\n\n\nThis is alarming, and I don't know what it means. I also don't know if I even need RELEASE.\n\nA: The \"Install Ubuntu\" icon can say \"Install RELEASE\" if \"RELEASE\" is never replaced with the specific string identifying a particular Ubuntu version. For example, a corrupted installation image for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS might say \"Install RELEASE\" instead of \"Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\"\nIt seems this can also happen if there are \"pieces\" of the installer left over on an installed system--that is, if the ubiquity package is not successfully removed at the end of installation, or perhaps if some configuration files remain.\nSo there are two general causes of this:\nIf Ubuntu is already installed:\nIf Ubuntu is already installed, and you're seeing an \"Install RELEASE\" icon in your dash, then:\n\n*\n\n*You don't have to do anything. It shouldn't be there.\n\n*If you installed from installation media produced from a normal Ubuntu ISO image (rather than a modified image or an image for another OS), this is definitely a bug.\n\nSo, if Ubuntu is already installed, here's what to do:\n\n*\n\n*You don't need \"RELEASE.\" There is no such thing, it's remnants of the Ubuntu installer left over in the installed system. (Perhaps they were already there, and when you upgraded to a subsequent release, they somehow were shown. Or if you used a live CD/DVD/USB to upgrade, maybe that left them somehow.)\nDon't continue trying to install it; if it did install something, that would actually be bad, because your system is already installed.\n\n\n*If the \"Install RELEASE\" icon appears in the launcher on the left side of the screen, you can simply remove the \"Install RELEASE\" icon from there. Just right-click it and click \"Unpin.\"\n\n\n*If you installed from a normal installation ISO (as far as you know), you might want to report this as a bug. After reading that thoroughly, you'd start the bug reporting process by running ubuntu-bug ubiquity (as the bug would be in the ubiquity package). If that doesn't work, use other methods detailed in that guide.\n\n\n*You might be able to remove it and any other remnants of Ubuntu's installer that shouldn't be present in a fully installed system, by opening a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and running sudo apt-get remove ubiquity. If you're going to report the bug, it's best to do that first before performing this step.\nIn summary: If Ubuntu is already installed, you don't need to do anything, you shouldn't continue running \"Install RELEASE,\" and you can even remove it from the launcher.\nIf you have not yet installed Ubuntu (and your computer didn't come with it installed):\nIf you are trying to install Ubuntu but you see an \"Install RELEASE\" option instead of \"Install Ubuntu\" or \"Install Ubuntu 13.04\" (or some other version), then you probably have bad installation media. It could have been created from a corrupted ISO image, or it could have become damaged.\nSo, MD5 test your ISO image, and check your CD/DVD or USB flash drive for defects. (This problem is quite different but it may have the same cause, so see my answer there.)\nIf you're using unofficial installation media, like something created for your company, or you're installing some Ubuntu-based operating system that is not an official derivative, then you'll have to get help with this from the provider of the installation media or the support resources for the OS you're using.\nIf your installation medium appears good and this still happens, please provide more details (by editing your question, plus you may want to comment here as well).\n", "Q: Sharing torrents between Ubuntu and Windows I have a dual boot system with Ubuntu and Win7.

Thanks!\n\nA: As with most Unixy OSes, there are many ways to accomplish the same thing. What you have done works fine, and will work with most Ubuntu desktop environments.\nAnother way to do this (not using a true icon, but faster to implement) is to simply place the executable script on your desktop and double click it. This will prompt you to open the file or run it. If you click 'run' or 'run in terminal', it will lock the screen.\nI think that your way is the best. Just highlighting another way.\n\nA: Actually by going to \"Brightness & Lock\" in System Settings, and configure \n\"Lock screen after\" to \"Screen turn off\". \nAfter which, locking your session either from the top upper left screen or Ctrl + Shift + L, will lock and turn off ur screen. \n", "Q: How to install the sims 3... starter pack?

(g)parted aligns partitions to 1 MiB, which is more than enough to work properly with drives using 4k physical sectors, so it is fine the way it is.\n\nA: Changes have been made to both the Linux kernel and utilities to support Advanced Format drives. These changes ensure that all partitions on Advanced Format drives are properly aligned on 4K sector boundaries. Kernel support for Advanced Format drives is available in kernel versions 2.6.31 and above. Support for portioning and formatting Advanced Format drives is available in the following Linux utilities:\nFdisk: GNU Fdisk is a command line utility that partitions hard drives. Versions 1.2.3 and above support Advanced Format drives.\nParted: GNU Parted is a graphical utility for partitioning hard drives. Versions 2.1 and above support Advanced Format drives.\n4K native (4Kn) disks have a 4-KB logical sector size. Modern operating systems can store data on these disks, but they generally cannot boot from these disks. These disks are commonly external drives with USB connection.\nTo create a partition used as a media storage device, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 /dev/sdb1\n\nMost of the 4k disks have a physical sector size of 4096 bytes so that 3TB can fit on the plates, but they still have 512B logical sector size for compatibility with OSs that expect one sector to be 512B. That's why when you use the print command in parted to print the details, is says sector size logical/physical 512B/4096B. That's normal.\nThis \"conversion\" is done by the intelligence on the disk itself, and it's normal. It's how it should work.\nIf you can't see the whole 3TB first check in BIOS that it's not limiting the disk size. Maybe you need bios update to support the disk.\nAlso using parted to create partition starting from 0 which is a mistake. You need to start the first parttion on sector 2048 which is equivalent to 1MiB so that the partitions on the disk are aligned for optimal performance.\nSo, change the unit to MiB, print the disk details which will also print the disk size in MiB, and create the partition (if you only want single partition) starting from 1MiB and ending at the last MiB (or one before the last).\nFor example, a 3TB disk should have in reality something like 2,861,022 MiB. So creating a single partition spanning the whole disk on a disk device called /dev/sdX would be like (replace the X with the correct letter):\nsudo parted /dev/sdX\nunit MiB\nmklabel gpt\nprint (to see the total size in MiB)\nmkpart primary 1 2861022\nquit\n\nIf the disk size is few MiB more or less than 2861022 adjust the ending location.\nThat's it. After that create the filesystem you want on the partition. \nSources, and extra reading\n4K-sector drives and Linux\nError check and install 4k drives in Linux \nUbuntu Forums\n\nA: First, most Advanced Format drives present a logical sector size of 512 bytes, even though the physical sector size is 4096 bytes (4KiB). This is done through juggling data in the drive's firmware, and it can result in performance problems if the partitions are not properly aligned. Chances are this isn't the source of your problem, though, and your focus on partition alignment is misplaced. (To be sure, partition alignment is important; it's just not the source of your problem.)\nMy hunch (and it is just a hunch) is that your problem results from switching between a USB enclosure and direct connection of the disk. Some enclosures translate 512-byte logical sectors on the disk into 4096-byte logical sectors presented to the computer -- that is, the opposite of what the firmware in an Advanced Format disk does. I'm not positive, but I suspect that some enclosures do this only on over-2TiB disks. Both MBR and GPT partitioning schemes refer to data by sector numbers, so changing the sector size invalidates the partitioning data. Thus, if you prepare the disk in a USB enclosure that translates in this way and then try to use the disk directly (or vice-versa), you'll see errors because the partitions (and even GPT backup data) won't be where the computer expects it to be. It'd be like telling a blindfolded person to \"walk 2 forward,\" where you mean 2 feet, but the person thinks you mean 2 meters, and so walks into a wall.\nThe solution to this problem is to prepare and use the disk in one way -- either use the USB enclosure or use a direct connection, not both. If both are necessary for some reason, you'll need to find an enclosure that works without applying this type of translation.\nTo test my hypothesis, you can use a tool (like parted) that reports logical sector sizes. For instance:\nsudo parted /dev/sda print\nModel: ATA Hitachi HDP72505 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 500GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\n\nI've omitted a bunch of information from this output. The important detail is in the final line shown here: The logical and physical sector sizes are both 512 bytes. If you run this test, then reattach the disk in the other way and run it again, you can compare the results. If the logical sector size changes depending on how you attach the disk, then my hypothesis is correct and it's the source of your problem. Or at least, it's one problem; there may be others, too. In particular, the Error synchronizing after initial wipe error you mentioned could indicate another problem. OTOH, that could be a side effect of parted trying to read backup GPT data from beyond the end of the disk. Either way, if you see a change in logical sector size, you should address that issue before dealing with anything else. If you want to repartition the disk but have problems because of the Error synchronizing error, try using gdisk or cgdisk (in the gdisk package) rather than parted or GParted; the gdisk family is more robust against errors than is the parted family.\n\nA: As long as you align your partitions on a multiple of 4KB, you're fine.  You don't otherwise have to do anything special for drives with 4KB physical sectors.\nOld partitioning software aligned partitions on a multiple of 63x512B sectors, which will result in bad performance if the drive has 4KB physical sectors because that is 31 and a half KiloBytes, NOT a multiple of 4KB.\nVirtually no partitioning software available now in Ubuntu will do this anymore (unless you specifically request it to somehow).  Most will align to a multiple of 1MiB (2048x512B sectors, which is also 256x4KB sectors) by default.\nWhat would happen if you didn't align it?\nIf you don't align the partitions to multiples of 4KB, the worst that's going to happen is a performance loss (a fairly significant one for small files).  Drives with 4KB sectors tend to emulate 512B sectors for compatibility with existing systems.  So they function perfectly well if you just treat them as a 512B sector drive.  But when you write to a single 512B area, it will rewrite a whole 4KB sector.\nSo, for performance reasons it's important to ensure that the 4KB clusters you use in your filesystem align with the 4KB sectors on the drive, so that a single cluster write won't result in needing to write two 4KB sectors on the drive.\n", "Q: Split partition with Ubuntu 13.04 and windows 7 How do I split the partition without loosing my windows OS and files .I am mainly concerned about the new table.\n\nA: From my experience:\nMake a note of how much \"stuff\" you've installed on your hard drive.

So, first, I have a problem after rebooting, because of that I had to remove the .xbindkeysrc file. \nI was in the hard process of trying to create the simple mapping of Right Alt to Left Alt + F1 in the system. I was going to use xbindkeys to map F13 to  Alt + F1 and xmodmap to map Right Alt to F13...\nHow do I map Right Alt to Left Alt + F1 so that I get hide/unhiding of the Launcher with a single key?\n\nA: First of all, by default, Left Alt + F1 shortcut is not for hide/unhide the Launcher. This shortcut is used to give keyboard-focus to the Launcher. This means: gives keyboard-focus to the Launcher so it can be navigated with the cursor-keys. If you don't trust me, run the following command in terminal:\ngsettings get org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ keyboard-focus\n\nNow, to change Left Alt + F1 shortcut with another one, you can use the following command:\ngsettings set org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ keyboard-focus 'new_shortcut'\n\nFor example, to change it to Right Alt + F1, use:\ngsettings set org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ keyboard-focus '<Mod5>F1'\n\nThis works for mykeyboard (I mean \"<Mod5>\" for Right Alt key).

It was because of massive disk I/O operation, presumably to swap disk. I tried to tweak swapiness factor and it didn't affect anything at all on both sides of the extreme. I decided to delete the swap partition altogether, since my system has 4GB RAM. The swap partition was about 6GB. It is yet no difference.

Can anyone please explain? Is there any other setting I could tweak to get the bar of memory usage up to say %95?\nThanks\n\nA: Linux uses all unused RAM for disk cache ('cached' value in free).

How? I encrypted a headless server with cryptsetup/LUKS.\n2 HDDs with 512 MB /boot on /dev/md0 and 1,61 TB LUKS encrypted /dev/md1 with LVM containing /, swap, and others.\nI installed dropbear (and busybox was already installed) to unlock everything during the boot process. I use GRUB2.\nSo far everything works fine. I can login with a private key on dropbear listening on port 22 and unlock LUKS with the command\necho -n \"passphrase\" > /lib/cryptsetup/passfifo\n\nas soon as I do this, the server boots as if nothing is encrypted. Which is exactly what I want.\nNow, while this works fine, it's not how I want it to work.\nFirst off all, I can't find any documentation on /lib/cryptsetup/passfifo. How does it even work?\nSecond, I generated a Keyfile with GPG (also one with cryptsetup as a loop back device) that I want to use instead of a password. But I can't find any documentary on how to do this in busybox. GPG does not seem to be installed, so I can't use that key (can I somehow make GPG available to busybox?)\n \nSo at the moment, the only way for me to unlock my system is to pass my password to /lib/cryptsetup/passfifo which I don't want to use.\nI tried using cryptsetup directly in it's busybox path like\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md1 cryptdisk\n\nI did not show any errors, but my system did not proceed with the boot.\nAny ideas what I could do, or is there something wrong with my approach of handling this?\nFrank\n\nA: This is more a comment than an answer, sorry. But since you didn't get any replies yet, I wanted to write something anyway.\nAs for how does it even work:\nIn the Initramfs you usually have one master process (usually a busybox based /init shell script) which is responsible for making the root partition available before handing off the boot process to the real init system of your Ubuntu install.\nIn case of dropbear in Initramfs, that is a separate process started by /init. Logging into dropbear you get a shell which is yet another process. All the while the original /init has to be running and waiting for something, in this case the LUKS password.\nSo what the /init script most likely does here, once it started dropbear, is create a named pipe, or fifo, i.e. the /lib/cryptsetup/passfifo. And then it reads from that named pipe. This read will block until there actually is something to read, so that's how /init hangs and waits for input.\nThen some years later you log into dropbear and do your echo passphrase > /lib/cryptsetup/passfifo, at which point /init wakes up from its slumber and resumes to unlock LUKS and go on with the rest of the boot process.\nAnd that's basically the general idea of how it works. If there is no documentation for it you would have to read the shell script.\nAs for a GPG encrypted key in Initramfs, I'm sure this is the standard method in Ubuntu somehow, probably to be set up via /etc/crypttab. Did you check the wiki for a howto? \nIt certainly would require GPG to be included in the Initramfs. but I outlined an alternative approach here which could be made to work without additional dependencies:\nHow do I use dm-crypt (LUKS) with GnuPG to use two-factor for FDE?\nThe problem with this is of course that it is not standard, so while it could be simpler in theory it might actually be harder to set up.\n", "Q: Reinstall Ubuntu (With Windows 7) I successfully messed up Ubuntu. Now, I need to reinstall it. But Windows 7 is also installed on my computer, and it is the main OS.\nNow I booted up into the Ubuntu 13.04 installation DVD, and one of the options is to \"Reinstall Ubuntu 13.04\". I need to reinstall Ubuntu, but I don't want to lose my Windows 7 OS from the reinstallation. I just wanted to make sure and be clear that it is okay to reinstall Ubuntu*. Thanks!\n*That is: Ubuntu will be reinstalled in the right partition from its previous installation, and my Windows 7 OS will take no harm.\n\nA: If you want to really freshly install new Ubuntu why bother with such option, I usually just erasing my old Ubuntu partition and starting new partition and do fresh install again with dual boot as usual.

Two days ago I dropped my HP Windows 8 laptop. I got the error:\nBoot device not found. Please install an operating system on your hard disk. Hard disk (3f0).\n\nI couldn't access any files or the OS, so I went on my sister's computer, researched and learned about Ubuntu. I saved Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS to a disk and loaded it, but when I tried to install it, I had it connected to the power adaptor and the wifi, however there was not enough free space to install it. How do I view and delete files from the Try Ubuntu without installing mode?\nTLDR - Is there a way to delete previous files if I can't dual boot, using the \"uninstalled version\" of Ubuntu 12.04.3?\n\nA: If you cannot access your system and you want just access and manage the data of your hard disk, I think you can allways use the DVD \"try before install\", just delete the files on your hard disk, and then you can install it normally.\nTake a look at this for instructions: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/try-ubuntu-before-you-install\nI hope it help\n\nA: What you really need to do is mount your existing filesystem. Now how do you do that?\nSimple, really, the Unity launchbar which would be on your left hand side, would have an icon of a folder, that's where you can access everything from. I've attached a picture here, which can serve as a reference. Now under Devices, (look at the image), you'll have your existing data disks, for example in my screenshot, you can see Data Disk 1 &2. These are my Windows disks, when i click on them they get mounted and i can access all my data, while running my Ubuntu system. Delete whatever you'd like to and unmount the filesystem. Upon unmounting, Ubuntu would ask you if you'd like to delete all the items that you sent to trash, which when you agree to basically, clears all those items out for good, and it is necessary that you agree to clearing those items out. That way, you can create enough space for your Ubuntu installation. \n\n", "Q: How do I determine what is using the folder? I just can't delete the folder under root (it says that resource/device is busy), but lsof and fuser tell me nothing. The folder is located in the depth of /var/www/... and I tried to delete it after I stop apache2 and nginx.\n\nA: You can use:\nsudo lsof +D /var/www/dir_name \nOnce you know which processes have files open, you can exit those apps, or kill them with the kill command.\nIf you had a partition mounted to that point, you should  umount first. \n", "Q: Mouse wheel doesn't scroll in emacs 23.4.1 in Ubuntu 13.04 Scrolling with the mouse wheel doesn't work for me in emacs.

Changing the ownership fixes the scroll wheel problem. I'd call that permissions issue a bug. I'd vote up the answer but it's in a comment - thanks, Dan!\n", "Q: Is it possible to write protect a flash drive? I want to write protect and unprotect it to keep files from being formatted whenever people use it in a windows PC. I don't want people to delete my school work and I bring this to school and use it with a live CD of Lubuntu 12.04 in my moms laptop. People have got into my backpack while I went to the bathroom and plugged it into a PC (the flash drive had ex4 file format) and when it asked to format it they clicked yes assuming nothing will be deleted.\n\nA: I like your question!. But I dont think there is a direct way for it.\nI suggest a workaround.\nYou could create 2 partitions- the first one fat32 (for windows) and the second one ext2 (for you). As windows only recognises one partition per flash drive, it wont recognise your ext2 partition and hence wont format it.\nSo if anybody plugs in your Usb in windows your data wont be deleted.\nAlso I think ext2 or ext3 is better for flash drives rather than ext4.\nYou could create these two partitions using Gparted.\nHowever making more than 1 partition is not very well supported so use it with care and only when you need to.\nAnd as suggested, always make backups!\n\nA: There is no way to make an ordinary USB flash disk read only.\nThere are some 'tricks' but they are system and machine specific.\nIf you are worried about your data you could get USB with hardware encryption, but people will still be able to format it.\nJust keep it with you at all times if you can.\n\nA: My recommendation is to buy a flash drive designed for this purpose, no way to retrofit an existing flash drive.  Either a USB flash drive have a write protector switch or they don't. \nThere is also a product called the USB Write blocker. 1 end plugs into the computer and you plug your usb hard drive or USB memory stick into the other end.\nNow I found a script by xorangekiller, he claims that the script has been tested to work on Debian 6, Debian 7, Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 12.04, and Fedora 17.

While almost always correct, there are times when you would want a dependancy to remain, particularly when you are a developer or power user installing software that is not in the repository.\nIf you always install software through apt-get, without exception, and trust all the dependancies to be correct (which they usually are), then you can use apt-get autoremove and gain a small amount of drive space and a reduced exposure to potential security holes by having it remove packages that no longer have any packages that need them.\nBut if you install software manually, or develop software, or do not want to deal with a possible dependancy error, then not using autoremove to clear potentially unused packages is probably the safer choice. Regardless of whether you use apt-get autoremove every now and then or not, you will always remove software using apt-get remove Package\nFor example, if I install AwesomePackage, it may depend on AwesomeLibrary, and thus AwesomeLibrary will get automatically installed as a dependancy. When I remove AwesomePackage using autoremove, as long as no other package has AwesomeLibrary as a dependancy it will be uninstalled as well. But if SuperPackage also requires AwesomeLibrary, or if I had installed AwesomeLibrary explicitly myself rather than having it come in automatically as a dependancy (apt-get install AwesomeLibrary), then autoremove would not get rid of it.\nThe reason it is not the default is that having AwesomeLibrary on the system, unused, is a very minor issue. It will almost never cause problems, and most dependancies don't take up much space. There are exceptions, but the times when removing a dependancy will cause problems outnumber the times when it will solve or prevent a problem.\nSource: SuperUser: When would you use apt-get remove over apt-get autoremove?\n\nA: \nWhy not remove all packages that were installed by other packages and are no longer needed when the original package is removed?\n\nBecause, remove only remove the package that you want to remove, not it's dependencies. Let see:\nI installed xorg which depends (among other things) of xserver-xorg. xserver-xorg is marked as Automatic, and while I keep installed xorg it will not be uninstalled by autoremove. Now, I call apt-get remove xorg, which tells apt-get to do whatever it takes to remove xorg, and since it only needs to remove that package it doesn't take further action. Why? Because you only told him to remove that package and nothing else. You didn't tell him what to do with the dependencies, nor with other packages. apt-get is a good boy and follow your order with dot and comma, without trying to be smart doing things you didn't ask him to do, and I like it that way.\nWith apt-get autoremove xorg you tell apt-get to do whatever it takes to remove xorg and any Automatic dependency that was installed by xorg. Then apt-get follows your order and remove xorg and xserver-xorg and any other dependency of xorg that is marked as Automatic and don't have any other dependency to fulfill.\nLets take another scenario, I installed xorg and xserver-xorg and none is marked as Automatic. If I call remove on xorg only xorg will be deleted. If I call autoremove on xorg only xorg will be deleted. If I call remove on xserver-xorg, both xserver-xorg and xorg will get deleted, because you are telling apt-get to do whatever it takes to remove xserver-xorg but since xorg also depends of xserver-xorg, apt-get don't want to leave broken dependencies while following your orders, hence delete it.\nBut here is the fun, if you call autoremove on xserver-xorg it will uninstall any dependency marked as Automatic of xserver-xorg and xorg itself. Weird, huh? This is because apt-get takes this set of orders from you. In a nutshell, this are the actions, in the exact order, you tell apt-get whenever you call:\napt-get autoremove xserver-xorg\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove any reverse dependency of xserver-xorg. In this case xorg\n\n*Remove xserver-xorg.\n\n*Remove any package that xserver-xorg depends upon and is marked as automatic.\n\n*Don't do anything else.\n\n\napt-get remove xserver-xorg\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove any reverse dependency of xserver-xorg. In this case xorg\n\n*Remove xserver-xorg.\n\n*Don't do anything else.\n\n\napt-get remove xorg\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove any reverse dependency of xorg. In this case none\n\n*Remove xorg.\n\n*Don't do anything else.\n\n\napt-get autoremove xorg\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove any reverse dependency of xorg. In this case none\n\n*Remove xorg.\n\n*Remove any package that xorg depends upon and is marked as automatic. If xserver-xorg is marked as automatic, it will get removed. If it's not it will be kept installed.\n\n*Don't do anything else.\n\n\nAs you can see, every set of order has in the end \"Don't do anything else\" once he fulfilled every command. That is why you only remove only the target with remove.\n", "Q: Wireless not working on Toshiba Satellite C55-A5281 The wireless doesn't work on my Toshiba Satellite C55-A5281.

I have a Dell Studio 1555 laptop. I had Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit) installed onto it and it was the only OS. In Windows, my 250-GB hard disk was partitioned only into drive C (where Windows was installed) and drive D.\nRecently, I installed Ubuntu 13.04 via a pen drive; I performed a clean install. My aim was to be able to use Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.04 both as and when required wherein I expected to get a screen that asks me to choose between the two when I boot the laptop. I had done the same on my desktop and it worked fine.\nHowever, on my laptop, when I choose Windows 7 at the screen where I am supposed to choose between Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7, it doesn't boot up, saying \"Windows 7 cannot start because of some recent software or hardware changes\". They ask me to use the Windows installation disc and repair my computer. When I did that (using the installing Windows through USB method), there was no option to \"repair your computer\", which I think indicates that it doesn't detect the already installed Windows.\nI don't remember what exactly is it that I did wrong while installing Ubuntu but I remember NOT selecting \"overwrite\" or \"erase disk\", because I wanted my Windows data to remain intact. Also, I think I must have installed Ubuntu in the same drive as Windows (drive C) and that my \"home\", \"root\", \"bin\", \"boot\" are in the same drive because in Ubuntu the only device I see under \"Devices\" is \"Computer\" with all the aforementioned folders. \nUbuntu works just fine. However, I can't find my Windows data anywhere! Almost all the data was in drive D with only programs installed in C. I don't mind losing the application programs but my drive D contained some very important data.\nI searched the forums for a solution but for fear of making the problem completely irrepairable, I didn't try most of the stuff. I just need to access the data so that I can copy it onto my desktop and perform clean installations of Ubuntu and Windows 7 again.\nI don't know if this will help: paste.ubuntu.com/5794687\nThank you!\n\nA: Try to install \"gparted\" on Ubuntu-Software-Center, it at least let's you see the partition table like in Partition Magic on Windows.\nIt also offers some repair options for partitions and with great documentation on it's side, as it is a quite old Linux tool.\n;3)\nHad the same under XP...it was not working after resizing, deleting Linux for a cleaner install and repairing it like usual...had to reinstall it, maybe with gparted you'll be able to escape that fate.\n", "Q: Should I run 'ntpdate' regularly or should I use the NTP service? I think there are two solutions for keeping the time in sync on my machine. One is to run an NTP service, another is to run the ntpdate regularly by putting it in a crontab.\nThis is how I understand it - is it correct? if yes, which solution is better?\n\nA: About ntpdate:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should be used to sync the time at that moment only. It will leave the time alone after it has been run.\n\n*Limits to one remote peer to sync with.\n\n*Does not account for skew caused by your system clock.\n\n\nAbout the ntp (service):\n\n\n*\n\n*Checks multiple remote peers.\n\n*Ability to check for remote peers that provide wrong time. They will be ignored. Run ntpq -p to list the remote peers and the \"score\" (+, -, *) ntp gives it.\n\n*Will keep track of the time of the machine and adjusts time by very small increments to compensate for skew caused by your system clock.\n\n*Does not apply a large offset. If your system clock is off for a few hours, ntp won't touch it. See Unable to synchronize time using NTP\nConclusion: Use ntpdate the first time you use the system (done by the Ubuntu installer if you're connected to the internet), then configure ntp correctly and it should keep your clock in sync. That is the best option in my opinion.\n\nA: The best solution is to run ntpd or ntpclient.  Both of these will continually adjust your clock to keep it in sync.  My clocks are typically withing a few milliseconds of their best time source.  Overhead is quite low and once synchronization is achieved, there is is only one query every 1024 seconds (or longer).  With a GPS or radio source they can be used even when disconnected from the Internet.  \nntpdate can be used to perform first time synchronization, although newer versions of the daemons will do this step too.   ntpdate is useful for debugging access to time servers, and discovering time sources.   I use it to verify if my router or DNS servers provide a good time source.  \nWhen I need two or more servers to have synchronized clocks, I use ntpd and peer the servers.  Even when disconnected, you can enable use of the local clock on one or three servers and let them choose the best time source.  \nThe daemons can provide good logs to verify the quality of the time sources and how well you have been synchronized.  If you fudge the stratum of the hardware clock you can provide a backup time source, and log how well it tracks reality. \n\nA: I agree with above answers, but it is overkill in most circumstances to have the average user or server box running a full NTP server/service/daemon. And why install extra system software? If it's good enough for the Ubuntu system to set system time (see next paragraph) being brought up, it's fine for most syncs needed by the avg user.\nUnless your system clock is constantly off (like some of my machines) or you need very precise time-keeping round-the-clock, a sync is done each time the network interface is brought up ( see: /etc/network/if-up.d/ntpdate ). \nIf you do need system clock updates occasionally, but do not want to run a full NTPd service, there is nothing wrong with using ntpdate to update your system when you like.\nI do this via cron. You may wish to do a root crontab or crond hourly (or daily) using ntpdate:\nsudo nano /etc/cron.hourly/synctime\nNote: The filename of the script called by run-parts should have NO extension or odd characters. Your script will not get picked up if this is the case. I choose the single lowercase name above (\"synctime\" - no extension).\nThen add this to that script:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/sbin/ntpdate -s 192.168.1.1  # < local or remote (name or IP) for NTP server here\n\nSave. Then make executable:\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/cron.hourly/synctime\n\nEvery hour ntpdate will sync to server of your choice. (Default cron.hourly time on mine is processed ~17 minutes after the hour)\n..in addition to the system default sync done when interface comes up (usually when system comes up after a reboot).\nI personally run the ntpd server on my main Ubuntu server (stays sync'd from accurate ntp server pools on Internet) - which in turn feeds all of my LAN machines via ntpdate as per above - as the client. This way my LAN is synchronized from one local point using Ubuntu's default ntpdate utility.\n\n", "Q: apt-get install -f seems to purge too much I've been trying to install skype to the 12.04 64bit.\nInstalling ai32-libs doesnt work at all (something about held packages and none of recommendations hasn't helped).\nI've installed package somehow (dpkg probably), but it still doesnt work.

I have an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS VirtualBox guest running on a Windows 7 host.  Until recently it had been working flawlessly1.\nSince a few days ago, however, web browsing in this Ubuntu VBox has been extremely slow (so much so that many pages never finish loading).  This sluggishness is confined to the Ubuntu VBox; I experience no slowdown at all in the Windows host.  (This rules out server-side problems and problems with the internet connection.)\nI have reason to believe that the problem has to do with the Ubuntu VBox's DNS resolution, because the sluggishness started right after I had to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf.  I posted a question about this at that time.\nThat said, I can't figure out what I could have broken by doing this, since, besides answering 'Yes' in the dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf dialog (described in that earlier question), I did not make any other changes to my DNS resolution configuration.\nIn any case, it was after doing this sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf and rebooting the Ubuntu VBox, that I noticed that web browsing had become, on average, very slow.\nA typical experience is that, using Firefox (for example) I do a Google search (which is usually reasonably quick2), then I click on any one of the top hits, and then the looong wait begins.  This wait is long enough that, before it's over, I have time to switch to the Windows 7 host, repeat the same Google search (using Firefox again), click on the same hit that I'd just clicked while in the Ubuntu guest, instantly retrieve the desired, read whatever I needed to read, and switch back to the Ubuntu guest.  (If nothing else, this confirms that whatever the problem is, it is confined to the current configuration of the Ubuntu guest.)\n\nHow can I troubleshoot this problem further (and hopefully fix it)?\n\n\n1 As an aside, let me express my admiration for VirtualBox.  Wow, what an impressive piece of software!\n2 Interestingly, the first few Google searches I did after reconfiguring resolvconf and rebooting were slow-as-molasses, but eventually they got faster.  My guess is that (consistent with my suspicions of the current DNS setup) this observed speed-up is due to caching of some key IP addresses.\n\nA: OK, I found an (excellent) answer to my question, here.\nIt turns out that the only non-comment line in my /etc/resolv.conf file was\nnameserver 127.0.0.1 \n\n...which coincides with the situation presented in that other thread.\nIn my case, the problem was resolved by performing only the first adjustment suggested in that answer, namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*run gksudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf;\n\n*comment out the dns=dnsmasq (→ # dns=dnsmasq);\n\n*run sudo service network-manager restart.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Installation Alongside Windows I am new to Ubuntu and I have  recently burned an Ubuntu .iso file on to a DVD and booted in to Ubuntu. \nMy disk is 80GiB and it is already partitioned in 2 parts. C: where the Windows is installed, this is 65GiB, and the second partition is 15GiB.\nI want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 and preferably in the second partition (15gb).\nWhich option should I choose? \"Install alongside Windows.\" or The Manual install or something else?\n\nA: You should choose something else.\nThe along side option, creates space from C: drive and install it there. If you try to do so now, it will take space from 64gb partition. Not the 15GB.\nAfter choosing something else, do the following,\n\n\n*\n\n*In the window, identify the 15gb partition. it should be marked as sda2\n\n*Select it in the list, click on Delete. \n\n*Then, click on New, select file system as SWAP from the dropdown list, (partition type logical or primary doesn't matter as 4 primary partition can be there)  give size around 1GB/2GB as swap space. If you have 1GB ram, I suggest 2GB as swap space. Click OK\n\n*Now, click on the remaining space (13GB), select file system as  ext4 , mounting point / (root symbol). Click ok\n\n*Make sure booloader location is pointing to your correct disk sda\n\n*Now proceed with installation.\n\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How to create a button event on Ubuntu SDK I've downloaded the Ubuntu SDK to create apps in my spare time, and I've started converting a console app of a binary converter I made to one with a GUI. So I've dropped the edits, buttons and what not but for my one button that converts I don't know how to make the event. I've tried double clicking (which works in so many other rad environments) but in this it just goes to change the properties of the button. I've looked around on the menus and drop downs but can't find anything. All help is appreciated, thank you.\nPS: This is in fact a desktop application not a mobile one.\n\nA: I do not know how to do it via the GUI, but if you go to edit mode, and go to the button, you can change the onClicked event.\nButton {\n    iconSource: \"icon.png\"\n    text: \"Icon on left\"\n    iconPosition: \"left\"\n    onClicked: print(\"clicked text and icon Button\")\n}\n\nYou can find more information here: http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/devel/ubuntu-13.10/qml/ui-toolkit/qml-ubuntu-components0-button.html\n", "Q: Files saved with Ubuntu is not visible in Windows 8 I have dual booted my laptop with ubuntu 12.10 and windows 8. When I download some file via ubuntu (e.g a pdf) and save it on a windows partition(NTFS), I do not see it through windows 8. Even when I set to view hidden files, the files do not appear. But when I boot with Ubuntu I see the file is there.\nWhat is the issue here. This is not a very good experience for me. Please let me know how to fix the issue.\n\nA: Well, under Windows 8, have you made all files visible? Hidden files?\nIt may also be due bad handling on the Linux side or bad interpretation of Win 8, so safer would be to use FAT32, like on USB-sticks as Linux is handling that perfectly and more easy than the different versions of NTFS.\nHope my limited software knowledge of Linux, but a bit better under Windows is worth something for you...\n;3)\n", "Q: Why there are many guest accounts on my system? After I saw this answer, I realized that there are many guest accounts on my system:\ngrep guest /etc/passwd\nguest-jzXeRx:x:117:127:Guest,,,:/tmp/guest-jzXeRx:/bin/false\nguest-l5dAPU:x:118:128:Guest,,,:/tmp/guest-l5dAPU:/bin/false\nguest-FdSAkw:x:119:129:Guest,,,:/tmp/guest-FdSAkw:/bin/false\nguest-eBU0cU:x:121:131:Guest,,,:/tmp/guest-eBU0cU:/bin/false\n\nMoreover, in this moment there is nobody logged as guest, but if somebody will login as guest, a new guest account is created - why, since there are already other guest accounts? After the new guest will log out, his account will be deleted. But why the other guest accounts remain? For what use/purpose?\nIt doesn't mind me at all this guest account, but I want to know if it is okay to delete them manually.\n\nA: I'm putting in my two cents.  It's normal to see that.\nIn Ubuntu 1000 + User ID (uid) are allowed for Normal user and below 1000(uid) are assigned to system application and daemons.  Plus guest accounts are removed periodically.  So if you want to check completely how many user are on you system, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\ncat /etc/passwd | grep /home\n\nEdit\nFor me guest accounts are removed periodically (I logged in as guest more than 10 times, but none stayed very long in /etc/passwd). You might want to try it yourself.\nNow, Ubuntu's Guest account is a special type of account, which has its home directory set to the mount point of a tmpfs filesystem, which is used to store data which gets lost after a reboot.\nThe data in tmpfs is stored in RAM, which uses the swap space as a fall back, so it is likely the data has never been written to disk in the first  place, so there's basically nothing to recover.\nSince tmpfs is temporary storage. It is intended to appear as a mounted file system, but stored in volatile memory instead of a persistent storage device.  Everything stored in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be created on the hard drive; however, on reboot, everything in tmpfs will be lost.\n\nA: The guest-XXXXXX entries in /etc/passwd and /etc/group are normally removed when you log out from a guest session. Maybe you have somehow rebooted a few times without logging out first.\nYou can safely delete the entries. If you do it like this:\nsudo deluser guest-jzXeRx\n\nfor respective guest username, both /etc/passwd and /etc/group will be cleaned up.\n\nA: As you know that every time a guest session starting by a user , a temporary user will be created with limited privileges and when he ends the session the data will be erased about his session. \nbut next time if any other user trying to do guest session means again a new guest session have to create with new guest ID.\nso Ubuntu setting all the created guest id's to false , so that when you set a users shell to /usr/bin/false, they will not be able log in with older guest ID's and new Id have to create everytime.In your question we have many guest users  guest-jzXeRx ,guest-l5dAPU ,guest-FdSAkw ,guest-eBU0cU. these are the  guest ID's and with those you will not be able to login next time.\nhope that helps my friend. \n\nA: To remove all guest accounts:\nfor line in $(grep -o 'guest-......'  /etc/passwd | sort -u); do sudo deluser $line; done\n\nSample output:\nRemoving user `guest-2LGMce' ...\nWarning: group `guest-2LGMce' has no more members.\nDone.\nRemoving user `guest-5T4CBr' ...\nWarning: group `guest-5T4CBr' has no more members.\nDone.\nRemoving user `guest-8eZELT' ...\nWarning: group `guest-8eZELT' has no more members.\nDone.\n\n", "Q: no application switcher in fullscreen?

to be Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 LTS. That's over five years old. Despite its age, official support only ended in May 2013 but it's never going to get security updates any longer and that's a problem.\nThe versions listed above were published in 2010 and that should highlight the urgency of the task at hand. This server is probably vulnerable to multiple remote exploits.\nYou could attempt in-place distribution upgrades to 12.04 (which is supported until 2017) but this means service interruption immediately and could mean things break. It could also take a couple of iterations to get to 12.04. It's just a messy idea.\nI'd start afresh. New server, new Ubuntu install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup just in case it does just explode but otherwise leave the old server as it is. Whoever is currently using this server will not appreciate any downtime so leaving the old one up is your route to happy co-workers and a happy boss.\n\n*Install Ubuntu 12.04 (or whatever the latest LTS is at the time of reading) on a new server (or virtual machine, however you've got things set up). If this is one of many servers at the company, it might be worth looking at hardware consolidation/redundancy techniques that virtualisation works well with.\n\n*Build a list of things you need to get working from the old server. What websites are there running on it? What services do people depend on it providing? What IPs does it use? Can the IP be changed? How? Where? Who will that disrupt?\nBy the end of this stage you should have a document telling you what you need to do.\n\n*Install the packages from #3 but don't simply copy forward old configuration.\nIt's really tempting to port /etc/ over from the old server but I've done similar things with PHP before and it set me back days. Use your observations from #3 and from playing around with the old server to build new a new configuration based on modern best practices.\n\n*Copy your websites and databases over.\n\n*Test and fix. I've no idea how long this will take because I've never upgraded a Tomcat website before but at the very least you need to make sure it still does everything it's supposed to.\n\n*When you're happy it works, you'll need to copy over the data again from the old server (assuming people have been using it in the meantime).\n\n*Unplug the old server and toss it into the sea. Or repurpose it. It's probably ancient and inefficient so it might not be a bad idea to \nAs Brendan mentions in the comments, you should be generating a ton of documentation between steps 3 and 6. If you just keep writing down what you're doing and why as you do things, it'll take you 30 minutes longer but it'll leave you with a solid plan for next time. When you're done, there may have been unneccessary steps you can skip next time so make sure you add a conclusion.\nI would also be tempted to drop the previous owner and their boss a note about the state of the server and how dangerously negligent lapsed security updates are. You can do this without sounding like an interfering tool but that's optional.\n", "Q: Is there a multiboot iso creator for ubuntu? I want to create a multi boot CD in windows I do this with xboot but is there any program to create multi boot ISO in Ubuntu\n\nA: How to create an Ubuntu All-in-one Live DVD uses grub4dos\nhttp://prshah.blogspot.com/2009/10/how-to-create-ubuntu-all-in-one-dvd.html\nSimilar,but your grub configuration must match ISO you want to boot\nDVD with both 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu\n\nA: Creating a multiboot CD. you're limited to 1 ISO because of space, but you can create a multiboot USB, using Yumi.  Once you choose the first ISO, and its created, it will prompt you if you want to add another ISO.\n\nI don't think that this program will allow you to create a multiboot DVD, but you can use MagicISO.  MagicISO has ability to create multiboot DVD image file so that the user can incorporate multiple installation CD or ISO into one DVD, and install multiple Operation System from one DVD.\n", "Q: How to set a socks proxy server only for one user? in Ubuntu 13.04 I tried to insert\nexport socks_proxy=socks://address:port\n\ninto ~/.profile but this is not working.\nPS: I need to set it only for a user so not in /etc/enviroment.\n\nA: A few points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Environment variables are case-sensitive. Environment variables like this tend to be uppercase.\n\n*If you're testing in bash, note the top of the ~/.profile file:\n# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.\n# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login\n# exists.\n# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.\n# the files are located in the bash-doc package.\n\n\n*The help wiki recommends using ~/.pam_environment instead of other files for session environment variables.\n\n*Its syntax is different than what you're expecting. See: http://linux.die.net/man/5/pam_env.conf\n\n*So (assuming ~/.pam_environment) you're probably looking for:\nSOCKS_PROXY DEFAULT=socks://address:port\n\nOtherwise this is probably just a case issue.\n\nYou mention that you're using a browser and in there may lie the actual issue. Firefox, ignores environment variables by default. There is a plugin that will look for environment variables though (it's quite old):\n\n\n*\n\n*https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/environment-proxy/\nI'm not sure how other browsers handle these things but I wouldn't be surprised if they do also ignore them.\n", "Q: Where is the file I saved on my USB flash drive? I am running Ubuntu from a pendrive and I saved a document in LibreOffice. My computer shut down and now I can't find it anywhere!\nI've read that if running Ubuntu from pendrive it saves documents onto the USB flash drive, but they can't be seen while actually running Ubuntu from USB. So how can I find my saved  document?\nAlso, is there a way to virtual mount the Ubuntu ISO from the USB to the computer? I tried to install, but I don't have enough memory on my hard disk - only 3GB.\nI'm just a new user, so please help me in the most basic, step-by-step way if you can. Thank you so much in advance!\n\nA: When creating a Ubuntu pendrive changes will not be saved across reboots unless you have enabled persistence. My guess is that you did not set any persistence for your pendrive any therefore any changes you make or files you saved will not be saved. There are a couple ways to check but the easiest is to boot to the USB, make some changes(change your background and make a couple files), then reboot and see if the changes are there.\nI bet you will find they are not. So remake you pendrive, but this time with persistence.\nA simple way to do this is using UNetBootin. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download UNetBootin\n\n*Select Ubuntu as the distribution and I would go with either 12.04 or 13.04 as the version\n\n*Set the persistence to 4000MB. \nnote: The max is 4GB, there are ways to overcome if you want to do some research.\n\n*Make sure your USB drive is selected and hit OK\nNow you can save changes and files across reboots.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.

PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!\n\n\nIn order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current\npassword for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and\nyou haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,\nso you should just press enter here.\n\nEnter current password for root (enter for none):\nERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)\nEnter current password for root (enter for none):\nERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)\nEnter current password for root (enter for none):\n\n\nA: I had the exact same issue and it turned out to be a lack of memory issue. Running this script on the host fixed it for me:\n#!/bin/bash    \ncid=104\nvzctl set ${cid} --vmguarpages 1024M --save\nvzctl set ${cid} --oomguarpages 1024M --save\nvzctl set ${cid} --privvmpages 1024M:1024M --save\n\nFeel free to change 1024 to whatever amount of memory you want your container to have. You will also need to change 104 to the ID of your container.\n\nA: Use the command below to change the root password for mysql server\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5\n\n\nA: First of all check if you the mysql server is actually rolling. As root run:\nservice mysql restart\n\nIf no errors occur continue reading otherwise reinstall the mysql server with apt-get install --reinstall mysql-server.\nNext check the mysql configuration file /etc/mysql/my.cnf and look for the following parameters:\nuser = mysql\n...\nbind-address = 127.0.0.1\n\nChange them if needed are reboot the server, then try to connect with one of the following:\nmysql -u root\nmysql -u root -p\nmysql -u root -p -h localhost\nmysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1\n\nIf you can't still login try to alter the /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld like so:\nSearch for\n/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid w,\n/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock w,\n\nReplace with\n/{,var/}run/mysqld/mysqld.pid w,\n/{,var/}run/mysqld/mysqld.sock w,\n\nRestart the apparmor service with service apparmor restart and retry to connect to mysql. If still no luck, stop the mysql server and rerun it without grant tables:\nsudo service mysql stop\nsudo mysqld --skip-grant-tables &\n\nNow you should be able to login to mysql without password (mysql -u root). Have a look what is going on your user table:\nselect Host, User, Password from mysql.user;\n\nYou should have 4 root users, check that the hostname is correct and that all have a password. Try to reset the password with a new one:\nupdate mysql.user set Password=PASSWORD('YOUR-PASSWORD');\nflush privileges;\nexit;\n\nNow sudo killall mysqld and sudo service mysql restart and retry to connect with the new credentials.\n\nA: I can't explain why this is happening, but a workaround to set MySQL's root password after the failed attempt in order to possibly make sudo mysql_secure_installation run is to run this command:\nmysqladmin -u root -p '' password '<new_password>'\n\n*<new_password> = new password \n", "Q: How to install windows 7/8 inside Ubuntu?

And if there is how do I install?\n\nA: It looks like you need to use the curses.h file instead.  See here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8792317/why-cant-i-find-conio-h-on-linux\n\nA: You may look at https://github.com/pushkar6723/conio4gcc\nNote that this is only compatible file. I recommend to shift on curses.h file, which has lot many things, which are absent in conio.h file.\n\nA: the best way, is create a symlink between curses.h and conio.h like:\nln -s /usr/include/curses.h /usr/include/conio.h\n\nthen you can use\n#include <curses.h>\nor \n#include <conio.h>\n\nif you don't have curses.h\n# debian/ubuntu\n$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev\n# voidlinux\n$ xbps-install -S ncurses-devel\n# archlinux\n$ pacman -Sy ncurses\n# redhate/fedora/suse...\n$ sudo yum install ncurses-devel\n\n\nA: Here is a possible solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*From https://sourceforge.net/projects/hlanguage/files/Source/include/conio.h/download download the 1.1 KB conio.h file\n\n*Save or copy the file to the directory /usr/include\n\n*Then from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hlanguage/files/Source/include/_mingw.h/download download the 3.8KB _mingw.h file which conio.h depends on.\n\n*Save the _mingw.h file to the same location as the conio.h file.\n\n\nDo not dump these files to your present project directory, they will not work. Besides these are general compiler libraries that you may need to compile other projects, so better to make them available to the compiler and not the project. \nI am using an Android handheld, if you are on PC please revise this response with wget and precise download links.\n", "Q: purple screen boot 12.04 (black with recovery mode) So I have a problem with my asus computer:\neverything went just fine until today, \nmy computer shows me the grub menu when I start up like it usually does.\nBut when I choose a version of linux the only thing I get is a  purple screen or a black one if I use the recovery mode.\nI have been using ubuntu 12.04 for about a month and I did not download a single update the day before it started to act like this.

I'm just wondering Does Ubuntu sell the tablets or can I buy one with the right requirements and put Ubuntu on to it as the new operating system??\n\nA: At present Ubuntu Touch is not sold with any tablets, but Canonical provides flashable images for use on specific devices. You can flash Ubuntu Touch onto the Nexus 7 and 10, or you may be able to compile it for other devices. Please look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices for the list.\nThe short summary - for now, the officially supported device images available from Canonical are the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4 phones, and Nexus 7 and 10 tablets, but you'll have to flash it yourself, after backing up your data and unlocking/rooting your device.

Sometimes (like 10 times a day) my ubuntu completely freezes (mouse stop working, the sound who whas playing start a annoying loop \"repeating like the last 0.2 seconds\") and the only thing im able to do is mannualy restart via the reset button on cpu case. What should i do? is there some system log where i can find the reason? thx and sorry my bad english\n\nA: You can take a look at systems logs located on /var/log/, mainly /var/log/syslog or /var/log/kern.log.\nThis is likely a fault in some hardware component or in some Linux driver module. If that's the case, you should find more information there. \nThere's a chance that you will only see the driver name, and you have to figure out what device corresponds to. Also, as your system is crashing badly, the logs might not be written on the hard disk on time, so maybe you will find nothing.\nAs this is happening frequently, just leave a terminal opened with the output from this command visible:\nsudo tail -f /var/log/syslog\n\nYou will probably spot the problem that way.\nWhen I have this kind of problems on desktops I always blame the wifi/networking devices, then the USB devices, then the graphical card, in that order. Then I freak out and run in circles. \nIf you suspect from some device, e.g. the computer always crashes when downloading a big file, or when playing a video, or when writing on a USB device, you can also try to not using it for a while and see if the system goes more stable. Once you've found the culprit, you can start trying to fix the problem.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu 13.04 as only os but windows still there (Asus UX32A)?

And to properly install Ubuntu (At its best) it is kind of important.\nHow to know if CPU is 32bit ou 64bit Click here\nHow to know if your BIOS is EFI or LEGACY :\nYou will have to access your BIOS again and look for EFI (or UEFI), if you can't find it; there are good chances that your BIOS is LEGACY (But I doubt it with Windows 8).\n(Personally in my BIOS, it's in the BOOT options).\n(There are chances that your booting troubles are because of EFI, did you use an  Ubuntu ISO 32Bits ?)\nFor more info about that Click here.\nIf your CPU is 64Bits, download an Ubuntu ISO 64.\nIf your CPU is 32Bits, download an Ubuntu ISO 32.\nIf your BIOS is EFI (or UEFI), and your CPU a 32Bit (Should not happen I guess), change EFI in your BIOS for LEGACY and download an Ubuntu ISO 32.

If you don't want this, use:\nls -d !(*.*)\n\nYou can put shopt -s extglob in your ~/.bashrc to have it activated whenever you open a terminal. There is already a line in the default Ubuntu ~/.bashrc (line 29 for me on 13.04) that you can uncomment to enable this (and globstar).\nSee Greg's wiki for more information on the shell's various globbing options. Note that this is a property of the bash shell rather than the ls command, so you can use it with other commands.\nAlternatively, you can use\nls --ignore='*.*'\n\nor\nls -I '*.*'\n\n...which is an internal ls option, but extglob can be applied to any arbitrary command & so is more useful in my opinion.\n\nA: Both ls | grep -v \\\\. and ls | grep -v  \"\\.\" works.\n", "Q: What are Click packages? I noticed that Ubuntu SDK recently had some updates and it installed a program named \"Click\". I would like to know what they are and how to use them.\nAlso, would they make Debian packaging easier?\n\nA: Click packages are the new packaging format used in Ubuntu Touch, and by Ubuntu 14.10, on the desktop version of Ubuntu as well.\nSome of the features they provide are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simplified packaging for the developer. The Ubuntu SDK can automatically create Click packages of your Ubuntu Touch apps. If you want to create your own, the format is very simple, consisting of two files, manifest.json and <app-name>.json.\nThe manifiest.json file is the actual package definition and looks like this:\n{\n    \"description\": \"Your tasks, every device, everywhere. Create and synchronize tasks using Ubuntu One, and connect to your boards in Trello.\",\n    \"framework\": \"ubuntu-sdk-13.10\",\n    \"hooks\": {\n        \"ubuntu-tasks\": {\n            \"apparmor\": \"ubuntu-tasks.json\",\n            \"desktop\": \"ubuntu-tasks.desktop\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"maintainer\": \"Michael Spencer <sonrisesoftware@gmail.com>\",\n    \"name\": \"com.ubuntu.developer.mdspencer.ubuntu-tasks\",\n    \"title\": \"Ubuntu Tasks\",\n    \"version\": \"0.5\"\n}\n\nThe <app.name>.json file is the security profile for your app and looks like this:\n{\n    \"policy_groups\": [\n        \"networking\"\n    ],\n    \"policy_version\": 1\n}\n\nTo build your package, you can either use the Ubuntu SDK or by running\nclick build .\n\nYou can find more information about packaging your app here.\n\n*The ability to run under confinement. What this means is that the app is prevented from doing bad things. It can only access its own private directory and access features that the user allows the app to use. This means that Click packages are very safe and the review process for publishing them is much simpler.\nOnce you've packaged your app, you can submit your application to the Click App Store. The review process is vary simple and will be completed usually within a few hours. Once reviewed, your app will be available for installation from any device running Ubuntu Touch.\nWould they make Debian packaging easier? \nYes and no. Debian packaging is completely different. However, if your app is made with the Ubuntu SDK, you don't need to use Debian packaging and can instead use Click packaging, which is much easier to use and much safer for the end user.\nHere are some useful links for more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is my Ubuntu Touch app not visible in the Ubuntu Software Center?\n\n*Where do I submit applications written for Ubuntu Touch?\n\n*What is the naming convention for click packages?\n\n*The official documentation for Click packages\n", "Q: Why is the back arrow on Nautilus so small?

Could not compile although I had installed the necessary packages. The problem seems to be, that scid looks inside /usr/lib for the tcl and tk libs, although they are installed in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu as you can see by right-clicking in the package manager on the tcl8.5-lib package and selecting Properties/Installed Files.\nThe solution is to create soft links to those libraries in the /usr/lib dir:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcl8.5.so.0 /usr/lib/libtcl8.5.so.0\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtk8.5.so.0 /usr/lib/libtk8.5.so.0\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: In my case modifying the configure script worked.

Ctrl+H shows hidden folders.\nIt is best to make sure you're not running any chrome or chromium-browser processes though, before manually deleting that file. You can use the System Monitor for this, or the ps and killall commands. (Actually there are other ways too, but those ways are covered below.)\nFirst make sure Google Chrome is not actually running anymore.\nYou can use the System Monitor for this. Press the Super key (i.e., the Windows key) and type system monitor. The System Monitor should come up as a search result. Click on it. It works pretty intuitively; it's similar to the Task Manager in Windows.\nGo to the Processes tab in the System Monitor. Right-click on any chrome or chromium-browser processes you find, and click End Process. If that doesn't get rid of them, use Kill Process (which is right under End Process).\n\nIf you find it in the System Monitor but are unable to quit it from there, or if you just prefer using a command-line, you can use the ps and killall commands as described below. One advantage of this way is that you can easily copy all the text from the Terminal and put it into your question (or a comment if it's very short), if you need help.\nForcing Chrome to quit, from the command-line.\nIf you've already used the System Monitor method described above, and either no chrome or chromium-browser processes were running or you were able to quit all of them, then skip this section.\nOpen a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nps x | grep [c]hrom\n\nThat should show if Google Chrome (or Chromium) is running. Processes called google-chrome are Google Chrome; processes called chromium-browser are Chromium. Either could be accessing the lock file and preventing new instances of Google Chrome from launching properly.\nYou might see nothing at all. If you see nothing, then Google Chrome is not running. (At least not as your user account. ps ax would show processes for all user accounts ...but that should not be necessary.)\nIf Chrome is running, you might see something like this (possibly with more lines--sometimes with many more):\nek@Kip:~$ ps x | grep chrom\n26563 ?        Sl     0:06 /opt/google/chrome/chrome\n\nIf any Chrome or Chromium processes are running, but there are no windows for them, then they're probably frozen. One good way to terminate them is by running this for Google Chrome:\nkillall chrome\nkillall -KILL chrome\n\n(Use chromium-browser to kill Chromium.)\nIf you run the first command, then wait a couple seconds before the second command, Chrome might have a chance to unload somewhat cleanly.\nIf the first command succeeded, then when you run the second command you should see:\nchrome: no process found\n\nIf you don't see that, run the second command again. If you still don't see it, then run:\nsudo killall -KILL chrome\n\n(This is okay so long as no other users are logged in and running Chrome. If they are, their instances of Chrome will be killed too.)\nIf you run that a couple times and still don't get a no process found message, then Chrome is probably caught in uninterruptible sleep. The best generally effective way to deal with that is to reboot your computer.\nIf this still happens when Google Chrome is not running...\n...then it's time to follow the instructions it gave, and delete the lock file.\nGiven your description, this is actually likely. But it's good to make sure Chrome isn't actually running first (hence the section above).\nThe file to delete is:\n/home/brandon/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock\n\nYou said you couldn't find the folder it's in. Most likely, you were unable to find it because the .config subfolder of your home directory (/home/brandon) is hidden. Files and folders whose names start with a . are hidden by default.\nIf you want to delete the file in Nautilus (the file browser), you can press Ctrl+H or click View > Show Hidden Files. This shows entries that start with a . (and any other files configured to be hidden; usually there are no others).\nThen you can navigate into the .config folder, into the google-chrome subfolder, and delete the SingletonLock file.\nAlternatively, you an delete the file from the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) with a single command:\nrm /home/brandon/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock\n\nDo not use the -r or -R flag for this command. It's unnecessary, and if you typed the name of the file wrong, then it could delete lots of stuff you don't want deleted. (If you typed everything else correctly, it would be fine. But there is no advantage.)\nThat should fix the problem. If it does not, make sure the file was actually deleted and (if not) check its permissions. This one command will do both, and you can edit your question to include all the text in the Terminal from running it:\nls -l /home/brandon/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock\n\n(-l is a lower-case -L, not a numeral -1 or an upper-case -I.)\n", "Q: wine: vboxvideo_dri.so: wrong ELF class I'm trying to run a game under wine.

This is on purpose to make it harder to mess things up.\nThe best places to install the android SDK would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/local/android-sdk/  - under your home folder, won't require special permissions\n\n*/usr/local/share/android-sdk/  - anywhere under /usr/local/ would be okay\n\n*/opt/android-sdk/  - fairly standard location for big standalone software like the android SDK\n\n\nWhat I usually do is make sure my user is a member of the 'adm' group, then make sure that /usr/local and /opt are owned by that group and are set with group-write permissions, then install things there.  That will allow you to make changes inside of those without having to use sudo.\nThe purposes of the various directories can be found in the Linux File Hierarchy Standard:\nhttp://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html\n\nA: To locate specific packages (software) open the terminal with Ctrl + Alt + Delete and type the following command: locate [packagename] where packagename is the exact name of your package.\nYou could also manually look for your software in /usr/share/ or /usr/lib/\nBut if you want a location for the Android SDK directory I would highly recommend you put it in your Home directory since you do not have full privileges in the /usr/ directory by default.\n", "Q: Forwarding traffic between 2 interfaces I have 2 VLANs connected to a 'router'.

I plan to switch from Windows to Ubuntu in the next few weeks. \nI currently have a Radeon HD6970 in my system, that I'll be changing during this process too (since it is loud and I can't make much use of it under Ubuntu, considering that many of the more demanding games I play aren't available anyways). Thus I'm looking for a card that is both passively cooled (so it'll be silent) and that will play nicely with Ubuntu.\nIt seems that currently the \"fastest\" passive/fanless Cards are the Nvidia GeForce GT 640 and the AMD/ATI Radeon HD7750. Both have similar prices (around €100). \nOriginally I was going to opt for the Nvidia one, considering how everyone seems to claim that Nvidia has the better drivers, plus, with my multi-monitor setup the driver in the live cd (12.04) for the HD6970 seems to be crashing when I change the display setting (this is probably fixable, but I haven't really had much reason to really look into it). But then I read around here and on other pages that while Nvidia has the better (as in better-performing; closed-source) drivers, AMD has better (as in better compatibility; open-source) drivers that are updated/patched more often. \nSo I'm not really sure which one to pick. While I don't really care about the performance difference, I also can't really verify the better compatibility of the AMD cards. I've always had AMD/ATI cards up to now, and tried Ubuntu on/off a few times .. and the graphics cards have always been a hairy detail (especially since I have a 2-monitor setup)\nAny suggestions/ideas on which I should pick? Or is it even worth trying both cards? Like I said, the deciding factor here is which one will cause me less headaches. (Since performance-wise both cards are probably fine.)\n\nA: This is a really diverse topic, but I would go with the AMD card, because I had a better experience with AMD graphics cards when setting up multi-monitor setups using Ubuntu. But this can probably be different for you.\nWhat's really good about AMD is the open source driver as you noted. The Linux kernel 3.11 features a new version of the AMD open source driver, which makes it really usable. I have it running for a week now and all my problems with linux graphics have disappeared. Unfortunately the 3.11 kernel is only available in Ubuntu 13.10 which is currently only available as a daily. In my experience it is really stable, but if you want to stay with the stable release, you probably have to wait until October to get the new open source driver. Before the new version I would strongly recommend the closed source driver.\n", "Q: How to mount floppy drive in Ubuntu 13.04?

Ever. \n\n*You can remove Windows and install Ubuntu. You can also install Ubuntu alongside Windows, alas with a little hassle. You can also run Ubuntu from a CD or USB stick. This is not convenient for everyday use, but can give you a feel of the system, plus if something goes wrong the results aren't saved - just reboot. Just choose one and post a question how to do it. Note that this question will have already been asked on the site.\n\n*The others said about the terminal commands. cmd.exe has 30-ish built-ins. The linux interpreter in Ubuntu has about 2700 when fresh, and more as you install programs. Just go step by step. Learn to do your daily task under Ubuntu, then learn how to do them more conveniently with smarter commands, the process never ends.\n", "Q: Asus motherboard - which graphics-drivers? I've recently purchased an old but working mobo, Asus p5s800-vm/s. The onboard graphics are displaying low-res \"safety mode\" type graphics on the monitor.\nI understand from the guy I bought it from that it will need extra drivers to deliver normal resolution output.\nDetails:\nVGA - Integrated SIS Real 256E Graphics\nChipset SiS 671FX Northbridge SiS 964 Southbridge\nCPU - Pentium 4 3GHZ with hyperthreading technology.\nSo will I need to find drivers for both the SIS Real 256E and the SiS 671FX? Or just one or the other? Does anyone know where I can download these things because there's not much in the way of Linux graphic support on the section of the Asus website for this board.\nThanks for any help you can offer.

I tried installing multiple versions unsuccessfully until I worked my way down to 9.04.  I've gotten it installed and running as well as I can with the limited support I can access.  Why Dell won't even run any new versions that I've tried from a memory stick.  It seems to reach a certain point and just stops opening.  It stops at the colorful splash screen and that's it.

I'm interested in Ubuntu and would like to put Ubuntu on a 32GB USB drive I have so I can boot it on my mac 10.8.4.\nI don't have room on my local drive at the moment so it would need to be self contained on the usb drive itself. Would someone be willing to help me with this if possible?\nI've seen similar questions but not with the whole of ubuntu on the usb itself.\n\nA: On windows I would use a program called \"iso to usb\". I would burn the iso to the usb key using that. Then I would setup the bios to boot from that. On Macs though, you cannot do this. The efi on macs wont let you boot from a USB key nor is there a similar program to \"iso to usb\" for macs. So, the only option you got is to get an external dvd rewritable or whatever ... drive, and burn ubuntu linux to a disc using that.

Whenever I try to install Ubuntu I run into issues. All the live CD's don't display the Intel raid 5 and show multiple drives.\nWhen I tried the 12.04 alternative, And the Raring Minimal ISO. The raid Does not show the proper partitions.\nWhile The proper partitions look like this.\nIs there any way to solve this issue without recreating the raid?\n\nA: I would seriously counsel against using this so-called 'fake-raid'/'host-raid', i.e. RAID implemented in the regular chipsets on a motherboard. Linux support has always been a bit spotty. Some get it to work, while for others it only leads to pain and suffering. \nI recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 server on a fake-raid system, actually this was because I noticed that the installer seemed to support it, so I wondered if the tide had turned. Soon after, however, I ran into trouble with this setup so I reinstalled on the 'bare' drives and used Linux' own software RAID. The problems were gone and the machine has been fully functional ever since. \nThe problem with 'fake-raid' (which, by the way is also the search term you want to use when Googling this issue), is that it (kernel-) support is very much dependent on manufacturer support. In general I give Intel lots of credit for their Linux hardware support, but it seems like this area is still in need of some attention. \nLinux' own software-RAID is vendor-independent and consequently well tested. \nMoreover, in terms of performance real hardware RAID is usually superior, so that's what enterprise users use (and because of support contracts etc. it is also much better supported by kernel drivers). \n", "Q: How can I install Kobo Desktop on Ubuntu?

It is no longer required, which is why the original was empty; normally, it's not even present, but certain install scripts, such as nvidia, will create backup copies when making a change.\nSo, the failsafe copy is one that will work, but at a reduced resolution and functionality.  It may have been created by an old installer, as I don't think nvidia creates that. But I no longer have nvidia drivers, so I could be mistaken.  If you run the nvidia script more than once, you'll end up with more backups.\nIf there is ever a problem with video, such as no GUI at all, you can often use a terminal to go into the directory and rename the files to change the behavior.  In theory, you can rename xorg.conf to xorg.conf.1, or anything else you want, and then copy the failsafe version to xorg.conf.\nThere is some good information on askubuntu, such as this:\n\nA: man xorg.conf will give you a lot of information in this sense:\n\nNAME\n   xorg.conf, xorg.conf.d - configuration files for Xorg X server\n\nINTRODUCTION\n   Xorg  supports  several  mechanisms for supplying/obtaining configuration\n   and run-time parameters: command line options, environment variables, the\n   xorg.conf  and xorg.conf.d configuration files, auto-detection, and fall‐\n   back defaults. When the same information is supplied  in  more  than  one\n   way,  the highest precedence mechanism is used. The list of mechanisms is\n   ordered from highest precedence to lowest. Note that not  all  parameters\n   can  be  supplied via all methods. The available command line options and\n   environment variables (and some defaults) are described in the Xserver(1)\n   and  Xorg(1) manual pages. Most configuration file parameters, with their\n   defaults, are described below. Driver and module  specific  configuration\n   parameters are described in the relevant driver or module manual page.\n\n\nxorg.conf.failsafe file is for the case in which you messed up something on your machine and you need to boot in failsafe mode. For this reason the use of the generic VESA video driver. Again, for more information you can call man vesa:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       vesa  is  an Xorg driver for generic VESA video cards.  It can drive most\n       VESA-compatible video cards, but only makes use  of  the  basic  standard\n       VESA  core  that is common to these cards.  The driver supports depths 8,\n       15 16 and 24.\n\n\nAnd finally, for xorg.conf.nvidia-xconfig-original file, again you will find enough information in man pages. man nvidia-xconfig:\n\n   --restore-original-backup\n          Restore  a  backup of the X configuration that was made before any\n          changes were made by nvidia-xconfig, if such a  backup  is  avail‐\n          able. This type of backup is made by nvidia-xconfig before it mod‐\n          ifies an X configuration file that it has not previously  touched;\n          this  is  assumed  to be an X configuration file that predates the\n          involvement of the NVIDIA X driver. As an example,  nvidia-xconfig\n          will  copy  an  X  configuration  file  at  /etc/X11/xorg.conf  to\n          /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia-xconfig-original the first time it makes\n          changes to that file.\n\n\n", "Q: More Nvidia problems following upgrade I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.3 on a Toshiba Satellite L745. I've been doing this happily for two years now but sporadically have Nvidia-related problems following Ubuntu updates. 24 hours ago I accepted all available updates and now I cannot boot.\nI have fixed this problem before using advice on ask ubuntu pages such as: Can I install extra drivers via the command prompt?\nHowever, this time the computer will not respond to jockey-text commands (dbus.exceptions) and tells me Nvidia current is already installed. I am unable to boot Ubuntu after a couple of hours of trying and am getting frustrated. Reboot attempts confirm the problem is nvidia based: \n\nthe nvidia kernel module has 310.44 but this nvidia driver component has 304.88\n\n\nA: I fixed this by reinstalling the Nvidia drivers. I'm not sure exactly how I managed to do this and the solution was not 100% - rebooting was temperamental each time and switching off took an unusual route also. Anyway the computer was useable but...\nLo and behold, the same thing happened a fortnight later when new updates (which I had hoped would restore the previous smooth performance) again led to a no boot scenario. and it was harder to fix. \nI just got a black screen with blinking cursor. Ctrl+Alt+F1 gets you into the TTY1 terminal (and F2 into the TTY2 terminal etc) then you can try various fixes you can find on the web (of course you need another machine to do the research while your computer is down).\nI tried about 15 different suggested fixes before I got lucky. I could not get into Grub. Lots of commands were rejected (gtk-warning-cannot-open-display), \"no screens found\", module errors etc.\nEventually I uninstalled all Nvidia components:\nsudo sh NVIDIA* --uninstall\n\nThen reinstalled by:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nsudo apt-get install linux-kernel-headers * \n\nI could then reboot (sudo reboot) and see my desktop for the first time in hours. The resolution had changed, but that's easily fixed. \nI post this answer for my benefit next time this happens to me (it's four or five times in 18 months now) and for anyone else going through the same misery. It can be fixed, keep trying!\n", "Q: Clean unwanted files after an incomplete download, Ubuntu 12.04.2 I am currently working on getting eclipse installed on Ubuntu 12.04.2 on a live USB of 4GB with 3000MB as persistence.

This means that in order to use one, you must have the authority to change - access basic system settings. The root user has such privileges and can actually use a port  from the range 0 - 1024.\nIn your problem as you can see, the system through Apache2 response indicates the root of the problem ([...]could not bind to address blah blah 80):\n(13)Permission denied: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80\n(13)Permission denied: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80\n\nWhen the Apache2 http daemon starts, it tries to bind the 80 port as it is the default port for use in HTTP see, which is a port within the system assigned ports and as such it can only be accessed by root.\nYou executed the start command as a typical user without root privileges and led to failure to do so.\nIn simple words:\nYou:\n\nHi Apache2. I am Kongthap and I am telling you to start (/etc/init.d/apache2 start)\n\nApache2:\n\nOK. I am starting (Starting web server apache2)\nSystem, please give me port 80 to use and listen for connections.\n\nSystem:\n\nOK. One moment to check...\nAhh... Sorry Apache2 but I cannot let you run at 80 port, it is for personal use.\nAnd you do not have the correct privileges to bind it. (Operation not permitted)\n\nApache2:\n\nOhh, Kongthap I failed to start, the System did not let me do it ((13)Permission denied:[...])\n\nConclusion\nThere are mainly two solutions to this problem:\n\n*\n\n*Run the Apache2 HTTP daemon with root privileges using sudo:\nsudo service apache2 start\n\nor:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start\n\n\n\n*Change the default port from 80 to something greater than 1024, say 2000, 2500, 9000, etc. A typical port to run when in such situation is 8080\nsudo vi /etc/apache2/ports.conf\n\nlook for or if not there add:\nListen 8080\n\nor any other port of your choice such as port > 1024 and the selected port is not used by another process.\n\nA: Check the selinux port context by issuing command\nsemanage port -l | grep http\n\nIf it's present in the http_port_t list then it's OK, otherwise add your port by\nsemanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 80\n\nor something that you want to assign.\n\nA: This is an selinux error, or at least it was in my case. Either change the boolean, disable selinux, or set it for permissive with setenforce 0. \nThe boolean change would require you to run getenforce -a | grep http, and look for the \"allow http connect network\".

Want to copy it's 650 GB HDD (only 30-40 gb used, but partitions fit HDD totally) to 500 GB hdd so that I can just replace HDD's and turn on server again without time waste. After 0time of researching on google I found tool named DD. but it's copying RAW data of HDD's and destination HDD must be exactly same size.\nWhat tool can you suggest for this reason?  \n\nA: I would use GParted:\n\n\n*\n\n*for data security back up the original hdd (e.g. using dd)\n\n*make the new and the old hdd available to the same system (e.g. your server)\n\n*start GParted (as sudo)\n\n*shrink the biggest partition of the original hdd to a lower value (to fit to the smaller hdd)\n\n*copy and paste all partitions to the new hdd\n\n*start processing\nTo correct booting if necessary you can use this: http://gparted.org/faq.php (GRUB fails to boot.

I'll give you a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and copy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install 12.04 on the new disk in a different computer. Update it to the same level as the production server.\n\n*Copy all the files over using rsync -av from a LiveCD.\n\n\nIdeally you'd do this with fresh hardware for zero-downtime but if you don't have hardware for another server (even a temporary one), you can turn off the server, pop in the new HD and install Ubuntu onto it and then copy the data from the older disk. That's probably somewhere just over an hour of downtime if you're fast.\n\n*Resize the existing partitions, and copy over and fix MBR:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a LiveCD on the server\n\n*Open Gparted and shrink the existing partitions so they'll fit on the smaller disk\n\n*Copy them over\n\n*Still in the LiveCD session, use these reinstall grub instructions to install grub on the smaller, newer HD.\n\n\n", "Q: How do I install software from the Gnome Extensions Website? I have installed Gnome Addon, but when I go to the Gnome Shell Extensions, I still can't find any ON/OFF sliders.\n\nA: First you need to install Gnome-Shell which can be done either, by using Ubuntu Software Center and searching for GNOME Shell or by using Terminal and the proper apt-get install.. commands, depending on your OS and version number. \nExample for Ubuntu 11.10\nExample for Ubuntu 12.10\nExample for Ubuntu 13.04\nAlso of interest might be the Gnome Wiki\nSecondly you can download a program, called Advanced Settings (Tweak advanced Gnome3 settings), using Ubuntu Software Center again, which is very helpful as well to choose a gnome-shell theme, window and icon theme, manage fonts and font size and gnome-extensions.\nIt is also very helpful, like in the response-comments stated above, that you edit your question and add the following information: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu version\n\n*Gnome Desktop Environment installed/or not \n\n\n\nSource: Gnome Shell Extensions Homepage > About\nI'm using GNOME 3. Why can't I install extensions? \nIf you are using GNOME 3.4 or newer and installation still doesn't work, check to make sure that the \"GNOME Shell Integration\" plugin is installed and enabled in your browser preferences. Some browsers have a feature, click-to-play, which make it so the plugin cannot start without user intervention. Make sure that either http://extensions.gnome.org is whitelisted for the click-to-play feature, or click-to-play is turned off entirely. Check your browser's help for more details.\nIf you are behind a proxy, make sure you have configured your proxy in both your browser's configuration dialog as well as GNOME's Network panel under System Settings. GNOME Shell Extensions needs both settings panels configured for the one-click installation to work.\nSome distributions don't quite package GNOME correctly. Make sure that you have the unzip package installed.\nIf you have checked all of these solutions and are still having trouble installing extensions, please file a bug report using the link in the footer of the page, giving your GNOME version, distribution and version, what solutions you have already tried, as well as what the Looking Glass says in both the Extensions and Errors tabs. It's also helpful to have a copy of the ~/.xsession-errors file from the session that you installed extensions from. \n\nA: I experienced a similar issue on CentOS, this post ranks high in search results so I thought I should share what I learned.

It walks all firefox windows, all tabs and gets the relevant information which is the last entry inside of \"entries\".\nIf we could use xpath to parse it, it would be something like: /windows/*/tabs/last()/url (my xpath knowledge is rusty).\ncat $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/*default/sessionstore.js | php -r '\n$json=json_decode(fgets(STDIN), TRUE);\nforeach($json[\"windows\"] as $w)\nforeach($w[\"tabs\"] as $t)\necho end($t[\"entries\"])[\"url\"].\"\\n\";'\n\nOr, with perl (but first, sudo apt-get install libjson-pp-perl):\ncat $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/*default/sessionstore.js | perl -e '\nuse JSON qw( decode_json );\nmy $json = decode_json(<STDIN>);\nforeach my $w ( @{$json->{\"windows\"}} ) {\n    foreach my $t ( @{$w->{\"tabs\"}} ) {\n        print $t->{\"entries\"}[-1]->{\"url\"}.\"\\n\";\n    }\n}'\n\n\nA: This is how you can extract the current URL of the front-most/active tab in Firefox:\ncat recovery.js | php -r '$json=json_decode(fgets(STDIN), TRUE); $tindex = $json[\"windows\"][0][\"selected\"]-1; $eindex = $json[\"windows\"][0][\"tabs\"][$tindex][\"index\"]-1; echo $json[\"windows\"][0][\"tabs\"][$tindex][\"entries\"][$eindex][\"url\"];'\n\nExplanation: First, it finds the index of the active tab $tindex and then the index of the active history entry in this tab $eindex.\nEvery 15 seconds Firefox creates a backup in *default/sessionstore-backups/recovery.js.\n\nA: This requires the jq package, which can be installed with sudo apt-get install jq:\njq '.windows[].tabs[].entries[].url' ~/.mozilla/firefox/xkxwaf4z.default/sessionstore-backups/recovery.js\n\nCheck the path in ~/.mozilla/firefox and replace xkxwaf4z with the correct name.\n", "Q: Classicmenu indicator revert old icon after update to 0.08 Today I've updated the super-cool classicmenu indicator to it's latest 0.08 version.\nHowever I don't like the brand new icon at all.

I have a notebook with an AMD graphics card and I use it for games occasionally. The performance in Ubuntu 13.04 using open-source drivers is only OK, but I understand that mesa 9.2, combined with a new kernel (I have 3.11rc7 already installed) should improve performance a lot.\nI had bad experiences using unstable PPAs in the past (like x-edgers) so I decided to wait for a stable version of Mesa. Now that it is out, will it be uploaded to standard Ubuntu repositories? If not, is there a stable Mesa PPA or something similar?\n\nA: This instructions are meant to read twice before doing anything.\nYou can build mesa yourself, of course this will require lots of wits and brace yourself in case something goes wrong.\nFor this just download the mesa sources (you must make sure that the deb-src entries in your sources.list are enabled):\nwget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/mesa_9.2.orig.tar.gz https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/mesa_9.2-1ubuntu1.diff.gz https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/mesa_9.2-1ubuntu1.dsc\n\nNow we will need the building dependencies:\nsudo apt-get build-dep mesa\n\nSince the package is already debianized, it will give you a scapegoat to revert back any change made by the installation. Now we should extract our sources:\ndpkg-source -x mesa_9.2-1ubuntu1.dsc\ncd mesa-9.2/\ndpkg-buildpackage \n\nNow, we can build with dpkg-buildpackage. The process will leave you with a bunch of .deb files in the parent directory. You should install the ones that you need. Done.\nIf in any case you hit:\n\ndpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: llvm-3.3-dev (>= 1:3.3-4) libelf-dev\n  dpkg-buildpackage: warning: build dependencies/conflicts unsatisfied; aborting\n\nThis means that your libraries are too old to build the package. You can download the file and install it from saucy at your own risk.\nTL;dr: having the bleeding edge on software is nice, but it has it risk. I would wait until they get released in Saucy. (I'm using Debian and the package is already on experimental, so I just have to chill out for a bit)\n\nA: For Mesa specifically you could try this PPA out. It's supposed to be more stable than Xorg-edgers. From the PPA description:\n\nThis PPA provides updated X (2D) and mesa (3D) free graphics drivers\n  for radeon, intel and nvidia hardware. It is somewhat inspired by the\n  xorg-edgers PPA but it only provides graphics drivers to lower the\n  risk of package breakage and other problems.\n\nYou can find more information on the Phoronix thread.\n\nA: First you need to download Mesa 9.2.  From the primary Mesa download site\nOnce downloaded need to unpack the files.  To unpack .tar.gz files:\ntar zxf MesaLib-x.y.z.tar.gz\n\nPrerequisites for building\nlex / yacc - for building the GLSL compiler. On Linux systems, flex and bison are used. Versions 2.5.35 and 2.4.1, respectively, (or later) should work.\npython - Python is needed for building the Gallium components. Version 2.6.4 or later should work.\nBuilding with autoconf (Linux/Unix/X11)\nThe primary method to build Mesa on Unix systems is with autoconf. The general approach is the standard:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nBut please read the detailed autoconf instructions for more details.\nFor more detailed info, see the Mesa website\nFor uninstalling/reverting see below:\nCheck the makefile for a make uninstall.\nIf that doesn't work or doesn't exist, the best to do is carefully read the make install and manually undo what it did.\nAnother way is:\nDownload the source again.\nRun the configure script that comes with the source. This will rebuild the Makefile.\nDon't run make.\nTo uninstall, most Makefiles define an uninstall command which you would run like this:\nsudo make uninstall\n\nSource:The Mesa 3D Graphics Library\n\nA: Currently there is nothing like that \nThere are only these two ppa's mentioned above. \nThe stabele one from  Lucid 10.04 to 12.10 Quantal: \nppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nThe unstable one from Precise 12.04 to saucy 13.10 (beta): \nppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nThe  short answer of this is No there is currently no stable ppa for MESA 9.2 on Ubuntu 13.4 because the source for the 13.04 branche is maintained in the edgers ppa. \nSo currently the only way to upgrade is to use tee edgers ppa.\n", "Q: how to backup data from usb drive using dd or dd_rescue in ubuntu I mistakenly deleted some important zip files from my micro-sd card.

I have installed, already, ubuntu (latest) on SSD OCZ Vertex 4 (everything, home, tmp, /, swap, etc). \nI have two other HDDs. One is just Windows (used by my wife, only) and one is used to just store big media files (300GB each).\nSomeone told me that swap and tmp files will wear out my SSD. Is this true?\nHaving this installation, what should I do now, in order to protect my SSD?\n\nA: Even continual writing on modern SSDs (which yours is) will still get tens of years of life before things start deteriorating. On OCZ drives there's also an overhead the controller uses to swap out bad sectors to further enhance the lifetime.\nThat's not to say that faults don't happen before then but that's true of all hardware, and let's be honest here, mostly true of mechanical disks.\nI wouldn't be too concerned. Back things up as usual (when SSDs \"go\", they really just stop working so there's no freezer or knocking option to restabilise the platters) and you'll be fine.\nMinimising swap usage is just generally good business. Add RAM if you're swapping lots.\nAnd once you have a load of RAM, mounting /tmp with tmpfs (a RAM-based cache) is generally a good idea. I've added this to /etc/fstab:\ntmpfs       /tmp        tmpfs   defaults,noatime,mode=1777  0   0\ntmpfs       /var/tmp    tmpfs   defaults,noatime,mode=1777  0   0\n\nThat'll have the added bonus of speeding things up, but it does require you have enough RAM or you'll just be swapping to disk (and that's much slower).\n", "Q: Does \"old\" rsh exist in Ubuntu?

You need to update-grub when you wanna do this. \nBut when you decided to install Windows 7 after Ubuntu has been installed, you will have to leave an unallocated partition before the partition where Ubuntu was installed. So using Gparted, you will provide a space for Windows 7, leave an un-allocated space on the left side.\nWhen you install Windows after Ubuntu, windows 7 bootloader will take over and you will not be able to boot Ubuntu. so you need to fix your Grub Boot Loader, and let it handle your dual-boot mode. \nSo you might wanna read some more info about it, below are some helpful links:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I install Windows 7 after I've installed Ubuntu?\n\n*WindowsDualBoot\n\n*Google Search\n\nGoodluck\n", "Q: Mount disc Xfs filesystem How can I mount a disc with a xfs file system?\nI'm using sudo mount /dev/sdc2 /media/mntiomega i receive the error: you must specify the filesystem\n\nA: You should specify the filesystem since mount don't recognize it:\nsudo mount -t xfs /dev/sdc2 /media/mntiomega\n\nThat should do the trick.

To fix this, you need to change the script file itself so that it following *nix conventions.  The answer above suggests a couple of good ways to do that.

I use edquota to specify the amount of disk space for user after edit fstab file. Here are some questions I'm confusing.\nI have enabled disk quota in the \"/\" inside fstab file. The problem is when I use the command sudo repquota -a, you can see that the block size of my test2 user is 48928 KB\n\nLet's compare the total amount of disk space of test2 user by issuing the command\nsudo du -hc /home/test2\n\n\nSee what? The du command calculated the whole test2's home directory only 2MB. So why repquota calculates that much? 48MB.\n\nBy the way, How can I config the disk limit for user's home directory only? Is that useful? Because users only have permission of thier home directory. But I just want to know if it can be done.\n\nA: Because when you use du -hc /home/test2, as you can see you don't have permission access at some files from /home/test2. Use:\nsudo du -hc /home/test2\n\nas you used for repquota -a.\nAlso, if you used -h (--human-readable) for du you should use -s (--human-readable) for repquota.

By moving systems around you're likely to break your boot, so boot-repair is a good thing to have in case you can't boot.\n\n*Make a full backup of the disk with clonezilla and store it somewhere secure (like an external hard drive that won't be connected during the following process). Make sure you have an image of the whole drive, not just the partitions.\n\n*Shut down, plug the new disk, boot normally and format your new disk as you want it.\n\n*Reboot on boot-repair.\n\n*From there, you have a pretty full-featured ubuntu, only with the addition of boot-repair. You can copy the system files from /dev/sdc5 to your new disk (let's say /dev/sdd1). Important: use cp -a to get an exact copy of the system (with symbolic links preserved and all). A normal copy (including through nautilus) would probably break a few things (and you would realize it only much later on).\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab and point / to /dev/sdd1\n\n*Execute boot-repair (I don't remember if it's on the desktop or the sidebar, or if it starts automatically... I only used it once or twice but I remember it was pretty obvious).\n\n*Boot-repair should recognize Windows and your 2 Ubuntus. You might want to edit your old system out. If the copy isn't seen at this point, you can still cancel everything, just restart normally, because you haven't modified your system yet (we just copied the files, not deleted them).\n\n*Reboot. If it didn't work, don't panic, boot on boot-repair again and try other settings. I had to do that a couple of times before it actually worked.\n\n*Reboot on Ubuntu, making sure you are on /dev/sdd1. Open Gparted, remove the old Linux and resize your Windows partition. Last time I did that it was with Vista, next time I booted on Windows I had to insert the installation CD to repair Windows, and then use boot-repair because it did override the bootloader. Maybe things improved since then, maybe not.\n\n\nThis should really work easily, although I never went through all these steps at once. If anything goes wrong before step 6, you still have your system intact. If anything goes wrong after that, you have a backup of your disk with clonezilla that you can restore. Although before step 9 you really still have your old system on which you can boot normally, which means you can check your system works before you erase it.\nLong story short, whatever you choose to do, the only things that can (and will) happen is a broken boot that can be easily fixed by boot-repair.\nPS: to answer on the usage of clonezilla, I wouldn't attempt to restore a clonezilla image on a drive of a different size, but anyway if it works this would basically be the same as a cp -a. And you'd have to use boot-repair anyway to be able to boot on your new system, so it looks a bit overkill to me.\n", "Q: unable to use the 13.04 applications after login Installed 13.04 and after login the desktop files are displayed for the home folder.\nBut I am not sure how to run applications moving the muse to the edges shows nothing.\nI can use Ctrl + T and  Ctrl + Q and can press Mail and Web dedicated buttons from the keyboard but I want to install my previous apps especially Gnome, so how can I call up the sotware centre?\n\nA: I don't know what you mean to install \"Gnome\" since you are in fact using \"Gnome 3\".

If a moderator disagrees this answer could be demoted to a comment on the selected answer if more appropriate.)\nThe reference to pavucontrol was rather cryptic and this response somewhat less usable to me, but it did put me onto a solution.\nI had none of the permission and ownership problems that seem to be the main focus here. pavucontrol, which I had to install for just this purpose, did allow me, on the playback tab, to change from \"High Definition Audio Controller Digital Stereo (HDMI)\" to \"Built-in Audio Analog Stereo\" and my audio began working again as it had before.\nI still don't know I got my ThinkPad (running Mint 13 which is basically Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) into this unworking state, but this is how I was able to get audio (in particular, Audacious Player using Pulse) working. I hope this helps.\n\nA: Ok, I got it in the end.\nIt was a permission problem with my home folder and pulseaudio. \nRun the following command to fix the $HOME directory permissions for the current $USER:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME/\n\nI used http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/problem-with-pulse-audio-834041/ and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6208727 as sources.\nThe solution for me was to fix the permissions using the following command: sudo chown -R lionel:lionel /home/lionel and then using pavucontrol to unmute the output.\nThe gnome indicator is still greyed but music is back, and that's a good thing.\n\nA: having the  same problem as the OP, but not being able to change permissions on $HOME I found a different way to start pulseaudio: explicitly start pulseaudion with a different $HOME, like\n> HOME=/tmp/$USER pulseaudio --start\n\nwhich now runs the program for me. Make sure /tmp/$USER exists.\nhth\n\nA: In my case this was caused by me creating a file ~/.config/pulse/default.pa. The bulletproof solution to fix my sound settings issue was removing the directory with my pulseaudio preferences:\nrm -rf ~/.config/pulse/\n\n\nA: I don't have enough rep to comment and thank @Wanderer, but his hack works perfectly for me. Don't ever let the negativity stop you!\nHOME=/tmp/$USER pulseaudio --start\n\nYes, it would be better to understand where the permission error lies, but I redid all my permissions for the last hour to no avail. I have my User directory on another partition symbolic linked, I've changed perms for the link, for the physical location, for the Home directory to no avail.

After that there was no boot option for the USB in the System Setup anymore, which was there before under the title 'Uefi 8.0x'.\nHow can I now boot from my USB?\n\nA: I have a few suggestions, none of which is guaranteed to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try checking your firmware options; several may be relevant:\n\n*\n\n*There may be one to enable/disable booting from USB devices.\n\n*There may also be options related to USB initialization. Some settings will cause the computer to skip USB initialization altogether or to do \"quick\" initialization.\n\n*\"Fast boot\" options may cause the system to skip or do \"quick\" USB initialization, so disable any such setting you find.\n\n\n*Try unplugging your USB boot device, reboot, plug the device back in, and reboot again.\n\n*Try installing my rEFInd boot manager. There's a chance that it will present a boot option that your built-in boot manager doesn't. (Note that you'll need to uncomment and adjust the scanfor line if you want to boot BIOS-mode USB flash drives.) Also, check back in the future, because I'm working on improving the legacy boot options, which might cause rEFInd to detect such devices more reliably. The code isn't ready for release just yet, though. If you install rEFInd via its Debian package or by running the install.sh script, it will become your default boot manager. If you want to keep using GRUB for that, you'll need to do a manual installation (skipping the use of efibootmgr) and then adjust your GRUB configuration to provide an option to launch rEFInd.\n\n*Try mounting a USB device that has an EFI boot mode and then using efibootmgr to add an entry to the EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi file on that device. (Read the efibootmgr man page or see here for information on using efibootmgr.) Note that the entry you create will work only for the EFI-bootable medium you've just registered (it won't work for another USB flash drive), and some EFIs might erase it if you boot with the flash drive unplugged.\n\n", "Q: how to power save and lookup power usage in terminal I have already installed  powertop , pm-utils , laptop-mode-tool , jupitor  , also power save with jupitor , cpu-frequency skilling powersave , pm-powersave true but power usage are 1 hour and 20 minutes on 50 percentage of battery , at least 130 minutes in window seven . \nUbuntu 12.04.3 kernel 3.8 \n,lenovo z400\n,ivy i5-3230 M\n,nvidia 740m with Intel 4000.\n\nA: Ubuntu having two power tools which can work efficiently through terminal and can give you complete information about your power statistics, they are powetop and powerstat. you can install them with \nsudo apt-get install powertop\n\n& \nsudo apt-get install powerstat\n\nTo run powertop you must be root user , so run it as sudo.I mean\nsudo powertop\n\nThen you will see ( captured in my PC , usually No battery :P , just for Idea ) \n\npowerstat you can run as normal user also , it will provide the complete status information of the battery.\nhope that helps you about Command line power monitoring tools.\n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 on a new Ubuntu computer I just received a new Alienware computer with Ubuntu pre-installed, since updated to version 12.04.  I would like to install Windows 7 or 8 (I have installation discs for both) to run some programs.  Any advice for a Ubuntu novice on how to do this?  Thanks!\n\nA: You should first make a separate partition using Gparted. It is a good tool to create/add/delete/manage partitions of your HDD. Since you got pre-installed Ubuntu, It may not be installed already.\nOpen a terminal(CTRL+ALT+T) then execute following:\n    $ sudo apt-get install gparted\n\nOpen gparted from dash and make partition as required. Gparted so easy to use that any one can grab it. I prefer you to install Windows 7. It is possible that after installing Windows, you will not be able to access Ubuntu. But don't worry, you can fix this issue very easily, if you have a bootable CD of Ubuntu.\nFor more information you can prefer following link:\nHow to dual boot Windows 7 x64 and Ubuntu 13.04 x64 as BIOS, not EFI\nYou have to follow the preferred answer(i,e answer which is marked as tick).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 can't see eth0 after update from 12.04 I just updated my laptop from Ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10.

Let's say our interface is ens192. To check whether it's being managed by NetworkManager:\ncat /run/NetworkManager/conf.d/netplan.conf\n\nWhich could output this:\n[keyfile]\n# devices managed by networkd\nunmanaged-devices+=interface-name:ens192,\n\nBackup the configuration file (your path or file may be different):\ncp /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml.ori\n\nThen edit /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml to look something like:\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# For more information, see netplan(5).\nnetwork:\n  version: 2\n  ethernets:\n    ens192:\n      dhcp4: false\n      wakeonlan: true\n      addresses:\n        - 192.168.14.2/24\n      gateway4: 192.168.14.1\n      nameservers:\n        addresses: [8.8.8.8]\n\nGenerate the output file with debug for extra details:\nsudo netplan --debug generate\n\nWe'd like to see:\nDEBUG:command generate: running ['/lib/netplan/generate']\n** (generate:9991): DEBUG: 18:08:30.447: Processing input file //etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml..\n** (generate:9991): DEBUG: 18:08:30.447: starting new processing pass\n** (generate:9991): DEBUG: 18:08:30.448: ens192: setting default backend to 1\n** (generate:9991): DEBUG: 18:08:30.448: Generating output files..\n** (generate:9991): DEBUG: 18:08:30.449: NetworkManager: definition ens192 is not for us (backend 1)\n\nWe can see the actual configuration with:\ncat /run/systemd/network/10-netplan-ens192.network\n\nLet's make it active by:\nsudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd\n\nBe prepared to lose the connection if doing this over SSH. Do man netplan for details. There is also a related answer on this site. See also the documentation.\n\nA: OP posted:\n\nSetting Static IP\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces #  I use vi instead of nano\n\nWhen you open up the interfaces doc, you will see something like this:\nauto lo eth0\niface lo inet loopback\niface eth0 inet dynamic\n\nYou want to change it to incorporate the following:\nauto lo eth0\niface lo inet loopback\niface eth0 inet static\n        address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (enter your ip here)\n        netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (mine was 255.255.255.0)\n        gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (enter gateway ip here,usually the address of the router)\n\nSave your changes and exit.\nThen I needed to add some dns info to resolv.conf so I opened up the\n  file like so:\nsudo nano /etc/resolv.conf # I use vi instead of nano\n\nInitially this file is empty excluding a warning of \"Do not put\n  anything in here it will be overwritten\". I added the following\n  information none the less.\nThis is the format:\nnameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(enter your dns server ip)\nnameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(enter your alt dns server ip)\n\nThis is what I entered:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8 \nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nSave your changes and exit.\nAt this point you can either restart networking:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart  \n\nor reboot which is what I did:\nsudo reboot\n\nOnce I was logged back in I tried the install again of pure-ftpd and\n  all is good:\napt-get install pure-ftpd\n\nI hope this helps someone, I looked around for the fix and just\n  happened upon it by accident.\n\n\nA: It seems the interface eth0 was configured before and the address was kept persistently (for some reason) by the kernel.\nTo clear all addresses from interface eth0 without having to restart network services or bringing the interface up/down :\nsudo ip addr flush dev eth0\n\nThen you can use ifup to configure eth0 by reading /etc/network/interfaces file :\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nFor verbosity :\nsudo ifup -v eth0\n\n\nA: The only thing that worked for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*go into modem config (http://192.168.0.1)\n\n*set up DHCP Reservation Lease: it maps LAN IPs to MAC addresses\n\n*set the interface to use DHCP (the default, modifiable on NetworkManager at nm-connection-editor)\n\n\nA: ==== Configure static IP on Ubuntu 14.04\nin file /etc/network/interfaces  \niface eth0 inet static\naddress 10.193.36.29\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 10.193.36.1\ndns-nameservers 10.124.31.140  10.213.134.41  10.72.255.100\n\nthen: \nsudo ifup eth0\n\nneed some time to take effect\n", "Q: Acces to my PC from hostile Access Point I connected to a Wifi access point that had cloned my SSID.\nI did not enter my ubuntu password during the connection, since I did not install anything. I just used Firefox for several minutes.\nIs there any theoretical chance of anybody accessing my data or changing anything in the system or BIOS?\n\nA: All* the risk lies with web stuff. There are possible attack vectors that you may have been exposed to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unsecure web traffic was probably logged, cookies read. This allows people to log in as you on websites that aren't using HTTPS. This usually isn't a reset-your-password thing but you do need to invalidate your old sessions. How this works is largely dependent on the website.\n\n*See any certificate errors? If you did, your HTTPS traffic was also likely compromised.\n\n*Chat clients are habitually a bit weaker. IRC can use SSL but usually wont by default. Skype (and others from its generation) should be fine.\nSoftware installation and updates (through the repos) are largely unaffected by bad networks because everything is signed. Package lists need to match up with their keys. Package hashes need to match up with their package lists. It's hard to properly interfere with that process.\nIf the SSID is still out there, download a Wifi scanner on your phone (many exist) and follow the signal strength. Get a good idea where it's coming from and then call the police. The person you've found is committing a fairly serious crime.\n* Assuming you don't have open services inside your network (eg you have a server on your laptop that \"trusts\" anything with the same subnet). If you do (and some people do - I do but I'm wired) the level of risk depends on what you're running but I doubt there are many automated SSID-clone-hackers out there which will probe you too thoroughly.\n", "Q: Why doesn't $HOME change if I use sudo? I expected the -H option to give me the target user's environment.\n\nnbest@geo:~$ sudo -H -u tanum echo $HOME\n/home/nbest\nnbest@geo:~$ sudo -u tanum echo $HOME\n/home/nbest\nnbest@geo:~$ sudo -i -u tanum echo $HOME\n/home/nbest\nnbest@geo:~$ sudo -H -i -u tanum echo $HOME\n/home/nbest\n\nThis would allow me to say:\nsudo -u tanum ls ~\n\nand get the target user's home directory listing.  Not the case.  Is this caused by the env_reset default in sudoers?\nIf so does -H have any effect?  What is the safest way to override this behavior?\nIf not what is the intended effect of -H?\nPlease set me straight.\n\nA: Please try:\nsudo -H -u tanum bash -c 'echo $HOME'\n\n\nA: $HOME and ~ get expanded by your shell, they are not interpreted by echo.\nIn other words, echo does not see $HOME as an argument. It actually sees /home/nbest. Therefore the following commands are exactly identical (in your case):\nnbest@geo:~$ sudo -H -u tanum echo $HOME\nnbest@geo:~$ sudo -H -u tanum echo /home/nbest\n\nWhatever you try (-H, -i, ...) you will never obtain the wanted behavior. Because $HOME is replaced by your shell and your shell runs as your user. sudo does not affect your shell in any way.\n\nTo work around this 'issue' (which actually is a feature), you can start a new subshell:\nnbest@geo:~$ sudo -H -u tanum sh -c 'echo $HOME'\n\n(Note that I'm using single quotes to avoid expansion.) This way, the new shell sh will run as user tanum and print his home directory.\n\nAn another alternative is to use ~username, which gets expanded to the home of that user, without the need of using sudo or su. Try:\nnbest@geo:~$ echo ~tanum\n\n", "Q: Windows 8 on SSD, Ubuntu 12.04.3 on HDD, EasyBCD not working here, how to boot into Ubuntu? I have Windows 8 on an SSD, and I put Ubuntu 12.04.3 on a partition on my hard drive. Since the boot order is set to read from the SSD first, I had to change something. I read some related threads on here about using EasyBCD, so I downloaded that and tried it.\nFirst, I tried just adding Ubuntu to the boot order. It appeared there, but when I selected it, it brought me to a grub command line interface. I tried typing \"boot\", but it said the kernel must be loaded. I tried \"help\", but couldn't figure out how to load the kernel.\nThen I read some more, and followed steps to add NeoGrub to the boot list, but selecting that option just brought me back to the grub command line interface.\nAm I doing something wrong?

Picture this : \nYou have two identicle laptops. Both running Ubuntu with X11. Now rather than having two seperate ubuntu machines is it possible, through XServer, to connect Laptop2 to Laptop1 as a second display that runs in the same session as Laptop1? \nBasically I want to be able to replicate the effect of plugging in an external VGA monitor to Laptop1 with Laptop2. \nI know there are programs like Synergy to act as a virtual KVM between two machines. But you still have two seperate systems with seperate displays and programs and such.\nI know you could use VNC to get laptop1's display on laptop2, but then you have the opposite effect of having one display with two mice and keyboard, on two monitors.\nAside from the issues with those solutions, I'm trying to do this without too much bloat, and I know XServer has remote capabilities, but I don't yet have the knowledge to implement what I'm trying to do. \nI'm looking for either specific ways to do this or references to specific documentation to help me implement this.\n\nA: No, you cannot do this, because there is no way to connect the screen on the second laptop to the video output of the first.\n\nA: Actually after doing some more serious digging I found that the xdmx project serves all my needs. It uses a proxy x server to connect multiple x servers on seperate machines. \n", "Q: Reducing multiple mp3 bitrate I'm looking for a tool for Ubuntu 13.04 that can reduce the bitrate of multiple mp3 files. Does anyone happen to know such a tool?\n\nA: Reducing the bit rate will involve re-encoding, which means that you'll have to create separate output files. You could use avconv from the command-line:\navconv -i input.mp3 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k output.mp3\n\nTo do a whole directory of .mp3s:\nfor f in ./*.mp3; do avconv -i \"$f\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k \"${f%.*}-out.mp3\"; done\n\nThis will create files with -out.mp3 at the end of their names. If you want to replace your originals, you can then use mv to overwrite them (warning: this should be considered irreversible):\nfor f in ./*.mp3; do avconv -i \"$f\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k \"${f%.*}-out.mp3\" && mv \"${f%.*}-out.mp3\" \"$f\"; done\n\nIt might be safer to do this in two steps:\nfor f in ./*.mp3; do avconv -i \"$f\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k \"${f%.*}-out.mp3\"; done\nfor f in ./*-out.mp3; do mv \"$f\" \"${f%-out.mp3}.mp3\"; done\n\nYou can do this to files recursively (every .mp3 in the working directory and all sub-directories):\nshopt -s globstar\nfor f in ./**/*.mp3; do avconv -i \"$f\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k \"${f%.*}-out.mp3\"; done\nfor f in ./**/*-out.mp3; do mv \"$f\" \"${f%-out.mp3}.mp3\"; done\n\n\nA: ffmpeg is the tool I'd use, and I'd combine it with find to find the files I wanted converting.\nmkdir converted\nfind . -iname '*.mp3' -exec ffmpeg -i  \"{}\" -b 100k \"{}\" \"converted/{}\" \\;\n\n\nA: Try Audacity.

But you should ask yourself if you really need to. If you're just going to be word processing and making spreadsheets etc then there are plenty of free Linux based options that will be more or less compatible with MS Office. On the other hand if you need total compatibility with Microsoft Office (for other users who may use your files on Windows, for example), then you may want to look at installing MS Office under Linux.\nAs far as viruses go, Linux is far more secure than Windows, but not entirely secure. I doubt installing Windows software in Linux would make it less secure. Take a look at this article on Linux viruses. Generally Windows PC's get viruses because the user does something not so clever.

Also, when compiling with gcc and g++, bash-completion works fine.\n\nA: What you are seeing is a bug in bash-completion.\nLuckly there's a workaround: you can open /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/cc, find the following:\ncomplete -F _gcc gcc g++ g77 gcj gpc &&\n{\n    cc  --version 2>/dev/null | grep -q GCC && complete -F _gcc cc  || :\n    c++ --version 2>/dev/null | grep -q GCC && complete -F _gcc c++ || :\n}\n\nand replace it with the following:\ncomplete -F _gcc gcc g++ g77 gcj gpc cc c++\n\n\nA: I found a really simple and easy way to do it :\nopen .bashrc file\n$ gedit ~/.bashrc\n\nand add the following lines : \ncomplete -f cc\ncomplete -f c++\n\n", "Q: All my LibreOffice macros are gone. How to recover them? I had about 10 saved macros. They appeared under LibreOffice Basic > My Macros > Standard > Module 1. Today, they're all gone. I don't have the slightest idea of how to go about trying to recover them. Any clues?\n\nA: Maybe you can take a look in ~/.config/libreoffice. If you recently upgraded LibreOffice to a new version, it's possible that your old settings weren't transferred. You should find your Basic macro's in .xba files in ~/.config/libreoffice/$VERSION/user/basic/Standard, replacing $VERSION with one of the versions you have/had installed. For example, I apparently have two directories under libreoffice/, viz. 3/ and 4/.\nIf this is the case, and you find your macro's under an older version, use the file manager to copy them to the macro directory of the most recent LibreOffice version. You should be able to see them again when next time you start the LibreOffice. I suggest that before you do this, you back up the original macro directory of the most recent version.\n", "Q: Will dual monitor work with two different connector types? I am looking at two monitors of the exact same type. I have an AMD A4 which includes a 6410D Radeon Chip with the latest proprietary drivers installed. On my motherboard I have one DVI output and one VGA output. Will a dual monitor setup work if I plug one into the DVI port and one into the VGA port? Will there be a difference in quality, or is there anything else I will need to keep in mind?\n\nA: If your card supports multiple monitors (which it should do if it has more than one output) then it should work. I've never hooked up one dvi and one vga monitor but you'd be hard pressed to notice a difference in quality. One of my work PC's has double VGA monitors and the other has one DVI and one HDMI to DVI.

All of it does specify using pam_tally.so or pam_tally2.so, which seem to be the fundamental Linux mechanisms for user authentication. Unfortunately, it also appears that various distros (RHEL, Ubuntu, Cent, etc.) have slight variations for configuration requirements.\nIn 12.10, after enabling pam_tally.so, the main problems I have encountered are related to incorrect tally incrementing:\n\n\n*\n\n*increments 2 times for every login failure\n\n*increments all other users when a user fails\n\n*increments all other when a user switches accounts\n\n\nAnd other variations of this behavior. However, it does lock accounts that exceed the limit, as required, and resets the counter to 0 after a successful login.\npam_tally2.so eliminates some of the errors, such as incrementing all other users when a different user fails, but still increments the user 2 times for every failure.\nHere is what my /etc/pam.d/common-auth looks like:\nauth    required                    pam_tally2.so  file=/var/log/tallylog deny=3\nauth    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so\naccount required            pam_tally2.so\nauth    requisite           pam_deny.so\nauth    required            pam_permit.so\nauth    optional            pam_cap.so \n\nIf I duplicate the instructions on manpages for pam_tally2.so, I am locked out of the machine and have to undo the changes via root from a LiveCD boot.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is pam_tally.so now fully deprecated in favor of pam_tally2.so?\n\n*Does anyone have a working common-auth file they can post, which works exactly as advertised, for 12.10? Any other suggestions are welcome as well.\n\n*Does 13.04 use a different mechanism than pam_tally to manage login counts & lockouts?\n\n\nIf 13.04 does limit logins correctly, with less hassle than 12.10, I would probably migrate to it since limiting login attempts is a necessary feature for this machine. If login attempts cannot be limited in some version of Ubuntu, I will likely have to use another distro, like CentOS.\n\nA: This is from the pam_tally \"man\" page. \n\npam_tally has several limitations, which are solved with pam_tally2. For this\n  reason pam_tally is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n\nYou can view it (and any other command in this format) by entering the following into Terminal:\nman pam_tally\n\nDo you intend to implement lockouts at the keyboard and/or over the network (ssh)?  I don't have an example for you but below you may 'find the answers you seek.'  First you'll need to edit that file you mentioned by entering this from Terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth\n\nAdd this at the top of the file (order of rules matters):\nauth required pam_tally.so per_user magic_root onerr=fail\n\nThis sets the number of allowed attempts\nsudo faillog -m 3\n\nThe -l option sets the lock time.\nfaillog -m 3 -l 3600\n\nTo unlock an account\nfaillog -u login_name -r\n\nCredits: http://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/ubuntu-how-to-faillog/\nGood luck and I hope you make the wise choice to stay with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Python Tkinter packages I'm having some difficulty finding information on which packages I need to use Tkinter.\nThe software centre shows IDLE ...

How do I set up my router (Linksys e4200)? I have the software that came with it but it is for Windows. My computer has Internet access but when I click on Internet connection information I get error: No valid active connections found. I want to set-up the computer to be a server and I need the private IP address from my PC.\n\nA: This website in the section of the webpage called Linksys e4200 Setup has step-by-step instructions for how to set up the Linksys e4200 router manually (without using the Windows installation CD) using the router's web interface at http://192.168.1.1/. To configure the Linksys e4200 router manually, start off with Step 1 and then skip Steps 2-6 and continue with Step 7 until the end of the instructions.\nThese are the instructions from the linked website with the Windows-specific steps 2-6 and other Windows-specific content removed.\n\n*\n\n*Connect the Linksys e4200 router to a power source to turn on and wait for the device to power-up and go through its configuration steps. If choosing to manually configure the router or you do not have an installation CD, proceed to the next step.\n\n\n*Access the web-based configuration utility by entering 192.168.1.1 in your computer's web browser.\n\n\n*Enter \"admin\" for the router login, and \"admin\" for the password followed by clicking the \"OK\" menu button. A new password can be created for the router by selecting the \"Administrative\" and \"Management\" menu options from the primary configuration screen.\n\n\n*Select the \"Setup\" and \"Basic Setup\" menu options. Then select the \"Language\" to be used for the router.\n\n\n*Click the \"Internet Setup\" menu section and enter the connection specifics provided by your respective ISP or school (i.e. connection type, and if your host requires a static IP vice the default DHCP connection).\n\n\n*If connecting via DSL, find out if the ISP uses PPPoE, and if so select this option. Then, enter the username, password, and service name (if required) for your service.\n\n\n*Toggle the \"Keep Alive\" menu option to \"Connect on Demand\" if your ISP charges you for amount of time connected to the internet.\n\n\n*Select the \"Wireless\" and \"Basic Wireless Settings\" menu options.\n\n\n*Under configuration view, select \"WiFi protected setup\" to setup both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks on the router (alternatively they can be manually configured).\n\n\n*Under the manual setup, choose which wireless standards to support under the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz network options. Note, 802.11b and 802.11g devices cannot connect to the 5 GHz network, so ensure the appropriate options are selected on the 2.4 GHz network setup option. Typically, you want to ensure the lowest standard of connection in your home or apartment is supported on that network (i.e. if you have an old laptop, it may only be 802.11b compatible). The \"Mixed\" mode setting will support all standards (A through N).\n\n\n*Disable the SSID broadcast to keep the network name more secure, and if desired change the channel width and number assignments if you are an advanced user on this screen.\n\n\n*Select the \"Wireless\" and \"Wireless Security\" menu options to select between WEP, WPA Personal, WPA 2, WPA Mixed Mode, and WPA2 Personnel security standards on the network. Both the 2.4 and 5 GHz networks can use different security options if desired. WPA2 is the strongest security option available on this router if supported by all client devices.\n\n\n*Decide if you want to allow \"Guest Access\" to surf the Internet using the 2.4 GHz network or not. If you do, then the default option is to do so. If not, then select \"Wireless\" and \"Guest Access\" from the main router setup menu and change the default setting to \"no.\"\n\n\n*Similar to the WRT54G setup, MAC address filtering can be enabled and configured on the e4200N router.\n\n\n*Configure advanced options as desired on the router that include network storage, parental controls (by device), VPN Passthrough, FTP Server, Firewall, (Choose Applications and Gaming from the main router setup menu) Gaming options, and (Choose Storage from the main menu) Media Server.\n\n\n*To enable network storage, a portable hard drive will need to be available to connect to the router. By default, all content on the disk will be accessible without a password. To disable this \"feature\", select \"Storage\" and \"Administration\" and then choose the \"Disabled\" menu option located under \"Anonymous Disk Access\". Shared folders can be used to manage network access to different contents stored on the disk with individual folders or the entire disk available to share. Linksys implements a group and user account policy located under the \"Storage\" and \"Administrative\" menu options.\n\n\n*Save settings and the network configurations will be complete.\n\nA: Look in the official manual for info about login via a browser, or perhaps try this article first, may be faster.\nGenerally most customer grade routers provide a web interface, you may enter an IP address in the browser address bar, provide the credentials included in the manual (or sometimes even on a sticker on the bottom of the device) and configure (almost) everything there.\n", "Q: Error during installation Openldap on ubuntu Please help me to find out why its not working\n\nroot@icloud_mail# sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils\nReading package lists...

Therefore you need to install it in order to build any subversion software. libapache-svn is a different matter. \n\nA: My apologies, but I didn't do a very good job at asking the question in the first place.  In my defense, this was due to many different attempts at solving the problem and I lost track of the steps.\nBut, here is the answer as to why SVN commands were not working, and why upgrading was not working.\nMy problem was that I was using Dropbox to sync my repositories across computers, and I accidentally put a SVN 1.7 repo on a SVN 1.6 machine.\nSVN said that I needed to upgrade, but the SVN upgrade is only available in 1.7, so I got the error \"command does not exist\" (somehow version 1.6 knows that it should exist, because it's in the error message!!!)\nThe other complication was that I couldn't upgrade to 1.7 on this machine using the typical apt-get (update/upgrade/install) commands, because the binary is not available for Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS) though the default PPA resources.\nTo upgrade to SVN 1.7 in Ubuntu 12.04 you need to add a new PPA.  Instructions can be found here: Where can I find a Subversion 1.7 binary?\n\nNote: Look at more than one answer in the link above.  There is a ppa available from the SVN team, and at the time of writing this was not the selected answer\nFrom what I've read (and my personal experience) it's possible sync SVN and Git projects across machines using Dropbox, even across operating systems.  However, it's probably not a good idea, and the change in SVN versions caused some pretty big problems for me.  Now, several of my tracked files have been overwritten in the project and I have to go though a messy process of checking out the entire project again and manually syncing unversioned files.  The overwritten files were replaced with blank files that have the original name, but no content (and they appear to SVN to be the most current version, so a revert doesn't revert them).\nYes I know that keeping unversioned files is not ideal, but I have very good reasons for doing so.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 touch-pad and keyboard problems asus q500a I am using an asus q500a with ubuntu 12.04 unity; linux kernel 3.5.0.39 with windows 8 dual boot.\nI will note that all of my hardware works flawlessly in windows 8 which came with the computer, I just don't like windows.

I added 2GB, giving a total of 3GB.\nAs far as I can tell, it is working OK. For example, I use system-load-indicator and it shows credible amounts of memory used.\nI have run System Testing a few times since having the additional RAM installed, and it has shown FAILED each time.\n\"Meminfo total: 3097452 kB\" is exactly what I would expect.\n\"DMI total: 4096000 kB\" doesn't make any sense to me. There are at least 3 plausible meanings of DMI on acronymfinder.com.\n\"Accuracy: 75.00 Memory totals not close enough\" doesn't make any sense to me either. Not close enough to what? I can see that\nMeminfo/DMI total\n=0.756213867\n=75.6213867%\n\nwhich is kind of about 75.00%.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this where \"75.00%\" comes from?\n\n*What do all these numbers (above) mean?\n\n*In my case, what does FAILED mean?\n\n*If applicable, any suggestions about how NOT to get a FAILED result?\nI suppose at the moment I need to see if the RAM needs to be reseated or something.\n\nA: The Meminfo total: 3097452 kB shows how much RAM your OS can access. So it is 3GB, as you say you have that much memory in your system, so it is fine.\nThe DMI total: 4096000 kB comes from your BIOS and shows how much memory is installed according to the BIOS.\nThe Accuracy: 75.00 Memory totals not close enough is just what you thought, the ratio of the two above: Meminfo_total/DMI_total. (rounded down to 2 decimal places)\nSo this test is for testing if your OS is correctly detecting an using all your available RAM. If the Accuracy is above 90% then the test PASSes, if it is under it FAILs.\nYou may ask the question: Why is it passing when it is above 90%, shouldn't this test only pass if the accuracy is exactly 100%? Since that would mean that the OS has access to all the installed memory, under 100% means there is a problem.\nThe answer is that there is a safe situation when the OS doesn't has access to all the installed memory: When you have an integrated device which uses shared memory and the BIOS reserves some memory for this device from the installed RAM. This is usually an integrated VGA card. So if you have an integrated VGA, it is usually perfectly normal that the accuracy is below 100%, so the test passes even with only 90%. Some minimal RAM is also reserved for some BIOS stuff but those are a negligible amount.\nYou could argue though that 90% is just an arbitrary number, why not 85% or 80%? Yes, it is arbitrary, and I don't know why was exactly 90% chosen for this test. \nYou can view the source code of this test in /usr/share/checkbox/scripts/memory_compare, it is a simple bash script on 12.04, on later releases it is a python script. You can also run it from there with sudo /usr/share/checkbox/scripts/memory_compare \n\nNow it is clear that you have no problems with your RAM, since you installed 3GB and all is available. So why is this test reporting that you have 4GB installed memory?\nTwo situations possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your BIOS has a bug and shows incorrect data. This is less likely.\n\n*The test has a bug when it decodes the BIOS data. This is more likely, like in this bugreport: https://bugs.launchpad.net/checkbox/+bug/960087\nSo to test the second case run sudo dmidecode -t 17, this is how the test gains access to the BIOS data about RAM. Observe the output if it contains only RAM modules. If it outputs other devices, like in the above linked bugreport, and that device has a Size property, then this test will add the size of that device too to the RAM, and the DMI total output will show more RAM than it is available.\nThis bug was corrected in the later releases, from 12.10. But in 12.04 we have the old bash script with the bug. And the output you wrote in your comment is from this old bash version of the script.\n\nA: Execute the following command for a more detailed mem-overview:\ncat /proc/meminfo\n\nUbuntu usually caches a lot of ram which is still free, but shown by other tools as used. So you need to subtract the value cached: from the output of the above command.\n", "Q: Can't uninstall old kernel I can't install a new kernel because by boot partition is full.

I have a 2TB hard drive mounted in an external USB enclosure. The drive label is Backup. The drive is not automatically mounted when I boot. There are two ways I wish to mount it:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a root cron entry that will mount the drive if it is not already mounted. This is part of my nightly backup script.\n\n*As a normal user, I can click the drive label in Dolphin's Places panel and the drive will be mounted.\n\n\nPreviously, the drive would mount at /media/Backup in both cases. \nI manually created the directory /media/Backup previously and it still exists. The directory is required so that my backup script can mount this disk before the backup runs. As I said, this was working as intended before some recent system updates. I want the drive to mount at the same location in both the situations above.\nHowever, with recent system updates (apparently the LTS Raring HWE stack) the drive mounts at /media/myusername/Backup from Dolphin if I mount it from Dolphin as a normal user. It mounts as /media/root/Backup if I mount it as root user.\nThere are a variety of ways this new Ubuntu scheme can fail under my scenario. In fact, it is rountinely failing and my nightly backups are not happening anymore. I won't list all the ways I have seen it fail in my troubleshooting so far. I would simply like to restore the previous behavior for this disk or achieve something that works reliably under the new system. Specifically, what I would like to see is:\n\n\n*\n\n*the drive isn't mounted at boot and isn't mounted unless/until needed.\n\n*whether mounted by my normal user via Dolphin or via a script run as root, the drive is always mounted at the same place (so my backup script can find it).\n\n*if the drive hasn't been mounted yet (i.e., via Dolphin), my backup script (run as root) is able to mount it at the intended location and then proceed with the backup.\n\n*file permissions on files and directories on the mounted drive work as expected\n\n\nHere's all I needed in my root crontab previously. I'd like to get this working again.\n00 03 * * * mount -L Backup /media/Backup >> /var/log/backup.log\n05 03 * * * /opt/storeBackup/bin/storeBackup.pl -f /configfile\n\nI prefer not to change my system-wide default behavior. Therefore, this solution doesn't seem ideal: https://askubuntu.com/a/276670/36661 (and I don't yet know if I have the udisk version that would support that solution).\nI would appreciate comments on this possible solution:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/350399/36661\n\nA: I have given this answer, which may be the best approach. However, there is also a simpler solution based on the new default behavior of udisks2. Ubuntu's switch from udisks1 to udisks2 is what initially caused my problem. Rather than reverting to the udisks1 behavior, I found a way to use the new default behavior to my advantage.\nThe key to the solution is that both of the following mounts (for the same device) can co-exist: \n\n\n*\n\n*/media/myusername/Backup \n\n*/media/root/Backup\n\n\nTherefore, if I change my backup scripts to use /media/root/Backup and to always mount the device at that location before the backup, my issue is solved. I can continue to use Dolphin the way I do now and I can live with the default (non-root) mount location of /media/myusername/Backup. They do not appear to conflict with each other.\nI was striving to avoid having two mounts for one device, but after testing this option I find that it seems to work fine. It solves the backup problems I was seeing.\nUnless anyone knows of problems from this approach it may be my preferred approach because it doesn't change the new default behavior, it doesn't rely on any scripts (which always require maintenance over time) and it assures that my backup will not fail due to the device not being mounted.\n\nA: It sounds like you have a leftover mount folder that didn't get deleted properly. With the drive unplugged, run this command from the terminal:\nsudo rmdir /media/Backup\nNext time you connect your external hard drive, it should mount to the new place. Note that newer versions of Ubuntu will mount to /media/username/Backup instead of /media/Backup\n\nA: you can add an entry for the HDD/Partitions in /etc/fstab then it will always be mounted as you need it to.\nFor more info look on this documentation.\n\nA: I think the best approach may be this script originating from a SuperUser discussion:\nhttps://github.com/fatso83/Code-Snippets/tree/master/system-utils/ubuntu/automount\nI like this approach because it has been debugged and tested fairly extensively (and is known to work on the version of Ubuntu I'm running).\nFurthermore, I share the sentiment of the original questioner at SuperUser:\n\nI don't want to have to enter all the data into fstab, partially because it's tedious and annoying, but mostly because I can't predict what I'll be plugging into it or how the partitions will change in the future.\n\nHere's the readme file for the set of scripts:\nAuto-mount and unmount usb disks based on disk labels\nThese scripts are basically ripped from several answers on StackOverflow. The information was spread over several answers, and some were a bit outdated, so I tried to compile all the information and put it here.\nThe scripts have been found to be working on Ubuntu 10.10 and 12.04.2 LTS If they do not work for you, try to see if there are tips in the original SO discussion (see below). You can then pass me that info, and maybe I will integrate it into a specific patch.\nAll scripts are to be put in /usr/local/sbin\nThe udev rules are to be put in /etc/udev/rules.d/\nFor reference, all info was ripped from here.\n", "Q: Installing glib gives \"You must have either have gettext support\" I'm trying to install glib-2.37.6 (also same problem with glib-2.32.1) and getting this error during configuration:\n\nYou must have either have gettext support in your C library, or use the\n  GNU gettext library. (http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html\n\nI previously built gettext, though.  To clarify, I'm trying to build a number of things (leading up to gtk+) without actually installing in the usual places, since this is a machine others use; instead, I'm using --prefix= to put everything in a work directory under my home directory.\nI tried looking at the logs to see if I could get a clue about whether I needed to set anything else.  I also tried looking at the configure script, although I'm not an expert on autoconf.  What I found was that the error occurred because gt_cv_have_gettext wasn't set to yes.  So then I looked for where it was supposed to get set, so that I could tell what file or whatever it was checking for.  But unless I'm missing something, the only command that would set it to yes is underneath this if:\n  if test \"$gt_cv_func_dgettext_libc\" != \"yes\" \\\n     || test \"$gt_cv_func_ngettext_libc\" != \"yes\" \\\n     || test \"$ac_cv_func_bind_textdomain_codeset\" != \"yes\" ; then\n\nThe config.log (looking at the configure line numbers) indicates that the condition was false, so everything inside (including the command to set gt_cv_have_gettext) was skipped.  But the test seems to check that none of three things are missing.  And none of them are; here's one of the last segments of config.log right before the error:\nconfigure:7982: checking for ngettext in libc\nconfigure:8000: gcc -o conftest -g -O2   conftest.c  >&5\nconfigure:8000: $? = 0\nconfigure:8009: result: yes\nconfigure:8013: checking for dgettext in libc\nconfigure:8031: gcc -o conftest -g -O2   conftest.c  >&5\nconfigure:8031: $? = 0\nconfigure:8040: result: yes\nconfigure:8047: checking for bind_textdomain_codeset\nconfigure:8047: gcc -o conftest -g -O2   conftest.c  >&5\nconfigure:8047: $? = 0\nconfigure:8047: result: yes\nconfigure:8323: checking for msgfmt\n\n(The line that would set gt_cv_have_gettext is somewhere between 8047 and 8323.)  So unless I'm missing something, it looks as though if all these three things--ngettext, dgettext, bind_textdomain_codeset--are present (or succeed, or something), then an error will result.\nSo what am I missing?  Is there some other option that needs to be set, or something else wrong with my configuration?  Or did I find an error in the configure script?  Thanks for any help.  I wanted to ask in a forum like this before submitting it as a bug report.\n\nA: OK, I think I figured it out.  Since I was \"installing\" everything in a directory under my home directory, I needed to add the \"bin\" subdirectory of the --prefix directory to my $PATH before running configure.  That made it find msgfmt and, I think, got it around the error.\n\nA: how to add the \"bin\" subdirectory of the --prefix directory to my $PATH before running configure.

I want to be able to use some programs that depend on KDE, such as Krita and Kdenlive, but I don't want to have to install the KDM.\nIf I install Krita on Ubuntu, I suffer many problems trying to open it.  Looking at the terminal output, it seems they are related to some missing KDE folders or something like that.\nIs it possible to install the KDE directories hierarchy without need to install the entire KDE Plasma Desktop?\n\nA: The thing about KDE is that if you try to install a component of the desktop, such as Krita, it will require, and thus depend on and automatically install, all (or most) of the base KDE programs. It's a very centralized software. When you install all the KDE desktop packages, however, the most harm they will cause is taking a lot of disk space.

New to Linux/Ubuntu! Does it have anything to do with the 32/64 thing and what is that?\n\nA: 12.04 is a Long Term Service (LTS) release, meaning that it is a stable version for which you will get package updates for a long period. By default you'll only get a notice for a release upgrade when a new LTS comes out; that will be 14.04, btw.\nIf you want to upgrade already to one of the intermediate releases the easiest way to do it is using the upgrade manager GUI. This guide walks you through the process. \nThe 32/64 bit thing refers to the CPU architecture, you can read more details at Wikipaedia, but in essence you have operating systems for both architectures.

Make sure that the path is something like this:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\n\nSave and close the file with Ctrl+X and press Y when you are asked.\nSee also: How to add a directory to the PATH?\n\nA: I got the problem and fixed it by editing my .bashrc file\n\n*\n\n*Open up your .bashrc file using nano\n$ nano ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n*Add the following line to the .bashrc file\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:   /usr/local/games\"\n\n\n\n*Press Ctrl+X to save the file\n\n\n*It will ask to chnage the file, press y and Enter.\nYou're done.\n\nA: When you want to add a new value to the PATH system variable, you most likely add a new line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile files.\nFor example, if you want to add /opt/netbeans/bin to PATH, you must add this line to the end of ~/.bashrc file:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/netbeans/bin\n\nLet's break this line down.\n\n\n*\n\n*export PATH - Here we refer to the PATH variable\n\n*= - We want to assign it a new value using the = operator\n     (The rest of the string is the value that will be stored in the PATH)\n\n*$PATH - We assign the variable PATH to the value that was in the variable before the current command\n\n*: - We add a separator for the new value\n\n*/opt/netbeans/bin - And add a new value to the PATH\n\nYou must see all of your refers to the PATH variable in the ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile files and make sure that you expand -\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/netbeans/bin\n\nand not overwrite like this -\nexport PATH=/opt/netbeans/bin\n\nthe PATH variable\nYou must make sure, in every reference to the PATH you use $PATH: and your additional value after it\n\nIf it doesn't work, you may do something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure, there is something like the next variable in /etc/environment file and it never redefined in this file:\n\n\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Add missing paths from the above PATH variable to your PATH variable located in the /etc/environment\n\nBefore testing after each change in files don't remember to update your configs.\nFor example for ~/.bashrc file:\nsource `~/.bashrc`\n\n\nA: This is an old thread but I got here following the same problem.\nIn my case I most likely accidently edited a line in the ~/.bashrc file.\nBy fixing the following line to appear as in the picture it solved my problem:\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/V3vq0.png\n(mine had the ':' in the wrong place).\nI don't think there is a need to add a line, just make sure the line with the PATH is correct(unless you also have your own scripts saved somewhere).\nIn order to get to the ~/.bashrc you can either use graphical methods (make sure to show hidden files) and go to the home folder.\nOR -\nuse\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin\nto enable some commands temporarily as was suggested here earlier, then open ~/.bashrc using\nnano ~./bashrc\n\n", "Q: Rcmdr in R 3.0.1 asks to install rgl package everyime I open Rcmdr I have installed R 3.0.1 in my Ubuntu 12.04 Laptop.\n\nI started R as root by sudo R, then installed Rcmdr package by the following command:\ninstall.packages(\"Rcmdr\", dependencies = TRUE)\nbut everytime I run Rcmdr by library(Rcmdr), it says that the package rgl is not installed, and asks to install it.\nI do, but next time when I run Rcmdr, it again asks to install rgl. What should I do?\n\nA: Found a solution. Downloaded the rgl package and kept the folder in the location where Rmdr folder is. Now Rcmdr isn't asking for installation of the rgl package anymore.\n", "Q: timezone change resets after reboot ubuntu 11.10 I am trying to change my timezone from HKT to JST or any other timezone for that using the most commonly used command that I can find sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata.\nThis successfully changes the timezone to JST. But upon reboot it reverts to HKT.\nI cannot seem to find any solid answers to this other than use sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata?\nThanks in Advance.\n\nA: I don't think reconfiguring the tzdata is the right thing to do.\nOn my system, I've set the timezone by right clicking on the time in the window manager and selecting 'Time and Date Settings'.\nThere is also a file /etc/timezone -- edit that with the right information -- Asia/Tokyo, I think.\nThe other thing is to make sure /etc/localtime is hard linked to the right file under /usr/share/zoneinfo/, probably /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Tokyo .\n", "Q: Gmail text not appearing in Firefox On Ubuntu, I was working with a single user till yesterday. The GMail chat app was working on Firefox. \nThis morning, I installed Google Chrome, created a parallel user as an administrator, and logged into the parallel user. \nLo and behold, everytime I log in to google related sites, there is no font or character being displayed. I checked this on chrome, and texts are intact! \nTo be sure, I deleted the ./mozilla folder in the home directory, but the problem persists.  \nWhat is the reason that this would be happening?\n\nA: In all likelihood the way you installed Chrome messed up some font used by Firefox. Google Chrome is not officially supported on Ubuntu, not available from the official repositories and no automatic updates are released for it. You should have installed Chromium instead; you'll find it in the Software Centre.\n", "Q: How to quickly extract all kinds of archived files from command-line? Many times I need to extract different kinds of archived files using commad-line. But not all the time I remember the exact command for any type of file archive.

This is the download page for the BIOS updates. I am currently at BIOS update 216. Should do all the updates or just do the newest one? And what program should I use to do this? \n\nA: Before we go through the potentially harmful process of a BIOS upgrade we have to answer the following questions with yes:\n\n*\n\n*Do I really need the improvements the new BIOS version offers?\n\n*Had I made a full backup of my data?\n\nYou may find that a newer BIOS will not really add any better performance to our exisiting and running system.\nIn case we suffer from a BIOS bug that was resolved, and we need the BIOS to be upgraded we then need to know which OS is supported.\n\n*\n\n*Some mainboard BIOS have the capability to upgrade from USB without the need of an additional operating system.\n\n*Few manufacturers even offer a Linux software to perform the flash upgrade.\n\nBoth sadly seems not to be the case for your ASUS notebook. We are offered various versions of the Windows software to upgrade our flash memory. This software may run with a repair Windows CD (see this answer for details) but the better way to go here is to use the DOS utility allflash2 which is also available for download from ASUS. This utility can be run after booting FreeDOS. How to do this was further elaborated in an answer to the following questions:\n\n*\n\n*How to create DOS Boot USB flash drive with (X)Ubuntu\n\n*How to flash a BIOS when only a Windows binary is provided?\nObvious notes in addition:\n\n*\n\n*Do not flash BIOS from Wine.\n\n*Flashing BIOS from a virtual machine is not possible.\n\n\nA: You can update your BIOS using a DOS.\nThere is a FreeDOS operating system which is DOS compatible.\nI have successfully updates many ASUS notebooks this way.\n", "Q: Problem with skyrim!

If one installs Ubuntu 12.04, and does a distribution upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04, does the upgraded version still have five-year Long Term Support?\n\nA: No, 13.04 is not LTS.\nYou cannot directly upgrade 12.04 to 13.04. You can upgrade 12.04 LTS to 12.10, and then upgrade 12.10 to 13.04. Both 12.10 and 13.04 are non-LTS.\nUbuntu non-LTS have historically been supported for 18 months. New non-LTS will be supported for 9 months. For example, 12.10 is supported until April 2014 (18 months since October 2012). 13.04 it is supported until January 2014 (9 months since April 2014).\nSource: Releases - Ubuntu Wiki\nAbout NKN's comment: note that upgrade has two distinct meanings:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can upgrade 12.04.* to 12.04.3, in the sense that you will have\nup-to-date packages for the 12.04 series. This is done by apt-get dist-upgrade\n(allows apt-get to install new dependencies if necessary) or apt-get upgrade\n(does not allow apt-get to install new\ndependencies).\n\n*You can upgrade 12.04.* to 12.10, so that you will have packages for the 12.10 series. This is done by do-release-upgrade.\n\n\nA: Simple answer: No.\nBy upgrading a LTS release to a non-LTS release we will have the support time scheduled for the upgraded release only. For 13.04 this will be support until January 2014.\nWe will however be able to upgrade 12.04 LTS to the next 14.04 LTS version after it was released in April 2014.\n", "Q: Virtual Box guest (Windows7) in Ubuntu 12.04 (host) not connecting to the internet I have an Virtual Box running Win7 inside an Ubuntu host.

I assume that happened with your config.\n\nIn your Apache configuration you used the VirtualHost directive in a possibly problematic way. You stated the domain name in it, e. g. <VirtualHost restaurant.local>. But this is discouraged in favor of stating the servers IP address. The domain name(s) get defined inside the VirtualHost block, for example with ServerName or ServerAlias.\nIn the VirtualHost directive, you can state the IP address you want to your virtual host to listen at, plus the port:\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>\n\nThis virtual host definition only gets applied if a client (in most cases, a web browser) connects to IP 127.0.0.1 on port 80. Because 127.0.0.1 is (in almost every case) the internal loopback device, this virtual host can only be reached from the server itself. Of course, on public servers you would rather use a public IP address.\nIf you want to apply a virtual host definition to any IP (that reaches the server on the network level), you can use the * wildcard, for example:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n\n", "Q: How to install Apache Tomcat in Ubuntu?

The obvious difference is that greek uses 'comma' as a decimal separator and that mixes google earth somehow.\nI am not sure if this is a bug on google-earth's code (since this error does not show up in,say, windows OS) or in ubuntu. But they should probably be notified.\n\nA: With google-earth-pro-stable-7.3.2.5776-0.x86_64, I use LC_NUMERIC=C to fix the problem while keeping the language of the application unchanged.\nYou can run:\nLC_NUMERIC=C google-earth-pro\n\nor edit /opt/google/earth/pro/googleearth to add this just after the header of file :\nexport LC_NUMERIC=C\n\n\nA: This solution worked for me:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/googleearth-package/+bug/1160289\nThese are the instructions I followed:\n\"I created a script and named it \"earth.sh\" (without the quotes).\n  sudo gedit earth.sh\n\nand placed the following lines inside it:\n #!/bin/bash\n LANG=en_US google-earth\n\nThen I placed said script inside /opt/google/earth/free:\n sudo cp earth.sh /opt/google/earth/free\n\nThen I opened /usr/share/applications/google-earth.desktop:\n sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/google-earth.desktop\n\nand changed the \"exec\" command to \"/opt/google/earth/free/earth.sh\".\nNow google earth opens and the search function works ok even if the language is not US english.\"\nDefinitively its an issue with the regional settings.\n\nA: Between the last line starting with a # and FindPath(), insert LANG=en_US and save \nit works just fine on my Lubuntu 18.04 / Google Earth Pro 7.3.1.4507 (64-bit) with Swedish locale.

Our plan is to run a dual-boot system with Ubuntu and Windows 7 or 8.\nI've setup a few of these systems so I know the how of it, installing Windows first, shrinking the partition etc. \nWhat I can't seem to find, despite reading many topics about the subject, is a way to determine the ideal partition layout.\nAt home I have a 320gb disk divided roughly in 200gb for Win, 10gb swap, and the rest for Ubuntu itself. I've seen no need to make a shared partition for both systems so I just gave both more then enough to work on their own. \nAt work we've only got a 128gb SSD to work with and we absolutely need some kind of shared space since we'll be running both windows and ubuntu for developing and testing sites and apps. \nNow I know Ubuntu kan run find on less than 20gb, less than 10gb even. \nThe system will have 16GB of ram, so I suppose the swap partition should be about the same size for hibernation purposes, probably somewhat smaller.\nWindows is a disk hogger usually, but I can set most of the paths to the remaining partitions so that would help a lot. Would 20gb suffice in that case ?\nSo that would leave me with 20gb Ubuntu, 16gb swap, 20gb Win and about 72gb for shared storage.\nBut I'm not sure if this is the best division. I would probably need to install most of the windows applications on the 72gb partition. Perhaps even the larger Ubuntu apps, not sure. \nAnd what format would I use for the 72gb ? I suppose NTFS since that's fastest for windows and ubuntu can work with it. Are there any performance issues for Ubuntu in this case ? \nI'd love to hear your thoughts about this.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: If this is part of a wide-ranging update, perhaps a centralised file server with some redundancy might be in order. There are many systems and protocols that work for both Windows and Linux and will provide next-to-native performance (if not better).\nThat would leave all important stuff off the SSDs and free for applications and swap. It's more costly (probably the cost of a few computers on its own) but it offers clear benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*File collaboration between many people,\n\n*Adding external network access (if desirable), and \n\n*Backing things up is now much, much easier.\n\n\nA: I have previously had a shared NTFS partition for shared data, but in my use the size requirement was actually quite low. I had allocated 20 Gb for the shared partition, but I was using less than 1 Gb.\nIf you actually work on something large, like video files, then you may need a larger shared partition. But in my experience most of the hard disk space is taken by additional installed applications, both in Windows and in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Would recommend at least 30 gb for Windows (base install takes 16-20gb, if you update, may need more, would also need to disable swap file on windows partition, takes 3-4 gb, instead enable it on the ntfs drive, hibernation also takes 2-3 gb),\n 16 gb for Ubuntu, 4gb Swap , and rest as ntfs for data, which can be shared with both Windows and Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Notification icon for wireless connection when using /etc/network/interfaces I have modified /etc/network/interfaces in order to connect to my wireless network automatically on startup. \nMy question: Is there a way, to put a notification icon on the top panel to confirm that the computer is connected.\nNow the only icon is the one of nm which is being bypassed so is not useful.\nThanks.\n\nA: You can tell nm to include any interfaces that you defined in /etc/network/interfaces by editing its configuration file\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nand changing managed=false to managed=true in the [ifupdown] section\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=true\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to edit/tweak the regional settings?

My laptop has a Synaptics touchpad with multi-touch support. Kinetic two-finger scrolling works fine on windows, how can I get it to work on ubuntu?\nI have already reversed the scrolling direction by editing the /usr/share/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf, all I need now is to give it some inertia.\nI am using the 32 bit version of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nThis link explains a lot about the different parameters, but I can't seem to find the right parameters to set in order to achieve this. Please do not answer unless you have tried this before. Thank you :)\n\nA: Kinetic two-finger scrolling is called \"conventional coasting\" in the Synaptics driver:\n\nCoasting comes in two flavors: conventional (finger off) coasting, and corner (finger on) coasting. Conventional coasting is enabled when coasting is enabled, and CornerCoasting is set to false. [Synaptics manpage]\n\nThe two modes are mutually exclusive: kinetic two-finger scrolling does not work with corner coasting enabled. So let's enable conventional coasting. As per the new Ubuntu recommendations in the file, do not edit your 50-synaptics.conf directly but create a directory /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and in it a file like 51-synaptics-tweaks.conf, containing:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        Option \"CornerCoasting\" \"0\"\n        Option \"CoastingSpeed\" \"20\"\n        Option \"CoastingFriction\" \"50\"\nEndSection\n\nTo see the effect, restart X.\nAs you noticed, the speed and friction values are hardware dependent. What works on one touchpad might not have a noticable effect on another. Some experimentation might be needed.\nFor experiments, it is better to use synclient, as it creates an immediate (but non-permanent) effect without having to restart X all the time. The equivalent to the above would be:\nsynclient CornerCoasting=0 CoastingSpeed=20 CoastingFriction=50\n\n\nA: In Linux kinetic scrolling  is called \"Coasting\", at least in the Synaptics driver.\nYou can do it by adding  following option lines to the file 50-synaptics.conf file, adapting the values as you require:\n# Coasting configuration\nOption \"CornerCoasting\" \"0\"\nOption \"CoastingSpeed\" \"20\"\nOption \"CoastingFriction\" \"50\"\n\n", "Q: How to know what version of PHP is shipped in a release version?

Although we use metric for just about everything (distance, temperature, and measurements), we use American paper sizes (8-1/2 x 11, 11 x 14, and 11 x 17). By default, the locale settings in Linux for en-CA assume metric paper, so that every individual program needs to have the default paper sizes manually adjusted. This is annoying.\nThe second is currency format, which is currently set as $20457.99. The correct format is $20,457.99.\nI haven't tested fr-CA, but I am suspecting similar issues. They also use American paper size by default and their currency format is 20 457,99$.\nTwo questions:\n1. How can I change these two items on my installation? I have Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop AMD64 installed.\n2. How do I go about proposing a change so that this can be incorporated into the core Linux product? I'm just an end-user, but this might be a small contribution.\nThanks,\n\n\nA: 1- You can change your locale settings by editing /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_CA and then applying the changes:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_CA\nsudo locale-gen en_CA.utf8\n\n2- You might find contact information in the file.\n\nA: As regards paper size, it's correct in the English-Canadian locale already. However, in Ubuntu 12.04 that setting is not always effective (the problem has been fixed in 13.04). To fix it on your installation you can run the command\n\nsudo paperconfig -p letter\n\nTo change the currency format on your system, you may want to edit the locale specification file as suggested by @Jean-Marie.\nIf you are sure about the currency format, please file a bug at http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=glibc\nHowever, they won't likely change it just because you ask them... You need to point at authoritative sources to convince them that you are right and the current locale specification wrong. ;-)\n", "Q: Automatically enter input in command line I'm running a script that it requests entering 'y' on each operation, I am looking for a solution like $ ./script < echo 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyy' to pass all my inputs in one time.\n\nA: In the shell script you can also use the following trick of spawn, expect and send\nspawn script.sh\nexpect \"Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\"\nsend \"yes\"\n\nHowever in the above scenerio you will have to give the phrase you are expecting to get while you execute the script for more examples go to the following link\nExpect within Bash\n\nA: There is a command created specifically for that case: yes\n$ yes | ./script\n\nWhat this does is connect the output of yes to the input of ./script. So when ./script asks for user input it will instead get the output of yes. The output of yes is an endless stream of y followed by enter. So basically as if the user is entering y for every question of ./script.\nIf you want to say no (n) instead of yes (y) you can do it like this:\n$ yes n | ./script\n\nNote that some tools have an option to always asume yes as answer. See here for example: Bypass the yes/no prompt in 'apt-get upgrade'\n\nOther methods to enter input:\nIf you know exactly how many y your script is expecting you can do it like this:\n$ printf 'y\\ny\\ny\\n' | ./script\n\nThe newlines (\\n) are the enter keys.\nUsing printf instead of yes you have more fine grained control of input:\n$ printf 'yes\\nno\\nmaybe\\n' | ./script\n\nNote that in some rare cases the command does not require the user to press enter after the character. in that case leave the newlines out:\n$ printf 'yyy' | ./script\n\nFor sake of completeness you can also use a here document:\n$ ./script << EOF\ny\ny\ny\nEOF\n\nOr if your shell supports it a here string:\n$ ./script <<< \"y\ny\ny\n\"\n\nOr you can create a file with one input per line:\n$ ./script < inputfile\n\nIf the command is sufficiently complex and the methods above no longer suffice then you can use expect.\nHere is an example of a super simple expect script:\nspawn ./script\nexpect \"are you sure?\"\nsend \"yes\\r\"\nexpect \"are you really sure?\"\nsend \"YES!\\r\"\nexpect eof\n\n\nTechnical nitpick:\nThe hypothetical command invocation you gave in your question does not work:\n$ ./script < echo 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyy'\nbash: echo: No such file or directory\n\nThis is because the shell grammar allows a redirect operator anywhere in the command line. As far as the shell is concerned your hypothetical command line is the same as this line:\n$ ./script 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyy' < echo\nbash: echo: No such file or directory\n\nThat means ./script will be called with the argument 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyy' and the stdin will get input from a file named echo. And bash complains since the file does not exists.\n\nA: You can supply user input to your script with cat, from a text file, piped to your script with bash like this: \ncat input.txt | bash your_script.sh\n\nJust put your desired user input into your input.txt file, whatever answers you want - y, n, digits, strings, etc.\n\nA: Okay, this may not be a very elegant solution but if you write your options in a separate file and then pass it as an input to the script, it would work as well. So if you create a new file with all your options (call this file as 'options.in'), then you can easily run your script with ./script.sh < options.in and edit/create different options files as suitable. \n\nA: I was writing a bash script with Dialog and needed this to happen automatically also. I did this and it worked like a charm.\n# -Wy force signaturewipe (if exists)\necho \"y\" | sudo lvcreate -W y -n $lvName -L \"$lvSize\"G /dev/\"$svg\" >> $nfsUtilLog\n\n\nA: Use the command yes:\nyes | script\n\nExcerpt from the man page:\nNAME\n       yes - output a string repeatedly until killed\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       yes [STRING]...\n       yes OPTION\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Repeatedly output a line with all specified STRING(s), or 'y'.\n\n\nA: Some things (apt-get for example) accept special flags to run in silent mode (and accept defaults). In apt-get's case, you just pass it a -y flag. This does completely depend on your script though.\nIf you need more complicated things, you can wrap your script in an expect script. expect allows you to read output and send input so you can do pretty complicated things that other scripting wouldn't allow. Here's one of the examples from its Wikipedia page:\n# Assume $remote_server, $my_user_id, $my_password, and $my_command were read in earlier\n# in the script.\n# Open a telnet session to a remote server, and wait for a username prompt.\nspawn telnet $remote_server\nexpect \"username:\"\n# Send the username, and then wait for a password prompt.\nsend \"$my_user_id\\r\"\nexpect \"password:\"\n# Send the password, and then wait for a shell prompt.\nsend \"$my_password\\r\"\nexpect \"%\"\n# Send the prebuilt command, and then wait for another shell prompt.\nsend \"$my_command\\r\"\nexpect \"%\"\n# Capture the results of the command into a variable. This can be displayed, or written to disk.\nset results $expect_out(buffer)\n# Exit the telnet session, and wait for a special end-of-file character.\nsend \"exit\\r\"\nexpect eof\n\n\nA: You can write the expect script as follow:\n$ vi login.exp\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nspawn ssh username@machine.IP\nexpect \"*assword: \"\nsend -- \"PASSWORD\\r\"\ninteract\n\nAnd run it as:\n$ expect login.exp\n\n", "Q: What is the path and command of mounted folder when I \"connect to server\"?

I have a Toshiba L875, AMD, with Radeon graphics card. Win8 was pre-installed. There are two problems but I believe one underlying cause.\nProblem: the first is that the display has random gray artifacts. Grey boxes or what look like grey shards of broken glass, randomly appear on screen. Triggering a refresh (resize or move a window) usually removes the artifacts, though they reappear.\nHow I've tried to fix it: \n\n\n*\n\n*Have verified that open source Radeon drivers are in use (Settings > Software & Updates > Additional drivers)\n\n*Have added proprietary ATI drivers (same as above)\n\n*Have added ATI catalyst center\n\n*Added latest kernel, 3.10\n\n*Installed various distros: Mint, Ubuntu 13.04, 12.04 LTS, Lubuntu, all Ubuntu derivatives\n\n*Removed compiz. That was a mistake :)\n\n\nEach of these attempts are separate, not cumulative. \nAdding/changing drivers either had no effect on the problem or, in the case of the proprietary drivers, I had to reinstall Ubuntu, as a reboot ended with a black screen and blinking white cursor that accepted no commands.\nI attempted to remove/change compiz because most Ubuntu reported errors listed /usr/bin/compiz as the location.\nProblem 2: Oh, and my ultimate goal is to get dual monitors working. Any attempts to plug-in a VGA monitor blank the laptop monitor or freeze it.\nCurrently: my attempts are more whack-a-mole than systematic and probably incorrect in some way, but I am not sure what else to do: it seems a video problem. \nA fresh install awaits at home, so the default video drivers and kernel are no longer in-play.\nHowever, I believe what fixes one problem will fix the other.\nI've learned a lot over the 25 or so hours spent researching and trying to resolve the video problem, but I need it to work now. Before I jumped, I used a VM for about a month and set-up a Bitnami WordPress stack as a very good OneNote replacement. So, I checked workflow. And, I could be wrong, but was sure dual monitors worked when I ran the LiveDVD to test for hardware support. Anyway, like the Ham & Egg breakfast story that explains the difference between involved and committed (the chicken is involved, the pig committed), I removed Win 8 and went all-in. So, I am committed.\nThanks for any support, I appreciate the time of those in the forum.\n\nA: I presume you already checked if the card works with windows?\nIf you are really unable to use the proprietary driver, you could try the new open source driver in Linux 3.11. The easiest way would probably be to just install the Ubuntu 13.10 daily image, which includes this kernel.\n\nA: [resolved] I'm going to mark this resolved but unfixed. Lots of research suggests the driver is too new. For future travelers, i can leave a little bit of info that may help shorten the curve.\nUbuntu 13.04 on an earlier model Toshiba, L675D-s7046, worked with dual monitors.\nThe L875D laptop was purchased in May 2013 and I believe the ATI drivers too new for Open source drivers to have yet been developed. Why proprietary drivers did not work, is still unclear.\nSeveral other posts in this site suggest the same situation. This will be one more that confirms that L875 Satellite Open source and proprietary video drivers, do not work in ubuntu 13.04 and 13.10, both 64-bit.\n", "Q: How to Disable the EFI Check in 13.04 x64? I have a Lenovo B575 laptop and the BIOS presents itself as EFI-capable to the 13.04 x64 installer but the laptop will only function as Legacy. Ther are no BIOS/firmware options to toggle/change so I am stuck with this situation and cannot install any OS that does and EFI check; however, I was able to install Windows 8.1 by removing the EFI folder and efibootmanager files from the installation disk and it worked perfectly. I know this is clearly a BIOS issue; however, I have been unable to convince Lenovo to issue a BIOS updates that unlocks the EFI capabilities. The laptop came with Win 7 installed and, since that does not do an EFI check, a Legacy reinstall works perfectly. FYI, here are some of my previous installation test results with x64 installations:\nWindows 7 SP1 - no EFI check, installation OK.\nWindows 8.0 - EFI check, installation fails.\nWindows 8.1 - EFI check, installation fails.\nWindows 8.1 (modified) - Removed EFI check, installation OK.\nZorn 7.0 - installation OK (apparently no EFI check?)\nSo, is there any way the EFI check can be disabled so I can install 13.04 x64 as Legacy?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: First, your language is confusing: \"EFI check\" is not a standard term. To help facilitate communication, here are some definitions (my apologies if this seems pedantic; but it's necessary for clarity):\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS -- The firmware used on most PCs sold between 1983 and 2010. Often used (confusingly) to refer to more recent firmware. Importantly, older boot loaders for DOS, Windows, Linux, and other OSes were written with BIOS in mind.\n\n*EFI or UEFI -- The firmware used on most PCs sold since mid-2011. Among other things, EFI requires a new type of boot loader.\n\n*CSM -- The Compatibility Support Module, which enables an EFI to boot a BIOS-mode boot loader, in much the way that WINE enables Linux to run Windows programs.\n\n*Legacy -- In this context, a synonym for CSM.\n\n\nI suspect that by \"EFI check\" you mean that the computer is favoring the EFI-mode boot loader over the BIOS-mode boot loader. Note that the OS's boot loader doesn't check for the boot mode, as you seem to believe; the firmware checks for boot loaders written for the mode(s) it supports, and selects one based on whatever algorithm it uses and whatever options you as the user have set or select at boot time. It's the firmware that determines the boot mode. The Ubuntu installer can influence this only by presenting BIOS, EFI, or both boot loaders and letting the firmware decide which to use.\nBe aware that EFI-mode booting does offer some advantages over BIOS-mode booting, so you may want to consider using it for both Windows and Linux. Most obviously in the short term, EFI-mode booting is often slightly faster than BIOS-mode booting, so you can shave a few seconds off your boot times by using EFI. EFI-mode boot loaders are also stored as files on the disk rather than as binary blobs written to officially-unallocated disk areas (as BIOS requires), so managing EFI boot loaders is theoretically easier. (In practice, some systems have EFI bugs that negate this advantage.)\nThat said, if you truly want to install your OSes in legacy mode, you can force a legacy-mode boot; however, the details of how to do so vary from one computer and OS to another. Some things you can try include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable BIOS/CSM/legacy support in your firmware setup utility. This is likely to be a requirement, but the details vary greatly from one computer to another. The option name may be non-obvious, and the details of what the option offers vary from one system to another. Thus, I can't be very precise about this; you'll just have to dig into your firmware and experiment.\n\n*Disable EFI support in your firmware setup utility. This is possible in some cases, but usually it's not possible on true EFI-based systems. VirtualBox enables you to completely disable EFI support, but on most PCs, options that users read as disabling EFI-mode booting usually just favor legacy-mode booting rather than completely removing EFI-mode support. Thus, disabling EFI support may be a theoretical possibility, but it's unlikely to be a practical option for you.\n\n*Use your firmware's built-in boot manager to force a BIOS/CSM/legacy boot of your boot medium. The details of how to access the boot manager vary between computers, but it's usually done by hitting a function key (or sometimes Esc) early in the boot process. You may then see a boot menu, and with any luck it will have two options for your boot medium. One will include the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" and the other won't. Select the option that lacks the EFI/UEFI string and it should boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n*Use rEFInd to force a BIOS-mode boot. Download and prepare the USB flash drive image of rEFInd, then mount it and edit the EFI/BOOT/refind.conf file on the disk. Uncomment the scanfor line, remove the optical and external items, and add the cd and biosexternal items. This will cause rEFInd to omit EFI-boot options for external media and add BIOS-boot options for same. Then insert both rEFInd the USB flash drive and your Ubuntu disc and reboot into rEFInd. It should present a boot menu, from which you can select your Ubuntu (which might conceivably be mis-identified or poorly labeled). Note that this will work more reliable with an Ubuntu CD than with an Ubuntu USB flash drive. If you use the latter and it doesn't work, try swapping the two USB flash drives.\n\n*Hack the Ubuntu image to remove the EFI boot loader. This is most easily done from a USB flash drive, so prepare an Ubuntu installer on USB flash drive. You can then remove or rename the EFI directory tree on the USB flash drive and it should stop booting in EFI mode.\n\n\n\nOne more suggestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*At one time there was a special version of Ubuntu for Macs. Ironically, this version lacked EFI support. The idea was to install it in BIOS mode, since EFI-mode installations of Ubuntu on Macs often had problems with hardware initialization. In any event, if this variant is still available, you could try using it.\n\n\nA: No joy on the Mac version either but thank you for the suggestion. Oh well, at least I know I can install Ubuntu v10.4.4 x64 which makes no reference to EFI and it works perfectly. I guess the only thing left for me is to wait and hope for a Lenovo BIOS update to unlock this EFI BIOS. Thanks again!\n", "Q: Why does chkconfig highlight the word \"on\" by default in Precise? Why does chkconfig highlight the word \"on\" by default in Ubuntu Precise?\n\n\nA: Because that's what it does. It's by design, I assume to help people notice.\nFrom man chkconfig, emphasis mine:\n\nList mode prints for each specified service a line that consists of the service name and for runlevels zero to six on or off depending if the service will be started or not. on will be printed  in  bright green if the output is written to a terminal. If the --deps option is given, the names of the services that must be started before this service is appended to  each  line.  The  inetd/xinetd  services  are listed in extra sections.\n\n\nA: chkconfig doesn't just highlight the word on. It highlights the whole table entry, when the entry represents a symbolic link (to a script in /etc/init.d) through which the service is enabled.\nAs you may know, a common way to configure whether a system service starts up automatically or not, and when during system startup it starts, is with symbolic links stored in eight subdirectories of /etc: rc0.d, rc1.d, rc2.d, rc3.d, rc4.d, rc5.d, rc6.d, and rcS.d. Those directories contain symbolic links to scripts in /etc/init.d that start and stop services. The symbolic links' names usually start with S to start a service or K not to start it. chkconfig shows you information about this configuration, and lets you modify it.\nMost of the time when a user runs chkconfig --list, the user wants to see what services are enabled and where they are enabled (i.e., through what symbolic link or links, in what rcX.d directories). Therefore, it makes sense for chkconfig to highlight the entries representing scripts that cause services to be run.\nThese are the entries that contain the word on. But there is nothing special about that word. It's the entries that contain it that are special, because they represent what a user is most often looking for when running chkconfig --list.\nWhat if you want to run chkconfig --list without the highlighting?\nIt doesn't appear that there is any special command-line flag to turn color off. There might be an environment variable to do so. But i believe you can simply run:\nchkconfig --list | cat\n\nI cannot test this at the moment because I don't have an Ubuntu system on which I can currently install chkconfig. But most of the time, programs featuring colored output will automatically detect when standard output is not a terminal, and disable it (since it would often not work properly). By piping the output of chkconfig --list to cat, you prevent stdout from being a terminal, while still seeing the output on your terminal.\n", "Q: How can I disable screen blanking without /etc /X11/xorg.conf on Nvidia Optimus laptop I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, 64 bit, kernel Linux 3.5.0-39-generic, on a system that has an Nvidia GE Force GT 640m / Intel HD graphics 4000 - 1.0 GB graphics processor assembly. In order to get the unity 3d desktop features to work correctly I needed to install bumblebee. The problem this has created is that in order for the desktop effects to work with Optimus laptops you must remove /etc/X11/xorg.conf . If using an Optimus laptop unity 3d will not work until this file is removed after this file has been removed if you replace it the desktop will load into a black screen. The reason I want this file is because without it's having a server layout section containing Option \"BlankTime\" \"0\", Option \"StandbyTime\" \"0\", Option \"SuspendTime\" \"0\", Option \"OffTime\" \"0\" my desktop goes blank every 10 minutes this is very  frustrating when attempting to intake media. \nThis is the relevant data from xset -q\nScreen Saver:\n  prefer blanking:  yes    allow exposures:  yes\n\n  timeout:  600    cycle:  600\n\nDPMS (Energy Star):\n\n  Standby: 0    Suspend: 0    Off: 0\n\n  DPMS is Enabled                     \n\nif anyone would present me with a solution to this that doesn't involve something as inelegant as installing caffeine or writing a script to move the cursor every so often. my satisfaction would be great.\n\nA: I'm just an ArchLinux user passing through, but I think you can get the desired effect by running:\nxset s off\n\nafter X has started.\nxset lets you set many of the same options xorg.conf controls dynamically after X has started. The xset s options all control settings related to the screensaver. See the xset man page for a list of all the various s options, but xset s off should disable the screensaver completely. You can run xset q again to see what settings have been changed. Without Xorg.conf files, I think xset is your best bet for changing those options.\nI'm not sure of the best way to automate xset being run in Ubuntu - possibly you could add it to your ~/.xinitrc file, or maybe a more experienced Ubuntu user can chime in with the canonical way to run commands when the desktop environment starts.\nTechnically these various options for automatically running commands are \"scripts\", but I think you'll agree xset s off is a pretty short one.\n", "Q: How to install cuda 5.5 under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit? How to install CUDA 5.5 under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit?\n\nA: STEP I – Driver installation (if you choose the regular drivers)\nThis section remains almost unchanged. Download the Nvidia drivers for Linux from their website, making sure to select 32 or 64-bit Linux based on your system.\nMake sure the requisite tools are installed using the following command -\nsudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev\n\nNext, blacklist the required modules (so that they don’t interfere with the driver installation) -\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAdd the following lines to the end of the file, one per line, and save it when done -\nblacklist amd76x_edac\nblacklist vga16fb\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist rivafb\nblacklist nvidiafb\nblacklist rivatv\n\nIn order to get rid of any nVidia residuals, run the following command in a terminal -\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\n\nThis may take a while, so be patient. Once it’s done, reboot your machine. At the login screen, don’t login just yet. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a text-based login, and switch to the directory which contains the downloaded driver. Run the following commands -\nsudo service lightdm stop\nchmod +x NVIDIA*.run\n\nwhere NVIDIA*.run is the full name of your driver. Next, start the installation with -\nsudo ./NVIDIA*.run\n\nFollow the onscreen instructions. If the installer throws up an error about nouveau still running, allow it to create a blacklist for nouveau, quit the installation and reboot. In that case, run the following commands again -\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo ./NVIDIA*.run\n\nThe installation should now proceed smoothly. When it asks you if you want the 32-bit libraries and if you want it to edit xorg.conf to use these drivers by default, allow both.\nReboot once the installation completes.\nSTEP II – CUDA toolkit installation\nDownload the CUDA toolkit (I used the Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit version). Navigate to the directory that contains the downloaded CUDA toolkit package, and run the following command -\nchmod +x cuda*.run\nsudo ./cuda*.run\n\nwhere cuda*.run is the full name of the downloaded CUDA toolkit. Accept the license that appears. Next, choose to install the driver if you’ve not done so already (this is the development version). Installation of the driver will require switching to a text-based shell (Ctrl+Alt+F1), stopping lightdm as detailed in the previous step and running the toolkit installer as superuser. The CUDA 5.0 toolkit installation is compulsory, while that of the included samples isn’t. Allow the installer to proceed with default locations unless you have specific reasons for not doing so. This makes for easier troubleshooting in the future.\nThis process might take a while depending upon your system config. Once it’s done, double check the summary screen to make sure everything is in place. If the installation of the samples fails (which it does more often than not), it’s probably due to one or more missing libraries. In that case, install the required libraries and rerun the installer, choosing to install the samples alone.\nTo make sure the necessary environment variables (PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH) are modified every time you access a terminal, add the requisite lines (from the summary screen) to the end of ~/.bashrc as follows -\n32 bit systems -\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.0/lib\n\n64 bit systems -\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.0/lib64:/lib\n\nThe paths used above will vary based on the install directory you choose for the toolkit. This wraps up the arguably simpler setup (compared to CUDA 4.x for Linux users), although the samples’ installation still suffers from dependency hell.\nSTEP III – CUDA samples installation and troubleshooting\nWhile the installation of the samples should be straightforward (simply run the all in one toolkit installer), it’s often not all that easy. If you’re getting an error similar to “Samples installation failed due to missing libraries – libglut.so not found”, it’s typically because the installer looks for libglut.so and not variants (like libglut.so.3). To fix this, we’ll have to create softlinks so the installer can track down these files.\nDetermine if variants of libglut.so are present as follows -\nsudo find /usr -name libglut\\*\n\nOn my 64-bit installation of Ubuntu 12.04, this output the following text -\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so.3\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so.3.9.0\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.a\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so\n\nNow that a variant of libglut.so (that is, libglut.so.3) has been found, we can create a softlink to it -\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so.3 /usr/lib/libglut.so\n\nNext, rerun the all in one installer choosing to install only the samples this time around. That should fix the “Missing libraries” error that cropped up previously.\nFurther reading resources can be found here if you’re looking for books on CUDA and GPGPU programming in general.\nCredit goes Here\n\nA: Prerequisites :\n\n\n*\n\n*2 files:\ncuda-repo-ubuntu1204_5.5-0_amd64.deb - 80 KB\ncuda_5.5.22_linux_64.run - 900Mb\n\nThese files are found in Nvidia Website under CUDA category.\nI have downloaded for Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit, download according to your OS specification\nThe .run file is the setup which has\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia Drivers\n\n*Cuda Tool-kit\n\n*Cuda Samples\n\n\nCopy these files in Ubuntu Machine to the /home/<user>/Downloads directory.\n\n*In Ubuntu Machine, configure network and run the command in terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nReboot the machine.\nOpen terminal and browse to the downloaded files location\n\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1204_5.5-0_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get update\n\nWe need to disable the GUI, for that:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nThe screen goes to terminal mode , enter Ctrl+Alt+F1.

Is it possible to use the public-gpg-key import feature of apt-add-repository with my own reprepro repository? Is there e.g. something like a default key server where apt-add-repository expects to find the keys or a path within the (http) repository where it will look for it?\n\nA: If you are asking about whether add-apt-repository will work with your own repo that you host yourself rather than on Launchpad, the answer is \"No\", and with good reason.\nThe add-apt-repository tool provides a cryptographically strong trust relationship to valid Launchpad PPAs. What it can't guarantee is that you should trust the Launchpad users who have upload access to a given PPA, but it still provides a good audit trail and a guarantee that packages at least come from the claimed PPA.\nIf what you were asking for was possible, it would have no trust guarantee at all and would be more or less equivalent to Windows users downloading random things from random websites at random moments in time.\nIs there a good reason why you need to use your own repo, why you can't use a PPA?\n\nA: Both apt-add-repository and add-apt-repository have a -k option you can use to specify your own public keyring repository. apt-key can add the fingerprint of the key you control and trust. Of course you can simply add a public key to the keyserver.ubuntu.com or other keyserver rather than using your own keyserver, but apt still must be told they key fingerprints. See Saji89's helpful answer about apt-key at https://askubuntu.com/a/217529/63886 (and vote it up if it proves useful to you).\nYou can also use medibuntu's approach as automation if many computers are involved.

The --allow-unauthenticated is how you avoid the chicken and egg problem.\nsudo apt-get --quiet update\nUpdates apt again.\nThen application data and debugging hooks packages are added for their applications.\nYou can browse their repo http://packages.medibuntu.org/ to see how their packages do the job.\n", "Q: What happen when Ubuntu is repeatedly shutdown and restarted? I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my system dual boot with XP . My computer teacher at school used to tell that if a linux system is shutdown repeatedly it corrupts. I wanted to know that does same thing happen when it is done in ubuntu.\nThank you.\n\nA: If it's a clean shutdown, thats is not correct.\nIf you just cut the system of any power source, that might corrupt it depending on which filesystem you use.\n\nA: Either your teacher was mis-informed, or the comment was used in a different context than you remember. In a controlled shutdown, the chances of any type of damage or corruption is extremely small. It is during forced, hard shutdowns that the chance of damage occurs - usually to open files and to the disk directory structure. This is applicable to any OS, not just Linux-based systems.\n\nA: My kids shutdown Ubuntu by unplugging it about 50 time a day, and nothing happened so far.  They also sometimes press the power button, to shut it down, and nothing so far.\nNo keep in mind that this be the case here, and doesn't mean that it safe all the time.  From a professional point of view, eventually I will have to re-install, because the system is so corrupted, that's the only way to fix it.\nAs I'm typing this, one of them shutdown the laptop 5 times, by unplugging the cable, and Ubuntu just came back up, and she continued playing.\n\nA: Ubuntus default file systems are robust so there is little chance of corruption.

How can I use rsync with passphrases?\nAll googled \"solutions\" i found use passphrase-less keys which seems no real option.\ni am runnning 2 ubuntu servers 12.04.2 LTS.\n\nA: If you're using rsync with a regular user, ssh-agent may be what you are looking for.\nIf ran into this problem while using rsync in a cron job. Cron jobs are run by the user cron in a restricted environement (some env var like SSH_AUTH_SOCK are missing, so ssh-agent does not work).\nA walkthrough is to use keychain.

This should get GRUB up and running with Windows detected. The trick is forcing an EFI-mode boot of a live CD. You may need to play with your firmware's boot options. Typically, hitting a function key (which one varies) produces a boot menu, and you should select the one for your live CD that mentions \"EFI\" or \"UEFI.\"\n\n*Download the CD-R or USB flash drive image of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a medium with it.

But Its menu buttons are not stylized according to the theme I have chosen (Clearlooks). This issue also appears on some other programs, what can I do to prevent this?\nAddition: It looks like it is the default theme\n\nA: Clearlooks is only for gtk2. Check for a theme that provides for both gtk2 and gtk3 themes. For example, the default theme, lubuntu-default, has subfolders for both gtk2 and gtk3 in /usr/share/themes/Lubuntu-default. Gnome-terminal is a gtk3 app.\nYou can install other themes from the software center that provide both gtk2 and gtk3 themes: try the light-themes or shimmer-themes packages, for example.\n\nA: If your selected theme not  having icon for gnome terminal then it will be blank. So what I am suggesting is set proper icon theme for your lubuntu. Ubuntu tweak tool you needed. That will help you to choose your icons theme. \nTerminal Commands to install Ubuntu tweak too\nl \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak-tool\n", "Q: No access to ubuntu after restarting I have windows 8 pre-installed on my laptop. I downloaded ubuntu 12.04LS and installed it with wubi installer.But on restarting  windows 8 is loaded directly and I cant get access to ubuntu... will anyone please help me??\n\nA: I think this is the problem with UEFI. as you have win8 preinstalled, your system must have UEFI enabled and the secure boot prevents the ubuntu to handle the boot manager. most of times the problem solves with boo-repair. simply goto https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair . I prefer 2nd option in that page. install boot-repair in live ubuntu boot and repair the boot manager.\n", "Q: Cant boot from USB \nI tried to install ubuntu alongside with Windows 8, but for some reason, it just deleted the W8 installation. But now, i want windows back, because Wine cant emulate all programs, which is, of course, to be expected. BUT: Even though i created the USB key with WinUSB (http://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/winusb-create-bootable-windows-installer-usb-in-ubuntu-linux/) my computer won't boot from it! I have changed the boot order, tried to use boot menu, but i am all out of ideas :(\nThe USB key is a Kingston DataTraveller 32GB USB3, formatted as NTFS and all the windows files on it (Note, i am trying to install Windows 7), so i don't understand where it went wrong.\nI hope you guys/girls have some ideas :)\nJonas Strand\n\nA: Are you sure the Ubuntu install deleted Win8? When installing alongside an existing Windows, it should not touch Windows at all. It might just be a grub issue. In a terminal, type sudo update-grub then reboot. You should see an entry for your Win8.\nIf, in fact, the Ubuntu installer DID remove your Win8, and you have to reinstall Windows via USB, your USB stick has to be formatted as Fat32, not NTFS.\n", "Q: What does \"{} \\;\" mean in the find command? Sometimes I see the following command: \nfind . -name  * -exec ls -a {} \\;\n\nI was asked to execute this.\nWhat does {} \\; mean here?\n\nA: If you run find with exec, {} expands to the filename of each file or directory found with find (so that ls in your example gets every found filename as an argument - note that it calls ls or whatever other command you specify once for each file found). \nSemicolon ; ends the command executed by exec. It needs to be escaped with \\ so that the shell you run find inside does not treat it as its own special character, but rather passes it to find.\nSee this article for some more details.\n\nAlso, find provides some optimization with exec cmd {} + - when run like that, find appends found files to the end of the command rather than invoking it once per file (so that the command is run only once, if possible).\nThe difference in behavior (if not in efficiency) is easily noticeable if run with ls, e.g.\nfind ~ -iname '*.jpg' -exec ls {} \\;\n# vs\nfind ~ -iname '*.jpg' -exec ls {} +\n\nAssuming you have some jpg files (with short enough paths), the result is one line per file in first case and standard ls behavior of displaying files in columns for the latter.\n\nA: From the manpage for the find command :\n-exec command ;\n              Execute  command;  true if 0 status is returned.  All following arguments to find are taken to be arguments to\n              the command until an argument consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced  by  the  current\n              file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just in arguments where it\n              is alone, as in some versions of find.  Both of these constructions might need to be escaped (with a  `\\')  or\n              quoted  to  protect them from expansion by the shell.\n\nSo here's the explanation:\n{} means \"the output of find\". As in, \"whatever find found\". find returns the path of the file you're looking for, right? So {} replaces it; it's a placeholder for each file that the find command locates (taken from here).\nThe \\; part is basically telling find \"okay, I'm done with the command I wanted to execute\".\nExample:\nLet's say I'm in a directory full of .txt files. I then run:\nfind . -name  '*.txt' -exec cat {} \\;\n\nThe first part, find . -name  *.txt, returns a list of the .txt files. The second part, -exec cat {} \\; will execute the cat command for every file found by find, so cat file1.txt, cat file2.txt, and so on.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 13.04 second monitor resolution broken after crash I'm using Kubuntu 13.04 with 2 monitors, primary at DVI-0 and the second one at DisplayPort-0. Video card is a Radeon HD 8490. Since it isn't supported by the proprietary drivers, the radeon kernel module is used.\nAfter installing the system both monitors worked fine with a maximum resolution of 1920x1200 @ 60 Hz.

Windows 7 is now expired and I need to put an os on the laptop asap. Will my media be deleted if i use ubuntu as my new os? I have been considering switching to ubuntu it looks nice. \n\nA: I don't think Windows 7 can expire, unless it was never properly activated. \nRegardless, if you install another OS (such as Ubuntu...you will like it) and you choose to replace your old OS, then it will overwrite your hard drive, effectively wiping everything. Depending on the amount of media to be saved, I suggest buying or borrowing an external hard drive and copying everything to it. Then, when you have Ubuntu up and running, you can copy all the media back to the computer.\n\nA: If you select something along the lines of \"Install along existing os\" when installing Ubuntu it shouldn't delete anything.\nBut copying the files somewhere else and then wiping the hard drive by selecting \"replace old os\" on installing Ubuntu is probably the better solution, if Windows isn't working anyway.\n", "Q: Caps lock indicator not synced I have a laptop which I hook up to an external display when I'm at home.

This drive has some very important data on it and I am praying some of you Ubuntu geeks can help me get it back. \nHere's my problem.\nThe HDD is clicking while I am booting, but it stops when I get into Ubuntu or Windows. It refuses to be detected in the bios, so I cant perform any tests on it. I have tried numerous things in both Windows (repair CD, Jumpers, etc.) and Ubuntu (Boot-Fix, GParted, Testdisk, Photorec, forcing a mount, etc.). But it all seems to lead me back to the fact that the drive is not being recognized in the BIOS. I've even tried chilling the drive in the fridge, which worked well for another drive I work on, and I recovered all of the data in Ubuntu flawlessly.\nI am assuming that since the drive stops clicking when I get into the OS' that there is hope for recovery. I am going to try an IDE/SATA to USB cable, and replacing the Logic Board, but I want to exhaust all other possibilities before I do that.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated\nBye\n\nA: Sounds like the clicking is the drive trying to read, then it fails as denoted by the silence. This would be why it is not recognized by anything (BIOS, OS). \nYou may need to bring it to a recovery professional. Continuing to try and get it running could be damaging the platters/erasing data.

It will give you a warning about potentially losing information (which can happen). If you choose to go ahead, it will take some time to resize, depending on the size of the drive.\nThe procedure is pretty straight forward. Gparted kinda walks you though it. \n\nA: \npartition length of 5860530176 sectors exceeds the msdos-partition-table-imposed maximum of 4294967295\n\nYou are using the MBR which has an intrinsic maximum of 4294967295. Wikipedia source:\n\nSince block addresses and sizes are stored in the partition table of an MBR using 32 bits, the maximum size as well as the highest start address of a partition using drives that have 512-byte sectors (actual or emulated) cannot exceed 2 TiB−512 bytes (2,199,023,255,040 bytes or 4,294,967,295 (232−1) sectors × 512 (29) bytes per sector). Alleviating this capacity limitation was one of the prime motivations for the development of the GPT.\n\nHence you must switch to GTP or other kind of a partition table. You can check this question in AskUbuntu for a \"short\" how-to convert your MBR to GTP.\n\nA: I agree with Braiam, with his answer.  I also agree that you need to convert from MBR to GPT, and I have seen a lot of sites that will show you how to convert.  Some of the sites will go as far as saying that the conversion can be done without data loss. \nBelow is a small description of both an MBR, and GPT: \nMBR is the standard partitioning scheme that's been used on hard disks since the PC first came out. It supports 4 primary partitions per hard drive, and a maximum partition size of 2TB.\nGPT disks are new.  The GPT disk itself can support a volume up to 2^64 blocks in length. (For 512-byte blocks, this is 9.44 ZB - zettabytes. 1 ZB is 1 billion terabytes). It can also support theoretically unlimited partitions.\nI personally like to be on the safe side.  I recommend that you get an up-to-date backup of your existing data, just in case.  I have seen this site come up a lot while searching on how to convert, and seen a lot of people recommend it.

But if I change boot mode from UEFI to legacy, Ubuntu works fine. In fact, right now I am writing this post from Ubuntu. \nAlso Windows 8 is not in the GRUB menu. Can somebody tell me how I can add Windows 8 to the GRUB menu and how can I boot installed Ubuntu in EFI mode? I've tried to use boot-repair before, but it didn't go well.\n[dead link to boot info summary removed]\n\nA: Your Boot Info Script output is a bit puzzling: It shows a GUID Partition Table (GPT) disk, which means that Windows will boot only in EFI mode. There's also evidence of an EFI-mode Windows boot loader. So far so good. It gets puzzling in that there's no evidence of GRUB on the hard disk, either in EFI mode or in BIOS mode; but there is evidence of a BIOS-mode Windows boot loader. My suspicion is that the Boot Info Script has simply mis-identified the BIOS-mode GRUB as the Windows boot loader. Certainly that's the simplest explanation that also explains why you can boot both Windows and Linux; however, it could be that something else is going on.\nIf I'm right and you've got a BIOS-mode GRUB, then you'll never get it to chainload to your EFI-mode Windows; that's just not possible. You could, though, use my rEFInd boot manager to switch between EFI-mode Windows and BIOS-mode Linux. You'd need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFInd in Windows, as described in the documentation.\n\n*Edit the refind.conf file: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the options.\n\n\nThe result should be that rEFInd will enable you to boot to Windows or to GRUB, and GRUB will then boot Linux. You could also try an EFI-mode boot of Linux by installing an EFI filesystem driver for your Linux filesystem (probably ext4fs). Given what you've reported, this might not work now, but it might work in the future, once drivers and default configurations mature for better EFI support.\nKeep in mind, though, that I'm very uncertain about any of this; it could be that you're actually booting Linux in EFI mode. If so, a tweak to GRUB's configuration might work, or installing rEFInd and its ext4fs driver would also work.\n", "Q: script to clear folder/drive on boot I want to make my own /tmp folder on one of my drives /media/Torrents\nHow would I go about create a script to run on startup applications?

Then copy/paste it into an empty text file (not using something like libreoffice or Open Office, but with something like gedit). Save it as whateveryouwant.sh. Right click on it, go to \"Properties\"->\"Permissions\" and check the box to make it executable.\nThere are lots of options to run it at system start up.

I haven't customised the mute/volume scripts etc. The mute key mutes my audio but doesn't unmute it. When I run alsamixer I see the effect of the mute key on alsa: it mutes both the \"Master\" and the \"Headphone\"/\"Speaker\" channels, but then on un-mute it only un-mutes the \"Master\" channel.\nI can manually un-mute the component channels in alsamixer, and my sound comes back. But of course I shouldn't have to.\nHow do I fix it so that mute-unmute works via the key?\n(My problem seems similar to question 118675 but not the same, and the accepted answer there doesn't affect my situation.)\n(I was using older Ubuntu Studio 11.10 until recent upgrade, and the mute key was configured fine.)\n\nA: Thanks so much! This helped me with my Arch/LXDE setup - the mute button xml that is recommended on the LXDE wiki mutes all of the channels in alsamixer and doesn't unmute them (at least not for my sound card).\nHow I got it fixed:\nI changed the XF86AudioMute command value to:\namixer -q -D pulse sset Master toggle\n\n\nA: OK I believe I have solved it: the important thing to know is I'm using Ubuntu Studio, which means the window manager is openbox. So what I need to do is edit the keybindings defined in ~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml - you can see the option defined here:\n\n    <keybind key=\"XF86AudioMute\">\n      <action name=\"Execute\">\n          <command>amixer -q sset Master toggle</command>\n      </action>\n    </keybind>\n\nwhich I edit to become:\n\n    <keybind key=\"XF86AudioMute\">\n      <action name=\"Execute\">\n          <command>amixer -q -D pulse sset Master toggle</command>\n      </action>\n    </keybind>\n\nand then after logout-login, the mute key works as expected.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my trackpoint configure save, despite udev rule? I have followed the instructions from here exactly. I was able to increase the speed and sensitivity of my trackpoint. However, those settings would revert itself to the default upon restart. In other words, the settings don't save. \nWhat am I doing wrong? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a Lenovo ThinkPad X120e that has an AMD 64-bit processor. Please someone help me with this, as I cannot use the touchpad, and I will have to dump Linux and go back to Windows if I don't have proper trackpoint support.\n\nA: I have no idea why, but an udev rule didn't work for my x200 either. What did work however is this upstart-job from the german ubuntuusers-wiki. \njust create the file /etc/init/trackpoint.conf as root\n    sudo gedit /etc/init/trackpoint.conf\n\nwith the following content:\ndescription \"Trackpoint-Settings\"\nenv TPDIR=/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2\nstart on virtual-filesystems\nscript\n  while [ ! -f $TPDIR/sensitivity ]; do\n    sleep 2\n  done\n  echo -n 200 > $TPDIR/sensitivity\n  echo -n 150 > $TPDIR/speed\n  echo -n 0 > $TPDIR/press_to_select\nend script\n\nchange the path in the second line to the path where your trackpoint-settings are saved.

Everpad keeps accumulating alternate version, while the desktop version and the web version of Evernote do not. How does one get rid of the alternate version links? they are taking up a lot of real estate.\n\n\nA: I answered this here:  https://github.com/nvbn/everpad/issues/340\nIt is not the ideal way but here it is:\nI was able to remove the alternate versions by going to /home/username/.everpad\nOpening up everpad.5.db in an SQL lite database browser (on ubuntu from software center) and manually deleting the extra note records in the notes table.\nIf you have a lot of alternate notes then I would suggest running an sql query by finding out which note is the one you want to keep then deleting all notes of that name that do not have the id of the one you want to keep. Make sure to back up the database file first in case you make a mistake.\nExample:\nDELETE FROM notes WHERE title=\"title of note\" and id !=5;\n\nFrom the looks of the db design you can also delete all alternate versions across all notes with something like this:\nDELETE FROM notes WHERE conflict_parent_id>0;\n\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Format USB drive using mformat?

What is zeitgeist-fts?!\nIt's always in the 3 top positions of memory usage (competing with Firefox and Compiz) . After a fresh boot it uses about 30 MB, but after some hours or a day, it goes above 300 MB and stays there !\nThe file of this process is located at /usr/lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-fts. I don't know what this thing does, but if it doesn't break any functionality, I would be really happy to remove it, because memory capacity is very precious to me.\nEdit: I'm using Unity desktop on Ubuntu-12.04.2 LTS.\n\nA: What zeitgeist is\n\nZeitgeist is a service which logs the users’s activities and events, anywhere from \n  files opened to websites visited and\n  conversations. It makes this information readily available for other\n  applications to use in form of timelines and statistics. It is able to\n  establish relationships between items based on similarity and usage\n  patterns by applying data association algorithms such as “Winepi” and\n  “A Priori”\nZeitgeist is the main engine and logic behind GNOME Activity Journal which is \n  currently seen to become one of the main means of\n  viewing and managing activities in GNOME version 3.0\n\nSource: Wikipedia\nHow to quick-fix it\nAs zeitgeist is a journal, it'll grow bigger day after day, leading to ram consummation problem.\nThe easiest way to solve this is to make some clean by removing the current journal to let a new one take its place. It's not dangerous and can be done with a single command-line :\nrm -r ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/\nOr with your your file browser (ctrl + h to display .hidden file) :\nin your Home folder (~/) > .local > share, and remove zeitgeist\nYour Ram consummation should be back to normal after a reboot. You can stay with this solution and wait until the next zeitgeist problem (probably in some years), or try one of the following solution.\nHow to disable it\n(without remove it)\nBetter would be to disable it instead of removing it.\nFirst open startup applications and UN-tick zeitgeist from startup automatically. \n\nIf you don't see zeitgeist in startup applications, open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and issue the following command\nsudo sed 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' -i /etc/xdg/autostart/zeitgeist-datahub.desktop \n\nTurn off Record Activity \nOpen Privacy settings and turn off Record Activity. \n\nLast but not least, remove the execution bits to prevent application from running. \nFrom a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) \nsudo chmod -x /usr/bin/zeitgeist-daemon\nsudo chmod -x /usr/bin/zeitgeist-datahub\nsudo chmod -x /usr/lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-fts\n\nThe zeitgeist-fts could be in an different location from what is specified here. If you cannot find it, issue the following commands one-by-one to locate the correct path.\nsudo updatedb\nlocate zeitgeist-fts\n\nHow to remove it\nFollowing might be dangerous and remove also some important packages for Dash functionality.\n\nRun sudo apt-get remove zeitgeist* in a terminal. It might remove a\n  few related packages, but so long as you don't see anything suggested\n  for removal that you don't want, you should be fine.\nAs per comments: you will lose unity functionality (I was not sure how\n  much when I first wrote the answer) if you remove zeitgeist. So, I\n  suggest you just disable logging.\nIf you don't need unity to function correctly, you can go ahead and\n  remove zeitgeist, and just use the classic session (from the login\n  screen).\nYou can also blacklist everything or turn off logging altogether.\n\nSource: AskUbuntu\n\nA: There are times when zeitgeist-fts starts acting up really weird. The issue is very erratic and not really easily reproducible at times.\nOne workaround is to delete the fts.index directory\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/fts.index/\n\nthen it will try to reindex it. I guess the high memory consumption is due to broken index. Deleting the index will force zeitgeist-fts to try to reindex it again.\n\nA: After disabling activity recording (as explained by @NikTh), remove zeitgeist data altogether:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/\n\nThis folder will be recreated on next reboot with empty data and zeitgeist process won't take so much memory.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic, to disable service restart after reboot:\ncd /usr/lib/systemd/user\nsudo ln -snf /dev/null zeitgeist-fts.service\n\n", "Q: Unable to locate package libopencv-dev I'm running 12.04 desktop on a persistence USB pendrive.

As the title says, is it safe for me to install this driver for a Xerox WorkCentre 7835 Printer on my Ubuntu 13.04 installation?\nBecause when I try to install them it says something about a bad package quality. I really don't want to break my Ubuntu setup.\nHere is the driver\nHere is the log\n\nA: i'm not sure where I found them on Xerox's site but I usually just download the .ppd file instead of the .deb package.  During the install of the printer when it asks for a driver or ppd file, i point it to that.\nIt looks like the main complaint about the deb is that the files should be owned by root instead of whoever it leaves it as.  That might be an easy post-install fix.  \nhttp://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/04/view-and-extract-packages/ will tell you how to get the files out of a deb so you can examine them more closely in a safe directory.\nThe other errors:\nE: XeroxPrtDrv: bad-package-name\nE: XeroxPrtDrv: package-not-lowercase\nE: XeroxPrtDrv: maintainer-address-missing Xerox\ndon't sound at all like a real problem.\nThe only one that does sound like a problem is:\nE: XeroxPrtDrv: malformed-deb-archive found 4 members instead of 3\nAccording to http://lintian.debian.org/tags/malformed-deb-archive.html\nthat is a serious problem.  I suspect the deb won't even work.  You probably need to contact Xerox and let them know they have a malformed-deb-archive problem with those packages.\n\nA: I'm also trying to make xerox 7835 work with Ubuntu 13.10, and here are my current conclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the \"install printer\" wizard (via printer), and let the recommended choices (driver for 7345). With that you should be able to print\n\n*You can use the \"xerox .deb\", which will install your printer via the xeroxprtmgr (sudo). You may need to put printer IP if it's not found\n\n\nThe second solution is the only way to use \"advanced features\" such as \"secure printing\" or \"stapler\"...\nIn fact you have to run sudo xerxprtmgr and then configure an automatically found printer or add it manually (you need it's IP).\nAfter that, a printing queue will be added, and you'll have a nice GUI configuration tool (like in windows) to configure your queue... Which will appear in the printer list.\nThe only problem, is that you have to configure a custom queue for each custom parameter assocations...\nDon't hesitate if I can help more... I spent some time understanding the xerox driver concepts...\n\nA: Under Ubuntu you should follow the following rules:\n(1.) Try just connecting the printer.\nUnlike Windows (XP, 7, 8, etc.), you do not normally need a driver. You may need a driver for some unusual function or lesser known brand/model, but most printers can just be plugged in.\n(2.) Look on the forums, for advice.\nSome simple configuration may solve any minor issue, after step 1.\n(3.) Only use drivers from 'trusted' sources.\nIf you found the vendor / drivers site from a Google search (or equiv.), AND it does not warn you of malware (for that site), see what they recommend.\nSome random driver found on the Internet (often with an installer app.) can not always be trusted.\nAlways read all install instructions carefully. Make sure they are for you version (release, 32bit or 64bit, etc.) of Linux.\n\nIf you have tried all that, ask a question here ..\nYour original question would be best answered by trying it (the driver) for you, but we would also need the same model / brand printer for that.\n", "Q: How do I trigger rsync on file modification? I can sync folders with rsync -avz /directory /target, now I wish to do it if I changed a file in /directory so rsync should be called automatically.\nI am using Virtual Box and the shared folder of Virtual Box is really slow, especially if you have a webpage which is using the shared folder as document root. With rsync i would be able to work with my local files on shared folder and sync it automatically with document root.\nI hope someone has an idea how to do so,crontab would be not good, because it is executed each x minutes, so if i don't do anything, it will still call rsync but not if I modified my file.\nBest regards\n\nA: You could use Lsyncd (Live Syncing Daemon):\n\nLsyncd watches a local directory trees event monitor interface\n  (inotify or fsevents). It aggregates and combines events for a few\n  seconds and then spawns one (or more) process(es) to synchronize the\n  changes. By default this is rsync. Lsyncd is thus a light-weight live\n  mirror solution that is comparatively easy to install not requiring\n  new filesystems or block devices and does not hamper local filesystem\n  performance.\n\nHere is for example a tutorial for Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: You can use inotifywait and rsync. inotifywait with the event modify,create,delete enabled. This way you will synchronize with your server only when the file changes, otherwise it will sync whenever a file is read (editors read several times your file to check if there are any changes). Thus said:\nwhile inotifywait -r -e modify,create,delete /directory; do\n    rsync -avz /directory /target\ndone\n\n\nA: \ncrontab would be not good, cause it is executed each x seconds/minutes, so if i dont do anything, it will still call rsync but not if i modified my file\n\nrsync will only sync the files that have been changed. If nothing has changed, it will exit. That's really a minimal overhead.\nIf you're unhappy with that you could use inotifywait:\nwhile inotifywait -r /directory/*; do\n    rsync -avz /directory /target\ndone\n\nThat will be more instant but it will do things every time you save.\n\nA: Expanding slightly on a comment to the accepted answer I've had success using fswatch to trigger an scp of changed files to the guest.  On Linux this is a wrapper around inotify but it's also cross-platform (I'm on a Mac with an Arm-based QEMU guest). I've tacked on an ssh remote build as well.

Audio within mp4 and flv files is AAC, and a proper container for that is m4a.

I have a ThinkPad with Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail). I found that whenever I try to connect to Wi-Fi in Starbucks (where a login page is needed), it never succeeds. The same thing happens when I try to log into Wi-Fi in college where login is also needed. The login page does not appear as it used to on Windows.\nWhat is the problem and what information should I provide?\n\nA: Wireless networks like that are called Captive Portals. Wikipedia's Captive Portal article has notes on how the common implementations work.\nOne reason they might fail is if you have specified a static IP address, or have specified a DNS server, in your interface configuration. A lot of these captive portals rely on you using only the settings (IP/netmask/gateway/DNS) provided by their DHCP server. \nI've known folks who prefer to use OpenDNS or Google Public DNS rather than their ISP or LAN's DNS servers, and aren't able to use captive portals which rely on DNS spoofing using their own private DNS servers. \n", "Q: How to connect to internet after removing Network Manager?

Now do:\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup -v eth0\n\nYour ethernet should now be connected so that you can re-install NM or Wicd. After doing so, repeat the process but remove the eth0 lines if you select NM. I believe the eth0 lines may remain for Wicd.\n\nA: If you delete Network Manager you have to configure all network settings manual. This is a bunch of work. However, it's possible.\nWhy do you have removed it? It is very convenient and I think you could configure all thinks you need.\nA good advice for the manual network configuration you can find here: Network Configuration\n\nA: Whenever I delete network manager I can put an UTP cable in my system directly into my router. A reboot (or a /etc/init.d/networking restart) resets the networking and also shows me my LAN connection (though not with icons on the desktop it does work). \nAfter that you can re-install network-manager (or wicd as that was the one I started using for a little while) over the wired connection. \n", "Q: Create new Gnome Classic theme and config system to offer all users I'm trying to create new Gnome Classic theme (gnome-session-fallback) on Ubuntu Precise.

I am creating an app for Ubuntu Touch using HTML5. I am opening my HTML page using QtWebKit's WebView and I really need to let the app take pictures and record audio, however, I can't access the webcam or microphone using the normal getUserMedia/Stream API like in Chrome and Firefox, and cordova doesn't seem to be working at all.\nI need to know if there is any way to access camera and microphone input using HTML5, and if not, can you please help me find a workaround like using native QML to take pictures and audio and using the output in the HTML parts of the app?\n\nA: If you are using HTML, you should be using Cordova to access the native devices. You are saying that Cordova is not working for you, but unless you are more descriptive in what exactly is not working, it's difficult for anyone to help.\nAlternatively, if you port your app to pure QML, you can then use the Camera component to access the device's camera.\n\nA: HTML5 app development is under rapid development now.

How can I make manpages (from the man command) open in a web browser for easier navigation?\n\nA: man2html\nTo search man pages\nI installed the man2html package then navigated to http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html to view the man pages. These pages can be viewed offline, link to other man pages and feature a search function. Source\nTo directly open a page (from command line)\nI made this script here (it's not short), it just navigates directly to the webpage (from man2html) for a certain manpage. It can open multiple man pages specified as command line arguments. Save the script somewhere and give it execute permissions (chmod +x script.sh). Run it as ~/script.sh (assuming saved in ~ directory) with pages to open as arguments. To open something like init(8), use ~/script \"8 init\".\n\ndwww\nTo search man pages\nInstall the dwww paackage and navigate to http://localhost/dwww/man/1 to search the pages. These pages can be viewed offline, link to other man pages and feature a search function.\nTo directly open a page (from command line)\nI made this script here (it's not short), it just navigates directly to the webpage (from dwww) for a certain manpage. It can open multiple man pages specified as command line arguments. Save the script somewhere and give it execute permissions (chmod +x script.sh). Run it as ~/script.sh page (assuming saved in ~ directory) with pages to open as arguments. To open something like init(8), use ~/script init/8. Without pcregrep, you need to type the /8 all the time, with it, just type the name of the page.\n\nA: Using the man program\nLooking at the manpage of man,\nman man\n\nThere is the -H option, or its equivalent --html which will generate the HTML for the manual and open them in the browser.\n\nThis  option  will  cause  groff  to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.\n\nSo to open any man page in the browser just use:\nman -Hfirefox <command>\n\nor\nman --html=firefox <command>\n\nBoth are the same.\nYou can use firefox, google-chrome, chromium-browser or any other in place of the firefox word.\nSelect a default browser permanently\nBefore calling the man command, use the following command:\nexport BROWSER=firefox\n\nThis way, you can just use man -H or man --html without specifying the browser each time.\nman -H ls\n\nYou can also add the previous export command to your ~/.bashrc so you won't have to type it each time you open a new terminal and try using man -H\nTroubleshoot\nIf you got an error saying something like this:\nman: command exited with status 3: /usr/bin/zsoelim | /usr/lib/man-db/manconv -f UTF-8:ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8//IGNORE | preconv -e UTF-8 | tbl | groff -mandoc -Thtml\n\nYou will need to install the groff package.\nsudo apt-get install groff\n\n\nUsing Yelp\nIf a choice of browser is not relevant, you can use the yelp command which offers navigation through the man pages.\nyelp man:<command>\n# example: yelp man:ls\n\n\nUsing the Ubuntu Manpage Repository\nYou can also visit https://manpages.ubuntu.com/ and check almost all man pages there.

The laptop broke a month ago and I called Dell support to fix it. A small metallic clip was dislodged from the back lid and short-circuited  \"something\" on the motherboard.

In this example 8 is the number of hours you want to wait before running your script mycommand.sh.\n\nA: Yes, you can set a cron job.\nFor example if now the time is 14:39:00 and today is friday, 30 august, you can add the following cron job (to be executed after 8 hours) in your crontab file using crontab -e command:\n39 22 30 8 5  /path/to/mycommand.sh\n\nMore about:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron\n\nA: You can use the at command.  The at execute commands at a later time. The at utility shall read commands from standard input and group them together as an at-job, to be executed at a later time.\nUsually, at is installed by default in Ubuntu, but if your release doesn't include it, install via:\nsudo apt-get install at\n\nFor more information, options, examples, and others, see the manpage in man 1 at.\nExample of a relative time specification (note the space between + and the duration): \nat now + 8 hours -f ~/myscript.sh\n\nYou can also use convenient shorthands, like tomorrow or noon, as in\necho \"tweet fore\" | at teatime \n\nNote: This will run the command to the left of the pipe immediately - and its output (which is piped to at) will be run by at at the scheduled time. So, the above command schedules tweet fore to be run at teatime.\nThe example also demonstrates how you can pipe actions into at.  at -c is the way you can examine scheduled actions, which you can conveniently list with their number, as with:\nat -c 3\n\n\nA: Use the Gnome-based GUI for cron, at, and the like:\nThe introduction of the CronHowto suggests using the gnome-schedule gui, which is much nicer than typing all the garbage into the terminal (esp. for \"average\" Ubuntu users who are not \"power\" *nix/bsd users.)\nRun it by using the Unity Dash (or other applications menu) to look for Scheduled Tasks or running gnome-schedule.\n\nOn Gnome-based Ubuntu systems Gnome Scheduled tasks tool (from the gnome-schedule \n  package) in Applications --> System Tools provides a graphical interface with prompting \n  for using Cron. The project website is at http://gnome-schedule.sourceforge.net/; the\n  software is installable from the Software Center or by typing\nsudo apt-get install gnome-schedule\n\nin a terminal.\n\nUsing gnome-schedule, for a script in your home directory, a new \"at\" command would be set up using this type of window:\n\n\nA: Check the output of date in a loop. This is a quick and dirty way to do this, like if you can't use at, cron, or other tools.\nSay you want your script to run at noon:\nuntil [[ $(date +%H:%M) == 12:00 ]]; do\n    sleep 30\ndone\n./mycommand.sh\n\nSay you want it to run tomorrow at noon (today is Nov 24 for me):\nuntil [[ $(date +%d_%H:%M) == \"25_12:00\" ]]; do \n    sleep 30\ndone\n./mycommand.sh\n\n\nPreviously, this answer recommended regex, which has some pitfalls, like a lot of special characters. As well it recommended matching against the whole date string, which is more error-prone since it's locale-dependent. For example, I use some French locale formats since I live in Quebec, so if I forget about that and write until [[ $(date) == \"25 12:00\" ]], it will never match because the French ordering is \"day month year, time\" instead of the English \"month day time year\".\n\nA: In order to install gnome-schedule on Ubuntu 21.04 you can do\n$ sudo snap install gnome-schedule --edge --jailmode\n\n", "Q: Can I get copies of Ubuntu 13.04 on CD's to give our Free Software Club members?

Would specify which version of the program when I use apt-get install?\n\nA: Packages in the official Ubuntu repositories are not always the current release versions from the developers. If the developers have their own repository you can always add that repository to your software sources and apt will pull the current version from there. Otherwise you will have to download the current version from the developer source and follow their directions for installing.\n\nA: That's the way you get the latest version of a package. What happens is that Eclipse 3.8 is the latest version available from the repos, in this case universe. Many software projects do not maintain packages for Ubuntu and you end up relying on voluntaries for the job. Eclipse is one of such cases and is usually lagging a good deal from the official release.\nSince Eclipse itself provides automatic updates for its packages and interface you may opt for installing it manually.\n\nA: Your command to apt-get update will refresh the package list with the latest available in the Ubuntu distro that you are using (I'm assuming your on 13.04 or 12.04.3 right?). If your are curious about what version apt-get will install, use the following:\nsudo apt-cache show arduino\nor;\nsudo apt-cache show eclipse\nIt will produce the following output:\nPackage: eclipse\nPriority: optional\nSection: universe/devel\nInstalled-Size: 121\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Developers \nOriginal-Maintainer: Debian Orbital Alignment Team \nArchitecture: all\nVersion: 3.8.1-1ubuntu1\nDepends: eclipse-jdt (>= 3.8.1-1ubuntu1), eclipse-pde (>= 3.8.1-1ubuntu1)\nFilename: pool/universe/e/eclipse/eclipse_3.8.1-1ubuntu1_all.deb\n...\nTrust this helps!\n", "Q: How to minimize a fullscreen app? I would like to be able to minimize fullscreen applications using Alt-Tab, like on Windows.\nIt is irritating that I can't do it, because when I am playing a game and I have a message in skype, I can't read the message without quitting the game first.\nNote that I don't want to kill the application, just minimize it (and show the desktop). Is there an easy way for this?\nI'm using Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit.\n\nA: This is application specific. Some applications will handle Alt+Tab and refuse to pass it onto the window manager, while others let it float through.\nUnfortunately there isn't a good answer to this but there are options...\n\n\n*\n\n*Control+Alt+F1..6 should work as a combination. I don't think it's even possible for an X application to block this combo. That will get you to a TTY console and from there you can... Well you can't do all that much. But you can log in and fire off commands like:\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool windowminimize $(xdotool getactivewindow)\n\nWhich you game might just ignore. Anyway, Control+Alt+F7 to get back to the desktop.\n\n*On a similar idea, you could run your game in a separate X server. Loading it on TTY8 would mean you could switch between desktop and game by smacking Control+Alt+F8 and Control+Alt+F7 respectively.\n\nA: You can take a look at this question: What are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts?\nThere are some shortcuts that may help: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Super+↓ - Restore/Minimize the current window (seems to be buggy at the moment)\n\n*Ctrl+Super+D - Show desktop; hitting it again restores the windows\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+Numpad 0 - Minimize the current window (Ubuntu 12.04.1)\n\n*Shift+Alt+↑ - Expo mode for all windows in the current workspace only.\n\n\nA: Alt+Tab is usually supposed to work in Ubuntu for switching applications, even from a full-screen program. However, when you're running a Windows application with Wine, it does not always work. I don't have League of Legends, but the technique described in this post of this Ubuntu Forums thread may help.\nPress the Super key (i.e., the Windows key) and type in: configure wine\nAn icon for Configure Wine should appear in the search results. Click on it. The \"Wine configuration\" window will come up. Click the \"Graphics\" tab.\n\nCheck the box that says Emulate a virtual desktop. Unless you want your game to appear in a Window that's smaller than the whole screen, you'll probably want to fill in your current resolution for Desktop size. For example, if your screen is \"1808p\", you'd replace 800x600 with 1920x1080.\nThis should make it possible for you to Alt+Tab out, because this makes Wine encapsulate your game in a window. Even if the game itself doesn't like to be minimized, and even if there is a bug in Ubuntu preventing it from being minimized, this should usually work around the problem.\nIt might not work, though. If it doesn't, I recommend trying other shortcuts, as Hugo Vieria suggested, and also the general, Wine-nonspecific method that Oli has suggested.\nFinally, the Emulate a virtual desktop setting will affect other Windows programs you run with Wine (if any), but you can change it (and change it back) as needed.\n", "Q: \"Can't alloc filename\" when executing mdb-export on a mounted file I've mounted a Windows directory with CIFS :\nsudo mount -t cifs //SERVER/Bases/some/path ~/mnt/data -o user=windomain/login%password\n\nThis works :\ncp mnt/data/blabla/file.mdb .\n/usr/bin/mdb-export file.mdb tablename\n\nBut this doesn't :\n/usr/bin/mdb-export mnt/data/blabla/file.mdb tablename\n\nIt fails with output\nCan't alloc filename\n\nWhy ?

Thanks\"\n08/30/2013 07:37:27AM   Session Ended\n\n\nA: As far as I can tell that simply means that HP does no longer officially support Linux drivers. That's far from saying that HP printers don't work on Linux.\nLooking at HPLIP project news page, updates are coming at constant pace http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/news.html\nBefore buying a new printer/scanner search \"linux [printer-model-number]\" to check if it is working on linux. That is a common practice for any device actually, not only printers.\n\nA: Speaking as an Ex HP Third level support person, this is BS.  I have multiple HP printers at work working with Ubuntu better that they worked with Windows.\n\nHP is investing resources in open source efforts to improve the\n  support for devices within Linux, including HP printers. Currently HP\n  provides Linux printing support for over 1,200 HP printers. These\n  pages feature information to help guide you regarding the current\n  status of support for HP printers with Linux, as well as a list of\n  sites for additional information. This site will provide ongoing\n  updates as HP continues to expand its commitment to Open Source and\n  Linux.HP\n\nHP Linux Imaging and Printing\nFor supported Printers\n\nA: Speaking as the recent purchaser of an OfficeJet 6600 (a fairly new printer), I don't think this is true. The printer works fine, the scanner works fine and I've even automated the document feeder into a little document store application I've written. It's all fine.\nWhat's more is there have been several HP-pushed HPLIP driver updates while I've been using them, adding support for new printers and fixing bugs in old ones. We're up to 3.13.8. That doesn't look like a company winding down support.\nOne feature that is missing is the Scan-To-Computer function (you stand at the printer, feed in a document and press scan on the printer and a new document magically appears on your computer). They haven't implemented that in HPLIP. That might be what the person you were speaking to was talking about... Maybe.\nI don't want to be too quick to decide. I'm just a customer. I'd probably talk to a few more people before making my mind up though. Have a word with the HPLIP developers and see what they say.\n\nA: I have had no issues with using HPLIP. Their installer is easy on Ubuntu. If you need instructions, try this:\nhttp://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/install/install/index.html\n\nA: I bought a new HP printer(Deskjet 2515 AIO of the series 2510) and just completed installing it using  hplip-3.13.8 from http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html and is working pretty fine.\nThe scan quality using xsane or other software is lower than the windows counterpart, but acceptable.\nSo, HP still works on Linux.\n Maybe the agent you talked to have no knowledge about Linux !!\nMaybe she is either Windows or Mac user ???\n", "Q: Can't remove a directory or `cd` into a directory that exist I can not seem to rm -r or even cd into a directory that clearly exist but I get the error No such file or directory.

If you look closely, you'll see that the letter m appears farther to the right on the line, than the names of the other entries. Furthermore, they are listed before entries that start with ., which is a clue that they do not start with any letter. (After all, readme.txt is \"alphabetized\" after the . and .. directories.)\nOr it could be some other weird character that ls shows as a space.\nSo, instead of calling the directory modx_camwright_2013_08_30__1377875941, call it:\n' modx_camwright_2013_08_30__1377875941'\n\nTo cd to it, run:\ncd ' modx_camwright_2013_08_30__1377875941'\n\nTo remove it and all its contents, run:\nrm -r ' modx_camwright_2013_08_30__1377875941'\n\nIf those commands don't work, maybe the character at the beginning isn't a space. (It probably is--most other whitespace characters are shown as ?s by ls.)\nYou can use ? to match a single character. So, you can try calling this directory by the name:\n?modx_camwright_2013_08_30__1377875941\n\n(Don't use quotes.)\nOr if it's multiple characters, you can use *, which matches zero or more characters:\n*modx_camwright_2013_08_30__1377875941\n\n(Don't use quotes for that either.)\nMost likely, just quoting the name and adding a space to the beginning (as described above) will work.\n", "Q: How do I arrange photos by visual similarities?

It said \"EFI detected check options\"\nI used the recommended repair option. In the end it said \"buggy kernel detected, do you want to activate (Windows efi files will be saved and renamed)?\"\nAfter the reboot, I didn't get the option to choose the OS. It justy goes straight to Windows 8. \nWhat could be the problem?\n\nA: In the log we see that you answered No to the question Do you want to activate [Backup and rename Windows EFI files]?.\nTry again but this time answer Yes.\n\nA: Some observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Repair seems to think that Secure Boot is disabled. (Line 556: SecureBoot disabled.) If this is inaccurate, it could be the cause of the problem. In this case, you could either use efibootmgr to add EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi on the ESP to the boot list or (more easily) disable Secure Boot.\n\n*Your efibootmgr output (on lines 1027-1038 and 1119-1130) shows GRUB configured to boot first, so GRUB should be the default boot manager. That is, there's nothing wrong with your configuration, assuming Secure Boot is disabled; if it's not working, it's most likely a firmware bug.\n\n\nSome HPs are known to have a buggy EFI that ignores the boot order (as shown by efibootmgr). I recommend trying the following fixes/workarounds, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check with HP for a firmware update. After applying it, you might need to re-run Boot Repair.\n\n*Boot to Windows, open an Administrator Command Prompt window, and type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi. (If you're booting with Secure Boot active, replace grubx64.efi with shimx64.efi.) This might overcome the problem. If it doesn't, try....\n\n*Run Boot Repair again, but select the advanced options and check the button to back up and replace the Windows boot loader file. (I don't recall the precise phrasing.) This option applies an ugly and hackish workaround for the EFI bug: It replaces the Windows boot loader with a copy of GRUB and reconfigures GRUB to use the backed-up Windows boot loader to boot Windows rather than use the original filename. This usually works, but Windows sometimes reverses the change; and it's confusing, since then GRUB is running from the filename usually reserved for the Windows boot loader.\n\n*Return the computer to the store from which you bought it for a refund, buy a new computer with a less-broken EFI, and write to HP to tell them why you returned their computer.\n\n\nYou might consider doing #4 earlier in the list. People seem oddly reluctant to take this action, but it's the only one that will get the attention of manufacturers who are shipping broken products. If solution #1 doesn't work, the computer is defective, so solutions #2 and #3 should be unnecessary, and a return of the product is justified.\n", "Q: How to make iso image of current logged in system to use it as future installation media I have just installed Ubuntu 13.04 and due to installation of faulty media and different programs, my ubuntu crashed more than 7 times in last 3 days, Nvidia was the leading cause in 7 failure, and each time i had to install approx 600-700 mb of different application for my suite, like QT creator and Virtual Box, and different other apps.\nNow, I don't want to trouble myself to install them again , all i want is to make image of my current Installation, so that all i have to do is burn current iso in bootable pen drive and install them as it is.\nPlease give me option of verified source list download only.. \nI recently visited remastersys, and the text written on front page seems like to me, it might have been compromised, and if it is the case, than may be his package is backdoored, so i don't want to risk myself in using such binary.\nAre there valid , verified and secured way to make my current installation into ISO image, so that it can be used to burn it into some USB for bootable purpose.\nUpdate I don't want to download again any of already downloaded file, all i want is to use is same downloaded file.\nImportant Does ubuntu has no such built in verified application which can do some sort of system-restore or create backup of whole system, so that there is no re-installation required whenever system is in trouble\nThanks\n\nA: I can confirm that remastersys is safe.

Now the UUIDs used to identify partitions should be OK, but if a specific /dev/sd?? is mentioned, check it, and change it if necessary -- I'd guess the WD boot by itself will be device sda, so I'd expect the actual device should be root=/dev/sda5 on the linux line.

I open some application and immediately switch to another workspace since it takes some time to open. When it opens, I want it to open in the workspace where I opened it, not in the workspace where I am at when it opens.\nNote that I don't want it to associate an application with a viewport. Any application must be openable in any workspace.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Note: I don't know if the behaviour in workspace assignment described by you is possible. However, I see a chance that a common workaround might be almost as convenient for you.\nIs it reasonable to assume that not all of the applications you use regularly take so long to start up that you feel like switching the workspace in the meantime, and that it is actually just the usual resource-hungry giants like Firefox, Eclipse, LibreOffice and similar? If so, it might be as satisfying to just add general assignments to specific workspaces for those applications.\nSince Unity is a Compiz plugin, this can be done within the Compiz window management configurations (provided by package compizconfig-settings-manager)as described here, here or, more verbosely, here:\n\n\n*\n\n*use your Dash to run ccsm (Compiz settings GUI)\n\n*Open Window Management > Place Windows > Fixed Window Placement\n\n*Create a New entry at Windows with fixed viewport\n\n*In the editing dialog, select the window class by clicking on the +-button first, and on the  desired application window afterwards\n\n*Specify the workspace to place said application on using Viewport coordinates\n\n\nIf that doesn't work for some reason, you might want to try another window matching tool like Devilspie. \n\nA: I only know how to do that with KDE... I am not sure Unity can do that... If you really need that, I recomend installing KDE.\nWell, you have 4 workspaces. Open in 1 of them, go to another one, and then when the program opens, go to the first one and click the icon. I dont know if that will work, but... Its just an idea.\n\nA: I just try to open new app in the same way you did,and i got the same as you. You can move your opened apps in other workspace by clicking on workspace switcher and drag and drop from one workspace to another, or by right click on black window tray when your app is not maximized and send it to another workspace.\n\nA: I think that this video will help you to open applications on other workspaces.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZXesqjTECA\n", "Q: Is there an easy guide on how to prepare my python3 script for upload to my ppa? I have a python3 script (4000 loc) written in PyQt4 with four, five dependencies. In the same folder where that script is placed there are some subfolders where all additional  files (icons, saves, sounds, translations) are placed.\nI want to upload it to my a ppa which I had already created. I've read \"Uploading a package to a ppa\" but I don't understand it.\nIs there any step-by-step instruction for beginners? It seems harder to me to create a ppa than writing the whole program.\n\nA: Your confusion from all the existing guides is something probably every developer who wants to create a package for their ppa had experienced once. It is immanent to the complexity of building DEBIAN packages, and because of the many paths you can go to get there. Because of this you will not find a step by step guide which is as easy as you may want it to be now.\nWhat we can do here is to give you an idea on where to start to learn how to make a package ready for uploading to your ppa.\n\n\n*\n\n*Learn how to make a DEBIAN package\nThis is the first giant leap to take. Without an understanding on how a DEB package works you will not be able to fill your ppa. We do have some good answers to qestions here already:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I create a deb package for a single python script?\nThe answers there will give you a basic idea on the DEB package structure.\n\n*How to get my software into Ubuntu?\nIn answers to this question you will find great links to very good resources. Read them or bookmark them to find answers to issues you may encounter.\n\n\nMost of all it is important you learn from others. Download source packages and look how people did it there. You may even want to modify an exisiting package and use it as a template for your own.\n\n*Make your own DEBIAN package\nOnly after we are familiar with the structure and files a DEBIAN package needs to build it makes sense to try out ourselves. There are some good articles with special reference to Ubuntu which I recommend reading:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Packaging Guide\n\n*Packaging New Software\nYou again may want to try out the procedures and applications needed for building a package on a downloaded source of another package before you proceed with your own.\n\n*Learn from errors\nYou will see thousands of errors once you started to build a package from your own application. Do not take any of them lightly. Try to understand them and most importantly fix them step by step. This is where you will spend most time with reading packaging guides and DEBIAN policies.\n\n*Test your package\nAfter you suceeded with your own package you should test if it installs correctly. I recommend doing this in a VM for different versions, and to be able to revert any unwanted side effects. Also do run Lintian on your package to reveal errors and warnings. All these need to be fixed to get you package accepted for upload on your ppa later.\n\n*Upload to your ppa\nIn addition to exisiting answers I linked to above there is a good guide on Launchpad on how to create a ppa and upload to it. Read and follow it to avoid frustration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launchpad Packaging/PPA\n\n\n*Understand and fix the errors you may get after your first upload.\nOnce you actually started to not only read but to really package something you will soon find that most of your present confusion will eventually lead to knowledge. Don't give up too early. Once you see how it works it is getting easier and easier.\nLook at it as if it were game where you need to solve one puzzle after the other to reach the next level.\n", "Q: How to keep Network Manager from creating multiple named networks for the same actual network?

I turned off fast boot and secure boot and have installed Ubuntu. I can boot into Ubuntu without any problem however I can't boot into windows. When I try it says Error: invalid EFI. So I ran boot repair and now there are multiple options. Some still say the same thing. One goes to a windows menu and gives me the option to repair using a disk but when I use it the computer shuts down. On some of the boot options listed the screen will go black with a  blue windows logo in the center and a white \"loading\" circle under it, I have left it alone for up to 4 hours with it not leaving that screen. And finally one goes to a blue windows looking screen with no text and never loads further, similar to the black screen. Here is the link to my boot repair:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/6045602/\nAnyone have any ideas on what's wrong or how to fix it?\n\nA: You have a boot flag (with gpt that makes it the ESP or efi partition) on the main Windows install. With BIOS that might be correct, but with gpt you should only have the boot flag on the efi partition -sda2. Use gparted or gdisk to change it back to a data partition (remove boot flag). \nThat may be the entire issue with invalid EFI.\nNot sure what changes rEFInd may do. But in many cases it is suggested.\nGrub2's os-prober still has a bug and does not create correct chain load entries. Do not use any of those as they will not work. But the one's created by Boot-Repair should work or you can try directly booting Windows from UEFI menu. \n", "Q: Is my ISP throttling Ubuntu? today I just installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my MacBook Air.

The product sounds like snakeoil though so I suggest not touching it with a 10 foot pole.\nIt claims it has a 1 GB cache and that this makes it super fast, but the OS already caches files, and typically has access to more than 1 GB for that purpose, so caching the data a second time on the drive is pointless.  Worse yet, it sounds like the drive lies to the OS and claims it has written data when it is still sitting in its cache, in order to get great benchmark scores.

Try commenting out the section that sources /etc/bash-completion.\n#if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then\n#    . /etc/bash_completion\n#fi\n\nAnd see if you get a speed-up. I've commented it out myself too due to the ammount of time it takes to load. Without it, you just get the default completion, which is mainly filename completion. What bash-completion adds is completion for things like package names when you type e.g. apt-get install foo<tab>.\nIf you want to see everything that happens when bash is started in interactive (non-login) mode, try:\nPS4='+ $BASH_SOURCE:$LINENO:' bash -xic ''\n\nEDIT\nBased on the additional information provided in the question and the question's comments, it turned out the real problem was that the history file had some gigantic lines, which took time for bash to read and parse. So the solution in that case is to either truncate the file\n> \"$HISTFILE\"\n\nor manually edit it and remove the gigantic lines.\n", "Q: Cannot find/access files from previous install of Ubuntu (10.04) I've searched for this answer fairly extensively and fruitlessly thus far, mainly I find answers that regard finding Windows files after installing Ubuntu, and a lot of answers regarding Wubi (which I had to google) - I don't think those are relevant to my situation.\nMy problem;\nI can't access my old files from an install of Ubuntu 10.04\nI was running 10.04.

If, for example, I send Firefox to https://askubuntu.com/ and I have a generally restrictive inbound rules set, gufw will still allow Firefox to go outbound to askubuntu.com and get related information from that connection, such as actual site content, and allow that through.\n\nA: Open GUFW and click on the plus sign. In the first tab select the following and hit the add button for each one of them.\nAllow In Service HTTP\nAllow Out Service HTTP\nAllow In Service HTTPS\nAllow Out Service HTTPS\nAnd you're done.\n\nA: sudo default deny incoming  \nsudo default deny outgoing\n\ninternet\nsudo ufw allow out 53  \nsudo ufw allow out http  \nsudo ufw allow out https  \nsudo ufw allow out 8080 \n\ngmail-thunderbird\nsudo ufw allow proto tcp from 173.194.0.0/16   \nsudo ufw allow out to 173.194.0.0/16 \nsudo ufw allow out to 74.125.0.0/16 port 465 proto tcp\n\nhotmail-thunderbird\nsudo ufw allow proto tcp from 207.46.0.0/16   \nsudo ufw allow out to 207.46.0.0/16 port    \nsudo ufw allow out to 65.52.0.0/14 port 587 proto tcp\n\n", "Q: How to execute this specific python script (attached in the question) I Have a small net and last 2 weeks i get a lot of disconnections on my wireless stations \na friend of mine told me that 90% i get attacked by deauth packets i i researched a bit and found this py script.

(The existing system is Windows 7, 64-bit.)\n\nA: You need to have Windows convert the disk back to a basic disk ( in the disk utility ).\n\nA: Microsofts offical policy is a full backup, erase dynamic partitions and create new basic partitions. There is no undo.\nDynamic volume is a Microsoft proprietary format developed together with Veritas (now acquired by Symantec) for logical volumes.\nYou may be use a third-party tool, such as Partition Wizard MiniTool or EASEUS to convert a convert a dynamic disk to a basic disk without having to delete or format them.\nI've never used any of these and so I can't be sure they will work.Be sure to have good backups as any major partition change has risks.\nDynamic also on gpt as LDM\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365449%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\nhttp://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/26829-convert-dynamic-disk-basic-disk.html\n", "Q: Why is my Ubuntu share seen as a printer in Windows 7? On Windows 7 the 'shares' on my Ubuntu 12.04 are coming up with a printer icon and Windows 7 then tries to install a printer. Why does this happen and what should I do to be able to use my share?\n\nA: Samba server by default, shows a printers/print$ resources to anyone that browse the server shares. Samba actually doesn't know if cups, or other print server has actually a printer, but still show the shares. Actually, is quite weird that Windows 7 try to install this \"printer\" without asking you first, or without you asking Windows do so.\nSince this is a Ubuntu site, I'll tell you how to resolve this from the Ubuntu/Samba perspective:\nIn your /etc/samba/smb.conf file, you will see entries like this:\n[printers]\n   comment = All Printers\n   browseable = no\n   path = /var/spool/samba\n   printable = yes\n   guest ok = no\n   read only = yes\n   create mask = 0700\n\n# Windows clients look for this share name as a source of downloadable\n# printer drivers\n[print$]\n   comment = Printer Drivers\n   path = /var/lib/samba/printers\n   browseable = yes\n   read only = yes\n   guest ok = no\n\nWhat you have to do is, comment out or delete this lines.

How do I get java 6 to be one of the options for opening .jar files after I select properties then open with?\n\nA: I'd say that the reason for that is because you've installed the JDK, JRE. And in their original state, they wouldn't be an option to open .jar files. You can do any one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an IDE which has Java support, Eclipse, Netbeans and their ilk. This in my opinion is the simplest way to handle it.\n\n*Export the JDK's path to folder you wish to work in, using the export PATH command as follows:\n\n\nexport PATH=/path/to/dir:$PATH\nFor example, on my machine in the relevant folder i gave the following command: export PATH=$PATH: /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/bin\n\nA: I think that this is because by default, the Java .desktop files have the line NoDisplay=true preventing them from being shown in menus.

Try using one with more space I'm trying to use deja dup to backup to my ubuntu one account.  I have 9.5GB of storage on ubuntu one.  I am getting the error message: Backup location is too small.  Try using one with more space.\nI did a test backup to another partition, and my entire backup only took 6.2GB of space.\nAnyone have any idea what is going on here?\n\nA: I added another .5 GB from referrals on ubuntuone, bringing the total storage up to 10GB.  Now the backup is proceeding with no problems.  I'm not sure exactly why this is working now.  But it would not proceed with the backup until there was 10GB of space.  The backup is only taking up 6.2GB of space.  I think Deja Dup should provide more information when failing a backup.\n\nA: What Déjà Dup is asking for is a drive (not just the free space) that is at least as large as what the backup would take if uncompressed.\nThe way it knows this size is that before running the actual backup, it runs a sort of simulation and gets to know the entire amount of data to be backed up.\nSo in practice how many complete backups can fit inside a partition that Déjà Dup considers \"large enough\" depends from how compressable are your files.\nEDIT:\nThe above was confirmed to me in the Deja Dup support chat by Michael Terry, who is the main developer. For reference, the code implementing the check is here - and indeed, it compares the total size of the disk to the space required for (uncompressed) backup. Notice that (as clarified, again, by Michael) a check on free space is also run, few lines later, a failure of which triggers a separate error message.\n", "Q: How do I see the history of the commands I have run in tmux?

(If you really do have .Mozilla with a capital M, please let us know, and provide more details about what this folder is and what you're trying to accomplish.)\nAs mikewhatever says, files and folders whose names start with a . are hidden by default.

You can drag it in from a file browser window, or you can click the + to add files and select it.\n\nWhen the Select Files dialog box appears, you can press Ctrl+H to show hidden files, just as you would in a file browser window.\nIf you rename .mozilla so it doesn't start with a ., then it will always be shown, but it will not be found by Firefox. So if you prefer, you can rename the backed-up copy. But when you restore it, it will need to start with the . to be recognized as the folder that contains your Firefox profile.\n", "Q: Usb Flash drive no longer works on ubuntu 13.04 but external hard drive does? Recently my usb stick (flash drive) will not show up on my laptop when plugging it in, it has always worked before and when plugging it into a computer with windows it works fine, my hard drive still open right away but flash drive does not.\nAnyone got any ideas why.\n\nA: I'm having the same issue with two of three usb flash drives. While one of them (a SanDisk flash drive) works normally, the system recognizes the other two flash drives (a Lexar and a Kingston) as being attached to usb ports, but it doesn't attempt to mount them for some reason. \nHowever, I got them to load normally by restarting the computer and selecting the previous operating system kernel from the Grub menu during bootup. Ubuntu normally boots using the most recent kernel by default, but the previous kernels can be accessed and used to boot Ubuntu by selecting the Grub menu option \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\". \nIf your system is currently up to date, the current kernel in Ubuntu 13.04 (as of September 1, 2013) is 3.8.0-29 and the previous one is 3.8.0-27. If your grub menu is invisible during bootup because Ubuntu is the only operating system installed, pressing and holding the shift key during bootup should make it visible.\nIf the cause of your problem is exactly the same as mine, it appears to be related to the latest kernel update. I'm going to check to see if a related bug report has been filed at launchpad.  \nUPDATE: The latest Ubuntu 13.04 kernel 3.8.0-30 arrived today (Sept 6th) and it fixes this issue. \n", "Q: How do I install it on my notebook? it has no CD I don´t have a CD drive on my Asus notebook, and the installation file doesn't work when I try to install from a USB drive.\n\nA: I suggest you to re-create your USB drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*download an Ubuntu version from here (you can try both 12.04 and 13.04)\n\n*reformat your USB drive to FAT32\n\n*create the bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*from a Ubuntu PC ( I recommended this solution )\n\n*or from a Windows PC\n\n\n\n*configure your computer to boot from USB flash drive and boot from it.\nWell the detailed instructions are here....\n\nA: Assuming you are running Windows at the moment, I would recommend downloading unetbootin.\nIt can do everything for you.

I went through this forum post, and found out that it is possible to install a swap partition after installation of the OS. I just wanted a guide as to how I should do it so as to have it done safely and neatly. Do I first free up space equal to 4000MB (my RAM size) from my Windows 8 installation drive and simply format the new free space to a linux-swap? How exactly do I then bind it to /etc/fstab?

I have Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7 installed on different partitions. I want to do a fresh installation of Ubuntu 13.10 when it comes out. But for that I would have to remove Ubuntu 13.04. I want to know how to do that safely without running into a problem and repairing Windows 7 from USB or things like that.\nPlease note that I am not using Wubi.\n\nA: When Ubuntu 13.10 becomes stable and released, then you can upgrade to 13.10 without the need of re-installing. You should see the message in update-manager when the upgrade becomes available. \nIf for your own reasons you want to re-install, then first you must create a Live USB with 13.10 (I prefer USB, you can create DVD if you want). After that, boot from the USB you've made and at the installer window probably you will see the option of upgrade Ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 . Because the installer now is changing I cannot upload a picture of it because I don't know the final form. Either way the option of upgrade should exist. \nAnother way is through something else option. There you should know for sure the partition that you have installed Ubuntu 13.04, then click on this partition and then click change. Mount this partition to root (/) and proceed with the installation. You should click the Format box also, in order to have a clean installation of 13.10. Be aware that if you don't have a separate /home directory, all your personal files will be deleted. \n\n\nIn any of above ways you should not have any problem with Windows 7. Grub will be reinstalled and will recognize automatically the Windows 7 installation. \nIf for any reason you have a problem with grub (or grub menu) , use boot-repair to repair the grub.\n", "Q: Why don't applications respect a printer's default options? CUPS has always had a configurable set of \"Default Options\" for a print queue.\nsystem-config-printer also enables editing these.\nBut applications (see below) seem to completely ignore these! I'm sure (I've been using Debian/Ubuntu for 10 years) they didn't use to ignore them.\nIs there some issue somewhere? Or a configuration option I've got wrong somewhere? Or a fix/workaround?\nI've noticed that if I create a new user, the defaults are there. So there must be a user setting somewhere - But where?!\nSpecifics\nI know there's no point asking a question like this without specifics, so here you go:\n\n\n*\n\n*applications which disrespect defaults: Firefox, DigiKam, EOG (\"Image Viewer\"), LibreOffice 3, Thunderbird, Evince (\"Document Viewer\"). I haven't found a single application that does respect the defaults.\n\n*Environment: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Gnome Shell.\n\n*Printer driver (stock, from Ubuntu): \"HP Photosmart 7510 Series, hpcups 3.12.2\"\n\n*A specific example is that the default options say: duplex, \"best\" quality, \"plain paper\", but the apps all default to non-duplex, \"high resolution photo\" quality, \"photo paper\". This means it takes 10 minues per sheet, and costs a fortune in ink!\n\nA: Summary: you're probably seeing the options for the last instance in ~/.cups/lpoptions.\n\nThere are both system-wide defaults and per-user defaults.\nThe system-config-printer application and the CUPS web interface configure system-wide defaults. These are stored in /etc/cups/printers.conf and /etc/cups/ppd/NAME.ppd where NAME is the name of the printer. In a .ppd file, an option setting line looks like this:\n*DefaultDuplex: DuplexNoTumble\n\nThe possible values for this option, which is called Duplex, are given by lines like\n*Duplex None/Off: …\n*Duplex DuplexNoTumble/Long-Edge Binding: …\n*Duplex DuplexTumble/Short-Edge Binding: …\n\nThe part after the colon describes the commands to send to the printer to activate the setting. The part before the colon consists of a *, then the name of the option, then a space, then one or more names for the value separated by slashes (for example, “None” and “Off” mean the same thing for this particular option, you can use them interchangeably).\nYou can also have per-user defaults stored in a file called .cups/lpoptions in your home directory. The syntax of this file looks like this:\nDest lj/single Duplex=None\nDefault lj Duplex=DuplexNoTumble\n\nA line like Dest lj/single … defines an instance called single of the printer called lj. When printing to that instance, the Duplex option is set to None. When printing to the default instance, the Duplex option is set to DuplexNoTumble (i.e. double-sided). The line Default lj … defines default options when printing to lj. These options override the system-wide defaults. The use of Default rather than Dest makes lj the default printing destination.\n(You can also have a system-wide /etc/cups/lpoptions. Why have a system-wide file, which might seem redundant with the options set in the .ppd file? The difference is that if your computer acts as a print server from other computers, the .ppd file applies to all, whereas /etc/cups/lpoptions only applies when printing from the local computer.)\nYou can use instances to make different sets of options available under a nickname from the command line. For example, with the lpoptions file above, lp -d lj prints double-sided and lp -d lj/single prints single-sided. Instances are also visible in some GUIs, for example in the KDE print dialog.\nThe Gnome print dialog does not show different instances, you only get one. However, rather counter-intuitively, Gnome doesn't default to the options for plain lp, but instead picks the last instance that was mentioned in the lpoptions file. So for example, with the lpoptions file above, the default is duplex printing, but if the two lines were swapped, the default would be single-sided.\nAnother trap with Gnome is that it also reads the file ~/.lpoptions. This is an old location for ~/.cups/lpoptions, which the printing system doesn't read anymore since Ubuntu 12.04 or thereabouts, but which Gnome still reads as of Ubuntu 14.04. If you have one, rename it to .cups/lpoptions or delete it.\n\nA: I found that many applications (for example, firefox, evince, gThumb) follow the settings in ~/.cups/lpoptions\nUse a text editor to update your favourite settings.\nTo list all available options use the command \nlpoptions -l\n\nTo check the available duplex configuration for example use\nlpoptions -l | grep -i duplex\n\nshows:\nDuplex/2-Sided Printing: None *DuplexNoTumble DuplexTumble\n\nTo check the available printing quality options\nlpoptions -l | grep -i StpQuality\n\nshows:\nStpQuality/Print Quality: None Economy *Draft Standard High Photo HighPhoto UltraPhoto Best\n\n\nA: Ah ha! I looked at the hidden files in my home dir and found one called .cups which contained an lpoptions file.\nNo idea how that got there, but deleting the folder makes my defaults work again.\nSanity restored!\n\nA: Some applications \"remember\" the printer settings from previous print requests.  So if you change system defaults AFTER you have already printed once with previous defaults, it \"remembers\" previous settings even if you don't want it to!\nEg. Evolution stores printer settings in ~/.evolution/printing, Evince in ~/.config/evince/print-settings\nThere doesn't seem to be a standard way (or apps just don't adhere to it) for apps to store this info.\nI think, but haven't confirmed, that if you don't touch defaults when printing from the application, it won't save the settings, and therefore system defaults will continue to pass through.  But, change a setting once, and the saved setting will always override the system default for that application.\nThis explains why new users pick up defaults fine.  But existing users are seeing the problem.\n\nA: My solution is not the best one for sure, but worked for evince for my porpouses.\ncd ~/.config/evince\nrm print-settings\nchmod u-w .\n\nNow evince cannot save its settings and changes are valid just while it's open. Stupid and limited solution, I know! But good enough for me for now. :)\nRegards,\nJander\n", "Q: Whats the best way of making a web browser in Ubuntu? Well, I guess the the title gives it away.

The current LTS release, Ubuntu 12.04, will be supported until April 2017.\nNow, a regular release like 13.04, will only be supported for nine months. Considering new versions of Ubuntu are released every six months, you’ll have three months after a new version is released to upgrade to it or you won’t receive security patches anymore. \nWell, if you want to have the latest versions of all your software, and use the latest features before they make it to the LTS version of Ubuntu, upgrade to the every-six-month releases.

When I run it on win7 and unplug my network cable, I have an event. when I run the program on Ubuntu V12.10 and mono, I do not have any reaction when the network cable is unplugged?\nDoes anyone has some suggestions or solution?\nI use the applicationevents.vb form in VB.Net 2012 with the trigger: \n\nPrivate Sub MyApplication_NetworkChange() Handles Me.NetworkAvailabilityChanged\n\nThank you very much.\n\nA: From vbforums, there are two possible answers, from jmcilhinney. One says:\n\nI'm not 100% sure but I think it likely that that NetworkAvailabilityChanged event is presumably a wrapper for the NetworkChange.NetworkAvailabilityChanged event. The documentation for that event says:\n\nThe NetworkChange class raises NetworkAvailabilityChanged events when the availability of the network changes. The network is available when at least one network interface is marked \"up\" and is not a tunnel or loopback interface.\n\nPresumably you have at least one non-tunnel or loopback network interface marked as \"up\", even when you unplug your network cable.\n\nand the other:\n\nMy guess would be that it uses a Windows-specific API under the hood that is not available on Linux and either has no analogue or at least it hasn't been implemented in Mono.\n\nThere is also this question in StackOverflow that has no answer still. I was reading the source code of mono, trying to figure out this issue. Although it has a LinuxNetworkChange () function, I didn't saw what the problem is (and I'm not too familiarized with mono).\nEither way, since you didn't say that the program was firing an error, it could be that it wasn't catch or mono doesn't listen at all for it. A more robust search lies ahead.\n", "Q: after installation it does not appear I've installed 13.04 by USB drive, It is successfully installed but when I restarted, PC does not show the option to choose ubuntu, it directly loads windows-7.

One of them called \"Quick-Search the web\" (see more here) allows to search the web by typing a keyword (i.e twitter) and getting a web page directly (i.e https://twitter.com).\nBut even better, it allows the user to pass a query string so that you get the page you need without any time lost. For instance, you could define https://twitter.com/{query} and type \"twitter StackExchange\" in your Alfred launcher and it would then bring you directly to https://twitter.com/StackExchange\nBasically, I'm dying to find a way to do that (especially the latter with the query string) on Ubuntu.\nIs there any way to achieve something similar? Tried Synapse and Gnome Do but they don't offer such flexibility. Autokey might possibly offer this but certainly not out of the box but via Python scripting only (I guess).\n\nA: You can do this with most of the modern web browsers. The feature is commonly called search engines. (Most browsers use secondary search bar for it, located next to normal search bar, chrome's is build in into the normal search bar)\nAlso you might want to check duckduckgo search engine where you can use !bang syntax e.g. !twitter StackExchange (!g for google, !gi for google images and so on). Duckduckgo also has some other neat features like Goodies. The one for twitter let's you search for @StackExchange and brings latest twitt in addition to normal web search.\nAnd I am pretty sure you could do similar things with Unity dash. Not sure if anything like that exists yet.\n", "Q: How can I fix \"The creation of swap space in partition #6 of SCSI2 (0,0,0) (sda) failed\" while installing Ubuntu?

Don't make a Logical Partition. Why? It may install fine, but when you decide to upgrade to a later version of Ubuntu, it \"may\" (or may not) alter your partition table and you \"may\" (or may not) end up losing data. (I've experienced it.).\nThe solution? Use the entire free space for Ubuntu, and create a swapfile later. Check this for the process: Use swapfile instead of partition and hibernate\nPlease create swap 1.5 times your RAM if <2 GB, 4GB if =3GB and 100-200MB more than RAM if >3GB. Don't \"waste\" 10GB HDD space.\nP.S. Why is your /dev/sda1 'unknown'? If it's a Windows partition, it should've been of the 'type' ntfs. Boot into Windows or the Live DVD and see if the partition is usable. Delete it if not so.\n\nA: Try this once.. Hope it works for you.. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from pre-installed Ubuntu 13.04. \n\n*Using gparted on un-allocated space create an Extended partition. \n\n*When a new Extended partition will be created then divide it by creating two Logical partitions one for Ubuntu 12.04 installation and one for your Swap. \n\n*So after creation of extended it would show:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda4 : Extended. under that \n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda5 and \n\n*/dev/sda6. \n\n\n\nResult may vary also but should be in same format. \nJust give it a try. Then try to install Ubuntu on pre-formatted partition.  Note that the Format?option should be unchecked during the installation, so that it will not try to recreate the partitions made by Gparted.\nYes Ubuntu will be upgraded to newer newer version.

Every time at boot I get a message “Network service discovery disabled. Your current network has a .local domain, which is not recommended and incompatible with the Avahi network service discovery. The service has been disabled.”\n\nWhat does this mean for me?\nWi-Fi is disabled.\n\nA: It probably says that Avahi is disabled because you have a .local domain and Avahi doesn't work very well with this.\nAvahi is a zero conf protocol like Apples Bonjour commonly used if you have Macs on your network or if you want to chat with others on your local network without logging in to a server like Google Talk or MSN Messenger.\nYou can read about the problem here.\nYou could probably just ignore it or configure your network to use another domain name then the default .local.\n\nA: While there may be multiple causes, I began getting the exact same error on ubuntu 14.04 after a change of ISP.  Some naughty ISP's use local domain addresses for their DNS servers as explained here.  My ubuntu box's network uses a manual configuration so setting the DNS to my router's IP instead of the ISP's DNS server address fixed the problem.  Internally, the router is using the ISP's locally domained DNS server but ubuntu is unaware and happy.  More evidence here that this is the ISP's fault\nIn short, check if your ISP is using local domain non-routable DNS IP addresses.  If so, switch DNS provider on ubuntu.\n\nA: According to the Avahi wiki there are two workarounds:\nBetter one:\nIn /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf uncomment and change the line with domain name to \ndomain-name=.alocal\n\nSecond one:\nIn /etc/nsswitch.conf delete a [NOTFOUND=return] text.\n\nA: It looks like avahi-daemon is started when the network connection is established (/etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon).\nThis notification is informing you that mDNS (Avahi) has been disabled. It's only used for a small number of applications that only work on the local network, it won't adversely affect your internet connection or DNS.\nThe most well known use for mDNS is sharing music with Rhythmbox (or iTunes) over your LAN. It's an Apple technology, but it's largely been ignored in favour of uPNP or DLNA.\nTo disable it, you must edit the file /etc/default/avahi-daemon as root:\nsudo -i\ngedit /etc/default/avahi-daemon\n\nand add this line (or change it if already exists to):\nAVAHI_DAEMON_DETECT_LOCAL=0\n\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1632952\n", "Q: Unable to mount windows partition after resize So what happened is I was creating a partition on my HDD (main one, no external ones) that could be accessed from both Windows and Ubuntu, one I could store files I would use on both in.

What's more, if you truly resized the partition to its minimum size (that is, so that you had 0 free space), you might have created complications, since there's little room for fixing problems on a 100% full partition.\nThat said, Linux has no good NTFS repair utilities.

Couldn't I just make the source to the GPL libraries available (if modified)?\n\nIf the answer is \"You need a commercial license\", are there any cheaper alternatives you know of (like royalty-based payments instead of up-front developer fees)?\n\nA: Simply put: If you don't understand the terms of the licenses of the software you're using enough to interpret if what you're suggesting \"is okay\", you need to talk to a professional who does. If you want to seek a deal directly with the license owners, that works too but you'll still need to understand how licensing works.\n\nLike Eliah, I'm also not a lawyer and when you're sued for following my advice, you can't say I didn't warn you. I generally agree with Eliah but I think in this case, Python is a bit different.\nGPL software allows you to redistribute something as long as you provide it under the same license. In this case you would be redistributing PyQT which you can do. You'd also be distributing your product. I personally don't see why you can't do both as long as you make the source available for the GPL things you're using. You aren't integrating them into your Python, you're just using them.\nTo further describe what I'm talking about, if you included a library in a C project and compiled it down, you'd end up either the GPL code in your binary or you'd be creating static libraries that your code linked to (statically or dynamically). The FSF will demand you make your code available by GPL if you redistribute their protected code.\nSee the difference? Python's text-based distribution means the linking is pretty dynamic: There aren't static \"links\" to GPL code and the reference to PyQT could be substituted in a different environment. You are just using its API.\nIf you search for \"python import gpl\" you will find many, many arguments in both directions from many, many non-lawyers. This isn't a simple argument and if it did come to a lawsuit, you can be damned sure everybody on the free software side of the bench would be throwing everything at it to make sure a negative precedent was set.\nSo once again, you're probably not qualified to make this decision alone. Either talk to a lawyer or look at how much that would cost you and work out that it'll be cheaper just to pay for the commercial licenses.\nIgnoring licensing will work out much more expensive.\n\nA: \nI am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. This post is about what options you have, so it's a research tool, intended to be used alongside other research tools. Even in combination with other research tools, this is no substitute for consulting an attorney about any legal matter where you need a proper answer.\n\nOne of the license options for Qt (not PyQt) is the LGPL 2.1, which allows you to distribute proprietary programs that use the Qt library provided that you abide by all the terms of the LGPL 2.1.\nPyQt, however, currently only has two licensing options (unless you negotiate something else with its developers, which would not ordinarily be practical). It is available under the GPL--then to distribute your program it would have to be free open source software; more specifically, any version of your program that you offer to others and that uses the PyQt library would have to be licensed under the GPL as well.\nThe only alternative to the GPL, for a program that uses PyQt, is to pay for a commercial license. As you indicated, this is often prohibitively expensive (though for some applications it's a good deal).\nIf your goal is to write a GPL-incompatible program in Python that uses Qt, you may want to consider PySide. Like PyQt, PySide is a Python binding for Qt, that lets you write Python programs that use Qt. Unlike PyQt, PySide is available under the LGPL (like Qt itself), and thus can be used by proprietary programs provided that you carefully read and abide by the terms of the LGPL.\nSometimes, PyQt has significant advantages over PySide. Often, it does not. There is also an element of subjectivity regarding which you may prefer to use; different programmers have different preferences. For more information, see Differences Between PySide and PyQt.\n", "Q: Atheros QCA9565 / AR9565 Wireless Card Doesn't Work After Updating Today I bought my first laptop with Ubuntu installed.\nEverything was working, until I decided to make the update. \nI used the update manager, installed all the updates, but then my wireless stopped working.\nI went to the DELL site, where I created an account, but due to the fact that some tools only work with IE (and they suggest to install it!! can't believe...), when I select my laptop model to download the drivers the answer is 0 results...

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nI keep getting this when I download anything from the terminal.  How do I get around this?\n\nA: Ferramosca Roberto's Java PPA doesn't seem to be up anymore. This is a PPA for Sun/Oracle Java; my guess is that licensing changes preventing up-to-date versions (later than 6u26) from being provided, so after a while he no longer considered it useful to keep up. But that's just a guess.\nI recommend removing the PPA; this explains how; this may help too. I'd use ppa-purge for this, since you'll also want to remove the software provided by that PPA (and replace it with something up-to-date); this explains ppa-purge (this simple answer is probably all you need).\nThen, if you want to use Oracle's proprietary Java runtime, this explains how. That should achieve what you were using the ppa:ferramroberto/java PPA for before. Or you may prefer to use the OpenJDK (which is also official); for that, this might help.\nIn short, to remove the broken PPA with ppa-purge and install the latest stable version of Oracle's proprietary JDK, you can run:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:ferramroberto/java\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\nSource: This answer to that question (for the last three commands).\nUnlike some old PPAs, packages from that PPA can provide the latest versions of Oracle Java even with their licensing restrictions prohibiting distribution by unauthorized parties. The way this works is that the packages don't actually contain Oracle Java; instead, they contain scripts that automatically download them from authorized download sites, and install them. Meanwhile the packages manage what version is installed, so it works similarly to the way it would work if the packages did directly provide the software.\nJava 8 exists, and you can install it with oracle-java8-installer. But it's still in testing; it's not recommended for general use. Similarly, the old Java 6 still exists, though you should check to see if it still get security updates before using it. To install that, you'd use the oracle-java6-installer package.\n\nA: This error means, that one of the PPAs in your software sources is not accessible. Check if the PPA is still available and if yes update the entry in software source. If not, remove it from your software sources in order to get rid of the error. \nMaybe you should also remove all packages from that PPA, since without the PPA they will not be updated. There is a tool called ppa-purge, that will help you to revert anything from a certain PPA to the version from the original Ubuntu repos.\n\nA: This is generally because the PPA does not exist or does not have packages for you Ubuntu version. This could be because that the PPA has become unmaintained or no longer updated. You should try and find a new PPA for the package you want to install. It doesn't stop you from installing other packages which aren't in that PPA however. \nYou should search the internet for the PPA (which is the first part after lanuchpad.net/ and before /ubuntu), in your case, \"ferramroberto/java ppa\" . If it's a launchpad PPA, you should find a page with info about all packages and their versions\n", "Q: X does not start after removing parameters quiet splash I would like to remove the splash screen.

Fortunately I can press ctrl + alt + F1 and jump to terminal session. How to continue setup from terminal? If I would succeed to install lubuntu I could update video driver later, but now when my system is loaded from CD I do not understand what I could do else... just to continue process from terminal..\nDetails: boot menu and splash screen works fine but Installer (that one that contains wizard \"welcome/language list > choose timezone > choose name\") is corrupted: only half of the screen shows something recongnizable, mouse pointer is black square and left \"black trace\", click doesn't work etc, but keyboard works well so I am able to jump to terminal.\nlshw -c video and sudo lspci -k doesn't show the video driver! May be somebody could explain what does it mean?\nI have made some experiments with boot string setting vga=XXX and some other boot string options. Splash screen react on them very clearly, but Installer in most cases ignores them. It seems Installer loads another driver. How could I prevent do to it from boot string options? Is it possible to say \"use vesa\"?\nOf course: sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop doesn't work as I need, but may be it is possible from terminal a) mount to the notebook's disk b) install lubuntu to this disk and make this disk bootable?\n\nA: Boot string parameters nomodeset xforcevesa helped me to launch installer without video problems.

I have tried memtest86+ from different liveCDs but when I click on start....it reboots. My laptop has been kinda slow lately...so I decided to test it and this is what happened. It is really weird. Is there a way to find out what causes the problem? Or what went wrong on the hardware side of my laptop?\nUPDATE: I individually tested the 2 memory sticks and it restarted in both of the cases. I highly doubt both memory sticks are corrupted. How can they both get corrupted at the same time. Weird.\n\nA: I think that this can be the signal of the presence of a big problem on your RAM.\nHow many slots of RAM do you have? \nIf more than one, you can physically remove one of them, then try again with memtest+.\nIf still not working, remount it, unmount another slot and try memtest+, and so on until you find the damaged one. When you find it, you can either decide to remain with less RAM or buy another one. If the latter, take the damaged one to the store and buy another similar, otherwise it might happen that your BIOS won't recognize the whole RAM, but just a part of it.\nIf you have only one slot, the unique is to find a friend which lend you one of her/his and do again the memtest+.\nIf you do not find a damaged RAM (aka all the previous memtest+ fail / go right) the problem is somewhere else, maybe directly with the Motherboard.\nIn this case I suggest that you take your pc to a store.\nWARNING: if your pc is still under warranty avoid any of the above and take it where you bought it, because opening it to remove the RAM will cause the warranty to become void.\n", "Q: How can I prevent apt-get/aptitude from showing dialogs during installation?

What can I do? Right now, my available disk space on Ubuntu is very low, and I want to increase it. My main drive has several partitions on it. I have a main partition for windows, a 900mb partition which I believe Ubuntu is installed on, and a 13gb partition that contains /home for ubuntu. While running Ubuntu, I got a message that I was low on disk space. \nI want to know what my options are. Is it possible for windows and /home to share the same partition? Is there a better way to dual boot ubuntu? \nThanks for the help\n\nA: You can re-format your computer and put more space for ubuntu. It's not possible that windows and ubuntu use the /home partition, because it has a different filesystem that windows can't use. So, you can use gParted for editing the size of your partitions on a live cd.\n\nA: You can reformat you HDD/SSD using the following tool: gparted and then adjust both partitions to the size you need/want.\nIf you don't have gparted already, please open a terminal window and the copy/paste the following:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nSo there is no need for you to use a LiveCD if you don't have one, as i think gparted it's not a heavy program.\nBeware to have a backup of all of your files, just in case something goes wrong, which is very rare to happen.\nI believe that the main partition where Ubuntu is installed (the 900MiB one) is the one that is causing you trouble.\nTry to allocate some more space to the partition where you have Ubuntu installed via GParted. The program is very straightforward to use.\nHope i've helped you.\nNuno Machado\nEDIT: Windows and Ubuntu are incompatible on filesystem level, as Windows uses NTFS and Ubuntu EXT filesystem, so logically, they cannot share the same space or partition.\nNeither Windows can 'see' EXT filesystems. Luckilly Linux can 'see' NTFS filesystems, as you will see when you use GParted tool.\n", "Q: Auto mount server Secondary hard disk shared folder to client I was tried to Mount server secondary hard disk shared folder to my client computer.

I also have no sound, but this question is about screen resolution.\nThe panel in the PC has a native resolution of 1680 x 1050. I can't find any further information than that, including refresh rate. Graphics are Intel. On first install the screen defaults to a low resolution at top-left of the screen, the remainder being filled with repeats of the far-right and bottom pixel columns/rows. I can change the resolution to a higher one in Ubuntu settings, but the native resolution does not appear in the list. Also there's a second panel detected even though I don't have one connected. I understand this may be something to do with an HDMI output though, even though it's not in use.\nI tried adding it with xrandr but the area outside the maximum resolution in the list (1600 x 1200) is hidden (the mouse pointer disappears behind the repeating pixels). So I got to work looking on the forums to create an xorg.conf file with an appropriate Modeline and various options to force X to only use one screen (which works) and to ignore the false EDID information from the screen and use the Modeline instead. Everything I try, however, seems useless.\nHaving checked Xorg.0.log, this section seems to apply (it's also repeated a few times):\n[  1439.982] (II) intel(0): EDID for output LVDS1\n[  1439.982]

After I replaced 1366x768 with 1024x768 matrix. It still makes video out for 1366 dots per line. Drivers reports \"Error\" on EDID Any attempts to change driver were not lucky.\nIt looks Intel driver ignores modeline at all. And I have no ideas how but setup software controls reals settings of resolution out of options from driver. Which makes them out of its own judgment, sometimes out of EDID sometimes out some macabre witchcraft, but not out of modeline settings.\n", "Q: Gameplay/openGL performance issues with AMD APU I recently built a new desktop with an AMD A10-6800K (Radeon HD 8670D) APU. Basic graphics performance was fine with the open source drivers, but I installed fglrx* because I wanted to enable sound through the HDMI port.\nIt works like a charm for playing videos (no problem with fullscreen 1080p), but today I decided to try playing Supertuxkart for the first time on this machine. The result was very poor - the sound was choppy, the video lagged, and even moving the mouse around on the setting screen was jumpy. Oddly enough, my system monitor was not showing particularly high CPU or RAM usage at the time. \nIf anyone has any suggestions on sorting out the gameplay issues, I'd appreciate it. The only things I can think of are trying out the open source drivers (which cuts off the sound output to my tv) or the beta driver from AMD, but maybe there is some other configuration I can try.\n*I installed the (non-beta) drivers from the AMD website since both fglrx and fglrx-updates in the Ubuntu repos were showing an \"unsupported hardware\" watermark, but this didn't come up with the one from AMD. I've also enabled hardware acceleration.\nOther info: even running glxgears causes trouble. It's fine in the small window (and even returns over 1500 fps) but enlarging the window causes the framerate to drop (to a still-respectable 200 fps) but the playback becomes choppy and again, the mouse cursor no longer moves smoothly. It seems like this is probably an overall openGL issue.\nUpdate: using the fglrx-updates package from the Ubuntu repositories gives much better performance, but leaves me with an \"unsupported hardware\" watermark.\nThe open source Radeon drivers work OK for video and display management, but leave games like Supertuxkart unplayable.\n\nA: Update:\nAccording to AMD website, the 13.04 driver is not compatible with your APU, but the 13.08 beta driver is. \nCatalyst 13.04 release notes:\nhttp://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/amdcatalyst13-4linreleasenotes.aspx\nCatalyst 13.08 release notes:\nhttp://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/AMDCatalyst13-8LINBetaDriver.aspx\n\nFor AMD graphics you need to use the proprietary drivers from AMD website, any other driver will not work properly. It's also important to use the latest version of Ubuntu, since the driver needs up-to-date Kernel, X.Org and Mesa packages to achieve full performance.\nYou can try removing all AMD drivers from your system and start from the beginning, with the Catalyst driver from AMD website.\nTo remove all drivers from you system and go back to the open source driver, run the following commands:\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\n\nRemove your X.Org conf:\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nReinstall X.Org and open source drivers:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:amd64 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:amd64 xserver-xorg-core\n\nReconfigure X.Org:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nAnd then reboot the system:\nsudo reboot\n\nTo install Catalyst from AMD website you will need to install the following packages:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic dkms ia32-libs\n\nDownload the driver and run the following commands to install:\ncd Downloads\n\nchmod +x amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run\n\nsudo sh amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run\n\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\n", "Q: Cannot connect to WiFi Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01) I just installed Ubuntu 13.04 with my Pavilion dv6.

I'm pretty new to Ubuntu and Linux in general.

I checked out debfoster thinking it was the best thing in the world, and then I went to Aptitude once I figured out it was depreciated.\nThough I'm basically looking for something that is going to keep track of packages I install and they're dependencies, and uninstall everything in the case that I don't want that package instead of just keeping the dependencies on my system.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated!\n\nA: You can use apt-get on Ubuntu. Look at Community HowTo.\nOther package managers:\n\n\n*\n\n*aptitude (same as apt-get, just a bit less friendly)\n\n*npm - Node package manager\n\n*gem - Ruby package manager\n\n*bower - package manager for the web\n\n*component - another package manager for (better) web\n\n\nA: The default package manager in ubuntu, apt (install a package with sudo apt-get install PACKAGE) does this itself.\nFor example, if package foobar depended on packages foo and bar and you removed foobar, it wont be automatically removed but foo and bar will be removed when you run the command sudo apt-get autoremove\nIt should be noted that apt-get autoremove will only remove an auto installed dependency if no other packages need it, to prevent breaking your system\naptitude is a good tool if you want to read detailed info about a package (without installing it) and it's dependencies or if you are unsure of a package's name and want to search for it\n", "Q: SSD: Support for SATA 3.1 and \"queued TRIM\" I have a relatively new Thinkpad 530 running Xubuntu 13.04.

If so, fdisk will be useless on the disk, because fdisk manipulates partition tables, and your disk has no such data structure. It's valid to create a filesystem on the whole disk in this way, but it's unusual; it's much more common to create a partition table on the disk, even if you intend to use the whole thing as one filesystem. Since you didn't report device filenames with your other commands, it's unclear whether you've actually set things up in this way or if you have some sort of problem. You might be able to figure it out by using blkid, as in:\n$ sudo blkid /dev/sda\n/dev/sda: UUID=\"a139b90e-2f94-4378-bf66-fe7669808dbe\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nThis example shows that /dev/sda does indeed hole a valid ext4 filesystem. You can also look for device files for partitions in /dev, as in:\n$ ls /dev/sda*\n/dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda2  /dev/sda3  /dev/sda4  /dev/sda5\n\nThis example, contrary to the earlier one, shows that /dev/sda is partitioned -- that's what the files that end in numbers refer to.\n", "Q: Downgrading Rhythmbox 2.99 to 2.97 without losing Playlists I installed Rhythmbox 2.99 on Ubuntu 12.10 following the instructions here and here.\nThis version of Rhythmbox seems to be a little buggy and I would like to downgrade to 2.97, but I want to do this without losing my personal settings (playlists).

I'm not sure if this means that I have both versions installed. When I open Rhythmbox, it opens 2.99 and that's the only version that appears when I search in the dash.\nI appreciate the help.\n\nA: The version you have manually compiled and installed as actually been installed into a system local folder - /usr/local/lib/rhythmbox - thus any binaries (executables) take precedence over your current v2.97 install which is in /usr/lib/rhythmbox\nTo uninstall your system-local version, you need to run the uninstall routine from the folder you initially extracted, compiled and installed in.\nFor example, lets say you extracted v2.99 in ~/Downloads/rhythmbox-2.99\ncd ~/Downloads/rhythmbox-2.99\nsudo make uninstall\n\nThis will remove all traces of the local version, leaving you with the default system version of rhythmbox that is still installed.\nIt is safe to do this, since your local playlists are stored in your home folder in the folder ~/.local/share/rhythmbox.

If yes, How will it be done?\nSome days are hot and the laptop sometimes gave in to it sometimes. \nI have Ubuntu 13.04 and the laptop is Compaq Presario CQ42-357TU.\n\nA: Normally, OS do an Emergency Shutdown whenever the die reach a certain temperature which in your case is 90°C.\nWindows and Ubuntu (any Linux distribution) has different ways to deal with overheating, so it's not necessary that Ubuntu (any Linux distribution) respond the same to overheating.\nI don't know how to change this behavior, you should ask another question for this.

As a new user I can understand your concern, but here we follow  few rules so that you can get a good answer. First rule is don't ask many question in one topic. You are free to create as many question as you want. Second is do some search before posting the answer. Read this and help us to give a good answer next time time - https://askubuntu.com/help/asking\nHere are your answers,\n\n\n*\n\n*I think you want to say uninstall not deinstall. All your installed software are listed in software center. Just hit Win and search for software center. There you can search for the app you want to install/ uninstall. The installed one are marked with green tick.See the below image. click on the entry and you will get uninstall button. From command line you can do by sudo apt-get remove <package_name> (but remember package name may be different from application name)\n\nThe  application you installed (as I am guessing) are special web apps. You can have a look in this question too How do I remove a website from Ubuntu's web applications? \n\n*regarding list of installed app, again you can open software center and see Installed tab. See above screen shot\nor you can hit win, keep pressing ctrl+tab (or click on the application scope in below) and see details. See the screenshot below. You can just type on the name to search any application after pressing win\n\n\n*And connecting to a wedav account, I recommend another application. Nautilus has changed since that tutorial was written. This answer goes as a task for you, you can easily install an application named Gigolo. So to do so, as I told, search and open software center, search for Gigolo and install it. From there it is pretty easy. \nEnjoy ubuntu and comeback if you need more help.\n", "Q: Error while launching Wakfu I installed Wakfu on my Ubuntu 12.04 from the source downloaded from the game website. \nBut while opening it the following error came up:  \n '/opt/ankama/Wakfu/Wakfu' \nThe archive /opt/ankama/Wakfu/core.jar does not exist.  \n\nI also installed sun java.

Whenever I use Windows 8, restart the machine and then boot Ubuntu (13.04) with grub boot-loader, Ubuntu freezes during the boot. I do not get to the login screen. However if I power off my machine after this occurs and power it on again Ubuntu boots just fine. Any suggestions on why this might be occurring and how to resolve it?\n\nA: This sounds like a hardware initialization problem -- Windows has left some hardware device in a state that Linux doesn't like, resulting in a hang. You might be able to learn more by removing the quiet and splash kernel options (by editing your boot options in GRUB). This will result in verbose startup messages, which may provide a clue about what hardware device is the source of the problem. With that information in hand, perhaps you could research it better and find a fix.\nFailing that, I suggest you try hitting your computer's reset button (if it has one) during the reboot process. That might reset the hardware adequately, but I can make no promises. Another option might be to drop to a GRUB command line and issue a reboot command before booting Linux. It's conceivable, but unlikely, that GRUB's reboot operation would do a better job of resetting the hardware than Windows' reboot operation.\n", "Q: Why won't XBMC play my DVDs?

I sometimes hide the video player and only listen to music. But it still uses the processor, and my computer gets hot. \nIs there a way to temporarily disable video output and only play audio, without extraction or conversion?\n\nA: I don't think you can do this with the default video player on Ubuntu (totem) but with VLC media player you can easily disable the video stream of a media file and only let the audio play (or vice versa):\n\nWith this method settings won't be preserved across different files/loops of the same file. A more permanent solution is disabling video playback from the preferences menu:\n\n\n\nA: I doubt that totem allows this. If you use mplayer, there is a command line switch for that purpose: -novideo. If the -novideo option does not work, you can instead use the -vo null -vc null options, and if that fails, you can just choose a nonexistant -vo driver. For more details, read the mplayer man page.\nmplayer -novideo <filename>\nmplayer -vo thisoutputdriverdoesntexist <filname>\nmplayer -vo null -vc null <filename>\n\n\nA: vlc --no-video <media>; should do the trick without \"permanently\" disabling VLC's video-playing capability.\n", "Q: I need help with my Ubuntu touch so I flashed and everything was well but after tinkering a while I ran across some problems \nfirst off a lot of my settings don't work, some of the apps don't either for ex the camera app just goes to a white screen. and the computer doesn't recognize it.\nits a nexus 4 and I'm running Ubuntu on my laptop. not sure if its a bad flash, I tried to download the update but it keeps failing.\n\nA: The current version of Ubuntu Touch (the Ubuntu operating system for phones and tablets) is a Developer Preview.

For at least few applications (e.g. firefox), as it wouldn't be possible to automatically do that for all of them.\nOr, maybe, it is possible to set the scrolling step on the touchpad and in the applications very small? There'd be the event-flood problem but probably not very critical.\n\nA: A partial answer is:\nid=`xinput list | grep -Po \"[Tt]ouch[^=]*id=[0-9]+\" | grep -Po [0-9]+`\nprop_id=`xinput --list-props $id | grep -P \".*[^C][^i][^r][^c][^u][^l][^a][^r]\\sScrolling Distance\" | grep -Po '\\([0-9]+\\)' | grep -Po \"[0-9]+\"`\nxinput --set-prop \"$id\" \"$prop_id\" 15 15\n\nto make the scrolling step smaller; after that, in Firefox there are mousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_x and mousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_y which can be changed to make the scolling distance on each step smaller as well.\nSetting the scrolling distance much less than 15 (in my case) makes scrolling in quite a few applications unusable.\n", "Q: evolution -> thunderbird migration and archive size I just migrated my email from evolution 3.2.3 to thunderbird. As that version of evolution is already storing email in maildir format I exported all folders by hand into mbox format (from within evolution, doing select all + save as) and then imported them in thunderbird with ImportExportTools. This has somehow caused a dramatic size increase of my mail archive.

After importing everything into thunderbird it did not really get smaller. The two archives really contain the same data. Does anyone know how this is possible?

When I restarted, Windows was booted.\nI can't find the 200 GB partition on Windows. When I try to boot again from the USB it went directly to the install screen. Where did the hard drive space go? How can I boot from the partition where I installed Ubuntu?\n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu!\nBecause of the fact that you installed Ubuntu on an ext4 partition, Windows can't \"see\" it, and so it doesn't even recognize that the disk space is there. To have Windows see the partition it would have to be set up on a Microsoft format (FAT, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS). Ubuntu/Linux can see/read Windows formats, but Windows can only read Microsoft formats.\nAs for the reason that you can't start Ubuntu, did the computer do anything, or did it just boot directly to Windows. I guess I should ask, did you watch the computer the entire time it was booting? \nGRUB, the Boot Loader that allows you to choose the OS you want to load (Windows, Ubuntu, etc.) only displays the choice for about 10-15 seconds before automatically booting the default choice. If you didn't watch the entire time and explicitly choose Ubuntu, it may have accidentally booted Windows instead of Ubuntu.\nBest of Luck on solving your problem!\nEDIT:Problem Solved!\nQuote: @Shubhanyu Veldurthy\nMy problem is solved.

If Secure Boot is disabled, change shimx64.efi to grubx64.efi; and if you've installed another boot manager (such as rEFInd or gummiboot), you should change the entire pathname to refer to it. Whatever you use as a filename, be sure that it exists on S:.\n\n\nThere are other ways to deal with this problem, too, such as running Boot Repair from a Linux live CD or installing rEFInd.

I am using an apache web server currently on my Ubuntu system running 12.04 to display backed up movies, music, and photos. I am in the process of coding it to make it more appealing to people who use it, but I am having trouble removing the Apache default directory contents list and replacing it (looks like below).\n\nHow would I remove this default directory contents list and display my content in a grid-style with thumbnails?\nIn reply to gertvdijk's comment, what extra modules or extensions would I need?\n\nA: This gives you a brief description of the Apache alternates, and how to customize Apache directory listing.\nLet me start by saying that: \nThe Apache HTTP Server is the most popular web server on the Internet running on almost 60% of all web servers and also the one we now compare all others to. Apache’s security, stability and flexibility is why most web server administrators choose it and Apache has proven itself over the long run.Apache\nOther alternatives that are available out there are:\nLighttpd (pronounced “Lighty”) was born out of a desire to create a fast, secure and reliable web server with a small memory footprint. From a functional standpoint it works much the same as Apache, the most widely used web server, but with less memory used on busy servers and also greater throughput when pushed to its limit. It currently powers several extremely high traffic websites such as Wikipedia and YouTube.Lighttpd\nNginx is bit of a different beast. While it does work as normal it is mainly utilized across higher trafficked websites as a web proxy; in other words when a user visits the nginx server with their browser it will send the request to other servers on its own private network depending on the type of content requested.\nDocumentation is not clear for beginners, but once you get to know the ins and outs of nginx you will see how powerful it is especially when running larger sites.Nginx \nInformation is available on the internet,  and you may need to do some Googling to find specific instructions for your situation.\nFor customization, take a look at Better Default Directory Views with HTAccess\nQuoted form the site:\n\nBeautify your default directory listings! Displaying index-less file\n  views is a great way to share files, but the drab, bare-bones\n  interface is difficult to integrate into existing designs. While there\n  are many scripts available to customize the appearance and\n  functionality of default directory navigation, most of these methods\n  are either too complicated, too invasive, or otherwise insufficient\n  for expedient directory styling. In this comprehensive tutorial, you\n  will learn how to use the built-in functionality of Apache’s\n  mod_autoindex module to style and enhance your default directory\n  views with a smorgasbord of stylistic and functional improvements.\n\nAlso take a look at Official Manual\n\nA: Look at my website: https://wrcraig.com/ApacheDirectoryDescriptions. It goes beyond the default directory description, providing a spreadsheet to assist in creating detailed descriptions and exporting them in FancyIndex/AddDescription format for inclusion in .htaccess.\nIt also provides a menu driven BASH scripted alternative, using the FancyIndex descriptive data above (automatically adding A/V durations) to recursively populate index.html while retaining the security features of .htaccess.\nThe site has examples of the input spreadsheet and both the FancyIndex output and the optional BASH scripted output.\n", "Q: Is there an official list of trusted Ubuntu system processes? List of default processes -- these running after fresh system install and after first system update. Both these most important and startup processes and these less.\nPreferably maintained by Canonical and/or Ubuntu community itself.\nIs there such thing?\n\nA: I really wouldn't place much confidence in the \"trusted lists\" your mentioning. I used to work with a company that used a website that listed \"trusted processes\" for windows through automatic generation. It was very imprecise and its sole purpose was to to get users to buy their products so they could \"fix\" the user's computer.\nIf canonical maintains such a list i am not aware of it - but i think its very hard and very impractical for such a list to exist.\n\nA: If you only use the Linux and canonical repositories, how can you get untrustworthy processes?  If you have untrustworthy repositories, you should deal with that, and any packages that came from said repository.  If not, then you're golden.

That part works great, and the MIDI keyboard sounds great.\nHowever, once that MIDI keyboard is connected, my computer immediately becomes unable to output ANY sounds other than sounds from the MIDI keyboard, and this continues until I reboot the computer, even if I stop and close both qsynth and qjackctl.\nI have no idea what's causing this, but I find it really annoying. How can I stop it from happening?\nMy Ubuntu version is 13.04 (Raring) and I have qsynth 0.3.6 and qjackctl 0.3.9. My system uses pulseaudio 1:3.0-0ubuntu6 to output sound, which I've heard has some problems but I'm not sure if this is one of them.\n\nA: If you're using jack to route your audio, then the jack server will take exclusive control of  your sound devices, thus making pulseaudio unable to output any audio for other applications.\nThis is what you want when using low-latency audio, as pulseaudio isn't designed for low-latency work. However (as you've noticed), it means that when you're done, pulse isn't able to output any more sounds.\nThe solution should be to stop the jack server when you're done with qsynth, so that the sound devices are available to pulseaudio again. The 'Stop' button on the qjackctl main UI should do this for you.\nYou may also need to quit and restart pulse after doing this; use can use pactl to exit the pulse daemon:\npactl exit\n\n- and the daemon should automatically restart when you next play audio.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu from ISO image directly from hard disk of a system running Linux?

A set of command line steps would be satisfactory. In my mind, I simply need to trick the existing system into thinking I inserted a CD/DVD, right?\nI know there is a similar question already but it does not have a good answer. The answer basically says, \"see this link.\" I reviewed the link and I decided that StackExchange needs a good answer to this question. Furthermore, most answers at other places on the Internet assume the user is coming to Ubuntu from Windows. So I think this question is one that needs a good answer here. Thanks\n\nA: I couldn't use Mitch's answer because I wanted to install Ubuntu minimal and the ISO image didn't work (there's no vmlinuz).  So instead I adapted it to use NetbootInstall\nI put the downloaded files into /boot/netboot and added the following entry to the grub config:\nmenuentry \"NetInstall\" {\n    linux (hd0,0)/boot/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/linux\n    initrd (hd0,0)/boot/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz\n}\n\nI then forgot to run\nsudo update-grub\n\nso I had to boot into the existing linux once again, but having finally updated grub the actual installation went very smoothly.\n\nA: I found this looking around on the net.\nGrub2 is capable of directly booting ISO images for many Linux distros if the entries have been properly defined in the Grub2 configuration files.\nThe ISO image must be placed on a separate partition that does not have an operating system installed on it. For the sake of simplicity, we would place it inside a new directory under /boot (assuming it is on a separate partition).\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the new directory and copy your ISO image:\nsudo mkdir /boot/iso\nsudo cp ~/Desktop/name.iso /boot/iso\n\nWhere ~/Desktop/name.iso is the location and name of your ISO image assuming that the image is located at your desktop.\n\n*Add the Grub2 entry:\nThe entry for the ISO image needs to be added to /etc/grub.d/40_custom file.

'hd0' means first HDD which is read as sda by Ubuntu, and 8 is the partition which is the same as for Ubuntu. So in other words, (hd0,8) means 'sda8'.\nTo find out your partition, run this command in a Terminal:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nSuppose your image is contained in the sda1 partition, you'd change (hd0,8) in the above line to (hd0,1) and if the image is in the sdb1 partition, you'd change (hd0,8) to (hd1,1).\n\n*Save and close this file and now run this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Reboot and choose the new ISO entry from Grub menu this time. Hopefully, it will boot successfully to the desktop.\nNow, if you want to perform an installation from the same ISO, you'd need to unmount the ISO image first as it is mounted from a partition on your HDD (probably you've got a single HDD and want to install Ubuntu to the same HDD) and the installer needs to unmount any mounted partitions before it can make any changes.\nSo, from the Live CD environment, go to a Terminal and run:\nsudo umount -l /isodevice\n\nThat's all. Now you can double-click the 'Install' icon at the desktop and proceed with the installation.\nMore info see Ubuntu Forums 1, and Ubuntu Forums 2\nSource:TuxGarage\n", "Q: Will Windows fixmbr upset Ubuntu I have a home PC dual booting Windowx XP with Ubuntu 12.04.\nI have been using GParted and changing some sizes of various partitions to use some extra available free space.\nIt occurred to me that if I upset anything I can rescue the Windows MBR using various approaches including the Windows/DOS FDISK method, but would that effectively destroy Ubuntu/Grub boot loading by resetting the boot record back to the original Windows XP entry only? \nPerhaps it's a strange question and I hope that makes sense.\n\nA: If you use the fixmbr command in Windows, then assuming it succeeds, it will write the Windows boot loader to the Master Boot Record. That will overwrite the part of GRUB (Ubuntu's boot loader) that is installed to the MBR, and you will not have an option to boot Ubuntu.\nHowever, that's not usually a big problem, as it's quite easy to put Ubuntu's boot loader back in the MBR:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n(Applies even if GRUB is broken due to reasons unrelated to a recent installation of Windows--including fixmbr having been run--or even totally unrelated to Windows.)\n\n*Grub2/Installing: Fixing a Broken System (in the Ubuntu documentation wiki)\n\n\nThese methods will also often fix the same kinds of problems you might use fixmbr to fix. They will facilitate Ubuntu and Windows bootiing; fixmbr, at least as it is normally used, installs the Windows boot loader to the MBR, and results in a configuration that only boots Windows.\nFor boot problems, you may be interested in the Boot Repair utility.\nIf the problem is that the installed Windows system doesn't come up in the GRUB menu when you turn on your computer, it might be sufficient to run\nsudo update-grub\n\nin the Ubuntu system. (You can also run sudo os-prober but that should get run automatically when you run sudo update-grub.)\n", "Q: How can I get unformatted ip address information in the shell? I'm writing a shell script which needs information on the state of the network connection - the basic stuff like ip address, subnet, netmask and so on.\nI could just use ifconfig and sed/grep for the information, but I was hoping there was a cleaner way to do this - possibly using the ip command, or similar utilities. \nI'm looking for something which could give the following results:\n$ (magic command) ip\n192.168.1.1\n$ (magic command) netmask\n255.255.255.0\n$ (magic command) subnet\n192.168.0.0\n\nand possibly similar things for network gateway/dns servers.\nDoes such a command exist? Perhaps there's an --unformatted flag for ip or ifconfig? Am I too hopeful/naive?\nThanks :)\n\nA: The ip command supercedes the ifconfig command and supports the -o option for easier automatic parsing.\nFor example:\nip -o addr show dev wlan0|awk '$3==\"inet\"{print $4}'\n\nwill produce something like:\n192.168.0.2/24\n\n\nA: You can also use ifdata to get information without parsing output of ip with grep, awk or other tools:\n[~]$ ifdata -pa eth0\n192.168.246.161\n[~]$ ifdata -pn eth0\n255.255.240.0\n[~]$ ifdata\nUsage: ifdata [options] iface\n     -e   Reports interface existence via return code\n     -p   Print out the whole config of iface\n    -pe   Print out yes or no according to existence\n    -pa   Print out the address\n    -pn   Print netmask\n    -pN   Print network address\n    -pb   Print broadcast\n    -pm   Print mtu\n    -ph   Print out the hardware address\n    -pf   Print flags\n    -si   Print all statistics on input\n   -sip   Print # of in packets\n   -sib   Print # of in bytes\n   -sie   Print # of in errors\n   -sid   Print # of in drops\n   -sif   Print # of in fifo overruns\n   -sic   Print # of in compress\n   -sim   Print # of in multicast\n    -so   Print all statistics on output\n   -sop   Print # of out packets\n   -sob   Print # of out bytes\n   -soe   Print # of out errors\n   -sod   Print # of out drops\n   -sof   Print # of out fifo overruns\n   -sox   Print # of out collisions\n   -soc   Print # of out carrier loss\n   -som   Print # of out multicast\n  -bips   Print # of incoming bytes per second\n  -bops   Print # of outgoing bytes per second\n\n\nA: Well, you can try to grep and awk the information from the output like this: ip addr show eth0 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{ print $2}'\nYour output should look like this: 192.168.1.201/24\nip addr show eth0 gets you the information from eth0. grep 'inet ' is for IPv4. 'inet6' should be used for IPv6. awk '{ print $2}' simply reduces the output further to the second series of characters.\nThe netmask can be determined from the /24 after the IP address.\n\nA: Yes there is a way to make your own commands and get your information..\n\n\n*\n\n*To get your IpAddress save following command in any file say myipaddr:\nifconfig | grep 'inet addr:' | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -f2 -d:\n\n\n*Similarly to get NetMask save following command in file say  mymask:\nifconfig | grep 'inet addr:' | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | awk '{print $4}' | cut -f2 -d:\n\n\n*To get Bcast (subnet) save following command in another file say mysubnet:\nifconfig | grep 'inet addr:' | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | awk '{print $3}' | cut -f2 -d:\n\n\n*Then make all file executable and copy or move it to /bin directory:\n$ sudo chmod +x myipaddr mysubnet mymask\n$ sudo cp myipaddr mysubnet mymask /usr/bin\n\nNow to get your desired information you need to just open a Terminal and run any of this command.

I have it connected, and the configurations are set. This is what I see when I open zynaddsubfx: \n\nDefault I/O did not initialize. Defaulting to NULL backend.\n\nWhat does this mean and how do I fix this?\n\nA: I got this problem fixed by working with jack. Once I got jackctl set up, the problem disappeared. One of the biggest helps I found with qjackctl is this one here Ubuntu wiki How to JACK Configuration. \nI think this had to do with the Frames/Period. Basically this is the buffer for qjackctl as explained on the wiki. Working with the settings on this and a few other settings helped tremendously. \n\nA: I can't comment due to low rep.\nI had the exact same message \"zynaddsubfx default io did not initialize defaulting to NULL backend.\" right after before installing Qjackctl, when executing zynaddsubfx. So it is not neccesary to have qjackctl installed to have the bug. But there is a \"jack\" thing that controls midi that probably is that what you are talking about (sorry for being imprecise, midi in linux is difficult)\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04\nI tried a bunch of random things from the web on my Ubuntu 20.04 ZynAddSubFX 3.0.5, one of them worked and I get sounds out of the virtual keyboard, I'm just not sure which:\n\n\n*\n\n*run as:\nzynaddsubfx -O alsa -I alsa\n\nWithout -O alsa, I don't get any sounds still, so that option at least is crucial.\n\n*sudo apt install qjackctl\nsudo usermod -a -G audio $USER\n\nand log out and log in.\nAfter taking those actions, the error message does not show up anymore even without -O alsa -I alsa. But I get no sound without -O alsa.\n\nA: The message \"default I/O did not initialize\" is about default audio hardware initialization. It happens in three major cases:\n\n*\n\n*device absent\n\n*access to device blocked\n\n*device capabilities limited\n\nYou should check system current default audio hardware by\ncat /proc/asound/cards\n\nThe first list item is your system default (if any). You can set default device manually in /etc/asound.conf:\ndefaults.pcm.card 1\ndefaults.ctl.card 1\n\nCorresponding to list item number discussed upper.\nIn my case it was enough to disconnect usb midi-keyboard and restart alsa. Because somehow midi-keyboard became default audio.\n", "Q: 403 Forbidden clean apache2 install I recently reinstalled Ubuntu and then installed the lamp-server bundle via tasksel and the installation went fine.\nI had backed up the files from the /var/www/ folder and planned to just place them back once the server was back online (or in my case, accesible from my computer only - it's a test server.)\nThe installation completed and so I tried to copy the files over from the backup directory.

I have a Windows 8 Toshiba P75-A7200, and I've disabled Secure Boot, Fast Boot, and Fast Startup. Still, when I try to boot a Ubuntu 13.04 USB installer, I get to the GRUB screen and when I select \"Try Ubuntu Before Installing,\" it hangs on a black screen. I had also tried booting in Legacy Mode, and it was the same.\nThe answers that I've seen haven't helped me, since they seem to assume I can access the Ubuntu terminal? \nI've read this:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\nBut disabling secure boot and enabling BIOS Legacy Mode didn't help. My computer doesn't have an UEFI/BIOS option; only UEFI or BIOS.\nSame with this:\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nIt suggests the same things, which don't work.\nThey both assume that I can get to the Ubuntu installer.\nI've also tried to install Linux Mint, and it was still unresponsive. I used 64bit for both, of course.\nSo Ubuntu is supposed to be able to work with UEFI and secure boot. What's going wrong?\nPS It is a black screen, not a purple screen, so I don't think the problem is my video drivers, because I've had that happen on another computer. I know the problem is the UEFI, since I've installed Linux on three other Windows 7 computers just fine.\nEDIT: dd just try to switch to nomodeset, and that took me to the ubuntu command line. I tried startx which resulted in an error, so I am lost on how to proceed?\n\nA: Try these instead of nomodeset or in addition to nomodeset:\nacpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor \nSince you have a very new system, you may really need all the fixes that will be in 13.10 as both Kernel & Intel drivers have changes. But we only suggest 13.10 for those users who realize that is it not final, may crash and those bugs need to be reported so additionally fixes can be made. Or you are a tester not a user.\n\nA: I'm adding a link to a post I made on coderwall after figuring it out, in case anyone is reading this who is having the same problems I was: https://coderwall.com/p/ydbldg\nAt the GRUB screen: You can either try Ubuntu or just install it, but before I did this I had to press 'e' and then revise the script. Before \"quiet splash,\" I included \"acpi _ osi=Linux acpi _ backlight=vendor\". Then it should load without issue into the Ubuntu GUI.\nWhile installing, if the installer doesn't recognize the existing Windows OS, you will have to select the \"Something else\" option and manually partition. In the end, Windows 8 will still be there, so don't worry. Select the partition you created and within it create a swap partition at about 10% of the size of the partition itself. The video I linked above explains this much better than I can. Then complete the installation.\nIf you try to reboot the computer and it loads onto a black screen again, don't fear. Restart the computer using the LiveCD and install boot-repair from the LiveCD:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nIn boot-repair, just click on the \"Recommended\" button. It will fix the GRUB screen so you can see Ubuntu and Windows, although Windows is named something weird in the menu, it still works. Restart the computer.\nYou should see the GRUB screen. Select Ubuntu and press 'e'. Repeat step 4 so you can get into Ubuntu. To fix the black screen problem permanently, edit this line in /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB _ CMDLINE _ LINUX _ DEFAULT=\"acpi _ osi=Linux acpi _ backlight=vendor quiet splash\"\n\nThen in a terminal, do \"sudo update-grub\" and restart.\n\nA: I solved the issue by installing the Ubuntu system in BIOS uefi-disabled mode, then reinstall in uefi mode the black screen issue was gone.\n", "Q: Cannot install VLC due to unmet dependencies I am using a 32-bit version of Ubuntu, and I am trying to install VLC.

Lastly it is worth noting that RANDOMLY it will work after the install, meaning, the graphics driver just works, the screen does not blink on and off.  The only reason it doesn't still work is I've had to reinstall due to other issues.\nI am not very well versed in these things - but all I want to do is use my computer.  After about 75 days the OS is so buggy I have to reinstall.  But I suppose THAT part is neither here nor there as all I want at the moment is to get this graphics card working. \nI don't understand how if I set up a persistence file on my usb of Studio 13 how the changes I make will effect the installed version of Studio on my computers HDD.\nI found https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver and many other pages but none have helped fix my issue\nI could REALLY use some help here guys, not finding it in IRC either.  Anything would be greatly, greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I've had this problem as well on the default open-source drivers got AMD Radeon HD 6670. Installing the Catalyst driver fixed it. I've had to use the recovery mode to install it, though.\n", "Q: The terminal does not display Devanagri scripts (Hindi, Nepali, etc.) properly \nThe terminal is not combing Unicode characters correctly.

Where does my system put these by default (as far as I know I haven't changed the default location)?\nWhen I try to change the Firefox default application for magnet, I just get a file browser. Where do I point it? Where does Ubuntu store my programs, and what are their names? In Windows I'd look in \"programs\" for an .exe file with the same name as the program I want to use, what do I look for in Ubuntu? \n\nA: \nWhat do I do if I can't find the .torrent file?\n\nI would check your downloads folder for the .torrent file. Unless you have changed it--which you would probably remember having done--this is the Downloadsfolder inside your home folder.\nA .torrent file is not the same thing as a metalink. Although some BitTorrent programs support pasting in the URL of a .torrent file as though it were a metalink, a .torrent file is an actual file that can be downloaded to your computer and contains the important information about how to download a torrent.\nFiles you download in a web  browser are usually downloaded to the same location even if they are different types of file (unless you specified different locations at the time you downloaded each one). Thus the .torrent file is probably in the same folder that any other file you download in your web browser would end up in, which is typically your Downloadsfolder.\n\nA: The default for magnet links is /usr/bin/transmission-gtk. Transmission stores torrent files in .config/transmission/torrents,\nand, if you tell us what program you want to change it to, we might be able to help a little more.\n", "Q: I have to reload bashrc each time Despite the fact that I added some commands in .bashrc, I have to say \"source ~/.bashrc\" each time after rebooting.\n.bashrc\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin # Add RVM to PATH for scripting\nexport PATH=/opt/scala/sbt-0.12.2/bin:$PATH\n\nWithout saying \"souce ~/.bashrc\" the command sbt doesn't work.\nNo command 'sbt' found, did you mean:\n Command 'st' from package 'suckless-tools' (universe)\n Command 'sb' from package 'lrzsz' (universe)\n Command 'mbt' from package 'mbt' (universe)\n Command 'sbd' from package 'cluster-glue' (main)\n Command 'sb2' from package 'scratchbox2' (universe)\n Command 'skt' from package 'latex-sanskrit' (universe)\n Command 'sbmt' from package 'atfs' (universe)\n Command 'lbt' from package 'lbt' (universe)\nsbt: command not found\n\n\nA: Some basics: .bashrc is for interactive non-login shell, while ~/.bash_profile is for interactive login-shell.\nFor\n\n\n*\n\n*Interactive non-login shell, initialization order: System wide bashrc (SYS_BASHRC) default /etc/bash.bashrc => ~/.bashrc\n\n*Interactive login shell, initialization order: /etc/profile [^sysconfdir] => ~/.bash_profile => ~/.bash_login => ~/.profile.\nUbuntu by default uses ~/.profile to load ~/.bashrc, if ~/.bash_profile exists, ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc will NOT be loaded at shell initialization.\nSo make sure you don't have a ~/.bash_profile, put what you want in ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc.\n", "Q: Automatically deleted MySQL database table when restart server I installed LAMP server on my Ubuntu 12.04 Server PC.

I have just again run across the problem \"find out which packages I installed some certain days ago\". I have read several Q&A on askubuntu and there are always different ways suggested to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the history in the Software Center\n\n*use dpkg-query -l  (though I cannot seem to find any info on the install-date there\n\n*browse through /var/log/dpkg.log\n\n*(not to forget) the history in Synaptic Package Manager\n\n\nMy question is: Am I correctly assuming that the information received is not always the same. For instance it appears to me that the history solutions of Software-Center and Synaptic Package manager are only showing packages that they have handled \"themselves\". This means they omnit all those packages installed/removed/upgraded via the command line (i.e. via dkpg or apt-get).\nCan somebody help me out and (a) confirm that there is a difference and (b) maybe point out the differences to me. Most interesting there is also the question if \"installation date/time recordings\" are only available via the browse /var/log/dpkg.log.* method?\n\nA: Normally, the Ubuntu Software Manager and Synaptic track the package changes in their own log files, but that means that if you don't use these programs all the time the log will be incomplete and you will have problems trying to verify this.\nI didn't found in the manual for dpkg-query any clue that it provided the installed date, but dpkg-query -l indeed prints the general status of the packages, version, architecture and description.\nSo, who is more trustable? Obviously, all the package manager are in last instance frontends to dpkg who is the one that takes the actions of installation, configuration and deletion, and it's log is in /var/log/dpkg.log*. Now lets programmatically answer your questions:\n\nAm I correctly assuming that the information received is not always the same?\n\nAs I said above, yes. The programs are not running at every given time, and shouldn't be, hence they could ever keep track of every package change.\n\nCan somebody help me out and (a) confirm that there are a difference and (b) maybe point out the differences to me?\n\nYes, and the differences are above said.\n\nMost interesting there is also the question if \"installation date/time recordings\" are only available via the browse /var/log/dpkg.log.* method?\n\nIf you have a correctly set clock and used apt-get, obviously both logs, apt-get's and dpkg's, will log the same at the same time, with the same time. If you use apt-get all the time is understandable that you could read either log and have the same information. So, no, installation date and time recordings are available whatever logs you check (unless the logs are set to not print time), but dpkg's will always be more complete.\n", "Q: My home folder is owned by root, how can I fix this?

I would want to view the script results on the browser. I do not know where i am going wrong, still very much new to PHP.\n\nA: Your question is better suited to another StackExchange forum like StackOverflow, since it is about general Web programming that is not specific to Ubuntu per se.\nThat said, I see one flaw in your html in that you don't have a proper closing </form> tag. It would also be standard practice to have the form encoding included in the <form> tag as well, such as enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" And since your PHP page is not really reading any of the input of the form, the PHP page should function if you simply enter http://10.0.0.98/form.php in your browser.\n", "Q: Is ExFat a good compromise for sharing a hard drive between linux and windows? I am currently dual booting linux and windows on my primary SSD which is split with Ext4 and NTFS accordingly. However, I have a secondary hard drive where I would like to place my downloads and other large files. \nIdeally, I would like this hard drive to be accessible by both my linux and windows partition. \nAfter doing some research I saw that ExFat gives the benefits of Fat32 but with less restrictions regarding file size. Obviously using a non unix disk format would mean not being able to set permissions for files but I am ok with that. \nHowever doing some further research started to make me wonder whether linux has good drivers for ExFat since it is done over FUSE. What i would like to know is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is ExFat the best disk format to use or should I be using something else? \n\n*Are there any particular disadvantages i should be aware of because ExFat uses FUSE? \n\n*I also remember something about native ExFat drivers being leaked by Samsung recently. Is it easy to set these up on Kubuntu 12.04?\n\n\nA: Since exFAT is still closed source and encumbered by patents I believe a better, more stable solution would be to use an NTFS partition to share data between Linux and Windows. NTFS works out of the box on Ubuntu and you can easily access the partition from most live CDs.\nEven though totally feasible, I wouldn't recommend using exfat being there a more reliable alternative.\nAs per the leaked Samsung drivers, they have been subsequently released under GPL license (you can find them here) but in all honesty I would trust NTFS-3G better even if it's over the FUSE layer (Samsung is interested in their products, I doubt they test the code on systems/kernels other than their own).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 on UEFI system with Windows Boot Manager as the main loader On my old laptop (legacy BIOS, MBR disk), this was perfectly possible to get working:\n\n*\n\n*I turn on the computer and see the Windows Boot Manager\n\n\n*I use EasyBCD (or BootPart, or something else) to add an option to the BCD menu which allows me to boot into GRUB, and then into Ubuntu\nI can't figure how to do this on my new laptop (UEFI, GPT disk), whether in UEFI or legacy mode.\nCurrently I've installed (and even booted!) Ubuntu on my laptop, but only with the help of an external GRUB (on a USB flash drive).\nHow can I add GRUB as an option in the Windows Boot Manager on a UEFI laptop?\n(No, I don't want to change my primary boot loader. So no, I don't want to overwrite the Windows boot loader with GRUB.)\n\nA: AFAIK, you can't. To the best of my knowledge, the Windows boot loader doesn't provide any means to launch non-Windows EFI boot loaders. I could be wrong about this, though; I admit that my knowledge of the Windows boot loader is limited.\nInstead, you can configure any of a number of EFI boot loaders and boot managers for Linux to handle the boot-selection job. When everything works fine, GRUB can do this job; but as of version 13.04, Ubuntu doesn't set up GRUB correctly for dual-booting when it installs. There can also be other problems caused by EFI bugs. To work around the Ubuntu GRUB configuration problem, two solutions are easiest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Boot Repair on the system. If this works, it will re-install and reconfigure GRUB so that it can launch Windows.\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager. This is most easily done by installing the Debian package under Ubuntu. (Be sure that your ESP is mounted at /boot/efi, though.) Once installed, rEFInd should enable booting directly into Windows or directly into Linux, bypassing GRUB.\n\n\nNote that neither of these solutions completely replaces the Windows boot loader; they both just make another boot program (GRUB or rEFInd) run before the Windows boot loader. You can stop reading here if you like, but some background may be helpful in understanding this:\nWhen booting a multi-boot computer, a boot manager gives you a way to choose between two or more OSes, typically through a menu. Most EFIs include an awkward but built-in boot manager. rEFInd is also a boot manager, and GRUB includes a boot manager. A boot loader, by contrast, loads an OS kernel and any associated files and starts the kernel running. The EFI doesn't include a boot loader, so every OS must provide one. GRUB is a boot loader for Linux (but not for Windows) in addition to being a boot manager, the Linux kernel (since version 3.3.0) can function as its own boot loader, and Windows provides its own boot loader. rEFInd is not a boot loader; to boot Linux, it relies on the EFI stub loader or some other boot loader to load the kernel.\nThus, it's not possible to replace the Windows boot loader with GRUB, since GRUB is not a Windows boot loader. GRUB can use its boot manager features to chainload to the Windows boot loader, though.\n\nA: It is possible after all - adding .efi boot loaders into Windows Boot Manager but at least on my motherboard is a very bad idea because the change is permanent - eg. after booting to Ubuntu from Windows Boot Manager you will always boot to Ubuntu because it directly edits the UEFI boot config.\nAlso achieving this can be done only by manually editing the BCD file. You can check the accepted answer to this question: Windows 8.1 UEFI x64 is not able to boot-up UEFI Images for more details.\n\nA: Scenario is Windows boot manager is first boot choice on UEFI.\nYou can always use boot device selection key (F12 on DELL) from firmware which gives you the list of all installed OS as boot choice.\nIf the boot process is too fast you can always set Windows boot menu to text style with timeout say 10 seconds and from there escape to firmware boot selection using (ESC key on DELL, should be common).\nIf you are in Windows 7/8/8.1 and want to boot directly to Linux(Ubuntu) you can use a tool called BootNext which allows direct booting to any installed OS (Windows, Linux) on UEFI.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Lts not booting I installed ubuntu 12.04 LTS and it was working properly.

I have tried the hp's utility for checking wethter battery is working fine or not and the utility says that it is working fine, so where it the problem\n\nA: You probably have laptop which uses optimus technology. The idea behind optimus is that you have a weaker Intel based graphics card which will be used by standard applications that do not require much 3d power and an Nvidia graphics card which should be used by games, rendering software etc... Using this setup allows your laptop to benefit from increased battery life as well as good performance when required.\nUnfortunately, Nvidia has not shown much support for this technology on linux and as a result your Nvidia discrete chip will be turned on at all times when you are running Ubuntu. This results in much more power being used and why your battery is draining so fast.\nIn order to fix this, you can install bumblebee which will provide you with the power management required to give you a much longer battery life and the appropriate tools to run applications using the Nvidia chip when required.\nAs far as i know, the only thing bumblebee is currently missing is:\n * Automatic detection of when to run the nvidia chip (currently this has to be done manually by using the optirun or primusrun command)\n * HDMI out support if it is wired to your NVidia chip.\nOf course, this is all under the assumption that you are using an HP laptop that uses optimus technology - so you will need to check yourself with a bit of googling.\nEDIT: It is also possible to have hybrid technology with ATI graphics cards. I believe bumblebee still provides support for this - but i am not sure how well it does it.\n", "Q: How to allow LDAP user to change password?

I always let Ubuntu installation choose disk settings - partitions, file system and stuff.\nI believe that computer is good enough to run Ubuntu, why cant I get it working?\n\nA: This seems to be a bug with the open source Nvidia driver, nouveau.\nThe fix is simple but you'll have to use the command line to do it to avoid the screen corruption.

I'm thinking of upgrading the server OS to ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  My question is how do I achieve this and what are the implications on the running applications on the server? Is there any safe way to upgrade but also ensuring the installed application runs smoothly?\n\nA: There's a specific package for that, install it and run the upgrade:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThe upgrade will get you a new kernel, 3.2 in the case of 12.04. This means that all packages installed must be upgraded too, to versions compiled against the new kernel. Since 10.04 is now 3 years old, there might be some relevant changes to the software installed. Say that a particular application uses a different configuration method, after the upgrade you must change the old configuration to the new method.\nYou can do a search for the relevant packages to check the versions available for 10.04 and 12.04.

Because of extended desktop I only have DISPLAY=:0 and thus it is not possible to use DISPLAY=:1 or :0.1.\nI have a startup script which runs feh in startup and it does start on second monitor because it seems that the mouse pointer is about in the middle of the desktop. But the script runs feh over and over again to assure that feh gets refreshed file list in case there are new images in the directory (a shared dropbox folder). So if the cursor happens to be on main monitor (which it obviously is when using the computer) feh starts on it and I have to move mouse pointer to second monitor and kill feh.\nSo I was thinking if I would use two screens and define each monitor on its own screen but because of XFCE there is no xorg.conf to configure two screens.

I am using this both as a practical piece of equipment and as a learning experience with Ubuntu and Linux.\nI am having trouble determining the \"best practices\" for setting up such a server in a secure manner.

Is this true?\n\nIdeally you'll want to do this but it also depends on your setup. Will you have guests over that might want to access a folder on your server?  If so you can either share that folder through samba and give it 775 permissions, or you can create a \"guest\" user and give the folder 770 permissions and have you guests login as \"guest\" with a preset password.\n\nSamba and/or NFS (I will be connecting with Mac and Windows clients; should I use only Samba, or both?)\n\nIf you have Windows computers in the mix you'll have to use Samba, but it's typically slower than NFS.  I haven't had good experience with NFS on OSX but both are easy to setup but i'd start with Samba since it works with Windows, and OSX.  You can experiment with the NFS if you don't like Samba.  However with NFS you'll probably have problems with your UID not matching with your username on the server.\n/etc/samba/smb.conf is the file you'll want to edit to share files via samba.\nwith NFS you'll want to take a look into the /etc/exports file.\n\nWhat would be the proper layout of users and permissions to ensure that, for example, the directory where all my media files live is accessible to all while also keeping each service separated by user account?\n\nI would create a group (like \"users\") and when you create new users if you want them to have access to something like the \"media\" folder make sure they are in the \"users\" group and make sure the \"media\" folder is in the \"users\" group and that the \"users\" group has access to the \"media\" folder.\nThe way i do it on my server which runs a lot of similar programs is like so:\nAll media is in /opt/media and /opt/media belongs to the \"users\" group.  I then have a few accounts for me and my roommates that are all in the users group.  The file permissions for /opt/media are drwsrws--- \"s\" means that when my roommate \"bob\" drops a file in /opt/media it automatically belows to the group(users) that the parent dir belongs to. So now the file that \"bob\" created is owned by \"bob\" and in the \"users\" group. This is typically the setup you want when a log of different people are using a shared directory.\nWhat you want to do is a little complex and might change based on how many users are accessing the server and how your network is setup.  However hopefully what the above will put you on the right path.\n", "Q: How can I get older version of Flareget? I had just updated FlareGet download manager and it looks like the new version (1.5.12) allows fewer segments per download than the older one, 1.4.9 (4 instead of 8 - while the pro version offers 16).\n\nHow can I get back the older version?\n\nUPDATE: The newer 2.0 version has limited farther the number of segments per download: only 2 for the free version. It looks they are pushing hard their paid version. So, unless buying that, there's no point in upgrading.\nv. 2.3-24 allows a max of 16 connection/download but only 2 for a file over 25 MB.\n\nA: It looks like they're restricting connections-per-download to push the paid version.\nGiven that it's non-free and they control the downloads (and delete their old versions), I don't know what your options are here short of finding somewhere else that has held on to an old copy of one of their debs.\nI'd start looking in binary warehouses like Softpedia (they have it here) who tend to be pretty slow at deleting old things. Softpedia has already updated in this case, but others may have older binaries. Searching for the filename flareget_1.4-9_amd64.deb may work... But I shouldn't have to remind you what horrible security ramifications this has.\nI would personally just find something else. Axel, FlashGot, JDownloader2, FATRAT for some examples. There are many out there.\n\nA: Consider switching to uGet. http://uGetdm.com\nuGet is crazy fast, very stable, long track record and completely open source...so no feature restrictions.\nMore importantly for this case, uGet can make up to 20 connections/segments.\n", "Q: TV channel Identification using Linux C Programming I need to develop an application which will identify the channel name which is currently running in the Television. I am using Easy CaP Video capturing device to take the video in from the dth set top boxes. Currently i am used ffmpeg to cut it into frames . then i used Tesseract OCR to read the image contents. It does not seems to be perfect. So i need some other method to implement that. Can any one help me on implementing this application.\n\nA: Call me old fashioned, but OCRing the text out of a live frame is probably the last thing I would try. The text won't always be there (will it?) and it's just a horrible way of dealing with things.\nI think the only real option is to bring the capturing into the computer with a DVB card or USB stick. Then you control the channel rather than just receive it. Plus you get EPG access for free (in DVB-T/S/S2).\nIt's more hardware (and a slightly more convoluted setup) but much cleaner and easier to expand to handle other functions.\n", "Q: Where did my Nvidia optimus card go?

Now I restart and ... surprise!(actually not a surprise,something like this always happens) no UI, a low graphics mode message and there I am.  \nOf course I didn't check before the installation with lspci if I had an optimus capable PC because I HAVE AN OPTIMUS CAPABLE PC but doing lspci or checking in dmeseg output I don't see any trace of the nvidia word, my card just disapeared.  \nNow I don't know how to fix it or what could be the cause. I can only think of two options, a fairy opened my pc and stole the Nvidia chipset while I was sleeping or in the bumblebee time my card got disabled(bbswitch?) and now the system doesn't detect it. \n\nA: If you wish to get nvidia optimus working right out of the box, you can either install Suacy 13.10 which will give you nvidia optimus or you have install latest 12.04.3 which is LTS and has patched kernel, xrand R and will run fine as well. I have ASUS i7 laptop with Nvidia running very well with nvidia prime and nvidia optimus. The reason it didn't work in 13.04 is due to older xorg and xrandR.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 Wireless Hotspot Problems I had an Ubuntu 12.04 system which I recently upgraded to 13.04. I thought of trying to create a Wireless Hotspot that I could use to share my Mobile Broadband Connection with other devices. To that end, I went to the Network Settings -> Wireless Settings and pressed the Use a Hotpost button. But instead of asking me for a name of the hotspot connection and other details (as I had expected), the hotspot straight away asked me to turn the hotspot on. On doing so, I received a notification stating that I was now connected to the hotspot network and almost immediately afterwards it told me that I was disconnected from the network. The Wireless Network page still showed that I was connected to the specified hotspot. An idea on what might be going on with my system.\n\nA: There is problem with Ubuntu 13.04.

When I connect to the router via an ethernet cable, I can access the web with no problem. \nClear's tech support says they can't do anything from their end, and suggested I talk to Ubuntu's support (this is where you all come in). Has anyone figured out how to connect to a Clear Hub Express wireless signal via Ubuntu? \n\nA: I have the same exact problem. If you look at ifconfig you will notice you don't have a dns server. I can get it to work by plugging it in hard wired then it will retain the dns servers ip. You can then unplug and the wireless will work.

I have a Lenovo Ideapad running Windows 7 and I want to install Ubuntu on it. I already installed Ubuntu on a desktop machine using a boot dvd. When I run the installation process on my laptop I don't see the option Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7. \nI understand it's because I already have 4 primary partitions.

This is the first time I have tried to set up a home server. The installation seems to have been successful and now I am trying to understand my Internet connection.\nIf I ping google, I get 64 bytes from 67.215.66.132...(in fact, I get this over and over until I stop it). That seems promising.\nHowever, when I run ifconfig, it returns inet addr: 10.0.2.15. I'm not sure what kind of address this is. Maybe a local network address? It is not an address, I can access from a browser so I am not sure if my server is accessible from the outside.\nThe server is connected via ethernet to a Uverse router.\nUltimately, I want to try to host a single website on this server but I am wondering if I have to make more adjustments to my IP address before proceeding.\nAny feedback on the above would be appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: * VBox means VirtualBox, when used in this answer\n10.0.2.15 is an address that falls in the 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 range, which is a \"private network address\" range, per RFC 1918 (page 4, section 3 states \"private access space\" for LANs and Intranets and such). Like network addresses starting with 192.168.*.*, those typically are internal network addresses for the given local network, in this case the 'network' used by VirtualBox on the system. VirtualBox tends to use local addressing within your system for it's virtual machines, so on the host machine you'd have to forward incoming traffic to the internal 10.0.2.15 address.\nI'm going to guess that your system/server has one IP address from the router on your home network. You can use that IP address as the destination for the website, however, you cannot get an address more \"public\" than the 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 range, as it is a \"private network\" within your system (because VirtualBox is weird that way).\nIf you have a home system that is the host of the VBox VM behind a router that has an IP address of 192.168.1.194 (for example), and you have your VM on your system with an IP address of 10.0.2.15, the way to get data from the internet to the VM is two stepped, really:\n(1) The router will need to route port 80 to 192.168.1.194 (or whatever the actual IP for your host system is, that is to say, the system running the VirtualBox VM.) \n(2) Your system will need a specific iptables (or similar firewall) rule to forward port 80 or related ports from the host system to 10.0.2.15 (the VBox VM).\n", "Q: Mounting a Windows folder with writing permissions in Ubuntu Apparently the answer is here: https://superuser.com/questions/251537/mount-specific-ntfs-directory-on-linux however it is not working as expected.\nI have a dual boot system with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.04 (upgraded from 12.10), and I want to access my Windows 7 personal folders for both reading and writing.

The mount options can be changed by a separate remount command, for example:\n\nmount --bind olddir newdir\nmount -o remount,ro newdir\n\nI also doubt that it is possible to --rbind a part of a file system with a different file system driver (ntfs vs ntfs-3g).\nWhen you rbind the mount command ignores every option, so nothing will become read-write. And because the kernel ntfs driver does not support writes, obviously the rw option won't help with that one either. Use the ntfs-3g driver. \nBasically what you should do is this (in a terminal):\nmount -t ntfs-3g -o ro /dev/sda1 /media/windows\nmount --bind /media/windows/Users/MyUser/    /home/myuser/Windows\nmount -o remount,rw /home/myuser/Windows\n\n(I think that --rbind is also unnecessary, --bind should be enough.)\nAnd regarding the comment under the question: Of course you don't have to restart the system for testing, just use the mount command as I did above. (And unmount with the umount command.)\nAfter you confirmed that this works as intended, you just modify the mount and add the options you want: uid, gid,umask, etc.\n\nA: See if this helps...\nIf sda1 is already mounted to /media/windows, you could unmount it with:\nsudo umount /media/windows\n\nNext create the directory windows in /media/: \nsudo mkdir /media/windows\n\nEdit the /etc/fstab as below:\n/dev/sda1  /media/windows ntfs-3g  rw,nodev,noexec,auto,nouser,async,locale=en_US.utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0002 0 0\n\n/media/windows/Users/MyUser/  /home/myuser/Windows  ntfs-3g rbind,user,rw,nodev,noexec,auto,async,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0002 0 0\n\n/media/windows/Users/OtherUser/  /home/otheruser/Windows  rbind,user,rw,nodev,noexec,auto,async,uid=1001,gid=1001,umask=0002 0 0\n\n(Note: change uid and gid values as for the user. To get the uid and gid of a user you can use the command id -u username and id -g username resp.)\nNow you can mount these with the command:\nsudo mount -a\n\nNow go to the rebinded directories and see if you can edit the file. And you should be done.\n\nA: Do all your testing before editing your fstab configuration file.\nWell, you probably know that ntfs filesystem is  automatically mounted in read-only if filessystem is flagged as dirty. What you have to do first before trying any of the answers is to mount disk in windows and run chkdsk before trying to mount it again.\nAlso, if mounting in rw still failing, you should try mounting with different mount type options such as sudo mount -t ntfs or sudo mount -t ntfs-3g\nOnce fs is mounted in rw you can do the following :\nmount --bind /media/MOUNTPOINT/TARGETFOLDER    /home/SHAREDDIRECTORY/\nmount -o remount,ro /home/SHAREDDIRECTORY/\nor \nsudo gksu nautilus or sudo gksu dolphin to open an explorer with su rights\n\nA: Why not trying to mount it with read and write attribute : rw   ?\n/dev/sda1 /media/windows ntfs rw,umask=0222,defaults 0 0\n\nA: I am not quite sure however, can you try this please. After the drive is mounted, give the following command on the terminal\nsudo gksu nautilus\n\nenter your administrative password and in the graphical window that open, you should be able to click the drive and change read/write permissions.\nLet me know if this works. There is help available for use of nautilus with graphical interface with root privileges.\n\nA: The above linked super user question is for mounting partition and sub directory in read only mode. You need only the sub-directory (personal folder) to  be read-write.  \nFirst check your system can mount ntfs partition in read-write mode\nmount -t ntfs-3g  -o rw /dev/sda1 /media/windows\n\nNow test if the mounted fs is writable. If not stop here and ask another question in this site. \nThe problem is an RO mounted partition's sub-directory can't be in RW. So the solution is mount the windows partition in RW in a hidden and inaccessible place. So let's mount it on /root/win which is inaccessible by non-root users  (without sudo)  \nAs a root user do following\nSteps\n1. Mount windows partition in RW  \nmount -t ntfs-3g -o rw /dev/sda1 /root/win  \n\n2. Bind it\nmount --bind /root/win/Users/MyUser/  /home/myuser/Windows  \n\n3. Bind a read only instance of windows partition  \nmount --bind /root/win /media/windows  \nmount -o remount,ro /media/windows\n\nNow everything should be OK. Additionally you can unmount the windows partition but I warn you in some system it will make make the binded one (@home) inaccessible. The code is umount /root/win \nAlternatively you can mount the windows partition in RW at /media/windows ( instead of /root/win) and immediately bind mount it at the same mount point (/media/windows)  so that no one (even root) can write on the partition (but on the user folder).\n\nA: I would recommend using sudo chmod.666 ~/Windows\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\n\nA: The easiest way to mount Windows as read-write is to simply reboot it or do a full shut down. The NTFS partition hibernates when \"fast shut down\" is used. This principle is covered in greater detail at this link.\n", "Q: How do I enable all four cores on my Toshiba P70-A notebook? (only one enabled now) I recently noticed my computer is highly sluggish (recent install of Kubuntu 13.04 by the way).

There have been many problems with almost every distro of linux on this machine, from no wireless, graphics issues etc.etc. I realized I couldn't have been the only person with this processor running linux, so I managed to find some forums regarding the same issue with this particular chipset running only one core. \nAnd it turns out if you run in acpi=off, then the kernel will only utilize one core, and on one thread. That solution worked for that particular individual, however acpi=off was the only way to actually install linux, period. nomodeset would get you to the install screen, but the try out ubuntu/kubuntu screens were... just not there, not rendering. And as this was listed as a viable option for getting rid of the black screen problem, I had done just that, without any mention that this would disable cores, wireless networks, the fan etc.\nAfter many attempts at different solutions, I had decide to do a fresh install with nomodeset anyway, despite not being able to render the desktop. Upon restarting after the installation, everything worked fine.

Windows only works for a few seconds to a few minutes before showing a blue screen and restarting. I am trying to install Ubuntu from a 4 GB USB stick, but when I do that it has an X next to \"has at least 5.3 GB available drive space\" but the computer has well over 600 GB available. I think Ubuntu thinks the USB drive is the HDD. I have been trying to install Ubuntu since this morning. I can try Ubuntu from this computer and that works fine. When I first turn on the computer and press F12 it doesn't show the USB drive as something I can boot from. Then Windows boots and when it restarts due to an error it boots Ubuntu. Does anyone have any idea of how I could fix this and get it to install on the computer?\n\nA: First things first here. If the machine keeps re-booting, then there is either a problem with the hardware or a driver that is loading when Windows boots. If you have recovery media for Windows, suggest you try to boot with that first to determine what may be happening. If the hardware is somehow in a bad way, no amount of \"just reinstall or install something else\" will resolve the issue. \nDoes your BIOS have the option to make sounds when it fails on POST? If so, and that is turned off, enable that option and restart the machine. The POST (power-on self test) errors are there to make noise for a reason. They let you know if hardware is failing, but many manufacturers turn it off to prevent end-user complaint.\nHave you tried grabbing the GParted bootable ISO and loading that? At least you might see how the machine sees your hardware. Would also suggest trying the Ultimate Boot CD as a way to boot into your hardware and run diagnostic tests. There are a number of utilities that can provide assistance.\nOnce you have run the tests, you will hopefully have an answer as to the root cause of the failure. Sometimes, a bad driver can cause this (from a recent install) or failing memory or a hard disk failure. Once you determine the issue that way, you can properly take action to recover your system.\n", "Q: Set up permissions for a secondary user I have a user that I want to give read and write access to a folder in my root home (/root/test)\nIs there a way to give them permission to only modify files in /root/test, but not /root itself?\nAlso, this is kind of a side question, but how can I prevent this user from being able to view or edit the files in /var/www?

But, apt-get doesn't know any of this, so you should change your url to login these ppa's:\nsudo add-apt-repositories https://username:password@private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/intellij-idea-ce/ubuntu/\n\nor adding manually the lines to your sources.list:\ndeb https://private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/intellij-idea-ce/ubuntu/ raring/main amd64\n\nIf you need help about what url you should write, consult your suscription page in LaunchPad\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 12.04 bootloader issues I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 over Windows 7 using a USB drive. However, I am not able to install it. Installation breaks saying that \"bootloader cannot be installed on \nthis device.\" In the details section, I see the ubiquity message saying that it can't read the partition from dev/sda. I've tried various things, boot-repair one among them (http://paste.ubuntu.com/6056191/), but no luck. What am I exactly doing wrong?\n\nA: I was able to install it by disabling RAID.\n\nA: Did you start with clean disks with no partition table on it or did you reuse the disks. This can be the reason why your system won't boot. Guess how I know.\nFirst clean your disks with:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/yourdev bs=512 count=1\n\nreplace yourdev with the device name of your disks\nThen install Ubuntu again. It will then install new gpt partition tables. You only need a swap and a boot partition in raid ofcourse.\nDon't forget to adjust your uefi settings in the bios.\n", "Q: Netinstall PXE for Ubuntu 13.04 keeps rebooting When I try to perform a netinstall with the 13.04 kernel/initrd the PC keeps rebooting without installing anything.\nThe PC starts with PXE, downloads kernel from TFTP, downloads the initrd and immediately after reboots, without any error message or any pause time.\nI can't even find any way to debug my configuration, because it restarts immediately without any feedback.\nAny suggestion?\nAnybody got this netinstall working?\n\nA: Turns out that the pxelinux.0 i was using was largely outdated, and couldn't boot properly.\nFortunately Ubuntu ships a good pxelinux.0 kernel at the address http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/\nand those should be used to load the PXE system.\nIn addition I had problems with the configuration, but in that folder the Ubuntu team placed the whole configuration to boot the system, so I just copyied it and it started.\n", "Q: latest ubuntu on dell xps 12 I am planning on buying a dell xps 12 at the end of the week so i can replace my laptop and my tablet and have both all in one device. I am very attracted to this concept, however I love ubuntu as opposed to windows. This will be a huge selling point as to whether i do purchase the computer or not. I have researched this and keep getting mixed answers on the subject so I figured I would go straight to the source ans as Ubuntu themselves. Is there any way to put the latest ubuntu onto the dell xps 12 and still have full functionality on it in both laptop mode and tablet mode?\n\nA: I bought XPS12 couple weeks ago specifically with Ubuntu in mind. I tried couple versions from 12.04 to 13.04 both 32 and 64 bit. Most of things work out of the box. I didn't have any issues with sound, network or bluetooth etc. Even touchscreen works. There are some limitations though. Plain Ubuntu supports touch but not multitouch (I don't use that anyway so for me it's unimportant). For 12.10 there is a project Sputnik. It's some Italian guys that have repo of updates for 12.10 that makes multitouch work, and some other improvements for touchpad and function keys. This does not work on 13.04 last time I tried. Also there is a little annoying bit on 13.04 that it boots up with screen brightness to 0, so looks like broken graphics driver, but Fn+F5 to bring brightness up corrects that. One thing that I can't get running at all is the accelerometer, so screen won't flip or rotate on it's own. You have to switch that yourself, or make a script that does that and assign it to some button for easy operation.\nOverall I like my little Ubuntu XPS. I'm using it also for games from Steam.\nI'm looking forward to 13.10 to see how touch works with MIR, and if there are any improvements for me.\n\nA: I got the touchpad working perfectly fine including multitouch on Ubuntu 14.04 by using touchegg, which I got working with the manual by domester answer on this threat:\nHow can I disable arbitrary default multitouch gestures in Unity?\nI couldnt figure out how to define multitouch gestures for the touchscreen though. In my case it uses exactly the same gestures as the touchpad which makes it usable but not very intuitive.\nSo yes, latest Ubuntu (14.04) works good on the XPS 12 but not perfect, still good enough for me to not even think about getting back to win8.1.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 installation fail on ASUS S551LB (Hybrid Graphics) I've just purchased a new ASUS S551LB. It comes with an i7 4500U and NVidia Geforce 740M, with the NVidia Optimus feature (hybrid graphics). The full specification can be found at ASUS VivoBook S551LB\nI am trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 and failing badly. During the installation it seems fine, until it we restart the laptop and try to boot it for the first time. The error message says:\n 8.679154] nouveau E[  DEVICE][0000:04:00.0] unknown chipset, 0x108120a1\n 8.679179] nouveau E[     DRM] failed to create 0x80000080, -22\n15.030164] mei 0000:00:16.0: init hw failure.\n15.030230] mei 0000:00:16.0: initialization failed.\n\nAfter I force shutdown the laptop and boot it for the second time, I do not see the message again - but just a blank screen. I'm quite lost in the dark on where to start debugging. I've done hairpulling lots of google-ing without finding any result. Any help on how I can successfully install Ubuntu 13.04 is very much appreciated.\nThank you everyone.\n\nA: Try blacklisting the mei module, that one is known to cause (re)boot failures. (Likely you won't need that one anyway.)\nAdd the following line to the end of your /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file:\nblacklist mei\n\nOr if you can't get to the system, then blacklist it on boot by adding the kernel parameter\nmodprobe.blacklist=mei\n\nat GRUB. (If you don't know how to add kernel parameters at boot, read this answer)\nAlso you may try updating your BIOS.\n"]
