["Q: mdadm trying to resync/rebuild array automatically Previously I had setup a ubuntu server using mdadm with 4x 2TB drives. One of my drives died and since this was my backups of my data on different servers I didn't care about losing it.\nSince then, I've purchased a replacement drive and some new server hardware. I completely reinstalled ubuntu on my SSD, then I deleted the partition table and volumes on all 4 of the 2TB drives. Then I went to create a brand new array but when I do, it immediately says degraded and it is trying to resync my new drive with the old array I had setup.\nHow do I just get it to create a new array so I can format the entire array and create a new empty volume?\nNote: I was doing this in the Ubuntu desktop in the unity GUI with the disk utility.\nSince then I've changed over to a full headless server install, but I still want to create this array so it doesn't try to resync the replacement disk.\n\nA: You have dissembled/stopped the old array and created a new one with mdadm, right? In that case the superblocks of the old array on all drives should have been overwritten, the old array is no more. But, now you are wondering why you see something like following in /proc/mdstat, right?\nPersonalities : [raid6] [raid5] [raid4]\nmd0 : active raid5 loop6[6] loop5[4] loop4[3] loop3[2] loop2[1] loop1[0]\n      511680 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [6/5] [UUUUU_]\n      [>....................]  recovery =  2.0% (2176/102336) finish=0.7min speed=2176K/sec\n\nunused devices: <none>\n\nThis is just fine for initial array creation.\n", "Q: Webcam not working and detected in 12.04, but on 11.10 was working I had been using Ubuntu 11.10 with all the bells and whistles, every thing fine. I download and install the newest version of Ubuntu (12.04) and the webcam doesn't work. I tried installing cheese, but this application reports that it does not find any devices.\nThen I found a similar question here, but installing the application gave me the same error:\n\nGuvcview error:\n  Unable to open device\n  Please make sure the camera is connected\n  and that the correct driver is installed.\n\nI have an HP G60 with integrated webcam that worked perfectly under 11.10. What should I do?\nThx!/Francisco\n\nA: Procedure to install web cam in UBUNTU 12.04 LTS OS \nFirst download the libwebcam0 files from Ubuntu one.\nthen, enter the command : $ echo guvcview\nIt will ask your root pass word: ***\nGive your pass word ,then it will unwrap required files itself.\nbefore that it ask the consumption of disk space ,Give Yes\nAfter completion of this step \ngive : guvcview libwebcam0 \nyour web cam will activate. \n\nA: I also had this problem with a webcam someone gave to me yesterday. It is USB device, a Genius iLook 320. Naturally there are windows and mac drivers, but nothing official about using it with Ubuntu.\nTherefore, RTFM for guvcview. Open a terminal, and type\nman guvcview\nIt says, among other things:\n\"-d, --device=VIDEO_DEVICE    Video Device [default: /dev/video0]\"\nMake sure your webcam is attached. Then go to the terminal and enter the command:\nls /dev | grep -i video\nThe reply is:\nvideo1\nAha! The default device that guvcview uses, video0, DOES NOT EXIST!\nTherefore, you must make guvcview use the device that exists, because that's where your webcam is.\nat the terminal:\nguvcview --device=video1 &\nand it should work. If you run guvcview from the menu, edit the menu item, adding \"--device=video1\"  The \"&\" is for running from the terminal. There are other command line options given in the man page, and I have not tried to figure out what they do yet.\nWhen you run guvcview from the terminal, you will see a lot of messages about \"ALSA lib\"  which is for sound (which my camera does not have), and other messages such as:\n\"{ pixelformat = 'RGB3', description = 'RGB3' }\"\nThese messages might help you configure video quality.\nThe first time you run it, it will create a configuration file in your home directory:  ~/.guvcviewrc-video1\nYou can edit this file as desired. The default picture quality of my device leaves a lot to be desired. YMMV.\n\nA: Similar experience, figured out a temporary workaround. You can find it posted here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1253907&highlight=hp+dv9000+webcam\nThe post's toward the end, it doesn't work 100% but if your problem is the same as mine it should help a bit.\n\nA: Use guvcview and select video type as YV12. It will solve the problem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 strange internal battery capacity error I recently bought a MSI-X370 laptop with ATI graphics and wiped Windows and replaced with Ubuntu 12.04.\nNow, up until my upgrade from beta 2 to the first stable Ubuntu 12.04 release, I didn't have problems with this.  \nThis is the problem:\nACPI knows that my battery capacity is 4400mAh, but only randomly charges fully ever.  Otherwise, it charges to around 86%, and I get a orange light blinking on the laptop, and my acpi -V says that I'm charged to 100%.  The strange thing is, that I do a cat info again, and it is still not charged to capacity.  Why the discrepancy?  Did something change in acpi, upower, gnome-power-manager? I am lost, and no one seems to want to assist.\ncat info:\n/proc/acpi/battery/BAT1$ cat ./info\npresent:                 yes\ndesign capacity:         4300 mAh\nlast full capacity:      4053 mAh\nbattery technology:      rechargeable\ndesign voltage:          14800 mV\ndesign capacity warning: 0 mAh\ndesign capacity low:     0 mAh\ncycle count:          0\ncapacity granularity 1:  1 mAh\ncapacity granularity 2:  1 mAh\nmodel number:            ?MODEL\nserial number:           \nbattery type:            LION\nOEM info:                ?CUSTOMER\nI am standing by for anyone's ideas\nThanks\n\nA: Batteries lose capacity as they age.  Even if they are not used, ie they are sitting on the shelf in a warehouse.\nIf the capacity you are seeing is about 85% of the design capacity I'd say that is not too bad for a battery with a year or so under its belt (though normally on a brand new battery you'd expect that to be a good amount higher).\nEdit: given that this particular battery is brand new, and that the capacity seems to be dropping too fast, there may be a fault with the battery.\nIt is possible for a battery capacity to be, say 4400mAh by design, but to actually be 4480mAh when brand new, then drop to 3950mAh within the first year and a half.  At any time, however, if you charge the battery fully to that amount, it should be reported as 100% charged (or 98%+, depending on the aggressivity of the charger), even if the capacity of the battery is only 89% that of the battery's design capacity.  This is because the percentage charged should be reported as a percentage of actual capacity rather than design capacity.\nAt any rate, it isn't an Ubuntu issue.  I mean, how much the charger charges the battery, when it stops charging, and how much the battery is capable of storing, isn't.  How it's reported in Ubuntu might be, however.  If you have reason to suspect that Ubuntu is actually reporting the battery capacity incorrectly, notwithstanding what I said above, then that is entirely possible.\nNote too that all those stats the battery keeps are a best guess, and they are somewhat limited in their ability to accurately measure the amount of charge going in and out.\nThis answer may not have actually solved your problem buy hopefully it was still somewhat useful.\n\nA: Flashing orange indicates there is a problem with the battery, http://forum-en.msi.com/faq/article/battery-led-is-blinking-orange \nBlinking orange is battery failure, http://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?topic=125647.0\nIt may still be under warranty since is has been only 2 months, contact MSI about a replacement. If it is not covered by warranty you should buy a new battery.\n\nA: I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this discussion, as it led me to a couple of ideas that I used when testing the charging method for this laptop.  I am marking this solved only because I was able to get the battery to charge to 100% again... HOWEVER, I was unable to get the the root of the problem, and I doubt that this fix will work on other laptops.  What I discovered regarding the trickle charge (thanks mateo and neon_overload) was that the energy provided during the time that the computer was on was ineffective in charging the battery, presumably because too much power was being provided to the system.  When the battery is above 90% charge, there seems to be a safety mechanism built in that keeps the battery from charging too much, and it was being activated any time I tried to charge the laptop from above the measured 90%.  To fix this, I drained the battery to 80% (of the measured capacity, not design capacity), and pulled the battery while the system was on.  I then powered the system down and plugged the battery back in.  This made the system avoid trickle charging and also avoid the safety mechanism that is built in.  20 minutes later the orange flashing light that I had been seeing disappeared, and the white charging light turned off, indicating that the battery had charged fully.\nThanks again for all of your help guys, it's much appreciated.\nlinux_RRT\n", "Q: How can I fix broken i915 drivers for Intel GPUs? I've got troubles getting the i915 drivers to work correctly on my laptop (HP Pavilion DM4 2101ea). \nSpecifically, the laptop screen goes black and stays black after the splash graphic when booting both from USB key and from harddrive. \nTo get anything on to the display after the splash screen I have to boot either with\n\n\n*\n\n*acpi=off\n\n*nomodeset\n\n*i915.modeset=0\nI'd rather not turn ACPI off because I like my fans spinning and nomodeset is a bit overkill, so for now I'm booting with i915.modeset=0.\nUnfortunately, this turns off KMS and my current maximum resolution on the laptop screen is fixed to 1024x768 instead of its real capability.\nWhen not setting any of the above boot flags and I plug in an external monitor, the external monitor works fine.

I also have a more in-depth explanation of what happens to cause blank / black screens written up there, if you really want to know what's going on.\n\nA: Im working through similar issues with my x230, but more focussed on getting external screens running.  I had to use the nomodeset flag to get installed.  Here is what I have so far:\ndisplay port on x230 not working\nmy steps so far to get closer to working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dont use nomodeset or modeset=0, as it throws off KMS and you wont be able to do anything.\n\n*sudo vi /etc/initramfs-tools/modules  and add in the i915 and intel_agp drivers, save, and rebuild by running update-initramfs -u\nIve also made a custom x config stub in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ to load the intel driver and give it some specifications, and a monitor config for all my devices.  However, I still cant get my second monitor running!\nAlso - Ive used arandr to create a shell script that sets all my resolutions nicely, except it too wont cause my displayport-connected monitor to function...\nHope that helps,\n\nA: For me this was a backlight issue. See the article for toubleshooting and reporting instructions.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Debugging/Backlight\n\nA: Be careful setting i915.modeset=0.\nAll versions since 2.15 of the Intel-driver only support KMS. If you've deactivated KMS e.g. by adding the option i915.modeset=0 to the file /etc/default/grub, please reactivate KMS by deleting this option.\nSource: https://launchpad.net/~glasen/+archive/intel-driver\n\nA: In /etc/rc.local, just before exit 0, put a line setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=30.\nThis will turn on the backlight, to brightness 30 (where 00 is full bright and FF is full dark).  The boot process will be dark but the light will come on immediately after the login screen appears.\nnomodeset is not used with this method, so the native screen resolution is available.  I like the results, but still can't adjust my screen brightness with the Fn key.\nBTW I got this from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1744809.

The program downgraded one package and installed a number of new packages. Eventually, I was prompted to reboot. I opened the site that normally causes my screen to go blank in google chrome. Since I observed no more crashes I take it the problem is resolved.\nNote that I have no more command line options added to grub. Also note that I run kernel 3.13.0-44 and Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: i have a gateway nv78 with the black screen after the splash from the infamous intel mobile 4 chipset - actually it is the backlight - it is backwards? idek\nexternal monitors work ok so you may need to use one to do this\nanyway, boot the computer, and as root, edit the file /etc/rc.local\n just before the exit 0 line, add the line\n setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=00\nsave it\ntake out all the other things you've tried lol - be sure to run update-grub if you remove stuff from the grub quiet slpash part\nreboot - the screen will go blank for a few seconds at boot like it used to do, but then about the time the mouse pointer arrow thing shows up the screen light will suddenly come back on and all is well\nthis works better than nomodeset as it gives you all the display modes and not just vesa 1280*720 - it now will detect plugged in monitors too and everything will work correctly\n\nA: I ran into this problem on my Dell Inspiron 3000. (The little 11' sub-$200 one, thanks Dell for reusing model numbers -_-)\nUsing 'nomodeset' did allow me to boot, but it had no GL acceleration and it was almost unbearable to use. On a whim, I changed a setting in the bios about legacy boot ROM (or something similar, I can't get the exact name without rebooting). After that was disabled, I was able to boot without issues. No black screen, and no need for 'nomodeset' that ruined the GL acceleration.

This card obviously isn't very well supported by the manufacturer in Ubuntu, so for anyone coming across this, I would suggest you go with an external KVM solution that isn't tied to your specific server hardware.\n\nA: You should check in the BIOS on the server to make sure onboard audio is enabled. The Teradici card presents itself as an audio device which may trigger the BIOS to disable the onboard audio. You should be able to override this.\n\nA: As something to try:\nUnless the onboard hardware uses the same driver \"snd_hda_intel\" driver you could try editing the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file and adding:\nblacklist snd_hda_intel\nIn order to stop the driver from starting and grabbing the KVM board.\nAnother more selective approach might be ignoring the device with a udev rule matching the unwanted device and specifying OPTIONS+=\"ignore_device\" For more information on writing the rule see this.\n", "Q: Is one node + MAAS possible?

I'm trying to do some debugging in Android and I am running a live logcat in the Terminal, but the problem is that there is too much information generated so that when I am finished and try to copy all the information received by choosing \"Select All\" and then \"Copy\" a lot of the early output which is produced isn't copied. I was aware of history, but that just provides a list of commands that have previously been entered, not the output.\nCan I see a history of all the output that the terminal gives, or perhaps can I have the terminal save as a text file all the output that it is producing?\n\nA: You can append all logs to a text file by redirecting output. But this requires each command is executed like this (this will catch both stdout & stderr)\ncommand >>file.txt 2>&1\n\nOR\nYou can record screencasts of terminal, since it stores screencast in text file, you can use that.

At work we have a Canon C5045i printer, for which Canon provides three PPD files: ps, pcl, and pxl.\nIs there any one that is preferable over the others?\nIs there any difference between the three?\n\nA: PostScript and PCL are the most commenly used Page Description Languages, that means the low level language that printers understand.\nPCL comes in different versions (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_Command_Language), PXL being PCL-XL or PCL6 (Enhanced) being the latest and greatest version.\nMost printers only support either PostScript or PCL (a specific or several versions of it).\nAccording to it's specifications it looks like your printer model seems to supports both PostScript and PCL6 and 5c.\nGenerally you should use the PostScript driver if your printer supports it since this will give maximum output quality. The PXL or PCL6 driver can be used as alternative to PostScript if the printer has problems in PostScript mode, like interpreter bugs or low memory. The PCL(5c) driver will probably give you no extra benefit (perhaps the PXL is only b/w and PCL is for color, depends on the info inside the PPDS and how well your printer supports PCL6).\nThe \"best\" driver really depends upon what you expect of it: speed or maximum output quality and also depends on the input that is used (b/w or color and text/line art or photo). It could be that the PXL is faster for just text in b/w while the PostScript gives better output quality for photo in color, just do a small test to find out or use them both for different purposes.\n\nA: I have the same type of Canon C5045i, and the PCL6-PCL5e-PostScript-UFRII_v21.30_INF_x64-UFRII_v21.30_Setup_x64 installer v21.30 does not work for me.\nWhen I tried the Canon Generic PCL6 Printer Driver (v2.00), the printer worked fine but printed in black only.\nAfter that I found the UFRII_XPS_V200_Win_uk_EN_02 (an XPS Driver) v.600 and it works fine, now I can print in color.\n\nA: I recommend to use the official Drivers for Canon imageRUNNER ADVANCE C5045i. There are three different versions available:\n\n*\n\n*CQue DEB (This installs the driver)\n\n*CQue TGZ (if you want to select the driver manually)\n\n*UFR II/UFRII LT Printer Driver for Linux V5.50 (no not use this one, it's buggy for PDFs)\n\nI have the Canon ir adv C3830i, which is similar.\n\n*\n\n*UFR leads for several PDFs to freezing of the printer, do not use it\n\n*CQue offerst three different PPD: PCL,PS,PXL\n\n*\n\n*PCL might be the best option\n\n*PS did in my case only print in grayscale, however this provides the highest quality\n\n*PXL did only print in black for Rashad Al Megrab, for me it worked flawlessly\n\n\n\n", "Q: Uploading an HTML5 app to the Software Center I have an app written in HTML and JavaScript, suitable for distribution in the Chrome Web Store as a packaged app. (You can even package it up as a single HTML file with data: URIs.)\nIs it possible for me to submit an app like this to the Ubuntu Software Center?

When installing Wine on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04, both 64-bit support and 32-bit support get installed. If I run wine foo.exe where foo.exe is a 64-bit-aware installer, it thinks it's on 64-bit Windows. This would be fine if this mode didn't fail, but in my case, it does (yet the Wine database suggests the app I'm trying to install should work, presumably as a 32-bit app).\nHow do I tell Wine (and Winetricks) to use Wine in 32-bit-only mode?\n\nA: You can in an easy way copy all win32 files into .wine to substitute the lesser need to change all run commands as well. By avoiding doing to much changes to the system in another hand. At first, run the command:\nWINEPREFIX=\"$HOME/prefix32\" WINEARCH=win32 wine wineboot\n\nAssume you already made a run of making .wine with 64bit compatibility. If not you are still able to make a folder called .wine instead in your home directory.\nThen copy all content of prefix32 found in your home directory to your .wine content area both files and directories, first either backup or just remove the content in the directory .wine if you already are planning running 32bit arch of wine, don't overwrite content! Rather delete if you already made a backup.\nRemember that directory .wine might be hidden, any use of seeing hidden files will make you be able to see the folder in your home directory. You can as well use the Go in Thunar with Ubuntu to either just go straight into the folder called .wine in the home directory and make the process as told here before.\n\nA: Install playonlinux there you will have this option. It is a frontend to wine, and makes it far better.\nThis picture was taken on a 12.04 - 64bit system.\n\nA: You can run 32-bit Windows programmes on a 64-bit Linux machine with wine by installing playonlinux. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't done so before, install playonlinux: sudo apt install playonlinux. \n\n*Start the playonlinux GUI: playonlinux &. \n\n*Click \"Install a program\" in the left sidebar. \n\n*Click \"Install a non-listed program\". \n\n*If this is the first time you started playonlinux, you might have to click through two notification windows. \n\n*Click \"Next\", then select \"Install a program in a new virtual drive\"\n\n*Choose a name for your new virtual drive, preferably the name of the Windows program you want to install. \n\n*Leave all checkboxes unchecked on the next screen and click \"Next\". \n\n*Select \"32 bits windows installation\" and click \"Next\". \n\n*Click \"Browse\" to select the installation file of the program you want to install and follow the instructions of the installer. \n\n\nA: It turns out that to make Wine run in 32-bit-only mode, one needs to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove ~/.wine if it was already created in the 64-bit mode. (WARNING: This removes all stuff you have installed under Wine. Move it aside instead if you want to avoid dataloss.)\n\n*Set the WINEARCH environment variable to win32 i.e. export WINEARCH=win32\n\n*Then run wine (or winetricks, etc.)\n\nA: Install Play on linux as said before , i did it in like 1 minute , What you need to have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is have a 32 bit wine version , like said before. \n\n*Next you need to press install\n\n*Click the text at the bottom that says something like install a program that is not listed\n\n*Check change wine version\n\n*Select the 32 bit version you have installed\n\n*Create a new virtual disk\n\n*Name it\n\n*AND THE MOS IMPORTANT:Select 32 bit virtual disk\n\n*Select the installer and install\n\n\nA: Try to remove .wine and export a wine prefix:\n$rm -r .wine\n$export WINEARCH=''win32''\n$export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine\n\n$wine config\n\n\nA: While you can not run within the same containers you can actually still have both by setting up Biarch.

Since the computer froze I tried to reboot and constantly got the message: mountall: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /lib/libpllibply.so.2  \nI ended up reinstalling 12.04 with a USB, re-adjusting the size of the partition and now it works fine. The problem is that the new upgrade has left without ANY of my documents and there were some hugely important ones, is there anyway to recover them? I cannot enter any of the previous lynux versions available on my laptop, any tips?\n\nA: Oh gosh... I'm sooo sorry!\nFirst off, you need to know that you are not the only one! It happens to all of us. When this happens to me, I tell myself that learning is NOT free.\nThis upgrading feature should be disabled. I had a lot of problems with it too.\nFirst off, you need to know how many partitions you already have on your computer. I guess you only have one hard drive right?\nGo to your terminal and type : sudo fdisk -l\nPlease post here all your partitions that you have on your hard drive such as /dev/sda1, 2, 3 etc.. with the type 83, I guess you only have one partition?\nYou might be able to recover 'some' files...

Here it is: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download\nAnother good one is http://www.r-tt.com/free_linux_recovery/Download.shtml\nRemember that you will probably end up recovering your files bit by bit so there will be corruption in some while others will simply not be recoverable.\nI know it's very frustrating. It happened to all of us. I guess that's the way we learn. \nAlways make a backup!\nGo to your ubuntu software center and type 'backup'. Install a backup software and start using it. \nAll of us have too much stuff to back up so we postpone to backup. My best suggestion is that you need to group what is important and what is not in your documents. Start by only backing up what is important to you... On a daily basis (or at the very least weekly).  Keep a backup off site also. That way, if you get stolen, you will still have your offsite backup you'll be able to recover from.\nTrust me, this happened to me too.\nStepNjump.\n\nA: \nand there were some hugely important ones\n\nIn case these data reside on a partition that was repartitioned and partly overwritten by a fresh installation, and if they are really that important with no backup at hand:\nStop using the disk!\nOnly then you make sure that the remainders of your data are not overwritten more and more. The less was written in addition on that disk the more chance you have to recover some of your files by data recovery tools such as Testdisk/Photorec (testdisk ).\nTestdisk should be installed and run from booting with a live CD. Have another drive at hand where you can store the recovered files.\nSee also: Is there a way to recover files from a storage device partially overwritten with dd?.\n", "Q: Getting all the temporary Internet files after clear history I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 and Google chrome as a browser. I have made Google chrome as my default browser. \nSuppose I have cleared my browsing history in Google chrome and still I want to get all those files that I have visited on the Internet, so is it possible to get all the files after clearing the history clear? \n\nA: You need undelete software to do this but if you touched your browser and it created new files you can probably forget about it.

When I open up \"Sound Settings\" and open the \"Applications\"-tab the program outputting the sound flashes up in approximately the same frequency the sound is chopped, then disappearing again and the message \"No audio-application is recording or playing anything.\" (These translations might not be 100% correct since I'm using the german Ubuntu.)

But I could not exactly figure out what should I do.\n\nA: The problem is that you are executing the command inside /usr/src to which you do not have write permissions with your credentials. Therefore you do not have write permissions for the .tar file you are trying to create. Use tar cvf /tmp/rtl_archive.tar /usr/src to create a tar-file where writing is possible.\nGenerally you can give any path that you have write access to, such as:\ntar cvf $HOME/rtl_archive.tar /usr/src\n\nto create the .tar file in.\n", "Q: Expert help needed due to an insidious trap when triple booting OS/W7/Ubuntu... which I fell into This was going to be my first Ubuntu install, aiming to triple boot from a Mac Book Air OS, W7 and Ubuntu. I used USB sticks for both the W7 and Ubuntu. After successfully partitioning using OS (it is apparently required to do it from OS because of the MBR/GPT issues) installing W7 and refit, and having a working dual boot, I proceeded with Ubuntu, following this tutorial.\nI however missed the advanced button that would have allowed to specify that the boot loader should be installed in a non standard way, to the same partition into which Linux is being installed.\nI restarted with no USB drive connected, expecting to see the refit menu with the three OSs, but there had been no change: only OS and W7 were selectable. That's when I noticed something was wrong. So I reconnected the USB drive with the Ubuntu installer and restarted with the intention of reinstalling. To my surprise I could now select Ubuntu from the hard drive, in which case it would boot correctly, or the USB installer, which instead of running normally showed a menu to select the OS to boot.\nAnd now is when I made the big mistake: I destroyed the partition from OS and/or w7 thinking that would allow me to reinstall. Now whenever I connect the USB and select it in the refit menu a command prompt that says \"error: no such device: 56756fb3-57a2-4f0c-8068-a9068cb88a18.\", and in a new line: \"grub rescue> \". I tried to find the Ubuntu file system with fs but none of the listed partitions that appear with the \"ls\" command were recognized. This does make sense since Ubuntu's file system was presumably destroyed with my hard formatting and destruction of the partition in which I had installed it. I have recreated a partition to no avail.\nObviously somewhere is stored that Linux was once installed, and I need to reset that in order to reinstall. My guess is I need to fix the MBR or the GPT, but I don't know how to accomplish such a feat or even if that is what I need to do.\nI know this is very specific, but I believe might happen to other potential triple booters. Is there anyone who could please help me? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Wow, what a mess. Personally I would just start over. Install OS, then Win 7, then Ubuntu again, and if Ubuntu doesn't show up in your boot options again, edit Grub instead of messing with the partitions. \n", "Q: Copy and execute file via rdesktop I successfully conntected to a windows machine in LAN via grdesktop.

In this case your password, not the root password will ba asked.\nTry (in a terminal):\nsudo su -\n\nand give your own password.\nIf none of that works, boot into Ubuntu using a rescue CD (or USB key)\n\n\n*\n\n*On the boot prompt choose \"Advanced options\" and/or \"Rescue a broken system\"\n\n*Answer the prompts about language and keyboard settings, hostname and network (if needed)\n\n*Wait for the system to give you the rescue options\n\n*Choose the root device of your system to rescue, or assemble the RAID and then choose\n\n*Assuming the device was /dev/sda1 choose the menu item \"Execute a shell in /dev/sda1\"\n\n\nFrom there execute:\npasswd <you-username>\npasswd root\n\nto reset passwords. Since the rescue shell runs as superuser, this won't ask the old password and simply set a new one. You should be done. This whole principle also works in general for many unixoid systems, not just Ubuntu or Linux in general.\n\nSide-note concerning sudo. In /etc/sudoers you have the following line:\n%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nby default. If you change that into:\n%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nall members of the group sudo will be able to execute anything as anybody else without being asked a password. This may or may not be desirable depending on the system. Also sudoers allows for much more fine-grained control over what users or groups can execute and as who. It's my favorite method of allowing limited privileged operations to unprivileged users instead of setuid :)\n", "Q: Flash choppy fullscreen ver 12.04 Tried suggested fixes, including flash aid, but still 4od streamed video is choppy full screen.\nThis site slows up browser and plays slow video? is it the site? even typing this has slowed as the page tries to load in another tab?\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/come-dine-with-me/4od\n\nA: I had the same problem with choppy audio and video.

When I do the upgrade, after install the screen on my laptop is just black and I see nothing. I've tried to upgrade several times and each time I have to uninstall and reinstall 10.10 and decline the upgrade. I would like to upgrade but until this issue is resolved I can't. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I think there is an error in that you should not really be offered the online upgrade as I believe that you can only upgrade in this way from the previous version (11.10) or the previous LTS version (10.04).\nYou will have to do  fresh installation of 12.04 but if you have a separate partition for /home your data and configuration will be retained. I assume from your recent multiple reinstallations that that is the case and that you are familiar with the partitioning bit (ie making sure you don't wipe out the /home data!) but if not come back.\nYou will need to bear in mind also that since 10.10 (3 versions ago) the ubuntu desktop environment has dramatically changed and there must be a risk that you can experience issues due to configuration conflicts. I therefore strongly recommend that you backup all your data before you begin as you cannot rule out the possibility of having to start from scratch and restoring your data from the backup medium. \nHope this helps\nIan\n", "Q: When using `byobu` in a PuTTY session cannot create new windows I have an Ubuntu 10.04.4 web server, and I have set it to run byobu on session startup.\nTo start with it all seems to work fine, for example F9 brings up the menu and F7 starts the copy/paste process.\nWhen I connect to the server using PuTTY from my PC, the problem is that when I press F2 to create a new window, the screen just flashes, and no window is created.\nI have tried setting PuTTY to use Xterm R6 in the function keys settings, as per the man page and mailing list, but have also tried using the default ESC[n~.\n\nA: In Putty, You need to set the configurations:\n-->Connection-->SSH-->Auth-->load ppk file\n\nReplace the xterm with putty-256color\n\nConnection->Data->Terminal-Type-String-> putty-256color\n\n\n\nNote: Go to session-> click save button to save the configuration.\n\n\nA: Since you are using 10.04 I'll assume you are still using the screen backend to byobu.

Those four 2TB drives I'm going to be configuring in an mdadm RAID5 array once I have Ubuntu installed on the SSD. Why is GRUB trying to install to /dev/sda and not /dev/sde?\n\nA: The OP solved the problem and gave the solution in a comment:\n\nResolved. I was unaware you could choose \"no\" to not install the grub\n  bootloader on the default screen. It then takes you to a screen that\n  lets you choose which device to install it too.

It would be nice if they would make it more clear what answering no to the GRUB install means. \nI alternatively you can just let the install finish, and then boot from install disk, followed by selecting rescue a broken system. follow the prompts and eventually you can get to a menu that will allow you to re-install GRUB, and specify which device to use.\n", "Q: logkeys not working in 12.04 After installing logkeys from synaptic, it does not work, hangs when trying to start, even the output file is not created.

Firefox works on some files, for instance.  okular has plugins for a lot of files -- you might try that if you haven't. \nIf you interested are interested in doing more than viewing, you might want to look into converters, so that another tool can do the job.  (So a standard XML tool would work.)\nOn a slightly more picky note, I see that https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6199504/convert-an-xmi-file-to-xml-file-using-python indicates that it is preferable to call an XMI to XML conversion an XML \"transformation\", since XMI is (a type of) XML. \nxmlcopyeditor and conglomerate are two XML editors in the repositories (and software center), which you might try if you haven't. \n", "Q: How to install TeamViewer?

After about 5 or 6 hours of wrangling, I found that I needed to reconfigure network settings in recovery mode and whitelist every program using the tray.

I decided to ditch it and install Ubuntu 12.04 (using \"software RAID\"). So first I reset both disks to non-RAID and then launched the Ubuntu installation. When it finished and the computer rebooted, the BIOS froze with this message on the screen:\nSerial ATA AHCI Bios, Version iSRC 1.20E\nCopyright (c) 2003-2008 Intel Corporation                      23\n** This version supports only HardDisks & CDROM drives **\nPlease wait. This will take a few seconds.\n\nController Bus#00, Device #1F, Function #02: 06 Ports, 02 Devices\n\nI have the Gigabyte GA-EP45-DS4 motherboard with the latest BIOS (F10b). However, I learned there is probably a bug in the SATA BIOS which causes the hang when the previous OS was installed in IDE mode but is now accessed in AHCI mode (see for example this link).\nSo I completely wiped both disks (by running this command from GParted Live CD: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M, although I am not sure if it is enough), then ran the Ubuntu installation again. Unfortunately the problem persists. I am not experienced enough to edit the partition table manually (as this post suggests). Is there any other way to work around this issue? \nNote: My BIOS offers three modes: IDE, AHCI and RAID (XHD). The latter one causes the same problem as AHCI.\nI am not sure if there is something I can do about it when installing Ubuntu, or whether it is rather a OS-independent hardware issue?\nSome new info: I deleted the MBR of both disks using GParted Live CD (in which, ironically, I can't run the GParted utility because of some error). Then I rebooted and the AHCI BIOS successfully detected both disks. Then I ran the Ubuntu installation (and created a software RAID, although I am not sure if it is relevant here). After the installation finished, I rebooted again and the AHCI BIOS froze when detecting the disks. So it seems there is something in the MBR the BIOS can't cope with.\nI am using the Ubuntu Alternate CD and to make things even worse, when I try the regular CD, it won't even boot - it freezes :-(\n\nA: After a few days of trying, I finally managed to sort out the issue. It turns out it was indeed a bug in the AHCI BIOS described in this discussion. So I booted using the Parted Magic CD and I mounted a USB stick with a copy of wxHex Editor. Ran the editor and manually changed the two bytes (0x1C3 and 0x1C4) of the MBR on both disks to the values the above link suggests (0xFE and 0xFF). Rebooted and voilà, both disks were successfully recognized!\n", "Q: Broken Fonts problem with Ubuntu 11.10 Upgraded from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04.\nWith 11.10, I had broken fonts.

Cannot find the answer elsewhere,\nI'm asking for a documentation of the process to create a new template for quickly. I'm interested in writing a pyside (python + qt4) template like the pygtk one.\nCan anyone help me?\n\nA: Getting started quickly, so to say\nThe easiest thing to do is to base your first template on an existing one, and modify it to your needs. After running the following command, you'll have an ubuntu-application-qt template based on the ubuntu-application original template. You'll find it on /home/$USER/quickly-templates, ready to modify to your heart's content:\nquickly quickly ubuntu-application ubuntu-application-qt\n\nBackground\nHere are some resources that will help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Didier Roché's post on how to create a quickly template\n\n*Use the IMPORT statement from the Quickly template language to import a subset of commands from an existing template. Here's an example taken from the ubuntu-cli template\nQuickly templates can be written in whatever language you want. They are just a set of commands in a directory, containing commands to copy images, documents and interacting with the user.\nAdding a command is quite easy: just drop it into the root template directory (data/templates in the Quickly source tree, or in /usr/share/quickly/templates/) and make it executable. Quickly will know by this way that the current file is a command that Quickly Core can launch.\nConsequently, if you need additional internal commands that can be launched only by your own commands, just create a subdirectory in your template and add it there.\nThere are also some helpers if you need those names when creating a new command:\nfrom quickly import templatetools\n\npython_name = templatetools.python_name(project_name)\nsentence_name, camel_case_name = templatetools.conventional_names(project_name)\n\nAnd to load the project_name (see the blog post above on part 6):\nif not configurationhandler.project_config:\n    configurationhandler.loadConfig()\n\n", "Q: Unity Freezes when i change the brightness of notebook screen on an Acer Timeline 4810T Every time that i try to increase or decrease the luminosity of my screen using the keys shortcuts provided in my notebook's keyboard (acer timeline 4810T), unity freezes and the only thing i can do to recover is restart the computer.\nthere is a app or a command that i use to recover unity?\nthanks.\n\nA: Recovering Unity Without Restarting\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a virtual console. Log in with your username and password. As you enter your password, you won't see anything change, but that's OK.\nYou'll get a shell prompt (which ends like $ _). Run this command:\ncompiz --display :0 --replace\n\nThen press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to go back to the GUI. If that doesn't work, switch back to the first virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and run:\nunity --reset\n\nThen switch back to the GUI (Ctrl+Alt+F7).\nOne of those will probably work. You don't have to log out in the virtual console, but if you want to (for example, so that people can't switch to it when you're logged out or have a locked screen), you can do that by running the command exit in it.\nRestarting Safely, If You Have To\nIf you find you do have to restart your computer, you should avoid hard resets. Instead, you can switch to a virtual console Ctrl+Alt+F1, then reboot with Ctrl+Alt+Delete.\nIf that doesn't work, you can do something that is nearly as powerful as a hard reboot, but which decreases the risk of data loss and other possible negative outcomes of hard rebooting.

See this page for a simple explanation of what that does, and this Wikipedia article for more detailed information.\nReporting the Bug\nSince you've found a bug, I recommend reporting it--this should help get it fixed sooner, plus there might be workarounds you can use to fix it yourself on your computer, which you'd find out by searching for the bug (or by reporting it and finding that your bug is a duplicate of an existing one).\nUbuntu's community documentation explains how to report bugs properly.\n", "Q: Thunderbird download indicator for Unity?

Concretely I experience that the installation of some self-compiled software (webkit-qt) to global directories is broken after some time until I reinstall it. The relevant webkit installation is installed by the package management at the same time to fullfill dependencies. So each time I install I certainly overwrite some of these files. Please don't tell me that this is not nice to do. I am aware of it. I am just wondering if there is some mechanism in ubuntu which restores the old version of the files (other than the package management if I reinstall some package of course)!\n\nA: If you want to divert files associated with packages that are installed (or that you intend to install), so that you can replace them with your own files but restore them later, you should use the dpkg-divert command.\nSince I don't have all the details of your situation, it would be hard for me to recommend specific syntax, beyond the information provided in that manual page.\nOther than the package manager and the tools that are part of it (including dpkg-divert), there is no part of Ubuntu that modifies the files in /usr, though if you download and run installer executables, or you build software from source and specify an installation prefix of /usr, then files will be added or overwritten. Most software you build from source and install with sudo make install will, by default, have PREFIX=/usr/local, but some software defaults to PREFIX=/usr so it's worth checking by running ./configure --help or reading the Makefile, before you build and install the software.\nThe other exception is parts of /usr like /usr/local that are intended to be changed by facilities other than the package manager. But you don't seem to be asking about that. The contents of directories like /usr/bin and /usr/lib should only be modified by the package manager, unless you modify them manually or tell a third-party installer or build process to put files there.\n", "Q: Run a PostgreSQL instance locally I'm trying to follow this tutorial, but at the beginning it says to run a postgresql instance \"locally\" instead of as a daemon using the following commands.\n$ initdb pg\n$ postgres -D pg &\n$ createdb shouter\n\nSo I've got a new 12.04 install (VMWare on Win7, if that matters) and did under my login:\n$ sudo apt-get install postgresql\n$ initdb pg\n$ postgres -D pg\n\nThis gives me an error saying:\nLOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Address already in use\nHINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.\nWARNING:  could not create listen socket for \"localhost\"\nFATAL:  could not create any TCP/IP sockets\n\nI figure this means installing the server caused it to run the daemon automatically.  I'd prefer just running on the default port like in the tutorial, but I tried running a different port anyway:\n$ postgres -D pg -p 5555\nFATAL:  could not create lock file \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5555.lock\": Permission denied\n\nI've followed various other examples on different ways to install postgresql but all to no avail.  How do I get past this error so that postgres -D pg can execute successfully?\n*note I'm perfectly willing to create a brand new VM, so if you've got instructions on how to do this with a fresh install, that'd be terrific.\n\nA: So the first thing is to stop the server.  That's done as follows: \nsudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop\n\nThat was easy enough.  So the rest is permissions, so apparently chmod is the solution in step 3 below.  (Newbies google chmod for some insight).  You have to allow write access to all users to the \"socket directory\".  Apparently that's just a Debian problem; they modified the postgresql source code in their repo; the \"socket directory\" in the unmodified postgres source is \"/tmp\", which has by default free write permissions.  However the Debian distro changed that to \"/var/run/postgresql\", which is readonly for non-owners.  So you just have to make that writeable.  Here's the full pre-tutorial install script from a virgin 12.04 Ubuntu VM.\nsudo apt-get install postgresql\nsudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop\nsudo chmod a+w /var/run/postgresql\necho 'PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin' >> .bashrc\n. .bashrc\n\nsudo apt-get install leiningen\n\nmkdir clojure\ncd clojure\nlein new shouter\ncd shouter\ngedit project.clj\n  change to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-web-application\n\ninitdb pg\npostgres -D pg &\ncreatedb shouter\nexport DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/shouter\nlein repl\n\nTo keep it from auto-starting on port 5432: Edit the /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/start.conf file.\n\nA: Assuming you don't have admin access on the computer, the solution is to run Postgres with a new configuration file and tell it to create the unix socket in a directory where you already have write permission.\nInitialize a new data directory, here named db.\ninitdb -D db\n\nEdit configuration file db/postgresql.conf. Find the line that specifies the unix_socket_directories and change it for example to the current directory (that would be the data directory named db, not the directory from which you are running postgres)\nunix_socket_directories='.'\n\nYou can now run Postgres with\npostgres -D db\n\nand create a first database, giving an absolute filepath to the unis socket in the -h option\ncreatedb -h `pwd`/. customers\n\nYou may also want to change the default port, either in the config, or by running postgres with something like -p 5555\nThe connection description in your program is then going to be for example\n(def psql\n  {:subprotocol \"postgresql\"\n   :subname \"//localhost/shouter\"})\n\nIf you changed the port from the default 5433, you have to specify it there, something like \"//localhost:5555/shouter\".\nAs a side note, the JDBC driver does not support connecting to the database via Unix sockets, only via TCP/IP sockets.\nsource: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/config-setting.html#CONFIG-SETTING-CONFIGURATION-FILE\n", "Q: Unable to save resume file.

I'd like to switch between different ubuntu sound mixer profiles, depending on what sound hardware I plug in or wirelessly activate. \nThe easiest way I think I can do this would be to have a script for each profile, which sets the hardware and volume levels. Would alsa be the program I'd be writing a script for? Or would it be for something else? Or is it pulse audio? I'm kinda confused. \nThanks. \n\nA: Since there are no other answers, I will try to help with some remarks.\nIn general, it is possible to setup your system in such a way that plugging an audio interface (say, via USB) would trigger a change in, say, sound volume. For this you will need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new (or modify an existing) Udev rule so that plugging/unplugging a specific external soundcard launches a specific application (presumably a script).\n\n*create a Bash script that performs the necessary changes in the configuration of your sound system. For example, you might create several sound mixer profiles in different files, and have your script set a symlink to the desired profile.\n\n\nBoth steps are non-trivial, but realizable nonetheless.\n", "Q: Upgrade to 12.04 LTS from 11.10 I initiated an upgrade to 12.04 from 11.10.

You may also try removing and re-installing the ubuntu-desktop meta-package and see if everything is installed.\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nStill, without knowing what these \"errors\" you speak of are, nor the state of your apt or machine it's hard to know what else to recommend for you outside of a fresh install.\n\nA: The missed cleanup phase shouldn't cause any errors but, just to be safe, you can run\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nwhich will uninstall unneeded packages. This is probably most of what the cleanup phase was about to do before it exited. \nIf your problem persists, you may want to consider a full reinstall.

For example, in this case, we'll have to run in the server xrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"  85.86  1368 1440 1584 1800  768 769 772 795  -HSync +Vsync\n\n*In 5 we've created a newmode in xrandr, now we need to add it to the virtual screen, as follows xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 \"1368x768_60.00\" (please remember to use your own newly created mode name, which is the value including quotes in 5).\n\n*Run x11vnc -usepw -nocursorshape -nocursorpos -noxinerama -solid -repeat -forever -clip CLIENT_WIDTHxCLIENT_HEIGHT+SERVER_WIDTH+0. As an example: x11vnc -usepw -nocursorshape -nocursorpos -noxinerama -solid -repeat -forever -clip 1368x768+1920+0. This will create a VNC server in port 5900 you can connect to.\n\n*Lastly, connect to the server from you other computer (or any VNC client, recommended krdc for linux machines). You should be able to enjoy your extended screen now.\n\nNotes and considerations:\n\n*\n\n*In step 8, with krdc, it is recommended to use the \"Medium Quality\" option, even if you are on cable: both the \"Low\" and \"High\" quality options produce errors.\n\n*I tried this over a WiFi network and it works properly, however on cable it's smoother.\n\n*I had problems when starting the VNC server in step 7, the screen started to flicker and I couldn't see what I was doing on the screen. To fix this, I connected via the VNC server (the extended screen already works at this point), opened the Displays tool (the one that comes with the system where you can see the displays that are connected) and Unify Outputs then Break Unified Outputs\n(an example of this option in Kubuntu is shown below). Then everything worked.\n\n\n\nA: http://www.virtualgl.org even allows openGL!\n", "Q: Everything is slow after installing  i took the leap today. downloaded 12.04 LTS, burned the ISO to a CD ROM. \nFirst i clicked the \"try it out\" option. Then i installed it on my HP Pavilion DV2000. \nFirst time it started up, i downloaded some drivers, since there was no WIFI driver working. Also updated 2 NVIDIA drivers. it told me it needed to restart. \nSo I restarted...\nWhen booting up it takes a looong time. Finally I can type in my password. it shows me the default background and nothing else. after about 30 seconds the background image sort of disolves. then come back. i wait around 5 - 10 minutes. Nothing happens at all.. just the orange default background. i hold down the power button. booting up again. same deal sort of. first i get to enter my password really quick. hit enter. default background image and mouse cursor icon. nothing else happens. \ni wait for about 5 minutes, still nothing happens. i try right clicking. aha! i can create a new folder and change background. basically the standard Ubuntu right click on desktop menu. but the folder window and settings and everything else has no top navigation. like expand, minimize or the \"x\" close folder icon. \ni look around what i can access, and i see that i have 130 updates. that could fix it i think to my self. update all.. still the same thing. \ni kinda went all in and choose to only boot Ubuntu. No windows or anything else, so can anyone give some tips on what i could try to fix it?\n\nA: You said installed 2 Nvidia drivers.I think both are mixed up and creating the problem.Please follow this(this is an answer for another post which I copy here)\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-current\n\nIf you type that into the terminal, it will remove the propriatry drivers and go back to the stock drivers. I was having a similar issue and reformed the other day to figure out that the issues seem to be from the latest propriatary drivers. Once I uninstalled it and rebooted, everything was back to normal. Hope it helps!\n(Thanx to Tommy)\n\nA: I reinstalled 12.04 three times before i got it to work right... I have found its easier to start over than it is to fix an error ....getting nvidia working right first thing made all the difference. \nIf i were you i would reinstall and before ever logging in go to repair option and go to a prompt then follow the following commands ...\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nsudo apt-get install -f \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nthen.. sudo su   ...and type..  reboot\n(the x-server is just as important as the drivers you need it all) maybe try all this at repair or any prompt (ctrl+alt+f1) before reinstalling it might fix it all \nif you try before reinstalling do this first to remove anything that might be in the way\nsudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\nsudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia-current \n\n", "Q: None of the tools in the GIMP 2.8 toolbox are functional I am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a 64bit machine. I recently upgraded to Gimp 2.8 with no problems. All user interface items appear to work - except - none of the tools in the toolbox are functional. Attempts to crop, move, brush, etc. change the cursor but perform no action.  I went to the .gimp-2.8 file (in home) and found all files to be empty.\nI then went to /usr/share/gimp and found files under gimp 2.0 and tried copying them to the .gimp-2.8 file but with no luck.

Evince now handles comments written in other pdf markup software (e.g. Adobe), which is very nice.  Unfortunately, it chooses a yellow font on a white background that is almost impossible to read (though highlighting the comment with the mouse helps).  Is there any way to change this behavior?  \n\n(Adobe's acroread displays these correctly but is terribly slow and not a native open-source, so I'd prefer a different alternative).  \n\nA: I browsed very quickly the source code but couldn't find a way to change it or propose a patch, but I will try to do it later.\nAnyway, for the time being I made a bug report on the proper place https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=677471 so now we wait if it is answered by the team.\n", "Q: Completely upgrading to Ubuntu I am thinking of fully upgrading to Ubuntu. I already have it dual booted with Windows Vista and Ubuntu (only from a CD). If I were to completely upgrade to Ubuntu. Would there be any problems? Im paranoid of upgrading my OS so I just want to be sure.\nEDIT: I want to be only Ubuntu. If I were to install it from the CD would vista be gone? I want only Ubuntu. I cannot dual boot on my laptop as there is  only one hard drive and I don't know how to partition.\n\nA: I have been playing with Ubuntu since V 7.04\nI have been dual booting with Windows the entire time. There are a few times I went 100% ubuntu, and with my lack of expertise, lost tonnes of my data when I had problems with Ubuntu. \nMy recommendation is that you have 3 partitions, a Windows one, a Ubuntu one, and a media one. Keep all important files and media on your media partition which you will be able to access from either operating system (if you make Media NTFS both OS can read / write to it)\nLong story short, don't get rid of Windows until you are very secure with Linux. Ubuntu provides by far the easiest Linux OS to use. But it's a risk to move over everything all at once. (From my experience any ways.)\n\nA: I guess there's a couple of choices. First you can install it over Windows, secondly you can install it, but as a second OS with Windows (dual booting).\nI would advise against the single boot in your case which would wipe out windows.\nI would go for install as a dual boot system, should be ok.\nMost of my pc's have windows and Ubuntu dual boots.  Windows is basically there when I get it anyway.\nMake sure you save ALL files on cloud and hard (local) media before doing anything!!! \nWhenever messing with OS's you are taking a chance (just see others horror stories here, so backup, backup, backup (and test the backups) and allow plenty of time and the possibility of some complete failures for unknown reasons.\n\nA: Well I have lost my data quite a few times too but i would not at all ask you to change your thoughts of quiting windows..!!\nCoz its Best...!! ;)\nwhat you can do is create 2/3 partitions where you keep your media and one partition for Ubuntu...I do this myself after a year of Experience...\nYou can always recover through LIVE CD/USB if you have these partitions...\nAnd also having a backup of the data in your ubuntu partition on UBUNTU ONE or other cloud services like DROPBOX is a great idea...The online(cloud) backup has helped me recently..!!!\nSo now i have my data from the ubuntu partition back too along withe thae data that  remained intact in the other partitions... :)\nHope to see you upgrade to complete Ubuntu..!! :)\n\nA: Actually I'm going to recommend you create three partitions for Ubuntu: one for / (this should be about 20 GB), one for /home, and one swap (the swap partition should be the same size as your amount of RAM or larger). The reason I recommend this is if your operating system gets botched you can reinstall it without touching any of the info in your home folder. If you install the operating system on the same partition as your /home directory you'll have to format everything and risk losing your files. \nIt's hard to migrate from Windows to Ubuntu, but it sounds like you're ready. When you're ready to get rid of Windows and install Ubuntu just delete any partitions that are on the hard drive and create those three partitions I described above. \nBefore you make the switch make sure you're aware of all the different Linux alternative programs for the programs you're used to on Windows. Also make sure all your files are in formats that can be used in Ubuntu, and change formats if necessary. \n", "Q: iptables problem Hi guys i have the follwoing iptables file for my ubuntu 12.04 server. ITs a bit messy because i tried different ways to fix it but the problem is it doesnt allow apt commands such as apt-get to run. It shows connecting to archive.ubuntu.com and the connection times out. I guess it has something to do with the outgoing rules but im not sure. The exact same  issue appeared with using UFW too. Can you please advice me as to how to fix/improve my iptables structure or maybe a fix for UFW to work. Thanks!\nUPDATED::\n\n\n Completed on Mon May 14 23:09:19 2012\n# Generated by iptables-save v1.4.12 on Mon May 14 23:09:19 2012\n*filter\n:INPUT DROP [0:0]\n:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1/32 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -m limit --limit 5/min -j LOG --log-prefix \"iptables denied\" --log-level 7\n-A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 0 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --sport 53 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p udp -m udp --sport 53 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\nCOMMIT\n# Completed on Mon May 14 23:09:19 2012\n\n\nA: You have redundant rules, all OUTPUT rules (A OUTPUT) are redundant due to the -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT rule (\"accept all outgoing traffic\"). This rule itself is unnecessary if you set the OUTPUT policy to ACCEPT instead of DROP (\"accept all outgoing traffic if no rule match\" vs \"ignore/drop all outgoing traffic if no rule match\"). To set the policy, use:\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT\n\n(the counters are not necessary and have been removed as well). Since your OUTPUT chain is fine, have a look at your input chain. I see no obvious issues, the line that allows existing TCP connections (including handshake packets) and DNS responses are present:\n-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nAs a debugging aid, I suggest you to use the -v (--verbose) flag for rule match counters. My favorite for having statistics, updated every second:\nsudo watch -n1 iptables -vnL\n\nIt could be an issue that is not related to iptables. Perhaps your routing tables are wrong, DNS servers are invalid or upstream routers blocks your traffic.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which INPUT rules do I need to add to iptables so apt (apt-get, aptitude) can work (update, upgrade, search, install)?\n\nA: I think the easiest way to figure this out is to flush all the rules and re-add them one by one until it stops working. Mind you that if you're doing this from a remote, that your default DROP policy can disconnect you when you blindly flush / zero all rules.\n", "Q: With Xmonad / GNOME, switch gnome-panel between monitors I'm using gnome with Xmonad as my window manager on Ubuntu 11.10.

I know this floating thing is one of the things that make Gimp special, but it's not the kind of \"special\" that I like... I don't have a huge screen, so it quickly gets too cramped. And I often use Gimp briefly, multitasking with other apps, so the many Gimp windows are annoying.\nHow can I make Gimp run in one window, with everything else inside it? \nThis is Gimp 2.6.11 -- just because that's what came with my Ubuntu 11.10 installation.\n\nA: Select \"Single-Window Mode\" from the Windows menu item.

On that machine, I have a shared folder named \"projects\". I tried\nsudo mount -t smbfs smb://192.168.2.28/projects/myProject /mnt/myProject\non my Ubuntu 11.10 and got the error:\n\nMounting cifs URL not implemented yet. Attempt to mount smb://192.168.2.28/projects/myProject.\n\nHow can I do to solve it? I need to mount the folder to use it with NetBeans.\n\nA: Since as the error message says CIFS URLs (starting with smb://) are not supported, you have to use the \"classic\" syntax to identify the server and share. Furthermore, you cannot mount a folder within a share as though it is a share--you should mount the share and then access the folder within it. You can make a symbolic link to the folder inside the share,  if necessary. Finally, when you run smbmount, mount -t smbfs, or similar remote mount commands as root (for example, with sudo), you need to specify the username on the server (unless it's actually root, which is unlikely and, if the server runs a Unix-like system, not recommended).\nSo first, you'll create a folder (mount point) for the share:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/projects\n(This is assuming you want to create it in /mnt. It's become more common to create all globally accessible mount points that aren't part of your Ubuntu system itself in /media instead of /mnt but it's fine to use /mnt if you like.)\nThen use a command like this to mount the share:\nsudo smbmount //192.168.2.28/projects /mnt/projects -o user=USERNAME\nReplace USERNAME with the username on the Samba server that you need to log in as. You'll be prompted for your password. You can specify your password on the command-line too (with -o password=PASSWORD) but it will appear in cleartext in the Terminal and will go into your command history, so you probably don't want to do that.\nYou'll notice that I've used smbmount but mount -t smbfs or mount -t cifs (or mount.cifs) should work just as well, if you prefer.\nNow smb://192.168.2.28/projects's contents are accessible in /mnt/projects. If you need to be able to access the contents of smb://192.168.2.28/projects/myProject in /mnt/projects/myProject, you can create a symbolic link:\nsudo ln -s /mnt/projects/myProject /mnt/myProject\nFor readers of Ubuntu 12.10 and later: You must use mount.cifs or mount -t cifs (smbmount and mount -t smbfs are no longer provided). The cifs-utils  package is required. These commands will work on earlier systems too.\n\nA: In order to permanently mount your SMB share use the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a folder for mounting the share on (for example /mnt/windows):\nsudo mkdir [mount point]\n\n\n*Change its permissions\nsudo chown [username]:[username] [mount point]\n\n\n*Create a file containing your domain credentials (I use /home/[user]/.smbcredentials)\nusername=[domain user]\npassword=[domain password]\ndomain=[domain]\n\n\n*Add the following line to /etc/fstab\n//[smb hostname]/[share name]/        [mount point]  cifs        credentials=[credentials file path],rw,uid=[user],user       0       0\n\n\n*Run (only once, on reboot this will happen automagically)\nsudo mount [mount point]\n\nTested to work on Ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: While the accepted answer is correct, you can now mount a folder within a samba share with help from 3 packages:\nsamba-client\nsamba-common\ncifs-utils\n\nThese are CentOS base repo packages (sorry, no longer an Ubuntu user so can't check) but I'm confident there's something similar for Ubuntu.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04 I mounted a shared smb directory directly via the filebrowser, no command line fiddling required.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file browser, then click +Other locations\n\n*Enter server address eg smb://shared.foo.ac.uk\n\n*Click \"Connect\" and enter your credentials if necessary\n", "Q: How to tell if squid-deb-proxy is working?

I do not care about any of my files, everything is replaceable. \nAnyway, if I were to partition, would Ubuntu automatically install to the partition as a dual boot?\n\nA: If you boot from an Ubuntu install CD/DVD or USB flash drive, run the installer, and select the option to install alongside existing operating systems, the installer will attempt to automatically shrink down your Windows Vista partition and create the partitions Ubuntu needs in the newly freed unpartitioned space.\nThis usually succeeds, but sometimes doesn't. If it's unable to shrink the Windows Vista partition because of files that cannot be moved, then you should try shrinking the Windows Vista partition in Disk Management in Windows Vista. (This functionality is not available prior to Windows Vista; for example, in Windows XP you cannot use Disk Management to do this.) You can run Disk Management in Windows Vista or Windows 7 by typing in diskmgmt.msc in the textbox at the bottom of the Start Menu, then pressing Enter.\nIf the Ubuntu installer cannot shrink the Windows Vista partition and you cannot shrink it with Disk Management in Windows Vista, try disabling swap (i.e. paging) and hibernation and trying again in Disk Management. (Afterwards, you can re-enable swap and hibernation.)\nFor greater customization during installation, you can select Do something else and manually partition (but only if you know how). Alternatively you can manually partition using the GParted Partition Editor on the live CD/DVD/USB before running the installer. But most users who want to run Ubuntu and another OS on the same machine are pretty well served by automatically installing Ubuntu alongside their other operating system.\n", "Q: How to get the 'right click + scroll' feature of VistaSwitcher in Ubuntu? When using Windows I use VistaSwitcher to scroll through open windows. I have used Compiz to set Ctrl+Scroll to next and prev windows but I'd (ideally) like something with the ability to see the windows as I scroll.\nMany thanks!\nJames\n\nA: In CompizConfig Settings Manager  activate the plugins \"Ring Switcher\" or \"Shift Switcher\". You can set your preferred shortcuts there, too.\nScreenshot of Shift Switcher in action from compiz.org:\n\n(More about these plugins on compiz.org.)\nBut be aware: CCSM is an advanced tool. Use with caution. This tool allows you to deeply configure Compiz's settings. Some options may be incompatible with each other. Unless used with care, it is possible to be left with an unusable desktop.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Tweak Updates every day. Is this correct? When I did a fresh install of 12.04 a few weeks ago I run the Update Manager every day.  \nEveryday Ubuntu Tweak gets updated. I wouldn't mind but nothing seems to change in the application.  The first few days I thought there was back-end stuff getting updated.

And there are a handful of great flash games.\nIs it possible to download HTML5 or flash games and play them offline in Ubuntu? \nFor example, I setup an Angry Birds launcher in Unity,but I can only play it online. Would be great to know, thank you!\n\nA: Some (but not all) Flash games store their game data in your temporary internet files folder. The catch is the file is not going to be named anything normal, so you have to search through all the .swf files in your temporary folder to find it. As far as I know you can't do the same thing with HTML5 however. \n", "Q: Prevent usb tethered device from claiming default route? I'm tethering an android device over USB.  When tether is accomplished,  the device sets the usb0 interface as the default route.\nI do not want this (usually,  the host device has wlan0) but do not see a simple way to change in Ubuntu.  dhcpcd does not have the --nohook option and --nogateway also doesn't seem to work in this case.\n'route del' and 'route add' can obviously be used,  but are quite..... a hardcoded solution,  since they require the actual IPs etc.\nAny ideas?  TIA. \nNo solution so far-- could obviously be scripted.\n\nA: Open Networking > Wired Connections > Click on Android USB Tether > IPv4 > Routes > Tick \"use only for resources on this network\". \nThis will make it skip adding the default route to this connection, making whatever other connection the default one. \n\nA: I guess a simple solution wwould be to not activate tethering on your Android when its not needed. I'm not sure if that is what you are asking, or if you want a more technical way of doing this via Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can I suppress the last-minute 'writing to disk' dialogue when umounting?

It does not connect to my Wireless Access Point (WAP). How can I fix this? I have a wireless access point at home and I can't connect with my laptop which uses Kubuntu 12.04.\nMy wifi access point is configured to hide the SSID and use WPA2 Personal encryption.\n\nA: When you scan for a wireless network, do you see your access point? \nIn any case try playing with some different security settings. Connectivity issues can sometimes be caused by incompatibilities between your wireless card, router, and security settings. In other words, this is not necessarily an Ubuntu issue :)  \nYou might also look at the question linked below for some answers which might help you. \nWifi Connectivity problems when using WPA/WPA2 Encryption\n\nA: Stop hiding the SSID and see if that makes a difference. Here is a link to a site I found with a Google search. It provides more detail on why hiding an SSID is not a good thing to do. \nA simple Google search will turn up other sites which offer the same advice. The search will probably also return a number of claims by well-intentioned yet mistaken individuals claiming hiding the SSID tightens security. \nIgnore them. \nThey apparently do not know how to use Google so how much trust can you place in what they say? And how is it no one ever wagged a finger at them and told them that  \"obscurity is not security\"\nIf you want to dig into the documentation you can try starting at the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki's Wireless Networking Central.\n\nA: The following command will most probably solve the issue: \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source\n\n", "Q: How to switch workspace with mouse wheel in Unity I had this feature in 11.10 after using a tweak by Ubuntu tweak.

All of the write ups advise you select the drive (but didn't mention being able to select a partition on a drive). I would like to install it to one of my partitions on my 2nd drive, where however if only a drive is available, then I assume it will install it into Windows/Programs?\nMy last question, is that when uninstalled, I assume it removes the Ubuntu loader selection from whereever it is loaded from, per my first question above?\n\nA: When you install Wubi, the default installation location is C:/ubuntu.  You can change the partition to install wubi, but the location will always be DRIVE:/ubuntu  .\nI'm not sure what you mean by the first question, but after you install wubi, it adds a Ubuntu entry (which leads to GRUB) in the Windows Boot Menu without rewriting the MBR.  When you remove wubi, the uninstaller will remove the ubuntu entry.\nIf you really messed up the MBR, I recommend downloading EasyBCD which allows you to modify the Windows Boot Menu.\n", "Q: I just cannot seem to partition...(Windows Vista) All day I have been trying to partition my 285.62 GB hard drive on my laptop. I tried to disable hibernation and disabling swap (i.e paging), but it still doesn't work. After doing both of those, and restarting, I still have 3806 MB of available shrink space according to Disk Management. Any tips please? Or will Ubuntu automatically partition my hard drive anyway?\nMore Information:\nI have Ubuntu already installed on my comp (only boot-able from a CD at the moment)\nI want to have at least 50 GB set away for Ubuntu, yet the Disk Manager only allows for 3 GB.\nI have an HP Pavilion Dv6 laptop\nI don't know what more you want?\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu, it will ask you if you want to A) erase all partitions/data and install a fresh setup B) partition the hard drive between Windows Vista and Ubuntu, thus creating a dual boot.\nIf you select to partition, you will then decide how much space to allocate to Ubuntu and windows.\nNow if you still want to partition before installing, ill explain some basics. First of all, you can not edit partitions awhile the hard drive is mounted. Mounted means in use and communiting with your computer. So you can't edit the partitions on your Windows Vista hard drive while using it. You will have to use a Ubuntu live usb, boot into Ubuntu, unmount your vista hdd, then finally use gparted to edit your partitions. You could also install a second hard drive (if its a desktop) and then boot into whatever OS is on the hard drive, finally proceeding to unmout the vista hard drive, etc.\nA word of caution: manually partitioning is very dangerous! Even erasing an empty partition of swap space can render all your data unreachable. Data recovery is messy business that you don't want to get caught in. The wisest action would be to let the Ubuntu partition do all the partitioning. \nIf this doesn't address your issue tell me in a comment.\n", "Q: How can I get the computer to sleep while at the login screen?

Lastly when I'm logged in why am I not able to run ubuntu programs like gedit or access files that are on my computer?\n\nA: SSH is short for secure shell. Its a program which allows you to access the terminal for a remote machine as though you were physically connected to it.\nthot.cs.pitt.edu is the domain name of the machine you're connecting to. Its like google.com; just less memorable in your case.\nThe commands you execute are running on the remote machine. You cant run gedit, for example, because ssh only allows text transmission, and gedit is obviously a graphical editor. (NB, nano is a friendly command line text editor).\nTo access local files on the remote machine, you should look at the scp command (secure copy)\n", "Q: Diablo II resolution hack error Hi I recently installed Diablo II and wanted to use the mod to allow higher resolutions.

The machine I'm connecting to is a 64 bit x86 Linux machine.  My computer is also 64 bit Ubuntu machine with an x86 processor.\nI need to hand in program assignments that compile with gcc and run on remote machine or they will not be graded.  The professor mentioned that gcc may compile programs differently on different machines and that C not completely portable like Java.\nMy question is can I write my programs in gedit and debug them with gdb on my computer and upload them with scp (if I do the work by sshing into the remote unix terminal I can only use nano/pico/vim)? Or will my computer compile differently then the remote machine? Again, they are both x86 64bit Linux machines.\n\nA: If you submit the binary (I would be surprised if you had to do that) it will work (since you mentioned that the architecture of both the machines are same), most probably, unless there is a difference of the installed libraries and you actually end up using some of them.\nBut assuming that you just have to submit the source code, your code will be compiled on the remote server. This means that as long as you are not using some specific library present on your system, your programs will compile and run on the remote server. But if you end up using such a library, you can specify the linking flags (in your Makefile or mention it explicitly as part of your submission).\n\nA: As @rhn-grg pointed out, if both machines have the same processor architecture, then the only difference which may prevent your binary from running on another machine is the libraries which your binary is linked against - by default binaries are linked so they load the libraries dynamically which allows to keep the binaries small and also allows to use RAM more efficiently since the library is loaded once but can be used by multiple processes.\nHowever, in cases where you need to ensure \"portability\" of a binary, you can tell gcc to link the binary statically - i.e. include all libraries it uses into the binary - this will produce a rather large binary but it will not depend on any external libraries.\nI never had a need to do this, however, now when you know the magic words (static linking, portable binary) you can find many suggestions in Google, for example this:\n\nNormally, when you download a tarball of source code, you'll do the\n  standard \"configure; make; make install\" to build it. If you want a\n  statically linked binary, replace the plain \"make\" with:\nmake SHARED=0 CC='gcc -static'\n\n\nTo see which libraries your binary depends on, you can use ldd command:\n$ ldd /bin/bash\n    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff6dbff000)\n    libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007f8e37337000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f8e37133000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f8e36d75000)\n    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8e37587000)\n\n\nA: The issue your professor was probably alluding to is that the sizes of various types in C are platform dependent.  For instance, you will be able to store much larger numbers in long variables if they are compiled for an x86-64 Linux system, compared to when they are compiled for i386 Linux.  For correct programs this isn't a problem, but if you have a program that e.g. uses int and long interchangeably, it may work fine on i386 but fail when run on 64 bit systems.\nIn contrast, Java uses the same size for basic types on all platforms, so avoids this class of portability problem.\nIf both your development system and the remote system are x86-64 Linux, then you shouldn't run into any of these sorts of differences.  You shouldn't have any problem writing and debugging your programs locally.\nWith that in mind, if you are graded based on how your program behaves on the remote system it would be worth while testing your finished programs on the remote system.\n", "Q: How to use animations as window effects in Compiz? I recently installed the compiz-plugins-extra in Ubuntu 12.04, And I have animations add-on enabled, But none of the extra features (such as airplane, dissolve, explode, etc.) work. Is there something else I need to install to make these work or what?\n\nA: After you enable the animation add-ons, logout and login again. That's how they appeared for me.\n\nA: Download and install compizconfig-settings-manager and open it by typing ccsm in the dash. In the CCSM's window, in the effects tab, in the animations settings, you can change the various animations type for open windows, close windows, minimize and various others.\nand also see this\n\n\nA: Enable both the \"Animations\" and \"Animations Add-On\" plugin in the CompizConfig Settings Manager.\nCan you verify you are actually running Compiz? Run this command in a terminal: pidof compiz. If you don't get any output, you are running Unity 2D, which uses Metacity, in stead of Compiz. Which means that none of the Compiz plugins/effects will work for you. If you get a number as output, you're running Compiz, and my doing what I stated above should work.\n\nA: Sometimes compiz won't renew itself when activating plugins.

(increasing performance idea) There seems to be lag whenever I start typing something in dashboard search, looking for an application. This could potentially be very fast, like typing Win \"dwar\" enter, runs dwarf fortress. But there's a lag while typing \"dwar\", starting on the letter \"d\". \nI believe this lag is caused by the system fetching the icons. I'd like to disable this function and have the dashboard be text-only. \nNote: the hud only has to show one icon at a time and look how much faster that is? It must be the icons. \nSuggestions? \nedit: Note that I'm currently running Ubuntu 2D. \n\nA: You can not disable icons at the moment, unless you want to delete all your icon sets (you dont). But icons arent what is slowing your dash. The main cause is the blur in the background of the dash, that can cause a second of lag. Through compiz config (ccsm) you can disable blur, or set it to static.\nDisabling blur makes the dash faster, but it can make reading the dash text difficult. Static blur is again faster than active blur, the only difference is that the image behind the dash doesn't change (example if a popup appears awhile the dash is open, you won't see it appear behind.  \nI highly recommended you try the blur options. Also use 12.04, unity is much faster! Unity 2D also offers a nice speed boost.\n", "Q: Tunneling & Bypass proxy are there any software for ubuntu to tunneling/bypass proxy (HTTP/S, SOCK4/5).

Does anyone have any pointers?\n\nA: You can move content area (GtkVBox) from GtkDialog to another GtkContainer, and then append to GtkNotebook - using gtk.Widget.reparent() method.\nabout = Gtk.AboutDialog()\nabout.set_program_name (\"Application\")\nabout.set_copyright (\"Author\")\n\nbox = Gtk.VBox ()\nabout.vbox.reparent (box)\nnotebook.append_page (box, Gtk.Label(\"About\"))\nabout.destroy ()\n\nWith interface created in Glade, You must do simple trick for this solution. Create \"About\" tab in notebook with appended GtkBox (with id for example \"about_box\"). Then you can do something like this:\nbox = builder.get_object (\"about_box\")\nabout.vbox.reparent (box)\n\nIn some reasons Glade's GtkAboutDialog content area contains also GtkButtonBox. If You don't need this buttons simply destroy them:\nabout.action_area.destroy()\n\nIf You want only 'Credits' button, without 'Close' button, do something like this:\nclose_button = about.get_widget_for_response(Gtk.ResponseType.CANCEL)\nclose_button.destroy()\n\n", "Q: How do I use DFeet? I've been trying for a half hour to get D-Feet to open a service, any service with the Connect button. I feel I am misunderstanding this application at a basic level. What am I missing?\n\nA: Go to the File menu, select \"Connect to session bus\" or \"Connect to system bus\"\n\nA: You do not enter a service address into DFeet. The connect button is for the address of the System / Session bus. Yes, the overlap in D-Bus related vocabulary is arcane and stupid.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get your System or Session Bus address. For regular applications, you're probably looking for the Session Bus address.

I would like to improve my programming skills so that I can contribute to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Source code of all programs which Ubuntu is composed from is not stored in one central location because it is developed and maintained by thousands of independent developers. So it would be easier to choose a project you're interested in and then trying to find its source.\nExample: from the top of my head, I decided to find the source repository of Transmission, the BitTorrent client shipped with Ubuntu. A short Google search lead me to http://www.transmissionbt.com/ where, in the Download section, I found a source tarball. You can download it, read compilation instructions, try to compile, then read the code and possibly try to tweak it. Hours of fun guaranteed.\nI couldn't find SVN/Git repository for transmission, but many projects are hosted on sites like github, launchpad or Google Code so their repositories are publicly available. For such projects, it's reasonably easy to push your changes back to the official repository in case you add a useful feature or fix a bug.\nIf you want to start your own project, Ubuntu Developer portal has extensive documentation on using Quickly, a tool for creating applications using Python and pyGTK\n\nA: The source for almost anything you install from the Ubuntu software center or repositories can be easily downloaded using the apt-get command-line tool.  For example, to get the source for transmission (the example given below), you simply type: apt-get source transmission\n", "Q: How to mount a subdirectory of `/home` without making it appear as removable? In my present configuration, my /home lives on a regular spinning hard drive, with the exception of /home/mac/runtime which is a partition from a SSD.\nMy problem is that such partition shows up as a \"removable device\" even if the mount options are such that is not possible for the user to unmount it at all (besides, it is not a removable device, given that it is a partition of an internal hard drive!).\nIndeed my goal would be for the partition layout to be totally transparent (my /boot is on another disk too, but the user wouldn't know, and the /boot doesn't appear as a removable drive).\nThe portion of my /etc/fstab of interest looks like this:\n# /home was on /dev/sdb1 during installation\nUUID=<my-uuid-here>  /home              ext4  noatime,nodiratime   0  2  \n# /home/mac/runtime was on /dev/sda3 during installation\nUUID=<my-uuid-here>  /home/mac/runtime  ext4  noatime,nodiratime   0  2 \n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n\nA: Rather than additionally mounting subdirectories of an already mounted drive let me suggest you mount it separately. You may then create a symlink to that directory in your HOME to make it accessible.\nsudo mkdir -p /media/runtime\n\nThen mount your SSD partition to `media/runtime or edit your /etc/fstab:\nUUID=[uuid] /media/runtime ext4 relatime,errors=remount-ro,discard 0 2\n\nReplace [uuid] by the UUID of your drive. To grant access to this partition create a symlink in your HOME:\nln -s /media/runtime /home/mac/\n\n\nA: After having done some more research I found out that Fedora 16 experienced the same problem. I consequently filed a bug on launchpad and from the subsequent discussion it appears that the behaviour is due to the hot-pluggable nature of SATA devices.\n\nA: Pretty oldish now but I believe, should you wish, you can disable the hotplug features through kernel options (re-compiling a kernel).\n", "Q: Is it normal for 12.04 to occupy almost 4GB? I'm using a ASUS EeePC 901 and have some basic questions/issues. I installed 12.04 on the 4GB drive, selecting the option to erase it before doing so. Immediately after the installation I saw that Update Manager had over 100 updates pending. I attempted to install these, but was told that I had less than 100 MB remaining. Does the OS occupy all the other space?\nIt seems that the best solution is to install 12.04 on the 16GB drive. Is this true?\nIf I do this, what is the best way to erase the 4GB drive afterwards?\n\nA: Here the official help pages.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/\nRequirement when installing Ubuntu\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/amd64/minimum-hardware-reqts.html\nHere the recommend requirement for Ubuntu 12.04 by the community\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements\nOn how to install visit this help pages\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation\n\nA: The best choice (I've tried on my EEE 900 4 GB + 16 GB) is to use manual partition and create on the 16 GB SSD another partition of about 2.5 or 3 GB.\nWhen you install and select the partitions and mounting points you have to select to mount as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount / in the 4 GB partition, so you will get the most of the highest speed of that SSD card when booting up and for main tasks.\n\n*Mount /var in the 2.5 GB partition on the 16 GB SSD. \n\n*Mount /home in the 13.5 GB partition left in the 16 GB SSD.\nThis way you will:\n\n\n*\n\n*use about 3 GB on the 4 GB fast SSD improving your speed.\n\n*let about 1 GB free in the main partition to update, upgrade and to let the system run smoothly.\n\n*will let /var increase up to 2.5 GB without the chance to fill up the / partition and mess it up.\n\n\nI am using this config and works pretty well.\n\nA: It is normal. What happens is that normally the OS takes about 3GB uncompressed, and also uses about 1GB for Swap (the swap partition).\nThe best option is to install on the 16GB drive, and you can wipe the 4GB drive from the installer (using advanced partitioning options) or from Gparted (on a live USB/CD or after installing on the 16.\n\nA: For the past releases of Ubuntu, the consensus was NOT creating the Swap partition, as it was not useful with SSD disks.\nI have also tried installing 12.04 on my 901, but the end result was the same as with Grant: a blank screen.\n", "Q: Can global application menu be made to behave better with GIMP? I actually like the global menu of Unity.\nHowever, for GIMP, it's totally broken and terrible.  Gimp uses multiple unassociated windows for its toolbars, and as soon as a toolbar gets focus the global menu disappears because the window the menu belongs to is not focused.  So you have to switch focus back to the main image window.  It's painful because you need to alternate between using toolbars and using the menu all the time, but every time you use the toolbars the menu disappears.\nMy question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to improve this behaviour in GIMP?  Eg, by not having the toolbars as separate windows, or by setting compiz so it doesn't treat them as such?\n\n*Or failing that, how can I disable the global menu just for one application?\nUsing precise, with Gimp 2.6.12-1ubuntu1\n\nA: Possibly easier is to edit the Exec field in /usr/share/applications/gimp.desktop to\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 gimp-2.6 %U\n\n\nA: This problem has been solved with the latest version of Gimp, In Gimp 2.8 you can use single window mode, Hence no more disappearing global menu.\nInstalling Gimp 2.8:\nGimp 2.8 can be installed by adding PPA for Ubuntu 12.04. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before installing Gimp 2.8 its important to remove the old version of Gimp.\n\n*Hit Alt+Ctrl+T to open terminal and run following commands:\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge gimp\n\n\n*Run the following commands to add the PPA and install Gimp 2.8.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nHow to enable single window mode in Gimp 2.8?\nOpen Gimp and goto Windows menu and select Single-Window Mode\nThat's it!\n\nA: 1 . Open the file for editing:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/gimp.desktop\n\n2 . Locate the following line and delete it\nExec=gimp-2.8 %U\n\n3 . Insert the following line\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 gimp-2.8 %U\n\n4 . Also in the top of the file add the following line\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\nSee the file contents in the picture below:\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/PZTur.png\nSee the result in the picture below:\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/rkl83.png\n\nA: If you want one particular application to not use the global menu you can set a little known (but very useful) environment variable: UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0\nThus, the following entered in a terminal will start gimp with the global-menu disabled:\nUBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 gimp-2.6\n\n\nYou'll note the global menu is disabled for Gimp - it's now with the main Gimp window.\nAs a suggestion, if you launch Gimp via a launcher icon, copy the /usr/share/applications/gimp.desktop file to your home folder ~/.local/share/applications (create if necessary).\nChange the exec= value to a script file - for example /home/dad/launchgimp.sh\nCopy and paste UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 gimp-2.6 into this new file and give it execute rights (chmod +x ~/launchgimp.sh)\nLogout and login. \n", "Q: Blue iMac running Debian will not boot Ubuntu from cd drive I have a older blue iMac that is running Debian linux.(An old version of about 3 years ago without update.

I recently switched from 10.04 to 12.04. I did a fresh install. However I can't configure 5.1 surround with my coaxial/SPDIF home teather, simply because the new sound manager interface doesn't provide options like in 10.04. In 10.04 I could configure 'digital output + analogic input' and everything was ok, but in 12.04 I can't do this.\n\nHow can I change the configuration?\n\nA: Ubuntu disables and hides digital audio output SPDIF in all Realtek / Nvidia Cards by default in fact it  does same in all flavor of Ubuntu.\nThe procedure to fix it is the same in all versions of Ubuntu and works for all sound cards Ati Nvidia Realtek Creative Bosse etc. You need to edit a file to get it to work.  Open a terminal with CtrlAltt and type this:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nthen add this line to the end of the file\noptions snd-hda-intel model=auto    \n\nthen use Ctrlo to save the file and Ctrlx to exit.\nAt this time you need to reboot the machine, and the missing digital audio spdif will be working.

Our fresh install of 12.04 32 bit won't let us switch from digital output to analog. Default will go to analog only if no other sound card hooked up (ie remove USB headphones).\n\nThere is an option in pavucontrol to select between digital and analog outputs but it is not recognized by the default volume control and multiple outputs are not possible (application switching between streams is disabled).\nTry pavucontrol and see if you can access the additional configuration there?\nAlternatively you can do the configuration with pactl via terminal, see the manpage for more details.

I had the Ogg container, Theora for video, and Vorbis for audio.\nI'm not sure right now what version of pitivi comes with 12.04, but I did install 0.15.2 from the sources at the end. Maybe you did the same (installing 0.15.2) but didn't try some other video codec instead of Dirac?\n\nA: This bug was reported on 2011-12-10\nBug 665902 - Render never completes because of a not-linked element\nSee : https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665902\n\nA: I found this thread several years later trying to render a video in Ubuntu 16.04 using Pitivi 0.95\nI found that I was unable to render to mp4 format, but was able to use other formats. avi worked best for me. I realize this is not an acceptable solution for everyone, but if you absolutely need mp4 perhaps you can find some other means to convert to mp4.\n\nA: Use flatpak.

You can use it in case the program doesn't supply a png or when it's just your own simple bash script.\n\nA: You can install by\nsudo apt-get install bzr\n\nthen\nbzr branch lp:unity-launcher-editor\ncd unity-launcher-editor/\n./ule\n\nwhen I tried to create a custom launcher, nothing happened when I tried to set a custom launcher icon. maybe the launcher icon needs to be a certain size, but I could not find that info. instead of creating a launcher with a random icon, I just stopped right there. but try this prog out, it looks promising.\n\nA: I have answered a similar question here.\nBriefly, copy the nearest script from /usr/share/applications/ to ~/.local/share/applications and then edit the xyz.desktop file. The line that starts Exec= is the line you need to edit, to put your own command in, along with whatever command line options you want. You will probably also want to edit the Name= line to describe your own script.\nOnce you've done that you'll need to restart your computer or log out/log in, then you can hit the Super key, start typing part of the name you set and your launcher should appear. Select it and hit Enter and it will run your command.\n\nA: Maybe you are looking for this command:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\n\nGood Luck!\n\nA: The .desktop files unity uses are stored in \"/usr/share/applications/\"\nYou can either (1) edit the files there, or (2) make copies of them and then add them to the unity launcher by dragging them.\n(1) makes the changes global, aka. unity will use any command line parameters you add from wherever you launch them.\n(2) will obviously not change how unity handles the application by default.  useful if you want a custom launcher to run an application in say debug mode, but don't want it to always be run in debug mode.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why can't I connect to unsecure open wireless networks?

Linux newbie here. I've been trying to use Ubuntu (x64) as my main OS since 11.10, but my wireless connection on it has been very unstable, droping every other 5-10 mins. For this reason I see myself forced to use Windows 7 (dual booting), where connection works flawlessly -- which really bothers me.\nMy card is an Atheros 9k, which claims a reasonable amount of wireless complaints on Ubuntu forums. I've tried every suggestion given on past questions to this site but to no avail. However, while running Ubuntu Live USB for some of the tests, I noticed that my wireless connection never failed on it and wondered if its network configuration differs from the one on the default Ubuntu install. If this is the case, how could I reproduce the Live USB network environment on my hard drive install?\n\nA: Turns out that, after a long struggle with Ubuntu over my internet connection, I found that switching from Unity to Gnome 3 solved the issue. I guess both interfaces use different network managers and Gnome's one keeps connection stable.\nI mark this answer as accepted since it eliminates the issue. If a more precise/detailed one comes up (i.e. instructions to install Gnome's network manager into Unity) from a more experienced user, I'll choose it.\n\nA: Linux newbie here too. In my option, if you install ubuntu to your hard disk, the possible thing may affect is the upgrade of the kernel, since you may upgrade routinely, the newest kernel may somewhat has issues. \nUsing Live CD, ubuntu use the default released kernel, which in your case may act good performance to your wireless network card. For further investigation, the best way is to re-compile or add the best responding module of your wireless adapter in, which may out of my knowledge :D\nIn general, if you feel it's stable to use the kernel shipped with the Live CD/USB, just copy them out and replace the kernel on your hard disk (in /boot folder).\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: git ssh :Permission denied (publickey) I tried to use github so I followed the help doc.

If not see here.\nTaken from github:\n\nThis problem can also be caused when ssh cannot find your keys. Make sure your key is in the default location, ~/.ssh. If you run ssh-keygen again and just press enter at all 3 prompts it will be placed here automatically. Then you can add the contents of id_rsa.pub to your account. If id_rsa.pub doesn’t work try id_dsa.pub. You might need to generate a new dsa key with ssh-keygen -t dsa if you just have an rsa key.\n\nP.S. Also sometimes the URL is typed wrong. URLs are case sensitive. Make sure to type them properly.\n\nSee this also.\n\nA: Searching google for \"Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.\" suggests that logging out of your current session and then back in, or using ssh-add should solve the problem\nRationale: Ubuntu uses ssh-agent program:\n ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication (RSA, DSA, ECDSA).  The idea\n is that ssh-agent is started in the beginning of an X-session or a login session, and all other windows or\n programs are started as clients to the ssh-agent program.  Through use of environment variables the agent can\n be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using ssh(1).\n\nIf you just generated a key, ssh-agent does not know about it so it can't sign using the key - exactly what the error message says.\nTo add the key, you either need to restart ssh-agent (i.e. log out and log back in) or to use ssh-add to re-scan the keys.\nSee man ssh-add and man ssh-agent for more info \n\nA: Use github-keygen for your SSH setup for Github: easy, powerful, safe and secure (more secure than what the official documentation recommends).\nDisclaimer: I'm the author of this tool.\n", "Q: How to remap Super (left) key to Control key Could anyone please tell me how to remap my Super (left) key to Ctrl key?\nI mean Super (left) should work as Ctrl key.\n\nA: On Ubuntu, you can edit /etc/default/keyboard and set:\nXKBOPTIONS=\"altwin:ctrl_win\"\nWhich:\n\nCtrl is mapped to Win keys (and the usual Ctrl keys)\n\nRead man 5 keyboard for more information. You can find all possible combinations of options on your system by doing:\ngrep alt /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst | grep win\n\n\nA: To make major changes to your keyboard, including remapping characters and changing modifiers, you need to use the xmodmap utility - see man xmodmap. There are a couple ways to execute the changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*either from the command line\nxmodmap -e \"your commands\"\n\n\n*or write the commands to a file like .xmodmaprc, then execute it in your login items or your .bashrc with\nxmodmap .xmodmaprc\n\nIf you name the file ~/.xmodmap it will be executed automatically on login.\nNow the commands\nWhat you want to do is a two-step process. First you unmap Super from its modifier, then you map it to control.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run xmodmap -pm in a terminal window to get a list of the bound modifiers. On my machine (and presumably yours) Super is referred to as mod4. Super_L and Super_R are separate keys which output the same modifier.\nNow you can unmap the modifier from it. Run the xmodmap command (using one of the methods above)\nremove mod4 = Super_L\n\nNow the physical key is still referred to internally as Super_L, but it doesn't do anything.\n\n*Now just remap it. Run the xmodmap command:\nadd control = Super_L\n\nIf you want to undo this later on, just run the same commands with the appropriate arguments.\nNo Super_R?\nThe output of xmodmap -pm might given you several keys named Super_L but none named Super_R). If it did, you now have several extra keys assigned to Control, but none assigned to Super. You'll have to rename one key. (NB: it might give you several Super_L and at least one Super_R. This is fine.)\nThe key names in the table all have a hex number in parentheses next to them. This number is the physical keycode of the key on your keyboard (it can vary by model). If you need to change one Super_L to Super_R, first find the keycode you want to be associated to Super_R (aren't sure which is the correct one? Run xev then tap the right Super a couple times. Somewhere in the maze of output is \"keycode = 133\" (with a different number)). Run the xmodmap command\nkeycode 133 = Super_R\n\nto rename the key, then\nadd mod4 = Super_R\n\nto assign it to Super. \n\nA: Try with this:\nclear Control\nclear mod4\nremove Control = Control_L Control_R\nremove mod4 = Super_L Super_R\nadd Control = Super_L\n\nPut the above lines in your ~/.Xmodmap and execute xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap.\n\nA: Command line:\nxmodmap -e \"remove mod4 = Super_L\"\nxmodmap -e \"add control = Super_L\"\n\nOr put in ~/.Xmodmap to activate on startup:\nremove mod4 = Super_L\nadd control = Super_L\n\n\nA: If you want to do with with a GUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install/open Gnome Tweaks\n\n*Click Keyboard & Mouse\n\n*Click Additional Layout Options\n\n*Expand Ctrl position\n\n*Select Swap Left Win with Left Ctrl\n\nA: Simple and clear example of swapping Ctrl and Alt\nCreate a file at ~/.Xmodmap.

Prism is a simple XULRunner-based browser which hosts web applications without the full browser interface. It seems as if Firefox Prism was removed from the repos since 10.04; there is no package for Natty (11.04), Oneiric (11.10) or Precise (12.04), only for the LTS versions Hardy (8.04) and Lucid (10.04).\nPeople are writing about incompatibility issues with newer Firefox versions, but I'm still using Prism without problems on Maverick (10.10, no updates anymore) with the newest Firefox from the PPA.\nIs there any reason why Prism was removed? Is there any reason I sould not use it and not install it manually? Is there something better or some alternative for >=12.04?\nI know it is possible to create a menu entry (a .destkop file) which points to firefox http://someurl.com/, but I'd like also to keep the histories, cache, cookies etc. separted. In additon I find it nice that prism comes with a simplified interface without address bar and so on.\n\nA: Easy solution\nClose all Firefox windows (also this one!). Run firefox -ProfileManager and add a new profile for your web application. You can then remove the tab bar in the preferences and all other disturbing GUI elements. Close everything and run the profile manager again to select your default profile this time. Now Firefox should start your default profile if you untick \"ask everytime\".\nThen create a file my_webapplication.desktop and create a launcher. This is an example for the Google calendar:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Google Calendar\nExec=firefox -P gcalendar -no-remote\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=firefox\n\nThe icon should be better not firefox, but a path to a icon of your choice.\ngcalendar is the profile name I chose before.\nImprovement\nIf your application is already open, opening this launcher again will result in an error. You can install wmctrl and use this small script to run your web application:\n# Is there any window with Google Calendar in the title?\nif [ -z \"`wmctrl -l|grep 'Google Calendar'`\" ]; then\n  # No --> run it\n  firefox -P gcalendar -no-remote;\nelse\n  # Yes --> change focus to this window\n  wmctrl -a 'Google Calendar';\nfi\n\nUse Chromium\nWell... I ḱind of gave up. Chromium is the easiest solution. Just click \"Create application shortcut...\" (in \"Tools\") and you're done. You'll find a *.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications which can be customized.\nYou might want to customize the *.desktop file. E.g. docky does not recognize a Chromium web application as a different application, so the Chromium icon is displayed instead. You can change this behaviour using the WMClass as described here. But you will have to add also a parameter --class=MyArbitraryChromiumAppname as discussed in this bug report. If you want to run Google Calendar your *.desktop file in .local/share/applications/ should look like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Google Calendar\nExec=/usr/bin/chromium-browser \"--app=https://www.google.com/calendar/render?gsessionid=HERE_GOES_THE_SESSION_ID_CREATED_AUTOMATICALLY\" --class=gcal\nTerminal=false\nX-MultipleArgs=false\nType=Application\nIcon=/home/peter/.icons/google_calendar.png\nCategories=Network;WebBrowser;\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=gcal\n\nNote: you have to add --class=gcal and set the property StartupWMClass=gcal (you can choose any name instead of gcal).\n\nA: \nIs there any reason why prism was removed?\n\nBecause Mozilla discontinued Prism development more than one year ago, in February 2011.\n\nIs there something better or some alternative for >=12.04?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Prism was \"forked\" by a third-party developer as Webrunner, but the fork has also now been discontinued and is no longer available for download.\n\n*Chromeless, Mozilla's continuation of the Prism philosophy, unfortunately appears to be orphaned and dead as of May 2012.\n\nIs there any reason I should not use it and not install it manually?\n\nNo, it should be safe to install manually and use provided you can satisfy all the dependencies.\nWeb application support in Firefox is currently in progress:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744193\n", "Q: In 12.04 clicking on the launcher icon does not show expo mode for multiple windows I am running Ubuntu 12.04 64bit on my machine and something changed recently, and I am not able to bring up the \"expo mode\" for all windows when clicking on the launcher icon.\nWhen clicking twice on a launcher icon for an application that has multiple windows open, unity should show all the open windows right?

However I could not figure it out. Could you please help me?\nThanks.\n\nA: As a rule if you wanna send something to the remote server via scp:\nscp some_files.tar user@remoteHost:\nscp some_files.tar user@remoteHost:Documents/newname.tar\n\nBut if you wanna download something:\nscp user@remoteHost:Documents/foo.tar ~/Desktop\nscp user@remoteHost:/any/other/dir/foo.tar .\n\n\nA: From the scp man page:\n\n -3      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local\n         host.  Without this option the data is copied directly between\n         the two remote hosts.  Note that this option disables the\n         progress meter.\n\n\nI'd suggest that the problem is that your machine embserv cannot \"see\" your other machine serhan-Lenovo-B560, or, if it can, it can't resolve the name.\nWhen you invoke scp with two remote machines, what it actually tries to do is something like this:\nssh canserhan@embserv \"scp ~/tar_files/rtl_archive.tar serhan@serhan-Lenovo-B560:~Documents$\"\n\nThat's a Good Thing as it means the copy will be more efficient, but it requires that scp from machine A to machine B works, which it won't always.\nIf that is the problem, you can solve it by using -3, or by passing the numeric IP address of serhan-Lenovo-B560 (if the name is the problem), or by fixing your ssh setup on embserv so that it can reach serhan-Lenovo-B560.\nEDIT:\nSo, try this:\nscp canserhan@embserv:~/tar_files/rtl_archive.tar serhan@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:~Documents$\n\nwhere xxx.xxx.xxx.xx is your server's IP address.\nor, if that fails, this should definitely work, but will run more slowly:\nscp -3 canserhan@embserv:~/tar_files/rtl_archive.tar serhan@serhan-Lenovo-B560:~Documents$\n\nBy the way, ~Documents$ also looks wrong. Are you sure it shouldn't be ~/Documents ?\n\nA: Try the command:\nscp ~/tar_files/rtl_archive.tar serhan@serhan-Lenovo-B560:~/Documents/\n\nembserv is your local machine. If you write scp server1:/path/to/file server2:/path/to/second/file this instructs scp to copy a file from one server to a second server.

Since upgrading to 12.04, I have found and solved some interesting problems. Given my complete lack of Ubuntu knowledge, this has indeed made me feel more than a little cocky. However, the one (!) thing I cannot figure out is the whole Dual Monitor setup.\nAnyway, the blah bit... Fujitsu Siemens Amilo 3530, ATI Radeon 3200 HD Series, 4GB RAM 1TB HDD and so on, generic HDMI monitor. Got the GNOME fglrx loaded with the kosher latest ATI driver (but not the post update one, that one just will not activate)\nNow, in 11.10, it just wouldn't work, at all, not even when tempted with tasty treats and promises of great pleasure. Still, I persisted and, when I noticed the 2nd Monitor working with the 12.04 Try Out DVD, I went for it.\nAfter getting 12.04 running, the HDMI still shows nothing but blue screen on the telly, telling me 'No Signal\".

Under Configurations > Basic Settings you'll find the instructions to:\nsudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/default /etc/apache2/sites-available/mynewsite\n\nand then edit several files to get that site up and running. In other words, use the default Apache site configuration to create one for each site you want to host, then tweak that file to specify all the needed directives(ServerAdmin, ServerName, Listen ports, etc.) for mynewsite.\nThe guide is very well done, and if you take you time and work through it step-by-step, you should be up and running with multiple sites fairly soon.\nP.S. - Hopefully it goes without saying, but please replace mynewsite with the actual name of the site you want to use.\n\nA: I've also had issues when adding new sites to 127.0.0.1 where all the config files were setup correctly and the cache cleared but one of the new sites was not working.

I enabled Hardware Virtualization(VT-d).\nmy pc configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel® Core™ i3 CPU 540 @ 3.07GHz × 4 \n\n*4GB DDR3 RAM\n\n\nA: Virtualbox supports your configuration (64-bit guest on 32-bit host), but there are some requirements and other caveats:\nFrom the manual:\nVirtualBox supports 64-bit guest operating systems, even on 32-bit host operating systems, provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support (see the section called “Hardware vs. software virtualization”).\n\n*You must enable hardware virtualization for the particular VM for which you want 64-bit support; software virtualization is not supported for 64-bit VMs.\n\n*If you want to use 64-bit guest support on a 32-bit host operating system, you must also select a 64-bit operating system for the particular VM. Since supporting 64 bits on 32-bit hosts incurs additional overhead, VirtualBox only enables this support upon explicit request.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Warning:\n  \n*On any host, you should enable the I/O APIC for virtual machines that you intend to use in 64-bit mode. This is especially true for 64-bit Windows VMs. See the section called “\"Advanced\" tab”. In addition, for 64-bit Windows guests, you should make sure that the VM uses the Intel networking device, since there is no 64-bit driver support for the AMD PCNet card; see the section called “Virtual networking hardware”.\n\n\nPlease ensure you are meeting all these requirements, and that your memory allocation is reasonable -- try 512MB only for Backtrack to start with.\nThe other option is to try the free VMWare Player instead, which also supports this configuration, and see if it works any better.\nFinally, even though you have 4GB RAM, if you can, you should just upgrade your physical machine to 64-bit 11.10 or 12.04. There should be no performance penalties with your configuration.\n\nA: If backtrack 32-bit worked fine, why not just use that? I don't think backtrack 64-bit has many differences apart from the obvious.\n", "Q: How do I stop Remmina nagging about rdp certficate validation?

The USB mouse and keyboard both work immediately at power up and in the BIOS, but then stop working as soon as GRUB starts up.

I installed all the updates as well but didn't install the fglrx drivers.  Seemed like it was working fine.\nI suspended the laptop.  Whoops, now it's a brick.  No key, mouse button, or power button would resume it.  The fan was still running and both power LEDs were on (one indicating the laptop is plugged in, one indicating it's powered on).\nI held down the power button for 8s to force it to power off.  Fan goes off, HD spins down, power light goes out, all as expected.\nWhen I hit the power button to turn it back on, fan comes on, HD spins up, but it doesn't show the BIOS splash screen or anything -- just a totally black screen, like before I powered it off.\nEdit: I removed the battery for a while and now it boots normally.  Should I just disable suspend or is there a way around this?\nEdit2: I tried sudo pm-hibernate -- it didn't shut down the laptop but after forcing power off and powering back on it resumed just fine.\n\nA: I have the same problem, but essentially it only kills the screen.\nYou can check yourself: type \"sudo pm-suspend\" from the prompt. i assume it works (here it works). this is the same command as called when you close your lid.\nNow open a terminal and already type \"sudo pm-suspend\". do not press enter.\nnow close the lid. your computer becomes what you call \"a brick\". \nnow press enter (which will execute the command you just typed in the command line). maybe you also need to type your root password followed by another enter.\nvoila, your computer went into suspend and resumes when you open the lid.\n\nA: Removing and replacing the battery un-bricks the laptop, so that's a workaround at least.

When I used them it shows an indication on the screen that the volume is being changed, but the volume is not changing at all (same thing with the mute key).\nThe weird thing is that when I go from xfce to ubuntu the keys are now working fine.\nI don't know if this matters but I have a sound card in my computer.\nHow can I make the volume keys work in xfce?\n\nA: xfce4-volumed only works for me when it is not running in daemon mode.  The volume keys work for me when I run this command to kill any existing volumed processes and start a new one that is not running in daemon mode:\nkill `pidof xfce4-volumed` ; mkdir -p /tmp/volumed && cd /tmp/volumed && nohup xfce4-volumed --no-daemon &\n\nThis runs the process using nohup, so the terminal in which you run this command can be closed without killing the process.\n\nA: Those volume keys are gnome based... Or unity based or whatever... You have to create a custom keyboard shortcuts in the keyboard settings gui to reduce, increase and mute volume...\nFor volume increase, the command is \"amixer set master 5%+\"\nfor volume decrease \"amixer set master 5%-\"\nfor mute \"amixer set master toggle\"\n\nA: This is still broken in 12.10. You can fix it by installing xfce4-mixer and then manually selecting the mixers to control with it - and then going into the xfce4 settings editor and typing in the name of the \"active card\". The mute button still won't work properly, you can mute but not unmute the sound with it. Everything else works though, including on screen notifications. It's really tricky to get it all working, so I opened a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-mixer/+bug/1085752\nIn detail, in xfce4-mixer you want it to look something like this:\n\nThis should show only the primary volume control of your sound card. You have to choose a sound card at the top and then click \"Select Controls...\" to add controls.\nThen in the xfce4-settings-editor you need to set the \"active-card\" like this:\n\nUnder \"sound-cards\" you'll see a list of every sound card for which you added mixers. You will probably have multiple cards so it might take some trial and error here to find the right one. You need to copy the name of the correct card from \"sound-cards\" to \"active-card\" - this will be the mixer which the volume buttons control.\n\nA: I had the same problem in Xubuntu 12.04, though I don't know if it would have worked in Unity, since I only have Xfce4. In terminal, type:\n$ xfconf-query -c xfce4-mixer -p /active-card -s xfconf-query -c xfce4-mixer -p /sound-card\n\nSource: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xfce#Xfce4-volumed\n\nA: If this is a temporary problem, like it was in my case, just do it in command line:\nkillall xfce4-volumed && xfce4-volumed\n\nA: I fixed the problem changing the \"Active Card\" parameter in the xfce4-settings-editor\nI have two sound card (one HDMI and the other a normal one) and the selected card was different from the normal card that I was using.\n\nA: I had this very odd problem as well, I could adjust the volume slider in the menu and it would do nothing. Also, if I tried adjusting it with my keyboard, the slider would move but nothing would change with the actual volume.\nI fixed it by going to PulseAudio Volumne Control. In the Output Devices panel, you can see all of your sound card options. From there, I made sure the port was set to Analog Output. In your case it might be HDMI or headphones depending on where you want your sound to go. Then select the 'set as fallback option'. It looks like a green check mark.\nI didn't have to install xfce4-mixer to get this to work.\n\nA: In Settings > Settings Manager > Keyboard > Applications Shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*add amixer set Master 3+ to increase volume\n\n*add amixer set Master 3- to decrease volume\n\n*add amixer -D pulse set Master Playback Switch toggle to mute/unmute sound\n\n\nA: I met similar problem, and managed to solved it.\nI realize in my Ubuntu Studio 18.10 XFCE4, the startup application included XFCE Volume Daemon, which when I disabled it, reboot, and installed xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin, it'll then works as intended.\nHope it helps others out there.\n", "Q: \"Empty Partition!\" in Mac after created that with Disk Utility I just got a new hard drive yesterday, 2TB, and copied across all the files I needed, into two partitions in the new 2TB Disk, that I created in Disk Utility (command palimpsest). One was 500GB and the other was 1TB. They were both FAT32, as they needed to be read by Linux, MacOSX and Windows. So I transferred data to the partitions respectively, and when I plugged the hard drive into the Mac Machine, it just said there was nothing there at all. Back to the Ubuntu machine, and I looked around in Disk Utility to see that the type was FAT32, but the partition type was showing Empty(0x00) .\nTried to change it in the Edit partition Button but no avail. Gparted also doesn't recognize them either. I cannot mount and view the files and I Don't want to wipe it and start again, as it took over 7 hours to transfer the data.\nAnyone got any ideas?\n\nA: FAT32 file system has size limitations. You cannot create a FAT32 partition greater than 32 gigabytes (GB). In addition, you cannot store a file larger than 4 GB on a FAT32 partition.\nSource: Microsoft \nCheck here for more info\nBeyond 32GB\nDespite FAT32’s shortcomings in terms of maximum file size limits, lack of ACLs, and disk quotas support. Unfortunately, when the user wants to prepare a drive for use in this fashion, there is one major problem: Windows cannot format drives and partitions larger than 32GB in FAT32.\nYou may even consider making a partition sized at 32GB initially and then resizing it to fill the rest of the empty space. But within Windows, using the basic storage tools to resize operations is not supported on file systems other than NTFS.1 \n1Source:techrepublic.com\n", "Q: How do I move the MySQL data directory?

So then I can just log out, mess up my other user, and easily go back to my regular desktop, when the computer shutdown(or crashes) it logs in to my normal desktop!\n", "Q: How can I automount my ecryptfs ~/.private directory without logging in? On Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS, ecryptfs is set up where my /home/user/.private directory becomes decrypted when I login. I can then access my files in /home/user/private.\nBut if I don't login to the server, but I access the server in Nautilus from Ubuntu Desktop using SSH, the Private folder is still encrypted so I can't view the files.\nIs there a way so when SSHFS is used via Nautilus and the SSH share is mounted, the server will decrypt the .private directory?\nOr, can it always be decrypted as long as the server is turned on? I'm only interested in the encryption if the server is off (i.e, HDD stolen).\n\nA: It's essential that you login at least once, and provide the login passphrase to the system at least once per boot, to mount your encrypted data.  By default, pam_ecryptfs will unmount your data on logout.\nThe best way to achieve the functionality you want, while still having some measurable amount of security, is to simply remove the automatic unmount flag, which is enabled by default.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to the server system, and: rm ~/.ecryptfs/auto-umount\n\n*Once per system boot, you'll need to logon to the server and provide your login passphrase.  After that, you can logout and use Gnautilus + sshfs and read/write your encrypted data.\n\n", "Q: How to config multiple monitor with optimus?

This was a fresh install replacing 10.10 with the new 12.04.  I use an external monitor plugged in via VGA because the screen on the laptop is broken so badly that it cannot be read.  All went fine during installation, but upon reboot the fresh install does not recognize the external monitor.  Naturally I am able to log in by just hitting the Enter key and inputting my password and hitting enter again.  I tried this, hoping it would see the external monitor after login.  It did not.  I can tell it logged in properly because the broken laptop screen changed colors.  I'm sure I could edit a config file or something but this is difficult to do on a laptop without a working screen.  As I write this, I am reinstalling with the \"download updates\" option selected in hopes that this may fix the issue.  I would rather just be able to change monitors with a keyboard shortcut but I don't think this is possible.  I did not have any such problems with the old 10.10 installation.  Any help resolving this issue is appreciated.\n\nA: I think you are on the right track with editing the xorg.conf file that you posted not long after this one. I suspect the reason you didn't have this issue in 10.10 was rooted in how Xorg auto-configs. xorg.conf is now only really necessary if you have special circumstances like a broken monitor. :-)\n", "Q: How does one open the HUD from the command line. Alt is used to open the HUD in 12.04. \nI'd like to use alt to execute a second action as well as open the HUD by having alt execute an executable script. \nSo Alt = script, that does HUD and other stuff. \nI know how to do all of this except call the HUD from the command line.\n\nA: The HUD service is available as a service on DBus, so if you'd just like to poll it for information you can do that with a gdbus command, like this.\ngdbus call --session --dest com.canonical.hud --object-path /com/canonical/hud --method com.canonical.hud.StartQuery \"my query\" 5\n\nIf you're trying to get Unity to show the HUD prompt you can do that with the XTest extension using xdotool like this:\nxdotool key alt\n\nIf you're interested in playing with HUD it's probably best to use the hud-gtk tool which is in the indicator-appmenu-tools package.\n\nA: You can query the hud from the command line using hud-cli, but it doesn't actually raise the Unity side of hud and it doesn't let you activate the results.  It's really only useful for testing hud searches.\nI don't think there is a way to do what you are describing at this time.\n", "Q: Android device not recognized in eclipse I tried to plug my Samsung Galaxy S to my Ubuntu box for developing applications in Android, but the problem is that lsusb doesn't recognize the device.\nI tried with a friend smartphone and it is recognized, but mine is not.\nAny idea?\n\nA: A quick search on the web reveals that you have to activate debugging on the phone first.\n", "Q: Wireless roaming aggressiveness I was wondering if there was anyway to change the aggressiveness of wireless roaming between access points of the same SSID in ubuntu like there is in windows, I often times find that when I walk downstairs in my house that I have an awful wireless signal even though I'm basically next to an access point, so I have a feeling that its not switching access points when I move. I am running ubuntu 12.04 right now.\n\nA: My understanding is that the sensitivity to Access Point roaming, can be setup using iwconfig;\niwconfig wlan0 sens <value>\n\nOn modern cards, this parameter usually controls handover/roaming threshold,  the  lowest  signal  level  for  which  the hardware remains associated with  the  current  Access  Point.  When  the signal  level  goes below this threshold the card starts looking for a new/better Access Point. e.g.\niwconfig wlan0 sens -80\niwconfig wlan0 sens 2\n\n(reference manual)\n\nA: So I was wondering how you would get the currently set value.\nI don't know if it is part of iwconfig output or some other command.

This machine used to run Ubuntu 10.10 and I have to use an external monitor as the internal screen on the laptop is broken and cannot be read.  Using the LiveCD to install 12.04 and erase the previous 10.10 installation, all worked fine while installing from the live CD and the external monitor was detected and could be used.  After finishing the install, and rebooting, the laptop will not recognize the external monitor and since the internal screen is unusable I cannot configure displays as one normally would.  I think I may be able to alter my /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to use the external monitor instead of the default device, but I am unsure of what to change in the file.  My /etc/X11/xorg.conf file looks like this:\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier         \"Default Device\"\n        Option \"NoLogo\"            \"True\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: Install the proprietary driver will still using the Live CD (should work if you have enough ram) this will install nvidia-xconfig which you will need to run as root so type the following:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig -o ./xorg.conf \nThis will give you a more detailed xorg.conf file that should have both the broken and working monitor listed.  \nBelow is what it added on my system.

I have got a Dell Inspiron N5110 running Ubuntu 12.04. It has two graphic cards, Integrated Intel graphics And Nvidia. I was wondering if there is a way to switch between graphic cards. As the Nvidia card is using a lot off battery power I want the Intel card to be the default.\n\nA: Is it one of their Optimus cards? That's what I have, and I use Ironhide to switch between cards. My laptop uses the Intel card most of the time, but when I need more power I run the application through optirun <command>.\n", "Q: How to make package manager recognize libs that were compiled manually? I had to compile OpenCV 2.4 on my machine. How to make applications installed from synaptic do not ask to install OpenCV 2.3 libs dependencies (since 2.4 is already installed in the system)?\n\nA: The answer is simple (but it is more complicated to follow it): \nyou have to create a debian package of the code you compiled (OpenCV 2.4) and install that package. This way the package manager knows that the package exists. \nGuides on how to create a package are:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/tools/packaging/\nThere also seems to be a fake version of the above: create a package that pretends to be OpenCV 2.4 and install this package.

I already installed Ubuntu 12.04 in my MacBook Pro, And everything worked alright except for the WiFi (it said something about the firmware) and because I'm new in this I couldn't fix it, So my question is:\nWhat version of Ubuntu works fine (with the wifi working) \"out of the box\" in MacBooks? \nI already tried to install Ubuntu 11.10 but I couldn't.\n\nA: Most times, newer Ubuntu releases have better hardware support then olders. Especially on MAcBook i would always recommend you to install the latest (lts) version.\nAre you able to connect your MacBook to Ethernet while installing? This could help you download drivers for your Wifi which might not be included on the cd. As #blade19899 wrote, you should use the amd+mac64 install iso.\nIt is possible that you do not have to reinstall: Connect you MacBook to the internet with a Ethernet and then type „Additional Drivers“ into the dash. There might be drivers available to install for your Wifi card.\n\nA: The version you want is... 12.04.  That is the version that has most things working \"out of the box\" for Macs.  Unfortunately things will be different from one variation of Macbook to the next and no version ever has everything actually working for Macs.  11.10 and prior releases are known to have a LOT of stuff broken for MacBooks with the initial installation.  Most, but not all, of the fixes are unnecessary now with 12.04.\nIt is very important to know the exact model of MacBook Pro, e.g. MacBook Pro 8,1.  I would then search the Ubuntu forums for it.\n\nA: I run Ubuntu 12.04 on my Macbook Pro 8.1. Everything works out of the box, except wireless. To get that working, I use the following script:\nhttp://pastebin.com/TyPB9sEh\n\nA: Hope this link from Ubuntu will help you\n", "Q: setsid by default in Terminal So I've just discovered the command setsid, which makes life a whole lot easier for running programs from Terminal. What I'd like to know is if there's a way to set programs to launch in a new session automatically, because honestly I'm probably going to be prepending setsid before everything I run now. Is this bad practice for some reason?\n\nA: Apart from creating aliases for your programs, it's not really possible to have setsid automatically prefixed before every command typed in the terminal. However, I find it is very useful to create an .inputrc in your home folder and place in it (observing the quoting): \nControl-o: \"setsid \"\n\nYou can now hit Ctrl+o in the terminal and then type your command; it saves a lot of time if you need to keep repeating it. There is no error in the placement of quotes: it allows you to immediately type a command after the shortcut is used. This functionality and much more is provided by bash's readline library: see man bash or the Ubuntu manpages online. \nWith reference to your second question, it isn't bad practice to use setsid a lot and just depends on your particular needs. In fact it is extremely useful, because, as noted at kernel.org,\n\nsetsid creates a new session if the calling process is not a process group\n         leader.  The calling process is the leader of the new session, the process\n         group leader of the new process group, and has no controlling tty...The calling process will be the only process in this new\n         process group and in this new session.\n\nHence the program launched with setsid has complete independence from the terminal from which it was started, as a new process has been forked. \nThere are also other similar, but different ways of detaching a program from the terminal such as nohup or disown. (It should be said that setsid is a program from the util-linux package, while disown is a bash builtin.)  This question may be of great interest, as it touches upon such related topics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running programs in the background from terminal\n", "Q: How to create a \"shutdown user\" or \"shutdown account\" Red Hat had a feature useful to me at the present time. There was an account, generally called \"shutdown\", and when you logged in with the account, the system shut down.\nIn my specific case, I have Ubuntu Server running in a VM on my local system. The VM is running a web app, and when I'm done doing work, I want to shut down the VM. Unfortunately, I can't install VMware tools to get the \"power button\" based shutdown. Currently I login then sudo shutdown -h now, then type my password again, and things shutdown. Really, it's getting annoying all that waiting around and typing things.\nHow do I replicate the \"shutdown account\" functionality in Ubuntu?\nA related question, were there any security gotchas that motivated people to stop using this kind of account?\n\nA: I came to the same conclusion as reverendj1.

You gave us some information about your computer, but you did not tell us the make and model of your graphics card. You should edit your question to include that. If you end up reporting a bug, you should make sure to include that information in the bug report as well.\nYou should MD5 test the Ubuntu .iso you downloaded. If that fails, it means the .iso file is corrupted, so you'll need to download it again and start over.\nIf that succeeds, then verify the installation media (whether it's a CD/DVD or USB flash drive). You can use these instructions.\nIf no errors are found, then try using the nomodeset kernel boot option. That can work around some graphics card problems. If that does the trick, you can set nomodeset permanently (also using the instructions available through that link).\n\nA: I've had a similar issue and it seems that it is related to the Nvidia card used. I have found the following workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the USB stick/CD disk and, as soon as you see a small icon at the bottom of the screen, press Enter.\n\n*Choose your language\n\n*Press F6 (More options).\n\n*Select \"nomodeset\" and press Enter (an \"x\" will appear next to this option).\n\n*Choose \"Install Ubuntu\" and follow the usual instalation process.\n\n\nThe install screens will appear with low quality, when once Ubuntu is fully installed, the screen will appear OK.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Same Thing.  It could be that your ACPI is not supported.\nDisable the new card , or disable ACPI.

I get that there are multiple distributions, that use different kernel versions. But there has to be ways. I never understood why it's never a main target for big titles. \n\nA: Video games are not developed due to the lack of market share. A majority of users are on OS X or Windows systems. The kernel version has nothing to do with it as it is largely the same system after a kernel update. Windows runs has the NT kernel which has different versions, yet it still can run the same games on different versions.\nNow that Linux is popularizing games are being made for it. Steam is reportedly coming to Linux, which will probably increase the amount of games developed for the platform.\n\nA: Very few Linux users + companies need to spend some time and money to make a crossplatform game => it is not profitable.\nAlso, companies need to test their games on every more or less popular distribution (and several versions of each distro), regardless of the fact that usually different distributions are compatible with each other.\n\nA: Well,\nThe reason is mentioned cost. However some independent studios work on it, and lately EA decided to start creating games for Linux also, what is a huge step forward for us. For example one of my favourites games ever - Penumbra  is also developed for Linux.\nOn the other hand I am working with few of my friends on a two (open source) full free games by default for Ubuntu only. Point&Click and 3rd person Shooter/Adventure game. However, as I do other things for living the work progress is slow. Programming (with Blender or Panda3D) is a piece of cake, creating, characters etc. is much harder as it requires a lot of time and effort.\nI think the main problem with games for Linux is that Linux community creates mostly applications which are really necessary, and games, are not. What the Community needs in my opinion is a well organized people who will create games for Linux. Just like Canonical creates Ubuntu, Oracle makes Virtual box, Libre Office foundation and so on.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't save my settings for thinkpad trackpoint I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a Thinkpad X200. To configure the trackpoint, I use \"configure TrackPoint\". Unfortunately I can't make Ubuntu saving my settings (concerning the sensitivity etc.). Whenever I reboot the computer, it's set to generic settings again. \nI already tried htorque's answer to a similar question and created a new udev-rule for the trackpoint-settings but it didn't helped.\nSo, how can I make theses settings permanent?\n\nA: I finally found a working solution:\n1. Find the device path of your trackpoint\nRun the following in a gnome-terminal (can be opened with Ctrl+Alt+t):\nfind /sys/devices/platform/i8042 -name name | xargs grep -Fl TrackPoint | sed 's/\\/input\\/input[0-9]*\\/name$//'\n\nIt will return something like\n/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2\n\nchange to whatever it returns for you in the following step.\n2. Create a new upstart-job\nStill in the terminal type:\nsudo gedit /etc/init/trackpoint.conf\n\nA text editor will pop up. Paste the following code in it:\ndescription \"Trackpoint-Settings\"\nenv TPDIR=/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2\nstart on virtual-filesystems\nscript\n  while [ ! -f $TPDIR/sensitivity ]; do\n        sleep 2\n  done\n  echo -n 200 > $TPDIR/sensitivity\n  echo -n 150 > $TPDIR/speed\n  echo -n 1 > $TPDIR/press_to_select\nend script\n\nDon' forget to edit the second line if needed (see step 1).\nYou can edit the numbers in line eight and nine (representing sensitivity and speed) to whatever you prefer. Both can be set in a range from 0 to 255. Leaving them at 200 and 150 works good for me.\nSave and exit.\nThat's it.\n", "Q: Once authenticated once, passwords are cached in lightdm We are preparing 12.04 LTS for our userbase and have done some basic configuration to the login screen (disabled guest account, removed user list, etc).

Those are not provided by Ubuntu as you know, since you quoted the answer from the other askubuntu question. The Ubuntu defaults are here: /usr/share/applications/defaults.list.\nSecond, there is a good reason to have different applications for different video types: some players can not play all types, but still be the preferred application if they are able to.\nIn general, I would not advice you to edit that file, but follow one of those steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*System settings > Details > Default applications should open something like this:\n\nHere you can change the preferred applications for important summary mime types. \n\n*Use the freedesktop.org utility xdg-mime to specify an application for a specific mime type: xdg-mime default myapp.desktop mymimetype (replace myapp.desktop and mymimetype with whatever you need)\n\n*Or of cause use the right click menu from Nautilus as you already know:Nautilus->RightClick->Open with..\n", "Q: How to change harddrive spindown time? if I run my notebook on battery mode, ubuntu spindown my hardrive every few seconds.

There are 5 hard drives: one SSD with the OS and 4 HDDs (Samsung HD204UI) configured as a RAID5 using mdadm.\nI don't need the RAID very often (say, about once per day in average); it contains multimedia data and some backups, so I decided to put the drives to standby most of the time.\nI configured the drives to automatically spin-down after 20 minutes using hdparm, here /dev/sda as an example:\nhdparm -S 240 /dev/sda\n\nThe output of the command confirmed this:\n/dev/sdb:\n setting standby to 240 (20 minutes)\n\nBut the problem is that the drive spins down after about 5 seconds (instead 20 minutes) after the last access, and\nhdparm -C /dev/sdb\n\ndisplays:\n/dev/sdb:\n drive state is:  standby\n\nWhy doesn't the drive wait the 20 minutes as configured? Does it have something to do with the RAID setup? (I don't think so...)\nThis very short timeout is problematic since it is a RAID5 and when I access a file, it is spread block-wise around the four drives. Since drive 1 isn't needed when drive 2 is read, it went asleep when it will be used the next time (after drive 3 has been read from). So the drives keep spinning up and down the whole time resulting in a throughput near zero.\nFor the people being concerned about the life of my drives: It will be no problem that the drives are spinned up and down once a day in average since I prefer saving energy and heat over health of the drives (I use RAID5 and the content isn't very important).\n\nA: Is AHCI enabled in your BIOS? If not try turning it on and re-trying.\nIf that still doesn't work, then you may have to try something a bit more complicated, as hdparm doesn't always play nicely with SATA drives, which is what I presume you have.\nCheck out this page for the following relatively simple solution that uses crontab:\nsudo apt-get install sg3-utils\ncrontab -e\n\nNow, add this to the bottom of your crontab (replace sdx with the drive you wish to put in standby):\n0-59/15 * * * * ( if [ ! -f /dev/shm/1 ] ; then touch /dev/shm/1 /dev/shm/2; fi ; mv /dev/shm/1 /dev/shm/2; cat /proc/diskstats > /dev/shm/1 ) >/dev/null 2>&1\n0-59/15 * * * * ( export HD=\"sdx \"; if [ \"$(diff /dev/shm/1 /dev/shm/2 | grep $HD )\" =  \"\" ] ; then /usr/bin/sg_start --stop /dev/$HD; fi ) >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nOf course, before attempting any of this, it's highly advisable to perform a full backup of the contents of your hard drives.\n\nA: Maybe a better way could be:\nhdparm -B 1 -Y /dev/device\nhdparm -B 255 /dev/device  \nThe first hdparm put the device standby immediately.\nThe second one turn off APM, so the disk stay in standby mode till the next disk access.\n", "Q: Why does gwibber-service-facebook/twitter updates when I have uninstalled Gwibber?

The plugins (eg. gwibber-service-twitter etc) do not depend on it, and so may not have been removed\nYou also need to remove the gwibber-service package.  This package is responsible for the backend of Gwibber - account details, checking for new messages etc.  The plug-in packages (and the gwibber package) all depend on this.  Removing this package (eg. sudo apt-get remove gwibber-service) should prompt you that any plugin packages installed will also be removed.  Using the software centre, search for gwibber and click Show x technical items at the bottom of the search window.  gwibber-service will be listed here and may be uninstalled by clincking the Uninstall button. \n", "Q: Fail to upgrade from 11.04 to 12.04  \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I skip over releases? \n\nI tried to upgrade from 11.04 to 12.04 by Update manager, but failed.\nThe error message was:\nFailed to fetch http://kr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/t/ttf-alee/ttf-alee_12+nmu1ubuntu1_all.deb'\n\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: You can't upgrade from 11.04 to 12.04. You must upgrade to 11.10 and then to 12.04. You can only skip upgrades if you upgrade from an LTS (10.04) to a LTS (12.04). You can't skip in-between. \nI suggest you download an 11.10 image from here. And then upgrades via a usb-stick (live-cd). and then upgrades to 12.04, via the same method.  \n\nA: I fixed it.\nI guess there was a temporarily problem in accessing http://kr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/t/ttf-alee/ttf-alee_12+nmu1ubuntu1_all.deb\nI downloaded 'ttf-alee_12+nmu1ubuntu1_all.deb' from a mirror site and install it manually, then completed  the online update.\nBut now 'ttf-alee_12+nmu1ubuntu1_all.deb' is available on 'kr.archive.ubuntu.com'.

I have an old computer that can't handle a boot stick install, so i have to create an actual, old fashioned boot CD.\nHowever, the image size for Ubuntu 12.04 is 732MB, which is too large for a CD, which can hold only 700MB.\nThe maintainers of Ubuntu 12.04 say the image size will never go over 700MB, and indeed, the download size seemed to be 689MB.\nBrasero says it won't burn the CD because the file is too big, what's going on?\n\nA: I use K3B to burn ISO images.\nFor me, is better then brasero.\nTry to burn with another CD brand (Preferably do not use CD-RW )\n\nA: Are you using a 74 minute CD-R?  You need to use an 80 minute one.\n\nA: If you dig deeper, you'll stumble upon this particular URL which has the \"CD\" images. \nAll images are <= 700MB and created specifically for \"CD\"s unlike the official download link which is actually meant to be burned on a DVD. Hope this helps if anyone is still looking for answers to this question.\n\nA: Try downloading it from the alternative link at the Ubuntu website (the torrent one). It's about 695MB (AMD64), and the Intel one is 687MB.\n\nA: If you're trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal), it is too big for CD now, so you need to use USB or DVD install options. \n\nA: The compressed CDs website has a unique compression method, unlike any other solution shown here. The superior compression method fits all of a 12.04 or 13.10 distro onto a CD, not a truncated distro, but the complete real deal.\n\nA: Brasero (on Debian and Ubuntu), has varying levels of reliability because of its depending (via brasero-cdrkit) on the controversial wodim (which is a fork of cdrtools). According to the original author of cdrtools, the wodim fork is badly broken and unmaintained BUT shipped by default in Debian/Ubuntu. See one-sided and detailed account of the controversy. So if Brasero fails for you, it might be because of this.\nTo work around the issue, you may use a lightweight alternative like Xfburn. Xfburn relies on the non-controversial libburnia libraries, so is not plagued by the same issues as Brasero.\n\nA: 702mb and 732mb is still to big for a cd right, and i'm not sure about the installation to be compatible with dvd r, the simple choices are to install it on a flash drive/USB or buy a cd brand with more than 700mb such as verbatim\n\nA: You have to follow the instructions to create an image of Ubuntu from any Ubuntu version. This is not the traditional way to burn CDs. It is different because the size of Ubuntu 12.04 is more than 700 Mb, so you must follow the instructions which are on this page. \n\nA: There are options for people in this situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*A \"700MB\" CD would be a good start. They can fit 737MB on (because the advertised number is actually a MiB) and even then there's often some overburn space.

A 1GB USB stick would be cheap and offer a reusable method for loading images.\n\n*Failing that there are smaller images (like Server, Minimal, etc) which you can install in text mode and then install the ubuntu-desktop metapackage.\n\nA: ImgBurn will overburn this file.  It's free software, very easy to use. From personal experience, I have burned 12.04 to a 700MB Memorex CD-R. This was a 741,646,232 byte file, which is 707.289 MB.

Compare to a dedicated graphics/video card which has its own onboard RAM. Even if your laptop has a dedicated ATI/NVidia card, the laptop is usually set by default to automatically \"switch\" between the two (Nvidia calls this Optimus), and that means that the integrated Intel graphics will reserve memory even if you aren't using them.\nWindows includes the reserved video RAM in its count, while Ubuntu doesn't. You can't use this reserved RAM in either OS, in any case.\nYour BIOS should let you set a specific value for the amount to be reserved, instead of automatic -- I recommend you pick at least 128MB. Then Ubuntu will show the remainder (8064 MB) as available and usable. Alternately, if you wish to only use the discrete (Nvidia/ATI) card, you can also select that as an option in the BIOS, disabling Intel graphics completely, which should give you access to all of your RAM (warning: this may decrease battery life).\n\nA: It no problem after all you are having 7.7GB Ram .. Their should not Be any performance issue.Your ram is shared with integrated graphics memory of your Processor, So don't take it seriously your PC is Fine.\n", "Q: How do I customize the NTP poll rate? I'm setting up Ubuntu on an embedded machine that runs over a cellular connection, where we pay per byte. The machine also has no RTC battery, so it starts from a random time every boot.\nI'd like to ensure that the time gets synced up when the cellular connection comes available so that log messages, etc have real times, but I also don't want to pay an arm and a leg for NTP traffic.\nCan I customize the rate at which NTP updates the time? I'm using openntpd currently, but I'm not wedded to it.\nThe internet is not necessarily up at boot, so ntupdate and related at startup won't work. And scheduling via cron means waiting for the scheduled task to kick in, whereas I want a time daemon to get a time sync ASAP.\n\nA: My experience is with ntp rather than openntpd. \nYou should know that the NTP protocol usually starts with sending packets every minute (64 seconds), but usually settles in by sending and receiving one packet every 17 minutes for each server you have in your /etc/ntp.conf file. Network outages or an unstable clock in your device may increase this, however. Each packet has a payload of about 68 bytes, so that's probably a little more than 100 bytes, each way, per poll.\nThe rdate and ntpdate at network up time are good ideas for setting the time. And if that is all you need should work well for you.\nIf you need to keep the time in sync over an extended time, however, the ntp protocol was designed to do that. The clock in your device will run a little fast or slow depending on how warm or cool it gets, even though it probably has a crystal controlled clock -- and ongoing timekeeping is meant to adjust for that.\nHere are some suggestions if you need ongoing timekeeping and wish to reduce bandwidth used. They refer to items in ntp.conf.\nDon't use iburst. (But it will take more time to set the time initially).\nIncrease minpoll upwards from 6 (2^6 seconds is 64 seconds). This reduces traffic when the protocol starts up after the network comes up.\nIncrease maxpoll upwards from 10 (2^10 seconds is 1024 seconds or about every 17 minutes. You can go as far as 17 to poll about every 36 hours. I haven't tried this myself.\nUse only a minimum number of servers, if you had one that can be reliably reached from your embedded devices, that would have been great. The more servers the more reliable the timekeeping can be, but traffic scales up, so it is a trade off.\n\nA: Some of these answers could win the obfuscated ntp configuration contest. \nUse the ntp reference implementation and use iburst to set the time quickly upon booting. After that the you can use the minpoll directive to limit how often ntpd queries remote time servers. This will allow you to take advantage of ntpd's clock disciplining and keep the bandwidth down. \nminpoll minpoll\nmaxpoll maxpoll\n    These options specify the minimum and maximum poll intervals for NTP \n    messages, in seconds as a power of two. The maximum poll interval \n    defaults to 10 (1024 s), but can be increased by the maxpoll option to \n    an upper limit of 17 (36 h). The minimum poll interval defaults to 6 (64 s), \n    but can be decreased by the minpoll option to a lower limit of 3 (8 s).\n\nChrony is a good alternative to the ntp reference implementation. Openntpd is not. \n\nA: You could do some hackery involving running ntpdate when the cell interface comes up.\nBut if you can, installing chrony would be a better alternative, as it was created with intermittent network access in mind.\n\nA: On a default install of Ubuntu, the NTP daemon doesn't run.  Instead, the time is set each time a network interface is brought up by the /etc/network/if-up.d/ntpdate hook.\nIf you are after one-off time synchronisation rather than constant synchronisation, then this might be enough for you.\nYou can control which servers are queried to set the time either through the standard /etc/ntp.conf file, or through the NTPSERVERS variable in /etc/default/ntpdate.\n\nA: You've probably already read the openntpd man page.\nhttp://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd.conf\nYou've probably already noticed the lack of a polling option for time.\nI have these possible hacks to propose:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use any ntpd just call ntpdate via cron.\n\n*Use cron and/or your cellular connection scripts to toggle iptables rules to drop or allow port 123 traffic when you want to allow it. This could be as simple as \n0 12 * * * iptables -D OUTPUT -j DROP -p udp --dport 123 # at noon start allowing ntp\n0 13 * * * iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP -p udp --dport 123 # at 1pm stop allowing ntp\n\n*Embed a radio clock receiver in your embedded machine. I know almost nothing about this but products like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.galsys.co.uk/time-receivers/ac-500-msf-time-receiver.html and this  \n\n*http://www.giangrandi.ch/electronics/dcf77/dcf77.shtml and people talking like this \n\n*http://www.blu.org/cgi-bin/calendar/2010-oct \nmake me think that it is not difficult if you can receive the radio signal. \n\nA: Do you need the exact and precise synchronization that ntp provides? If not, you might be able to get away with using rdate or ntpdate at boot and then periodically via cron.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, ntp poll interval can be set to maximum of 1024 seconds. Perhaps the simplest solution would be to run ntpdate at each boot and later every now and then from crontab.\nIf your clock starts with a random time at each boot, then you probably won't be able to run ntpd anyway and you'll have to use ntpdate first. Ntpd refuses to sync time if the difference is too big between your clock and servers clock.\n\nA: NTP, like TCP, has some Deep Theory and Practical Experience built into the protocol; if you alter its fundamental parameters, it stops having the synchronization properties that it was designed for. \nIf your device is sporadically connected, perhaps good old RDATE will serve you best. It doesn't handle clock-slewing, nor peer averaging, nor can it be secured against various subtle hacks that a man-in-the middle could play if it was worth his while. It just gets a reference date from a remote server and smacks the local clock with a hammer. But, it does it when you want it to, and its behavior is deterministic. \nThe RDATE accuracy is far worse than NTP affords, I wouldn't trust it for better than ±1 second, but if you are only sporadically attached, more accurate timing is not relevant; indeed, according to relativity it might not even be meaningful.\n\nA: In order to make the minpoll/maxpoll to be taken into account, you have to add then per server in your ntp.conf.\nIt is not quite recommended to mess with the NTP deamon (it has a built in mathod to optimize the frequency) but you will need to add these option like this :\nserver time.google.com iburst minpoll 12 maxpoll 17\nserver ntp.ubuntu.com iburst minpoll 12 maxpoll 17\nserver europe.pool.ntp.org iburst minpoll 12 maxpoll 17\n\nHere, if set the min frequecy to 2^12 seconds, and the max to 2^17 seconds.\nBy default, I found out that the NTP would make a request every minute or so. That’s far too much. Here I reduced the frequency from once an hour to once a day (roughtly).\n", "Q: Evernote printer for linux I am looking for evrenote printer. Same idea as PDF printer.

After a reboot, the boot process drops to the BusyBox shell and I end up at the prompt:\nBusyBox v1.18.5 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.5-1ubuntu4) built-in shell (ash)\nEnter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.\n\n(initramfs)\n\nI've been researching others who have had this same problem, but haven't been able to find any of those solutions to work for me.\nI tried the method described here, and after the final command \nmount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /root -o force\n\nit does nothing and gives me another (initramfs) prompt.\nI can boot to a live CD (USB) and get to a terminal, but it doesn't seem to do much good, as I can see the /dev/sda1 in the ls command, but it doesn't recognize it when I try to cd to it.\nOne more question: using the command fdisk -l how can I tell which mount point (sda1/sda2) is my windows partition and which one is Ubuntu?\n\nA: \nNote: Try this answer if you continue to face the issue even after attempting the steps in @ramsudharsan's answer. If you have not tried following those instructions yet I recommend you to do so since that seems to fix the problem in most cases.\n\nIt seems that you have a bad superblock. To fix this:\nFirstly, boot into a live CD or USB\nFind out your partition number by using\nsudo fdisk -l|grep Linux|grep -Ev 'swap'\n\nThen, list all superblocks by using the command:\nsudo dumpe2fs /dev/sda2 | grep superblock\n\nReplace sda2 to your drive number\nYou should get a similar output like this\n  Primary superblock at 0, Group descriptors at 1-6\n  Backup superblock at 32768, Group descriptors at 32769-32774\n  Backup superblock at 98304, Group descriptors at 98305-98310\n  Backup superblock at 163840, Group descriptors at 163841-163846\n  Backup superblock at 229376, Group descriptors at 229377-229382\n  Backup superblock at 294912, Group descriptors at 294913-294918\n  Backup superblock at 819200, Group descriptors at 819201-819206\n  Backup superblock at 884736, Group descriptors at 884737-884742\n  Backup superblock at 1605632, Group descriptors at 1605633-1605638\n  Backup superblock at 2654208, Group descriptors at 2654209-2654214\n  Backup superblock at 4096000, Group descriptors at 4096001-4096006\n  Backup superblock at 7962624, Group descriptors at 7962625-7962630\n  Backup superblock at 11239424, Group descriptors at 11239425-11239430\n  Backup superblock at 20480000, Group descriptors at 20480001-20480006\n  Backup superblock at 23887872, Group descriptors at 23887873-23887878\n\nChoose an alternate superblock from this list, for this case alternate superblock # 32768\nNow, to check and repair a Linux file system using alternate superblock # 32768:\nsudo fsck -b 32768 /dev/sda2 -y\n\nThe -y flag is used to skip all the Fix? questions and to answer them all with a yes automatically\nYou should get similar output like this:\nfsck 1.40.2 (12-Jul-2007)\ne2fsck 1.40.2 (12-Jul-2007)\n/dev/sda2 was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.\nPass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes\nPass 2: Checking directory structure\nPass 3: Checking directory connectivity\nPass 4: Checking reference counts\nPass 5: Checking group summary information\nFree blocks count wrong for group #241 (32254, counted=32253).\nFix? yes\nFree blocks count wrong for group #362 (32254, counted=32248).\nFix? yes\nFree blocks count wrong for group #368 (32254, counted=27774).\nFix? yes\n..........\n/dev/sda2: ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****\n/dev/sda2: 59586/30539776 files (0.6% non-contiguous), 3604682/61059048 blocks\n\nNow try mounting the partition\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt\n\nNow, try to browse the filesystem with the following commands\ncd /mnt\nmkdir test\nls -l\ncp file /path/to/safe/location\n\nIf you are able to perform the above commands, you have most probably fixed your error.\nNow, restart you computer and you should be able to boot normally.\n(source)\n\nA: Slightly different answer (Ubuntu 16.04), although other answers eventually led me to it.\nI first had to choose a recovery mode kernel before being able to see the error messages to know which partition/file system had errors.\nFrom then on, running fsck /dev/sdb1/ -y fixed it for me.\n\nA: I just tried a lucky shot by booting the system with the \"Parted Magic\" tool from a Live CD.

Is Ubuntu battery management better than Windows ? \nI have noticed that in Windows 7 a fully charged battery shows 3:30 minutes but in Ubuntu it shows 2:00 hours ...  !!!\nso what is the power management in Ubuntu ? good / better / fine / bad ?\n\nA: With Jupiter, yes. And without Jupiter, no. I have tested it on my laptop. As far as I know (correct me if i am wrong) kernel 3.4 has got a solution for this problem.\n\nA: In my experience power management in Linux is generally not as good on Linux as it is in Windows, because\n\n\n*\n\n*the hardware is designed to operate under Windows first\n\n*it takes a lot of Linux developer effort to support all the different manufacturers\n\n*manufacturers usually spend less time writing Linux drivers.\n\n\nHOWEVER this being said there is an exception to every rule, and it might just be the case that you are getting better battery life. However, I do not regard it as likely.\nThe only way to be sure - for your particular make and model of laptop (they are all different) is to test it. Computer designs are so complex that no two will behave in the same manner in situations like this.\n\nA: I think battery management on Ubuntu is just fine. To improve it, however, you can install Jupiter. According to WebUpd8.Org,\n\nJupiter is an appindicator (it now uses Python instead of Mono) designed to improve laptops / netbooks battery life. It can be used to switch between maximum, high performance and power saving modes, change the screen resolution and orientation, enable or disable bluetooth, touchpad, WiFi (if available) and so on. If you own an Asus EeePC netbook, there's also a separate package that adds support for Asus Super Hybrid Engine (SHE) as well as some other EeePC tweaks.\n\nTo install Jupiter, enter the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nSource\n\nA: It's much worse. On the other hand it's easier to improve it (using powertop for example) but still - I get 5-6 hours on Windows and 1 hour on Ubuntu (when I don't turn off additional card which is very hard to do) or 2-3 hours when I do turn off additional GPU.\n\nA: In my experience, I installed Ubuntu Netbook edition on my ASUS eee1001px, and i saw my battery life go from about 45 minutes in Win7HP, to ~2.5 hours in Ubuntu. \nThis was a GREAT improvement on the windows power management.\n", "Q: How do I disable the command line history in the dash?

But given that nothing else seems to have worked it couldn't hurt to play around with this value a bit.  Hope this helps, good luck!\nOriginal post:\nI just found this setting while doing something else and remembered seeing your question.  \nusing dconf-editor, navigate to com/cannonical/indicator/appmenu/hud\nYou'll notice a boolean setting store-usage-data with the following description:\nWhen the HUD executes operations it stores the execution in order to\nmake the future results better. Some users could choose to not want\nthis data to be stored. If that is the case they should disable this\nproperty.\n\nI'm skeptical that this could be what you are looking for as 'indicator/appmenu' would be a strange as heck place to put such a setting.  However, having read that description several times now, I can't figure out what else it could mean by \"when the HUD executes operations\".\nLong shot but figured I'd throw it out there.

I connected Empathy to my Facebook account and it worked really well for a couple of days, and all of the sudden it tells me \"Authentication failed for account Facebook (xxxxxxxxx)\". Is there a solution to fixing this problem?\n\nA: Sometimes Facebook has issues with messengers that isn't its own. I recommend giving it some time - in my experience it's usually back up and working within 24 hours. \n\nA: There seems to be no solution.  Empathy worked fine for several years, even after upgrading to 13.04. Then after applying an update to a 12.10 system, empathy quite working on that system.  After applying an update to my 13.04 system, empathize would no longer connect to facebook on that system. I fixed my problem by removing empathy and installing pidgin. Pidgin works.

This seems like the simplest method (if it would work), but I'm open to other methods. I'm not comfortable with ip tables, but from what I can gather I can assign a range of ports for deluge to use, and then use GUFW to only allow traffic on those ports to the ipredator server.\nI guess this is a deluge bug, or a quirk of how trackers work. Anyone else had the same issues? Any ideas for troubleshooting?\n\nA: If your vpn connects to 93.182.168.2\nThe Deluge interface must be 93.182.168.2*\nedit: This doesn't work.\nNeither does setting both the VPN Gateway and deluge interface to vpn.ipredator.se - deluge still runs when the vpn disconnects, but only connects to peers who are also using ipredator.\nThere seems to be no easy way to do this (could be done by using iptables or editing routes in /etc/ppp).\nSwitched to qbittorrent instead.

Is that possible?\nI like to test a lot of things, and with that, sometimes I end crashing things, so that's why I'd like to have some backup.\nI read in http://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide that I should make a copy of the root.disk, but I'm not sure... when I copy it back to the /ubuntu folder there's any risk of something going wrong? (grub issues or something like that).\nThanks in advance, and sorry for my ignorance.\n\nA: If it were me, as someone who likes to test things, I would do it differently.\nInstall virtualbox in windows, and install Ubuntu in a VM where you can easily back it up in total, and make copies or bookmarks.  You can create a clean install, then copy the disk image to have a 2nd clean install (or even make 3 copies if you have room).\nThis has the advantage of eliminating any grub issues, since each VM has its own grub, it's easy to back up, and can even be moved to a different computer easily.\nAnother advantage is to avoid WUBI, which is sometimes problematic.\nOr, the way I do it is to simply create several partitions on my disk, and install things directly.  But that requires understanding how GRUB works, and possibly solving problems now and then.  Good way to learn, if you're in to that, but stressful if you're not (or even if you are, until you learn.).\n", "Q: How can I write Ubuntu apps in Java?

I use exclusively Ubuntu, but at school and on other family computers, they use Winblows. Therefore, my flash drive is in FAT32 format for easy reading on both types of machines. However, I want to be sure that my drive can be defragmented. Is there any way to do this on Ubuntu? \n\nA: Moving all the data off the USB drive and then copying it back again will ensure that there are no fragmented files.\nHowever, there's absolutely no point in doing this since fragmentation does not affect performance of solid state drives\n\nA: If your computer is faster enough , e.g has cpu VT support\nLaunch a Windows virtual machine to do the defragment stuff for your USB key , e.g VBOX\n\nA: One reason to defrag a usb drive is if it will be used in your car stereo as a music source. For example, if you add a folder to your drive, your stereo might not be smart enough to place it alphabetically in line with the older folders. If you add tracks to a folder, you might find the tracks missing or somewhere near the last folder on the drive when searching through the drive on the stereo. A computer reads drives far more intelligently than a car stereo. A car stereo that reads usb drives has a very basic computer protocol and a fragmented drive will literally confuse it. I know this to be the case on the two different Sony stereos I have in my 2 cars. \nCopying the contents to a computer, deleting the files from the drive, and returning them back to the drive from the computer won't work properly either. You end up with DUPLICATE folders! This is because the little mark the computer places on your drive that says \"these files are deleted\" is completely ignored by a car stereo. The files are still there, your computer just is smart enough to ignore them if you tell it to delete them. A car stereo is much much dumber. \nNow, theoretically, if you were to replace 8 gb of data with 8 gb of data, it should overwrite the same sectors with that data and no errors should pop up. But if you added a folder and your new folder was to be placed somewhere in the middle alphabetically, then you would offset the remaining folders after that folder in a weird way. Replacing 8 gb of data with 8.2 gb of data with a folder in the middle would mean the 4 gb that came after that new folder would occupy slightly different parts of the usb drive. You might end up with the last 0.2 gb of the drive duplicating folders. Likewise, if you removed a folder, and did the copy, delete, and copy back procedure, you might end up with a few folders at the end of the list duplicated.\nThe only way I have found around this is to format the USB drive. In windows, you would opt to NOT do the 'quick format' as that just places a little note at the beginning of the drive without changing any of the data. The drive looks empty on the computer, but your car stereo will still think files are on it or show an error. So use the full length format procedure that takes a while (because it is doing stuff to the whole drive). That actually wipes the drive so you can start clean.\nIn ubuntu there are a few ways to get a fresh USB. gparted is the easy graphical tool, though it also shows your bootable drives and you can REALLY screw up your computer if you don't look carefully at what drive is being represented and select the right drive for the format process. A usb should be sdb1 or something like that as opposed to sda1 which would be your primary harddrive. Don't screw with anything with 'sda' in the name and make sure what you DO screw with is the same size as your USB drive and disappears if you remove the drive. (you have to refresh to see the change in gparted). \nThe command procedure for wiping a usb drive (after you have copied everything off of it) is pretty easy, actually. \nYou want to be sudo so I just do a \"sudo su\" as my first command and enter my password. First, you will need a few apps that don't come preinstalled with ubuntu (for some ungodly reason). Type the following:\napt-get install dosfstools\nThis will install the necessessary stuff to format to fat32 and do the magic. If you already have it, nothing will change. \nThen do the following command:\nfdisk -l\nyou will see a list of your drives, including the internal ones and the usb. The usb will probably be sdb1 or something with \"sdb\" and a number. You can double check (smart) by removing the usb drive and just repeating the command. If the sdb drive disappears from the second list you know that is the right one. Reinsert your drive and do fdisk -l one more time to be sure it reappears in the same place with the same sdb name. I will use \"sdbx\" in these commands, but you need to substitute the correct drive name instead, be it sdb1 or sdc1 or whatever your fdisk -l list shows. \nNext, you type the command\nmkdosfs -F 32 -I /dev/sdbx\nFor some weird reason this is really really fast and you might think it failed. But you will see no error if you did it right. You might have to unmount the drive and retry the format command again. If you get an error talking about unmounting the drive or that it is busy, close any windows showing the contents of the drive and type \nsudo umount /dev/sdbx\nI swear someone way back in the day screwed up the coding such that unmounting is done with umount istead of unmount. A simple mispelling and it will now and forever be that way. LOL \nOnce you have unmounted with umount, just do the format code again. It should work fine this time. Once you have done this code, you can close the terminal (when it is done) and copy your stuff back to the usb drive. I am not sure why it is so fast in ubuntu but so slow in windows. It almost seems like ubuntu is doing the same thing as a 'quick format' in windows, but I know for a FACT quick format in windows does NOT work, whereas this fast format in ubuntu ALWAYS works. \nAnyhow, hope this helps someone \n", "Q: How many computers I can connect to Landscape if I buy only one Ubuntu Advantage subscription? I want to buy 1 year Ubuntu Advantage subscription for 1 desktop. I actually do not need support, but I need Landscape. I want to manage all my office computers through Landscape. Are there any limitations in Ladscape?

These errors have signatures which make them unique. A grouping of all of the instances with the same signature is a \"problem\".\nIn simpler terms, the frequency is the number of times this specific problem was encountered and reported.\n\nWhat does the \"Mean Time Between Failure\" vertical axis on the graph mean?\n\nThis has since been replaced with \"Average number of crashes.\" This is the total number of reports seen in the day divided by the number of unique users sending those reports.\n\nWhat do the \"If all updates were installed\" vs \"Actual\" toggle mean? For me, clicking \"Actual\" just blanks the whole graph.\n\nThis is a placeholder. \"If all updates were installed\" will show the graph only for those users who had completely up to date systems.

I have yet to figure out how to change the window titles; however, the Unity panel color, within the Ambiance theme, can be changed using dconf-editor:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nUtilizing dconf-editor, navigate through \"org\", to \"gnome\", to \"desktop\", to \"interface\". Modify the entry \"gtk-color-scheme\" to read:\ndark_bg_color:#333377\n\nReplacing #333377 with whatever color you wish (in hexadecimal format). Then, log out and back in; the Unity bar should have changed appropriately, as have all of the menus. (If it has not, double check what you entered -- it seems that any typos cause the entire gtk-color-scheme entry to be ignored.)\nI have verified this to work in Ubuntu 12.04.2, including both the 3D and now-outmoded 2D versions of Unity.\n\nA: The color of the top panel bar and the launchpad background are a function of the wallpaper colors and the opacity/transparency set with Ubuntu Tweak or MyUnity. With Ubuntu Tweak select the \"Tweaks\" tab and then the \"Unity\" button. The parameters you'll want to change are \"Launcher opacity:\" and \"Panel opacity:\". Changing themes won't impact those colors. To change the label bar color you'd need to edits the image components used to create it. You could set the opacity gradient, dark bottom to light top, of the label bar before 12.04 and my upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 carried forward my former title bar opacity. I'm not sure where access to that parameter is in 12.04.\n\nA: By default, at least in 12.04, you only get a chance between dark and light (dark brown or pale cream) - these are selected in the \"appearance\" section of the system settings and are named \"Radiance\" and \"Ambiance\".  You may also be able to get certain accessibility modes such as \"high contrast\".\nBut you can, if you want, install different window decoration and GTK+ themes.  There are various packages available in the repositories which include metacity, GTK+, etc themes.  Using the myunity package you can then select these themes, including the ability to independently select different themes for the window titlebars and window controls.\nIt would be nice if there were an easier way to customise these colours without resorting to a bunch of other software, and themes of varying quality levels.

I have lots of important files and software installed. What can I do now?\nIs there any way to recover my home folder from the \"lost+found\" folder?\n\nA: The best solution is to boot from a Live CD and un-do the action you took before by accessing your hard drive from the Live CD.  If you find that any important files are lost, you'll probably need to restore them from backup.\nFor future reference, you should never move/remove your home directory, and the \"lost+found\" folder on a partition is not for normal use and you shouldn't use it for file storage.\nIf you want to hide stuff in your home directory from other users, you change its permissions - you don't move it outside of your home directory.\nI'd suggest to change your home directory's permissions to 771 - just that directory, not recursively.  That will still allow, for example, the login manager to access your wallpaper, but people will not be able to see a list of files in there.  If you want it to be even more hidden (so someone cannot see anything in there even if they know the directory/file name), use permission 770.\nKeep a record of what you did and what it was previously.\n", "Q: How can I create a backup file. iso like Edubuntu?

I have a bluetooth headset that has been working fine for about a year. Recently it has been failing, and I believe the time it has been problematic coincides with upgrading to 12.04.\nThe device pairs just fine. However, every time I try to connect, I get an error that says \"Connection failed: Connect failed\".\n\nI ran blueman-manager from the command line, and got this output (edited down to just the tail end when the connection failed):\n_________\nGenerate (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/blueman/gui/manager/ManagerDeviceMenu.py:230)\nBSHSBE04 \n_________\nunset_op (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/blueman/gui/manager/ManagerDeviceMenu.py:103)\nop: regenerating instance <ManagerDeviceMenu object at 0x2d16b90 (GtkMenu at 0x2e5b750)> \n_________\nfail (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/blueman/gui/manager/ManagerDeviceMenu.py:134)\nfail (DBusException(dbus.String(u'Connect failed'),),) \n\nAlso, based on suggestions, I tried disabling SSP with the following command: sudo hciconfig hci0 sspmode 0, but it does not seem to have helped. \nLastly, I have tried unpairing and repairing, and sometimes that gets me some connectivity, but not always, and in any case it's a hassle to have to repair every single time.\nWhat do I need to do to fix this error and restore my bluetooth device to its former level of reliability?\n\nA: My workaround for this issue is to remove the headset from the list of known devices (from Bluetooth setup) and repeat the pairing. \nThe headset will then continue to work as expected until it was connected to another machine (which could also be a virtual machine on the same computer). Then we again have to remove the device and repeat the pairing. \nThere may be an issue with secure sinmple pairing that occured from 11.10 but is supposed to be fixed in kernel 3.2.15 (see bug #931860). Try if disabling SSP resolves your issue too.\n\nA: I hope this is not too late or out of topic.\nI have namely 12.10 and had the same problem. I solved it opening \"Local Services\" in Blueman and selecting \"Advanced Audio Receiver\" and \"Headset Emulation\" under the Audio tag in the window that pops up.\nI accepted the fact that these services are \"Experimental\" and \"Very Experimental\". It worked for me.\n\nA: The thread is quite old, but maybe it helps someone:\nTry this, add:\nDisable = Media\ninto \"General\" section of /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf\nOn many forums they recommend adding \"Enable = Socket\" as well,\nbut in my case it made no difference; but \"Disable = Media\" is\ndifferent coffee, with this all my bluetooth headsets connect\nagain like a charm. \nAnyway, I noticed my bluetooth headset won't connect to my laptop\nanymore after I moved from Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04 (and subsequently\nto Mint 13 Maya).\nStrangely the headsets were connected immediately after pairing,\nbut could never connect afterwards...\n", "Q: how to check how long a program/application has been running or has run?

VMWare Player+Ubuntu+Unity 3d (compiz) works great on nVidia (faster one), while Intel shows exactly the same symptoms as yours. I haven't got it working on Intel, but this fact shows that the problem might be in the host OS video driver incompatibility with the VMWare Player/Ubuntu guest.

The main toplevel window has a search button which will display another toplevel gtk3 window. When I click the close button (near the titlebar) on the second gtk3 window it closes as expected. However, when I click on the search button again, the second toplevel window is not redrawn with all its widgets..instead it appears empty.\nIf on the other hand, I click the close button (gtk button seen at the bottom) it closes properly. And when reopned all the widgets can be seen.\nInfo: I created the UI using Glade.\nThe code is displayed below. However to get the UI files, you need to download the package.

After that its gone. \nYou can either keep the window from being destroyed (and hide it instead) by adding these two lines at the end of your init method:\nsecondwindow = self.builder2.get_object('window1')\nsecondwindow.connect('delete-event', lambda w, e: w.hide() or True)\n\nwhich replaces the delete event (documentation here). \nOr you can recreate the window everytime you open it, by placing those lines at the beginning of your search_clicked method:\nself.builder2 = Gtk.Builder()\nself.builder2.add_from_file(SECOND_UI_FILE)\nself.builder2.connect_signals(self)\n\n", "Q: Setting windows 7 as start up OS during Boot \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader? \n\nHow to set Windows 7 as default for booting?

For instance, it should then be possible to easily decrypt the encrypted files under Linux, Windows, OS X, etc.\nSo how can I encrypt files for maximum cross-platform compatibility?\n\nA: *\n\n*TrueCrypt can create mountable encrypted disk images\n\n\nYou can access TrueCrypt volumes on all three major OS. This is a disk encryption tool rather than a file encryption tool, so the choice of file system inside the disk image is important if you want to be able to mount the file system inside - chose a file system that works on all platforms you intend to use. FAT32 is probably the safest choice.\nNote that in order to install the TrueCrypt driver on Windows, you will need to be an Administrator user, or gain the cooperation of one, for every workstation you wish to access a TrueCrypt volume on. In addition, any process with access to the mounted file system will be able to read your files in the clear, so you must trust all systems on which you mount your encrypted volume.\n\n\n*\n\n*GnuPG can create individual encrypted files\n\n\nIf you can't use TrueCrypt, or don't like it's caveats, then you can encrypt individual files with GnuPG. Gpg4win provides easy to use Windows tools for GnuPG. While GnuPG will encrypt files at the simple \"password\" level, you may wish to read up a little on Public Key Cryptography.\n\nA: Use truecrypt, it works vor linux and windows and theres's even a mac os x version.\nhttp://www.truecrypt.org/downloads\n\nA: For Windows if you want to be able to use the right click context menu without going through the pgp4win program window you can use Cryptophane along side pgp4win, makes life a little easier and more convenient just as kgpg for KDE and nautilus-seahorse or the new version of seahorse-plugins does for Gnome.\n\nA: If you want to use your files on Windows, Mac OS and Android, I would suggest Kruptos 2 Pro is best fit along with any cloud folder integration. Kruptos does support USB drive as well.

The one downside of CryFS is that since it was designed primarily for cloud storage it doesn't have extra resilience checks built in for USB devices or other local storage, but one of the tenets of data storage is that having backups and testing that they work and the data is intact is important, so if you aren't using cloud storage with CryFS you should back up to multiple drives and make sure you safely remove them and run sync or your OS's equivalent to make sure all the data has been completely written before removing the drive.\n", "Q: OpenOffice Impress (MS Powerpoint alternative) not linking to Projector When i connect OpenOffice ppt for projector, it doesnt display or detect anything.While i can run the same in my windows OS installed alongside.

It will report the PID and command in the terminal you ran it in.\nIn general, xprop and xwininfo will provide you with a lot of information about an open window.\n\nThe \"apostrophes\" I used for surrounding cat are the ~ key on my keyboard without pressing shift. This should give you some more info on the subject:\nGrave Accents and the backquote\n\nA: You can try xprop | grep WM_CLASS and then click on the window you are interested in.\nExamples:\n#> xprop | grep WM_CLASS\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"gedit\", \"Gedit\"\n\n#> xprop | grep WM_CLASS\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"gcalctool\", \"Gcalctool\"\n\nAnd since we need the PID, we need to do xprop | grep PID.\n\nA: You can get process info using:\n$ ps -f --pid $(xprop _NET_WM_PID | grep -o '[0-9]*')\n\n\nA: Run this command in a terminal:\nxprop | awk '/PID/ {print $3}'\n\nYour mouse pointer will be replaced with crosshairs; select the window you're interested in.\nThis method shows just the PID of the process who owns that window (which appears to be what you want).\n\nA: Running xprop | awk '/_NET_WM_PID\\(CARDINAL\\)/{print $NF}' and clicking the window you want the PID of will print the PID to the terminal.\n", "Q: Cant ubuntu dash search files from every partition of my hard drive?

Yo can do this with gparted  (simple google for this program - for free and in linux).  During the installation Ubuntu will recognise this partition.

My original hard drive was of 2T and after Ubuntu installation it became 1T for windows and remaining 1T space is missing both in windows and in Ubuntu. I need your help in recovering the remaining 1T and associate it with Ubuntu. \n\nA: Use gparted to see the partition on your hard disk. I cannot understand: you have 2 partitions (1 windows and 1 ubuntu) of 500 gb each? \nOtherwise You can use gparted to move or resize the partition. In windows 7 you can use the Device Manager to expand your hard disk also.\n\nA: If you are not able to see the 1TB using(logging in into) windows(or a software in windows) then its okay because windows cannot detect the EXT4 filesystem used by linux.\nAlso to check if that 1tb has been given to Ubuntu, you can either install Gparted orJust go to the DISK UTILITY to check where the space has been occupied.\nP.S: If dusing installation you had selected the option \"INSTALL ALONGSIDE WINDOWS7\"\n     then by default Ubuntu has reassigned the 1TB to itself and re sized the 2tb of only windows partition(mostly NTFS) to 1TB.(You can obviously confirm like stated b4 using Gparted or DISK UTILITY) \n", "Q: Unable to open Eclipse IDE due to missing symlink I'm not a big fan of Eclipse but sometimes I use it to deploy apps on Google app-engine.

Since I recently upgraded my IT infrastructure, I decided to use my old laptop as a home server. The problem is that the machine sports a powerful nVidia card that even at idle generates enough heat to stay 80°C hot.\nThe laptop is a DELL XPS M1710, with a512MB DDR3 nVidia GeForce Go 7950 GTX graphics card. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.\nGiven that I control the server via SSH, I thought that maybe I could somehow \"turn off\" the video card... is this at all possible? If yes, how?\n\nA: The nouveau driver doesn't have a good reputation when it comes to power saving, and since it uses KMS it is probably in use even without X running. Try blacklisting it. Put the following in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau-local.conf:\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\nand then reboot.\nHowever, it might be necessary to install the proprietary driver and load up X to get proper power management of the card.\n\nA: There are several things you can try.  Personally when I installed ubuntu server to a laptop I just closed the lid which disable the display, but had to make sure it didn't turn off the laptop when I did that.\nIf your savvy enough which sounds like you are .. you could try under clocking your GPU.  This probably wouldn't give you any energy savings dollar wise, but this should solve your heat issue.\nAlso some BIOs have the ability to set what kind of performance you want for your GPU.  You could probably change it from there.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Gnome shell does not log out properly in Ubuntu 11.10 My problem is that when I log out from a gnome shell session I get a blank screen instead of the display manager.

I dual booted ubuntu 11.04/11.10 a while ago with a USB stick and i want to uninstall it. \nI would like to completely uninstall the old version and get 12.04.\nI have a 64 bit laptop. Please help!\n\nA: The first thing you should do is backup your data. \n\n\n*\n\n*Then download the iso of 12.04\n\n*burn it on a disk or usb.\n\n*After that you can boot in the live CD/USB and select install\n\n*During the installation you will be prompt either to replace or upgrade\n\n*Select Erase Ubuntu 11.10 and reinstall.\n\n\n\n\nA: To answer your question:\nFirst, prepare a bootable USB stick with Ubuntu 12.04 on it. Then restart your computer and boot on your stick. Select \"Try Ubuntu without installing\". When you see the desktop, launch the app called \"Gparted\". This will permit you to format the partitions where you previously installed Ubuntu.\nHowever, from another question you asked today, I think that what you want to do is install Ubuntu 12.04. If this is true, then you don't have to worry about erasing the previous installations. You have two possibilities.\nEither you boot into Ubuntu 11.10, you search for updates and the Update Manager will propose you to upgrade to the newer version. Or you boot on the 12.04 USB stick and you follow the instructions. Be sure to check \"Format drive\" when you see it.\nThe first option will permit you to keep your documents, settings and installed programs.\n\nA: First, I'd suggest making the Live CD as mentioned. Be sure to backup what you have, if there is anything you don't want to loose. Next, boot from the CD and pick to try 12.04, and make sure it works well for you (no issues/incompatibilities, etc).\nThen, you can either choose to do a clean install (letting it erase 11.10), or, what I do,  install 12.04 along side of 11.10. After the install, I boot up to 12.04, install the apps I want, and mount the partition for 11.10 so that I can copy over stuff from my home directory.\nFinally, after I've spent time with 12.04, making sure everything is cool, and ensuring I've got everything off of my 11.10 home directory, I do a backup, use gparted to remove the 11.10 partition, resize the 12.04 to use up all the space, and then use the grub2 steps to update grub and it'll remove the unused boot choice for 11.10.\n\nA: To uninstall any operating system you have to format that volume/drive/partition\nIf you are using windows as the other os, you will have to install an external application because windows cannot detect the linux file system(ext4)(easus is such an application)\nif you use the other os also ubuntu then you can use GPARTED(install from software center) or DISK UTILITY(already installed) to delete the unwanted partition...\n\nA: No need to uninstall the old version. When you begin the 12.04 install it will ask you if you want to replace ,upgrade, or run along side the other operating systems on the harddrive. Just say replace 11.10 and it will wipe it clean for you. Granted if you have personal files that are not backed up you might want to upgrade and hopefully what ever you did will be fixed by the update.\n", "Q: Edubuntu boots in  low graphics mode. with an Intel HD Graphics system I have a HD Intel graphics card in my laptop.

I have installed both VLC and projectM (PulseAudio) from the Software Center, but I the visualizations that appear in Audio -> Visualizations have not changed. How can I launch the projectM visualizations from VLC.\n(I'm using Ubuntu 11.10.)\nThanks!\n\nA: Project M is not automatically integrated into VLC (or any application that I know of). You would need to find a plugin for the application that allows you to use Project M's visualizations.\nTo my knowledge, there is no existing plugin for VLC that allows you to do this. So, like spm says, you will need to start projectM-pulseaudio separately.\n\nA: You can't as far as I know.\nThe command to start the visualizations is projectM-pulseaudio just type that into a terminal or command window and it'll open in a separate window.\n", "Q: Is there any way to force Dropbox to open the Dropbox folder in a file manager other than Nautilus? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, with both PCManFM and Nautilus installed.\nI've succesfully set the default file manager to PCManFM: I've accomplished that by doing the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-clicking a directory - Open With... - choose PCManFM\n\n*Choosing PCManFM as the file manager in exo-preferred-applications\n\n*Running mimeopen -d ~/Dropbox, and choosing PCManFM\n\n\nRight now, every folder I open, opens in PCManFM. This is what I want. However, when I click the Dropbox icon in the upper bar of the screen, and then 'Open Dropbox Folder', Dropbox will be opened in Nautilus instead of PCManFM. Is there any way to force Dropbox to open it in PCManFM instead?\n\nA: In my experience (described in greater detail here):\n\n*\n\n*If Nautilus is installed, clicking on the Dropbox tray icon or on the \"Open Dropbox Folder\" menu item will launch Nautilus regardless of other settings.\n\n*If Nautilus is not installed, the Dropbox daemon will look for your \"inode/directory\" mimetype.\n\n*If Nautilus is not installed and \"inode/directory\" mimetype is not set, the default browser (i.e. the preferred \"x-www-browser\") will be launched.\n\nP.S.: As a quick and dirty workaround, you might wish to create a script with, say, the following code\n#!/bin/bash  \nexec your-favorite-file-manager $@  \nexit 0  \n\ncall it 'nautilus' and place it somewhere in your $PATH.\n\nA: Uninstalling Nautilus worked for me. \nIf you want to keep Nautilus, I think the issue is similar to setting the default file manager for Firefox, and there is more info available about that, for example here: How to set up Dolphin as default file manager? \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 not showing in boot selection after installing from Wubi in Windows 7 I know there are already several instances of this problem but I just don't find a similar issue as mine so pardon for being redundant.I am new to Ubuntu but I very much like to understand the whole thing about it.\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 from WUBI on my Existing Windows 7 OS.

I have Windows 7 and I want to boot Linux from a memory stick without installing it as I would like to run two OSs on the same PC without losing all my files. \nDoes anyone know how to get into the OS selection menu on a Dell Inspiron duo?\n\nA: What you want to do is boot the OS from your computer system's BIOS and leave your current OS untouched. That's easy.\nFollow the above instructions, after it's on the USB it's now a \"LiveUSB\" or \"bootable USB\".\nThe OS will then be loaded, if everything is set up correctly, by BIOS and put into your computer's memory/video memory.\nIt will be the main OS in memory, and Windows will remain on your other media untouched.\nYou can also optionally do a full install of Ubuntu on a USB stick.\n\nA: Okay first let me tell you that you can properly install Ubuntu along with existing windows without loosing any data!!!\ni.e you can use 2 OSs properly installed!!\nAnd about the USB boot,you will have to make a bootable USB(having the iso immage of the Linux/Ubuntu you want to install) using an application for doing so(Google it for a windows app) then you have to enter the bios setup and change the boot-order to USB as 1st boot device and save and exit.\ninsert the USB and restart...Linux will start.\n\nA: My understanding of your question is that you want to boot on Ubuntu from a USB memory stick. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create that USB stick by following those instructions.\n\n*Shutdown your computer, plug the stick in and restart your computer.\n\n\nYou are done !\nIf this doesn't work, maybe you have to configure your BIOS. Just follow those instructions to achieve that. If you still have problems, or if this does not answer your question, don't hesitate to edit your question with more details; it will be a pleasure to help you.\n\nA: If I understand the question correctly, the thing you are worried about is losing your files when installing Ubuntu. There are three solutions to this problem:\nRunning from a USB stick\nAs this is specifically what you asked for, I will describe this method first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu on the USB stick.\n\n*Turn off your computer, insert the USB stick and turn it on again.\n\n*You may have to enter BIOS setup and change the boot order to make the USB stick higher priority than your hard drive. The exact process varies from PC to PC, but it is described for the Dell Inspiron Duo here.\n\n*Your computer should automatically start Ubuntu off the USB stick now.\n\n\nThere are however a few downsides to this if you're planning to use Ubuntu on a daily basis:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running an operating system on a USB stick is significantly slower than running it on a hard drive, and you will notice this.\n\n*The available space on a USB stick will also be significantly less than on a hard drive, and with daily use you can may quickly run out of free space.\n\n\nInstalling Ubuntu inside Windows\nA second method is to install Ubuntu from within Windows using Wubi. The installer will install Ubuntu alongside your existing Windows installation, so that your existing data is preserved, and you can easily uninstall it like any other application. When you start your computer, you will be able to choose if you want to boot into Ubuntu or Windows.\nInstalling Ubuntu normally\nBy default, the regular Ubuntu CD installer will repartition your hard drive in such a way that all existing data is preserved. So even if you install it this way, you won't lose your files in Windows, and you will get the option to boot into Ubuntu or Windows when you start your computer. This is very similar to installing Ubuntu inside Windows, except that you can't uninstall it as easily.\n", "Q: microphone trouble I am trying to use my Google Voice and the other party cannot hear me.  So I tried recoding something and it did not work. So how do I run some sort of diagnostic to check to see of my microphone is working?\n\nA: Click on the Sound Menu indicator, up right of your screen. Select \"Sound Settings…\".\nIn the newly opened app, go to the \"Input\" tab. If a sound input device is detected, it should then appear in the list on the left and you can make some tests on the right.\n\nA: Click on your Sound system Icon (looks like a speaker) go to \"Sound Settings\".\nIn sound settings there is an \"Input\" tab click on it.\nOn the left hand side you should see all the detected input devices on the right you will see the available options for the selected device. If the device is muted (default behavior) you will need to un-mute it before the Input Level monitor will display the detected sound.\nIf it still isn't detecting sound or if your device isn't showing up we will need more information about the device in question to help further. \n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to switch applications (Alt+Tab) isn't working In Ubuntu 12.04 64Bit, the keyboard shortcut to switch applications (Alt+Tab)is not working\nI have done a Full Update/Upgrade.\nKeyboard Layout: US\nFormat: US\nInput Source: US\nGUI: Gnome Classic  \nDoes any know how to fix this?\n\nA: Workaround until the bug is addressed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install & run ccsm:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager && ccsm\n\n*Enable 'Application Switcher' under 'Window Management'\nThis worked for me \n(note that I'm using Linux Mint 13 Maya + 'Gnome Classic' session)\n\nA: Launch the \"keyboard\" app from the Dash, and go to the \"Shortcuts\" tab. See if your shortcut is well configured.\nIt is located under the \"Navigation\" category and named as \"Switch applications\".\n\nA: Download and run CCSM. After opening it, go to Ubuntu Unity Plugin > Switcher (top tab) > Key to start the switcher\nErase/edit whatever keys it says there (change it to anything else). Then click on the right button to Reset it to Tab.\nIf that doesn't work, you definitely have a system bug, or a faulty keyboard.\n", "Q: Installing KDE in Ubuntu 12.04 Is it better to use Kubuntu or Ubuntu with KDE? For example, if I were to install KDE in Ubuntu will there be any instability or conflict? \nWill these two get mixed up with themes and icons?  I have had a bad experience with GNOME shell in Ubuntu 12.04. When I logged in with GNOME, the GNOME theme was mixed up with unity,the same happened with Unity, so I had to uninstall GNOME.\nIs there any way to make Ubuntu look exactly like Kubuntu (same UI, menus and theme); installing the KDE applications are not important to me. \nI want to keep both Unity and KDE.\n\nA: I found very useful installing several desktop environments but creating separated accounts to use them. I have installed Ubuntu 12.04.\nFor example:\n- I have the default Ubuntu 12.04 Unity Desktop under the default user account \"mauricio\". This account is my Unity Desktop. But then I wanted to have a GnomeShell desktop and,\n- I installed Gnome-Shell and created a new user account with name \"VenGshell\" and I use Gnome-shell there and configure the whole account with Gnome-shell. So my Unity preferences in my Unity desktop have nothing to do in this Gnome-Shell account, Get it?\n- Then I wanted to have a KDE desktop in this same Ubuntu installation. So I installed the Kubuntu-Desktop and created another user account under the name of \"MaVriK\". And I configure it to use KDE desktop environment and, of course again, It is completely apart and nothing to do with the other desktop customizations.\nThis kind of configuration is, IMHO, the best way to have every desktop environment living together under the same Linux installation.\nSo:\n- If I want to use Unity: I login under \"mauricio\".\n- If I want to use Gnome-Shell: I login to \"VenGShell\".\n- If I want to use KDE: I login to \"MavriK\"\nThat easy.\nI never ever have any performance issues under this configuration, in any desktop environment.\nAbout applications all showing in the Apps menu? I just do not really care about it! because for that task there are the panels. I have access to my prefered apps I use to use daily in those panels, I just add the app icons there and forget about app menus.\nAnd if I want to launch an app in particular, there is Gnome-Do to easily \"DO\" that task!\nBye.\n\nA: If you want everything in KDE, install kde-full package. \nYou can install it by running sudo apt-get install kde-full command in a terminal. It's about 1 GB worth of files.\nI did that on Ubuntu 12.04 and found it's quite nice.  Very polished and smooth.  I tried default Kubuntu distribution and liked it less.\nSome of your Unity/Gnome applications will be shown in the KDE menus. If you right click on the top of the menu, above the search bar,  you can select an option to edit the menu which you can use to disable showing Gnome/Unity applications icons in KDE menu.\nWhen I installed the Gnome shell,I found that, the Gnome windows were themed much like windows in Unity. Unity uses Gnome code, so that isn't surprising.\n\nA: You can download just the KDE window manager or KDE with all of the extras that you would find with kubuntu. I recommend the latter. It would be the safest.\n sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nor Using Software Center \nThat will install everything you need.\n", "Q: Grub loader not appearing on boot when dual booting with Windows 7 I've just dual booted Windows 7 and Ubuntu, but whenever I boot my computer the grub loader asking me which OS I want to boot into doesn't appear and I get launched straight into Windows.

I'd like to save an option to hibernate my computer, so I have to increase my SWAP from 2GiB to 4GiB. \nMy /etc/fstab looks like this:\nUUID=57b6e4ca-86f6-440d-8d45-2295a86a946b /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n/dev/mapper/sda6_crypt /home           ext4    defaults        0       2\n/dev/mapper/sda5_crypt none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nMy /etc/crypttab looks like this:\nsda5_crypt UUID=17ec5831-e49e-4eb0-aa63-05101038a85c none luks,swap\nsda6_crypt UUID=2a01b2a0-e954-4a97-9202-6cdbc0152e73 none luks\n\nAppreciate any help.\n\nA: Should be simple. Assuming sda5_crypt is your swap:\nsudo swapoff -a                   # turns all swaps off\nsudo cryptsetup resize sda5_crypt # grows to maximum possible size\nsudo mkswap /dev/sda5_crypt       # makes new swap using the new size\nsudo swapon -a                    # turns all swaps on again\n\nI just tested this on Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: Because the partitions are encrypted, it's not possible to resize them using the normal tools such as parted/gparted.  This is because the actual partition on disk is not a valid file system, but just an encrypted block, which appears like a string of seemingly random data.\nYou can delete them and totally recreate them.  If you only need to resize your swap, and to do this you don't need to resize any other (encrypted) partition, then trashing and re-installing it is going to be easy.  But I assume that's not the case, as not many people will just leave unallocated space on the drive should they want to increase the swap partition (unless you're able to expand it into your un-encrypted root partition?).  Otherwise you may be able to recreate your swap and home partitions, and copy across your files from an external drive.  You will probably need to be familiar with cryptsetup and the way luks works.  Otherwise a clean install is in order.\nA common configuration with LUKS is to use LVM on top of it, which gives you a much easier way of resizing partitions inside your encrypted block - because LUKS means you have multiple partitions inside the same block, you don't need to resize the container to resize the partitions inside.  If you are going to resort to a clean install, the alternate installer CD makes setting up a LUKS partition with LVM on top of it easy.\nMost online tutorials you'll find about resizing a LUKS partition are actually about resizing LVM volumnes inside of one instead.\n\nA: There is no way to enlarging encrypted swap partition. The solution is to reinstall the system with setting up new partition.\n\nA: Try booting on a Live CD or Live USB stick. Then choose \"Try Ubuntu without installing it\". When you get to the desktop, launch the app called Gparted.\nIn this application, you will be able to change the size of the partitions, including the swap one. But the latter one requires you first to right-click on the swap partition line and select \"Swap off\". Then you will be able to make your changes.\n", "Q: Cannot load vboxdrv module in 12.04 and 3.2.0-23-realtime I'm trying to start virtualbox without success, please give some advice on how to fix it:\nThe GUI opens up successfully and I can add existing images but when I try to start a virtual machine, I get the message: \nKernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)\n\nThe VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not loaded or there is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv.

When I launch Tor-Browser, it first launches Vidalia, then a special version of Firefox bundled with the Tor Browser package. If I try to download a (legal!) torrent in the Tor Browser version of Firefox, it launches Transmission to do so. \nIF I launch Transmission from within the Tor Browser, it will remember my current torrents. This persists from one Tor Browser session to the next, including logouts, shutdowns, etc. \nIf, however, I try to launch Transmission from its location (usr/bin/transmission-gtk), it starts Transmission \"fresh\" without remembering any torrents or other settings. \nI assume Transmission is somehow loading another version of itself for Firefox -- the one that remembers things -- that isn't somewhere I can find it. \nOnly one transmission-gtk executable appears when I search my file system... the one in usr/bin.\nWhat's going on? How can I open Transmission and have it \"remember\" things without having to start a torrent on Tor-Browser first? \n\nA: Warning: Under no circumstances is it safe to use BitTorrent and Tor together. As an alternative, a VPN will be \"safe\" if you trust the VPN (in many countries, ISP's are required to log while VPN's are not), or you could use an anonymising network that was designed for file-sharing, such as I2P. \nProceed at your own risk.\nHow Tor-Browser uses Transmission\n\nIf I try to download a (legal!) torrent in the Tor Browser version of Firefox, it launches Transmission to do so. ... If, however, I try to launch Transmission from its location (usr/bin/transmission-gtk), it starts Transmission \"fresh\"\n\nThere is only one copy of the actual program, in /usr/bin/ as you noted. What Tor-browser does is start Transmission with a separate profile, so that torrents will be downloaded over Tor (this is usually slower). If you wish to download the torrent normally instead, start the normal Transmission, and then either save a torrent from Tor-browser and load it, or copy-and-paste the link from Tor-browser. The alternative is to simply browse using regular Firefox and click on the .torrent link, which should open normal Transmission.\n\nUse one common profile for Tor-Transmission and regular Transmission\nIf you want Transmission to use a common profile for both normal and Tor-browser torrents, you can do the following: (step-by-step not given because it is very easy to lose all currently downloading/paused torrents when you do this!) \n\n\n*\n\n*Regular Transmission profile is stored in $HOME/.config/transmission\n\n*Tor-browser Transmission profile is inside the tor-browser directory, e.g.\ntor-browser_en-US/.config/transmission\n\n*To create a common profile, you must create a symlink from one to the other using ln -s; of the two profiles, remove the transmission folder (rm -rf) of the one which is least used or contains fewer torrents (you will lose these); then recreate it as a symlink to the other transmission directory.\n\n*I recommend leaving the normal config ($HOME/.config) intact and linking the Tor config to it; if you do the reverse, your Transmission may not download unless you are connected to Tor. Note that your torrent downloading will occur over your regular, non-anonymous network in this case, even if you click on a torrent from within Tor-browser!\n", "Q: How to make my screen brightness not change when I plug my laptop in I do not want my laptop to change brightness when my laptop power is plugged in or unplugged. I set my brightness based on how bright my surroundings are. If I am in a dark room, I set my brightness very low and when I plug my laptop in the brightness gets set to maximum which feels like sticking my eyes in boiling lava.\nIn System Settings ▸ Brightness and Lock the Dim screen to save power checkbox is unchecked.\nMy laptop is an HP Mini 110\nIn case it is an acpi issue I have put my acpi-support file here \n[link removed because it expired]\n\nA: I tested a solution that works fine for me.\nOne solution is to add a script file in /etc/pm/power.d/\nJust creates a file \nsudo vi /etc/pm/power.d/run_after_pwrmanagmt.sh\n\nThen writes this code into this file :\ncase \"${1}\" in\n    true) #battery_mode\n        xinput set-int-prop 12 277 8 2 3 0 0 1 3 2\n        echo 4000 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n;;\n    false) #ac_mode\n        xinput set-int-prop 12 277 8 2 3 0 0 1 3 2\n        echo 4000 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nesac\n\nNow, you need to give execution rights to this file by typing \nsudo chmod +x /etc/pm/power.d/run_after_pwrmanagmt.sh\n\nNow it should work fine, just test to plug/unplug your computer.\nNote that you can do similar things after a suspend (/etc/pm/sleep.d/run_after_sleep.sh), that's how I found out this solution... You will find information on the web...\nNote that xinput is just a command for my trackpad to set the middle button working... You should skip the two lines xinput if not needed (or adapt ).\nFor the value 4000, it may be diffrent for each screen, you should first see what is your max value with the command cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness\nHope this helps, and that the moderator will not delete this post since this is an answer and not a question.\nThanks\n\nA: Just ran into the same problem on my Dell Vostro.\nIt turned out that Ubuntu just saves brightness level set by fn+brightness keys on my laptop. But it saves different levels for different states: plugged and unplugged. So, I just had to set up my brightness level twice, once on battery, and once plugged in :)\nI know it's super easy, but I still had to search a bit before I came up to this. Maybe it will help someone else.\n\nA: For me (with Lenovo X61s) the unwanted display dimming when unplugging from line power was apparently not related to power management software or similar, but rather due to a BIOS setting for screen brightness in Config-Display. Via that BIOS setting it was possible to avoid the dimming.\n\nA: The only option that worked for me was to do this:\nme=`whoami`\nmax=`cat /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/max_brightness`\nsudo chown ${me}:${me} /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness\nsudo chmod o+x /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness\necho ${max} > /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness\nsudo chmod 444 /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness\nsudo chown root:root /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness\nexit\n\nI know it's not the prettiest, but it works. I just put this into a script and if my brightness ever dims on me, I just run it and it instantly changes it back for me.\n\nA: Using the dconf editor (https://pkgs.org/download/dconf-editor), navigate to the following directory:\norg/gnome/shell/extensions/dim-on-battery\nAnd set the key legacy-mode to On. Now, your PC will memorize your last settings when using the bright control. If you don't want them to change when plugging in/out the AC supply, just set them to the same value.\n\nA: This worked for my Acer Nitro 5. I edited the grub file which is at /etc/default/grub by adding acpi_backlight=vendor to the end of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\", so the result looks like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nThen I ran update-grub command in the terminal and restarted the machine.\nThis basically allows loading the vendor drivers before the Linux drivers.\n\nA: Under \"brightness and lock\" in the system settings, remove the checkbox from \"Dim screen to save power\".\nThis will keep your screen at the same brightness all the time, instead of dimming it when running on battery power and making it brighter when it's on mains power.\nYou should still be able to adjust the screen brightness manually as you desire in order to save power or when you need more light.\nIf your \"brightness and lock\" settings do not have this option, then you have a different issue, so let us know.\n", "Q: Sounds comes out of both headset and speakers Ubuntu 12.04 is Great except sound problems.\nthis issue is common , sound comes out the headset and speakers at the same time , i have tried to find a solution through forums , internet .......but not yet able to fix that !\nit's so annoying and it's the only reason keeping me from using 12.04.\nAny fix soon ?\n\nA: Try configuring levels with alsamixer or gnome-alsamixer. The sliders you get depend of which sound card / ALSA driver you are using but there's usually a \"master\" and a \"headset\" sliders that you can use individually. After you setup your levels, you can make them default with alsactl store.\nAlso, if you do work with audio or video production, you want to look at using Jack instead of PulseAudio (or use both). The easiest way to set it up in my experience is using KXStudio's packages.\n\nA: I have something like this going on with my Sony VPCZ114GX, there is a workaround posted for my model at this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/960124 Basically involves loading up David Henninsson's hda-jack-retask from his ppa at https://launchpad.net/~diwic/+archive/hda and then try Wouter van der Graaf's workaround on comment #7.\nAs for getting the model of your sound card, I tried the below.

I have a Google Calendar (& account) and I want to be able to use this without opening the browser.\nI want to get the Unity Calendar lens working, so that it shows events coming up, and it allows me a quick way to add new events. However, after installing it, it does not find any events, nor allow me to add a new event.\nNote that I've installed Lightning 1.4, Evolution mirror 0.2.3, Evolution, and unity-calendar lens. I've also installed Calendar-indicator.\nI suspect that somehow the lens is not getting the calendar information from thunderbird via evolution.\nA bit of searching around led me to try this command: /usr/lib/calendar-lens/calendar-lens-daemon.py.

If not, have you actually run Evolution?\nWhen Evolution first runs, it sets up the default calendars in its backend.  Until then, no calendars exist in Evolution.  This means that Evolution Mirror has no calendar to mirror Lightning's events to and also that the Calendar lens has no data source to get events from.\nThe error message you posted suggests that the lens is finding no calendars at all when it asks evolution for a list of them.\nSo, try running Evolution.  You don't need to set up any email accounts in it.  Then try adding an event in Lightning and see if it appears in the lens.  If this works, you'll also need to reset Evolution Mirror to resend all your existing events in Lightning to Evolution.  To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Thunderbird, go to Edit --> Preferences --> Advanced --> Config Editor \n\n*In the config editor, search for evolution.  \n\n*Find the entry for extensions.evolutionmirror.firstrun.  \n\n*Double click on the entry to change its value to True\n\n*Restart Thunderbird.  On restart, all your events will be copied into Evolution's database and subsequent updates to events in Lightning will be reflected in Evolution.\n\n\nA: The reason is a missing dependency (python-gnome2).\nsudo apt-get install python-gnome2\nThis should solve the issue.\n", "Q: How to troubleshot a printer failure?

But if I run sudo service cups stop && sleep 1 && sudo service cups start the problem persists.   \nI don't know if it is related to the bug #973270 because my print is connected at usb not at ipp.  \nLooks like Bas-Roufs has had the same problem after he fixed his installation problem as he said in a deleted answer.  \nThe content of /var/log/cups/error.log is:  \nW [16/May/2012:20:49:53 -0300] failed to CreateProfile: org.freedesktop.ColorManager.AlreadyExists:profile id 'Samsung-ML-1860-Series-Gray..' already exists\nW [16/May/2012:20:49:53 -0300] failed to CreateDevice: org.freedesktop.ColorManager.AlreadyExists:device id 'cups-Samsung-ML-1860-Series' already exists\nW [16/May/2012:20:49:53 -0300] failed to CreateProfile: org.freedesktop.ColorManager.AlreadyExists:profile id 'Samsung-ML-1860-Series-Gray..' already exists\nW [16/May/2012:20:49:53 -0300] failed to CreateDevice: org.freedesktop.ColorManager.AlreadyExists:device id 'cups-Samsung-ML-1860-Series' already exists\nW [16/May/2012:20:49:53 -0300] failed to CreateProfile: org.freedesktop.ColorManager.AlreadyExists:profile id 'Samsung-ML-1860-Series-Gray..' already exists\nW [16/May/2012:20:49:53 -0300] failed to CreateDevice: org.freedesktop.ColorManager.AlreadyExists:device id 'cups-Samsung-ML-1860-Series' already exists\n\nI have followed the wiki DebuggingPrintingProblems and made a bug report (#1003422).  \nThe result of tail -f /var/log/syslog is:  \n\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: URI contains USB serial number\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: URI match: usb://Samsung/ML-1860%20Series?serial=Z5M7BDAB501185X.\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: device devpath is /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.1\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: Device already handled\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: Consider also queues with \"/usb/lp0\" or \"/usblp0\" in their URIs as matching\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: URI of print queue: mfp:/dev/mfp4, normalized: mfp dev mfp4\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: URI of detected printer: usb://Samsung/ML-1860%20Series?serial=Z5M7BDAB501185X., normalized: samsung ml 1860 series serial z5m7bdab501185x\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: URI of print queue: usb://Samsung/ML-1860%20Series?serial=Z5M7BDAB501185X., normalized: samsung ml 1860 series serial z5m7bdab501185x\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: URI of detected printer: usb://Samsung/ML-1860%20Series?serial=Z5M7BDAB501185X., normalized: samsung ml 1860 series serial z5m7bdab501185x\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: Queue ipp://localhost:631/printers/ML-1860-Series has matching device URI\nMay 23 10:00:26 desguai3 udev-configure-printer: Re-enabled printer ipp://localhost:631/printers/ML-1860-Series\n\nAt Ubuntu forum there is a thread about it too.\nSo how can I troubleshot this failure?

It seems that there is a problem with using Belkin N150 wireless routers. The Internet connection is very flaky, and the connection drops frequently for a few minutes before it is again re-established.\nI found the following link that discusses how to solve this problem on other non-Linux platforms.\nhttp://www.wurwaldesign.com/blog/2011/03/belkin-n150-router-slow-solutions-for-complete-beginners/\nIt would help if anyone can suggest ways to solve this issue on Ubuntu.\n\nA: This may not be a solution to the problem but it's a work around if you have an Android phone (depends on the model and carrier restrictions too).\nI bought a Belkin N150 Wireless USB Adapter. It worked great for Windows 7 but when I installed Ubuntu although it paired well, I didn't get good signal and would disconnect most of the times. Belkin has driver for Mac And Windows but not for Ubuntu. I needed the Internet badly (my router is in living room and my study room is far from living room and I was lazy to shop for a compatible new wireless adapter). \nIt struck to me that Android phones have tethering option. I plugged my phone (Google Nexus)(it works with S3 too)  to the Ubuntu System and Turned on the USB tethering option and viola I got a great wired signal and was able to browse and download stuff again from Ubuntu m/c. \nThat solved my problem temporarily (until I find a right driver or new wireless adapter that works for Ubuntu). Forgot to mention that my phone is connected using WI-FI (also works with 3G).\n\nA: The setting that seems most relevant is the following: Visit your router settings. Change the channel id and wireless mode. Try using channels 9 or 11. My wireless mode was initially 802.11b&802.11g&802.11n. Changing to just 802.11g seems to help, although my card supports 'n'.\n\nA: Option 1: First open a web browser and in the address Bar type 192.168.2.1. This will open your router settings. From there click \"dns\" and change your dns to 8.8.8.8 and you secondary to 8.8.4.4. Which are Google's public dns servers. Now remember you will need to do this to each computer that is having issues.\nOption 2: From the router setup page Click on Channel & SSID. From there try changing channels (you may be receiving interference from a different router in your neighborhood). Should that not work try changing wireless mode to 802.11 G only.\nAgain remember that you will need to do this again on each computer with the issue.\nDon't forget as well to reboot the router from the router settings page labeled \"Restart Router\".\n\nA: what you need to do is to go to belkin website and chat with the web support and they solve your problem in 5 minutes. No much Technical knowledge is needed. OR you can follow the below steps too to get started in 2 minutes. I have done the same with me I am Ubuntu User\nPlease locate the reset hole on the router. The button will be on the back or side of the router. Use a paperclip (or something similar) to press and hold in the reset button for 10 to 20 seconds and then release it.\nNote: The router light will begin to blink. When the router light becomes solid again, the reset is complete.\nConnect your modem to the WAN port (Yellow) on your router.\nConnect the computer to one of the four LAN ports on the router.\nOpen a web browser [Mozilla firefox] and type 192.168.2.1 in the address bar and press Enter on your keyboard.\nClick on Login in the upper right-hand corner of the page. The router does not ship with an administrator password, so just click on Submit.\nOn left panel, click on Connection Type under Internet WAN and it will prompt for the Router password.\nBy default, there is no password set, so leave it blank and click on the Submit button.\nSelect the Connection Type as PPPoE and then click on Next.\nEnter the Username and Password provided by ISP, then click on Apply Changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the Internet Status on top right of Belkin Router Setup Page, it should say Connected.\n\n\nIf not, unplug the power cable of Router and Modem; leave it OFF for 30 Seconds.

If you wish to build an Architecture-All package only for x64, then you can simply modify the debian/control file, changing all instances of Architecture: all to Architecture: amd64; that way no i386 build will take place.\nIf you really need something built now, you could also change the urgency in the changelog to jump ahead in the queue, but one has to be mindful about misuse if this is purely a personal-type PPA build :)  IMO I would simply dpkg-buildpackage it if this was a one-off thing.\n", "Q: Can I use an alternative to upstart?

In order to do this.\nBasing from your screenshot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize column B in such that it has smaller width (desired width).\n\n*Set your selection tool to the column header (column B). You should select the entire column.\n\n*Right click it and format cells.\n\n*Go to Format Cells -> Alignment -> check wrap text automatically.\n\n\nThere you go. All entries that are wider enough to the desire width will be automatically wrapped. Once wrapped the LibreOffice Calc will automatically adjust it's height.\nAdded: If row height needs to be of the same height.\nIf you want to make your row height of the same height.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the rows (header, the one that has number).\n\n\n\n\n\n*Put your selection in between the separator of each row number.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Drag it and set the desired height.\n\n\n\n\nA: Open the file.  \nCtl+a to select all.  \nEither:\nA\nFormat -> Row -> Optimal Height\nOK  \nB\nFormat -> Row -> Height\nSet a height.\nYou could find the desired height by doing this same thing on the largest row and checking the value\n", "Q: Nautilus crashes after installing 'Nautilus Columns' I just installed Nautilus Columns (Nautilus extension) in Ubuntu 12.04 64bit and after installing it I can't open Nautilus it just Crashes/Closes when I try opening it.\nThis is the message I get from the command line when I run Nautilus :\n\nInitializing nautilus-ideviceinfo extension\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gobject/constants.py:24: Warning: g_boxed_type_register_static: assertion `g_type_from_name (name) == 0' failed\nimport gobject._gobject\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/arista-nautilus.py\", line 38, in\nimport nautilus\nImportError: No module named nautilus\nInitializing nautilus-dropbox 0.7.1\nTypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas because I would like to get this working.\n\nA: After a suggestion from another user named Andrew he suggested I uninstall Arista due to something in the output in the command I posted and the Nautilus and Nautilus-Columns worked fine together.

My sound setting looks like\n\nWhen I use the test dialog, only front left and right have sounds. If I use alsa in XBMC on a 5.1 video, there's no sound. If I use pulseaudio, only front right and left have sound. I can barely hear any speech since I'm guessing it's mapped to front center. Any clues?\nUpdate: on what I'm hearing on Ubuntu's IRC, I can't do 5.1 over HDMI and my best bet is to encode AC3 live over S/PDIF using A52 but I can't compile alsa-plugins... it gives an error somewhere while building oss. Any second opinions?\n\nA: I solved this by changing a couple of lines in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\nFirst, open the file for editing:\nsudo gedit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\n\nThen make sure the following line is uncommented and set to 6\ndefault-sample-channels = 6 \n\nalso uncomment and edit the following line to yes\nenable-lfe-remixing = yes\n\nThis enabled 5.1 audio on my Intel soundcard in 12.04\n\nA: Although I don't have 5.1 audio, I noticed that your alsamixer screen is showing settings for your Intel ALC892 audio and your second screenshot is trying to configure the sound through your HDMI port (Nvidia GT 520m). In order to switch the controls in alsamixer to your NVidia HDMI audio you have to press F6 (as it's written in the top right corner of alsamixer).\nIf everything is ok with the alsamixer settings and you still can't get any sound, I would try installing the paman package- Pulse Audio Manager. After you install it, open your console and write paman as the package is not installed with an menu entry. After you start the program you'll see 5 tabs - Server Information, Devices, Clients, Modules, Sample Cache. Go to the Devices tab. You'll see a list of Sinks and Sources. You should have 2 sinks by the way, one for your analog Intel output and one for the NVidia HDMI. At this point you should start your audio/video application that uses Pulse Audio for the output and that is configured to output 5.1 volume. Play a file that has a surround sound and you'll notice that new entry appears below one of your sinks in the form of #some_number (eg. #6) . If everything is configured properly in your audio/video application, the entry will appear below your HDMI sink entry. Click on the entry and press the properties button. A new panel appears. What you are trying to do whit all this is make sure that the volume is not set at 0%. Adjust the volume manually with the slider or press reset so that it's set at 100%. Also click on properties for the HDMI sink itself and check that the volume is also set at 100%.\nI don't know if this will help you, but it's worth trying it. I discovered Pulse Audio Manager 2 days ago while trying to solve a problem with a muted test sound in Skype- the test call was producing audio, while the test sound was completely silent. \n\nA: I ended solving this with the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In PulseAudio Manager (paman package), on the tab with the output devices, there's a list of compression methods like dts etc. I enabled all of them. \n\n*I connected the audio to the home theatre with S/PDIF.\n\n*In XBMC, I set the output to optical, the output device to PulseAudio and the passthrough device to PulseAudio as well\n\n\nAnd in 5.1 movies, it magically started playing in 5.1. Only one process can play sound at once but since I only use it for XBMC, it's not so bad.\n\nA: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall the linux-alsa-driver-modules package:\n\nsudo apt-get install linux-alsa-driver-modules-$(uname -r)\n\nNote: After installing the linux-alsa-driver-modules package, your system needs to be rebooted.\n\nA: This is the solution that worked for me and it solved my Microphone issues as well.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base\nsudo apt-get remove --purge pulseaudio\nsudo apt-get install alsa-base\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio\nsudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer\nsudo apt-get install indicator-sound\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\nReboot computer after this point.. you will get 5.1 surround sound. To test it type \nsudo speaker-test -c6\n\nOh and after you reboot if you don't hear surround sound you might need to type\nalsamixer\n\nand change the setting there from 2 channel ( ch2 ) to 6 channel ( ch6 ). You will even need to edit the daemon.conf file to set it there too.\ngksu gedit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\n\nChange the setting of  default-sample-channels = 2\nto : default-sample-channels = 6 ( This might be commented out with ; or #, uncomment it )\nYou might need to reboot a second time after you edit that file and setup the alsamixer to 6 channels.\nUPDATE : Keep in mind, before you reboot that second time, make sure in alsamixer that you chose the correct sound card. You can do that in alsamixer first then you can use the tiny indicator speaker from that point on after the 2nd reboot.\nEDIT UPDATE 2 : I reread your comments and realized just now that you are speaking about sending 5.1 over HDMI.

If the OS provides a driver for you, the driver will not always work the way it was intended. My wireless light flashes between blue and orange when I move my bluetooth mouse.

My netbook, an ASUS 1015PX, shipped with two harddrives. After switching to Ubuntu, the second drive isn't recognized by the OS or the BIOS. I've never formatted the second drive, so it's still set up for use by Windows. \nI guess I don't care about the data on the drive, I'd just like to be able to use it again. It's probably also worth mentioning that I'm very new to any form of Linux, so I'm remarkably new to the Terminal.\n\nA: You are mistaken. The official specifications for the Asus 1015PX show that it ships with only one hard-drive, which can be either 250/320/500GB.\n\nA: Express Gate can be rebuilt without Windows. I have done it on a friends Asus but cannot find the link to the instructions. You basically have to create a small (5GB?) partition and copy some files to it but it is probably too complex for you to do. Anyway Ubuntu boots up fast enough not to bother using it, especially if you use the suspend function.\n", "Q: Distorted and Choppy Audio After installing 12.04 Precise on my PC, I have encountered some problems with audio output which did no occur when using Lucid. \nThe sound is choppy and distorted in the lower tones.

Problem is I can still see the icon in the Dash.\nHow could I remove it completely from my system (for other apps too)?\n\nA: Dash picks up its entries from .desktop files placed in /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications.\nDeleting the .desktop file corresponding to your program should remove its entry from Dash.\n\nA: I had the same issue, this seems to be quite a common problem. Ubuntu should include a MENU editor by default.\nFirst I uninstalled the application, then I deleted all references from the following folder:\n/usr/share/applications\n/usr/local/share/applications\n~/.local/share/applications\n\nRebooted....but never resolved my issue.\nSo installed this MENU editor:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caldas-lopes/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ezame\n\nand delete unwanted icons.\n\nA: Actually, you should delete programs through Synaptic or Software center, but not simple by deleting the application folder.\nAlso, you can delete the application icon from the unity dashboard by right-clicking it and than clicking on the \"Unlock from Launcher\".\n", "Q: How to enable shutdown sound on ubuntu 12.04 LTS and up I need a sound to play when I shutdown. In Kubuntu, there's shutdown sound. But Ubuntu, not anymore\n\nA: The \"most simple\" way would be to automate this process with a small bash script.\nFirst, you need to take care of some dependencies by installing the mpg123 package, which can play mp3 files from the command line. You should be able to find similar packages for .ogg files as well.\nsudo apt-get install mpg123\n\nNext, you have to create the actual script that'll play the shutdown sound: (hint, you can replace pico with gedit if you don't feel comfortable editing files in the terminal. You can name the file whatever you want, but make sure you keep the K99 part in front of the file name for processing priority reasons.\nsudo pico /etc/init.d/K99shutdownsound.sh\n\nhere's the content of the script:\n#!/bin/sh\n## play shutdown sound\n/usr/bin/mpg123 /path/to/your/shutdown.mp3\n\nmake it executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/K99shutdownsound.sh\n\nNow you have to create a link from this script to /etc/rc0.d (where shutdown scripts go) and to /etc/rc6.d (where reboot scripts go)\nsudo ln -s /etc/init.d/K99shutdownsound.sh/etc/rc0.d/K99shutdownsound.sh\n\nsudo ln -s /etc/init.d/K99shutdownsound.sh /etc/rc6.d/K99shutdownsound.sh\n\nAnd now you have a shutdown sound. Just make sure you're not going to play a 5 minute mp3 file, since the system won't halt until it finishes streaming the file.\n\nA: What I used to do is have a file on my desktop called \"Startup.sh\" that would run a list of programs I like on startup. I discovered that when the last command in the list is playing a sound with mplayer it will do it right before shutdown OR logout. So, you need to download mplayer first:\nsudo apt-get install mplayer2\nThen, make a file called \"Startup.sh\" on your desktop. The text of the file should read something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nmplayer '[PATH TO SOUND FILE.extension]'\n\nYou just have to click that file every time you log in. You can add other startup programs you want to the script as well. \n", "Q: How do I install Cacti 8.7i with PIA 3.1(Plug In Architecture) for 12.04 Server LTS?

How can I downgrade a package to an older version via apt-get?\nOther tools are also acceptable but apt-get is preferred.\n\nA: If you have the version number, or the target release,  apt-get supports choosing a particular version or target release. More details can be found on manual page of apt-get. It can also be accessed from terminal by typing man apt-get\nsudo apt-get install <package-name>=<package-version-number>  OR\nsudo apt-get -t=<target release> install <package-name>\nis the command to be run. This can be used to down-grade a package to a specific version.\nRemark that when using a target release (option -t), the release priority must greater than 1000 to allow downgrades (see man 5 apt_preferences) otherwise the currently installed version will be kept.\nIt has been helpfully pointed out in the comments that\n\n*\n\n*apt-cache showpkg <package-name> lists all available versions. (h/t Sparhawk)\n\n*apt-mark hold <package-name>  \"holds\" the package at the current version, preventing automatic upgrades. (h/t Luís de Sousa )\n\n\nA: If you have upgraded software using ppa you can downgrade it by using ppa-purge. First you have to install ppa-purge using this code:\n\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nThen you can remove the ppa using command\n\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:user/ppa-name\n\nthis will automatically downgrade the software to its original version which shipped with Ubuntu.     \n\nA: Use:\napt-get install «pkg»=«version»\n\nor:\nsudo aptitude install «pkg»=«version»\n\nWhere:\n\n*\n\n*«pkg» is the name of the package.\n\n*«version» is the version number.\n\n\nA: In my opinion, you should first uninstall or purge the package, like:\nsudo apt-get remove <package>\n\nor\nsudo apt-get purge <package>\n\nThen, you may download the version you would like to install and keep it in a folder, say abc.deb in Downloads. Open terminal, move to the folder using cd command and install the previous version using dpkg:\nsudo dpkg -i abc.deb\n\nOr else, there is a small utility called ppa-purge if you mean to downgrade packages updated via PPAs. \nSee this thread: http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html\n\nA: To downgrade you have to do a command like\n sudo apt-get install pkg_name=version\n\nin your terminal.\nIn the place of version put the previous version you want to downgrade to.\n\nA: This question is old but Google led me here and I didn't find simple solution that does't require manual version passing when downgrading a bunch of packages to an older release.\nSo maybe someone who also needs that will find my solution useful as well.\nThere's a tool called apt-show-versions that shows versions installed. To install it:\n$ sudo apt install apt-show-versions\n\nMake sure APT's cache is up to date:\n$ sudo apt-show-versions -i\n\nYou can easily downgrade all required packages by fine-tuning the regex but here it is:\n$ sudo apt-get install $(apt-show-versions \\\n   | grep -P 'newer than version in archive' \\\n   | awk -F: '{print $1\"/'$(lsb_release -cs)'\"}')\n\nYou should have lsb-release installed for the latter.\n", "Q: Installation problem ubuntu 12.04 with hp Pavilion dv4 3006tx laptop I am trying to install ubuntu 12.04 in my laptop containing model is HP Pavilion dv4 3006 tx , it has 1GB Graphics card(\nVideo Graphics  AMD Radeon HD 6750M (1 GB DDR5) ).

Can some one tell me another way of turning on this program. \n\nA: Easiest way to check what is Ubuntu, is to record and image on CD and let the PC boot from CD when it is turned on. Then You will start so called Live Ubuntu, which is not installed on Your PC, so You can test it and see if You like it.\nMore info and download\n\nA: Ubuntu is an OS, and so it needs to be installed first on your computer. Or else, you can test-drive it on Live mode, that will get automatically started if you boot from the CD, DVD or any other installation medium. You can also download Unetbootin, a program that creates a pendrive with ubuntu installer loaded on it.\nSince you are new, I suggest you first run it live from CD, as misery said. You can also use Wubi, or WIndows Based Ubuntu Installer, which doesn't create any additional partition but just installs Ubuntu like any other program inside windows. Install it using Wubi and set your preferences such as username, password, how much space you want to give it, etc. and reboot. The boot menu will how you the option to boot into Ubuntu. \nBut this doesn't give you the full experience of Ubuntu, as the speed will be slightly less. \nAnd as for backtrack 5, it's another linux distro mainly aimed at breaking security etc. You will have to install it otherwise, to get full experience.

The second time it doesn't work anymore. So I'm doing it wrong. But what Am I doing wrong ?\n\nA: Here's a working example of what you want.\nYou need to grasp the concept of what the GTK main loop does to understand why it is important to separate GUI manipulation code from long blocking code. Hopefully, the comments and the debugging statements in my example will help you understand. This PyGTK FAQ entry is useful, and the concept applies to Python with GTK3 and GObject introspection as well.\nExample code:\nThis code creates a window with a simple button labelled \"Click me\". Once you click it, it will change to \"Working\", the cursor will become an hourglass, and the GUI will remain responsive. Once ten seconds have elapsed, the button label will change to \"Done\" and the cursor will return to normal.\nimport time\nimport threading\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, Gdk, GObject\n\nwindow = None\n\ndef main():\n    GObject.threads_init()\n    Gdk.threads_init()\n\n    # Build GUI:\n    global window\n    window = Gtk.Window()\n    button = Gtk.Button(label=\"Click me\")\n    window.add(button)\n    window.set_default_size(200, 200)\n    window.show_all()\n\n    # Connect signals:\n    window.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\n    button.connect(\"clicked\", on_button_click)\n\n    Gtk.main()\n\ndef on_button_click(button):\n    print \"Debug on_button_click: current_thread name:\", threading.current_thread().name\n\n    # This is a callback called by the main loop, so it's safe to\n    # manipulate GTK objects:\n    watch_cursor = Gdk.Cursor(Gdk.CursorType.WATCH)\n    window.get_window().set_cursor(watch_cursor)\n    button.set_label(\"Working...\")\n    button.set_sensitive(False)\n\n    def lengthy_process():\n        print \"Debug lengthy_process: current_thread name:\", threading.current_thread().name\n        # We're in a new thread, so we can run lengthy processes without\n        # freezing the GUI, but we can't manipulate GTK objects except\n        # through GObject.idle_add\n        time.sleep(10)\n        def done():\n            print \"Debug done: current_thread name:\", threading.current_thread().name\n            window.get_window().set_cursor(None)\n            button.set_label(\"Done!\")\n            return False\n        GObject.idle_add(done)\n\n    thread = threading.Thread(target=lengthy_process)\n    thread.start()\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n", "Q: What's the right way to make a backport recipe for bzr-builder? I maintain some packages in LP that I need to backport to oneiric, lucid and --- even --- hardy.\nFor example, my trunk branch builds correctly to precise and quantal, and I want to create a separate lucid-backport branch (not necessarily a fork of trunk) which only contains the modified debian/control and debian/compat files needed for the backport to lucid. Then I like to write a bzr-builder recipe to combine both branches someway.\nWhat's the right way to do this?\n\nA: If your packaging is part of the base branch rather than in a nested branch, you could probably use the merge d in your recipe.\nSimply branch your of your package, make your Lucid compatibility changes and commit them.  Now you can write a recipe something like:\n# bzr-builder ...\nlp:.../base-packaging-branch\nmerge lucid-backport lp:.../lucid-compat-packaging\n\nYou should now get all the changes from the base branch with your Lucid compatibility fixes layered on top.

In every other way it should behave like a regular Ubuntu installation.\nThe problem\nWith Startup Disk Creator one is able to put the LiveCD image on a USB-device. Changes can be made persistent but are stored in a file that is limited to a few GB in size. Said persistent file (additionally to being size restricted) has the problem that it isn't readable like data on a normal partition.*\nMy question\nSo how do I get the LiveCD on a USB disk in such a way that the changes are stored in a normal partition rather than a persistence file? Also the persistent changes shouldn't be restricted to a few GB in size but use whole partition of many 100 GB if need be.\nI suspect there is a tutorial out there for this, but my google-fu is just not good enough to find it.\ntl;dr:\nSytem should run on all hardware configurations, have full functionality of the LiveCD and be stored on a regular ext4 partiton without using ramdisks and casper-rw. FU casper-rw.\n\n*I know one could mount the casper-rw file from another OS and get to the data this way but that's a hassle.\n\nA: Persistent partitions have not worked with syslinux type installs such as SDC, UNetbootin, Rufus, etc since 14.04, (unless the partition is located on a separate drive). An attempt boot will end with BusyBox.\nSyslinux 6.03 offers full support for NTFS, (and many other fs), so there is no longer a 4GB persistent file size limit required to satisfy FAT32. YUMI uses Syslinux 6.03 as does RUFUS. \nhttps://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/ \nhttps://rufus.akeo.ie/\nMkusb is a grub2 type bootable flash drive maker that uses a FAT32 partition for boot, a write only ISO9660 partition for the OS, a ext4 casper-rw partition for persistence and a NTFS data partition accessible to both Linux and Windows. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nIt should satisfy your specification.\n\nA: This is very easy to do, although the \"casper-rw\" name will still show up once :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Your target USB disk must have at least two partitions; I recommend using GParted to create a new partition table.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first partition must be vfat/FAT32, and minimum size 750 MB (or more if you are using a live DVD image).\n\n*The second partition should be ext4, sized to whatever you want your persistent storage to be (no limits), but it must be labeled casper-rw (all lower case, no quotes)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can, of course, add third, fourth, extended/logical partitions, etc. if you would like to.\n\n\n\nNote: I prefer to use UNetbootin because it makes editing the syslinux configuration easy. You can use your own USB creator, but you should then modify the below steps appropriately. Also note that GParted 0.18.0 seems to have problems partitioning the USB stick. So if you have the issue then use live GParted CD for partitioning.\n\n\n*Use UNetbootin to write your chosen live CD ISO to the first (vfat) USB partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Put a tiny size for UNetbootin's persistence option (say, 10 MB) to make life easier; don't worry, we won't actually be using this casper-rw file.\n\n\n\n\n*Once everything is done, the final step is to delete the small casper-rw file created on the vfat partition you installed the live CD on, so that the large ext4 casper-rw partition is used instead. Mount this partition (here, sdb1), and delete /casper-rw.\n\n*Persistence (via the persistent kernel option) should already be set up if you used UNetbootin, so safely eject the USB and you're ready to go!\nPS: If you don't want to use UNetbootin and you are using the \"Startup disk creator\" in Ubuntu then you need to do some edits to your syslinux/txt.cfg file as follows:\n\ndefault live\nlabel live\n  menu label ^Try Ubuntu without installing\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent noprompt floppy.allowed_drive_mask=0 ignore_uuid initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nlabel live-install\n  menu label ^Install Ubuntu\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper only-ubiquity cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent noprompt floppy.allowed_drive_mask=0 ignore_uuid initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nlabel check\n  menu label ^Check disc for defects\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi\n  append  boot=casper integrity-check cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent noprompt floppy.allowed_drive_mask=0 ignore_uuid initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nlabel memtest\n  menu label Test ^memory\n  kernel /install/mt86plus\nlabel hd\n  menu label ^Boot from first hard disk\n  localboot 0x80\n\n\nA: For what it is worth the following is how I make a Persistent flash drive:\nBoot Live CD or Live USB.\nPlug in flash drive.\nStart gparted.\nCreate 2 GB FAT32 partition, (on the left side of the bar).

If I click on an application's icon to run it, it appears after 10 seconds and sometimes does not appear at all. It hangs all the time. The cursor is almost impossible to follow because of the lag.\nI have read on the Internet that Unity uses more memory and CPU than KDE. But on my PC Unity runs smoothly and KDE does not.\nSo what should I do to make KDE as fast, responsive and smooth as Unity?\nMy specifications are as follows:\nRAM: 1.5 GB (DDR2)\nProcessor: 3 GHz Dual Core\nGraphics Card: Intel HD graphics with 256 MB memory.  \n\nA: Install kubuntu-low-fat-settings and it will make a big difference. You will loose desktop effects and other non-essential services will be disabled, this is a fair trade-off for less powerful computers.\n\nA: The package kubuntu-low-fat-settings is very good start, indeed.\nIf you want some additional manual tweak and fix on slow startup or Youtube slowness, try this (some of them are performed by the above package, others not):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install KDE backports PPA.

The app has got a toolbar with a dark background, and each toolbar button has got a custom image (i.e. no stock icons are used).\nI've noticed that when using stock icons instead of custom images as icons, whenever the mouse hovers over the button the button is highlighted, which does not happen with my custom images.\nThunderbird seems to go a step further and rather than highlighting the icons, it inverts their color, which works quite well for a dark theme (see below):\nButton not highlighted, normal color\n\nButton highlighted on hover, color inverted\n\nHow can I get my custom icon images or the buttons to be highlighted on hover?\n\nA: The issue is a problem with the Ambiance theme. There is a highlight, but the background color for the prelight is darker. If thunderbird is showing a light highlight and inverting the colors of the icons, then it is because it's using custom widgets in XUL (which isn't Gtk+), which aren't following the GTK+ or icon themes, for everything.\n", "Q: Can't boot into ubuntu.

Past this point, it makes giant leaps all the way up to 100% when volume is on full.\nAlsamixer, however, shows this perfectly. The 'master' bar stays at zero until the normal   volume setting is past 3/4, so it's measuring actual volume perfectly.

In Ubuntu I have faced the segmentation fault error many times. What is a segmentation fault and when does it occur?\n\nA: Segmentation fault is caused by a bug in the application. Technically it means that application try to read or write to part of memory that doesn't belongs to it (or doesn't exist). It's of course forbidden to read or write to somebody else's memory and when system (kernel) detects this, it will force the application to quit.\n\nA: An error saying segmentation fault (or segfault, or SIGSEGV) in Ubuntu and other Unix-like operating systems, or saying general protection fault in Windows, is when a program attempts to access a part of memory that cannot be accessed, or which the program is prohibited from accessing. A segmentation fault is a kind of program crash, that is, an abnormal termination of a program. See the Wikipedia articles on crashes, memory protection, segmentation fault, general protection fault, and SIGSEGV for more information (and a more textured understanding of the topic than is presented here).\nA segmentation fault is almost always due to a bug in the program where it occurs. I am guessing most or all of your segmentation faults are happening from the same application. Please provide more details about the circumstances under which segmentation faults are happening on your machine, and what program is crashing. Please also provide the full and exact text of the error message you're receiving and any other messages that appear before it. This should make it possible for us to provide detailed advice specific to your problem (rather than just general information about what a segmentation fault is).\nThe best way for you to provide this information is for you to edit your question to include it. Alternatively, if you want this question to be just about segmentation faults in general, you could post a new question to ask about what specifically is causing your segmentation faults (if you do this, make sure to provide all these details in your new question).\n\nA: Gone are the days when people used to trace through assembly code and debug a problem. Abends, Dr Watson, Segmentation fault. Those green days are gone.\nOne of the reasons for a segmentation fault is when code that has direct access to memory fails. When a piece of code tries to access the memory segment of a different application, segmentation fault occurs. Memory allocations are some times moved around to allow larger contiguous blocks of memory to get allocated. While it tries to recover, the kernel tries hard to save all its memory information to a file, current state of all applications running on the cpu and their state (last instruction run) to a file and just die.

There are 3 different commands in Quickly to release a new version of an app into a PPA\n\n\n*\n\n*release - Posts a release of your project to a PPA on launchpad so that users can install the application on their system.\n\n*share - Updates your PPA with the the latest saved project changes.\n\n*submitubuntu - Posts a release of your project and submit it the ubuntu\napplication review board so that any users can see and install the\napplication ont their system.\nEven after reading the help, I cannot figure out when or if I should use each one of them.\nSo what are the main differences between these commands and when should I use each one?\n\nA: *\n\n*share - This command lets you share your current developmental snapshot of your product. You should be using this command if you have added minor features or fixed bugs in your application.\n\n*release - This command allows you to create a new release of your application. You should be using this command if you have added major features to indicate that it has undergone some significant improvements. \n\n*submitubuntu - It is as obvious as the name can be. It allows you to release the project that you are working on as well as submit it to the Ubuntu application board for reviewing. If you are looking to get your application into the software-center, this command should make things a zillion times easier, as it prepares the package to install in the /opt directory, as required by the Ubuntu App Review Board. \n\nA: Those three commands are intended as three levels of \"officialness\" to your release.\nshare\nshare does 2 main things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Packages your software with a version suffix like -public1\n\n*Uploads that package to a PPA\n\n\nSo it's good for quickly getting code to testers.  Ideally you'd use a separate PPA from your normal releases.\nrelease\nrelease does the same thing as share except:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updates your version with a real version number like 12.04 (or whatever number you provide)\n\n*Saves your changes to bzr and tags it with the version number\n\n*Pushes a tarball of your release to your Launchpad project page\n\n\nSo it's good for releasing a version of your software that is ready for prime time.\nsubmitubuntu\nsubmitubuntu does the same thing as release except:\n\n\n*\n\n*The PPA package of your software will be setup to make it easier for the App Review Board to accept (installs your software in /opt, adds certain metadata flags, etc)\n\n\nSo this is good for releasing a version of your software that you also intend to submit to the ARB.  Note that this does not automatically submit it.  It just makes packaging changes to make the ARB process quicker once you do.  You will then need to point the ARB to the PPA into which you uploaded.\nIf you just want to test those packaging changes (like /opt), but without actually releasing, use quickly package --extras.\n", "Q: How do I change my timezone to UTC/GMT?

From here on, you can simply type \"Alt [to invoke HUD] + CW\" and it should pull up the first choice as \"File > Close Window\".

It got me thinking on how, for example I can update my Intel motherboard via an burned ISO image that carries the update and other ways to apply firmwares to different types of hardware. But since not all are that easy to upgrade, what applications or terminal ways are available in Ubuntu to apply firmware updates to different hardware that only offer the update via Windows.\nCases like motherboard, hard drive (SSD specially since I will receive my first SDD next month), video cards, etc.. What are some of the ways to update hardware firmware in Ubuntu.\nFor this question I am incline to skip smartphones/cellphones since they have a different way of doing it. I want to focus on internal hardware and some external common ones, like the webcam I mentioned, printers (if they happen to have firmware updates) and other common computer hardware.\nNote that there is no specific brand for a hardware. the question is looking for what ways in Ubuntu are available to update the firmware of common hardware, including but not limited to for example burning an ISO image of a firmware updater. But for other cases that do not offer an ISO image, what ways exist to update the firmware.\n\nA: There is no common method of updating device firmware; it is entirely up to the manufacturer to do so in a proprietary and usually secret way.  In other words, you have to use whatever method each manufacturer supplies for their device, which generally is either windows software, or a dos boot disk.\nThe one near exception to this is hard disks ( and other ata devices ) because the ata standard does provide a command to update firmware, and hdparm supports uploading firmware with this command in theory, but I have yet to see a drive maker actually supply the raw firmware image that you could use with hdparm.\n", "Q: Why does Kmail make JPG files larger when I forward them? When I forward emails with JPEG attachments inline, the JPEG files size enlarge. Is this normal? Can I turn it off?\n\nA: \nWhen I forward emails with JPEG attachments inline, the JPEG files size enlarge. Is this normal?\n\nYes. E-mail standards require that emails consists only of text; JPEG files are binary data. The inline images must first be converted into text, which increases their size. These are converted back into binary JPEG data at the recipient's end. \n\nCan I turn it off?\n\nNo.\n\nThe Base64 Wikipedia article has more technical information and examples if you are interested in one of the most common ways this conversion takes place -- this one increases sizes by approximately 33%.\n", "Q: Wine 1.5 Error Ubuntu 12.04 I installed a program with Wine 1.5, but when I try to open it I get the following error\n\nThe program (A2J Author) is a program written in flash.

I did this 3 times and it worked beautifully. Then suddenly it didn't work anymore! How on earth can this be possible?!\nI know potentially 1000 things can be wrong when WOL doesn't work but the fact it worked 3 consecutive times rules out most of them. It worked 3 times (a few minutes apart) and after that has never worked. During the 3 times it worked and the followingh 10 unsuccessful tries the only thing I fiddled with was the firewall on the PC that sends the magic packets, and I soon switched the firewall off to eliminate that potential problem, and also verified the packets come through with wireshark (with the Ubuntu machine on then of course). I made a full update of Ubuntu a few hours before the tests started.\nMost of the time I feel like I'm just testing various things blindly. Is there for example any way to check that power isn't shut down for the NIC? And doesn't the \"cat /proc/acpi/wakeup\" being \"disabled\" mean something's wrong?\nThere's lots of threads on WOL, I know, but none where it works perfectly for 10 minutes then stops working for no reason. A few threads mention problems with WOL after 12.04 was installed. My only remaining idea right now is to install Ubuntu 10. But that would just be a test, not a permanent solution, and a very time consuming test. And I'm sure RTL8111/RTL8168 isn't properly supported on older Ubuntus (there have been major problems with those NICs with older Ubuntus) which complicates such a test even more.\n\nYou should only have to read the text above to understand my problem. But for in-depth info, here are some facts and tests I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried adding \"pci=noacpi\", \"pci=noapic\", \"acpi=force\" and \"apm=on apm=power-off\" to /etc/default/grub (and I verified the changes in grab.cfg). One at a time of course (reboot after each).\n\n*I saw the NIC was disabled in cat /proc/acpi/wakeup, enabled it with command \"echo -n LAN | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup\" and now LAN was enabled in the list\n\n*Firewalls are disabled\n\n*ethtool shows wol is in state \"g\" (I tried setting it to \"pumbag\", and also to \"d\" then \"g\").\n\n*It is an ASUS board with Realtek RTL1111/R8168B (driver R8169 came with the kernel and it was with that driver is worked 3 times; lately I changed to driver R8168 which wasn't easy but I can't see any difference and people seem to report R8169 should be used for all nowadays).\n\n*I also tried using wireshark on the Ubuntu machine to verify the magic packets got through to the PC\n\n*Tried resetting CMOS RAM (both by jumper and removing battery for 5 minutes).\n\n*NIC LED is not lit when in sleep but it's also not lit on my other PC when in sleep and WOL works for that PC.\n\n*I tried enabling \"Wake on when hit PS/2 spacebar\" in BIOS, started Ubuntu, selected \"Standby\" from menu so that it got into standby, pressed spacebar, and it started. Also worked after Terminal command pm-suspend and halt -p (shuts down and reboots completely though) but does not wake after command halt. Halt makes the OS shut down but the HW to remain on. Still ignoring WOL in all cases.\n\n*When in standby the power LED blinks, fans and hard disk are silent, and this remains the same after WOL attempts\n\n*Program used for sending magic packets is: magicpacket(dot)free(dot)fr on a different (Windows) PC\n\n*Settings for Magic Packet sender is UDP port 80 subnet mask 255.255.255.255 and that's the settings it worked with but I also tried ports 9, 7 and 0, TCp and mask 0.0.0.0. Have double checked MAC address but I entered it via copy-and-paste and it has worked with these settings 3 times as I mentioned.\n\n*I have only used Ubuntu for a week (have some brief experience with Linux and Unix systems from long ago)\n\n*I haven't added \"ethtool -s eth0 wol g\" (or \"echo -n LAN | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup\") to startup scripts since I believe WOL should work ONCE if these things are set properly (script are needed to make it work after each reboot)\nThe motherboard Asus AT5NM10T-I has no BIOS updates (is v0306)\nTried most things on these pages:\nwiki.ubuntuusers.de/Wake_on_LAN --\nen.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/ACPI/Fix_common_problems#Nothing_Works --\nwiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Enable_Wake-On-Device_for_Ubuntu\n\n\n\nUpdates:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes I have enabled \"Power on by PME\" (PCI Power Management Events) in BIOS. I also enabled \"Power on by Ring\" since someone suggested that in a forum but I can't believe it affects WOL but also can't hurt. Since it worked 3 rimes this is no BIOS settings problem.\n\n*I actually tried reinstalling Ubuntu 12.04, and again it worked 3 times then after that is dead. (Actually this time it worked 1 time, then didn't work, then worked 2 times in a row, then never again.) --- Some details on this new test which probably have no significance: It didn't work until I enabled Samba properly for file sharing between PCs in a workgroup. The 3 times it worked I did not have to send sudo ethtool -s eth0 wol g (sudo ethtool eth0 always reports it is in wol mode \"g\" so apparently my NIC starts in that mode). And sudo cat /proc/acpi/wakeup now always shows LAN as \"enabled\" now. This time I used the downloaded 12.04 without updates (Ubuntu's desktop said there were no updates), later (long after it stopped working) it said there were 136 updates, I installed them and rebnooted, still didn't work.\n\n*Apparently this NIC has been troublesome for Linux users for years, but I thought it was working properly since recently, with the driver that comes with the kernel. It isone of the most common NICs I think.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tested with Ubuntu 11.10. It has the same problems, or a version of it: WOL seems to work about 1 out of 4 times. Doesn't suddenly stop working, just doesn't work every time (far from it).\n\n*Tested with Windows 7. Installed Realtek driver. Ticked \"allow only magic packet to wake up\" in NIC settings (HW manager) and it worked flawlessly, tested 5 times in a row. Note: First I didn't bother to install video and audio drivers and then only hibernation worked, but it did respond to WOL calls flawlessly. Installed video and audio driver plus \"PC Probe II\" which seems to have something to do with ACPI driver. Did this after I read in Wikipedia on ACPI that Windows might not allow standby (S3) if one device in the system doesn't support acpi.\n\n*When in sleep mode (or hibernation) in Windows, I can still see this unit in the router's list of attached devices (but the LED on the NIC is out). (As I said before, for a different PC, it is not seen in this list even though WOL works, so apparently this isn't always the case). For this PC, however, it might indicate that the NIC hasn't any power, i e that the problem here is that Ubuntu shuts down the NICs power.\n\n*I forgot to mention my machines are all 64 bit. It is not so uncommon that 32 bit drivers work while 64 bit drivers don't. So one suspicion is that the 64 bit Realtek driver still doesn't work properly on Linux with RTL8111 etc - I know there's been problems with these NICs for years which I read were solved rather recently, but can anyone confirm they have RTL8111/RTL8168&RTL8168B etc working with WOL on a 64 bit machine?\n\n\nSo my main theories for now are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu system shuts down NIC power in standby mode?\n\n*Realtek driver for 64-bit machines does not work?\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.

The only thing I can think of is get a 12.04 Live CD and click 'Upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04' option, but for reasons I won't go into this is impractical for me.\n\nA: You don't have to, and you shouldn't, uninstall python2.7 to install python3. You can have both packages installed at the same time. Many parts of Ubuntu require python2.7. Reinstall the packages you've uninstalled, and that should fix the problem. If you're having a problem installing python3 while python2.7 is installed, or you are having trouble getting python code to run in python3 instead of python2.7, please edit your question to include the relevant details.\nIf you're not sure which python2.7 related packages you removed, you can look in the log files that start with dpkg and are located in /var/log. If the removal operations were pretty recent, you can just look in /var/log/dpkg itself (i.e., the file called just dpkg and located in the /var/log folder).\n\nA: I think many applications have strong dependencies with Python 2.7. But you can install Python 3 without uninstalling Python 2.7.\nSo, if you can login in text mode, just type this in order to install Python 2.7:\nsudo apt-get install python\n\nThen you can reboot your computer:\nsudo reboot\n\nIf I understand you, you have Python 3 installed.

So basically, I'd like to use iwconfig to connect to my wifi network when I'm not inside X. But I just don't see a way to do it in the man page. Any idea?\n\nA: This link shows it all and worked fine for me: http://linux.icydog.net/wpa.php\nI'm copying the contents here, so we have it, in case that site goes offline.\nCommand line WPA\nSometimes you'll be at a command line with no access to GUI networking tools -- but your access point is secured with WPA. What do you do?\nAssuming your wireless card actually works (i.e. iwconfig can see it and interact with it), using wpa_supplicant is actually pretty simple.\nInstalling wpa_supplicant\nMost distros nowadays have wpa_supplicant installed by default. If you have the commands wpa_passphrase and wpa_supplicant available, then you're good to go. Otherwise, you will need to install the package by doing something like (for Ubuntu):\n$ sudo apt-get install wpasupplicant\n\nOr (for Fedora):\n# yum install wpa_supplicant\n\nOr whatever the command is for your distro.\nGenerating the config file\nNow that wpa_supplicant is installed, we will create its configuration file. Once you know the SSID and WPA passphrase, all you have to do is run:\n$ wpa_passphrase myrouter mypassphrase > wpa.conf\n\nOf course, replace \"myrouter\" with the SSID of your router, \"mypassphrase\" with your WPA passphrase, and \"wpa.conf\" with whatever file you want to store the configuration in. This filename does not have to follow a particular format or have a particular extension.\nAlternatively, to avoid typing the passphrase on the command line (so it doesn't get saved in the shell's history), you can specify just the SSID on the command line. wpa_passphrase will wait for you to type in the passphrase followed by enter:\n$ wpa_passphrase myrouter > wpa.conf\nmypassphrase\n\nYou should end up with a file looking like this:\nnetwork={\n    ssid=\"myrouter\"\n    #psk=\"mypassphrase\"\n    psk=8ada1f8dbea59704ac379538b4d9191f6a72390581b4cd7a72864cea685b1a7f\n}\n\nGetting connected\nNow we will actually run wpa_supplicant to connect to the wireless network. First, if your router broadcasts its SSID (they all do by default), you probably want to make sure your wireless card can actually see it:\n$ iwlist scan\n\nYou might have to run that as root to force a refresh.\nNext, you will need to know three pieces of information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which wpa_supplicant wireless drivers to use for your card. Running wpa_supplicant --help lists the different drivers it has (under \"drivers:\"). As of 0.5.8, the useful choices are: wext, hostap, madwifi, atmel, ndiswrapper, and ipw (ipw is for old kernels only; >=2.6.13 should use wext). If you don't see a specific match for your card, try wext, as that's kind of the catch-all.\n\n*The network device of your card. This is usually eth1 or wlan0, but if you're unsure you can just run iwconfig. It will report \"no wireless extensions\" for non-wireless devices and will display some data for any wireless devices.\n\n*The path to the configuration file that you created in the previous step.\n\n\nNow that you have this data, run (as root):\n# wpa_supplicant -D[driver] -i[device] -c[/path/to/config]\n\nThere are no spaces between the options and parameters. Don't include the brackets as I just added those for clarity. For example, for my laptop it looks like this:\n# wpa_supplicant -Dwext -ieth1 -c/root/wpa.conf\n\nYou can also run it in the background by using the -B option so that it doesn't take up your console.\nNow you're associated with the network.\nGetting online\nTo actually get online, you'll have to get an IP somehow. Most people will just want to get a dynamic IP from a DHCP server, probably the one built into the router. (I'm not going to cover setting a static IP and routing table because that's a beast in itself.)\nTo get a DHCP lease, first release whatever leases you're still holding onto (as root):\n# dhclient -r\n\nThen ask for a new lease (of course replacing eth1 with the name of your network device, the same one as you used in the previous section):\n# dhclient eth1\n\nYou now have an IP, in theory at least. Happy surfing!\n\nA: All the answers suggesting wpa_supplicant are wrong. Yes, it may connect you to the WPA network, but that's a bad solution in the long run because it'll be very difficult to maintain and won't play nicely with a wired connection. Read this answer and make your life easier by using Network Manager from the command line. I wasted hours trying to configure wpa_supplicant, then tried nmcli and it \"just worked\".\n\nA: First brig your card up if it's not runnig:\nifconfig wlan0 up\n\nSet the parameters acording to your network\niwlist wlan0 scan\niwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_ID key WIRELESS_KEY\n\n\nA: There's actually a way to do it using NetworkManager, if you have the checkbox package installed.\nsudo /usr/share/checkbox/create_connection SSID --security=wpa -key=WPA-KEY\n\n(Credit: bug 923836, which came up in my searches on the topic.)\n\nA: You can use VSWM - Very Simple Wireless Manager. You place your known APs on a simple cfg file (/etc/vswm.cfg) and when you run vswm it scan the networks available and connect your card with the first that appears on /etc/vswm.cfg.\nVSWM is available at https://github.com/dmelo/vswm . Here is a pick of how the vswm.cfg config file looks like:\n[global]\n\ndev = wlan0\ndns = [\"4.2.2.1\",\"8.8.8.8\"]\n\n[wlan0-0]\n\nssid = Network1\npsk = netpassword\nprotocol = WPA\nnet = dhcp\n\n[wlan0-1]\n\nssid = Network2\nprotocol = WEP\nnet = static\naddress = 192.168.0.15/24\n\nUnder the hoods, it uses the standard command line tools: iwlist, wpa_supplicant, iwconfig, dhclient... Only it automates the job.\n\nA: The nmcli is the command line version of the default network manager app on Ubuntu.  \nSome of the advantages are that it uses the configuration you already have from the graphical interface and it doesn't need root access.    \nYou can run nmcli to show the available options. \nExample to connect to a wifi named MYESSID:     \n    nmcli c up MYESSID   \n\n\nA: Debian and other distros have wpa_suplicant running as a service by default in order to manage the wifi networks. wpa_suplicant can be handled by different clients/front-ends such as the network manager GUI. This is better explained in this debian wiki.\nwpa_cli is the command line wpa_suplicant client to manage the wifi networks.\nEdit: I have just found this post explaining how to use nmcli and it is much better than wpa_cli since it is compatible with the GUI Network Manager and their settings and saved wifi networks. \nExample of use of wpa_cli:\nCheck that I already have a wifi enabled network interface:\n# iwconfig\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any  \n          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=22 dBm   \n          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Encryption key:off\n          Power Management:on\n\nCheck if wpa_suplicant process is running:\n# ps -e | grep wpa\n1881 ?        00:00:07 wpa_supplicant\n\nEnter in wpa client interactive mode:\n# wpa_cli\n\nList available access points:\n> scan\n> scan_results\n\n... and you get something like this:\nbssid / frequency / signal level / flags / ssid\ne0:60:66:7c:81:7f       2417    -66     [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][ESS]    vodafone817E\ne0:60:66:61:83:4b       2452    -76     [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS]       vodafone834A\nf8:8e:85:c5:65:c2       2462    -76     [WPA-PSK-CCMP+TKIP][WPS][ESS]   MOVISTAR_65C1\na8:d3:f7:46:0c:be       2472    -83     [WPA-PSK-CCMP+TKIP][WPA2-PSK-CCMP+TKIP][WPS][ESS]       Orange-0CBC\n...\n\nAdd your AP:\n> add_network\n> set_network 0 ssid \"vodafone817E\"\n> set_network 0 psk \"my-pass-phrase\"\n\nSelect it as current:\n> enable_network 0\n\nConnect to it:\n> reconnect\n\nCheck the status:\n> status\n\nExit wpa_cli:\n> quit\n\nFrom the shell, request DHCP for an IP and net settings:\n# dhclient -r\n# dhclient wlan0\n\n\nA: iw (list/config) can only handle WEP.\nYou need the wpasupplicant package which provides the wpa_supplicant command, install if necessary through sudo apt-get install wpasupplicant.\nYou put your SSID and password into /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf (requires sudo).\nExample:\nnetwork={\n    ssid=\"ssid_name\"\n    psk=\"password\"\n}\n\nAssuming your interface is wlan0 you can connect with:\nsudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -D wext\nsudo dhclient wlan0\n\n\"wext\" is a driver and that will be specific for each card; refer to wpa_supplicant -h.

My network ID and password generated errors when I used the wpa_supplicant.conf file on the wpa_supplicant command line, e.g.\nsudo wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B\n\nI was able to work around it with wpa_cli. The command sequence I had to use, since I am using a Windows driver with Linux ndiswrapper, is:\nsudo modprobe ndiswrapper\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 essid \"<My Network ID>\" mode managed\nsudo wpa_cli identity \"<My Network ID>\" password \"<My password>\"\n\nI had the network set up by adding it in the wireless section of networking in the GUI, so \nthat I could click on the wired or wireless network icon and select the wireless provider \n(which was sometimes necessary to complete the login).\n", "Q: Is there a version of Chrome or Chromium whose bookmarks are visible to the HUD? I noticed that Firefox has bookmarks that can be executed in the HUD. Love it! \nChrome and Chromium, which run javascript apps much faster for some odd reason, allow for history to be called through the HUD, but not bookmarks. This wouldn't be a problem if ALL history was callable, but it seems that Chrome LIMITS the amount of history visible to the hud. \nIs there a version of chrome or chromium that will see our bookmarks? \n\nA: Earlier versions of Chromium did have the bookmarks and full history exposed to the application menu and the HUD.  The Chromium developers felt that Dbusmenu's implementation slowed their startup time too much, so they disabled it.  \nSince then we've drastically improved the speed of Dbusmenu requests, so it shouldn't be an issue, but someone needs to work with them to restore the feature in Chromium.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.chromium.org/for-testers/bug-reporting-guidelines/\n\nA: The HUD (at least in 12.04) simply provides access to the same items provided in the menus at the top of the application. (The menus accessed by moving the mouse to the top panel.)\nIn Firefox, there is a Bookmarks menu - this means your bookmarks are also accessible through the HUD.\nIn Chromium, there is no Bookmarks menu.

I'd like to start my music player (Clementine) when my bluetooth headset connects to my computer. How do I detect the bluetooth device connecting so I can run a script to start the player?\n\nA: To discover a successfully established Bluetooth connection we can run\nsdptool browse xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\nBy this the SDB connection will be tested for a connection to the given MAC address. It may take considerable time until browsing times out with an error like\nFailed to connect to SDP server on 00:0C:78:4F:B6:B5: Host is down\n\nWe don't know the exact purpose of your script, but most likely you wish to play audio via Clementine when a headset was connected.\nThen we could just see whether there is a Bluetooth audio sink with\npacmd list-sinks | grep xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx\n\nWhere xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx is the MAC address (: needs to be replaced with _). The output will then tell you whether there is a Bluetooth audio sink available or nothing if not.\nSee this answer on how to switch audio to this sink.\n\nStream2ip\nWith stream2ip we can define a shell command or a script to run after a connection was established. There also is an option to automatically start a supported media player after a connection was established:\n\nStream2ip will also try to reconnect the currently running playback stream to the Bluetooth audio device in case the connection was interrupted.\n\nA: @Erigami Your answer helped a lot but to make it work I'd to do some changes. I'm using ubuntu 14.04.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport dbus\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop\nimport gobject\n\nimport subprocess\n\n# ID of the device we care about\nDEV_ID = 'CC:C3:EA:A5:16:90'.replace(\":\", \"_\")\n\ndbus_loop = DBusGMainLoop()\nbus = dbus.SystemBus(mainloop=dbus_loop)\n\n# Figure out the path to the headset\nman = bus.get_object('org.bluez', '/')\niface = dbus.Interface(man, 'org.bluez.Manager')\nadapterPath = iface.DefaultAdapter()\n\nprint(adapterPath + '/dev_' + DEV_ID)\nheadset = bus.get_object('org.bluez', adapterPath + '/dev_' + DEV_ID)\n# ^^^ I'm not sure if that's kosher.

It does not need to specify a specific MAC address. This approach makes the xinput setting persistent even when login/out, suspend/wake and connect/dis-connect your bluetooth device.\nI have a Thinkpad compact Bluetooth Keyboard, and I wish to run an xinput command whenever the keyboard is connected to adjust the speed of trackpoint. Here are the steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download code from Github bluetooth-ruunner. Credits given to here who first wrote this for Raspberry Pi. Modify the following section of the code to run your custom comamnds.\nsubprocess.call(['xinput', 'set-prop',\n                 'ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with TrackPoint',\n                 'Device Accel Constant Deceleration', '0.6'])\n\nIn my case, this is equivalent to calling from the terminal.\n$ xinput set-prop 'ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with TrackPoint' 'Device Accel Constant Deceleration' 0.6\n\n\n*Save the modification. Try running your scripts by\n$ python bluetooth-runner.py\n\nConnect and disconnect your Bluethooth device. You should see the corresponding message printed on screen.\n\n*Now, make your file executable and copy it in one of the directory in your $PATH, say ~/bin/.\n$ chmod +x bluetooth-runner.py\n$ mkdir ~/bin # if you dont have it yet\n$ cp bluetooth-runner.py ~/bin\n\n\n*Now, make sure you can run the script from anywhere in the terminal (make sure it is in your search path).\n\n*Fire up the Startup Applications from the ubuntu menu. Add your scripts to the startup.\n\n\n*Now, there is only one problem left, at the time when you login, the scripts might not catch the very first bluetooth event. This is because your bluetooth device might be connected before your script is initialized in the background. \nTo solve this, add your custom command directly in Startup Applications. In my case, it is the follow command:\n xinput set-prop 'ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with TrackPoint' 'Device Accel Constant Deceleration' 0.6\n\nAnd now you shall be able to enjoy your Bluetooth device with Ubuntu.\n\nA: You write \"when your headset connects to your computer\". How does it do that, automatically? When you have to trigger it manually, you might as well make it a script and then run your script after the connection has been established. This is what I did to set the default output device to my bluetooth receiver (so I can change the volume with the hardware keys):\nbluetooth-connect && pactl set-default-sink bluez_sink.0C_A6_94_9A_37_4D\n\nWhere bluetooth-connect looks like this: https://github.com/sblask/dotfiles/blob/c39d37ad67947b358b4a079cb41ae6f9e4a081d8/.bin/bluetooth-connect.symlink It assumes everything has been paired and is ready to connect. You find the MAC address in blueman or by running pacmd list-sinks | grep -e 'name:' -e 'index' when the bluetooth device is connected. You would want run bluetooth-connect && your-script. your-script will only be run when the connection was established successfully.\n\nA: If none of the previous solutions worked for you for any reason, I wrote a Python script using pydbus package. dbus-python as in @Erigami, @Hitul and @Yixing answers was giving me hard times, so I switched to this one.\nhttps://gist.github.com/altbrace/52ae1783b31257021520673fadb95b6e\nThis particular script changes the sound profile of the Bluetooth device to mSBC, but you can alter the subprocess call to do whatever you wish. If so, you can also remove the time.sleep() call.\nAdd this to background execution as described by @Yixing or however else.\n", "Q: What's the equivalent of \"add or remove programs\" in Ubuntu? I wanted to install the plugin TeXlipse (installation instructions) and for that I am supposed to remove any previous version of it. Maybe the eclipse GUI is sufficient to achieve this end.\nWhat's the equivalent of \"add or remove programs\" in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The Ubuntu Software Center is the equivalent of Add/Remove programs. It contains a software catalog that you add software to your system, but it can also be used to remove software.\nStart the Ubuntu Software Center (it's on the Unity bar) and click on Installed at the top. Find the software application either by clicking on the appropriate category or by using the search area at the top of the window. Click on the application and then click remove on the right hand side.\n\nA: The analogue to Add/Remove porgrams in Ubuntu is USC - Ubuntu software center, which You can start from Your \"main Ubuntu\" menu. Which is dash in 12.04 and Gnome panel in previous versions. Also in previous versions there was Synaptic package manager, which was something like install/remove utilities and libraries from windows. \nAlso there is apt (Advanced Package ... something :p) which is very advanced command-line tool for installing applications and other software. (In previous versions also aptitude and dpkg are present)\nSo if You need to uninstall some package or app, that You know by name, try:\nsudo apt-get remove packagename\n\nor try to find it in Ubuntu Software Center, and click uninstall.\nRegards,\n\nA: If you are looking for the Add/Remove applications that was replaced by software-center (gnome-app-install), you can't get it on the newer versions, however the closest to that would be gnome-packagekit.\n", "Q: tk installation doesn't work for ruby1.9.1 Ok, this is what I did before I landed onto a terminal with a bunch of error messages...\n\nFirst, I installed ruby1.9.1 using apt-get. \n(All of those ruby1.9.1 packages including ruby1.9.1-examples and  ruby1.9.1-full).\nThen, I installed tcl8.5 and tk8.5 including their dev packages similarly.\nThen, I installed libtcltk-ruby1.9.1 \nAs expected, ruby --version says that I have got \nruby 1.9.3p0 (2011-10-30 revision 33570) [x86_64-linux]\n\nBut in irb, when I require 'tk' it says:\nRuntimeError: tcltklib: fail to Tk_Init().

In Windows there’re perhaps only a couple of important folders (by important I mean important in my logical picture of the Windows file system) in the installation drive (in my case C:\\). Namely Program Files and Windows. I simply stay away from Windows folder and the “add remove program files” is good enough to handle the program files folder of Windows. Of course there’s a folder named Users where the users (who are not admins) can access only their folders.\nThus there’s a clear picture at some level in my mind of the Windows file system. In Ubuntu, when I reach the location /, there’s a huge list of folders, most of which I have no clue as to what they contain. The /bin folder seems to be the equivalent of the Windows folder in windows. The /usr folder seems like it’s the equivalent of the Users folder in Windows. But even the /home folder looks like it can fit the bill.\nPlease understand that I do understand, that Ubuntu (Linux) has a different character than that of Windows, i.e., there need not be exact equivalent of Windows functions, in Ubuntu. All I am looking for is a bit more clearer picture of the Ubuntu file system.\n This question is a part of a bigger question which I am splitting up to make it more answerable. The original question can be found here:\nhttp://sgsawant.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/whats-the-equivalent-of-add-or-remove-programs-in-ubuntu/ \n\nA: Late Answer - I've created a roadmap for beginners to follow. If they are looking for a file but don't know where to look, they can use the map to roughly navigate around. You can download a hi-res PNG here. You can find the related post here. I will keep updating both the file and the post when time permits, incorporating helpful comments.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu (like all UNIX-like systems) organizes files in a hierarchical tree, where relationships are thought of in teams of children and parent. Directories can contain other directories as well as regular files, which are the \"leaves\" of the tree. Any element of the tree can be references by a path name; an absolute path name starts with the character / (identifying the root directory, which contains all other directories and files), then every child directory that must be traversed to reach the element is listed, each separated by a / sign. \nA relative path name is one that doesn't start with /; in that case, the directory tree is traversed starting from a given point, which changes depending on context, called the current directory. In every directory, there are two special directories called . and .., which refer respectively to the directory itself, and to its parent directory. \nThe fact that all files and directories have a common root means that, even if several different storage devices are present on the system, they are all seen as directories somewhere in the tree, once they are mounted to the desired place\nFind examples and more information here:  \n\nA: This following text shows the directory structure.\nmtk4@laptop:/$ pwd\n/\nmtk4@laptop:/$ tree -L 1\n.\n|-- bin\n|-- boot\n|-- cdrom\n|-- dev\n|-- etc\n|-- home\n|-- lib\n|-- lost+found\n|-- media\n|-- mnt\n|-- opt\n|-- proc\n|-- root\n|-- run\n|-- sbin\n|-- selinux\n|-- srv\n|-- sys\n|-- tmp\n|-- usr\n|-- var\n\nThe main components here are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot : Contains the boot loader\n\n*/home : Contains the home directories of users.\n\n*/bin : All the executable binaries and commands used by all the users on the system are located here.\n\n*/sbin : This contains the system executable binaries typically used by system administrators.\n\n*/lib : Contains the system libraries that support the binaries in /bin and /sbin.\n\n*/etc : Contains the configuration files for network, boot-time, etc.\n\n*/dev : This has the device files i.e. usb, terminal device or any  other device attached to the system are shown here.\n\n*/proc : Contains information about the process running.\n\n*/tmp : This is the temporary directory where many processes create the temporary files required. This is purged each time the machine is booted.\nFor more details, Thegeekstuff link perfectly explain the generic linux file-system.\n\nA: You can read up on this on for instance wikipedia. An excerpt:\n\nThe Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the main directories and their contents in Linux operating systems. For the most part, it is a formalization and extension of the traditional BSD filesystem hierarchy.\nThe FHS is maintained by the Linux Foundation, a non-profit organization consisting of major software and hardware vendors, such as HP, Red Hat, IBM and Dell.\nThe current version is 3.0, released on June 3, 2015.\n\nA visual representation with a short description:\n\nBasically Linux has divided the directory structure based on the function of what is needed to make the system as secure as possible with the minimum amount of permissions needed. Otherwise someone is bound to have to do alot of avoidable work.\nRemember that Unix and Linux were made as multi-user systems and Windows was created for a single user. Everything else can be explained from that idea. You can explain every directory when thinking about it being multi-user and security.\n3 examples:\n\n*\n\n*You will see that files and directories that are admin only are gathered in the same directory: the s in /sbin and /usr/sbin and /usr/local/sbin stands for system. A normal user can not even start programs that are in there. Files a normal user can start are in /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin based on where it most logically should reside. But if they are admin only they should go to the s version of that directory.\nThere is a famous utility called fuser. You can kill processes with it. If a normal user could use this (s)he would be able to kill your session.\n\n\n*The same goes for /home: /home/user1 is property of user1. /home/user2 is property of user2. user2 has no business doing stuff in user1's home (and the other way around is also true: user1 has no business doing stuff in user2's home). If all the files would be in /home with no username underneath it you would have to give permissions to every file and asses if someone is allowed to write/remove those files. A nightmare if you have tens of users.\n\n\n*Addition regarding libraries.\n/lib/, /usr/lib/, and /usr/local/lib/ are the original locations, from before multilib\nsystems existed and the exist to prevent breaking things. /usr/lib32, /usr/lib/64, /usr/local/lib32/, /usr/local/lib64/ are 32-/64-bit multilib inventions.\nIt is not a static concept by any means. Other Linux flavours made tweaks to this lay-out. For instance; currently you will see debian and Ubuntu changing a lot in the lay-out of the FHS since SSD is better off with read only files. There is a movement towards a new lay-out where files are split in to a 'read only' and a 'writable' directory/group so we can have a root partition that can be mounted read only (partition for a ssd) and writable (sata hdd).\nThe new directory that is used for this (not in the image) is /run/.\n\nA: \\Users is equivalent to /home. The name of /usr is a historical artifact.\nThe combined equivalent of \\Windows and \\Program Files is the combination of /bin,  /boot, /etc, /lib, /sbin, /tmp, /usr and /var. Linux and Windows split up installed software differently. Windows distinguishes between the operating system and companion programs. Linux doesn't make this distinction in the same way; most if not all software comes through Ubuntu (the distributor) and is installed in the same directory hierarchy, and since software is tracked by the package manager, there is no need to store each program in its own directory. On Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc is for system configuration files: configuration files that affect all users, whether they apply to the operating system as a whole or to a specific application.\n\n*/usr is for system code and data (programs, libraries, documentation, etc.).\n\n*/var is for variable or temporary data: temporary files, logs, package manager databases, printer spools, game save files, etc. There is also /tmp for temporary files that can be erased across reboots.\n\n*/bin, /lib and /sbin in the root directory have counterparts in /usr. The files that are outside /usr are the ones that are needed early in the boot process. This is a relic from the time when disks were small and /usr might be on a filesystem shared between several workstations over the network, it isn't really a useful distinction on most systems.\n\n*/boot contains a few files that are needed only to boot the operating system, and not for day-to-day operation.\n\n\nThere are additional directories that don't correspond to anything that Windows has:\n\n\n*\n\n*/root is the root user's home directory. The root user is an administrator account not tied to any particular user; it's the user that you change to when you run sudo. Ubuntu doesn't let the root user log in by default.\n\n*/media and /mnt are mount points: they're where you can see the filesystems of other operating systems and remote drives. The Windows equivalent is other drive letters.\n\n*/proc and /sys show system information. On Windows, you need to wade through menus or call system commands or install third-party programs to see this information.\n\n\nUbuntu, like other Linux distributions, generally follows the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.\n\nA: Give this command a try:\nman 7 hier\n\nYou can also view this manual page here: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man7/hier.7.html\n", "Q: Icons can't be seen on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS's  Launcher after updates After updating yesterday, (can unfortunately not remember the specific updates) the launcher could not be made to appear.

I'm using Jupiter to manage my CPU speed.  Is there a place to change it to display the core temp in Fahrenheit?  I can't find the config file.\n\nA: The temperature in Celsius is hard-wired into Jupiter.\nFortunately, Jupiter is written in Python - this makes it very easy to change.\nFirst backup your copy of jupiter:\ncp /usr/bin/jupiter ~/jupiter\n\nNext edit the file:\ngksudo gedit /usr/bin/jupiter\n\nFind the following section in the file:\ndef get_temperature(self):\n        temp = int(self.collect_data(self.temp))\n        temp = temp / 1000\n        return str(temp) + ' ºC'\n\nchange to:\ndef get_temperature(self):\n    temp = int(self.collect_data(self.temp))\n    temp = temp / 1000\n    temp = ((temp * 9) / 5) + 32\n    return str(temp) + ' ºF'\n\nSave, logout and login.\n\nObviously, an update to the jupiter PPA will overwrite your changes.  \nYou can either disable the PPA, or save /usr/bin/jupiter as (for example) /usr/bin/jupiter2.  In your startup applications, change the jupiter startup command to python /usr/bin/jupiter2\n", "Q: Identify Wireless MAC Address I have a desktop for which I am using an Asus N-10 USB Wireless Adapter. No driver software is needed I guess since I can see the available wifi networks. However, I am unable to connect as the \"MAC Address\" I gave to my service provider is incorrect. I provided the wlan HWaddr which I think is the equivalent of the MAC address but it is still not correct. A different Windows machine works fine so I know there are no mistakes. How can I find the correct number which is the equivalent of a MAC address.\n\nA: You are right. Your W-LAN \"HWAddr\" (Hardware Address) is your wireless devices MAC Address. You can look it up by typing\nifconfig wlan0\n\nwhich will show you something like this\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  Hardware Adresse 00:c0:ca:19:d3:1e\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metrik:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          Kollisionen:0 Sendewarteschlangenlänge:1000 \n          RX-Bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX-Bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nIn case your wireless adapter uses another interface name, which you do not know, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ifconfig to get a listing of all interfaces\n\n*Disconnect the USB-Device\n\n*Check which one is missing, by reissuing ifconfig\n\nA: The wlan0 HWaddr reported by the command ifconfig actually is the correct MAC address. It looks like this :\n HWaddr 51:04:b6:07:42:73\n\nSo either the MAC filtering was incorrectly set up, or you have other interfaces or options (you did not post ifconfig output so it is rather hard to guess).\nDo try another wifi access point, just to check the ability to connect to network without other problems.\n", "Q: How to store Pictures folder on another hard drive?

I don't care If I use nvidia, nuveau or other drivers.\n\nA: I have the same laptop, your Nvidia card is called \"Optimus\" and won't run with the normal Nvidia drivers as Nvidia have \"no plans to support it in Linux\"\nHowever:\nThere is a guide on this site:\nInstalling Bumblebee for Nvidia Optimus\nDon't be alarmed by the name, it tells you how to set up the Optimus card and how to increase battery life by appx. 60% in my experience.\nYou will need to remove the Nvidia drivers you have first - Google is your friend for that.\nAfter that you need to splash the cash on a mini DP to VGA adaptor (8-15 British Pounds on Ebay) for your external monitor as there is currently no support for HDMI and Optimus on the Dell L502x at least (others maybe?).\nI work using projectors all the time and find this to be a robust and usually stable solution.\nThis gives me 1366x768 on the laptop and 1080x1920 on my external monitor.\nHope this helps.\nRichard.\n\nA: A couple of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, you should let xrandr do all the work, and get rid of any 'xorg.conf'.\n\n*Secondly, you need to understand which ports are connected to which GPU, which you can also use the xrandr command for.\n\n\nI'm guessing from the fact you weren't able to get it working out of the box that the internal laptop display is only available from the Intel GPU, and the external display port is only available from the Nvidia GPU. If this is the case then your only option is to have both GPUs work together co-operatively (Optimus), to get the job done.\nIf your laptop isn't muxless, then it's possible you can disable the Intel GPU (using the BIOS display settings), and have the Nvidia GPU drive both the internal display and the external display port, depending on whether it has access to both displays.\nIf your laptop is muxless, then you no choice but to use Optimus, and you have the following three options available to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bumblebee (max 2 displays)\n\n*Nvidia Prime (max 4 displays)\n\n*Optimus Prime (max 4 displays)\n\n\nEach option has it's pros and cons, but I've written an article (Driving Multiple Monitors on an Optimus Laptop) that should be a helpful resource for anybody struggling to understand the differences between these options, and to navigate their way through all the jargon.\n", "Q: How to dynamically get name, version and other info from a Python app at runtime I'm writing an Python app that makes use of a Gtk.AboutDialog.

I have been experimenting with juju for an upcoming platform evaluation\nQuestion I know I will be asked:\nIs it possible to run juju on non-ubuntu distros?\n\nA: Juju is not specific to EC2. it can work on OpenStack, bare metal, and other machine resource providers. At the moment it is specific to Ubuntu. Part of that is that, in the notion of cloud/utility computing, the distinction of the underlying OS is not as important versus the services offered/deployed on those systems. Additionally, the charm definitions themselves are OS specific. In future it will likely support additional operating systems, with a separate collection of OS-specific charms.\n\nA: The juju client currently runs on Ubuntu, Debian, OSX, and Windows. For distributions that do not have Juju packaged it can be built from source. \nAs far a deploying it on a non-Ubuntu server, right now work is underway to enable support for CentOS, Debian, and Windows. Support for these operating systems is expected to land in future Juju versions, optimistically 1H of 2015.\n\nA: The client is pretty portable to any unix like system, at the moment its pure python minus a dependencies on libzk and libzk python bindings and twisted's openssl usage (cert checks).\nIf you want to try it via pip/easy_install (older version of juju atm)\npip install zkpython txzookeeper juju \n\n\nA: Note, the client also now runs on Windows as of juju 1.14, see https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/reference-releases\n", "Q: Websites in Firefox using only half of the screen I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, and I've installed Gnome3 on it.\nFirefox used to run normally, but one day I used the \"snap\" feature to snap it to the left and then maximized it again.

Still the same issue. \nI tried the same printer on my desktop running ubuntu 12.04 with unity. The printer works fine. \nIs there a reason why this would happen?\n\nA: I just had the same problem, although mine was an HP Deskjet 1300, and was able to solve it after installing the HP CUPS packages found in Synaptic, and the hplip package. \nAfterwards I opened \"printing\", just as you did, but instead of going to properties of the identified printer, I decided to add another one.

I tried to use Boot Manager at OS X, but it doesn't detects the system partition. What should I do?\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: It's unclear how you were booting before, so it's unclear how you'd restore whatever your previous configuration was. I'll therefore suggest that you install rEFIt or its successor rEFInd. These are boot managers that scan the disk for EFI and BIOS boot loaders and enable you to boot anything that they find. Chances are either one will pick up your \"lost\" Ubuntu boot loader. Be aware that if you use rEFInd, it defaults to scanning only for EFI boot loaders, so if you had been booting Ubuntu in BIOS mode, you may need to reconfigure rEFInd to scan for BIOS boot loaders by editing the \"scanfor\" option in its refind.conf configuration file.\n", "Q: Mutt runng from Crontab I have a bash script that is sending an email through command line mutt. This bash script is being called from a cron job (setup using crontab -e because of permissions needed to do all items in the script).

I'm a novice Linux user. I'm currently using Xubuntu 11.10\nI like getting the best I can out of my hardware. This includes sound. In windows it was quite simple. I just went to the audio settings and set the bit depth and sampling rate to the biggest values available.\nWith Xubuntu though, it's a little more tricky. There is no advanced settings in the graphic configurator. That means I have to look for bit depth and sampling rate in a configuration file. The thing is, I don't know which one exactly.\nIf anyone could tell me which one it is and which lines I have to modify, I would be grateful.\n\nA: Above answer is correct, but it will change Pulse Audio settings only. This is how sound works on Linux:\nApp > Pulse Audio > ALSA > actual soundcard\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps can do their own audio processing, although it's uncommon.\n\n*Pulse certainly does its own audio processings.\n\n*The later can also be said about ALSA.\n\n\nSo, changing Pulse Audio sample format and sample rate is just the FIRST step to be taken. You have to properly set up ALSA.\nNow, I can't tell you how to do that. Not a single recent Ubuntu release allows you to change ALSA settings via configuration files. Apparently, ALSA will always resample everything to 48KHz/16bit and you're stuck to it. I must remind you that ALSA mixing and resampling algorithms are of very, very, low quality, similar to XP's KMixer.\nThat means: until someone makes it possible to change ALSA sample format and sample frequency on recent (2012/2013) Ubuntu distros, as you can change Pulse's, audio on Linux just SUCKS like hell!\nAlso, don't set sample rate to \"maximum option available\", that will do audio resampling and you don't want that! Set sampling rate according to what you hear. If a CD audio: 44.1KHz. If DVD: 48KHz. Bit depth instead should always be the highest available, whereas 24bit seems to be the highest the best cards can handle.\nI recommend my YouTube video for more information. You can extract from it what's more useful for you.\n\nA: In addition to the answer from Scott Stensland, which advises to edit the configuration file for the pulseaudio server, I also had to delete all of the files in ~/.config/pulse.\nSource: Linux Mint Forums\n\nA: To change the sample rate and audio bit depth we need to edit the configuration file for the pulseaudio server /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\n\nPlease backup the original settings to restore the defaults in case som settings break your audio.\n\nLook for the following entries:\n; default-sample-format = s16le\n; default-sample-rate = 44100\n\nBoth are commented out with ;. This means they are not read as the entries given here are the defaults. Uncoment them and replace them with values that suit you better. Always keep in mind that this may be on cost of system performance or stability when choosing extreme values.\nPossible entries for the sample format are:  u8, s16le, s16be, s24le, s24be, s24-32le, s24-32be, s32le, s32be float32le, float32be, ulaw, alaw\nPossible entries for the sample frequency are anything between 1 and 192000 Hz (choose sensible values!)\nSave this file as ~/.pulse/daemon.conf or in it's original location (you need to be root then). In order for changes to take effect pulseaudio needs to be restarted with pulseaudio -k in a terminal, or by log out and log back in.\n", "Q: Downloading error \"Could not retrieve the required disk image \" When I try to download Ubuntu 12.04 using the Windows installer (Wubi) through a proxy server which requires proxy authentication, after I choose the Ubuntu installation size, username and password, when I click the Install button, I get this error:\nAn error occurred:\nCould not retrieve the required disk image files\nFor more information, please see the log file:\nc:\\users\\(myusername)\\appdata\\local\\temp\\wubi-12.04-rev266.log\n\nThe log file says: proxy authentication error\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: First try to extract the installation files from the .iso. Then put the .iso file into the folder where its contents were extracted. For example, put ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso (or whatever your .iso file is called) into a folder named ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386 that was created by extracting the .iso itself. Then try installing again.\nIf you don't have the ability to extract the contents of an .iso file, you can do this in your Windows system with 7-Zip.\n\nA: Download the iso first and then extract it.

If it's not possible then maybe just the Dash show/hide animations. I simply find myself waiting for animations which is pointless.\n\nA: Sorry, You can't. At this point (25th July, 2012) with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, There is NO easy way to disable Unity animations. (at least without recompilation).\nAnd I don't think, there will be an option to disable animations in future releases. Because, One of the goal of Unity is to provide pleasing user experience and animations are considered one of the best way to achieve that.\nA workaround:\nThe possible workaround for you is changing the dash animation to fade (cause, In my opinion, fades are quicker than sliding). You may also interested in disabling the animations for all windows also. To do this,\n\n*\n\n*Download and install compizconfig-settings-manager\n sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager  \n\n\n\n*Open it by searching or typing ccsm in dash. Go to Unity plugin → Experimental tab and change the settings for Hide animations to Fade only.\nIf you want to disable the animations in all window, you can disable the Animations plugin in ccsm. If you want to disable Fading, disable the Fading windows plugins.\nHope this will help.\n\nEdit: As izx showed in his edited answer You clearly see that, the options of dash animations are hard coded in the Unity, and those cannot be changed with any configuration options, because those time durations aren't variable which can be changed. So, this means, You have to recompile unity by changing those time durations to 0 ms to completely disable the animations.\n\nA: \n1. Why you cannot disable this Dash animation in Unity 12.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Unfortunately, the fade/opacity animation and associated times are hard-coded in the Unity source code.\n\n*The actual code may be found in unity-5.12/plugins/unityshell/src/ShortcutController.cpp (this is what you would have to modify and recompile to get rid of the animations)\n\n*Some sample lines from this file demonstrating the hard-coding of the animation when you use the Super key to launch the Dash:\n\n30:const unsigned int SUPER_TAP_DURATION = 650;\n31:const unsigned int FADE_DURATION = 100;\n39:  , fade_in_animator_(FADE_DURATION)\n40:  , fade_out_animator_(FADE_DURATION)\n65:  fade_in_animator_.animation_updated.connect(sigc::mem_fun(this, &Controller::OnFadeInUpdated));\n66:  fade_in_animator_.animation_ended.connect(sigc::mem_fun(this, &Controller::OnFadeInEnded));\n67:  fade_out_animator_.animation_updated.connect(sigc::mem_fun(this, &Controller::OnFadeOutUpdated));\n68:  fade_out_animator_.animation_ended.connect(sigc::mem_fun(this, &Controller::OnFadeOutEnded));\n120:    show_timer_ = g_timeout_add(SUPER_TAP_DURATION, &Controller::OnShowTimer, this);\n149:    self->fade_out_animator_.Stop();\n150:    self->fade_in_animator_.Start(self->view_window_->GetOpacity());\n213:    fade_in_animator_.Stop();\n214:    fade_out_animator_.Start(1.0 - view_window_->GetOpacity());\n244:  .add(\"timeout_duration\", SUPER_TAP_DURATION + FADE_DURATION)\n246:  .add(\"about_to_show\", (Visible() && !fade_out_animator_.IsRunning() && view_window_ && view_window_->GetOpacity() != 1.0f))\n247:  .add(\"about_to_hide\", (Visible() && !fade_in_animator_.IsRunning() && view_window_ && view_window_->GetOpacity() != 1.0f))\n\n\n*Of course, you would have to patch this and rebuild with every new Unity update...\n\n*No amount of meddling with Compiz can change this because all of it is hard-coded outside of the Compiz plugin.\n2. Alternative A: Switch to Ubuntu 2D\nUbuntu 2D has different Unity Shell code, and there, launching the dash via Super is instantaneous and does not animate anything.\n3. Alternative B: Use a custom shortcut to launch the Dash by clicking on the Ubuntu Logo, thus bypassing the animation\nWe can exploit the fact that the opacity/fade animation does not happen when you launch the Dash via the \"start\" button, or, if your cursor is on/around the launcher bar, even if you press Super:\n\nThe animation will be delayed until your cursor actually moves inside the dash area.\n\n\n*\n\n*xdotool allows automation of keyboard and mouse clicks/movements; install it with sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n*Open Settings...Keyboard, and go to the Shortcuts tab. Create a custom shortcut, naming it whatever you want, and set the \"Command\"  to:\nxdotool mousemove --sync 25 60 click 1 --delay 100  mousemove restore\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You may need to adjust the coordinates (25 60) a little if your screen resolution is below 1024x768 or so.\n\n\n*Click Apply. The right-column will say \"Disable\", click on it and you'll see \"New Accelerator\": press your shortcut key combo. You cannot choose Super, even if you disable it in Compiz, because it is hard-captured by Unity. I chose Ctrl+Alt+Z since it's close to the Super key.\n\n*Now your shortcut should launch the Dash much, much faster.\n\n\n*\n\n*Here's a Youtube video demo. The first few times (when the launcher on the left blurs and darkens) is with the SUPER key; then its with the custom xdotool shortcut (notice the launcher no longer animates and the dash appears faster)\n\n\n\nA: Install Compiz Configuration Manager.\nUbuntu Software Center: Compiz Configuration Manager\nor\nTerminal: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nOnce installed open it and got to Ubuntu Unity Plugin -> Experimental(Tab)\nFrom there you can set Lauch Animation, Urgent Animation and Dash Blur to `None.\nSet the Hide Animation to Slide only.\nIf you want, you can change the panel and dash transparency to be full opaque.\n\nA: To add to Ángel Araya's instructions: I was able to disable all animations by deselecting Animations and Fading Windows (basically everything except Window Decoration under the Effects category (tab) in CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\nA: I think turning off fading-windows under effects in CompizConfig Settings Manager can make a difference in Unity. (A subtle difference in speed, but still a difference.)\n\nA: install tweaks\nsudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nlaunch it   gnome-tweaks or just search for tweaks\n\nthen hit   General -> Animations ->  turn it off\n", "Q: Sheet name font size on LibreOffice Calc is too small I am using LibreOffice 3.5.3.2 (Ubuntu 12.04) and the buttons to switch tabs in Calc are written with small fonts. They're so small I can't even read what is written on them.\nI could not find a way to increase font size. Is this problem happenning only with me? Does anyone know a way to increase the font size of sheet names?\n\nA: If your preferred theme shows too small fonts in the UI components of LibreOffice, you could just scale the textual UI elements (between 80% and 130%) while keeping the theme. LibreOffice has an option for scaling in Menu Options -> LibreOffice -> View:\n\nSo, you can modify the font size between\n\n(80 percent)\nand \n\n(130 percent).\nNote: This will affect all textual UI elements, also menu entries and so on - not only the sheet labels.\nAnother alternative would be to keep the theme but modify the font settings system-wide.

I still don't know if it was a faulty sensor or an over stressed CPU after years of gaming (lol).\nKeep in mind that usually AMD CPUs should be at or below 70C or they will start causing errors, even if they can go all the way up to 105C the north bridge will power down the computer at 100C stopping all fans and/or cooling systems immediately and this event could damage your components.\nI fixed my problem changing the CPU.\n", "Q: Is there a shell-independent HUD-like menu search tool for Xfce/GNOME/Cinnamon? The Ubuntu Heads-Up Display (HUD) - you love it or you hate it. Personally I rather like a classic desktop, so I use Xfce or GNOME-fork Cinnamon, and I'd like to keep those menu's where they are.\nBut the HUD is pretty awesome when your menus are complex and you forgot where an option sits. This makes that search trick very interesting.\nI know the HUD is Unity specific. I am looking for a HUD-like tool to complement the menu in shells other than Unity.\nThere is Appmenu Runner for KDE that does this.\nThere is also appmenu-qt for KDE.\nProblem with the above is that it uses KDE libs, and it only works for KDE apps.\nThis is Linux, there aught to be something like this for GNOME/GTK apps, right?\nLooking for any tool that can search the menus. I already use(d) Synapse, Kupfer and GNOME Do, but those are simply app-launchers (with some tricks). Something like that would suffice if only they included searching the menus for the currently focused application.\nThe HUD allows users to activate menu items by typing part of the name. It uses a fuzzy search algorithm that will highlight partial matches. It can match menu items that are multiple layers deep in an application's menu hierarchy. The feature, which replaces traditional menu accelerators, is activated by pressing the alt key.\nSimilar questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to search a menu bar in Debian? - Unix.StackExchange\n\n*How can I access menu bar items alike hud (unity)? - Unix.StackExchange\n\n*HUD in other window managers (especially xmonad) - AskUbuntu\n\n\nA: I prefer Synapse over Gnome-Do.\nIt seems that there is some discussion about bringing this feature to Synapse.\n\nA: There's qmenu_hud:\nhttps://github.com/tetzank/qmenu_hud\nIt just retrieves the menu entries over dbus and displays them in dmenu.\nYou still have to get your applications, or rather the toolkit they are using, to export their menu entries to dbus. This is easily done with appmenu-qt for KDE and Qt applications. I'm not sure but i think you need a patched version of gtk to get appmenu enabled there. I guess Ubuntu ships patched gtk packages by default for Unity.\n\nA: Have a look at Plotinus. It is shell independent, but it works only with applications that use the GTK+ 3 toolkit. (I hope that will satisfy.)\n\nFrom the github README:\n\nHave you used Sublime Text's or Atom's \"Command Palette\"? It's a list of everything those editors can do that opens at the press of a key and finds the action you are looking for just by typing a few letters...\nPlotinus brings that power to every application on your system (that is, to those that use the GTK+ 3 toolkit). It automatically extracts all available commands by introspecting a running application, instantly adapting to UI changes and showing only relevant actions...\nJust press Ctrl+Shift+P (configurable) and you're in business...\n\nAbout shell-dependent solutions\nI realize the OP asked about sell-independent solutions, but for thoroughness, let me say:\n\n*\n\n*howtogeek said (2017-10-29) \"With the switch to the GNOME Shell environment, nothing like the HUD is available, even as an extension.\"\n\n*There actually is a gnome shell extension for the HUD. Update: here is the current version. (The old version's recent reviews are negative, and some of the positive reviews point out that it doesn't work in Ubuntu 17.10.)\n\n*Mate (desktop environment) offers a HUD: \"A favourite of Unity 7 users is the Heads-Up Display (HUD) which provides a way to search for and run menu-bar commands without your fingers ever leaving the keyboard.\"\n\n\nA: The following two applications are nominally part of Xfce, but can readily be used in the DE of your choice.\n\n\n*\n\n*xfce4-appfinder: The Application Finder in Xfce. \n\n\n*xfdashboard: \"Maybe a Gnome shell like dashboard for Xfce\"\nIt comes with extensive documentation and screenshots. \n\n\nThe panel plug-in solution below, however, is not desktop-independent and requires the use of xfce4-panel. But since you are using Xfce and are looking for similar functionality in the Gtk  world, the following could help. \n\n\n*\n\n*xfce4-whiskermenu: \"Whisker Menu is an alternate application launcher for Xfce. [..] If you’re not sure exactly where a program is listed, instead of browsing through each category you can simply enter a search term. The search field is focused when opening the menu, so you can just start typing.\" \n\n\nIn addition, check How can I have a dash-like search under Xfce? for a similar question with relevant answers. \n\nA: I would recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Awesome-wm\n\n*Conky\n\n\nSee Conky HUD to see how you can \"use awesome to turn Conky into a heads-up display (HUD) of sorts\".

I'm using Xubuntu 12.04. In the Power Manager, I have checked Extended -> Lock screen when going for suspend/hibernate. If I choose to suspend from the main menu / Panel 1, the screen is locked. However, if I use dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\" /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend (see How can I suspend/hibernate from command line?; I use this command via a keyboard shortcut), the screen is not locked. How can I (1) suspend the system (2) have the screen locked at the same time (3) do not require root rights to do so [since I would like the command to be assigned to a keyboard shortcut].\n\nA: I was using amfcosta's dbus command to suspend from the command line.  However, upon resume, eth0 was down.\nI then found this command:\nxfce4-session-logout --suspend\nThis command disables networking, suspends, and then re-enables networking when the computer wakes up.\nxfce4-session-logout is xfce specific, but other desktop environments may have similar *-session-logout commands.\nI am running Xubuntu 14.04.\nUpdate: This may not affect others, but it turns out that on my Asus EEE 900, the wired ethernet connection only works every other time the EEE wakes up.  This is, of course, very annoying, and means that suspend is unusable.\n\nA: You can do that by using the following:\ngnome-screensaver-command --lock && dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\" /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n\nIn a keyboard shortcut you need to put sh -c \"<command>\" replacing <command> with the command above, like:\nsh -c \"gnome-screensaver-command --lock && dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\"\n\nIf the above command does not work, you can also try using a shell script file (for example suspend_lockscreen.sh). First create the file call the following commands in a console:\ncd ~\necho \"gnome-screensaver-command --lock\" >> suspend_lockscreen.sh\necho \"dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\" >> suspend_lockscreen.sh\nchmod +x suspend_lockscreen.sh\n\nThat will create a file named suspend_lockscreen.sh in the user home folder. Then, in the shortcut just call: ./suspend_lockscreen.sh.\nNote: gnome-screensaver-command can be replaced by xscreensaver-command, as pointed out in one comment.\n\nA: With Ubuntu 15.10, this works as well:\ngnome-screensaver-command --lock && systemctl -i suspend\n\n\nA: Note: the xscreensaver-command only works with option -lock (with 1 hyphen, not a double as with the gnome-screensaver-command). Yet, the command only works when the screensaver is running, so not very useful.\n", "Q: Is there a program that tells ram usage? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I monitor the memory usage? \n\nI have Ubuntu 12.4 LTS and I need a program that will be able to monitor my ram usage.

The thing about cache is that it automatically expands, as you use the disk, to occupy all remaining physical memory not used for programs (save for a few megabytes).  However, when programs need it it's still \"available\" to them, so it is misleading to think of it as \"in use\".\nI use free -m which also shows a count of used and free physical memory where buffers and cache are not counted as \"used\", which is more realistic.\n", "Q: Cron job not executing?

I have been using Ubuntu's encrypted home folder system for some time now and have not really noticed any slowdowns except in two specific cases.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I run du -s in my home folder, it takes several times longer than when doing it on the same data on an unencrypted partition.\n\n*When entering a folder containing >1000 images in Krusader, it takes 10-20 seconds before Krusader shows the files (it is completely unresponsive during that time).\n\n\nBoth seem to have to do with accessing several thousands of files without really reading any of their data, which seems to mean that the system will have to traverse lots and lots of inodes. I can't see why this would be slower on ecryptfs than when not using encryption though since this should still be IO-bound rather than CPU-bound even if the inodes are all encrypted.\nDoes anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: Here's why, based on an explanation by one of the lead Canonical developers:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Getting a list of all filenames in a directory requires decoding, parsing and decrypting the lower filenames.\n  \n*The stat() calls from du cause a lookup, which requires allocating an eCryptfs inode, reading part of the lower file metadata, checking to make sure it is an eCryptfs file and then parsing out the unencrypted file size to set the eCryptfs inode's i_size field. Keep in mind that reading the metadata from the lower filesystem involves reading a page into the lower filesystem's page cache.\n\nPut simply, the problem is not I/O rate, but IOPs -- huge numbers of IOPs!\neCryptFS is getting better as it evolves: compare the Phoronix benchmarks of 9.10 vs. 11.10.\nYou may want to consider dm-crypt, which has historically been faster and still seems to have an edge.\n", "Q: How do I get keyboard shortcut working for maximise in gnome-shell?

Go to the Octave downloads website and find the latest release of GNU Octave and download the .tar.gz file of it.\nAfter this copy and paste the following terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) commands:\nsudo apt-get build-dep octave\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo mv octave-x.x.x.tar.gz ~\ncd ~\ntar xvf octave-x.x.x.tar.gz\ncd octave-x.x.x\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nWhere the 'x.x.x' refers to the version of GNU Octave you'd like to install, such as 3.6.3.\n\nA: Just as an update: this PPA (maintained by a member of the Debian Octave Group) provides the latest Octave for a range of Ubuntu versions.\n\nA: This PPA should solve your problem, provided you are running the latest 12.04.\nOpen Terminal Ctrl-Alt-T and type:\n\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:picaso/octave\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install octave\nsudo apt-get install liboctave-dev \n\n\nFor Ubuntu 20.04, see this answer.\n\nA: I am only \"answering\" this because I could not format in the comments. kudos to @izx and @Brenton Horne\nFor 14.0.4.2, I had to use a bit of both answers:\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:picaso/octave\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install octave\nsudo apt-get install liboctave-dev\n\nThese made octave 4.0 run, but not with --force-gui\nsudo apt-get build-dep octave\n\nwas also required to get --force-gui to work.\n\nA: This does not use apt-get, but an alternative mechanism, flatpak, which has its own elaborate installation instructions, depending on Linux distribution and desktop environment used.\nYou can run the newest version of Octave (5.1.0 since March 2019) by running it as a Flatpak app. \"Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux.\"\nThe installation procedure for the Octave package is described here: https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.octave.Octave (2 commands at bottom of page)\nIf you are on Ubuntu 16.04, You have to install flatpak first, then run Octave:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexlarsson/flatpak\nsudo apt install flatpak\nsudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak  # optional, AFAIK\nflatpak install flathub org.octave.Octave\nflatpak run org.octave.Octave --gui\n\nThis downloads about 1.5 GB from the internet, because it installs KDE dependencies as well.\nOn my machine, it installs this:\n       ID                                            Branch        Download\n 1.

In a few weeks I plan to upgrade to 12.04. However, I have heard that upgrade can result in a broken system. So, I thought to make a clean install without formatting because I have heard that it reinstalls your system files and deletes your programs but your personal files and program preferences, which are in /home, are not deleted. \nHow about upgrading and, if something goes wrong, make a clean install without formatting? What are the differences between upgrade and clean install without formatting?\n\nA: Upgrading has been causing much trouble to many. The advantage of upgrading is that not only does it preserve your files and folders, but it also upgrades your system as well all the softwares in it to the 12.04 version.\nHowever, doing a clean install without formatting your /home partition (hoping you have a separate partition for it) will not have the softwares of your previous Ubuntu version. Even though it will install cleanly usually without causing much trouble, you will be left with a 'clean' machine.\nThere is a work around for this however. It is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*First you have to know which all packages are installed in your 10.04. For that you can do\n\n\nsudo dpkg --get-selections \"*\" > pack_file\nAfter running that, you will have the names of all the packages in 10.04 in the file called ‘pack_file’.\n\n\n*\n\n*Transfer that file to 12.04 and run the following commands\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < pack_file\nsudo apt-get -u dselect-upgrade\nThis will fetch all the packages as well as their dependencies and install it on your system.\nSo you have upgraded you system without directly issuing an 'upgrade'! Refer to the following post for details:\nhttp://sosaysharis.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/upgrading-to-ubuntu-12-04-the-way-i-did-it/\n\nA: As far as I understand, you don't have different partitions for / and /home. The safest way to go, imho, is to just backup your home folder to an external drive and do a clean install (w/ formatting).\nThere was another answer on a similar question, which you could view here, but I'm not sure that'll actually work, since I never tried it myself.\nThere's also a question of what happens with all your installed software and configuration files (stored in /etc). On an upgrade they're kept, but on a clean install, you start from scratch. So you have to reinstall and reconfigure everything.\nIf you didn't do extensive customization of your installed software, I would recommend going for a clean install. It's a lot easier to reinstall whatever apps you are using instead of trying to fix a broken system.\nPlease note: it's always a good idea to backup your files before doing any system (re)install. If something can go wrong, there's a big chance it actually will.\n\nA: Well,\nFirstly let me explain you what Upgrade means and what Fresh Install means.\nUPGRADE -\nUpgrade means your system will be updated to the newest resources,applications,libraries,Kernel versions and will have the latest Patches to various software BUT your data that was there in your /home folder will remain intact.\nFRESH INSTALL-\nFresh install means your system will be updated to the newest resources,applications,libraries,Kernel versions and will have the latest Patches to various software BUT your data in /home will be completely lost because fresh install is nothing but installing a new OS.\nNow,about your doubt about broken packages in upgrades,\nThis problem generally occurs when you upgrade online using the UPGRADE TOOL.\nOne way to avoid this is to burn an ISO immage on to a CD/USB making it bootable and then UPGRADING instead of INSTALLING FRESH\nWhen you boot the CD/USB you have created and click on INSTALL on the first screen,next you will get a screen asking for -\n\n\n*\n\n*REPLACE 11.10 WITH 12.04\n\n*UPGRADE 11.10 to 12.04\n\n*SOMETHINF ELSE\n\n\nIf you select the 2nd option,you will have the benefit of UPGRADING with very less risk of Broken Packages\nAlways remember to select to INSTALL 3rd PARTY SOFTWARE and UPDATE DURING INSTALLING when you start the install. This further reduces the risk of broken packages later.\nI would recommend UPGRADE USING A LIVE CD over INTERNET UPGRADE or FRESH INSTALL\nNeedless to tell,backup all your data. \nHope the answer helps you.\n", "Q: Can I create a LiveUSB for installing Lubuntu without using a CD?

If not it's likely that you're missing fonts that comprise farsi characters, and appropriate keyboard layouts. In addition, since farsi requires writing right-to-left, you need to activate CTL (complex text layout) in the language options of LibreOffice.

That happens virtualbox-ose, amsn, wireshark etc. How can I fix that?   \n\nA: At the launching of an application, the launcher uses two variables to decide to start \nseveral instances of the same application or not.\nBy example, if I install squirrel sql (a java application to browse a database) and create a launcher WITHOUT StartupWMClass, then the launcher will start several squirrel processes wich is VERY annoying !\nIn the file launcher that is used to start the application you can find : \nStartupNotify and  StartupWMClass\nStartupNotify=true : we want the notification.\nStartupWMClass : used to find a way to detect if the application was already started.\nPlease have a look at \nunity launcher log question\n\nA: Some of these applications detect that they are running and refer you to the open session of the software. The reasons are varied from such things as that's the way the software works to inability to share resources that need to be accessed.

When I installed Ubuntu it asked me how much drive space to allocate for the OS and I said 80 GB. \nNow I find that I am running out of hard drive space. Disk utility shows that I have 3 partitions that have been added, but none of them are 80 GB.\nThe partitions are:\n - 56  GB ext4\n - 60  GB Extended\n -  4.1GB swap\n\nThe 60GB partition is a container for logical partitions. What is that? \nI am new to any kind of issues concerning hard drives and containers for logical partitions. So my questions are\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do i not have 80 gig available?\n\n*can i merge the 56GB partition with the 60GB partition so i can have more usable space for storing programs in Linux?\n\n\n\nRequested output from: cat /proc/partitions\nmajor minor  #blocks  name\n\n   8        0  488386584 sda\n   8        1      40131 sda1\n   8        2   15360000 sda2\n   8        3  414029711 sda3\n   8        4          1 sda4\n   8        5    3984384 sda5\n   8        6   54970368 sda6 \n  11        0    1048575 sr0 \n   8       16  488358912 sdb \n   8       17  488357888 sdb1\n\n\nA: There are two kind ofpartition in our legacy partition table. \n - Primary\n - Extended\n\nA primary partition is generally used for installation of operating\n  system. A partition table contain at least one and at most 4 primary\n  partition.\nAn extended partition is a special type of primary partition that can\n  hold many logical partition.Extended drive is very popular as in time of re installation you need not worry about drives in extended partition and therefore  data is safe. (except you choose to reformat entire hard disk.)\n\nHowever ubuntu can be installed in extended partition too.\n\nSWAP space is used by a Linux operating system for faster access.It's\n  used for swapping chunk of data with RAM when RAM is full with\n  temporary data and CPU need some other data that is not present in\n  RAM.\n\nSWAP is automatically created (if not edited manually) at rate of 1.5xRAM_SIZE. \nSo your Linux partition is of = (4.6 + 56)GB ~ 60GB\nIf you have disk layout like this\n |→ SWAP  \n |→ EXT4 \n |→ EXTENDED\n\nIt is possible to merge, but not wise. As any formatting in ext4 will cause all data loss. Also you need to convert extended to primary before merging but I am unsure whether deletion of extended partition is possible or not.Probably need some third party tool.\nWhat I recommend: \nCreate one logical disk in the extended partition. Format it with ntfs (if later want to access via windows) or ext4. Use it for storing data.\nIf you have disk layout like this \n  → EXTENDED\n      |→ SWAP\n      |→ EXT4 \n\nThen merging is not possible and everything is fine. BTW What is your total hard disk space?? :P\n\nA: The thing is that the old computers cannot cope with more than 4 (or 3?) partitions. That has to do with the BIOS. Therefore a container is made up so that the BIOS only sees one partition. Linux (and Windows) are intelligent enough to realize that there are actually more partitions. So it is just a legacy issue, nothing to worry about.\nThen the conversion between GB and GiB is around 7%. So when the manufacturer says 80 GB, you actually get 74.5 GiB, which the computer will display.\nYou can type df -h into the terminal, that will show you all file systems. Maybe you did enter 60 GiB instead of 80 GiB during the installation?\nYou cannot merge the 56 GiB with the 60 GiB, since the 60 contains the 56. It is just the wrapper that I mentioned in the first paragraph, it does not consume any space.\nWith gparted, you can move and resize your partitions.

You just have to unlock the password of your key once, after that it's retained in memory by the agent and used automatically\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate a private/public key pair with ssh-keygen -t dsa\n\n*Copy the public key to the remote machine, usually this is ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (use ssh-copy-id for this)\n\n*Run ssh-add before login in to the remote system, this will ask for your passphrase and store it\n\n*Login to the remote system, no password necessary\n\n\nssh-agent is described well on the .net, for example here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://grantingram.wordpress.com/2007/11/25/ubuntu-and-ssh-agent/\n\n*http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html#agent\nAnother advantage of ssh-agent is that if you login to the remote system with ssh -A user@domain.name you can further ssh from the domain.name computer to a third computer containing your public key without every copying you private key to the domain.name computer (and it never sees your private key, only the one-time challenge/response).\n\nA: If you are using Unity, or a session manager that starts gnome-keyring-daemon, you can simply use Seahorse (Passwords and Keys) to establish a key, define what it is for, set a passphrase, and distribute its public key to the computer you are going to use with ssh. No terminal commands are necessary.\nYou create the password by:\n\n\n*\n\n*selecting File->New and select Secure Shell Key. Press Continue.\n\n*Type in a descriptive name, and select Create and set up.\n\n*You will be prompted to enter a keyphrase twice (the second time to check that you didn't mis-enter it the first time.\n\n*Enter the computer to which the public key should be used and the user name on that computer for which you will be using the key. The public key will be copied to that other computer, prompting for your password on that computer if necessary.\nNow the My Personal Keys tab will display the key.\nAssuming gnome-keyring-daemon was started properly when you logged into Lightdm, and again by your session manager, when you first use the key with ssh you will be prompted for the keyphrase. In this dialog box you can provide the keyphrase, select the Details control and ask that the keyring be unlocked whenever you are logged in--automatically providing this key. Press OK\nYou may not be prompted in this way if there is another key available for logging into the remote computer.\nAfter this has been accomplished the first Seahorse tab Passwords will list an \"Unlock password entry\" for the key name. Click on the triangle before \"Passwords: Login\" to see it.\n\nA: Making a password-protected SSH key persist across sessions and reboots\nThis is probably what you want: entering the key passphrase once makes it available for ever whenever you're logged in. It will work for most users who are using the Unity or Gnome desktops.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you connect after adding the public key to the remote server, you'll get the GUI ssh-add dialog:\n\n\n*Expand the \"Details\" by clicking on the triangle, and you'll get the below. The default is \"lock keyring when I log out\", which requires you to enter the password once per session:\n\n\n*Change it to Automatically unlock...whenever I'm logged in, which means it will work whenever you have logged in to your session -- it's \"controlled\" by your user password. It will persist across reboots.\n\n\n*Enter the key passphrase once and that's it - the key is authenticated via the initial successful login to your desktop environment.\n\nIf you are using AwesomeWM\nTested with a fresh install of AwesomeWM in a fresh userid\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, AwesomeWM uses ssh-agent:\n\n$ export | grep SSH\ndeclare -x SSH_AGENT_PID=\"5479\"\ndeclare -x SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\"/tmp/ssh-fWCKNnPq5440/agent.5440\"\n\n\n*To get the above steps to work, you must use gnome-keyring-daemon as the SSH authentication daemon, not ssh-agent. When you login using lightdm, PAM starts gnome-keyring-daemon that will try to unlock a login key with your unlock password, but you must add to you configuration to keep it running and use it.\n\n*Add the following to the end of your ~/.xprofile:\n\n  #!/bin/bash\n  eval $(gnome-keyring-daemon --start)\n  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK\n  export GNOME_KEYRING_PID\n  export GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL\n\nThe commands in the ~/.xprofile file will be executed by xsession before starting the awesome window manager and will tie it to the gnome-keyring-daemon --login process started by PAM through the above environment variables.\n\n\n*\n\n*Logout back to lightdm and log back in, and now when you do ssh user@host, you should get the above popups -- use those to decode your private keys in ~/.ssh/ and save your private keys to the gnome-keyring login keyring.\n\n\nThe general solution for any window manager/desktop environment\n\n\n*\n\n*is to use gnome-keyring-daemon instead of ssh-agent. For this, you need to be running gnome-keyring-daemon and have it initialized and either do this after ssh-agent is started or not start ssh-agent at all.\n\n*ssh (actually ssh-add) decides which authentication agent to call based on the value of the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable, which can be checked by typing export | grep SOCK\n\n*this is of the form SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-MMFyVlI22130/agent.22130 for ssh-agent (NOT what you want to be able to save your key)\n\n*but of the form SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\"/tmp/keyring-mEQB5g/ssh\" for gnome-keyring-daemon (which you want)\n\n*so check the value, and check with ps aux | grep keyring that gnome-keyring-daemon is running, and if so, initialize it with the results of gnome-keyring-daemon --start\n\n*you can then check the associated saved identities in the console by typing ssh-add -l -- if it shows \"no agent\" then you made a mistake configuring gnome-keyring-daemon.\n\nA: If you want to work with private keys do:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -N ''\n\nThen:\ncopy .ssh/id_rsa.pub to machine destination in .ssh/authorized_keys via scp\nscp .ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote_machine:~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nAll done.\nConnect to remote machine without password:\nssh user@remote_machine\n\nAnd we don't have password prompt.\n\nA: you can use \nssh-add 'filename or fullpath'\nyou will be asked for the passphrase if yout key have one \nthen you can connect with out password \n", "Q: How to boot Ubuntu in a dynamic disk where windows 7 is installed My Windows got crashed when i installed Ubuntu 11.04 inside Windows previously. \nhttp://www.dynamic-disk.com/disadvantage-of-dynamic-disk.html\n\nA: I would suggest that you use a fixed disk size for this installation. I can't imagine that wubi would be compatible with this. Given that you have to force Windows 7 to use a dynamic disk, and that you can extend and contract a basic partition in Windows, there is little benefit to the dynamic disk configuration.\n", "Q: Is it safe to browse the Internet with a LiveCD? I am using a Kubuntu 12.04 Live USB, and I'm wondering if web browsing is safe. There have been a lot of updates (150+ or something) since it came out. Specifically with the USB, although I chose the \"Discard on shutdown, unless you save them elsewhere\" option creating the LiveUSB, is there a chance that something malicious can sneak through? Mount my partitions and place something there, for example?\n\nA: \"Safe\" is always relative. You are safe from stuff messing with your operating system. But you are not safe from everything else:\n\n\n*\n\n*malicious SSL certificates\n\n*\"man in the middle\" attacks\n\n*hardware keylogger\n\n*social hacking\n\n*hacks that happened during your session for the rest of the uptime of your live system\n...\n\n\nIn theory, one could mount your partitions and store data on them. But this data would have to be read again after the next reboot, which would require a different hack.\nThere are some hacks that write themselves into the master boot record (MBR) of your hard drives, meaning that the attack starts before the operating system starts. With a CD, that should be impossible. With the USB stick, I am not too sure.\nSo you are safer than before, but you are not \"safe\" in an absolute sense.\n\nA: There aren't many risks to browsing from a Live session, at least none that you wouldn't encounter on a normal installation. \nIf you really care about the security bugs that have been patched since you made your Live USB, you can always run sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade to update your Live Ubuntu for the current session. Note that the updates you install will effectively be lost on reboot, however.\n", "Q: Lost the files pasted in Ubuntu Directly to the point. I cut and pasted several .jpg files from a memory card to a partition in Ubuntu, the partition itself is formatted in NTFS actually. Now the odd things is I created a folder containing those images and I can still open the folder and view the images, before I reboot to update. Then I reboot to my Windows 7 (I am dual-booting) and when I open the partition the folder is not there, I don't know if that's normal but then I rebooted to enter Ubuntu and when I mount the partition, the folder turned to a zip file.\nI checked the disk usage and calculating from files and folder that is visible and total disk space consumed, I assume that the data is there but how can I recover it? I tried viewing hidden files but to no avail.\n\nA: Hidden files is just for files which start with a period. That does not help.\nThere are tools to recover images, I think it was PhotoRec that I used successfully in the past.\nThe less you use that partition, the greater your chances that your files are still there.\nCould it be that you enabled volume compression in the NTFS options?\n", "Q: HDMI onboard sound works but no analog sound I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 recently on my computer, but there's no sound.\nMy computer mobo is Intel and it has VGA, DVI and HDMI outputs, all of them onboard.

But that feature was considered a security risk.\nTo avoid that, maybe the most elegant solution is to get a pop-up window with a question like \"What do you want to with that file: Run or edit?\" (similar to what you have in other file managers like PCManFM and Nemo) when clicking that file - by using Zenity: here. \n\nAn alternative would be custom actions, perhaps the best feature Thunar has.\nThe command that I use for running an executable text file is sh -c %f, for a custom action called \"Run/Execute script\".\n\nThe appearance conditions are simply \"text\":\n\nA similar command can be used for running in terminal a such script (\"Run in terminal\"), while keeping the Xfce4 terminal open:\nxfce4-terminal -H -x %f\n\n\nOptionally, and maybe preferably, in order to hide such options for all text files except the executable ones, a way is to restrict appearance use to .sh files (or .py files if the case, etc), under \"Appearance conditions\": \n\n-- before renaming the executable files accordingly.\n\nA: Specially for Android Studio You can follow my original answer here:\nTo Create Desktop Launcher:\n\n*\n\n*Click on Create Desktop Entry.. from Tools menu.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It will be prompt for password, enter password of your current login.\n\n\n*Finally it will be display notification in Android Studio screen like:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can see in Applications => Programming => Android Studio, and you may see on desktop also after restarting system.\n\nThank you. :)\n\nA: OS: Linux Mint (I'm using 18.3)\nI struggled for ages with this, trying to find out how you can click (or double-click) an executable item and get it to run, without further questions.

Ubuntu's clock is off by about a half hour:\n\nWhere do I even start troubleshooting this?\nIt's allegedly being set \"automatically from the Internet\".

Using ntp avoids this problem, because it will adjust time by skewing the clock. Also, while selecting an ntp server in the neighborhood gives even higher accuracy, it's not necessary. The default ntp config file has several servers in it and the server automatically compensates for any delays. \nBottom line:\n - use ntp \n - if you are far of, shutdown ntp, run ntpdate once and restart ntp.\n\nA: ntp does well at keeping your computer set to the right time, and does that without ever running it backwards--which would be a bad thing for some programs you might be running. \nIt not only sets the time, but it makes continuous adjustments to how your computer keeps time so that its time is not only right at one instant in time, but stays close to the real time (within dozens of milliseconds, not dozens of minutes). It adjusts both phase (the time) and rate (how fast the clock \"ticks\"). ntp never makes the clock run backwards. It can take a long time to establish how fast to tick the clock after a reboot, so ntp keeps track of the drift in a file called /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift . Since you aren't running ntp none of this happens.\nntp is not as popular as it once was because sleeping laptops and desktops, and virtual machines stop it from running some of the time. It's designed to run every once in a while on its own schedule on a computer that is running all of the time, and in the real world where time is continuous. That's probably why it isn't installed by default on the modern workstation. [For Vmware, see this]\n\nInstead ntpdate is run when the network interface is brought up. When a sleeping laptop is awakened it reestablishes the network connection, ntpdate is run, and the time is again correct. If the machine's hardware clock is pretty accurate, and the network is brought up and down fairly often, that's generally good enough for most people.\nFor some reason stock ntpdate doesn't alway run. Use ntpdate-debian instead in this case. Syntax for the for.mer is something like ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com,  for the latter it is ntpdate-debian\nIn the absence of one of those things, then ntp is a better way to keep time.\nSystems are designed to take a timer interrupt every so often and update its idea of the time every interrupt. As long as the hardware timer is running to spec. the time doesn't drift too much. If the hardware timer isn't, the time will drift more (all such clocks will drift some, for the same reason your wristwatch or battery controlled clock will. Clocks plugged into the wall are synced to the time by the frequency and phase kept by your power company).\nMost computer timers are controlled by a crystal controlled oscillator circuit on its integrated circuits. Despite the crystal, they run faster and slower depending on the environment, mostly the temperature. Unless you have some time syncing software installed we don't know about, I'd say your system's clock is off spec.\nIf you were to run ntp for a day or two it would store information in /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift that would indicate how much it would have to adjust the rate at which your operating system time advances per interrupt in order to match your hardware clock rate with the real time it gets over the internet. Keeping the file the same and just starting and stopping ntp after a minute after that (assuming you keep the /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift file unchanged) might do a lot to correct for this if the clock bias ntp sets remains after ntp ends. I'm not sure of this detail.\nI suspect the value ntp would store in /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift is far different than mine.\nIf this machine is kept running all of the time, however, the best thing to do is to install ntp and let it do its thing. See the other answers for details on getting the time right before starting it. I run ntp on my desktop and ntpdate on my laptop.\nAn interesting possible alternative, adjtimex, is mentioned in this answer by nealmcb.\nIf your system is not kept running all of the time, running ntpdate at boot time seems like a good option. \nWarning some software can freak if the computers time goes backwards. Running ntpdate after boot could cause this to occur.\nOne gotcha, that can be a problem: As I recall ntp expects the time to not be too far off. If it is, trying to act conservatively, ntp won't adjust the time at all. If you are in this situation it makes sense to do both--run ntpdate at boot to get the time initialized to the right time, and then let the ntp run to keep it running to provide accurate timekeeping. In particular a bad motherboard battery can cause this error, as can booting a computer that's been off for a long time.\n\nA: - Usually time is only synced once upon each boot or wakeup-from-sleep\n\nSo the problem appears to be either that Ubuntu's default time server (what is it?) has the incorrect time, or Ubuntu is not setting the time automatically from the Internet.\n\nNo, Ubuntu's time server is correct, and it is setting the time automatically from it.\nThe problem is that is usually occurs only once upon each bootup (or to be more precise, each time a network interface is brought up - whether from shutdown, sleep or hibernation). Based on your uptime, it's safe to say it wasn't sync'd in more than a week. And your system clock is running slightly fast for some reason.\n- Set up an hourly cron job to sync if you don't reboot often, or your server/desktop never goes to sleep\nYour best bet is to set up a cron-job, I'd say hourly if you want super-precise time. The easiest way to do that is:\n\n*\n\n*sudo editor /etc/cron.hourly/ntpsync\nAdd the following lines:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com #or your choice of server\n\n\n*\n\n*save, exit and sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.hourly/ntpsync\nYou can put this in /etc/cron.daily instead if you would like, for once per day.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and it was caused by something in the firewall. In the end I added the hourly cron job but added the -u argument to ntpdate to get it to use a none standard port. \nMy problem was caused by Ubuntu not actually checking if ntpdate worked but automatically assuming that it would work.\n", "Q: How do I disable the blank console \"screensaver\" on Ubuntu Server? How to disable blank screensaver on Ubuntu Server?\nThere's no desktop or X, only console (command-line interface).\n\nA: The easiest way is to add the parameter consoleblank=0 to your kernel command-line at boot-time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/default/grub in your favorite editor; you will need to use sudo (for vi, nano, etc.) or gksudo (for gedit, etc.).\n\n*Then add consoleblank=0 to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=, parameter.\n\n*e.g. yours may say:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash consoleblank=0\"\nThen run sudo update-grub, and reboot.\n\nA: Type setterm -blank 0 on any shell to disable blanking out of tty consoles.\n0 disables blanking, any value greater than 0 is the time in minutes.

I am converting from centOS and am used to having a nobody:nobody user:group for running services. Does Ubuntu have a similar best practice user:group combination for running a service?\n\nA: Ubuntu has a nobody user and a nogroup group, I guess these can be used equivalently if you want.\nHaving all (or most) services running under the same user defeats part of the purpose of using a non-privileged user; thus I think the recommended best practice is for each service to have its own user (e.g. apache runs as www-data, I think exim4 will have an exim4 user, spamassassin will have a spamd user (I think!), and so on). When you install a service it takes care of creating this user for you. Sometimes managing permissions to ensure services can talk to each other can be slightly cumbersome, but these instances are usually well-documented and the added security and compartmentalization are worth the (minor) hassle.\n\nA: You can use nobody:nogroup if you really do want a user/group with no permissions.

As described here, one can now disable lightdm like this:\n16.04 upward\nsystemctl disable lightdm.service\n\n15.04, 15.10\nsystemctl disable lightdm\n\n\nA: lightdm is started by Upstart, not SysV Init.\nSo update-rc.d doesn't work.\nUse\n echo  \"manual\" | sudo tee -a /etc/init/lightdm.override\n\n\nA: I just remove the execution bit on the lightdm binary.\nchmod -x /usr/sbin/lightdm\nThen to re-enable it:\nchmod +x /usr/sbin/lightdm\n\nA: This is handled by display-manager...

I was wondering if it could be enabled for mouse wheels too? If yes, how? If not, why not?\nThanks.\n\nA: While true smooth per-pixel scrolling would not work that well with a mouse scroll wheel, having a smooth animation rather than a sudden jump of three lines would be nice.\nI don't know of any way to do that globally but in Firefox it is an option under Preferences->Advanced.\nFor Chromium/Chrome it is currently enabled via a flag by going to chrome://flags.\n\nA: I wish smooth scrolling could be enabled EVERYWHERE, sadly smooth scrolling can not be enabled for mouse wheels because they have \"jumps\" whereas the scroll input from a touchpad is precise enough to register pixel-for-pixel motion.\nTo test this out, fire up a terminal and run\nxev\n\nThen place the cursor in the window and scroll up and down. You will notice that the key (button 4 and 5) registers output continually as long as you move your fingers. Now scroll with the click-wheel. It will only register once per mouse-wheel click.\nSome mouse-wheels do not have distinct \"jumps\" when rolling but I'll bet that the hardware reads the distance travelled by the roller, and sends jumps just like other mice to insure hardware compatibility.\n\nA: Whether or not it's a hardware issue depends on the hardware itself...\nLogitech provides Windows drivers with smooth scrolling for mice with a \"free scrolling wheel\" (no jumps, just a wheel scrolling event for every pixel).\nIt'd be really awesome if I could use my M500 to it's full potential, but xev shows the typical jumps after a certain distance, so it's probably a driver issue.\nNot sure whom to bother and where to fix that.\n\nA: Well I have found a hack to scroll smoothly, I have tested it in multiple apps such as document viewer, gedit, nautilus file manager, etc.\nThis is not a prank or a scam. This is legit.\nMove your mouse cursor to the right edge so that it is above the scroll bar, which is on the right edge of any window (hover anywhere on the right edge where the scroll bar is present), and then just scroll.\nFor some reason this just works and scrolls smoothly. But I think if this can be made to work, it is also possible to enable it in the other apps without much change.\nSometimes this doesn't work so good when the scroll list is too big in nautilus file manager.\nI request you to please share this and make people more aware about this smooth scrolling, so that finally smooth scrolling comes to Ubuntu. Everyone is tired of not being able to scroll smoothly.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Using Wubi I've had Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 on my PC, and just upgraded to 12.04 LTS. I didn't realize that there was capabilities to install it along side with Windows. So now I'm downloading 12.04 with Windows Installer. Should I UNINSTALL the Ubuntu version that's currently partioned? (Windows installer = wubi)\n\nA: no, it's easier to just install the new version on the same partition when you install. If you press advanced settings in partition you can change what part of the partition you want to use. \nGood luck. \n\nA: I suppose the \"Windows Installer\" you refer to is Wubi - if it's not I'm sorry.\nAs wubi is installed somewhat like a normal programme in Windows it should be save not to uninstall your previous Ubuntu versions.\nHowever, since Wubi fiddles with the bootloader you might experience some issues you might not like. Unfortunately I don't know what your bootloader/grub etc. look like.\nBut since you seem to have gotten along with Windows and Ubuntu side by side in a dual boot setup, you should be fine.\nIf you do not want your old install(s) of Ubuntu anymore, I suggest you get rid of them after you've made sure 12.04 LTS on Wubi is what you want.

I haven't yet figured out the best way to present the information, I just want to make it easier for the user to type the name of an application.\nBut before that, I'd like to figure out how to get the data. Is there an API to get a list of all applications from the Software Centre, or indirectly through the Applications Dash in Unity?\n\nA: You can use the xapian DB directly:\nimport xapian\ndb=xapian.Database(\"/var/cache/software-center/xapian\")\nfor m in db.postlist(\"\"): \n    appname = db.get_document(m.docid).get_data()\n\nOr the internal software-center API:\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, \"/usr/share/software-center/\")\nimport softwarecenter.db.database\ndb = softwarecenter.db.database.StoreDatabase()\ndb._aptcache.open()\n# 'use_axi' is use apt-xapian-index\n# 'use_agent' is use the Software Center Agent database\ndb.open(use_axi=False, use_agent=False)\nfor doc in db:\n    app = db.get_application(doc)\n    print app.appname, app.pkgname\n    appdetails = app.get_details(db)\n    # Icon names are relative to /usr/share/app-install/icons/\n    print appdetails.icon\n\n\nA: Use the package python-apt , there are docs in /usr/share/doc/python-apt\nFor example to get a list of all installed packages use\nimport apt\ncache = apt.Cache()\ninstalled_packages = [p for p in cache if p.is_installed]\n\nAs the Software Centre is written in Python you may want to have a look at its source code as well.\n", "Q: lubuntu firefox toggle fullscreen - the menu bar will not come back I'm using Lubuntu with firefox in place of chromium and I experience the following problem: when I press F11 the application goes to fullscreen mode but when I subsequently press F11 the application will only partially exit fullscreen, since the menu bar is totally hidden and the tabs/toolbar appear only when I move the mouse close to the titlebar.\nOther applications fullscreen (e.g. geany) do not have this problem, is this a bug? is there a workaround?\n\nA: I just tested with Ubuntu and I have the same issue.  I tested with windows, and no problem, so I would think it a bug.  there is 2 ways that you can use as a workaround:\n1) Type about:config in the address bar and look for:\nbrowser.fullscreen.autohide;false\nwhat that will do is keep the firefox button and tabs visible\n2) Take a look at this\nHope that this helps\n", "Q: How do I fix a \"Wireless is disabled by hardware switch\" error? I just updated to Ubuntu 12.04 from 11.10 but soon after updating I was disappointed to see that \n\nWireless is disabled by hardware switch.\n\nI can not click the button 'Enable wireless' which is greyed out. Without wireless my computer is useless as I have to connect by wire which is not practical. I have a Acer TravelMate 4500\n\nA: Same happened to me, simply resolved with:\nrfkill unblock all\n\nrfkill list all showed some devices on soft block.\n\nA: Try this\n$ sudo rfkill unblock all\nAlso hit the key on your keyboard that switches your wifi on and off.\nAnother method that usually 100% effective is to simply connect your cable wire to your laptop for a few minutes then unplug it. Reboot and your wifi should be working.\nAlso as mentioned above network manager is buggy. \nI like to use WICD because it is a simple and easy to use network manager. Its a very good alternative to network manager in Ubuntu and it seems to always work when Network Manager doesn't. To install it just open up the terminal.\nTo download and install WICD\nsudo apt-get install wicd-gtk \n\nAnd now you need to uninstall NetworkManager:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge network-manager-gnome network-manager \n\nNow you can find WICD in your menu Start WICD, find the network you want to use and enter the information needed, password, encryption, etcetera and choose Automatically Connect to this network. You should be good to go!\nWICD may also be available in Ubuntu Update Manager so you can look there first but it is important to uninstall Network Manager completely to prevent conflicts!!\n\nA: There are two types of radio kill switches: 'hard' (or physical) and 'soft' (software).\nThe rfkill list command will tell you whether either (or both) of these are set for any connected radio devices.\nIf your wireless card shows \"Hard blocked: yes\", then a physical switch on your laptop case is turned off. Turn it on.\nIf your card shows \"Soft blocked: yes\", then you can turn it back on by running rfkill unblock <ID> where  is replaced by the number from the rfkill list command.\nThere is a bug in network-manager, where if you disabled wifi by right-clicking on the applet and un-checking \"Enable Wireless\", then the menu option becomes grayed out and can no longer be re-enabled. This persists after rebooting. It looks like NM is soft-blocking the wireless card when you disable it (which is a reasonable thing to do), but then graying out the menu item because it is soft-blocked (which is not a reasonable thing to do).\n\nA: I don't know the Acer Travelmate 4500 but I had a similar problem with a Dell laptop.\nFirstly I assume there is no hardware switch ie a physical wireless switch on the side or underneath the laptop?\nIf not then, interrupt the boot sequence by pressing the F2 key \"Set up\" (it may be a different key on your machine) and then look for the wireless settings and ensure they are set correctly. \n\nA: Some machines using a Linux OS don't support toggling by hard switch. In my case, I also had Windows 7 installed on my system. All I did was boot into Windows and turned on Wi-Fi by hard switch.\nThe next time when I ran my Ubuntu OS, it started to get Wi-Fi signals for all routers.\nNote: I tested this solution on a Lenovo B570e.\n\nA: if you just want to reactivate your wifi...\nsudo rfkill unblock wifi\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu One behind proxy I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04.\nI am behind a proxy server which requires authentication.\nWhile setting up Ubuntu One, it is able to sign into my account( step 2 ), but when it comes to step 3( Select Sync Folders ), it just keeps on saying gathering information and nothing happens.\nHow to make Ubuntu One work in this case?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You need to install the ubuntuone-client-proxy package, to be able to use Ubuntu One file sync from behind a proxy.\n", "Q: How do I get Skydrive working?

There is some good news and bad news. The Bad news is that it has many graphic related issues. you can see several of them (Most for the 3D graphics part) here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenChrome\nThe good news are the following:\nOn the same link provided above: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenChrome you can see that there is a compiling from source workaround that \"probably\" could work for the 3D part.\nThere is also some workaround fixed to disable 3D altogether. By editing the xorg.conf: and adding the following:\nSection \"Module\"\n        Disable    \"dri\"\nEndSection\n\n(there are a couple of more xorg.conf edits in the link provided)\nThere is also a ticket system for bugs detected: http://www.openchrome.org/trac/report/1\n(Some of the tickets have ideas and comments about how to fix some of the problems)\nLastly, if not downloaded already (It should be downloaded since it is done by default), download the xserver-xorg-video-openchrome package. And tell xorg.conf to use the following driver in the Device Section: \nDriver \"openchrome\"\nOne final note, some links point to downloading the proprietary VIA driver for this from here: http://linux.via.com.tw/support/downloadFiles.action for what I could see it is very abandonware since the only one I found there was the 9.04 version driver.\nAnyway you have several options that might help, others that might help and a little bit more complicated and the last ones which are just to eliminate 3D completely.\nIf the file xorg.conf is not found, you can created by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the system in Recovery Mode. You can do this by pressing ESC or leaving the SHIFT key pressed until the GRUB menu appears. Select Recovery Mode (Should be second option).\n\n*After booting go to the terminal as root. There is an option that tells you if you want to log in the terminal.\n\n*Type X -configure. The X is in upper case. This will create the file xorg.conf.new in your current home directory.\n\n*Test to see if the file is working by doing this X -config xorg.conf.new. If a gui environment appears and looks good then you can do the following step. If not, I suggest editing the xorg file and changing anything you need until it looks good. You can edit with nano: nano xorg.conf.net doing any modifications and save by pressing CTRL+X and pressing Y to save and quit.\n\n*Copy the new xorg file: cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n*type exit or reboot to test it out.\n", "Q: How to change a LibreOffice Impress presentation from 4:3 to 16:9 ratio?

You can either redirect to a file or remove the redirection altogether, in which case it will email your local user with a report. You can also set a MAILTO variable to have it send e-mail out to someone else (assuming you have a MTA correctly set up on the system).\nSo either:\n* * * * * /home/napolux/yc-screens > /tmp/yc.log\n\nor:\nMAILTO=you@somewhere.com\n* * * * * /home/napolux/yc-screens\n\nMy hunch is that you need to provide a full path to cutycapt (/usr/bin/cutycapt) but it may be something else. The best way to know for sure is to look at logs.\nAlso, I suggest you don't set the script and directory as 777, as that allows anyone to mess with them. Instead, set them as 755 and ensure that your user has permissions to write to the directory.\n\nA: Found the problem... cutycapt needs some sort of X server to work properly, so I used xvfb as explained here...\nhttp://jamesmcdonald.id.au/it-tips/taking-screenshots-of-a-website-in-linux\n", "Q: Why does virt-install man page restrict valid mac addresses? I'd like to use virt-install to create a VM with a specific MAC address. The virt-install man page has this restriction about specifying a MAC address:\n\nFor Xen virtual machines it is required that the first 3 pairs in the\n  MAC address be the sequence '00:16:3e', while for QEMU or KVM virtual\n  machines it must be '52:54:00'.\n\nWhat's the purpose of this restriction? \nNote that when I create instances with OpenStack (which is using kvm via libvirt), the instances are assigned MAC addresses start with fa:16:3e, and everything seems to work fine.\n\nA: \nWhat's the purpose of this restriction?\n\nStandard (good) software engineering practices. The first three octets (bytes) of a MAC address are the OUI (organizational unique identifier), which, as the name suggests, uniquely identify the \"manufacturer\" of the NIC. These are registered with the IEEE and any number of lookup tools can be used to map an OUI to a name.\nAs you might expect, the specific OUIs you mentioned are registered for Xen and KVM, and will show as such if a user runs e.g. lspci or lshw inside the guest.\nYou can change them, but the result will be a misidentification at best. Worst case, these values could somehow be defaults in some part of the virtualized NIC backend (Xen bridge, etc.), with the result that routing to a guest with a non-standard MAC would fail unless you appropriately configured the backend too.\n", "Q: Cyrillic characters show as gibberish in rhythmbox I have some Bulgarian/Russian songs which have Cyrillic characters in them.

My attention was brought to a process named indicator-application-service because it was idling at 28% CPU usage. What does this program do?\n\nA: indicator-application-service is the service that is used to manage application indicators.    Application indicators are a way for applications that don't provide any indicator integration with any of the existing indicators such as Messaging, Session, DateTime, etc.  You can think of it as the replacement for the former systray.  \nApplications that want to provide status that doesn't fit into the existing categories can register with indicator-application-service and get an icon displayed in the panel.\n\nA: Read here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/indicator-applet\nThe indicator applet exposes Ayatana Indicators in the Gnome Panel.

I know you can suspend a ssh session with ~^z, but is there also a way to background it so that it continues working while you do something else in the local shell?\n\nA: After ~^z execute bg and the stopped process will continue to execute in background. Works with all processes not just ssh.\nP.S.: With fg you foreground the backgrounded process again. And just for the record: The ~ is only needed to distinguish whether the suspension should be on the local machine (with ~ --> the ssh client) or on the server (without ~ --> whatever process is currently running in foreground on the server)\n\nA: If you're trying to run a process remotely, and you don't care about keeping the ssh session open, you may want to look at using screen.  It will allow you to run your process in the \"background\", and it will keep running after you logout.\nFirst, ssh over to the remote box, then from there use screen and start your process, and you can give your screen a session name if you want.  You won't really notice anything different, but start your process in that session.  You can than exit out of the screen session by using the command Ctrl-a d.  It will look something like this:\nuser@remotebox:~$ screen -S foobarsession\nuser@remotebox:~$ startmyprocess\n[detached from 4865.foobarsession]\nuser@remotebox:~$\n\nYou can then exit out of your ssh session, and the process will keep running.  To reconnect to the screen session later on, ssh back to the remote box and use screen -r to reconnect.  You can use screen -ls to list the sessions.\nuser@remotebox:~$ screen -ls\nThere is a screen on:\n        4865.foobarsession     (10/05/2012 11:10:57 AM)     (Detached)\n1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-user\nuser@remotebox:~$ screen -r foobarsession\nuser@remotebox:~$ screen -ls\n        4865.foobarsession     (10/05/2012 11:10:57 AM)     (Attached)\n1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-user\nuser@remotebox:~$\n\nOr, if screen isn't installed, you could use the nohup command on the remote box.  Wikipedia explains that well:\nNohupping backgrounded jobs is typically used to avoid terminating them when logging\noff from a remote SSH session. A different issue that often arises in this situation\nis that ssh is refusing to log off (\"hangs\"), since it refuses to lose any data\nfrom/to the background job(s).  This problem can also be overcome by redirecting all\nthree I/O streams:\n\nnohup ./myprogram > foo.out 2> foo.err < /dev/null &\n\nSo you could do something like:\nssh -n -f user@remotebox \"sh -c 'cd /foo/bar; nohup ./myprogram > foo.out 2> foo.err < /dev/null &'\"\n\n", "Q: How do I remove windows snap in Gnome Fallback Session?

I hope this helps.\n\nA: Connect an ethernet cable, and wait for a prompt to install the wireless driver. If nothing happens after a minute, search for Additional Drivers in the Dash. Anything there? If not, you'll need to post some info about the wireless hardware.

Any other options as specified here do not allow me to boot into Ubuntu. \nMy question is simple, what does setting the parameter acpi=off actually do? \nAnd more importantly does repeatedly booting with acpi=off damage or harm the computer in anyway?\n\nA: Using acpi = off disables your Advanced Configuration and Power Interface\n off temporarily while booting Ubuntu.  If you have to add the acpi = off to let ubuntu boot successfully, it means that the ACPI on your computer isn't compatible with this version of ubuntu.\nI don't think using acpi = off repeatedly wrecks your computer, because it only disables ACPI temporarily.\nHowever, if you don't want to add the acpi = off parameters every time you boot, you can disable the new card (BIOS) or disable ACPI (also from the BIOS).  Use the second option if you can't find the New Card Interface.\nBut, if you have Windows, disabling ACPI from the BIOS may wreck Windows and the computer will force you to reinstall it.  So do that if you have a hidden windows recovery partition in your computer.\n\nA: I've recently purchased a HP Envy 17 j053ea machine to take advantage of the i7 and oodles of memory. Cutting to the chase I suffered from many issues with this install. The wireless didn't work, the screen \"black screened\" during installation and thereafter during booting. The get around for the black screen was the boot option acpi=off, but this of course meant that the laptop would not suspend when I closed the lid which is clearly suboptimal. After searching for the past two days I have found many good articles/explanations of acpi and a much better option:\nFor info on acpi see: http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/ACPI-HOWTO/\nFor more info see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ACPI_modules\nThen I found:\nNo ACPI support for my PC, what can I do? from irrational_john ... way to go .. acpi=ht didn't work but pci=noacpi has done the trick. For your hardware I'd recommend John's approach pf cycling through the options he provided:\nnolapic\nnoapic\nacpi_osi=“Linux”\nacpi_osi=“Windows 2006”\nacpi=ht\npci=noacpi\nacpi=noirq\npnpacpi=off\n\nWith this in hand abd to address “wub's” .. on point answer above, once you find the one that works:\nbash# cd /etc/default\nbash# sudo vi grub\n# Use the vi editor to add the boot options to the line  \n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\n\nand make it (in my case):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=“quiet splash pci=noacpi”\n\nfinish with:\nbash# sudo update-grub\nbash# sudo reboot\n\n\nA: Windows simply does not start without ACPI. I got a Sony laptop 'defect', because there is no way to change ACPI in BIOS, so Sony wanted to replace the motherboard for a huge amount of money. Btw. Windows will not be broken or harmed in any way with no ACPI, it simply does not start.\nLinux Ubuntu 20.04 works fine with that Sony - except - acpi=off disables also the Touch Pad. Tried nolapic and noapic plus acpi=off in all variations. Touch Pad did work but sometimes the Sony hangs in boot, error is non-deterministic. Only sole acpi=off without Touch Pad is stable.\n", "Q: Ubuntu package for alloy analyzer? So I'm experimenting with Ubuntu 12.04 after using ArchLinux for the last 2 years or so.

This is fixed by a reboot to start it all over again. Is there some way I can get rid of this, as I don't have this problem with other systems with Ubuntu?\n\nA: Your computer is processing too many things at once and the things that you are processing may take up a lot of memory which slows down the computer, plus you may be running more than one program.\nThe way you can fix this is by turning off the effects that comes as the default, or you can buy more memory for your computer, or run one thing at a time, which I think is going to be a problem for you because you want to run more than one program at a time. \nSo just get some more memory or turn off the effects in desktop preferences then click on effects and then click none effects, because it works like magic without the full effects on.\n\nA: It seems most the issues are removed upon disabling Composting in the xorg.conf file.

Basically, I have very poor 3D performance on everything OpenGL when using Unity3D. GLXGears gives me an average fps of 33FPS on Unity3D, while using Unity2D gives me an average of 58FPS. So, I was wondering if it's possible to load just Compiz and Unity3D using the llvmpipe software renderer, while still being able to have hardware accelerated OpenGL for everything else, to keep my FPS up, so I can play my games. My graphics hardware is an ATI RS480. I'm using the stock Ubuntu drivers with the extra DRI package installed, as I've found out that using Oibaf's Graphics PPA screws everything OpenGL up for and makes all of the games I play (urban terror, WINE games, OpenArena) not render correctly. In the case of WINE applications, they ALL crash.\n\nA: LLVMpipe is an especially interesting Gallium3D driver since it allows accelerating the state trackers atop any modern CPU, but for any close to decent level of performance when using OpenGL you need a hefty multi-core CPU (here's some LLVMpipe benchmarks just from last week) that supports the latest SSE4 instructions as well. While some OpenGL games will run with LLVMpipe and the performance of this driver that leverages the Low-Level Virtual Machine is much faster and better than Mesa's old software rasterizer or the Gallium3D Softpipe driver, Compiz nor the GNOME Shell (and most other compositing window managers) yet work with this driver.\nSorry, but that means no.\n\nA: which driver are you using? best idea seems to install your drivers with jockey. as far as i know llvmpipe isnt supported yet. i had heard rumors that it will be introduced in ubuntu 12.10. But i wont expect too much from llvmpipe. It is most likely that llvmpipe will be much slower than using the properity drivers.\n\nA: As a curiosity, I did try compiling the Mesa LLVMpipe driver manually on a 12.04 install, then using it with Unity 3D via \"UNITY_FORCE_START=1\" and -- while the performance is pretty decent with LLVMpipe and a modern CPU in a game like Chromium, with Unity 3D a highend machine was slowed to a crawl, with compiz using 25% to 75% of a core @ about 1/2 fps, and gobbling up between 1 and 3 GB of RAM (which, when it peaked, started getting swapped out leaving the machine completely unresponsive).\nIn other words, it's a neat idea, but sadly not practical.\n", "Q: Dell 1390 wireless (BCM4311) Ubuntu 12.04 no wireless icon in unity I have a Dell Inspiron 1520, which has the Dell Wireless 1390 card (based on the BCM4311 chipset).  During installation, Ubuntu 12.04 detected the device and installed the Broadcom STA driver.  However, Unity is not showing an icon for the wireless device, so I am unable to connect to any networks.  Any ideas what I need to do to get this working?\nEdit:\nlspci -v gives the following info\n0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)\n        Subsystem: Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN Mini-Card\n        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 17\n        Memory at fe8fc000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]\n        Capabilities: <access denied>\n        Kernel driver in use: b43-pci-bridge\n        Kernel modules: wl, ssb\n\n/proc/net/dev does not contain any entries for the device, however (it just has lo and eth0 listed).\n\nA: My problem appears to be that in a machine with both a BCM43xx wireless and BCM44xx wired connection, the driver for the wired connection requires the generic 'ssb' module, which grabs the resources needed by both, expecting the final drivers to cooperate with it (?).  Unfortunately, broadcom's 'wl' driver (which is the driver I had installed) does not cooperate in the way it expects; only the open-source 'b43' driver is capable of doing this.\nThis bug seems to be related: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/197558\nA workaround of the same general kind as the one proposed in comment #4 of that bug would presumably have worked for me, but simpler was to switch to using the 'b43' driver rather than 'wl'.  To that end, I blacklisted 'wl'.  Once that was done, I added 'b43' to /etc/modules, and the 'b43' driver then loaded automatically at startup, and everything worked smoothly.\n\nA: Don't know if you're still looking for an answer but the answer here...\nHow to make my Dell 1390 wlan minicard work\n...fixed it for me in a new 12.04 LTS installation on an Inspiron 1520 with the 1390 WLAN card.\nHere are the important commands...\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\nsudo apt-get remove bcmwl-kernel-source\n\n...which worked perfectly for me.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The 3 steps in answer #2 worked for me on my Dell Inspiron 6400 (similar to the 1520) for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, but initially after installing Ubuntu, neither the wired or wireless interfaces would work - so I couldn't update using the commands provided. The solution was to remove the incorrect driver causing the network conflict which I found here: Ubuntu 12.04 Dell 6400 no network\nTo summarize, the three commands to get wired network connectivity was:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo modprobe b44\nreboot\n\nThen I follow the commands in answer #2 and networking (wired and wireless) worked!\n", "Q: 'Device not ready' to D-Link DFE-580TX Wired Network Adapters My 3 Quad port network adapters can be recognised when I write the 'ifconfig' command, but they all seem to be in 'Device not ready' state when I click on the networking tab at the toolbar (please see pictures below).\nAt the 'System Setting' they all seem to be recognised but again, their state doesn't change when I plug a network cable into them.\nCould anybody advise if there is a solution to this problem?

If I remember right, the device (at least for my specific case) required a firmware .bin file in addition to the built-in driver. If this is the case, these firmware files cannot be distributed with Ubuntu because they are proprietary software, and card specific. That's as much help as I can be.\n\nA: killall -9 NetworkManager\n\nUse this command. It kills all processes on network card and restart it. I use it each and every time I use Ubunutu.\n", "Q: Stop Ubuntu From Booting at Start? I have a Dual-Boot HP laptop, with Windows 7 Home Premium and Ubuntu 12.04 installed. I messed up a little with Windows and I had to restore my system to factory configurations by using a backup disc I created using the manager.\nBut when the Recovery Manager finishes copying all the files to the HD, it tells me that it has to  reboot the machine SEVERAL TIMES  in order to get the default OS and drivers installed. But when it first reboots, it automatically boots into the GRUB manager and tells me to select an OS to boot from, AND WINDOWS DOESN'T APPEAR.\nSo, my question is: Is there any way to disable Ubuntu from booting first so that it lets the Recovery Manager to reinstall the files? Or do I have to uninstall Ubuntu completely? If it is the last option, will I still be able to start the Recovery Manager WITHOUT any OS? Or is my machine perpetually doomed?\nAny explanation or links to tutorials will be really appreciated.\nBTW, Ubuntu starts without any problem, it seems that re-formatting the hard drive doesn't affect it -.- \n\nA: Hmm. This is odd. Technically, GRUB should have been overwritten with the Windows Boot loader. Anyway, GRUB is probably confused because of your OS restore. Um, the best thing I can offer is to try this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair#A1st_option_:_get_a_CD_including_Boot-Repair\nIf Windows has a proper presence on your hard drive(s), using this tool should allow GRUB to fix itself and add it back to the boot menu. Otherwise, you will need to do a clean (read: install windows from scratch, NOT FROM A RESTORE DISC), make sure you partition enough space for both Win and Ubuntu, and then install Ubuntu once your windows install is complete. \n\n*Not sure If I can put this here, so remove if it violates rules (which it might, sorry)\nIf you only have Windows restore discs, like the ones that come with the computer, you can obtain a new retail disc image using bit-torrent. As far as I know, as long as you download the same version of windows for which you have a product key for, It's technically not illegal. Anyway, I have a feeling this is violating rules. if it is, my bad, and please edit,\n\nA: Just to add to Ryan's answer, if after restoring or reinstalling Windows you lose your GRUB2 for Linux (which is usually what happens), you don't need to reinstall Ubuntu. Instead, type the following in terminal (using your Live CD):\nsudo fdisk -l (to check what partition Linux is in)\nsudo mount /dev/sdax /mnt (sdax is your Linux partition - replace x for whatever is appropriate in your case)\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ / dev/sda (sda contains all your partitions)\n\n", "Q: Why does \"ping\" work,  but \"ping -R\" fails? Ping www.google.com works, but ping -R www.google.com fails. Why?\n\nA: It works for me as well as it is supposed to work. \nAccording to the man page:\n\"Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such routes.  \n Many hosts ignore or discard this option.\"\n\nSo, if the route is more than 9 hops, including your local machine, then that's all you'll ever see is the first 9.\n\nA: ping -R is a kind of poor-man's-traceroute, which sets the RECORD_ROUTE flag in the packets send, asking each host along the way to return the path taken by the packet at that point.\nAs Marty noted, the maximum length that may be recorded is nine hops, and many hosts may simply ignore this flag.\nTry traceroute or mtr instead if you want to find out the route your ICMP (ping) packets are taking on their way to google.com\n\nA: Some sites may consider such requests as a potential security problem as they reveal network connectivity information possibly useful for an attacker. They may therefore drop the packets silently.\nMany sites disallow traceroute functionality as well for the same reason.\n", "Q: Ctrl-Z equivalent for GUI Programs? I often have to run the update manager on a slow connection, and while reading my emails, I meanwhile would like to surf for 2 minutes in the web, then have the full bandwidth again for the update manager. \nFrom the command line, I can suspend a running process with Ctrl+Z, aka suspend. But if I didn't start the program from the shell - can I do it with some signal and the kill command? \nI read the man page for signal (man -a signal), but there I didn't find a SIGSUSPEND, only SIGSTOP, SIGTERM, SIGINT and such - which is appropriate, or is there none? \n\nA: For the general case you can stop (suspend a process or process group as below):\nControl-Z is\nkill pidnumber -SIGSTOP\nto continue:\nkill pidnumber -SIGCONT\nAlternatively, to suspend an entire process group:\nkill -groupnumber -SIGSTOP\nand\nkill -groupnumber -SIGCONT\nOf course if you suspend a process with some element that is timed, it may not continue properly. In the use case mentioned, the repository server is timing data transfer acknowledgments, it can time-out the transfer because your client has 'gone away' or slow it down because there is 'network congestion'.\nI certainly wouldn't suspend update-manager while it was updating my packages, either.\n", "Q: Keeping installed programs when installing new OS I currently have a separate partition for / and /home. However, in the past I've had a separate /usr for all my installed programs. Whenever I change between similar OSs (eg Mint and Ubuntu) I simply reinstall and format my / only, keeping files and programs. I am looking for a way to migrate all my programs to /usr without having to redownload packages.\n\nA: If you kept the same copies of the files in /usr, that would be unlikely to work correctly, and to some extent it would defeat the purpose of installing a new OS. For Linux, a \"new OS\" essentially means a new version of the files in /usr, so you would be missing out on any improvements or vendor customizations that were made to those programs, and you would have no guarantee that they would be compatible with the configuration files stored in /etc, log files in /var, etc.\nHowever, something similar can be done which is safer and more useful: you can save off the list of all currently installed packages and then restore that list after you install the OS:\nRestoring all data and dependencies from dpkg --set-selections '*'\n", "Q: updating ubuntu!

I'm happy with either something that let's me route to the juju subnet, or to get juju instances to deploy using br0.\nHere's some info on the current network setup:\nroot@ragnarok:~# ifconfig -a\nbr0       Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 0e:31:50:b7:42:15  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.110  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::3ed9:2bff:fe0b:1ee/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:368136 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:448695 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:86744921 (86.7 MB)  TX bytes:225010392 (225.0 MB)\n\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 3c:d9:2b:0b:01:ee  \n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:403922 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:482977 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:121619070 (121.6 MB)  TX bytes:229584532 (229.5 MB)\n          Interrupt:18 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1\n          RX packets:39616 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:39616 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:77037707 (77.0 MB)  TX bytes:77037707 (77.0 MB)\n\nlxcbr0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 42:17:6e:6e:da:02  \n          inet addr:10.0.3.1  Bcast:10.0.3.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::4017:6eff:fe6e:da02/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:268 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:23000 (23.0 KB)\n\nveth6XdwFd Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 92:52:9b:2d:30:be  \n          inet6 addr: fe80::9052:9bff:fe2d:30be/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:15890 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:121216 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:1433414 (1.4 MB)  TX bytes:28807169 (28.8 MB)\n\nvethsUH9q7 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 0e:31:50:b7:42:15  \n          inet6 addr: fe80::c31:50ff:feb7:4215/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:1544 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:100924 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:121236 (121.2 KB)  TX bytes:6347816 (6.3 MB)\n\nvirbr0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00  \n          inet addr:192.168.122.1  Bcast:192.168.122.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:5993 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:11778 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:479255 (479.2 KB)  TX bytes:15580755 (15.5 MB)\n\nroot@ragnarok:~# ip route\ndefault via 192.168.1.1 dev br0  metric 100 \n10.0.3.0/24 dev lxcbr0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.0.3.1 \n192.168.1.0/24 dev br0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.110 \n192.168.122.0/24 dev virbr0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.122.1 \nroot@ragnarok:~# route -n\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 br0\n10.0.3.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 lxcbr0\n192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br0\n192.168.122.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 virbr0\n\n\nA: that use case is not supported at the moment for the local provider. if want to do it by hand, you'd have to modify lxc config for each container and restart the containers after setting it up for your network setup (effectively as another ethernet device setup for dhcp on the local net).\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man5/lxc.conf.5.html\n", "Q: Gnome session has missing letters, transparency issues, blue screen I've install the GNOME desktop with sudo apt-get install gnome, as instructed here.

I find Nautilus' GUI much more to my liking than Unity, and I've been having a lot of problems with Unity, like the menu bar at the top disappearing leaving me with no file specific menus on maximized apps, and no controls for audio volume, no clock, no shutdown menu etc. (have to use power button to pop up Shutdown menu).  Plus Unity seems to run much more slowly than Nautilus - or is that just 12.04 in general? \n\nA: Nautilus is a file manager while Unity is a desktop environment that uses Nautilus as its default file manger and to display the desktop background. As they are quite different things there is no way to replace Unity with Nautilus.\nIf you don't like Unity you may have a look at other desktop environments like Unity 2D (installed by default), Gnome Classic (install package gnome-session-fallback) or the Xubuntu desktop (install package xubuntu-desktop).

I was thinking about setting the old computer up as a thin client and installing LTSP on my main Linux box. But the more I look into it the more it looks overly complicated for what I'm trying to do. I've also looked into xrdp, but I'm kind of at a loss as to how to go about doing this.

To download go here and click on free trial\n\n*Keep Ubuntu installed after you change the partition sizes, and boot from the XP CD, choose repair console and once you get to the command prompt type fixboot c: (if c: is you xp boot drive) and that will make XP boot again.

But now I am unable to locate the section which listed the steps to be followed to recover data from external drive.\nIf some one knows the steps for the same, I request him to share the same.

I will not be installing the Ubuntu but running it in demo mode without actually installing it.\nDesktop computer on which I am running it has Windows XP installed on it. \nI have important and personal files/ photos in it, please help me in recovering it.\nThanks \n\nA: You may start with this guide, but as your PC was unable to even recognize it I'm not too sure about the potential outcome.

After installing Ubuntu 12.04 on my dual boot machine with Mac OS X and Ubuntu I no longer see rEFIt when I start the computer. Mac OS X is listed in the Grub menu but I can't start it from there. So how do I reinstall rEFIt from Ubuntu? The documentation only explains how to install rEFIt from OS X.\n\nA: I fixed the problem by starting OS X from the installation DVD and setting the startup disk (in the Utilities menu) to the Mac OS X partition.

I do exactly what it says in the vicious README, but when I reload the configuration file, no widgets are added to the top bar. So for example, I add:\nrequire(\"vicious\")\n\nat the top (after moving the vicious directory in ~/.config/awesome/) and:\n-- Initialize widget\ncpuwidget = widget({ type = \"textbox\" })\n-- Register widget\nvicious.register(cpuwidget, vicious.widgets.cpu, \"$1%\")\n\nlater in the config file. I reload the configuration file, and nothing changes.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: You've created and registered the widget, but you've not actually told Awesome where to put the widget.  You might assume it should know you want it in the default \"panel\", but actually you can put it in other places (like if you set up a second panel at the bottom).  \nIn the default rc.lua (and yours hopefully, if it's not been too customized), there should be a part that says something about creating a wibox: \n -- Create the wibox\n mywibox[s] = awful.wibox({\n         fg = beautiful.fg_normal, bg = beautiful.bg_normal,\n         border_color = beautiful.border_focus,\n         --border_width = beautiful.border_width,\n         position = \"top\",\n         --height = 20,\n         screen = s\n         })\n\n[Note there is an 's' variable due to that portion being in a 'for' loop.  Same for the next code block below. ]  Then you add the widgets you've defined to the wibox as follows:\n -- Add widgets to the wibox - order matters\n mywibox[s].widgets = {\n     {\n         mylauncher,\n         mytaglist[s], spacer,\n         mylayoutbox[s],\n         layout = awful.widget.layout.horizontal.leftright\n     },\n     mytextclock, separator,\n     volwidget, volicon, separator,\n     mailinfo, mailicon, separator,\n     s == 1 and mysystray or nil,\n     separator, upicon, netwidget, dnicon,\n     -- mytasklist[s],\n     layout = awful.widget.layout.horizontal.rightleft\n }\n\nThese are not all vicious widgets but some default ones and ones I've defined.  I have one set of widgets starting from the left edge of the screen and another starting from the right edge.  My tasklist used to be in the middle of the panel but I've commented it out, since now I put a tasklist on a bottom panel and use conky in the middle of the top panel.\n", "Q: Dual booting Windows and Ubuntu My laptop has 500gb hard disk in which for 250gb I installed Windows xp on C drive(primary partition).

I often have to boot into OS X mode and use Xcode and so on for some Phonegap iOS development but it would be much easier to just edit the Javascript files I'm working on in Ubuntu, if that were possible. I know it is at least possible to access the files in read only without jailbreaking, but that was on OS X with third party software.\nExperimenting ifuse has so far been a failure - only yielding access to a few things, not the /var/ folder I need, and it looks like it's author stopped working on it 2 years ago.\n\nA: That is the whole idea of jail breaking: the ability to edit files on the disc that are owned by root. Either you jailbreak the iPad and you can edit the files in /var directly or you can not.\nUnless you find out the root password ;)\n\nRegarding the link in comment. \nThere are 3 situations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The software you get when you buy Apple products.\n\n*3rd party software that replaces the software Apple put on the device and enhance the current features. These use the permissions and or directories that are already open on the device. This includes (but is not limited to) tethering (browsing over the iPad; basically this is telling the kernel to use a module), adding music or pictures, manage installed applications, synch  addressbook/calendars/notes and bookmarks. These things can be added without having root access. They add files to userspace.\n\n*Software Apple does not want you to install on the device. These are for instance rootkits, ssh and/or telnet connections. These require you to jailbreak so you can become the root user of the device. \nThe partition where /var/ is located is most likely mounted as Read Only (heck you can even assume that the whole system is mounted Read Only and only the user partition is Read/Write). To change this you need to jailbreak: then you can umount the partition, remount it as read-write and change content to it. Any Apple product that is capable of writing to /var/ (if they even make this possible) is more than likely going to do something similar: remount the partition to read-write , write the files and remount read-only whilst making sure along the way it is done with untampered software Apple wrote.\n", "Q: Not receiving Ubuntu One verification code Its been a three months now that I have signed up for Ubuntu One, but cannot use it because I am not receiving the verification code.\nShould I try with another email?

They work perfectly on Ubuntu 10.04. Why? How to fix? I have a set of motorola s305 bluetooth head phones.  These head phones work PERFECTLY on ubuntu 10.04 64bit (high and low quality, microphone as well).  I tried Ubuntu 11.04 and the head phones cause a kernel panic (among other problems).  Reading the forums and bug lists, this might not be due to these specific head phones.  \nI have now installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a Asus K53s series and the head phones are both visible and connect, however, there is no sound.  With Ubuntu 11.04, sound was possible but only low quality (HSP/HFP) no high quality (A2SP).  With Ubuntu 12.04, both HSP/HFP and A2SP show up in the options but when I switch to the head phones as output in the sound preferences there is no sound.  \nIm using a Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode).  hciconfig shows the following:\nhci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB\n    BD Address: AE:2D:22:00:FF:00  ACL MTU: 344:12  SCO MTU: 180:16\n    UP RUNNING PSCAN \n    RX bytes:814 acl:0 sco:0 events:32 errors:0\n    TX bytes:634 acl:0 sco:0 commands:32 errors:0 \n\nThere seems to be bug here.

I'm using an HP 635 Notebook PC for the record.\nThanks.\n\n\nA: All the options are grayed out because the partition you're trying to resize is mounted and is a root partition. Any partition has to be unmounted before resize/move/delete and there's no way to unmount root partition while running Ubuntu. Whereas you can mount other partitions by simply right click and select unmount. So boot from a Live CD/USB and then you can resize the root partition but make sure to backup you data before doing so.\n", "Q: Where are passwords saved? This is a weird question to ask, but where are the passwords saved? I mean they must be somewhere for comparing every time. So where are system and network passwords saved?\n\nA: System account passwords can be found in /etc/shadow. You need root privileges to read the file. The passwords are hashed with SHA. Additional information can be found on the corresponding manpages.\nNetwork or wifi passwords can be found in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections. There is a file for each connection with its configuration, also you need root privileges to read them but the password isn't encrypted.\nPasswords handled by Gnome's password store, the Gnome Keyring, are stored in ~/.gnome2/keyrings. The files are not human readable and should be accessed with Gnome's default password manager Seahorse. On older systems (before precise/12.04) wifi passwords were stored in Gnome Keyring and PINs for Mobile Broadband are still stored there.\n", "Q: How do I copy program files from Windows partition to my Ubuntu partition I am dual-booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 and I play World of Warcraft on my Windows OS.

So how do I copy WoW in the wine directory?\n\nA: For the purpose you want, you actually do not need to copy the files over. you can run WOW from within the windows partition. What you really have to do is the following to have everything working as it should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the PPA for WINE. You HAVE TO install the PPA which is much better. More info here: How to update Wine to the latest version?\n\n*Install using winetricks (After having installed Wine) all DirectX 9 components. Since the release of Wine 1.4, you can just install the DirectX that comes with any Windows CD/DVD (eg: The DirectX 10 that comes with Skyrim). That should be enough to get DirectX working.\n\n*Install the latest drivers for Intel, Nvidia or Ati. All of which you can find/install with this PPA: How do I install the latest Nvidia drivers via the Additional Drivers tool?\n\n*Follow this link with any additional relevant information about WoW: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=25610\n\n*Create a desktop shortcut/launcher as mentioned in this question to have a working one click icon: How can I edit/create new launcher items in Unity by hand? (Easy way here: https://askubuntu.com/a/128284/7035 )\n\n*Edit the Desktop shortcut and in the command line type: wine \"DIR\" -opengl where DIR is the complete location of your Wow.exe file. For example in my case wine \"/media/fun/games/World of Warcraft/Wow.exe\" -opengl\". The OpenGL is to give you more available graphics options. You can also remove it but for most video cards it is better to have it there to make the game run smoother.\nIf you still want to copy the Wow folder, you can put it on your Ubuntu home folder and do the same steps mentioned before. Just wanted to point out that you can run the game from the same Windows partition, does saving you space and time.\n\nA: Quoting from Wine's FAQ:\nShort answer: you have to install them in Wine just like you did in Windows.

I moved my home directory to a subdirectory of a second (mounted) drive using usermod -d ... -m.  Now, most programs work fine, but a few (Dropbox, etc.) do not.  I believe this is because there is no /home/myuser directory any more, so programs that are hard-coded to look there fail.\nCan I just create a hard link using ln -d?  It seems like hard links are problematic, and I'm not even sure if I can create them across disks anyhow.  But I'd like to get this sorted out soon.\n\nA: Hard links in general are not particularly problematic. But hard links to directories are, which is why you have to use the -d flag to attempt to make one, and why you will probably not succeed anyway; the kernel is probably configured (or hard-coded, I'm not sure) to prohibit them.\nFurthermore, as you've suspected you cannot hard link anything across volumes, so you won't be able to hard link /home/myuser to a directory on a different partition.\nThere are two types of links supported by the ln command--hard links, and soft links (also called symbolic links or symlinks).\nA hard link to a file is the file. When you make a hard link, you're making it so that another filename identifies the file. Files in a Unix-style filesystem (like ext4, which Ubuntu uses by default) are identified uniquely by their inode number. When a file has multiple names, that is, multiple hard links (or, we can say, just multiple links), it continues to exist even if one or more of them are deleted, so long as at least one remains. (Then it continues to exist on disk until it is no longer open by any process.) The name of the low-level system function that does the work of rm is called unlink for this reason.\nA soft link is not the file. It is instead a special kind of filesystem entry that points to a file by the target file's location and name. If you delete a file pointed to by a soft link, the soft link does not cause the file to continue to exist. If you delete or move/rename a file pointed to by a soft link, the soft link stops working to access the file, and is said to be broken.\nHard linking files across volumes does not work because a hard link is the file, and must be on the volume where the file's data is physically stored.\nHard linking directories (that is, having more than one name corresponding to the same directory inode) is generally a bad idea, and is usually prohibited, because it makes it possible to break basic (and reasonable) assumptions about how directories behave. For example, suppose I am in a directory called foo and I cd to a directory called bar. If directory hard links are not allowed, then I know I can get back to foo with cd ... But if directory hard links are allowed, then bar could actually be a hard link to a directory somewhere else. Furthermore, and much more seriously, a hard link is the file, and a hard link to a directory is the directory, so there can then be ambiguity about what directory really is the parent of bar.\nOn the other hand, soft links to directories are perfectly permitted. A directory foo can contain a soft link called bar which links to a directory somewhere else, but this doesn't cause problems because it is always clear what to do. It is always clear because there is an answer to the question what directory am I in really? So when you are treating the present working directory as the name you used to get there, it's the name of the symbolic link. And when you need to know what directory you're really in (for example, to compare two different paths to see if they're the same or one resides in the other), that works too.\nSo, you can make a soft link, or symbolic link, from /home/myuser to the new home directory. To make a soft link, use ln -s target source. You do not need to (and should not) specify the -d flag to make a directory soft link.\nThat might help ameliorate your problem. You could try it. But it would be even better to fix the problem itself. I recommend that you post a new question asking for how to solve the problem of some of your programs not working properly since you migrated your home directory to another partition (assuming that's what you did). Make sure to include specific information about all the programs that are having problems, including the full and exact text of any error messages, and also a description of exactly what changes you made to your Ubuntu configuration that triggered these problems and the complete contents of /etc/fstab and the output of echo $USER $HOME. (You should also link to this question, so people don't answer telling you just work around the problem by making a symbolic link.)\n\nA: Don't do a hard link.  Do a symbolic link.  ln -s /path/to/home /path/to/link.  Hard links can cause problems, especially when it's to a directory.\n", "Q: Will dual booting Ubuntu alongside Windows affect Windows recovery or overall processing speed? I want to install Ubuntu 11.10 on Lenovo y560 as a dual boot alongside Windows 7. Will this installation harm the auto recovery of Windows 7 and how will it effect the processing speed?\n\nA: No, it will not. Auto recovery is a Windows thing and does not get affected by Ubuntu. \nUbuntu and Windows are 2 separate entities that can fully use all of the resources available in a dual boot. The only perfomance hit you will see is a 1 or 2 seconds delay during boot since you will have grub installed and the option to choose to start either Ubuntu or Windows. \nOnly when you install 1 (guest) of the 2 into the other OS (host) with VM Ware or Vitualbox will the guest OS suffer a performance penalty since the host will take away some performance. \n", "Q: How do I make a Matlab launcher for Unity? I'm trying to install a Matlab R2011a launcher for Unity in Ubuntu 12.04. I've tried this guide (although I know it's for 11.10 and mentions that even 11.10 is an unsupported OS for Matlab R2011a) but without any satisfactory solution.\nThis is my launcher file, /usr/share/applications/matlab.desktop:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/matlab.png\nName=MATLAB R2011a\nComment=Start MATLAB - The Language of Technical Computing\nExec=matlab -desktop\nCategories=Development;\n\nI open the dash panel and search for \"matlab\". This launcher is found among applications. I click it, and Matlab's splash screen shows up, but when it disappears the program doesn't start. (I've verified with htop that no matlab-processes are running in the background either.)\nIf I add\nTerminal=true\n\nto the launcher file, the program starts OK, and opens a terminal as well as Matlab. However, both the terminal and Matlab itself show up in the Launcher area, with the Matlab icon, so it looks like I have two Matlab instances running when really it's only one. (Actually, they show up as two different programs, and not just two instances of the same - the icons are independent, not grouped together.)\nThis is definitely not optimal. I had hoped to create a launcher I can lock to the launcher area, and then that same icon will be the icon for the active Matlab instance when the program is running.\nHow do I create a launcher for Matlab that works as expected?\nUpdate: I was apparently a bit unclear on my symptoms, I'll try to clarify a little.\nI've also tried some suggestions from the answers, and further investigated what happens. My current setup (a launcher file with Terminal=true and Exec=matlab -desktop -nosplash &) renders the following behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*I open Dash by pressing the Windows key on my laptop, and search for \"matlab\". It finds the launcher named \"MATLAB R2011a\". I click it.\n\n*A terminal window opens, using the icon I referred to in the launcher file. Almost immediately, MATLAB's splash screen also opens, using the same icon (and thus being grouped with the terminal window in the launcher).\n\n*The splash screen disappears and, so does one of the icons in the launcher. The MATLAB desktop environment opens, using a different version of the icon which is displayed next to the icon for the terminal window (not grouped with it).\n\n\nI can lock the terminal window's icon to the launcher and successfully start MATLAB by clicking it, but it doesn't feel optimal that I start the program with one icon, and switch to it with another. I've also tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exec without the ampersand & in the launcher command, but it didn't make a difference.\n\n*Executing matlab -nosplash manually from a terminal still shows the splash screen. (What, then, does the nosplash option really do?)\n\n\nA: That's very odd. matlab -desktop really ought to do the trick.\nApproach 1: see what's wrong with the launcher\nI have a working MATLAB icon in my Unity sidebar. I can click it, it maintains the correct icon and doesn't open a terminal. As far as I can see it is pretty much the same as your code, though:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2011b/bin/matlab -desktop\nName=MATLAB\nIcon=/home/tomas/icons/Matlab_Logo.png\n\nThe above code is in matlab.desktop, which is placed in /usr/share/applications/.\nThe only differences I see that could matter are (i) the Exec path, but if you installed symlinks during your MATLAB installations yours should work just fine and (ii) I'm running MATLAB R2011b.\nLike you, I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.\nIn case I missed something, you could try to use my code to start MATLAB, who knows, it might work.\nApproach 2: a dirty workaround with the terminal\nYou mentioned entering matlab -desktop in the terminal works (i.e. adding Terminal=true). However, that gives you two screens grouped under the MATLAB.\nYou could try to fix this by changing how you call the process. The key here would be the ampersand & symbol. What that does is execute the preceding code, not waiting for it to finish. Ideally, it would start the terminal, let the terminal start MATLAB and immediate close the terminal, leaving MATLAB running. What happens if you start matlab from the terminal with the ampersand after the line, or:\nmatlab -desktop &\n\nIf that works, you could try (i) making a launcher with Terminal=true and the above code or (ii) making a launcher that refers to a bash script, which in turn calls the above code.\nFor you, Approach 1 didn't help. If Approach 2 doesn't work either it might be good to play around a bit, see what you can and cannot do with the ampersand, terminal and bash scripts. I'm pretty much out of good ideas, but someone smarter than me might be able to help you out then.\n\nA: I installed a Matlab Configuration file/script from the Software Center. It lists the Matlab launcher in the dash and works perfectly for Matlab2011a in Ubuntu 12.04. But it is not working from the launcher. I mean, if you lock it on the launcher and try to start it from there then it won't work, at least it is not working for me. So I have to start it from the dash. \nTo install this, go to the Ubuntu Software Center, search for the Matlab, it should be the first one on the list (the icon is a Matlab logo). Just install it, and it will take care the rest.\n\nA: Here's what I did to get things working correctly starting with a fresh install (version R2010b on Ubuntu 12.04).\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the matlab-support package from the software center as suggested. Or you can use the following command: sudo apt-get install matlab-support.\n\n*Create a local .desktop file: gedit ~/.local/share/applications/matlab.desktop. For some reason saving it in /usr/share/applications caused it to not work when I would first log in.\n\n*Copy and Paste the following code and save. The important change is the StartupWMClass line.\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/matlab.png\nName=Matlab\nComment=Start MATLAB - The Language of Technical Computing\nExec=matlab -desktop\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Development;\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=com-mathworks-util-PostVMInit\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=New_Window;\n\n[New_Window Shortcut Group]\nName=New Matlab\nExec=matlab -desktop\n\n\n*Open the applications folder where you just saved the matlab.desktop file: nautilus ~/.local/share/applications.\n\n*Drag and Drop the matlab.desktop file to the unity launcher.\n\nA: Garrett's answer almost works for me, but instead I have to use\nStartupWMClass=sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer\n\nThis still gives an extra launcher icon while the splashscreen is visible (because the WM_CLASS of the spashscreen is just \"MATLAB\"), but then the window gets properly grouped under the launcher.\nNew instances of Matlab (started by terminal, or Synapse, or from another tty with export DISPLAY=:0) also get grouped under this launcher, and the launcher's quit option kills all of them.\nI found this WM_CLASS value by using\n$ xprop WM_CLASS\n\nand then clicking on the Matlab window, a command  I got from Superuser.\nTo prevent the temporary extra launcher icon, you can also add the -nosplash flag after the -desktop one.\nSo, my ~/.local/share/applications/MATLAB.desktop looks like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nIcon=matlab\nName=Matlab\nComment=Start MATLAB - The Language of Technical Computing\nExec=matlab -desktop -nosplash\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Development;\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=New_Window;\n\nName[en_US]=MATLAB\n\n[New_Window Shortcut Group]\nName=start a new MATLAB instance\nExec=matlab -desktop\n\nThis is on Ubuntu 12.10, with Matlab R2012b\n\nA: I am maybe coming to this a little late, but I have managed to do this by adding an entry to the 'Main Menu' application. I listed it as an 'Application' and then provided the full path to the executable in the MATLAB directory as the Command.\nI also had to add the flag '-desktop' (without quotes). In addition, I also had to use the '-glnx86' flag as I'm using the Student Version on a 64bit system, but that has also worked fine.\nI then managed to get an icon from this website.\nThis can then be located in the application menu and dragged down into the launcher. The only thing that is acting a little strange is that when I click on it, another MATLAB icon appears in the launcher instead of just making use of the one already there. If anyone can find a way to solve this then that would be great... but I can live with it as it is.\n", "Q: Corrupted MBR, MBR repair does not recognise Alright here's how I got to this point.\nI tried to partition my external drive so that I could install multiple OS's on it, 3 linux distros, 1 being ubuntu, and a partition for windows.\nSo I used Gparted and the drives came out fine according to it, but when I booted into windows to check from their it showed most of them as raw, so thinking something went wrong I decided to boot into Gparted again and just create a new partition table and start making new partitions again. Now after I created the new partition table all things just started going to hell and I finally realized I somehow screwed up the MBR.\nNow the drive isn't recognized by Gparted half the time and it is unable to do anything to it.\nSo one person recommended I use MBR Repair to repair the MBR so I said sure, downloaded it and booted into it, and it recognized all my drives but the one with the corrupt mbr.\nI've read you can manually repair the MBR and there are a few other tools that may be slightly better than MBR Repair but I figured I'd come here for a sound opinion.\nI also read something about somebody using the same make drive to copy it's mbr and just replace the corrupted drives mbr, which makes me wonder, since I have ; Seagate 500 Gig Goflex (Corrupted MBR), Seagate 500 Gig desktop FreeAgent (Fine) and a Seagate 250 Gig Portable Expansion drive (Fine).\n\nA: I don't think anything was wrong with your MBR or your drive when the newly created partitions showed up as raw. I'm afraid I don't know why it sometimes can't be selected by the drop down menu in gparted. Some background may help you understand what should be happening, however.\nFirst: the MBR. For an external drive the MBR is only a container for the primary partition table. That table takes up most of the last 64 bytes of the MBR, which is itself the first 512 bytes of data on the drive.\nFor a bootable drive the MBR contains code to load the beginning of grub, or to load the beginning of the first bootable partition (e.g. Windows or DOS). The latter is usually pretty interchangeable and you can use the Windows utilities to replace a vanilla one for that matter. If the drive needs something special there, however, it could use a special manufacturer provided MBR. For recent drives that's probably pretty unusual.\nWhen you used gparted you specified a type for each partition. You should make sure that those are correct.\nThe partitions are raw until you create file systems on them. They can be Ext 3, for Unix, or NTFS or a version of FAT for Windows. For Ubuntu this is usually done by the Ubuntu installer. gparted wrote a new primary partition table at the end of the external disks MBR, and maybe wrote some other partition information elsewhere if you defined any external partitions. The Ubuntu installer will fill the partitions you tell it to with the file systems you tell it to create, wiping out any data there. Then they will no longer be raw (though the swap one will be).\nWhen installing Ubuntu the system will also want to install GRUB2 to produce a boot window to select what system to boot. By default this goes on the primary disk (the one the system boots from). This changes the code in the first part of the MBR on that drive and installs Grub2 on some (usually) free space between the MBR and the end of the first track. (The MBR is the first sector of the first track of a drive). \nGrub could also be installed on the MBR on secondary disk if you can tell your BIOS to boot from there. \nIt can also be installed into partitions on the secondary disk. If you do that you need to be sure the code in the MBR is good, the one installed by Windows would work fine. The partition with Grub installed would have to be marked as the bootable one.\nWhen you are booting Windows, Grub finds the partition it is on and then loads the first sector of its partition, just like the original MBR did. When booting a Linux kernel Grub actually loads the whole kernel and starts it up.\nSince the primary partition table takes up most of the last 64 of the last 66 bytes of the MBR you can't simply use a sector copy to replace it without wiping out your partition table. If you've done that, however, you should be able to use gparted to recreate it. gparted shouldn't wipe out the code part of the MBR in any case.\n\nA: Copying an MBR from One Drive to Another\nThis will wipe out the partition information, and therfore all of the information, on the target drive. If, by chance, the whole target drive contains a file system (the target drive is unpartitioned but formatted) it will wipe out that file system. Don't do this if you have any doubts and even then be sure you specify the drive names correctly.\nIf you want to try to copy an MBR from one drive to another, say from /dev/hda to /dev/sga here's one way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the drive itself, and any partitions on it, are unmounted. You can use the file folder right below the Window Dash button to see what is mounted and unmount anything that is mounted. It's in the sidebar under Devices on the top left. Click on the little eject button to unmount. If anything is mounted on the target drive I wouldn't expect to be able to write to the MBR using the method below, with an MBR recovery tool, or with gparted. This might be a good time to see if gparted can access the drive reliably.\n\n*Open a terminal window. Enter the mount command without arguments to display everything mounted to be doubly sure nothing is mounted on the target drive.\n\n*Enter a command similar to sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sga bs=512 count=1, substituting /dev/sda with the source drive and /dev/sga with the target drive. This should copy the first sector of of the first drive to the first sector of the second. if= specifies the source and of= specifies the output.\n\n\nA: The MBR is not the problem since you created a fresh one with gparted already, and even if it were wrong, would not make the whole drive not show up.  Either there is a problem with the drive itself or the connection to it.  Open the disk utility and run the SMART diagnostics on the drive.\n", "Q: Ubuntu not finishing installing after reboot from windows installer I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my desktop from the windows installer. It installs but once it finishes and says to reboot, I reboot my computer, and it gives me this:\nTRY(HD0,0): NTFS5: No wuildr \nTRY(HD0,1): NTFS5: No wuildr\nTRY(HD0,2): NTFS5: No wuildr \nTRY(HD0,3): NTFS5: No Wuildr \nTry(fd0) :FAT32: no WUBILDR \nCannot find GRLDR.\n\nIt had once installed but never actually loaded so I uninstalled and reinstalled it and this is what I get now:\nit is a 64 bit windows 7 operating system\n\n\nA: Had this exact issue (64 bit Windows etc.). Found the fix here: http://ubuntu-with-wubi.blogspot.com/2011/01/wubildr-wubildrmbr-and-grldr.html . In short, just copy all the wubildr files from the C:\\ubuntu\\winboot folder and paste into the root of your C drive. In my case, wubildr.mbr still existed in C; I decided not to overwrite. Everything else was missing. Reboot, and everything should be back to normal. \n", "Q: I can not install any software I am new to Ubuntu. During installation of software from Ubuntu software center it shows that there is no internet connection whereas I can access to any website. Using terminal the same problem appears. I installed Ubuntu 12.04 by windows installer. How can I solve the problem?  \n\nA: Change the servers for downloading updates in the software sources to Main server and try if this fixes it.\n\nYou get here by going to the top left with your cursor (go to the text software sources) and choose edit, prefences.\nAfter opening the Software Sources Window select the \"Download From\" option and the last option let's you select a new server. You can choose to do a automatic \"best server for you\" method which checks which server is closer to you or a manual selection where you can select a server from a list.\n", "Q: Can I safely remove software sources added by software-center? In software sources I have two entries that say Added by software-center; credentials stored in /etc/apt/auth.conf.\nI can see on the URIs that they are sources for software I have bought (for 0 $) in the Software Center, and removed again.\nNow I have a lot of sources, as I experiment with some PPAs, so updating them ís not as fast anymore, so I would like to know if I can safely remove these entries, and still be able to install the software again later?\n\nA: When I asked this question, I was afraid something weird would happen if I deleted the sources, that would require bothersome manual fixing and stuff.\nLater I tried to add a PPA from command line twice, and got garbage lines in the corresponding .list file (located in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/), and I imagined something similar could happen with the sources added automatically when you buy software from the software centre, having disabled or deleted the source. Now I'm (mostly) done with my exams, and have found time to experiment with this myself.\nThe result of installing bought software again, after having removed it, and disabled the source, is that it just creates an identical source upon installing the software again (The identical source of course being enabled, contrary to the one that was already there). Upon this I drew the following conclusion:\nIt is safe to remove software sources for software bought in the software centre completely.\nI double checked this by removing (instead of just disabling) the two sources I had (one enabled, and one disabled) after my second installation of some software I bought previously, and then installed it again. Worked flawlessly.\nI tested this with both 0$ and > 0$ software in the Software Centre.\n\nA: Removing unused repos should be ok, but I don't know if the software will stll be free if you decide to reinstall it later.\n", "Q: Unable to install any updates through update manager/apt-get upgrade I have been running Ubuntu 12.04 for the past few weeks.

Recently I've been getting a rather annoying problem, which seems to be linked to Firefox-Trunk, Thunderbird-Trunk, or possible Compiz (default 12.04 compiz with Unity). At random (it seems) the system becomes unusable because the RAM is suddenly full.\nI thought it was a Firefox only problem (with Google+ - if you scroll it was doing this), but further investigation revealed other potential causes. I've since disabled all addons and the problem has not yet occured (at the time of writing) - but I'm waiting to see - because I had to start KDM just to log in (Lightdm freezes now thanks to having to kill the xserver twice).\nPreramble aside - is there a way that I can track what process is going out of hand (maybe by a log?) so I can fix it later?\n\nA: \nPreramble aside - is there a way that I can track what process is going out of hand (maybe by a log?) so I can fix it later?\n\nIf you suspect it's a specific process, just start it from within a bash script, calling ulimit -v N first, where N is the max virtual memory in kilobytes you want to give it before the kernel kills it. You'll know what it is when it dies ;)\nYou could also try setting a simple cron job which appends the output of ps with specific parameters (for memory) to a log every minute and parse later.\nFinally, try monit (in repos), which monitors processes and can take actions such as killing, restarting, etc. when specific thresholds are exceeded.\n", "Q: Cannot boot after BIOS / UEFI reset to defaults I have a ThinkPad X130e. I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS amd64 on it. All worked fine until yesterday. While diagnosing another issue I reset the BIOS / UEFI to defaults. Afterwards Ubuntu did not boot any more. The ThinkPad shows Operating System not found and that's it.\nDid the BIOS / UEFI reset somehow nuke GRUB? If so how is that possible? How do I fix it?\n\nA: A BIOS reset, voluntary or through an update will wipe the EFI boot entries more often than not.\nTo restore the boot entry one has to use a recovery disc and reinstall grub-efi or grub-efi-amd64. The entry can also be added manually.\nThis question shows a couple of ways to fix it: https://superuser.com/questions/376470/how-to-reinstall-grub2-efi.\n\nA: It's more likely that you switched a boot option from (U)EFI mode to BIOS mode or vice-versa. The two boot modes are entirely different, and if the firmware looks for one type of boot loader when it's not present but the other type is installed, you'll get an error like the one you described.\nTo fix this, I recommend you enter your firmware setup utility and look for any options that refer to \"EFI\", \"UEFI\", or \"legacy boot\". Once you've identified all such options, try to figure out which one is the best candidate for experimenting and change it.\n", "Q: Failed upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 on an encrypted filesystem Okay, so I was running Ubuntu 11.10 with a dm-crypt/LUKS encrypted file-system and just tried to update to 12.04 with the Update Manager.\nIt downloaded all the necessary packages and started installing them and suddenly got this error with libc6 : I'm upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04, and the installation is stuck at preparing libc6\nBecause of this, I had a reboot in the middle of the upgrade because it clearly seemed to have completely crashed.\nAfter that, I can no longer boot Ubuntu.

Some Windows applications work better under an older version of WINE. From time to time it is even necessary to use a previous WINE version in order to get an application to start. However, the repository provides only one version of it, and it may require some hassle to downgrade it.\nWhat is the best way of installing an older version of WINE?\n\nA: I have been using the development version of wine (winehq-devel) for some time. Recently there was a regression bug when going between v5.21 and v5.22, so one of my applications wouldn't run. Here's what I did to roll back to version 5.21:\nsudo apt-cache policy winehq-devel                        (shows available versions)\nsudo apt-get install wine-devel-amd64=5.21~bionic\nsudo apt-get install wine-devel-i386=5.21~bionic\nsudo apt-get install wine-devel=5.21~bionic\nsudo apt-get install winehq-devel=5.21~bionic\n\nAfter a reboot of the system, version 5.21 is now active, and my application works again.\n\nA: From the Wine FAQ:\n\nCan I install more than one Wine version on my system?\nYes, but you will have to build Wine yourself (see How to compile Wine from source), as it is not possible to have multiple distro packages installed. The easiest way to do this is to run Wine from the build directory (don't do make install). If you want to actually install multiple versions, use --prefix when building Wine to designate a different install directory for each version, e.g.\n./configure prefix=/path/to/install/directory && make \n\nthen install it with\nsudo make install \n\nOn Linux, even this step is not enough: you must also set environment variables so that the wine executable on your $PATH finds the right shared libraries. Assuming that /path/to/install/directory is $W, then for Wine version 1.4, the following settings appear to be sufficient:\nexport WINEVERPATH=$W \nexport PATH=$W/bin:$PATH  \nexport WINESERVER=$W/bin/wineserver  \nexport WINELOADER=$W/bin/wine  \nexport WINEDLLPATH=$W/lib/wine/fakedlls  \nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$W/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\" \n\nThe LD_LIBRARY_PATH is definitely required.\nNote that regardless of whether you install multiple versions or run them from the build directory, you will still have to designate which version of Wine you wish to use when running applications. It is also recommended that applications being run with different Wine versions be installed into separate wineprefixes. \n\n\nA: I can recommend to You to use PlayOnLinux. In this app You can manage Wine version depends which program You want to install, even installed You can change Wine version as You like.\n", "Q: What happens to the automatic crash reports?

Have a look at this example (see the image below). It is a bug about X.Org X server and it has a question to include log files at comment number 2 (apport-collect 921139) and several replies (see #3, #4 and a lot more further down) in there with log files that got collected when the bug was reported. \n\nAt the top of the link you will see how many people are also affected (11 in this case) with this bug and what packages are envolved and what the status is of this bug:\n\n", "Q: enabling a user (created with adduser command) for lightdm graphical login I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64 on a new (empty) hard disk (because the previous crashed)\nSince I am quite familiar with Debian, I created two accounts with the adduser command.\nSince I am also having an NFSv3 file system, I explictly gave user ids when creating them (for simplicity, I keep the same user id on the home server, running Debian; the user names contain digits; I'm not using LDAP), e.g.\n  # grep bethy /etc/passwd\n  bethy46:x:501:501:Bethy XXX,,,06123456:/home/bethy:/bin/bash\n  # grep bethy /etc/group\n  bethy64:x:501:\n  # grep bethy /etc/shadow\n  bethy46:$6$vQ-wmuchmorethings-2o/:15479:0:99999:7::\n\nOf course /home/bethy exists \nThe actual user name is slightly different, and I am not showing the real entries (for obvious privacy reasons)\nHowever, these users don't appear at graphical login prompt (lightdm).\nAnd they exist in the system, they have entries in /etc/passwd & /etc/shadow and I (partly) restored their /home\nI've got no specific user config under /etc/lightdm ; file /etc/lightdm/users.conf mentions\n # NOTE: If you have AccountsService installed on your system, then LightDM\n # will use this instead and these settings will be ignored\n\nbut I have no idea of how to deal with AccountsService thru the command line\nAs you probably guessed, I really dislike doing administrative tasks thru a graphical interface; I much prefer the command line\nWhat did I do wrong? How can a user entry not appear in lightdm graphical login?   (I need to have my wife's user entry apparent for graphical login).\nI am not asking how to hide a user, but how to show it in lightdm graphical prompt\nwork-around\nAs I have been told in comments by Nirmik and by Enzotib, lightdm probably don't show any users of uid less than 1024. So I changed all the uid to be more than 8200 (including on the Debian NFS server) and this made all the users visible at the graphical prompt.\nIt is a pain that such a threshold is not really documented.\n\nA: If there is AccountService running, the file /etc/lightdm/users.conf is ignored. In such case, you can set minimal UID by changing value of attribute UID_MIN in file /etc/login.defs.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. My work around was to disallow lightdm to display valid usernames but rather to ask the user to type in her username. I didn't like that usernames were displayed anyway.\nHappy i was until i noticed that SSHd also suffers from the same problem. I am logged in as xyz and yet when i try to ssh into my PC as xyz, i get a \"Permission denied, please try again.\" And when i check the file /var/log/auth.log i find the following:\nJun  1 01:18:27 mypc sshd[17357]: input_userauth_request: invalid user xyz [preauth]\n\nJun  1 01:18:32 mypc sshd[17357]: error: Could not get shadow information for NOUSER\n\nJun  1 01:18:32 mypc sshd[17357]: Failed password for invalid user xyz from 123.123.123.123 port 57492 ssh2\n\nJun  1 01:18:36 mypc sshd[17357]: Failed password for invalid user xyz from 123.123.123.123 port 57492 ssh2\n\nJun  1 01:18:38 mypc sshd[17357]: Connection closed by 123.123.123.123 [preauth]\n\nAnd yet connecting by SSH using the account with which i installed Ubuntu 12.04 works just fine.\nThe GUI to add new users is over-simplistic. I don't want to have to chown and chgrp all my data. What is the GUI doing that i've left out when editing passwd, group, shadow.\n\nA: Generally the uid 100~999 are reserved for system accounts and those should not\nbe used as normal user's uid, as described by useradd manual\n\nValues between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system accounts.\n\nHence, using uid below 1000 causes lightdm not to show them. Try changing the uid value of the user above 999. (actually above 1000 because, the first user's uid which is you is 1000) For example, to set the uid 1004 use this command:\nsudo usermod --uid 1004 bethy46\n\nThis will change the uid of user bethy46 to 1004 and thus showing in the lightdm user prompt.\nTo know the uid of a user named user use this command:\nid -u user\n\n\nA: This is an old question but comes up when you search for a way to enable users to show up in Debian.  The way I've found to do this in Debian is to create a file in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d called: \n\n01_my.conf\n\n\nUse root privileges.  I use nano but you can do this with gedit or a similar text editor.\n\nmkdir /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d\nnano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/01_my.conf\n\n\nAdd the following:\n\n[Seat:*]\ngreeter-hide-users=false\n\n\nSave your changes, exit and reboot or logout.

This happens after clicking Open, then selecting a directory and clicking OK. The error message is \"NameError: global name 'gtk' is not defined\" So I researched it and found that apparently we need to import a couple things:\nimport pygtk\npygtk.require(\"2.0\")\nimport gtk\n\nIf I add this to the SimpleMediaPlayerWindow.py, then the program won't run at all, giving an error message:\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gobject/constants.py:24: Warning: g_boxed_type_register_static: assertion `g_type_from_name (name) == 0' failed\n  import gobject._gobject\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0/gtk/__init__.py:40: Warning: specified class size for type `PyGtkGenericCellRenderer' is smaller than the parent type's `GtkCellRenderer' class size\n  from gtk import _gtk\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0/gtk/__init__.py:40: Warning: g_type_get_qdata: assertion `node != NULL' failed\n  from gtk import _gtk\n\nI thought all these things were installed and configured properly during the installation of quickly. Any suggestions?\nOn a side note, there are a few typos in the tutorial which may make it slightly difficult to follow. When deleting pre-existing containers from the window, it says \"Navigate the list of children and delete label1\" twice, but the second time it's actually referring to label2. \"Find Horizontal Panes under the Containers tab...\" actually should read \"Find Paned under the Containers tab...\" (maybe this changed with an updated version of glade). Lastly (so far), \"Then add to your on_on_openbutton_clicked function\" there's once too many on's in that function name.\n\nA: You shouldn't be importing both gtk and pygtk, as they will cause conflicts with each other.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem and found that the correct syntax is not\nif response == gtk.RESPONSE_OK.

In 12.04, I have the latest Chromium installed from the Software Centre, but it doesn't have a progress bar.\nIs there one that can be installed / added?\n\nA: This was on the latest daily builds, it's not official, yet.\nAs http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/05/chromium-daily-adds-unity-progress-bar points out, you can download and install that build from https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa\n\nA: If you want the progress bar, you have to symlink the latest libunity.so-file to version 6.\nFor that you would cd /usr/lib and then sudo ln -s libunity.so.9.0.2 libunity.so.6. You might have to replace 9.0.2 with 9.0.1 or a different version that you have installed. The integration should then be available again.\nI retrieved this information from here.\n\nA: Go to /usr/lib: Run the command in terminal:\ncd /usr/lib\nCreate a symbolic link libunity.so.6 to the already existing symbolic link libunity.so.9, so whenever someone tries to access libunity.so.6, it will automatically redirect it to libunity.so.9.

Do I break anything if I\nsudo apt-get purge apport\n\nI have my secret business plan for world domination and who knows what's in a core dump? \nI've seen Ubuntu (in particular dconf) recreate config settings. I know how to disable it but can't trust it to remain disabled. Hence my question.\nYea Yea I know know my different distro ... but I'd like to use Ubuntu if I can.\n\nA: It is probably safe to remove Apport, but doing so is completely unnecessary for protecting your privacy.\nApport's core dump interception is disabled by default on stable versions of Ubuntu. To completely disable Apport, edit /etc/default/apport. Change enabled=1 to enabled=0. (1 means it's enabled. 0 means it's disabled.) Then reboot (or manually stop the service) to apply the change. See the Apport documentation, and especially the section on current versions of Ubuntu, for more details.\nApport does not use gconf or dconf for setting whether or not it is enabled. It is a system service, and whether or not it runs (i.e., whether or not it intercepts crashes, creates crash dumps, and makes it possible for the user to submit them to Launchpad or other web services) is not determined by any user's per-user settings.\nIf you do remove Apport, you will lose the ability to use it to report non-crash bugs (with Help > Report a Bug) or running ubuntu-bug. If then you or another administrator decides to reinstall it for this purpose, then depending on how you removed it and what system you are running when you reinstall it, it might then become enabled for intercepting crashes and creating/submitting core dumps.\nSo if you're vigilant (or even if you're not), disabling Apport should be quite sufficient. If you're not vigilant, then uninstalling Apport might actually make it more likely to intercept and submit crash data in the future (as described above), if you reinstall it for its other functionality and forget to check if the crash reporting service is enabled.\nIf you do decide to remove Apport, you can check first to see if doing so would break everything, by simulating its removal:\napt-get -s remove apport\n\nThat will show you what other packages would be removed as a consequence. Then, to actually remove it:\nsudo apt-get remove apport\n\nPlease note that you probably do not want to purge it, since if you remove it you'll want to keep the apport configuration file in /etc/default that has enabled=0. (Just know that this doesn't necessarily guarantee that the crash reporting service will never be enabled upon reinstallation, in any future version.)\n\nA: Yes, you can remove apport but unless you actually agree(d) on apport sending information it will never send any data. \nEven better: The automatic crash interception component of apport is disabled by default in stable releases for a number of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as core dumps, stack traces, and log files. They can contain passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers, and other private material.\nThis is mitigated by the fact that it presents you what will be sent to the bug tracker, and that all crash report bugs are private by default, limited to the Ubuntu bug triaging team. We can reasonably expect developers and technically savvy users, who run the development release, to be aware of this and judge whether it is appropriate to file a crash report. But we shouldn't assume that every Ubuntu user of stable releases is able to do so.\n\n*During the development release we already collect thousands of crash reports, much more than we can ever fix. Continuing to collect those for stable releases is not really useful, since\n\n\n*\n\n*The most important crashes have already been discovered in the development release.\n\n*The less important ones are not suitable for getting fixed in stable releases (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\n\n*Asking users to send crash reports to us is insincere, since we can't possibly answer and deal with all of them.\n\n\n*Data collection from apport takes a nontrivial amount of CPU and I/O resources, which slow down the computer and don't allow you to restart the crashed program for several seconds.\n\nIf apport is currently active you can disable it by editing...\nsudo nano /etc/default/apport\n\nand follow the comments:\n\n# set this to 0 to disable apport, or to 1 to enable it\n# you can temporarily override this with\n# sudo service apport start force_start=1\nenabled=1\n\nSet it to 0.\n", "Q: Wireless won't associate after 12.04 upgrade I have a problem connecting to my wireless when I upgraded to 12.04 from 10.04.

Works fine with WPA AES.\nIs this a driver problem or something in nm? I've seen similar reports with other drivers.\nWhen this occurs, nm seems to report that I am connected for 30 sec (though there is no connection) so this may relate to other bug reports.\n\nA: This is actually a comment rather than an answer to your question. I didn't think I'd have enough room in a comment so I used the answer format.\nYou don't explain in your question why you want to be able to use WPA TKIP. Frankly, if AES will work it is probably a better choice than TKIP, especially if you are using 802.11n (and your  Atheros 9285 follows the 802.11n spec). \nThe 802.11n spec states that the high throughput rates (link rates above 54 Mbps) can not be enabled unless you either (1) use no security  or (2) use WPA2 AES.\nRef: 5 Ways To Fix Slow 802.11n Speed\nI am not trying to tell you to ignore the problem you are asking about. I just wanted to suggest that if you can use WPA2 AES that is probably what you to do.\n", "Q: Can I disable Chromium's in-browser mp3 player? When I click on a link in Chromium to an mp3, can I make the default behavior be to download it and not to start playing it with some in-browser thing?\nI've disabled all of my plugins, so it's not one of them trying to play the file.  And I suppose I could always right-click or control-click or what have you -- but the problem isn't that I don't know how to download the file (if I were desperate and/or crazy I would just curl it), the problem is that Chromium seems to think that one of its roles is to play mp3s for me.  I just want to set it straight.\nChromium Version:  18.0.1025.168 (Developer Build 134367 Linux) Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: This option does not exist, and from what I gather it is intentionally left out and will not be added.\nYou can alt-click any link to store the file directly, disregarding its type (mp3, avi, pdf, html, ...).\nIt was of course not confirmed, but supposedly, this is done to keep the user inside the browser and extend the browsers control of the user. Reading the EULA supports this.\n\nA: You should be able to, but I think its a bug.  If you type about:plugins in the address bar, and disabled the mp3 plugin it will not work.  I have tried it.  You can try it yourself and see.  In the mean time a workaround is to right-click the file and choose save link as, and that will do it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Live CD won't Boot I run the installer and when it hits the nouveau video section I see it flash and try to load the desktop, but drops back to a cursor.\nIt appears that the nouveau drivers are failing with my Geforce GTX 550ti\nDoes anyone know if there is a work around to install Ubuntu?\n\nA: I had a bunch of problems with installing Ubuntu on this graphics card.\nI finally managed to do it, but it took a roundabout solution to finally get it up and running (just managed to do so today). I was unable to get my 11.10 CD or my 12.04.1 CD to boot. What I ended up doing was installing 11.04 and upgrading it to 12.04.1. I ran into a few problems along the way. Since I have a dual boot with Windows 7, when I installed 11.04 it messed up grub. No big deal, I just popped in my 11.04 CD and re-installed grub.\nThen I upgraded to 12.04.1. After this install Grub was messed up again, so I popped in my 12.10 CD (which for some reason boots, but the graphics drivers wont work on it) and again reinstalled grub. After I rebooted and chose Ubuntu in grub, I got a purple screen that would flash black. Again, this posed no trouble, I just restarted, entered recovery mode, enabled networking, opened the root prompt and ran sudo apt-get install nvidia-current.\nHope this helps you, it took a lot of trial and error to get to this point.\n\nA: Okay, I had the same problem recently, I've browsed every forum and did extensive research on the issue with no solutions, after fooling around, me and a friend figured it out! As soon as you install Linux, go into the bios. Under the bios you will have the option of the hard drive running in achi mode or IDE mode, make sure it's on IDE mode and it should boot fine afterwords.\n\nA: Nouveau has had serious issues with Nvidia GTX 5X series graphics from the start. There isn't an easy workaround. You basically need a liveUSB or CD with the proprietary Nvidia drivers installed. I managed to create a liveUSB system and boot from a computer with a  Nvidia video card and then installed the Nvidia drivers. After that you can use Remastersys to create a live CD with Nvidia drivers. \nIf anyone expresses interest in hosting a torrent file, I have the 12.04 amd64 live CD with Nvidia drivers already installed.   \n", "Q: Problem when attempting to put Ubuntu One in panel (12.04) I wanted to put the Ubuntu One icon in the panel so I could see the progress of my sync but when I try this is what I get....\nmohd-arafat-hossain@TUD:~$ sudo apt-get install ubuntuone-indicator\n[sudo] password for mohd-arafat-hossain: \nReading package lists...

If my memory serves me correctly, in the early '90s on a Mac (but not on any MS O/S), one could print a hardcopy as an ordered list of a folders contents.\nIt occured to me that this is still a helpful thing for quickly printing out for condensed list where one hs many items such as docs, pics, music etc in a structured list. Does anyone know if this is possible on Ubuntu's Unity/frontend or if there is a small app in software centre. For now I cannot find one and for certain work would be a great 'time saver' instead of jotting down on paper with a pen. Any directions much appreciated.\n\nA: One quick way to do what you are suggesting is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up nautilus (the ordinary file browser)\n\n*Navigate to the folder whose content file names you want to print\n\n*Select everything (Ctrl-a) or Edit->Select all.\n\n*Copy it to the clipboards with (Ctrl-c) or Edit->Copy\n\n*Open Gedit (the default text editing software)\n\n*Paste (Ctrl-v) or Edit->Paste\n\n*Print the text with gedit's print function\n\n\nThe only downside to this is that it will be absolute paths, but you should be able to do some search and replace to get rid of the prefix.\nAs always, there is probably a command line way to do it much easier, something like piping ls into lp. If you need this solution as well and cannot figure out the commands, let me know and I'll look into it.\nRegards TLE\n\nA: A simple way to print a directory content list would be using command line tools:\nls | lpr <Printer>\n\nThis will pipe the output of ls (or any other command that generates an output) to the line printer , if installed. To find the name of attached printers run\nlpstat -p -d\n\nFor a long list that may need formatting however I recommend to redirect the output of ls to a file.\nFor a right click solution we simply put a script to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/ with e.g. the following content (to open the current directory file list in Gedit):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nls | gedit\n\nOr we define a nautilus action to do so.\n\nA: I would recommend the tree command.  It is recursive and you can redirect the output to a text file, then print the text file.\n\nA: Use find command.\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -print | sort | lpr \n\nGUI approach would be with a simple script that is linked to a keyboard shortcut, say Ctrl + Alt + K.

Again, the line originated in some tutorial or guide to installing Java on Ubuntu.\n\n*I than went on to install the Java version 6 JRE using \"sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-plugin\". This worked and made me happy (as a latter \"java -version\" showed that Java was installed) - finally, the correct command was found!\n\n*Than I unpacked the file \"eclipse-cpp-indigo-SR2-incubation-linux-gtk.tar.gz\" into my /usr/Apps folder, and than moved it to the /opt/ folder (I don't remember where it's located).\n\n*Finally, I installed g++ using the command \"apt-get install g++\". Things looked good.\nI than created a simple HelloWorld program - I created a source file named \"try1.cpp\" and wrote in this code:\n#include <cstdio>\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\nprintf(\"Hello World1!/n\");\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nWhen I build the project using right click on the project and ->'Build Project', I get the following input:\n**** Build of configuration Debug for project OS.Ex4 ****\n\nmake all \nBuilding file: ../try1.cpp\nInvoking: GCC C++ Compiler\ng++ -O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -MMD -MP -MF\"try1.d\" -MT\"try1.d\" -o \"try1.o\" \"../try1.cpp\"\nFinished building: ../try1.cpp\n\nBuilding target: OS.Ex4\nInvoking: GCC C++ Linker\ng++  -o \"OS.Ex4\"  ./try1.o   \nFinished building target: OS.Ex4\n\n**** Build Finished ****\n\nI can see that the try.o object is created in the 'debug' folder of the project, and I can also see that no binary file is created - both by the build log and the lack of it in the 'debug' folder.\nThat is why it is not surprising that when I try to run my project I get the next error message: \"Launch failed. Binary not found.\"\nSo, what am I doing wrong? I have the g++ compiler, and it's compiling the code into object files correctly, so why no linking into a binary file is done? I have an intact main function...\nI'll appreciate your help with solving this problem.\nThanks,\nShay\n\nA: As cqcallaw recommended in his second comment, installing using sudo apt-get install eclipse instead of manually downloading and unpacking the compressed package, solved the weird behaviour eclipse exhibited.\n\nA: *\n\n*apt-get update does not install things, it only updates your package index\n\n*g++  -o \"OS.Ex4\"  ./try1.o.  Look in your build folder for the file OS.Ext4.  To run this in eclipse, you need to set your run configuration to run this file.\n\n*You should probably be using the official openjdk for java.\n\n*The eclipse website does not host \"installers\".  You just download and unpack the archive and run it from that directory.\n\n*Verify that your linker is working correctly by running make manually and doing the g++ job yourself.\n\n\nA: I see that your problem is solved, but there's another solution if others stumble upon this answer:\nDon't use dots in project name; instead of OS.Ex4, use OS_Ex4 or similar. Eclipse seems to have problems with dots in project name.\n", "Q: What is the safe way to run apache I installed apache according to the description given here. I want to know what is the safe way to run Apache that means , it is impossible to run Apache without using sudo, I want to know whether this is safe or is there a accepted way of running Apache.\n\nA: If you're not certain about security considerations when running Apache, you probably don't want to install Apache from source. I'd recommend installing Apache with sudo apt-get install apache2 or through the Software Center. \nInstalling Apache with aptitude will automatically register Apache as a system service, which solves the problem of running Apache in a reasonably secure way, as long as your system configuration isn't highly customized.\n", "Q: 12.04 taking very long time while installing on VMware workstation 7.1.1 I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 desktop edition using VMware workstation 7.1.1.

To the first i used the command\nmogrify -extract 500x500+224+202 '/home/ashhab/Desktop/Abstract_Wallpaper (copy).jpg'\n\nThen i get this\n\nFor the second I used this command\nmogrify -extract 500x500 '/home/ashhab/Desktop/Abstract_Wallpaper (another copy).jpg'\n\nand i get this\n\nThe command can be explained as\nmogrify -extract (size)(offset) [file path]\n\nSo my question is what does the offset(+224+202) actually do? what does offset mean?\n\nA: The offset means the location where it should start extracting the image. So an offset of +224+202 means go 224 to the right and 202 to the bottom and from that point take out the 500x500 pixels you want (In this case it will be pixels but it can also be a percentage). \n\nFrom your link If you omit the offsets, as in ... the image is resized to the specified dimensions instead. So the 3rd one is a 500x500 version of the original and it is zoomed but zoomed out.\n", "Q: GUI program to shred or wipe files with options to make sure they are unrecoverable?

The last update I got was one the update manager then all I get is source update that seems to take forever..\n\nA: This was due to problems with some of the Canonical servers (for the Main & US repo's) starting on 05/15. It has been fixed sometime over the last several hr.s & speeds should be back to normal\n\nA: Well this might also be because the upgrade being new,the servers are loaded as many people are updating...So it takes longer than usual...\n\nA: Don't see how this is a question, because it's normal too see the repositories take time to update the system and then ubuntu runs some python and perl scripts and all too get the system you have.\n", "Q: Can't log in to ubuntu 12.04 I can't log in to my ubuntu 12.04. Once I login I got returned back to the original screen after a trial to enable X11 Forwarding.\nCan you help me with this.\n\nA: I haven't tried to enable X11Forwarding, but I used to have the same problem. You can fix this in a few steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you get to the graphical login screen, hit Ctrl+Alt+F2, thus you get to a textual login.\n\n*Put in your name and password (password is not displayed when you type, neither as stars or bullets).\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install gdm and hit enter, give your password and wait to get a line ending with a dollar sign again.\n\n*Type sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm.\n\n*Hit Enter at the first screen.\n\n*Select gdm in the list you get in the second screen with the arrow keys.\n\n*Hit the Tab button (above the caps lock one). Now you see the word Ok highlighted. Hit Enter.\n\n*Type sudo reboot and hit enter. You'll get another graphical login screen, but you'll be able to log in!\n\n\nP.S.: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you are used to running some programs like ifconfig or others which are administrative ones from a terminal emulator (e.g. gnome-terminal) you'd better add a line like PATH=\"$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin\" at the end of the .bashrc file in your home directory. You can do it with echo 'PATH=\"$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin\"' >> ~/.bashrc.\n\n*If you want to change back to the other graphical login screen from time to time and see if it was bug-fixed and it works again you can run sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm and select lightdm and reboot (doesn't look like it works if you just run sudo pkill X).\n\nA: I encountered the same issue after installing package vnc4server in Ubuntu 12.10.  (Maybe it sets up X11 forwarding, not sure.)  I found that in my home directory, files .Xauthority, .bash_history and folder .vnc were all owned by user root and group root.  Changing them (and all files underneath .vnc) to be owned by my own user with the chown command allowed me to login (I rebooted first).\nTo make these corrections, either ssh into the box from elsewhere or switch to text console with Ctrl+Alt+F2.\n\nA: I found out my problem was related to a messy package repository. I updated my repositories and reinstalled ubuntu-desktop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to bash, (Ctrl+Alt+F1)\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nSolved.\n\nA: This can happen if there is an error in your .bashrc or .profile file.  From the graphical login screen hit Ctrl+Alt+F2 and login from there.  Fix any errors that you see printed to the console.  Type: sudo reboot\n\nA: Had the same problem when I accidentally used:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nI found that it had removed ubuntu-desktop for some reason. You can try Ctrl+Alt+F1 and use the following command:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nAfter it has finished, press Ctrl+Alt+F7 and login as usual. Mine was still lacking the Restart and User accounts buttons on the panel; for that, go to terminal and use:\nunity --reset\n\nSolved my problem. \n\nA: Check your .xsession-errors file in the home dir for any errors after logging in via CTRL+ALT+F1\nIn my case, .xsession-errors showed an error saying I had bad characters in my .profile file from my git installation(human error.. my bad)\nAfter I fixed the error in my .profile file, I was able to login via the login GUI\nComment #18 at the below link helped me.\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+question/197479\n\nA: My problem was that somehow due to manipulations with SSD, permissions of /tmp were messed up and I found on some Ubuntu forum this solution which helped me:\nchmod 777 /tmp\nchmod +t /tmp\nsudo chown root:root /tmp\n\n\nA: It has happened to me a couple of times and each time I restarted the Display Manager and could log in. \nDrop to tty1 with Ctrl-Alt-F1.\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nA: Log in to bash, (Ctrl+Alt+F1)\n$passwd\n$newpasswd\n$newpasswd\n\nYou are good to go now!\nthat's what solved my issue.\n", "Q: Unable to boot Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu to MacBook with OS X & Windows 7 (bootcamp) I had Lion OSX partitioned with Windows 7 using BootCamp [on my MacBook]. \nI downloaded and installed Ubuntu last night and it went well. Until this morning when I tried to boot up Windows 7 and it took me to Ubuntu instead. \nI saw the windows 7 loader so I clicked on that. It brought me to a black screen with a white cursor in the top left. This is what windows usually looks like when it boots but this time it just stayed on the black screen. \nI also tried holding option and choosing the windows drive manually but it brought me back to Ubuntu. I think what happened was that I did not click on the Windows 7 loader when installing Ubuntu 12.04 last night. \nWhat can I do to fix this? \n\nA: It would help to have more detailed information about how your GRUB and Windows boot configuration are currently setup on your MacBook. I suggest you try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the Ubuntu you installed on your MacBook.\n\n*Create a Bootinfo Summary using the boot_info_script. \n\n*Copy the summary into a pastebin (For example, http://paste.ubuntu.com).\n\n*Edit your question to include the link to the pastebin containing the summary.\n\n\nAn alternative way to accomplish the same thing would be to install and run a utility named Boot-Repair tool. It will create a bootinfo summary and post it to a pastebin for you \"automatically\" in one step.\nI have another answer which describes how to do this. Here is a link to that answer:\nHow to use boot-repair to provide a \"Bootinfo Summary\" \n\n\n*\n\n*Note:\nThe Boot-Repair tool also has a button to perform a Recommended repair. Since this is a Mac with a hybrid MBR, I would caution against doing that until you have a better understanding of just what the problem is.\nMy advice is to first get the bootinfo summary and wait until you have looked at it before attempting to fix this with Boot-Repair.\n", "Q: Managing iPod playlists? OK, I know very similar questions have been asked before.  But I have searched for the last week, and cannot figure out how to manage iPod playlists on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit.\nAll the \"usual suspects\" (Rhythmbox, Banshee, Amarok, etc.) are completely unable to edit/create/delete iPod playlists correctly.  The only program I've ever had any success with was gtkpod, which is unusable on 12.04 64-bit.\nSo what options do I have? I have a 4th generation video iPod (sort of old).  The default music player, Rhythmbox, seems to put playlists on the iPod, but all it does is append.  So adding one file to a playlist causes Rhythmbox to double every other file in the playlist!\nIs it truly impossible to use both Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit and have a manageable iPod?\nThanks!\n\nA: While finding how to use iPhone 3G as a Wi-Fi source under 12.04 64-bit, I found that the latest version of libimobiledevice gives support for several of Apple devices. \nNow I can edit my songs for my iPod, shuffle 4G via Rhythmbox, and also I can tether Wi-Fi via my iPhone 3GS 32GB under iOS 5.1.1. \nAs an advice, visit the project website and read some documentation and give it a try. \nI warn you, this is not the same as iTunes, remember this is open source and one of the main aims of Apple it's totally the opposite. You are going to be able to manage your music, podcasts, videos, etc. but advance settings like playlist editing, advance sync and settings maybe will be unavailable for now. \nGood luck.\n\nA: Even I was facing the same problem Rhythmbox, but i tried and saw that gtkpod version 2.1.1 is working perfectly fine for my playlists on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise 64-bit.

I have tried to change the terminal preferences, without success. any ideas?\n\nA: Geany uses GTK+ 2.0 so you need libvte9\nsudo apt-get install libvte9\n\n\nA: This is because Ubuntu12 lacks libvte.so, or at least the version Geany uses to emulate the terminal. Try this command\nsudo apt-get install libvte-dev\n\n\nA: You can only install to enable the terminal tab: libvte9\n\nA: Did You try to enable Menu-> View -> Show Message Window ?

I don't think there's a need for a special driver for it, as the rPAC works fine on Windows/Mac OS X using the generic USB driver.\nWhen I plug it in, I find the following in syslog:\nMay 19 19:31:11 UBUNTUBOX kernel: [  179.096403] usb 1-1.2: new full-speed USB device number 5 using ehci_hcd\nMay 19 19:31:14 UBUNTUBOX pulseaudio[1678]: [pulseaudio] alsa-util.c: Unable to load mixer: Invalid argument\nMay 19 19:31:14 UBUNTUBOX kernel: [  182.207155] 5:1:1: usb_set_interface failed\n\nThere are loads of those usb_set_interface failed lines.

But firstly, I get the following error:\ncannot find the slot for index 1 (range 0-29), error: -16\n\nand secondly, the rPAC light remains at red.  So I've backed out my changes to alsa.conf.\nIf anyone's got any bright ideas, I'd very much appreciate it!

To playback music I use MPD and GMPC with bit perfect configuration, i.e. in the mpd.conf file I have\naudio_output {\n    type        \"alsa\"\n    name        \"ARCAM USB Audio 1.0\"\n    device      \"hw:1,0\"    # optional\n}\n\nwhen trying to play a song, GMPC tells it cannot open the playback device or something similar. I also got the \"usb_set_interface failed\" errors in syslog (running dmesg). After various online searches, trials and errors, I finally decided to uninstall completely PulseAudio. After rebooting, everything is working now (red light while not playing, green light while playing, as in Win7... and great sound!).\nI made further checks while playing 96kHz FLAC running the following command\ncat /proc/asound/card1/stream0\n\nARCAM ARCAM USB Audio 1.0 at usb-0000:00:1d.0-1, full speed : USB Audio\n\nPlayback:\n  Status: Running\n    Interface = 1\n    Altset = 1\n    URBs = 3 [ 8 8 8 ]\n    Packet Size = 582\n    Momentary freq = 96000 Hz (0x60.0000)\n    Feedback Format = 10.14\n  Interface 1\n    Altset 1\n    Format: S24_3LE\n    Channels: 2\n    Endpoint: 1 OUT (ASYNC)\n    Rates: 44100, 48000, 88200, 96000\n\nIt seems everything is working well since the momentary freq is 96kHz as expected and the format (S24_3LE) says the information is passed directly to the DAC (as I understood from my online searches).\nHope it helps!\nCheers,\nGael\n\nA: I've been through all the same things as you have, and also have had no luck.\nI contacted the place from where I bought the rPAC, who then contacted Arcam, who stated that the device isn't supported on Linux (the documentation, you may note states that it works on 'PCs'...). Undeterred, I asked Arcam directly on Twitter (they didn't bother to respond to an email that I sent on the 4th May, which was nice of them), who contradicted their support people, and said that it does work (on Linux), and the person responding thought that they were running Fedora; I tried that too, to no avail.\nYou could always ask them (Twitter/email) and see how they respond. I'd certainly be interested to see.\nEDIT: Perhaps ask them to comment on this question?\nCheers\nJames\n\nA: It's an old post but I am sure there are people liek me that will benefit from my findings on the rPac and Linux. \nIt looks like the rPac starts as a usd 1.0 device by default. Some kernels accept that but most of them don't. \nTo force the rPac starting as a usb 2.0 device press both volume buttons while powering it up. You'll get the amber LED which also means the device is on mute. Then, press one of the volume buttons. At this point, you should be ready to play music through your rPac.\nYou'll see the following in usb 1.0 \ncat /proc/asound/card1/stream0\n\nARCAM ARCAM USB Audio 1.0 at usb-0000:00:1d.0-1, full speed : USB Audio\n\nBut in usb 2.0 mode you'll see the following\ncat /proc/asound/card1/stream0\n\nARCAM ARCAM USB Audio 2.0 at usb-0000:00:1d.0-1, full speed : USB Audio\n\nNote the 2.0... and the sound card name will change to from A10 to A20\nI tested the procedure on Ubuntu 13.10 and debian 7 and it works.\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: How can I install Rhythmbox in xubuntu without nautilus?

As for nautilus, it may be used for some functions of Rhythmbox (probably file management related); it's not going to replace Thunar as your default file manager, although if you ever want to run Nautilus for some reason, you could probably do so.\n\nMeta-discussion on apt-get and installing recommends by default\napt-get on Ubuntu is set to install recommended packages by default. This behavior appears to be inherited from Debian 5 (Lenny) onwards -- it's the same in Ubuntu Lucid; before Debian Lenny, it was disabled. Some developers will abuse or mindlessly set recommends when it may not be needed, but it's probably the default for a reason.\nYou can check it's status by running:\nsudo apt-config dump | grep Recommends\nand if it returns APT::Install-Recommends \"1\"; (or true), yours is set up to install recommends.\nYou can change this graphically by installing Synaptic, going to Edit...Preferences and unchecking \"Consider recommended packages as dependencies.\" But if you've read this far, it's easier to just put APT::Install-Recommends \"0\"; in /etc/apt/apt.conf ;)\nThe best option is to do it on a case-by-case basis as @fossfreedom's answer suggests.\n", "Q: How can I programmatically get the PID of the active GNOME Terminal instance? How can I get the PID of the GNOME Terminal instance I'm using from within a Bash script?\nI can run xprop _NET_WM_PID and then manually click the terminal window, but I'd like to completely automate this.\n\nA: I've written  two recursive functions that trace parents of a process\nget_parent()\n{\n ps --no-headers -p $1 -o ppid,cmd \n}\n\nprocess_list()\n{\n  if [ \"$1\" -ne \"1\"  ]; then\n   PARENT=\"$(get_parent $1 )\"\n   printf \"%s\\n\" \"$PARENT\"\n   process_list $( printf \"%s\" \"$PARENT\" | awk '{print $1}'  )\n  fi \n}\n\nprint_header()\n{\n  printf \"PPID\\tPROCESS\\n\"\n  for i in $(seq 1 20 ) \n  do\n     printf \"-\"\n  done\n  printf \"\\n\"\n}\nprint_header\nprocess_list $$\n\nWhat I've found in the process is this:\n$ bash get_process_list                                                        \nPPID    PROCESS\n--------------------\n31264 bash get_process_list\n31251 mksh\n16696 gnome-terminal\n15565 /bin/mksh\n 2164 x-terminal-emulator\n 1677 init --user\n 1342 lightdm --session-child 12 19\n    1 lightdm\n\nSo we could use the two functions and grep the gnome-terminal, assuming that's what the user wants. If the user wants any terminal emulator, that may be problematic because aside from checking lsof for a pts device open, there's no way to tell whether or not the process is a terminal emulator. \nAside from that , there is something very interesting as well:\n$ bash get_process_list                                                                    \nPPID    PROCESS\n--------------------\n32360 bash get_process_list\n23728 -mksh\n 2164 tmux\n 1677 init --user\n 1342 lightdm --session-child 12 19\n    1 lightdm\n\ntmux apparently forks itself and the process gets picked up by init , so again there's the obstacle.\nUsing Unity's Ayatana\nThe code bellow uses qdbus and Ayatana's dbus interface to list all gnome-terminal windows and whether they are focused at the moment or not.

The result is a small resolution (1024*768) that does not look good (fuzzy) and I cannot watch YouTube videos (the video box keeps on moving to the right and back) and the same flickering effect happens with droping menus and Google's suggestion box.\nI've tried multiple solutions sugested in posts with no good result (including installing the drivers downloaded from the Nvidia page). \nAs far as I can guess, the problem is that the NVIDIA card is present but not recognized and thus the drivers do not work. Originally the drivers were installed (nvidia-current and the rest, all updated), but could not configure them with nvidia-config (says driver not present) and they did not show up with jockey-gtk. There's also been an error message about GLX not being present either. SCREENSHOT\nFor the HDMI the monitor says that there's no signal of MHL is not installed.\nThe computer is running now with no Nvidia drivers and no xorg.conf file (it gives me the best resolution).

It's called \"Nvidia Hybrid Graphics\" and it's a nightmare under Linux.\nYour only solution is to disable one of the GPU and then install the correct driver for the other one. If you disable the nVidia GPU (my suggestion), you will have better battery life and it will work out-of-the-box but you will get worse 3D performance in games and WebGL. If you disable the Intel GPU, you'll need to install the nVidia proprietary drivers (they don't use XrandR and they need a proper Xorg.conf file).\nTo switch to a single GPU, you have 2 options:\n1) Select the GPU in the HP BIOS, if there is such an option. Maybe upgrade to the latest BIOS first to be sure.\n2) If there is no such option, follow these instructions on the Ubuntu wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: I've found a solution writing a script that adapts the resolution each time I login. \nTo make my life easier I had swapped monitors with the one I hook to my other laptop at my coworking space (that one detects the new monitor in both VGA and HDMI). \nFirst I searched for my monitor's specifications using Google to figure out the optimal resolution, using these keywords: syncmaster t220 specs. This is the first bit of information I needed: Native Resolution 1680 x 1050 at 60 Hz.\nThen I opened a terminal and used cvt to get the correct mode to add: \ncvt 1680 1050\n\nThis is the result: \n# 1680x1050 59.95 Hz (CVT 1.76MA) hsync: 65.29 kHz; pclk: 146.25 MHz\nModeline \"1680x1050_60.00\"  146.25  1680 1784 1960 2240  1050 1053 1059 1089 -hsync +vsync\n\nThe part that maters comes right after Modeline. To copy in the terminal you highlight the text that matters with your mouse and then press Ctrl+Shift+c, and to paste Ctrl+Shift+v. You can open a couple terminals if you feel more comfortable. \nThen I used the simple text editor nano (you can also use gedit or any other simple text editor) and added the following: \n#!/bin/bash\nxrandr --newmode \"1680x1050_60.00\"  146.25  1680 1784 1960 2240  1050 1053 1059 1089 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1680x1050_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1680x1050_60.00\n\nAs you can see I directly pasted the result of cvt after xrandr --newmode to create the new mode I want to use. Then I use the content within the brackets into the next two lines. \nNotice that I used VGA1 for the output, but you can also use HDMI or whatever else you have connected. To find out the names of the devices just run xrandr without any parameters.  In my case, the laptop's screen is called LVDS1.\nThen I saved the file and exited (the commands are in the bottom of nano's screen, the ^ symbol means to use the Ctrl key in combination with whatever comes after it.) The name of the file does not matter, just make it something that will help you identify it later on (like, months after when you don't remember how you fixed your problem.)\nAfter that I changed the permissions of the file so that it could be executed: \nchmod +x activate-resolution-t220\n\nYou can also add execute permission using the file browser, right-clicking on it, selecting properties, the Permissions tab and then marking the tick box to the left of Allow executing file as program.\nRunning the file will change your monitor resolution: \n./activate-resolution-t220 \n\nUsually if you start typing the ./ and the beginning of the name of your file and hit the Tab key, the name of your file will be automatically written for you. If it is only part of it, then there's another file that shares that part as the beginning of their name and you have to add some more characters to help the computer see the one you mean and hit Tab again.\nTo execute it automatically every time I log in I just opened Startup Applications (in the Dash start typing startup and the icon will show right away), clicked on Add, clicked on Browse, looked for my file, clicked Open, and finally clicked Add. \nNow every time I log in, my monitor displays the right resolution :) \nIf you like this answer and find it useful, please vote it up! \n\nA: You might need to set the perms on the file first. See for ex. \nHow do I turn off the Radeon GPU on my HP Pavilion DM4?\n\nA: Found a temporary solution here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1364460 The problem is that I cannot make it permanent. From step #6 it talks about edition sudo gedit /etc/gdm/Init/Default but the file is no longer in use in Unity with lightdm. Do you guys know where I should make the changes to make it permanent? \nEdit I think the solution to make it permanent may be here How to force Multiple Monitors correct resolutions for LightDM?.\n", "Q: How do I remove all metadata from a quicktime movie file? My camera takes .mov files as movies.  How can I remove all metadata from them so I can feel confident sharing them on youtube without accidentally sharing when/where they were filmed, what type of camera I have, etc.  A command line one-liner is nice, but if it's too confusing, a GUI program would be better.\n\nA: NOTE: with a recent version of ffmpeg (and presumably avconv, but I haven't tested that), you can simply use:\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0 -map_metadata -1 -c copy output.mp4\n\nUsing -map_metadata -1 creates an empty 'dummy' metadata source. For the version of avconv in the repos, or other outdated versions, use the method described below.\n\nUsing avconv (or ffmpeg if that's your weapon of choice, the syntax is the same):\nThe easiest way to do this is to set -map_metadata to use one of the input streams, rather than using global metadata. 99% of the time this should work.\navconv -i input.mp4 -map 0 -map_metadata 0:s:0 -c copy output.mp4\n\nThis will take the metadata from the first data stream (normally the video stream) and use that to replace the global metadata of the container file. This works because most of the time, the data streams have no meaningful metadata written to them; however, sometimes they do, and you want to completely get rid of that metadata. Unfortunately, the only way I can think of to do this used a pipe and two avconv processes.\navconv -i input.mp4 -f wav - | avconv -i - -i input.mp4 -map 1 -map_metadata 0 -c copy output.mp4\n\nThis takes advantage of the fact that WAV files can't contain metadata (since the format was created before metadata tags existed).\nBoth of these methods blanked all metadata on a file I just tested them on - all that exiftool reported on was the codec information, and avprobe reported no metadata to me. Using a pipe for this is pretty ugly, and the first method will work in 99% of cases, so that should be preferred.\nBONUS: to create a blanked version of every MP4 in a directory, and then replace the metadata versions with the blanked versions (warning - pretty much irreversible):\nfor f in *.mp4; do avconv -i \"$f\" -map 0 -map_metadata 0:s:0 -c copy \"out.$f\"; mv \"out.$f\" \"$f\"; done\n\n\nA: Well, I have a command-line answer:\nNote: This only works with the ffmpeg included in Ubuntu by default: it will have a version similar to 0.8.1-4:0.8.1-0ubuntu1; it WILL NOT work with any ffmpeg binaries you have installed from a third-party PPA or compiled yourself. Your mileage may vary.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install these: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libimage-exiftool-perl\n\n*Then navigate to where your source .mov file is, we'll call it test.mov\n\n*And run:\n\nffmpeg -i test.mov -map_metadata -1 -vcodec copy -acodec copy test-nometadata.mov\n\n\n*You can then use exiftool to check that it worked; exiftool test.mov and exiftool test-nometadata.mov should show you the difference.\n\n*Here are my sample outputs from an old Nikon .mov with tons of metadata (pastebin'd):        \n\n\n*\n\n*before - 80 metadata lines\n\n*after - 52 metadata lines (even the create, modify etc.times have been nulled)\n\n\n\n\n(note that the order in ffmpeg above is essential -- the input and output files must be specified at the very end)\n", "Q: Can't use cut/copy/move/ on desktop I'm using 12.04.

You may want to grab the DVD image if your pen drive is big enough (the DVD image is ~1.5 GB and includes the GIMP). Then once you boot from USB, in the software center feel free to install all the apps you like, including your favorite games and codecs. You should be able to install them in the same way you installed them in Ubuntu running off your internal hard drive.\nCustomizing a live CD is not as easy, and I'd say less n00b friendly, but fortunately there's plenty of great documentation that can help n00bs do it.\n", "Q: How can I disable Ubuntu 12.04's E-mail thing? I use G-Mail. I don't need Ubuntu to boot up its own E-mail program, cramming up my boot times when I try to start my system?\nHow can I disable the E-mail program?\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop does not include any \"email program\" (client or server). Still, if you wish to save about 40-45 megabytes of space, you can remove it's default email client, Thunderbird, with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type sudo apt-get remove --purge thunderbird -y\n\n*Then type exit.\n\n\nA: If you want to remove the Messaging menu (looks like an email icon in the menu), there are several packages that need to be removed to do this (Thunderbird, Gwibber, Empathy and a few indicators). This is hard to accomplish from the command line, as there are some packages with a similar name that if removed, will also remove Ubuntu Desktop! So removing the Messaging menu is best accomplished using the Synaptic package manager. To install Synaptic, open a Terminal window (ctrl-alt-T), and enter at the command prompt:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\nTo open Synaptic after it is installed, enter at the command prompt:\nsudo synaptic\nThe first thing to do is remove Gwibber (a twitter/Facebook/etc client). In the quick filter box at the top of the Synaptic screen, type 'gwibber'. Wait a few seconds, and the list of packages is updated. Any items that have a green box in front of them, click on the green box and select 'Mark for Complete Removal'. After you have done this with all the green boxes, click on the Apply button.\nHandy tip: click on the S at the top of the column with the check boxes, and all the ones that are green will be sorted to the top.\nMake sure in the confirmation box that none of the packages to be removed are Ubuntu Desktop. You will want check for this whenever you remove a package.\nNext you want to remove Thunderbird (email app). In the quick filter box type 'thunderbird'. Do the same steps as before, click on any with a green box, and mark for complete removal. EXCEPT DO NOT REMOVE nautilus-sendto, as this will also remove Ubuntu Desktop. Click Apply and wait for it to process.\nNext remove Empathy by typing empathy in the quick filter box. Mark for complete removal all items with a green box EXCEPT DO NOT REMOVE adium-theme-ubuntu, which will also remove Ubuntu Desktop. Isn't this fun? Click Apply and wait for it to process.\nLast thing to do is remove the menu itself. In quick filter type 'indicator'. This time just a few items are to be removed. DO NOT check every item with a green box. Look for these four items and 'Mark for Removal' (DO NOT do complete removal, m'kay?)\nindicator-messages\nindicator-status-provider-mc5\nlibindicator-messages-status-provider1\ntelepathy-indicator\nClick Apply and wait for it process. That's it!

I have tried the following steps in order to try and make it work:\n\n*\n\n*Installed ndiswrapper versions 1.57 (from repositories, with dkms) and 1.58rc1 (compiled from source from ndiswrapper's website). Both failed: version 1.57 does not provide an interface for the functions IoWMIOpenBlock and IoWMIQueryAllData. 1.58rc1 has dummy functions in their places, but it fails with a \"ioremap failed\" message.\nUpon further investigation, I have found that the function NdisMMapIOSpace (ndis.c:808), in 1.58rc1, gets called with physical address and length zero, which causes the failure. Since this function doesn't seem to be called from anywhere in ndiswrapper's code, I'd assume the Windows driver is somehow calling it with bogus parameters.\n\n\n*I tried using both the 64-bit version (on my installed system, which uses the x86_64 version of Ubuntu) and the 32-bit version (on a live-USB x86 system with persistence enabled) of the Windows XP driver. The same errors occurred for both versions.\n\n\n*Since Realtek's Linux drivers for RTL8192CE/SE/DE actually mention the 8723 chipset in its sources, I tried compiling them and modprobing them, but they don't pick up the card ID (10ec:8723). I also tried to echo 10ec 8723 > new_id on the sysfs  (/sys/bus/pci/drivers/rtl8192de) location ( of the driver (actually, on each of them, one at a time), but I get a \"Permission denied\" error even with sudo. If I sudo su and try again, I get the error bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument.\nI have run out of ideas. It's really frustrating to buy a new notebook to use only with Ubuntu and not be able to use its wi-fi connection.\nIf anyone can shed a light on alternatives, I'd be very thankful.\nEdit: lshw -C network output\n$ sudo lshw -C network -numeric\n  *-network UNCLAIMED     \n       description: Network controller\n       product: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I have to use an external linksys adapter because my onboard realtek is gone  :/\n<<>>\nDisregard above comment because I was pissed when I wrote that.\nUPDATE: I found out that somehow that driver has set my WLAN module's 'Roaming Sensitivity' setting to 'Low', which was causing it to not be able to detect any wireless signal whatsoever. In Windows 7, I went to device manager and changed that setting to 'High' and voilá - it went back alive!\nphew...\nIn any case, be aware that this sort of thing might happen to you if you're not careful when following advice from the interwebs. I will think twice before booting into my ubuntu partition again...\n\nA: I talked with a support guy from Realtek and received the very same files hosted on Dropbox submitted by another user on this question. I compiled the drivers as the readme instructed and it worked, you might need to copy the 8723* firmware files into the rtlwifi folder.\nIt should be said however that this solution is not perfect, I have some pretty shaky connection to WEP APs. Also this driver support up to and including kernel 3.3.\nThe 3.4 kernel have removed some calls in the mac80211 module that this driver needs to compile and thus exits with an error and can not compile. This is not an issue for ubuntu right now, but it means you can't install the driver on a up-to-date Fedora 17 or any other distro using the 3.4+ kernel - including upcoming versions of Ubuntu.\nSee http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/84114/match=ieee80211_hw_beacon_filter for information about the changes.\n\nA: Realtek is making the official Linux driver available unofficially (via Dropbox)\nSupport for the RTL8273AE-BT has been added by Realtek in the 92-series driver, version 0006.0514.2012. For unknown reasons, neither the Windows nor Linux drivers are available on their website (yet). But Realtek tech support has been providing a Dropbox link with the source code/firmware tarball which numerous users have reported as working.\nWhere do I get it? Is it safe?\n\n\n*\n\n*The driver can be downloaded via this Dropbox link.\n\n*I can confirm that this file is what it claims to be, with this content listing, provided it has the following MD5 or SHA1 hashes: (which you can verify with md5sum or sha1sum)\n\nMD5: fd10e9a347c6447f649324d6bdab53de\nSHA1: 1ccd6ae73878d8bf65bd7c0384e333b121606230\n\nHow do I build and install the driver on Ubuntu?\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*You'll need to install these packages first to build the driver:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\n\n*Paste the below line to download and extract the driver archive in one single step:\nwget -O- http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57056576/DRIVERS/REALTEK/rtl_92ce_92se_92de_8723ae_linux_mac80211_0006.0514.2012.tar.gz | tar -xz\n\n\n*Change to the extracted driver's directory, build and install the driver:\n\ncd rtl_92ce_92se_92de_8723ae_linux_mac80211_0006.0514.2012\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n*Test the driver by loading it (this is a one-time step; after you reboot once, the driver should automatically load on every boot):\nsudo modprobe rtl8723e\n\n\nA: Well, I found a \"solution\". It's not a proper one: I just bought a wireless USB dongle (with the RTL8188CUS chipset) which, after installing the drivers, is promptly recognized.\nTo anyone browsing this thread with the same problem, I'd say the best solution is to wait for Realtek to release the official driver for 8723 on its website. They usually do that, and it's symptomatic that not even the Windows drivers are available on the official website (I guess this indicates this is a fairly new chipset).\nI'll keep an eye on the website, and when the driver is released, I'll update this answer with specific instructions for installation.\n\nA: please download this two files.

I had the same problem and downloading and building the two .gz files made my card work!\nFor some reason the install script didn't copy the firmware correctly, so I had to do it manually. I moved rtl8723fw.bin and rtl8723fw_B.bin from the rtlwifi folder in the source directory to /lib/firmware/rtlwifi/, rebooted and it worked. \nI'm sure it won't be long before the driver is added to the Linux kernel though.\n", "Q: Which word processor has best compatibility with the doc(x) formats?

I installed Ubuntu, but then installed Kubuntu over it (formated Ubuntu Partition) because Ubuntu is not compatible with almost any hardware on my PC.

What is the sanest way to do this?\n\nA: Because you have an 8GB flash drive, I'd recommend setting up a persistant live session, meaning when you boot your computer via USB you'll get an Ubuntu session that will retain your files and preferences (background image, theme, etc.). I've tried installing Ubuntu to a pendrive several times and it would normally crash beyond repair when running updates, yet running updates within a persistant live session seems to work well. On your Ubuntu box you should be able to access the Startup Disk Creator which will allow you to use an Ubuntu disc image and make your pendrive boot it. Ubuntu alone will take up less than a gig, you may want to grab the DVD edition which is 1.5 GB (includes GIMP so it's worth it), and you'll still have plenty of space for more software and files.\nAs for boot loaders, your pendrive will only boot Ubuntu, so not really an issue. Your non-Apple computers have a BIOS, where you have to make sure it's possible to boot from USB (Pentium 4's are a hit or miss, anything newer should be able to boot from USB). There are instructions here for booting Ubuntu via USB on a Mac. You may want to use UnetBootin on your Mac to make your pendrive bootable with Ubuntu.\nIf what you are looking for is like a portable virtual machine (which I doubt, because you said you want to modify files on your computer with USB running on a pendrive), it would be much more complicated for it to be OS-agnostic. Maybe using Qemu, but even then, you'd have to have it set up real well with emulators on the pen drive to be able to run a virtual machine on multiple computers/operating systems containing all the software to do that right on your pendrive.\n", "Q: How to start/stop downloads in Azureus (Vuze) via terminal? I need to stop/start download through shell script in Azureus(Vuze).\nI know there is CLI and I can invoke it as\njava -jar Azureus2-XXX.jar --ui=console\n\nThe ? will show a list of commands I can use. To get a list of torrents,\nshow torrents\n\netc. But it is CLI. I need shell script to do that so How I can use it to stop/start downloads through shell script?\nIs there any way to do that?\n\nA: This solution works flawlessly\nOK. So building up on my previous answer, here is a solution that works right out of the box without any hassle. \nFirst, install this plugin in Vuze: Azureus HTML WebUI \nNow, go to your browser and open http://localhost:6886/. This is a web UI for controlling your Vuze. Here, you can see that to pause/resume downloads, you have a link with such URL:\nhttp://localhost:6886/index.tmpl?act=pause\n\nNow, you can simply \"click\" this url using CURL by making a GET request. Hence, fire up these commands in the terminal for pausing and resuming: \ncurl --request GET 'http://localhost:6886/index.tmpl?act=pause'   # For pausing\ncurl --request GET 'http://localhost:6886/index.tmpl?act=resume'  # For resuming\n\n\nA: So far I found Flush which has command-line options which does my job but it has very less functionality compared to others.\nI use Flush to start or stop torrent downloads of running instance through terminal.\nI can use these options with flush.\n  --start={all,downloads,uploads}     Start torrents  \n  --stop={all,downloads,uploads}      Stop torrents\n\nnote: I didn't find anyway to do this in Vuze.\n\nA: It can be done in Vuze using a workaround. I haven't tried the solution but it should work. \nFirst, go here: http://plugins.vuze.com/plugin_list.php and look in the \"Remote Access\" section of Vuze plugins. There are a few plugins here which can help: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Vuze Web Remote\" should be good for our case. This plugin helps you control Vuze using web-based UI. Now, it also provides access to RPC methods (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:9091/vuze/rpc?json=%7B%22method%22%3A%22torrent-start-all%22%7D). \nSo, you can just ping this link using some Python script and it should work. You should be able to toggle your Vuze now. \n\n*\"Python Library\" provides API to control Vuze. You can use this API directly and write a Python script to control Vuze. \n\n\nA: I've never used vuze with Ubuntu, but in Windows you highlight the torrent and click stop/start.\nLike I said I have only used it with windows.\n", "Q: Print Driver is not working for HP4250n Since \"upgrading\" from Ubuntu version 11.10 to 12.4 on my T60, I can't get my HP 4250n laser printer to function.

Which programs installed by default in Ubuntu are generally regarded as safe to uninstall?\nI'm mostly thinking of things like social networking, E-mail, you know. Bonus stuff.\n\nA: You can uninstall anything you want. At work we even delete gdm and anything GUI related but that is because we have a command line fetish. \nOpen up Ubuntu Software Center and have a look at the list that shows installed.\n\nAnything in here, except for uncategorized and themes and tweaks since these might contain some software you do want to keep, should be safe for removal and should be standalone packages. This includes firefox, thunderbird, totem, libreoffice. The list goes on and on so you will not get a perfect answer to your question. \n\nA: If what you mean is \"safe to uninstall and still keep the default desktop functionality\" I think you need to be very careful about this, as it is entirely possible to do some real damage when you start uninstalling programs from the standard install.\nI am not as familiar with the software center, so I am not as sure that all the entries in there are safe to uninstall. If that is the case of course, then it is a commendable feature of the software center.\nWhat I would recommend (possibly in addition to some of the other recommendations) is to install the synaptic package manager as it gives you more direct information about what will happen. Search for the package that you want to uninstall. When you mark it for un-installation it will tell you which other programs will also be uninstalled. Have a close look at this list and make very sure that it only contains items related to the software you want to remove and make sure that it does not contain anything system related (e.g. stuff with gnome in the name and a bunch of other stuff). In general especially the last part can be difficult to determine, so be careful.\n\nA: I would have to say any program on the Ubuntu Software Center (USC) is safe to uninstall. Of course you must use your judgment as well.  If this is not what you are looking for, then please expand your question, explaining your idea of safe.\n\nA: Anything in the software center is safe to uninstall. but the synaptic is the better way to do it. just look through your menu for items you don’t want then type it in synaptic and remove.\nWattos is already very light I know this for sure but if you are trying to uninstall drivers for scanners printers etc. it can be a lot lighter. My wattos is under 1000 packages and it started at about 1800, but mine is very very minimal I had to be careful. \nMy suggestion is to keep a live CD handy to reinstall again if you mess up.\nLearning is the best part.\n", "Q: Edit GTK theme in Ubuntu How can I edit colors of current theme?\nI have bright theme with white windows but I can see black tooltips when I move mouse above Firefox' tabs, or Eclipse IDE.

Ubuntu does sometime group them when you are cycling through the open applications with Alt Tab. All you have to do then is to wait over the program that interest you without releasing the Tab key and all available windows will be made available for you to choose. Use the arrow keys then to select the want you want to see. \n\nA: You can fix it with\nunity --reset\nUnfortunately, you need to open a new terminal to do this.

In this example members of admin and sudo group can issue any command with sudo, but are prompted with a password ; members of the nopwd group are not prompted with a password.\nNote that the declaration order is relevant for users belonging to multiple groups. Unintuitively, the LAST matching group wins !\nIn order to require a password, you can add the PASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get command specification in file /etc/sudoers ; note that you probably want to allow specific commands with no password, and keep every other command with a password. An example explicitely requesting a password for apt-get:\n%users  ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot, PASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get\n\nNote that you can personnalize sudo with a much finer granularity than allow all commands like in my first example (doc ubuntu fr)(doc ubuntu en).\n", "Q: What is the difference between virtual terminals and Gnome terminals?

There are many more terminals of this kind available: xfce4-terminal, lxde-terminal, etc., with different looks, different feature sets, different dependencies and different \"weights\" (i.e. how much RAM they consume).\nThe \"virtual terminals\" (Ctrl+Alt+F1 to F6) are \"real\" terminals, not terminal emulators. If your regular desktop (Gnome) is ever in trouble, or you are having problems booting, you can try switching to another virtual terminal so that you can log in and try to fix the problem (in text mode).\nThis is a real terminal, as larsmans pointed out:\n\n", "Q: Display dims when not in use and it turns off when not in use or while watching movies I have Ubuntu 11.10 and am using it on dell xps laptop now my problem is that Ubuntu does not provide power utility form where I can manage brightness of my screen, when to turn it off, after how much time it should dim...etc etc. Please provide me with some advance power utility where I can manage it all.\nthanks in advance\n\nA: Click on the Dash Home button and type screen. and click on the Screen Control Panel that comes up.

I am going to be replacing ubuntu 11.10 with 12.04. Can I create a bootable MicroSD, or do I have to create the image on a CD?\n\nA: From the link in comment:\n\nWithin Ubuntu\nIf you're already using Ubuntu on a computer, you can already turn an Ubuntu ISO file into a bootable SD card. Simply click \"System,\" then \"Administration,\" then \"USB Startup Disk Creator.\" You'll be presented with a Windows asking for two things: the location of the ISO file and the disk you would like to overwrite. Note that this method completely overwrites a given SD card, so be sure to do this only with an empty card (or a full one with files you don't mind losing).\n\nSo if you still have the ISO you are set to go. Otherwise download it first.\nThe only difference with that link: now you open dash and search for USB or Startup disc creator.\n", "Q: How to recover a USB stick after Ubuntu installation?

How can I make it recognized and format it in order to use it again as a normal storage USB stick?\n\nA: here's some simple instructions just for your reference.\nA. First we need to delete the old partitions that remain on the USB key.\nOpen a terminal and type sudo su\nType fdisk -l and note your USB drive letter.\nType fdisk /dev/sdx (replacing x with your drive letter)\nType d to proceed to delete a partition\nType 1 to select the 1st partition and press enter\nType d to proceed to delete another partition (fdisk should automatically select the second partition)\n\nB. Next we need to create the new partition.\nType n to make a new partition\nType p to make this partition primary and press enter\nType 1 to make this the first partition and then press enter\nPress enter to accept the default first cylinder\nPress enter again to accept the default last cylinder\nType w to write the new partition information to the USB key\nType umount /dev/sdx1 (replacing x with your drive letter)\n\nC. The last step is to create the fat filesystem.\nType mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdx1 (replacing x with your USB key drive letter)\n\nThat's it, you should now have a restored USB key with a single fat 32 partition that can be read from any computer.\n\nA: While this may be less optimal for some right after installing Linux. The easiest fix I've found is formatting the USB on Windows. \nIf it doesn't Appear tap Start > Right Click Computer > Disk (or device) Manager > Carefully delete all the USB partitions then format the new partition.\n", "Q: Setting apache2 on ubuntu I've followed this tutorial to try and set an apache server: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-apache2-webserver-with-phpcgi-and-perl-support-in-ubuntu-server.html/comment-page-1#comments\nAt first I got a message that I could access the server but there was nothing.

I'm having a few issues with 12.04 right now when manipulating large image files, which never  used to occur when doing the same with 10.04. I noticed when I clean-installed that the swap partition it chose for itself was 3GB instead of the 6GB it was when I had 10.04 installed.\nSo if for no other reason than to see if it works I'm going to take it back up to 6GB, as seems to be recommended given I have 3GB RAM.\nI've already read the Swap-FAQ, but it doesn't address the particular area I'm interested in given my system is already up and running.\nMy plan is to I boot off the installation CD and run GParted to resize the partitions. Currently ~400GB is data in one primary partition, and Ubuntu is installed on an extended ~100GB partition where ~97GB is for the system and ~3GB is the Swap (give or take a few GB for unallocated space).\nIf I do that, will my installation remain intact or will it break anything? Comparing with Windows for example, I know resizing the system partition causes problems!\n\nA: Using GParted from the live CD on the swap partition nothing should break. The swap partition should not contain data of value, but you're probably resizing your Ubuntu partition too and therefore the usual warning: do backups. Doing backups of my installations without the home directory (Í have a separate partition for home) results in archives less than 3 GB, so space for backups should really not be an issue.\nI would suggest you do the necessary actions in GParted step by step.\nIf you somehow need to create a new swap partition you should replace the old UUID with the new one in the following files:\n/etc/fstab\n/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume\n\nThe latter one is for hibernation. Back in your system execute update-initramfs -u -k all that will update all initial ramdisks to use the new UUID of swap for hibernation.

I develop windows software .\nDoes anyone know? how I can make application/software for *buntu using a windows pc?\n\nA: Write them in a language available on both platforms.\nOne example would be to write it in Java.\n\nA: You can develop in QT which while it does work on linux and windows, is far more native to linux then java is and can run in ubuntu easily. For example, the ubuntu one client is in qt.\n\nA: You can do most of your development on Windows if you are making a cross-platform application (most open source toolkits and programming environments are cross-platform to some degree), but you would still need to test it on Ubuntu, of course.\nIf you don't like having a dedicated or dual boot system with Ubuntu, most testing can also happen in a virtual machine (if your software is not a hardware driver or such).\nMost people I know do it the other way around though—code on Ubuntu/linux and also test/release on Windows...  ;) \n\nA: Yes, you can. I am developing one right know. Is not even a browser app, but a standalone one. \nI use Netbeans. The project folder is stored on a shared directory that I can access from my Windows 7 or my Ubuntu 12.04. I compile and run from any of the systems without a problem.\nYou do have to install Netbeans or your IDE of choice in both systems and make sure to use the same version or some warnings will start popping in one and not in the other, that will probably pop in the other if you correct them in the one :p.\nIf you want to use something different from java, that creates a binary unique to the system, then you do have to specify a different directory for the output compiled binary, one for each system you want, but you can still use the same directory for the source code.\n\nA: Its not as simple as that, what language do you use?

For bash, you would need to put this line in ~/.bashrc.\n\nTo make it also randomly choose between cowsay and cowthink, you can do this: \nfortune | `ls /usr/games/cow* | shuf -n 1` -f `ls /usr/share/cowsay/cows/ | shuf -n 1`\n\nThis allows to have a one-line solution with random cowfiles, instead of painstakingly extending the Linux Mint script.\n\nA: Well, in Linux Mint there is a fun thing you could do: write a script to select a cow and display a message from fortune. I'll get to it later. Once you have the script, all you have to do is to execute it. As suggested before, edit your ~/.bashrc file and add at the end a line containing the path to your script. For example, if you have the script in your home folder and the script's filename is \"cowscript\", then you could add the following line at the end of your ~/.bashrc file:\n$HOME/cowscript\n\nNow, the script used in Linux Mint 9 is the following:\n#!/bin/bash\nRANGE=4\n\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        cow=\"small\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        cow=\"tux\"\n        ;;\n    2)\n        cow=\"koala\"\n        ;;\n    3)\n        cow=\"moose\"\n        ;;\nesac\n\nRANGE=2\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowsay\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowthink\"\n        ;;\nesac\n/usr/games/fortune | $command -f $cow\n\nBasically, it will display a random cow (either small, tux, koala, or moose) and the message will be taken from fortune. Also, this script will execute wither cowsay or cowthink, the only difference being that cowthink will display a thinking cow instead of a talking cow.\nNow, the fun thing is that you can modify the script to show more cows or to show different cows. To do that, you first need to know what cows you have installed. In a terminal, run:\ncowsay -l\n\nYou can use any of those cows. All you have to do is to edit the script: if you want to add a new cow, just copy the lines containing \"cow\" (plus the number and semi-colons) and paste them before the line that says \"esac\". Then, change the number and name of the cow, so for instance, if you want to add a cow called \"udder\", all you have to do is to add these lines before the first \"esac\":\n4)\n    cow=\"udder\"\n    ;;\n\nImportant: the second line of the file, \"RANGE=4\", must be changed also. If you add one cow, then instead of 4 use 5, also if you delete one cow, then you must use 3, and so on. Also note that the numbers that you see must be in the range from 0 to RANGE - 1. That's why RANGE is 4 and the numbers are 0, 1, 2, and 3.\nYou could also create your own cows, although that might take a bit more of work. All you have to do is to get any ASCII art you like and edit it, but it is a bit tricky. You can see how it's done here: http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow-to-make-a-cow-talk-on-terminal-startup/ However, consider that any @ and \\ symbols need to be backslashed, that is, you must put before that symbol this other symbol: \\. This might be the case for #, too (but not always). If your ASCII Art contains #, you could backslash it too, but sometimes it would be enough with just one of them... I'm not sure how to explain it, sorry. I guess you will have to try to see if it works. Also, make sure that the file you edit has the extension \".cow\"\nFinally, once you have your own cows, you can either add them to the default location (you probably will need to be superuser for that) at /usr/share/cowsay/cows, or you could add to your ~/.bashrc file this lines:\nexport COWPATH=\"/usr/share/cowsay/cows\"\n# set COWPATH so it includes user's cows\nif [ -d \"$HOME/cowfiles\" ] ; then\n    COWPATH=\"$COWPATH:$HOME/cowfiles\"\nfi\n\nBe sure to add those lines before you call your \"cowscript\". This also assumes that you have a folder called \"cowfiles\" on your home folder. Change the path if you want so it points to the folder where you have your cowfiles.\n\nA: If you want to combine cowsay and fortune to present you with a message each time you start a terminal, add the following line:\nfortune | cowsay -f tux\n\nto the file .bashrc in your home folder.\n", "Q: Making Unity Dash open with the last used Lens as the active Lens Especially with no keyboard shortcuts for custom-installed Lenses, I thought it would be nice for the Dash to always open the last used Lens for me (instead of the default Home/Global Lens). Is it possible to achieve this?\nGeneralization:\nMaybe the Dash interaction could be enhanced to make it more keyboard-friendly overall. \nAs a keyboard-centric user, I find the following flow slightly irksome:\nKeyboard :: To open the Dash via the Super key THEN Mouse :: To select the desired lens.

I recommend running updates if you're able to use Ubuntu long enough before it freezes, that's the most important thing to do if you are able to. If it hangs immediately after login, was the install really successful in the first place? You can swap the hard drive into another computer and try booting Ubuntu off that hard drive in another machine, that will help you isolate the problem.\nWhen it hangs, if it's from overheating, I highly recommend switching to Lubuntu, which uses LXDE as the desktop environment. I've got much more mileage with Lubuntu on laptops that overheat.\nAlso consider what kind of graphics card you have. Are you able to do Ctrl+Alt+F1 to swap from GUI to a CLI?

I currently only have Windows on my machine, which I plan to run along with 12.04.\n\nA: I have the same problem because I use a KVM switch with analog ports.\nBeing not digitally connected it seems that my 16x9 screen is not detected.\nI hate these automatic detections mechanisms which frequently fail.\nDevelopers these days try to build more fancyness than real value.\nWhy can't there be easy manual overrides?\nOn Windows these things work much better than on Linux.\nI found that I can use cvt 1920 1080 60 to get the mode settings for my display.\nI use:\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60\" $(cvt 1920 1080 60 | grep Modeline | sed -re 's~.*\"(.*)_.*\"~\\1~')\n\nAnd:\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1920x1080_60\n\nThen I can see the new mode in the display settings and select it.\nUnfortunately it is not persistent on reboot.\n\nA: The first post did the trick for me with a slight modification; Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below:\nxrandr --newmode $(cvt 1920 1080 60 | grep Mode | sed -e 's/.*\"/1920x1080/')\n\n\nA: It is possible that your monitor is not correctly detected because it can not be identified properly. It is a relatively common problem which affects Ubuntu as well as Windows with some monitors. If you are encountering this problem, you simply have to shutdown the computer, unplug the power cord of your monitor for more than 15 seconds (to ensure all the capacities are emptied). Then plug back the power cord of your monitor, power it on and start your computer with the Ubuntu 12.04 on your USB stick. Your monitor must always be powered on before starting the computer, otherwise the resolutions detected may be incorrect. This is true for Ubuntu as well as latest versions of Windows (at least if you don't use official proprietary drivers from nvidia or else).\nIf unplugging the monitor for a short time does not solve the problem, you should propably try to install the right proprietary driver for your graphic card via \"Additional drivers\" or by following the post of Chris Carter if no proprietary drivers are available there.\nDepending on the problem you are effectively facing, following the solution of Peter may help too.\nIf you receive a message \"signal out of range\" or equivalent from your monitor during Ubuntu startup, the solution of Jo Boxer may help.\n\nA: You could try for:\nsudo jockey-gtk\n\nwhich searches and downloads applicable drivers for you.\n\nA: Follow these instructions. \nIn Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, we can use grub-customizer to fix the problem:\n\n1. Start your machine, on ‘signal out of range’ screen press Enter. Wait a second (or try Ctrl+Alt+F1, Ctrl+ALt+F7), it will boot into Ubuntu.\n2. Once boot into Ubuntu, configure the network and install grub-customize by running following commands in terminal:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nOr directly download and install the deb from launchpad.net\n3. Launch grub-customizer. In its Preference window second tab, check and change the resolution. Remember to click ‘Save‘ the configuration \n\nNot working for me but I'm slowly getting to the bottom of it.\nInstructions from\nhttp://ubuntuguide.net/monitor-signal-out-of-range-problem-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-fresh-installation/comment-page-1/#comment-10233\n\nA: Do you have an accelerated graphics card? You may not get the correct resolution until you install the appropriate driver.\nTry out the solutions here The part headed Not recognised video cards might be the appropriate part for you both but not sure about Amen as he does not say what type of graphics he has\n\nA: The resolution should be properly detected and set on digital connections like DVI, HDMI or DisplayPort. Unfortunately that particular model does not even seem to have a digital port. If it has try a digital cable, if not try another analog cable to be sure that it's not a hardware issue. You can add custom modelines which are responsible for proper resolution detection, but instead I would suggest using a digital connection and replacing the monitor if needed.\n\nA: @Peter: This has nothing to do with windows being better. It's most likely a hardware issue of the monitor. The powersupply is going bad and no longer provides the voltage or current to keep the PNP signal that provides the information at the correct level, thus the video card can't 'hear' it clearly anylonger, that on it's turn decides to conclude that therefore the monitor is an old generic one that doesnt provide any PNP resolution data.  This is then communicated to the OS. The OS then finally switches the resolution back to the stoneage.  MANY monitors have this issue (almost looks like a design feature to phase out old displays and encourage people to buy new) \nNow, setting XRANDR to the correct value, is a nice workaround but it just doesn't repair the monitor.   I would like to see an option in the display settings that can switch on an option to be able to select these resolutions from the GUI so that EVERY GNU/Linux user (also the ones who don't have a clue about the console) can save some money. \nThis defective PNP feature smells a lot like DRM. Just look at the scale of it.  Most people don't have a clue and like good slaves carrie themselves to the shop to waiste more money on a new one that will mostlikely have the same issue...\nSo please don't fool yourself thinking that another OS is any better with detecting PNP data. \nTo make the OS better: then include all resolutions in the GUI, only use PNP for conveiniance. But don't play in the had of corporations who like to lure consumers back to the shop as soon as possible.\n", "Q: how do i install ubuntu 12.04 inside windows 7 installing ubuntu inside windows 7 is not an option available for my system i guess.\ni dont have a previous version installed on my machine as it was giving me problems regarding the grub with dual boot. is it because my machine is 64-bit ? any solution so that i dont have to restructure my hdd or format the whole laptop altogether? ram is 3gb only so i cant run it on vmware etc too gives a hard time that way. i only need it for shell scripting and c/c++/java coding\n\nA: Can't run it in VmWare? Try VirtualBox. If you only want it for shell scripting and coding, do you need a particular desktop environment? If not, I'd recommend Lubuntu, as LXDE is much lighter than Gnome (whether Unity, Gnome Shell or Gnome Classic) or KDE. Apparently some people got Ubuntu working in Microsoft VirtualPC (not supported, but can work).\n", "Q: acer travelmate 8371 doesn't charge battery since ubuntu 12.04 Since the Update to 12.04 my battery won't charge - it says it's charged to 51% - when i disconnect the powercable thee is no energy supply at all.\nHow can i figure out if it's a hardware problem or the new ubuntuversion? And how can i fix it?\n\nA: Try booting to a LiveCD or LiveUSB for the version you used to have installed.  This way, you will be running on a completely independent instance of the operating system, so if the problem persists you know it is your hardware and not the software.  You could also try a LiveCD for Ubuntu 12.04 to see if it is a configuration issue.\n", "Q: Why do I have such slow experience in web browsing on Ubuntu? I have a relatively recent laptop with decent hardware and on Windows web browsing is pretty good, but when on ubuntu, it gets so slow, I can't watch properly a video from youtube or even low quality videos from elsewhere, which lag all the time. Also images take more time to load. I've tried everything, my firefox has adblock plus, flashblock, I use flashgot to download videos and watch them on a player but I can't be downloading several MB Long videos all the time. I've tried Chromium, Firefox and Opera, Opera is the one that allows me to have more tabs open without freezing, however Flash problems remain. Chromium crashes all the time with the \"aww snap\" page.\nOn an older PC I have with Lubuntu, it's even worse, I can't open a window with a video because it will freeze the system entirely until it loads, I often have to go to windows XP if I want to browse decently. What can I do to have a better web experience?\n\nA: Multiple factors involved. If it's just to watch youtube, you may want to try Totem, it has a youtube plugin. If you have the package totem-mozilla installed, it'll hijack all flash video in your web browser. Youtube will play just fine, but then say goodbye to online flash games, etc. Other options are trying Gnash or Lightspark. Gnash is in the repositories and Lightspark can easily installed via PPA. There's also the option of viewing a fair deal in HTML5.\nAlso how much RAM do you have? Are you loading the same number of tabs in the same web browser in both Ubuntu and windows? I find Firefox to handle multiple tabs better than Chrome/Chromium, don't really use Opera.\nTo make sure you can browse decently (any OS)\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure all hardware is properly configured\n\n*use a good hosts file - not kidding this does make a difference, even if you're not scared of viruses on Ubuntu\n\n\nAnother thing you can try is a lighter browser such as Epiphany or Midori, mind you I find both to be less stable than Firefox.\n", "Q: read pdf document properties from terminal as seen in nautilus From the terminal I would like to be access the data that is readable when right clicking on a pdf file and selecting \"document\". example\nI have tried reading metadata with tools such as mminfo and pdftk but some files are password protected so they can't show me the meta data.\nHelp appreciated.\n\nA: You can use the program pdfinfo from the package poppler-utils.

I really need this package especially for my updates. Can you help me?\n\nA: The simplest way to identify packages missing from the default install is to install and run synaptic. Software Center is a replacement for Synaptic but you'll do no harm using it. When you run synaptic you'll find menu items on the left. Under the Custom Filter option, the first menu item is \"All\" and the second is \"Broken\". The menu item you want to select is \"Missing Recommends\". You'll now have a list of packages That have been removed from the initial install. Check the boxes for any packages you wish to install. To apply the selected changes click the \"apply\" icon. It should be the 3rd from the top left, hover over the icon to make sure its the apply function.

I have the following setup:\nfirst partition is windows 7 partition\nsecond partition - ubuntu 12.04 partition\nwhile installing ubuntu I installed grub2 bootloader to ubuntu partition\nmbr contains windows bootloader\nI have tried using EasyBCD to add entry to windows boot menu, with no luck - this entry just boots into grub4dos command prompt\nhow to add Ubuntu to windows boot menu?\nplease do not suggest installing grub2 to mbr or wubi..\n\nUpdate:\nI followed the instructions to install EasyBCD and add an entry to Windows boot menu to boot Ubuntu step by step. When I reboot both the NeoGrub Bootloader and the Ubuntu menu items take me to the screen below.\n\n\nA: I've just been through this as a Linux newbie this weekend and just(!) got this working. I had Windows 7 factory setup on a laptop and was trying to get Ubuntu to dual boot. I used the Windows partition manager to free up some hard disk space and then used live CD and GParted to create a /, /home and swap logical partitions. I then installed Ubuntu into those partitions. I then went back to Windows, ran EasyBCD and every way I tried (see above thread suggestions), always ended up with either with the grub> command prompt and sometimes nothing very much at all.\nThe first thing to do is check if you can use the grub> command prompt to actually boot into your ubuntu install. This will give you confidence that the install worked and will tell you what settings to use later. \n\"ls\" will give you a listing of where you are. For me, this appeared to be my Windows 7 C drive from some of the directory names it brought up. So, you need to change the root to the partition that contains Ubuntu's /boot files. For this you use the grub \"root\" command.\nGrub doesn't use sda/b/c/d for sata hard disks, instead it uses hd0 for sda, hd1 for sdb etc. The 'tab_key' is used in grub for auto complete options. I only have one hard disk so typing \"root (hd0,'tab_key'\" gave me all the options for partitions in hd0 that were available. It will help if you know which partition you've installed your /boot into but even then it's not too intuitive. I'd used GParted to create my install partitions so  knew I'd installed /boot into partition sda9 so was able to identify it relatively easy. A bit confusing because grub starts counting extended partitions from 4. The way to get grub to get my /boot partition was by typing \"root (hd0,8)\" i.e. one less than the sda9 number. Do an \"ls\" and sure enough, I could see the /boot directory a vmlinuz file and a initrd.img file in the root.\nThe next bit to do is to load the kernel and the initrd file. The kernel one was the one that threw me as you need to specify the root in normal linux terminology as part of the command. Although the actual kernel and .img file are in the /boot, they have long names. In the root there's pointers to them that save on accurate typing. Here's everything I typed, including the root command above:\nroot (hd0,8)\n\nkernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda9\n\ninitrd /initrd.img\n\nboot\n\nDoing that brought my Ubuntu up and gave me confidence that it was installed OK. Now I just needed to figure out how to automate it. This took me back to EasyBCD on Win7. Click to add a new entry (I left the original one that took me to grub> alone), and selected the NeoGrub tab and clicked Install. Following that, I clicked Configure and this brought up a menu.lst file. I added all the lines that I'd used above on the grub command line to get it to boot up and that was it. Next time I rebooted, I chose NeoGrub and I'm typing this all in from ubuntu, which looks fab and fast compared to the constant circles of delay of Win7. \nlinks I've been using all weekend....\nhttp://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/05/17/how-to-dual-boot-ubuntu-12-04-and-windows-7/2/\nhttp://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/dual-boot-windows-7-ubuntu.html\n\nA: The procedure which has worked for me is outlined below. \nDid you perform the install of the NeoGrub bootloader in step (3)? If NeoGrub is installed then there will be a \\NST folder on your C: drive.\nI think this step is sometimes left out of guides for setting up EasyBCD.\nUsing EasyBCD to Boot to GRUB from Windows Boot Menu\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Windows and install the free version of EasyBCD.\n\n*Open the EasyBCD program and select Add New Entry from the sidebar on the left. \n\n*Select the rightmost tab, NeoGrub, under \"Operating Systems\" and click the Install button.\n\nNote:  This adds the NeoGrub bootloader code to your C:\\ folder. If the install worked correctly you will see the file C:\\NeoGrub and the folder C:\\NST.\n\n*Select the Linux/BSD tab. Choose GRUB2 as the type of the entry and, optionally, edit the name of the\nentry you are about to add to the Windows Boot menu.\n\nClick the Add Entry button to add an entry to boot Linux (GRUB menu) to the Windows boot menu.\n\n*Select Edit Boot Menu from the sidebar to review your changes.\n\nNote: You can delete the entry for NeoGrub Bootloader if you wish.\nYou need the bootloader, but you do not need a boot menu entry for it unless you are using it in some other way.\n\n*Save your changes and reboot. When the Windows boot menu appears, select the EasyBCD  entry you added to boot Linux. You should see something similar to the text below.\n\nThen the GNU GRUB boot menu should appear.\n\n\nA: You can use EasyBCD, but keep in mind that this will slow down the booting of the system, so after booting to Ubuntu, change mbr in such a way that it points to the Ubuntu GRUB which will search and list all the operating systems installed in the system, which is far better than windows boot menu, also remove Ubuntu option from Windows boot menu.\n\nA: You can easily install Linux using a live disk. But unfortunately, i did not had a pendrive or cd drive when I really needed to install it. Also, softwares like Unetbootin were giving errors and it did not install. So, here is a complete guide to install Linux directly from hard-drive. I already had Windows 7 installed and I added Ubuntu 16.04 for dual boot.\nStep 1:\nFirst of all, you need to create atleast a 10 GB partition in your hard-drive. Follow this link to do so. Also give a label to the partition to make the things easier.\nThen download two files from the Ubuntu Archive\nClick here to know the names of all versions of Ubuntu. Decide your version to download and go to version-updates in the Ubuntu Archive.\nFor example, to download Ubuntu 16.04, go to xenial-updates in Ubuntu archive. Then go to main folder. Here you will get installer-amd64 (for 64-bit) and installer-i386 (for 32-bit). Select your architecture and then the rest of the path remains the same for both. ie-\n/current/images/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64(or i386)/\nClick on initrd.gz and linux (for 64-bit) or vmlinuz (for 32-bit) to download these files.\nCreate a new folder and name it boot in the newly created partition. Put these 2 files in the boot folder.\nStep 2:\nInstall EasyBCD from Here. Click on Add new entry and in the Operating System, open NeoGrub tab and click on install.\nStep 3:\nRestart your computer and choose NeoGrub Bootloader from the available options. Simply write this commands one by one.\ngrub> root = (hd0,\n[Press Tab to list all the volumes available on your primary hard disk. Write 1 instead of 0 if you created partition in second hard-disk]\ngrub> root = (hd0,n)\n[Replace n with the number of the new partition.]\nThen type these commands in order\n\nkernel /boot/linux     [Note: type vmlinuz instead of linux for 32-bit]\ninitrd /boot/initrd.gz\nboot\n\nNow it will take you to installer (Mouse won`t work. You need to control with keyboard).\nSolutions for a few common errors\nI faced a few problems while installing.Here is a list for you.\n\n*\n\n*Mount Point - When you select your partition while installation, you need to format the partition as Ext4 journaling file system and select the Mount Point as /\nYou won`t get such nice GUI but you will know what I mean to say\n\n\n*SWAP Partition - It will ask you to create a swap partition for linux. Select No for now. You can create another patition for linux-swap later.\n\n\n*Incomplete installation - Firstly, I had created only 6 GB partition for Ubuntu. So the installer crashed during the installation (it had already completed 64%) and then I needed to start from step 1. So, I recommend creating a pertition of atleast 15 GB.\n\n\n*Extra Softwares - During installation, it asked me whether I want to install extra softwares or not. It included Blender, GIMP, etc. Skip it for now. The installation of OS requires 5 GB, but installing these softwares were also one of the reasons why the installation crashed before.\n\n\n*GNOME Desktop - You want the nice looking Ubuntu UI, then you must include GNOME Desktop during installation of extra softwares. It will ask the type of desktop environment, gdm3 or lightdm. Choose anyone you want. But I recommend lightdm for computers with low RAM as it is faster than gdm3.\n\n\n*grub rescue - I formatted the partition where I installed Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit as I wanted to install 64-bit OS. Then on next boot, I got this error of grub rescue. It was not easy for me solve this problem because it now required an installation disk for repair but I didn`t had any. Follow this link to solve your problem.\nAlthough I had given a very long explanation about installation process, I can guarantee that you will be using Ubuntu in just 3 hours if you get no extra errors.\n", "Q: Ubuntu gives \"incorrect password\" warning Every since I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04, I keep getting an error message saying, \"incorrect password\".

If you do not have optimus, you do not need or want that. vga-switcharoo is for the same purpose. (I forget the difference)\nIf nouveau works for you, you should use that over nvidia, as Ubuntu developers cannot fix problems in the nvidia driver if you end up having them, this is due to the nouveau driver being Free and Open Source Software\n", "Q: what's the name of the program/app/daemon that \"plays\" music in rhythmbox when i try to quit it with close button? I'm using ubuntu 12.04 with gnome-shell and \"mediaplayer-extension\" from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/.  When i hit the close button on a music player, like rhythmbox 2.9x, it hides somewhere, but it keeps playing music in the background. But if i try to do the same on another distro, when I hit the close button, rhythmbox quits instantly. \nThe question is: What's the program/app/daemon's name that \"plays\" music in background even if i try to quit rhythmbox (or any music player without a tray-icon) with \"close\" button? If i try to remove that program, will rhythmbox (or any music player) quit on \"close\" button? (because i need that)\nI know it isn't \"mediaplayer-extension\" nor \"rhythmbox-client\", but i can't identify the program. Can somebody help me? Thanks.\n(My native language isn't english so i don't know if it's well drafted.)  \nedit\nFor clarification, what I'm wondering is:\nWhy does rhythmbox hide on Ubuntu by hitting on \"close\" button instead of quitting it?\nWhy does rhythmbox quit on Fedora by hitting on \"close\" button instead of hiding it?\nIs there a program that modifies rhythmbox's behaviour in ubuntu that fedora doesn't have, or viceversa?\nedit 2 \nIt doesn't only happen in rhythmbox. If i use another music player, like quodlibet or banshee (both without tray icon), it keeps playing music on Ubuntu, but quits instantly on Fedora when i hit on the same \"close\" button. \nIs that (hide-on-close) a normal behaviour that i can only find on Ubuntu? \n\nA: It's still Rhythmbox, but I suspect that you may have a different version of Rhythmbox on the other distros which is why you see different behavior.  There has been some back and forthing over the behavior of Rhythmbox's close button. \nBut currently, on Ubuntu 12.04, the Rhythmbox close button is simply hiding the player's shell.  The player is still running and playing your tracks. \n\nA: The purpose (and why you probably installed it) of the GNOME shell extension Media Player Indicator is to control the media players in your system over a indicator applet. This includes starting and stopping the player via the MPRIS D-Bus implementation that Rhythmbox offers. There is a similar implementation in the Unity Sound Menu/Indicator Sound.\nThe way it should operate by design is that whenever you close the window of a media player while it is playing it should minimize. The application that plays sound still will be Rhythmbox.

There is a difference between the 5300 and 5100 Model. While the 5300 provides connections for three antennas, the 5100 only provides connections for two antennas.

On a regular file, the read permission bit means the file can be opened and read. On a directory, the read permission means you can list the contents of the directory.\nWrite permission. On a regular file, this means you can modify the file, aka write new data to the file. In the case of a directory, the write permission means you can add, remove, and rename files in the directory. This means that if a file has the write permission bit, you are allowed to modify the file's contents, but you're allowed to rename or delete the file only if the permissions of the file's directory allow you to do so.\nExecute permission. In the case of a regular file, this means you can execute the file as a program or a shell script. On a directory, the execute permission (also called the \"search bit\") allows you to access files in the directory and enter it, with the cd command, for example. However, note that although the execute bit lets you enter the directory, you're not allowed to list its contents, unless you also have the read permissions to that directory. \n\n", "Q: formatting hard drive before installing Ubuntu I want to install ubuntu on my pc and i have windows xp already installed on it. While formatting the os will it erase on the data on other partitioned drives also or will erase on that partitioned drive which i will choose before installing. i have  partition drive C, D and E respectively and windows xp os is installed in C drive. please suggest what to do i have not taken backup of files stores in d and E partitioned drive.   \n\nA: Firstly, backup anything you want to keep.  When partitioning, it is very easy to lose all data on the harddrive if you don't know what you are doing\nThen given C:\\, D:\\ and E:\\ in windowsXP are distinct partitions, you'll most likely have to sacrifice (at least) one of those three partitions to install Ubuntu. You'll need feasibly at least 8GB hard disk space for Ubuntu.\nWhen you boot Ubuntu from CD/DVD or USB device, go through the wizard (one of the only wizards you'll get in Linux) and when it comes to choosing how Ubuntu will be installed on your hard drive, pick the last option (whether it be \"do something else\", \"manual partition\", \"for advanced users\", etc.). The exact wording will vary from one version of Ubuntu to another, but in my experience it's always been the last option. You should be familiar with your C:\\ D:\\ and E:\\ partitions (they'll all be NTFS or FAT and you should be able to recognize them based on how much disk space each partition takes...if not you can always mount them and look through them in the file manager).\nYou'll want to make a SWAP partition, which should be double your RAM (if you have 1GB RAM, make a 2GB SWAP partition). Next make an ext4 partition (at least 8GB...you can adjust the size of Linux filesystem partitions but it does take a long time) and make its mounting point / (that's right, a simple forward slash). That way Ubuntu will be installed on \"drive /\". You can create mounting points for your NTFS/FAT partitions (don't reformat them, simply \"use partition\" as NTFS (or FAT) and write in your mounting point...such as /media/drive_d or /media/windows. Follow the wizard to its end and then you will have an operational Linux computer (with a dual boot if you kept your XP partition, the bootloader will automatically detect it).\nAlternatively, if all you want to do is partition your hard drive, it is possible to grab a live CD just to run gParted, mind you gParted runs quite nicely in an Ubuntu live session as well.\nHere's an old screenshot of that important step that takes place during the Ubuntu install wizard:\n\n", "Q: Unity Launcher Log I'm making a custom launcher/desktop file to place in the Unity Launcher Bar.

I've already finished downloading and pasting the files it told me to do, But it didn't work for me. Then I found a page where someone had tried it and it worked for them. Does anyone know how they got it to work?\nThe page with the directions.\nThe page where it worked.\nI also found this\nDoes anyone know what it is talking about? I've already downloaded lxBDplayer, but I encountered a problem when installing the lcbdaacs plugins. Are there any other ways to install the lxbdaacs plugin?\n\nA: The problem is, that there is currently no program or library like libdvdcss2 (which enables VLC or other programs to watch DVDs) for Blu-Rays.\nYou either can rip protected Blu-Rays with a program of you choice, or you have a look into MakeMKV.\nUsing MakeMKV - after kompiling it, which is fairly easy - enables you to do both (as far as I know). But watching the Blu-Rays without ripping them first means, you need to know, how to watch a stream with a program like VLC, because that is what they do. And you need to check first, which chapter of the disk you want to see - you need to specify the correct chapter in VLC, otherwise nothing happens! The rest (language selection and so on) works out-of-the-box. But be aware, that this is a) work in progress and b) limited for testing (Blu-Ray only).\n\nA: So from what I'm finding I may have a solution. Can't promise this will work, but I don't think it can hurt to try.\nFirst I'd recommend installing an updated version of libaacs0 and libbluray1 from the motumedia mplayer daily PPA, and VLC from Videolan Stable-daily PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:motumedia/mplayer-daily\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:videolan/stable-daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen install the two libraries.\nsudo apt-get install libaacs0 libbluray1\n\nThen you'll need to make the directory and download the file to it.\nmkdir ~/.config/aacs\ncd ~/.config/aacs\nwget http://vlc-aacs.whoknowsmy.name/files/KEYDB.cfg\n\nFrom the instructions on \nthey want you to place libaacs.so.0 in /usr/lib or /usr/lib64\nWhere this one is installed to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu or /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu\nMy thoughts is that would be a possible reason.\nI would try this myself but unfortunately I do not have a Blu-Ray drive. So please let me know if it works.\n\nA: blu-play is a script that will play your blu-rays (without ripping them first). It pipes MakeMKV into VLC.\nSee How to play Blu-Rays in Ubuntu Linux. The installation is automatic. You just have to copy and paste a few things into Terminal.\nAnd here's the blu-play script.\n\nA: Here's what you can do, to start open a terminal window, you can do this through the Dash, or by keystroking \"Ctrl + T\". Afterwards, what you may want to do is copy and paste the following commands into terminal. You can also, if more comfortable, type them manually. You can copy one by one, or all at once, it doesn't matter. Remember, when in terminal the past command is  \"Ctrl + Shift + V\" instead of \"Ctrl + V\".\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:n-muench/vlc\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libaacs0 libbluray-bdj libbluray1\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThat will only get blu-ray to work in VLC. We now need aacs folders, and to download the keys. We just enter a couple more commands into terminal. \ncd ~/\nmkdir -p ~/.config/aacs/\ncd ~/.config/aacs/ && wget http://vlc-bluray.whoknowsmy.name/files/KEYDB.cfg\n\nYou should be all set now, enjoy your blu-ray movies! \nAll information and alternative methods can be found here.\n\nA: The instructions in the first link have worked for me on OS X and Ubuntu.\nOS X worked as described. But in Ubuntu, when trying to play a Blu-ray, VLC told me there was an error that could not be fixed. \nMy problem was that, since the /usr/lib64 directory didn't exist, I just put libaacs.so.0 in /usr/lib.  Then it occurred to me, since I'm running 64-bit Ubuntu and 64-bit VLC, I should try creating the /usr/lib64 directory and putting the file in there.  Voila, it worked!\nAlso, I have more luck if I tell Ubuntu to ignore the disc, or open it as a folder, then open VLC manually, and do File->Open Disc, with the checkbox for \"Ignore DVD Menus\" checked (yes, even on Blu-ray).  This is opposed to having Ubuntu open VLC automatically when a Blu-ray is inserted.\n", "Q: VirtualBox doesn't recognize USB \nPossible Duplicate:\nSet up USB for Virtualbox \n\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 as host and Win7 as guest. I installed VirtualBox 4.1 and Extension Pack 4.1 from Oracle website. I also enabled USB 2.0 from Settings of my VM. My Win7 VM doesn't regconize USB (Flash Drive and Kindle Fire).\nHow to fix it?\nUpdate: I added my current user to vbusers group but it doesn't work as well.\n\nA: I had the same problem and fixed it by clicking in the VirtualBox group of my user. You can access it installing gnome-system-tools (it does not come with Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin), either via the Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic or by typing in the terminal: \nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\nRemember that to paste in the terminal you have to use CTRL+SHIFT+V, as opposed to CTRL+V \nYou will probably have to enter your password to allow the installation and add a Y (as in yes) to finish installing the packages. \nThen you head to your Dash home and type users. You will see two applications. The good one is Users and Groups. \nYou then have to click on Advanced settings for your user and enter your password.\nNow you will be shown a window with three tabs. Click on User Privileges.  Find the line that says Use Virtualbox virtualization solution and then OK. \n\nYou may be asked to enter your password again. Then click on Close and log-out and log-in again. \nWhen you start VirtualBox you should see a whole bunch of new USB devices. \nGood luck!\n\nA: You need install VirtualBox Guest Addition into guest machine. \nMay be also you need restart vboxdrv service.\n\nA: Dont forget to add you as a vboxusers user. You have to be in the vboxusers group.\nsudo adduser $USER vboxusers\n\nTo verify it: \n$ groups\nyourUserName : yourUserName adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin scanner sambashare vboxusers\n\nIf this still doesn't work, Log out and log back in.\n\nA: (assuming you've already installed guest additions)\nYou also need to set USB filters so that the USB devices get sent to the guest OS.\nFrom the main Virtualbox window open the Settings dialog, then the USB section, then click the little \"add filter\" button on the right side of the screen.  You should be able to create a filter from any currently connected USB devices.\nAfter you've done this (maybe restart to be sure the host OS isn't capturing any of the USB devices for itself--Ubuntu will try to automount the flash drive so you might also want to check and make sure that it is unmounted too) then boot into the guest OS and you should see your USB devices.\nGood luck.\nEdit: note on USB filters\nIt's my understanding that a device being used by a guest OS with a USB filter will not be accessible by the host OS while the guest OS is running.  Therefore, one should choose carefully what usb devices to create filters for.\nYou should create USB filters for things that you plan on only using with the guest OS (often peripherals that don't work with the host OS and will only work with the guest OS) and when you won't require being able to access the device from the host OS while the guest OS is running.  For example I have a USB banking dongle from my bank, ICBC, that is not compatible with Linux so I use a virtualized installation of Windows XP for banking and use a USB filter to grab the USB dongle.\nExamples of good devices to create filters for:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB banking dongles that only work with guest OS\n\n*e-readers (Kindle,Nook,etc.) that you plan on using only (or primarily) with the guest OS.\n\n*external soundcards that only work with the guest OS or require the guest OS for full functionality\n\n\nExamples of bad devices to create filters for:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB input devices (mouses or keyboards) that you would like to use with the host and guest OSes.  Virtualbox will allow the guest OS access to these devices by default so there is no need for the guest OS to directly control them (well, I could think of some specialized reasons but I will digress...).\n\n*USB storage devices that you want the guest and the host OSes to both be able to access at the same time.  Instead, mount the drive on the host OS and use shared folders to share the drive to the guest OS.\n\n", "Q: Remove memcached from ubuntu I have install memcached from source using these commands\ncd /usr/local/src\nwget http://danga.com/memcached/dist/memcached-1.2.4.tar.gz\ntar zxvf memcached-1.2.4.tar.gz\ncd memcached-1.2.4\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\nNow i want to remove it, how can i remove it from ubuntu.\n\nA: \ncd /usr/local/src/memcached-1.2.4\n\nmake uninstall\n\nif there is`n have make uninstall command you can just delete this folder   /usr/local/src/memcached-1.2.4\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 Server remote access A IT Tech person set us up a Ubuntu Server 11.10 fileserver is there a way that you can remote access the file on the server, I know that it can me done but I'm not sure if it have been setup. how to you know if it has been setup & how to access it. & is there a way reset the username & Password as the IT tech didn't tell use this information & if I call him back out to have a look at it, he will charge us $100 an hour.\n\nA: If a ssh-server has been installed on your server (most of the time a ssh server is installed on servers) you can access it using ssh command.\nssh urusername@urserverip\n\nIf you can access it using ssh you can change your password or add a new user (You can do all the administration work).\n", "Q: cannot boot ubuntu 12.04 after dual-boot installation on hp xw8200 I have a 160GB drive and a 2TB drive (both internal) on a HP xw8200\nI have windows xp on the 160 GB drive. \npartitioned a /boot 1GB, 10GB swap, 100GB /, and a 400GB /home on the 2TB drive.\nChose to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside XP, but just before the installation was complete, error about grub not being able to install.\nTried boot-repair, but still cannot boot into Ubuntu.\nPls. find details at http://paste.ubuntu.com/998508/\nYour help would be greatly appreciated,\nBalu\n\nA: I have the same problem trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 along side Windows 7 on a 2TB internal.

Copy that to the proper location.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copying: cp /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n*Restart xserver: service gdm start\n\n*Exit from root: exit\n\n*Return to tty7: ctrl-alt-f7.\n", "Q: Apache2 collecting unique visitors, How? I have a cloud server running apache2 for hosting my website, while attempting to monetise it, I keep getting asked to supply proof of unique visits per month.

I just got rid of adwaita theme in my ubuntu install, but the blue striped wallpaper is still there, how do I find it and remove it manually or run command in terminal to delete it?\n\nA: You should delete the folder /usr/share/themes/Adwaita with either this command in a terminal:\nsudo rm -r /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/\nor press Alt+F2, enter gksu nautilus /usr/share/themes and your password when asked, select the folder \"Adwaita\" and press Shift+Del.\n", "Q: Marking packages as non-removable / non-installable My machine resides in a corporate domain and have CFEngine installed, for automated configuration and maintenance purposes. Configuration is pulled automatically into few thousand computers from one place, and my machine is just one of those.  \nI'm root and can change the system in the way I want, but don't want to touch CFEngine files at all.\nProblem:\nAdobe recently released a new Flash version (11.2) that fixes some security issues, but I have version 11.0r1. After new version release Chrome won't automatically execute Flash plugin, and shows the message every time I visit the page with a flash content:\nAdobe Flash Player was blocked because it is out of date.\n\nAlong with message there are two buttons, Run this time and Update plug-in....\nBoth buttons works as expected, and update works as well. But after some short period of time new Flash plugin is automatically removed from the machine and old Flash package is installed back, because of CFEngine, where old Flash package is marked as mandatory.\nQuestion:\nIs it possible to tell apt that some particular packages are non-removable, or non-installable, so CFEngine will fail installing old Flash package while will succeed with others?\nOr any other ways of permanently updating Flash?\n\nA: You can \"hold\" a package in Ubuntu. \n\nHolding a package basically means you're telling the package manager to keep the current version no matter what. This is useful if more recent version of a currently working program breaks after an update.\n\nYou can do it via Synaptic or on the command-line via apt/dpkg. The command-line version to hold a package is:\necho package_name hold | dpkg --set-selections\n\nUbuntu Community Documentation has a more complete guide explaining how to pin or hold packages.\n\nAnswer above is ripped from here. Following solved the problem:\necho adobe-flashplugin hold | dpkg --set-selections\n\n", "Q: QT Installation Missing compiler I have used Linux in the past but not for a long time and so I am a bit rusty so apologise if I am asking something obvious or in the wrong stackexchange site.\nThere are a few things with regards to how I have to use Ubuntu that are likely important:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have to use it virtually, so it is installed in a Virtualbox\n\n*I do not have access to an internet connection due to company policy.

The symptoms were the same: I could ssh to server without any problems, but sshfs command failed.\nTo enable SFTP on Synology server go to Control Panel -> File Services -> FTP tab -> SFTP section.\n\nA: I've had issues in the past where sshfs was acting weird.  First thing you really should do after installing sshfs is restart your machine, or at least X, once you've added yourself to the fuse group.\nThis error is typically seen when a user is not in the fuse group, or if allow_other in fuse is not enabled.\nThere have been times where my ssh key was causing issues.  I've had to explicitly tell sshfs what key file to use, even when ssh was configured for it (~/.ssh/config).\n\n\n*\n\n*sshfs -oIdentityFile=/full/path/to/id_rsa user@machine\nAnother solution is to use your /etc/fstab and add a new entry here:\nsshfs#USER@MACHINE:/remote/path/ /mnt/local/path/      fuse    user,_netdev,auto_cache,reconnect,uid=1000,gid=1000,IdentityFile=/full/path/to/.ssh/id_rsa,idmap=user,allow_other    0       2\n\nThis tells your machine to mount /remote/path to /mnt/local/path.  It's saying that this mount will be a fuse filesystem.  There are a few other settings that allow things such as mounting when networking becomes available, automatically re-connecting if there is a disconnect, etc.\nThe idmap and allow_other portion allow users within the fuse group to mount the filesystem.  It will also help map the permissions to match up to the user and group also specified.\nIn this example, you could then run the following to get the filesytem mounted:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount /mnt/local/path/\n\n*ls /mnt/local/path/\n\nA: I just had the same problem. The reason was SFTP subsystem not being enabled on the server (SSHFS is using it). The solution was adding the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server:\nSubsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server\n\n\nA: If you have iptables firewall rules set up on your server, it might've locked you out while you've been tinkering with sshfs - which would also result in Connection reset by peer.\n", "Q: How do I disable the screenshot sound? I am not holding a camera, I do not need to hear a shutter sound to know I pressed the Print Screen key.\nOther suggestions on the site encourage people to disable event sounds, but I use these.\nSo it something I can hack out of the sound theme?\n\nA: Although I've not tested it, but it seems that /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/screen-capture.oga is the sound you're talking about.\nTry renaming or moving it.\nAlso, in the properties of screen-capture.oga it is said it has as target the file camera-shutter.oga. so, it is a link to the later. i guess touching any of these would eliminate the sound\n\nA: Another proposed solution is by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the command: sudo mv /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter.oga /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter-backup.oga\n\n*Run the command after:  sudo ffmpeg -f lavfi -i anullsrc -t 0.5 -c:a libvorbis /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter.oga\nffmpeg comes with Ubuntu on a fresh installation, and the plugin anullsrc generates silence, outputting it as an Ogg Vorbis file format using the libvorbis library. It needs to be named as an OGA file, due to symbolic links associated with it. It needs to be 0.5 seconds long, otherwise, it may take a while for the screenshot feature to finish its job.\nTested on a clean installation of Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS.\nSource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32017827/how-to-create-silent-ogg-audio-file\n\nA: Either disable system sound effects or, I am assuming you want to disable only the screen shot sound, move or rename /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter.oga\nsudo mv /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter.oga /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter-disabled.oga\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Click on the sound icon at the upper right corner of the screen.\n\n*Now click on the sound setting.\n\n*Now click on sound effect\n\nNow mute sound from here.\n\n*You have done. No Screenshot sound from now onwards.\n\n\nA: You temporarily rename the shutter sound file:\nsudo mv -i /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/screen-capture.oga /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/screen-capture-disabled.oga\n\nThe use of -i helps to avoid accidentially overriding an old backup you have.\nImportant: You may need to logout and login again, in case the sound is cached in memory. For me login/logout was sufficient, but if that is not sufficient try rebooting.\nTo reactivate it move the sound file back:\nsudo mv -i /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/screen-capture-disabled.oga /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/screen-capture.oga\n\nYou may need to logout/login again.\nNote: In my system (Ubuntu 20.04) screen-capture.oga is a link to camera-shutter.oga, that's why the solutions moving instead camera-shutter.oga work as well.\n", "Q: Migrating from Thunderbird to Microsoft Outlook Is there a way to migrate from Thunderbird running on Ubuntu back to Microsoft Outlook running on Windows 7?\n\nA: This is not possible without any external solution.\nFew months ago, I have solved the same issue by email conversion tool.\n\nA: I do not know why you want to to that :).

Using the minimal ISO, it's possible to install and run lubuntu-core on a PC with only 64 MB of RAM. We consider 128 MB of RAM the minimal requirements for a usable Lubuntu Desktop system.

In that case, we recommend using the low-memory web browser called xxxterm, which is available from the Universe repository, which is enabled by default.\n\nA: You will need to go back very far to find something that requiers only 64 mb of RAM. the 8.04 server requires 128 mb of RAM as a minimum.

Does the Debian/Ubuntu package infrastructure has some way of marking packages so that they never get uninstalled, no matter the pinning of other packages?\nMy problem is that, sometimes, packages installed by Puppet (coming from non-standard repositories, of course) cause other packages to get uninstalled -- in particular, openssh-{server,client}.\nThe way this happens is that package A and B depend on different versions of package C. If A is installed and one asks to install B, then the version of C changes. The new version of C is incompatible with A, so A gets uninstalled.\nThe funny thing is that the process is then reversed, as, on the next run, Puppet notices that A is not installed and tries to install it.\nSo, basically, I want to make sure A never gets uninstalled, which would prevent B from getting installed. That would be reported as an error, making me aware of the issue.\nIf anyone cares, Puppet uses the following command to install packages:\n/usr/bin/apt-get -q -y -o DPkg::Options::=--force-confold install <package>\n\n\nA: You need to \"hold\" the packages so that apt-get upgrade never removes them as part of upgrading to a newer version.\necho \"package-name hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\nHowever, note that explicitly doing an apt-get install package-name WILL override the hold, while an apt-get remove package-name WILL uninstall it.\nIf you pin it to a specific version with a priority of 1001 or greater, even apt-get install will NOT upgrade it, but it can still be removed.\n\nA: This can probably be solved by adding the this to apt.conf[.d]:\nAptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver \"true\";\n\nAnd to site.pp in puppet:\nPackage { provider => 'aptitude' }\n\nHaven't tested that properly yet though.\n", "Q: Can I access my home PC from the office with SSH? I want to use my home pc at my office, without literally taking it to my office.\nI would like to have a simpler solution than TeamViewer, cause I'm usually using Live distros at my work place, so SSH would be a great solution if it actually can do the same job as \"Remote Desktop\".\nIf that isn't possible, at least give me the commands to use terminal of my home computer from my office computer.\n\nA: I normally access my home PC through SSH (no GUI).\nTo do that, you should first config your router in order to grant SSH port forwarding. You can usually access the router configuration pages by looking up the IP of the gateway (Connection Information > Default Route). Most modern routers have presets for configuring several applications, including SSH. If you need to forward the port manually, though, set it so that any incoming connections through port 22 will be routed to the local IP of your home computer.\nThen, you need to install the SSH deamon on your home PC:\nsudo apt-get install SSH\n\nAfter this, you'll be able to access from client PCs with a simple:\nssh user@IP\n\nwhere IP is the IP of your home PC. You may want to make it \"static\", and for this I can suggest to configure a host on http://www.no-ip.com and then install noip2 on Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you do not have a static IP, nor a public network IP, and have a personal server, you can try : https://github.com/fatedier/frp .\nIt can build a access node as a proxy center.\nHome PC connect to the frp, and Office PC connect to the frp, the frp will transport Office PC network packages to Home PC.\n", "Q: MAAS nodes hung at commisioning Got another machine up and running 12.04.

I've gone through the bugs  and tried everything but no fix has worked. Can't even remove the node to start over.  Any advice would be helpful.\n\nA: Check the clocks on the machines.

I guess the tittle says it all: I installed apache on my ubuntu(11.10), which repository do I add to automatically update it?\n\nA: Apache will automatically update to the latest available version for your distribution if you installed it from the Ubuntu repositories via any of the available methods: Software Center, Synaptic, or apt-get/aptitude from the terminal.\nSometimes the very latest versions of software are only available for the latest Ubuntu version, which yours is not.

I may be an alien around here, but here's my problem: the speed limit on old Ubuntu releases (= before 11) was very very fast. It was really great for me.\nNow, on Ubuntu 11, they may have thought: \"who will ever want that speed? Nobody! So let's put the maximum speed to a lower limit\".\nIt's so stupid that they tried to narrow down the speed to some other famous OS. If Linux is more powerful, why remove some of its power? I don't get that.\nSo is there any way to override that speed limit and get my keyboard as fast as it is on other previous versions?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 15.10 and later the settings have moved.\nTo get approximately 90 cps repeat rate and 150 ms delay:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard delay 150\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat-interval 11\n\nAt these high repeat rates I would recommend to stay as close to a multiple of your screen refresh rate as possible. This will help you stop at the wanted location as the movement is easier to follow.\nIf we take the default example of a 60 Hz display this works out to one of these repeat intervals:\n30  cps = 1000/30  ≈ 33 ms (30.3  cps)\n60  cps = 1000/60  ≈ 16 ms (62.5  cps)\n90  cps = 1000/90  ≈ 11 ms (90.9  cps)\n120 cps = 1000/120 ≈ 8  ms (125.0 cps)\n\n\nA: Go to System-> Preferences-> Keyboard, and adjust the Repeat Keys Speed slider to the far right. On later systems you access this control using the Unity Launcher's System Settings--the button with the wrench. The control panel is the same.\n\nA: Given that this issue hasn't been fixed yet, and can be very frustrating, I here's a workaround:\nInitially I used xset r rate, but the problem with it is that it's not persistent after sleep/awake, and sometimes the desktop reverts to limited rate at random times (probably gnome settings daemon does something which causes reinforcing the settings).\nI was uselessly changing my old gconf keyboard settings, only to discover that the setting has been migrated to gsettings. The value limit is hardcoded in the system settings application (gnome-control-center in file ./panels/keyboard/gnome-keyboard-panel.ui:877).\nYou can easily override it:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard repeat-interval 15\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard delay 150\n\nAs long as you don't change your settings from the gui, this setting should be persistent.\n\nA: You can temporarily override Ubuntu's max keyboard rate using the xset command if you're using GNOME 3 on Ubuntu > 10.04.  Example:\nxset r rate 220 160\n\nYou can also try adding (uncomenting) the following in /etc/kbd/config:\nKEYBOARD_RATE=\"160\"\nKEYBOARD_DELAY=\"220\"\nEdit: corrected an inconsistency in the examples.\n\nA: I don't think that the UI for this is especially intuitive but, I find it hard to believe that the available settings are not adequate for your needs. \nOn v3.26.2 at least, the closer you drag the bar to the left the faster the repeat is. This is equivalent to the following:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat-interval 0\n\n", "Q: Developer tools --> Pascal Desde ya, gracias por dejarme participar.

The upgrade to 12.04 should have installed a newer kernel. Perhaps you need to update your grub default, or manually select a different kernel during boot?\n\nA: This is what you want:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.32-34\n\nUPDATE:\nSince you are running 12.04 (which I didn't noticed), these kernel headers are not available there. Precise got released with 3.2.14 (3.2.0-23.36).\nOptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*One of the options could be to download your kernel headers from 10.04 repo.  \n\n*Another option would be to update to latest kernel release for 12.04, but this might lead to other problems.\n\n\nA: For an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS system, you are running quite an old kernel. The current generic PAE kernel version in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is 3.2.0-24-generic-pae. The generic PAE kernel version that came with 12.04 LTS when it was first released was 3.2.0-23-generic-pae. The kernel you're currently running is not provided in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS at all, which is why you cannot install headers for it. Your currently running kernel is from a previous Ubuntu release.\nUnless you need to run such an old kernel, you should just use a newer kernel, and that will solve the problem. If you install the linux-image-generic-pae package, you'll get the latest stable kernel for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. If you install the linux-headers-generic-pae package, you'll get the latest headers. As you receive updates, both the kernel and headers will be updated for security and stability, and they will always correspond to each other (so the headers package will enable the compilation and installation of kernel modules for the kernel provided by the image package).\nIf you find that even with that installed, you are booting into the old kernel, then you may need to modify your GRUB2 configuration. If this happens, please provide details in your question.\nIf you need to run this very old kernel, please also provide details about what you need this for. For example, did you have to manually select this old kernel to boot successfully?\n", "Q: I think someone logged into my computer at work I went to get breakfast in the cafeteria and when I came back I noticed my lockscreen hadn't faded, as if it was accessed in the past 5 minutes.\nThere is the log file snippet for the keyword 'guest':\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 groupadd[3518]: group added to /etc/group: name=guest-cA5vc1, GID=126                                                                             │nd\nic│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 groupadd[3518]: group added to /etc/gshadow: name=guest-cA5vc1                                                                                    │co\nns│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 groupadd[3518]: new group: name=guest-cA5vc1, GID=126                                                                                             │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 useradd[3522]: new user: name=guest-cA5vc1, UID=115, GID=126, home=/, shell=/bin/bash                                                             │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 usermod[3527]: change user 'guest-cA5vc1' password                                                                                                │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 chage[3532]: changed password expiry for guest-cA5vc1                                                                                             │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 chfn[3535]: changed user 'guest-cA5vc1' information                                                                                               │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 usermod[3543]: change user 'guest-cA5vc1' home from '/' to '/tmp/guest-cA5vc1'                                                                    │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 su[3548]: Successful su for guest-cA5vc1 by root                                                                                                  │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 su[3548]: + ??? root:guest-cA5vc1                                                                                                                 │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 su[3548]: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user guest-cA5vc1 by (uid=0)                                                                   │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 su[3548]: pam_unix(su:session): session closed for user guest-cA5vc1                                                                              │\nMa│May 21 10:24:44 machine-12 lightdm: pam_unix(lightdm-autologin:session): session opened for user guest-cA5vc1 by (uid=0)\n\nI had never used a guest account before so it appears that the guest account had been created when someone logged into it. Is this the case?\n\nA: The log file indicates that someone logged on as guest from the login screen.\nThe guest account in Ubuntu is created dynamically when someone selects it from the login screen. By default Ubuntu is (or should be) configured so that you cannot access other users' documents or perform any administrative tasks while using the guest account.

I have a C2D 2.66, 2 GB RAM, 320 GB HDD.\n\nA: Don't use Unetbootin. Try Universal USB Installer. It's easier and it gives you more options of distributions. Here goes the link:\nUniversal USB Installer\n\nA: Using UNETBOOTIN is very easy. Just install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nThen run it by pressing Alt+F2 and entering unetbootin.\nEnter your password and then you'll see the main menu. Tick the second radio button (Disk image) and browse to the ISO file of the distribution you want to make the live disk of. Make sure the pendrive is empty, or else format it to FAT through Disk Utility. Mount it again if you format it, and it'll be detected by UNETBOOTIN. Then the wizard will do the work and you'll have you disk ready. \nBut remember, there is  difference. Unetbootin creates a live version of the distro, which is primarily used to test it in live mode (without installing) or for installation of the distro to a system. On the other hand, Startup Disk creator makes your usb stick ready as a distro itself, so that you can use it as a portable OS. \nSince you say that your system is showing boot error, I suggest you reset your BIOS and set it to boot again from USB drives. Besides, you should format your drive once, before creating the startup disk.

The Raspberry Pi is an ARM based computer, so you have to use a version of linux (and all software) specifically compiled for it.\nIn addition, the ARM instruction set is older than Ubuntu supports (see http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs ), so you may have to use Debian which is similar to Ubuntu in the mean time.\n", "Q: Is there now any way to convert mp3 files to m4a or aac 192kbit?

Please don't suggest using another format - i thought this through as far as it goes. \nThe problem here is: \n\n\n*\n\n*ffmpeg obvioulsy can't convert to a higher bitrate than 152k. Even when it says it does so the resulting files still have 152k instead of 192k. \n\n*ffmpeg also has/had a bug not writing the bitrate into the audio file tags which means when testing you have to calculate the bitrate manually by dividing the filesize by the length of the audio in seconds (resulting in 152k - see above) \n\n*choosing faac as converter gets me the same results \n\n*other programs don't work reliably (see this thread Howto convert audio files to *.m4a?)\nI know that this is not an original new problem but I am wondering if there is still no way to convert with ubuntu/kubuntu 12.04 after a lot time passed and I can't find some of the bug issues mentioned in the other thread anymore. \nSo: Is there a solution after all?\n\nA: I think I found the solution right here: \nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/format-junkie-convert-your-media-files-to-all-the-popular-formats.html \nIt's called format junkie and it converts to 192kbit m4a (aac) without problems. \nCheck it out - it's a bit flashy but a really simple and yet powerful media converter for images, audios, videos and even iso-files! \nSorry for answering my own question, but for me I consider it solved. :-) \nthx for reading, \npiedro\n\nA: I don't know if it has the same bitrate bug as ffmpeg, but VLC has a useful file conversion option.\nChoose Media > Convert / Save\nSelect your files using Add... then  click Convert / Save\nSelect Audio - AAC (MP4) under the profile and then click the edit profile button next to it, then on the second tab there is a bit-rate pull down menu.\nI don't have any files of the right quality to test it on but it's worth a try.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install the package gnome-media-profiles, gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse and soundconverter\n\n*Launch the command (ALT+F2) gnome-audio-profiles-properties and create a new profile called AAC192.

I've noticed that there's a significant delay between when the changes are scheduled to take place in the XML file and when they actually show up on the background.  I've also noticed that when I resume from suspend I don't get the correct background image either. I've found that cycling the wallpaper manually will fix this, and I've written a script to automate the process. \nIf I execute the script manually it works fine.  However, when I schedule the script to run in cron, cron doesn't change the background.  To make sure that the script was being run properly by cron, I had it create a directory in my home folder after running the background change, and the directory is created successfully, so I know cron is running and executing the script.\nMy script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsleep 5\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri\nfile:///home/zak/Pictures/Wallpaper/DOU2.xml\nsleep 1\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \nfile:///home/zak/Pictures/Wallpaper/DOU.xml\nsleep 1\nmkdir /home/zak/iscronworking\n\nexit\n\nIs cron just not able to access gsettings?  The job is on my user crontab so it shouldn't be running as root.\n\nA: This is happen because cron uses only a very restricted set of environment variables. The only one environment variable that is responsible for running in the right way the script from the question when this is set as a cron job is DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, not DISPLAY or GSETTINGS_BACKEND or something else.\nSo, you must to export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable in your script. See more explanations in my answer here.\nIn the end, your script should look like:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPID=$(pgrep gnome-session)\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$PID/environ|cut -d= -f2-)\n\nsleep 5\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/zak/Pictures/Wallpaper/DOU2.xml\nsleep 1\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/zak/Pictures/Wallpaper/DOU.xml\n\n\nA: Apparently gsettings needs some variables to be set. Because CRON uses only a very restricted set of environment variables you must set them before your script. Use the following code in your CRON line.\n30 */2 * * * DISPLAY=:0 GSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf /your/path/your-script.sh\n\nIn the example the job is set to run every 2 hours on the 30th minute. I've tried to insert the variables into the script, for a cleaner line, with no result, if someone find a way to do that, let us know.\nStumbled with these settings in ArchLinux forums.\nThe above solution no longer works with Vivid. \nThe best way to get this to work is indeed to find DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS variable, in the following script I'm using a for loop to do the job because using pidof of a specific application like gnome-session doesn't always work for me and the newers applications have a different DBUS ADDRESS probably because, in my particular case, I'm starting some daemons on boot with my user name. To effectively change the wallpaper I'm using dconf but you can also use gsettings. So tweak the script to your use case.\n#!/bin/bash -e\nuser=$(whoami)\n\nfl=$(find /proc -maxdepth 2 -user $user -name environ -print -quit)\nwhile [ -z $(grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS \"$fl\" | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '\\000' ) ]\ndo\n  fl=$(find /proc -maxdepth 2 -user $user -name environ -newer \"$fl\" -print -quit)\ndone\n\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS \"$fl\" | cut -d= -f2-)\n\nif [ $# -gt 0 ]\nthen\n  PICS_PATH=$1\nelse\n  PICS_PATH=\"/home/public/Pictures/Wallpaper/\"\nfi\n\nIMG=$(find -L $PICS_PATH -name \"*.jpg\" -o -name \"*.png\" | shuf -n1)\n#gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file://${IMG}\"\ndconf write \"/org/gnome/desktop/background/picture-uri\" \"'file://${IMG}'\"\n\necho -e \"$(date): ${IMG}\" >> /tmp/wallch.log\n\nin crontab add the following line to change wallpaper every even hour\n0 */2 * * * /path/to-above-script.sh /path/to-wallpapers/\n\n\nA: I started having the same problem about a month ago. I have also created a script which uses gsettings to change the desktop background in Gnome Shell/Unity.\nManually running this command immediately updates the desktop background. I also use cron to schedule execution of my script:\n0,30 * * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 nextwall /home/serrano/Pictures/backgrounds/\n\nAs in your case, cron successfully runs the script and the new wallpaper URI is successfully set in gsettings. You can test this by running:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri\n\nHowever, the desktop background is not updated when cron runs the script (this used to work until about a month ago). Interestingly, when I right click on my desktop and select \"Change Desktop Background\", the desktop background is suddenly updated to the correct image.\nSo for some reason changing the desktop background from cron no longer triggers Nautilus to update the desktop background.

In the past I routinely backed up my entire unencrypted /home folder with LuckyBackup (gui for Rsync) to an external HDD.

Attached are two screenshots showing the difference between rendering in Firefox and Chrome.\nThe anti-aliasing settings are the same as they've always been, which have worked just fine - full hinting, RGB sub-pixel order.\nI'm really not sure what's going on and am thinking that it might be faster to fix this problem by re-installing, but is there anything I can try first as re-installing is the last thing I want to do?\nI'm running Xubuntu 12.04.\n\n\n\nA: Rename or delete file \".fonts.conf\" in your home directory (switch on \"display hidden files\" to find it), log off and log on again. \nThis helped me (with ubuntu 12.10).\n\nA: I fixed the font rendering on my system after reading this topic. Removing/renaming the home (profile) directory and starting over didn't make any difference.\nYou need to open the xfce4-settings editor and set the /Xft/Lcdfilter string in the xsettings channel from lcdnone to lcdlight.

I have had an issue where it wouldn't show up for network users unless you did that. I'm not sure if it will work when your home folders are encrypted though...\n\nA: With user's encrypted home there is the issue that the home folder is only mounted after login, that means that the Unity greeter cannot read the files inside it so no matter what desktop background you select for a user with an encrypted home folder it will fail to display in the login screen.\nThe location for the user's background is written in the config files inside the user home and if encrypted Unity greeter cannot read that configuration.\nFor the feature to work properly the user's home should not be encrypted.\n\nA: I also have Ubuntu 12.04 (x64) and I encrypted my /home directory.

In fact, it seems rather half-baked.\nObviously there are lots of folks suffering with some sort of problems upgrading, but so far I'm not finding any useful info wading through their threads, either.  This has wasted an inordinate amount of time already, with no sign of my even getting near the scent, much less treeing the varmint.

On a normal startup, the computer boots to a black screen.  If I press F6 on startup and boot from the non recovery, I will get to the user selection screen. But, it by default wants to be in unity 3d so it only takes up the top half of the screen, bottom half is black.  My understanding is that this is because its in Unity 3d not unity 2d.  The file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf reads as follows:\n[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=lightdm-autologin\nuser-session=ubuntu-2d\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nI am not sure what to do next.

Remove the \"system-tray\" and add \"indicator-applets\"\nIf you want a unity look/feel, right-click the panel and customize the settings. Move it to the left, change the width to 35 or 40 pixels and change color to solid opacity with transparency or anything other than the default image. This setup closely resembles the unity look/feel.\n\nA: I have the same problem on my dell mini-10.\nBlack screen on boot....\nLet the PC boot normally... to the black screen..

It used to be that when a program crashed, especially when a user was using a pre-release of Ubuntu, apport could be used to open a bug report.  The user could then track the bug, see if it affected others, help fix it, etc.\nAs of Precise 12.04, this behavior and workflow changed.  As I discovered in Bug #993450 “Apport fails to submit bug report”, by default apport no longer opens a bug report (and it is awkward but not impossible to get it to do so).  At the same time people are noticing a new \"whoopsie\" process, as described at What is the 'whoopsie' process and what does it do?.\nAfter some more googling, I dug this blueprint up, which describes the whole process:\nErrorTracker - Ubuntu Wiki.  (It didn't mention whoopsie or daisy, so I added them - please correct me if I got it wrong).\nWow - this sounds like great work to streamline and improve the crash reporting process.  \nI'm left with this question: how does a user learn what the status of the problem is?\nThe blueprint now has this requirement\n\nThe user should have some way to check back on the status of their crash report; e.g. have some report ID they can look at to see statistics and/or any associated bug #. E.g. provide a serial number at time of filing that they can load via a web page later on.\n\nwhich seems unimplemented.  Is there anything available in the meantime?\nAnd how does a developer get into the game?  Going to https://daisy.ubuntu.com just provides an \"Incorrect Content-Type\" error message.\nFinally, I suggest documenting the apport behavior changes in the Release Notes.  It should be of interest to anyone who has been trying to help out Ubuntu.\n\nA: To view reports from your own system, try this, as documented at\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/+bug/994921/comments/43\nxdg-open https://errors.ubuntu.com/user/`sudo cat /var/lib/whoopsie/whoopsie-id`\n\nWithout special permissions on Launchpad, you can't view the actual reports, but you can see the programs they were reported on, and could use the ids provided to refer to them when talking to developers who do have the proper permissions.\n\nA: Thanks for your interest in the Ubuntu error tracker project.\n\nAs of Precise 12.04, this behavior and workflow changed. As I discovered in Bug #993450 “Apport fails to submit bug report”, by default apport no longer opens a bug report (and it is awkward but not impossible to get it to do so).\n\nApport never created bug reports post-release. When a release is still in development you can use apport to file Launchpad bugs (and error reports).\nIn a final released version of Ubuntu we now show error dialogs. This is a great improvement from a program \"going away\" without any feedback and the user being left wondering what just happened.\nThe statistics from the data collected when people choose to send these reports show up on http://errors.ubuntu.com.\n\nI'm left with this question: how does a user learn what the status of the problem is? The blueprint now has this requirement\n\nThe user should have some way to check back on the status of their crash report; e.g. have some report ID they can look at to see statistics and/or any associated bug #. E.g. provide a serial number at time of filing that they can load via a web page later on.\n\n\nI'm going to remove that. That was never the intent. The user interface is careful not to make promises about getting any feedback on the report.\nThese are not bug reports.\nOur intent is to reduce the amount of time it takes for developers to find the most pressing issues, collect the needed information to fix them, and get the fixes to users.\nWe've solved the problem of finding the most pressing issues. That's the front page of http://errors.ubuntu.com.\nCollecting the needed information quickly, and without involving a long feedback loop with users who are experiencing the problem is addressed in foundations-q-bucketing-improvements. The plan is to allow developers to hook into the information collection process server-side. If I need /var/log/syslog but it's not already provided, I just change a setting on http://errors.ubuntu.com and the next person who experiences the error automatically adds it to the data they're sending.\nGetting fixes to users quickly is addressed in foundations-q-updates-from-crash-reports. When users submit an error report and that error has already been fixed and released, a dialog will come up asking if they would like to upgrade to the version of the software which fixes the problem they just experienced.\n\nAnd how does a developer get into the game? Going to https://daisy.ubuntu.com just provides an \"Incorrect Content-Type\" error message.\n\nhttp://daisy.ubuntu.com is not intended to be used by humans. It's there for the error reporting daemon (whoopsie) to send reports to.\nIt would be absolutely wonderful for other people to get involved. I'm currently the only one hacking on this full-time.\nThere are four parts to the system.\n\n*\n\n*Apport, which provides the desktop user interface.\n\n*Whoopsie, which takes reports (and core dumps) created by Apport and shovels them into the error tracker server, Daisy.\n\n*Daisy, which collects reports from Whoopsie and processes them. This is the heart of the service. It's what turns the core files into retraced reports and generates the statistics you see on http://errors.ubuntu.com.\n\n*Errors, which is a Django-based website providing both a human readable view of the data and a RESTful API for working with it.\n\nThere is a slightly out-of-date set of scripts under the setup/ directory in lp:daisy that should give you some idea of how the pieces fit together. I've been working on juju charms to replace this. The goal is a single command to deploy the entire infrastructure in the cloud for testing and development.\nYou can find my email address on Launchpad if you have further development questions.\nMore info:\n\n*\n\n*What is the 'whoopsie' process and how can I remove it?\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPQ7k0jRUE4#t=30m10s\n\nA: To view the accumulated submitted crash reports you can go to https://errors.ubuntu.com/\n", "Q: How can I see what files have synced and how do you restore lost files?

So you can leave your session (actually whole graphical server) on where it is (probably ctrl+alt+F2) without any touch (for example i3wm by default does not lock its session) and show login screen, which is always on first virtual terminal.\n", "Q: Turn off spellcheck for cyrillic input in Empathy I have spell check enabled for the english keyboard, but when I use serbian cyrillic keyboard, I want that feature turned off, because then all the words get underlined like i spelled them wrong\nHow do I do this?

If so add the line\nPath=/opt/NSTrain/\n\nto your .desktop file. That tells Unity (or Gnome Shell or from whatever program you are using to start your application) to start your program in the given folder. \nWithout that line your application gets started from the current working folder of Unity (or whatever), which usually is your home folder. That will break your application if it assumes it is started from /opt/NSTrain/ and hence tries to open a file like /opt/NSTrain/somefile.dat just as somefile.dat.\nIf that doesn't help please start your application in a Terminal from your home folder using /opt/NSTrain/nstrain.py and post any error messages you get.\n", "Q: Banshee is ignoring id3 tags?

This is also my first attempt at setting up an FTP server. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on a 10 year old desktop that I hope to use as a server for transferring files between myself and my friends who use both Windows and Mac sytems. \nI've vsftpd installed and I think I've configured my /etc/vsftpd.config file to require users to log on (meaning no anonymous users) and have it set up to require SSL (whatever that means, everyone just says to do it to prevent people from sniffing your password since FTP isn't encrypted by itself). However, It would be great if someone could give me a set of layman's instructions on how to configure the server to require a user name and password to access it, since I have no idea if the configuration I have setup right now will work.\nNow comes the part that I really don't understand. How do I now turn vsftpd on and make the server start working? How do I know that it IS on? (The lack of a GUI makes all this very difficult for me.) How do I connect to the server from another computer? Is it possible to use a web browser or do I have to use a program like Filezilla to access the server?\n\nA: You need a few things to get an ftp server to work...\n\n*\n\n\n\n*Configuration - I suggest you read the man pages for the software you are going to use:\nman vsftpd\nman vsftpd.conf\n\n\n*Firewall - outside computers must be allowed to talk to your server: you must allow incoming connections on port 21. Have a look at \"firestarter\" for a nice program to manage that.\n\n*If you want to access the computer from the outside world you may need to tell your router to pass incoming connection on port 21 on to your server as well. Look into the configuration of the router, usually a local address like 192.168.1.254 (on my router).\n\n*vsftp is started for you when you install it, but you can use the program \"bum\" to manage services, or stop/start it from the command line like so:\nsudo service vsftpd stop\nsudo service vsftpd start\n\n\n*After this you should be able to connect to your server from an ftp client or use a web browser: ftp://yourserver/\nHope that helps :)\n\nA: You can use SFTP over SSH.\nJust connect to your home IP address on port 22 with your Ubuntu username and password. You only need to install SSH:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nAlternatively, you can look into webmin.\n", "Q: Virtualbox guests no longer getting shortcuts? I've been using Virtualbox with Ubuntu for a few years now, and I've noticed a change in behavior of keyboard shortcuts sometime recently, possibly after a new version update: in the past, when the guest had the keyboard focus, I was unable to use most of the host's keyboard shortcuts, such as switching virtual desktops; I had to either click on the host desktop, if I could, or, I later found, I could use AWN (in the auto-hide mode) to make use of its desktop switcher applet.\nHowever...  now I can no longer get the guest keyboard shortcuts to work at all.  None of them will work any longer, even with the same VMs I've always used.  \nI haven't found any settings for this, which would be ideal, as I can see some situations where this would be a feature, but overall, I'd like them to work like they did previously, where I was able to do things like switch virtual desktops or run a terminal with a hotkey.\n\nA: I just discovered something I've been missing - the \"Preferences\" menu item.  I've gone through the settings for the individual VMs many times, but didn't notice that there was a separate \"Preferences\" menu for some reason.  I opened this, and lo and behold, there was a checkbox under \"Input\" (where the host key is set, another thing I was wondering about) called \"Auto Capture Keyboard\".  This was unchecked, for some reason, and checking this made it behave like it did previously.\nIt would be nice if this were set per VM, but the good news is that it can be changed while the VM is running, and takes effect immediately.

I accidentally changed my initial account from admin to a standard user and I do not have admin privileges anymore.\nHow can I recover from this. Please explain this in very basic terms for me. I tried some of the answers given but none of them helped me.\n\nA: Following up on the comments above:\nBecause the admin group doesn't exist on your system we are assuming you are running 12.04. To be able to administer your system with 12.04 you need your user-id to be in the sudo group. I was able to add a user-id to the sudo group as follows.\nReboot using grub and select an entry for recovery mode.\nSelect the \"root\" option from the Recovery Menu. From the terminal that opens at the very bottom type:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nsudo addgroup your-username sudo\nThen you can resume the boot by holding control and pressing \"d\" and select resume from the Recovery Menu.\nAs explanation, in recovery mode you come up with the root filesystem in read-only \"error mode\". The first command makes the file system writeable. The second command adds your-username to the sudo group.\nWhen you continue the boot, or somehow reboot, your user-id will be able to use the sudo command as normal. Once you have sudo privileges you can add another administrative user and see what groups they are in, and then you can add your account to those groups, too.\n", "Q: dpkg dependencies for a custom Ubuntu CD Recently I have been working on some projects where I need to add extra packages to default Ubuntu install CDs.  \nI have managed to add these packages successfully and make their icons show up on the unity sidebar after the user finishes installing off the CD.\nHowever, when adding these new packages, I have found that sorting out their dependencies has been painful.  If a new package has dependencies A, B, C and D, and everything except D is included on the on-CD repositories, the installer wizard will error-out unless D is included on the CD, even if the internet is connected (please correct me if my analogy is wrong).\nIn this case, adding D is easy.  But sometimes debian packages have dozens upon dozens of dependencies, and figuring out whether they are included on the CD by hand is cumbersome and time consuming.  Sometimes I accidentally miss a dependency and only find out later when the installer CD errors out.\nI'm thinking there has to be an easier way to do this.  Does anybody have any ideas?\nAndrew\n\nA: apt-cache depends --recurse <pkg> will show all dependencies (with dependencies of dependencies, dependencies of dependencies of dependencies, etc). Then you may download them all and put to your CD.\n\nA: uck Use uck to add extra packages in the live cd .

It's not that they fail often, or that they fill up /boot, but because if you get an update that is incompatible with your hardware you won't know it until your system won't boot. If you are like me you may not remember, days or weeks later, e-mail or not, that the cause might be a new kernel.

I have a large folder of .m4b audio books which in their current format won't play on my Android phone. However they do work fine if they are renamed to .m4a \nIs there a quick method or terminal command that can rename every .m4b file in a folder to .m4a? There is no need for any conversion of the files, simply renaming the file extension works perfectly fine.\n\nA: This will do the job for you.\nrename 's/.m4b$/.m4a/' *.m4b\nFor a test run you can use this command:\nrename 's/.m4b$/.m4a/' *.m4b -vn\n-v means \"verbose\" and it will output the names of the files when it renames them.\n-n will do a test run where it won't rename any files, But will show you a list of files that would be renamed.\n\nA: A very quick way to rename files, if that is all you need to do, and do not need to convert them to another format, is to use Bash's parameter expansions, which are detailed very nicely at the Bash wiki. \nThere are several different ways of changing the extension, but I use here the simple ${var/original/replacement} paradigm:\nfor file in *.m4b; do mv -- \"${file}\" \"${file/%m4b/m4a}\"; done\n\nIf you want to see what would be changed by the command, place echo before mv and the changes will be listed.\nNeedless to say this oneliner could be modified for other files too, and you can also use parameter expansions to remove file extensions too.\n", "Q: How to make Glade load translations from /opt I've created an application that I'd like to submit through the Ubuntu app developer process. One of the requirements for the process is that when installed, all files go into the /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/<appname> directory.\nThrough changes in packaging and with help from others I've achieved that, but now I'm facing a new problem: when running from /opt the translations from my app are not being loaded.\nWhat happens is the following: unless specified otherwise, the binary files (MO files) containing translations for an application are loaded from /usr/share/locale (or in the case of Ubuntu, from /usr/share/locale-langpack), but in my app, due to the /opt requirement, they are installed in /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/qreator/locale.\nThat's in theory fine, as gettext allows specifying an alternative location to load translations, so I add the bindtextdomain call to achieve that:\nimport gettext\nfrom gettext import gettext as _\ngettext.bindtextdomain('qreator', '/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/qreator/share/locale/')\ngettext.textdomain('qreator')\n\nThat works well up to a point: all messages that are output on the command line then appear translated as expected. But it does not solve the main problem: to load the translations from the UI Glade requires specifying the translation domain once more (the equivalent to the gettext.textdomain('qreator') call above), but it does not let specifying where to load translations from (i.e. the Glade equivalent to bindtextdomain, which sadly does not exist). Here's an extract of the code that I'm using:\nbuilder = Gtk.Builder()\nbuilder.set_translation_domain('qreator')\n# There isn't a way to tell glade to load translations from\n# somewhere else than /usr/share/locale here\nbuilder.add_from_file(ui_filename)\n\nThis essentially means that translations from the UI cannot be loaded if your app is installed in /opt.\nI'm pretty much stuck at this point. Any ideas on how to make Glade load translations from /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/qreator/share/locale/ instead of /usr/share/locale?\n\nA: I've found a solution: use the locale Python module instead of gettext \nimport locale\nfrom locale import gettext as _\nlocale.bindtextdomain('qreator', '/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/qreator/share/locale/')\nlocale.textdomain('qreator')\n\nThanks to Juha Sahakangas on the #gtk+ IRC channel for providing the explanation:\n\nFor this particular case the locale module needs to be used\n  instead of gettext. Python's gettext module is pure python, it\n  doesn't actually set the text domain in a way that the C library can\n  read, but locale does (by calling libc). So long as that's done,\n  GtkBuilder already works the way you're asking it to.\n\n", "Q: Nvidia drivers not working on Toshiba AC100 I had ubuntu 11.10 working well on this netbook, but I decided to upgrade to the latest release.

How can i do increase downloading speed ?\n\nA: uGET uses curl and aria2 plugins to maximize speed with multiple connections. As far as I can tell, it provides the highest speeds, never reached by other downloaders, except the non-free Flareget.

It uses some memory but not too much (see the java line in the conky to the right):\n\nIt is set to start by default with the system but that cannot be disabled from within the program; so you need to disable that at system level if you want.\n\nAxel is a CLI program, my favorite at some point (now, it oddly seems unable to capture youtube videos, maybe due to a change in the way Youtube operates and to Axel not keepeing the pace with that). It will download each file from multiple servers (if available), thus increasing significantly the download speed.\nsudo apt-get install axel \n\nInstall FlashGot addon in Firefox\nSet Axel in Flashgot options as the main downloader or just for capturing media.\n\n\nFlareget deserves to be mentioned, although the number of connections per file vary between 4 and 16 depending on the version and license. Even the minimum number of connections will significantly increase speed, but the latest versions will limit (after a trial period) to just two connections any download above 25 MB. It seems to have a smaller memory footprint.\n\n\nFlashGot addon for Firefox is a very good way of redirecting the browser downloads towards external downloaders like those mentioned.\n", "Q: How to test if package is installed? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I check if a package is installed (no superuser privileges) \n\nI want a shell script method to test/report if a package is installed.

As for the FTP, you just include the user credentials in the login, as for SSH, like so:\nuser = user\ndomain.com = domain\nnormally, to visit the site you would enter www.domain.com to visit it. However, to SSH properly you must include the user. This may be your problem. Try this:\nuser@domain.com\ninstead of ssh domain.com and then logging in that way. \n", "Q: PCI SATA controller recommendation I want to add a couple of SATA drives using a PCI SATA controller. Do you have any recommendations for me that will work with 12.04?\n\nA: First let start by saying that SATA PCI cards are hard to come by.  But take a look at this card here.\nIt states that it has Red Hat Linux, SuSE Linux, Linux open source code.  I can not find out if it has been tested with 12.04, but this site here has tested the cart with 7.04.\nI know this may not be the answer that you are looking for, but I could not find any other information or cards :).\nI asked some of the guys that I work with, and I was told that if the card works with 7.04, that it should work with 12.04. but there is no way for me to verify that, I hope that you understand\n", "Q: Can't turn on or enable wireless I'm using ubuntu 11.10 for a couple of months.\nbut Today after restart my laptop I can't get wireless on.

If you go into the power options in your windows, go to advanced options and find where the option to 'set what the power button does', disable the 'fast start' and reboot into linux. If the 'fast start' is enabled in your windows, windows keeps control of your wifi card.

I know how to set it, but why doesn't Ubuntu set it automatically, like with the other LC_'s?\n\nA: If LC_ALL is set it overrides the values of all the other LC_ variables. Hence setting it by default would have the same effect for your locale settings as setting all the LC variables but would make it more difficult to change only some of the values.\n", "Q: How can Audacity help me determine vocal range and voice type? Is there a way to use Audacity to record someone sing a song and then have a look at what musical notes a person has hit?\nHere is a list of what type of singers exist:\nSoprano: C4 – C6\nMezzo-soprano: A3 – A5\nContralto: F3 – F5\nTenor: C3 – C5\nBaritone: F2 – F4\nBass: E2 – E4\nThis is why I'd like to use Audacity to tell me what notes the person hit...so that I could determine what type of singer a person is, but I really don't know if there is an application that analyzes singing in terms of notes.\n\nA: Audacity has a pitch view.  This screenshot is a little buggy, but you should be able to see that you click on the \"Audio Track\" menu then the \"Pitch (EAC)\" option.\n\nThat's my technical answer.\nHowever, as a musician, I would say that this is a very inefficient and probably ineffective way to determine someone's range.  I can croak out a low D that software might register as on pitch.  Likewise I can sing notes in an alto's range but their timber and mine will be completely different (I'm a tenor).  Likewise their dynamics at different areas of their vocal ranges will be completely different.\nI would highly recommend using a piano or any other musical instrument (heck you could even have the computer generate tones if you don't have access to an instrument) to check pitch (or provide pitches for the vocalist to match) and then use your own ear to make a subjective judgement about the vocalist's range.\n\nA: I haven't tried this myself, but in theory it might work. Record the audio, and choose Analyze > Plot Spectrum ... and look at the graph to determine peaks. Mouse will snap to the peaks, so you can hover over them and see their frequencies (and corresponding notes) below the chart.\nIf your recordings have instrumentals, you can select only a part of the recording before analysis. If your recording is very long (many minutes), audacity will automatically select only a portion in the beginning.\n\nA: Although my musical education is close to zero, this is how I see it:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Use one microphone and a MIDI INSTRUMENT.\nCaution! MIDI instrument is a different thing from a MIDI Controller!  \n\n*Connect both the mic and the MIDI Instrument to your audio interface, like this  \n\n\n*\n\n*The mic, to one channel\n\n*The Audio Out MIDI keyboard, to the other channel\n\n\n*Start Audacity. Select the appropriate audio interface, and set the default  recording to \"Stereo\". This is how you'll get two synchronous DIFFERENT tracks, one for voice, the other for (piano or whatever instrument you find suitable) notes. Start the \"Record\" mode.  \n\n*Play a sequence of chords (progression?) and record the voice following the chords, as close as possible. \n\n*Analysis. There is a different approach, according to skills and equipment:\nEither you use your ear to compare the smoothness of the voice following the chords, OR you use the MIDI keyboard to record the performance on the internal MIDI recorder.\nFor the MIDI sequence, you can find free software to print the notes of the performance. After this, you can follow the exact path as the specialist would do to determine voice range, tonic and whatever you might need for your final purpose (voice breaks, upper register, lower register)\n\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 cannot login I am using Ubuntu 12.04.

Should I install this? And if not, why do I get the offer?\n\nA: Check whether your OS is with PAE extension.\n\nA 32-bit computer has a word size of 32 bits, this limits the memory\n  theoretically to 4GB. This barrier has been extended through the use\n  of 'Physical Address Extension' (or PAE) which increases the limit to\n  64GB although the memory access above 4GB will be slightly slower.\n\nMost dekstop/laptop processor made in past 10 year support PAE.\nSince Ubuntu 10.04 and newer support PAE out of the box so it can access 64 address line.In 12.04 its default.\nProbably that's why you got that kernel image.  64bit means its capable of 64bit address handling, the kernel image architecture is x86 which points that it is for 32bit system.\nUnless you have modified your kernel or using the kernel for system software development,its safe to install kernels provide via update-manager.\n", "Q: How do I use a gamepad? I'm planning on buying a game-pad for playing games on emulators (like ZSNES) and I have read a few articles on the net related to some game-pads not working in Linux especially when playing games via Wine. But that only for Wine, right? There are some questions in my mind, like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does that mean that all native Ubuntu games work fine with any game-pads OR this too has specific game-pads? that work on Ubuntu(12.04).\n\n*What if I buy a random game-pad say Unofficial/Fake, will it be recognize it as a game-pad or will Ubuntu ignore it? \n\n*If it gets recognized how will I/it find the appropriate drivers required for using the hardware? OR will drivers not be necessary and I can start playing, right after I bought it and plugged it in?\n\nA: Generally speaking, all USB gamepads that follow the HID spec work in Linux without a need for special drivers, which means pretty much all normal PC gamepads will work. Support might however be limited to basic features and things like rumble might not be supported. \nConsole gamepads like the Xbox360 gamepad, Wiimote or Dualshock will work in Linux as well, but require some additional work (i.e. drivers such as qtsixa, cwiid, xpad or xboxdrv).\n\nA: Try atimicro app which for me was the best!\nhttps://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro\n\n\nA: All gamepads/joysticks (5 or so) I have tried so far did work. For configuration install qjoypad or jstest-gtk. Qjoypad worked better if I remember correctly.\n\nA: Even though turbo has already mentioned qjoypad very briefly, it is worth providing a longer answer, as the very latest (and best) version needs compiling, as it is not in the repositories and there is currently no package available at the site either. Secondly, there are general  older blog guides regarding qjoypad, but it would be useful to have an up-to-date one for Ubuntu.\nIntroduction\nWhat I do with Wine and Dosbox when there are problems with games and controller support (which is most of the time) is to use a program such as qjoypad. This utility \n\nIncorporates your gaming devices into any XWindows program. qjoyPad takes input from a gamepad or joystick and translates it into key strokes or mouse actions, letting you control any XWindows program with your game controller.\n\nso that it doesn't matter whether wine or the actual game within wine supports the joypad, you will generally be able to use it. \nCompilation\nInstall the dependencies (and build-essential if necessary) with:\nsudo apt-get install libxtst6 libxtst-dev libx11-dev checkinstall build-essential\n\nYou will need the QT libraries to run the program, and the QT dev libraries to compile qjoypad, as noted on the official site, so you must also install the entire QT development kit with\nsudo apt-get install libqt4-dev\n\nThis is very important as you are using the QT libraries to build the gui.\nDownload the latest version (currently 4.10) from Sourceforge and then extract it with \ntar xzvf qjoypad-4.1.0.tar.gz\n\nThen cd to that folder and then cd to the src folder and run\n./configure\nmake\nsudo checkinstall --pkgname=qjoypad --pkgversion=4.1.0 --provides=qjoypad\n\nSetup\nNow connect your joystick or gamepad and run from terminal qjoypad & or select it from the launcher menu.\nWhen you load up qjoypad (screenshot one) you will see button numbers such as button 1, button 2, etc. If you wish to see what these correspond to on your joystick you could install evtest and run evtest and then select the device number of your gamepad to get the following information:\nInput device ID: bus 0x3 vendor 0x45e product 0x7 version 0x100\nInput device name: \"Microsoft® Microsoft® SideWinder® Game Pad USB\"\nSupported events:\n  Event type 0 (EV_SYN)\n  Event type 1 (EV_KEY)\n    Event code 304 (BTN_A)\n    Event code 305 (BTN_B)\n    Event code 306 (BTN_C)\n    Event code 307 (BTN_X)\n    Event code 308 (BTN_Y)\n    Event code 309 (BTN_Z)\n    Event code 310 (BTN_TL)\n    Event code 311 (BTN_TR)\n    Event code 312 (BTN_TL2)\n    Event code 313 (BTN_TR2)\n\nThe button order here reflects that in qjoypad, so qjoypad's button 1 is BTN_A on the controller, etc. \n(Your joypad layouts are stored in ~/.qjoypad3 if you want to back them up.)\nThe readme in the download with the source code also has some useful information about setting up and running qjoypad.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click add to create a new profile and name it, and then you can assign all the buttons available, but you must click update to save your settings.\n \n\n*You can fully configure all the axis points, and both sidewinder type and dual analog devices seem to be configurable. More details on this are available in this article and on the useful readme included with the source code download.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nQjoypad needs to be running (with your correct joypad game profile selected) when dosbox or wine is launched.\nYou need to define your keyboard bindings first in the game in which you want to use qjoypad. Very often in your game itself the setting should be set to keyboard and not joystick. This is what I have found with Dosbox games, and it is probably the same for Wine games. Both for gaming and for controlling any program running in an X window, qjoypad is a very useful utility.\n\nA: If you want to try other DEB or APT:\nsearch for qjoypad at http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/\nand remember setup only appear if started from qjoypad --notray and left-click the icon!\n", "Q: Package has unmet dependencies: gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme I followed the instructions from here but I got the following error when trying to install gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme : Depends: gnome-shell-extensions-common but it is not going to be installed\n\nExtra information:\nRunning Ubuntu with Gnome3\n\nA: gnome-shell-extensions-common depends upon gnome-shell-extensions, which already includes the user-theme extension, and so conflicts with the gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme package.

What is nouveau?\n\nA: Nouveau is a attempt to replace the NVIDIA obfuscated driver and put it in the kernel. No modeset tells the kernel, not to attempt to set the screenmode. Nouveau would have to do that. However, my experience with an NVIDIA 690 is that nouveau starts to panic at my card and the boot system hangs. A sign to me, that nouveau is still not mature, because the 690 has been around for a while now.\nAbout the driver: nouveau is a kernel component that you can not deactivate through ' additional drivers / restricted drivers' because these drivers are the ones you use for X windows.\nwhat I did, is I added NOMODESET in the list of kernel parameters in grub, permanently.\nWhen the system boots the kernel checks this setting and reacts accordingly.\nFor Ubuntu 12.04 the setting is stored in /etc/default/grub . You add it to the line titled GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. If the line says:  \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nyou would change it to:  \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\nAfter adding NOMODESET to this line you should run sudo update-grub to allow grub2 to see it the next time you boot.\n\nA: Nouveau is an open source driver for Nvidia graphics. \nnomodeset tells the kernel not to start up whatever graphic kernel driver it plans to use early in the boot process.\nYou say you reinstalled the driver, I assume you mean the Nvidia driver.\nI would guess that, without specifying nomodeset, one kernel module sets up to run your video and then the other driver is loaded when you start X and they fight over who is running your graphics hardware.\nIf you downloaded the driver directly you might be better off taking it back off and installing the Nvidia driver from the Ubuntu restricted repository, if possible.\n", "Q: How can I know whether a sound card is present on my system or not?

The first thing to try when having such kind of issues with grub2 is to purge its packages and reinstall them. with it's \"plain\" configuration, grub2 is likely to work well.\nHowever, to effectively debug grub2 issues, it's advisable to run it within qemu:\nsync ; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches ; qemu -hda /dev/sdx\nThis make the debug process faster (no need to reboot) and at the same time slows down grub2 allowing to see error messages otherwise too quick to be read at boot.\n", "Q: How should USB stick in Lion for 12.04 be formatted initially? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I get my Mac to boot from an Ubuntu USB key? \n\nTo create an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS USB stick in Mac OS X Lion, how should be the stick formatted initially?\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Ubuntu, lsemac!\nYou don't need to format the USB before recording the USB, just make an USB image and burn the IMG using Disk Utility.

The whole point of this is I identify my graphics card, I go to the download site, I say I have this graphics card, and this operating system and then click search.\nJust start at the top Dropdown menu and keep going down until you've done all of them.\nIf you have a GeForce GTX, the Product Series is GEForce. You'll be able to infer from the name.\nIf you feel like you can't find your graphics card in the dropdown menus, don't give up. If it is a consumer grade NVidia graphics card and it exists, it is in these dropdown menus. Keep looking.\nClick Search button once you've found your card.\nI get this page for the driver that I needed. Yours will be different, because you will likely not have the exact same card as me:\n\nI click the download button. Now I should have a .run file in my ~/Downloads folder.\nYou’ve downloaded the driver, now you have to install some pre-reqs before you can run it.\nsudo apt install gcc\nsudo apt install make\n\nNote: GCC is actually the GNU C Compiler, and make is another program for creating object files from c code. Programmers use these, you don’t have to be a programmer to install these, they are just a pre-req for installing this driver.\nIf you for some reason did not install these before running the driver you will see warnings like this:\n\nError: Unable to find the development tool ‘cc’ in your path; please make sure that you have the package ‘gcc’ installed. If gcc is installed on your system, then please check that ‘cc’ is in your PATH.\nThat one you can’t ignore. I know it’s tempting to just always hit yes to everything when running an installer, but I do recommend reading the prompts in this case. It will tell you if it is missing something it needs. (like above ^^)\n\nThe distribution-provided pre-install script failed! Are you sure you want to continue?\n^^ This one however, I have been able to ignore with no issue. There may be quite a few reasons this script can fail, so results may vary for ignoring this.\nAnyway, next we run the installer:\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nto go to the downloads folder, or wherever you stored the .run file you just downloaded.\nsudo chmod +x nvidia_install_xxx_xxx.run\n\nTo give execute permissions to the file. Instead of my filename here use the name of the .run file you just downloaded. You’re doing this to give run permissions to the file. (You can't just copy paste above, use the file you downloaded)\nsudo ./nvidia_install_xxx_xxx.run\n\nto actually run the executable and install the driver.\nIt’s going to actually run in the terminal and pop up with a bunch of questions. I just said yes to all of them and everything was fine.\nWhen it asks you if you want to overwrite libglvnd you can say yes, that is fine. I have also ignored this, and not noticed anything different. So I am still not even sure what this is for:\n\nWhen it asks you about overwriting x libraries that is fine too:\n\nX is mostly concerned with rendering windows and OS stuff like that. I see no reason why I shouldn’t use my graphics card to render windows. Rendering windows isn’t a terribly heavy operation either, so whether you say yes or no isn’t that important for normal usage.\nIf you’re only concerned with using the NVidia driver with Tensorflow for example, this probably doesn’t matter that much at all.\nTest: You can test to see if your install went correctly right here in the command line by running nvidia-smi:\n$ nvidia-smiTue Aug 13 20:33:54 2019       \n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| NVIDIA-SMI 430.40       Driver Version: 430.40       CUDA Version: 10.1     |\n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

That’s because the driver you installed is using its own Cuda that came packaged with the driver. Don't freak out if it doesn't match the CUDA you are using to develop with.\nIt tells me my driver is installed and the last page of the installer said I need to reboot. I do a reboot and the second monitor just starts working correctly and I don’t even need to do anything.\nI can see the second monitor and configure it in my display settings now too.\n\nNote: sometimes on reboot your second monitor will just not show up anymore and this can be fixed by running the installer again. Keep your .run file in a safe place you can find because you will probably need it again. After some googling, I vaguely recall this has something to do with offloading the kernel or something. Again, all you have to do is reinstall the graphics driver, quick fix.\n\nA: According to /var/log/Xorg.0.log, the second screen was detected at startup. Notably this was a line starting with \"NVIDIA\". To actually enable it, you have to go to the \"NVIDIA X Server Settings\" window. Start it via Dash Home.\n\nA: Similar issue happened to me but the above solutions did not work. Below are the steps that worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the display (HDMI cable) from the machine.\n\n*Reboot the machine.\n\n*Plug-in the second display.\n\n\nNow it should recognize the 2nd display.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my HP Elitebook 8530w, which uses an NVidia Quadra graphics card. I use the recommended NVidia drivers in Ubuntu 12.04.\nIn Applications > System Tools > System Settings > Display it will not detect my secondary display.\nHowever when I go to Applications > System Tools > Administration there is the option Nvidia X Server settings.\nHere I can select another display which is being detected properly and I can immediately use my secondary display.\n\nA: Had a similar issue when connecting another monitor to my laptop.\nTried installing the drivers - didn't help.\nHowever, after these steps:\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak\nreboot\n\nOpen Settings > Displays and click Detect Displays\nOn the same window uncheck the Mirror Displays checkbox\nThe second monitor was detected.\nPlease note, in the first step you could delete the file, but renaming it is safer in case you need to restore it.\n\nA: What worked for me was:\nsudo update-pciids\nlspci -nn |grep 'VGA'\n\n\nA: I managed to solve my problem by:\n\n*\n\n*Disconnecting both monitors\n\n*Reconnecting the one that wasn't working first\n\n*Reconnecting the other one.\n\n\nA: Go to the Dash button (purple and white on the top left) and then type Display. The Display control will show up. Click on it. After a few seconds you should be in the Display control panel and should see both displays. Click on the additional monitor and click on the Enable control.\nThen press the Apply button. If everything looks good you can accept this configuration. If you don't do anything it will go back to how it was after 30 seconds.\nIf you want to use them both at the same time you can also uncheck the Mirror button and can move the screens relative to each other. Again, you must click on the Apply button to try it out. You will then be able to view different parts of a virtual desktop on the two displays and can move windows with your mouse to where they are most handy for you.\n\nA: Solved a similar problem; Ubuntu 18.04, it started acting like there was only one monitor (there are two).\nThe single monitor's image would jiggle every couple of seconds.  Rebooting didn't help.  Then turned the blank monitor off and on, rebooted, and it solved the problem.  Weird.\n\nA: I had to change the PRIME profile in \"NVIDIA X Server Settings\" to Performance mode for Ubuntu 20.04 to pick up a screen again on my laptop:\n\n\nA: I have the Nvidia 540M and I also faced some problems with Nouveau driver, but I figured out a solution quite simply after hours and days of search, when Nvidia finally released there driver on Ubuntu.\nI suggest you to install the latest tested Nvidia Driver (346.96) by using the graphical interface (Drivers > Additional Drivers).\nDo not forget to reboot after a proper installation and ensure that you actually run this driver.\nThen, open NVIDIA X Server settings. On \"Prime profiles\" menu, check \"Nvidia (Performance mode)\".\nYou can finally perform some checks while pluging in in your monitor. It should appear on the Server settings menu, and can be easily configured.\n", "Q: Broken file permissions when using ubuntu as guest system (vmware) I'm using ubuntu as guest system on my vmware and I've got following problem:\nIf I copy files from the host system (windows) into the shared folder sometimes it happens that the file permissions are broken.\n$ ls -l my/path/to/whatever\n\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 user group 4096 Mai 22 11:57 myFolder\n\n-????????? ? ?        ?           ?            ? myImage.png\n\nThe only way to fix that is to remount the shared folder but that's suboptimal\n\nA: I solved it via rebooting VMWare, but yep, it sucks.\n", "Q: VLC does not inhibit screen blanking I have an issue which could be a bug, but before reporting it, I want to make sure I'm not doing something wrong.\nWhen watching a movie with VLC on fullscreen, approximately in 10 minutes the screen goes blank. This happens despite having the \"Inhibit the power management daemon during playback\" option checked. This even happens when I go to the Ubuntu's system settings > Brightness and Lock and set the \"Turn screen off when inactive for: \" to \"Never\". (actually, no matter what value I set it to, the screen always goes blank after 10 minutes or so).\nThe only way I managed to disable the screen blanking is using the command line utility xset: xset -dpms and xset s off (it's possible only one of these is necessary).\nNow, one thing that could possibly cause this is that I removed both gnome-screensaver and xscreensaver packages, because I'm not using screensaver. I only use the power-management to blank the screen (I assume it's different thing than screensaver, but I might be wrong). When no VLC us running, the screen blanking works normally even without those packages. That is, the screen goes blank after whatever timeout I set in the Brightness and Lock settings. Only when VLC is playng (and possibly only when in fullscreen), this issue occurs.\nSo my question is: Is this a bug in VLC (or elsewhere in Ubuntu), or should I install back gnome-screensaver and/or xscreensaver to make it work correctly again?\nI have Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: As an intermediate work-around, try installing Caffeine. Enter the following commands in a terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nThen…\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Caffeine from the Dash, which displays a small icon on the right\nside in your top panel. \n\n*Click it once to display the Preferences. \n\n*Check Start Caffeine on login.\n\n*Use the Add button to add vlc (in lowercase).\n\n\nA: Since VLC should automatically prevent the screen from blanking when playing any video (or should have a working option to do so), regardless of the user's settings outside VLC, this can quite reasonably be considered a bug. Go forth and report it!\nYou can comment with the URL of the bug report on Launchpad, so that other people (like me) who have experienced this problem can easily access, subscribe to, and (using the green \"This bug affects...\" link) indicate we are affected (which will automatically make the bug Confirmed and bring it closer to a Triaged state, so it can be worked on by developers).\n", "Q: I cannot download anything ie. msn or pokerstarsAny ideas? When I try to download anything it says;\n\nAn error occurred when loading the archive \nArchive: /tmp/wlsetup-web-2.exe [/tmp/wlsetup-web-2.exe]\n  End-of-central-directory signature not found. \nEither this file is not a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a\n  multi-part archive.

You should be able to find there some applications suiting your needs, or maybe they are already installed on your system. For example, the instant messenger client Empathy, which is included in ubuntu install, is able to communicate over MSN / WLM protocols without any problem.\nIf you really want to use windows applications, you should download the windows emulator Wine (through Software center !) and then choose Wine as default application to open windows executables. But this option isn't encouraged except for specific software who don't have any open equivalent, because you would then face the same issues as the ones you may have with windows : the need to be careful about virus, the need to solve dependencies by hand, the frequent compatibility issues or clashes...\n\nA: Welcome to Ubuntu!\nAs others have said, Ubuntu is not Windows and their software is not compatible. You will need to install Ubuntu/Linux specific software. You can browse the Ubuntu Software Center for most all software you would ever want or need. It is similar to an app store, like for Android or iPhones, except that it is almost all free! Not all software is cross-platform (meaning they have versions for Linux/Windows/Mac), so you may have to use an alternative for some of your favorite programs. To use MSN, Ubuntu comes with a built-in instant messenger client called Empathy.\nIf you are having issues finding the software you need, here is a great site to find alternative native Linux software: http://alternativeto.net/software/?platform=linux\nThere is no native PokerStars client for Ubuntu, but as others have said, you can run it through Wine. Here is some more information on how to get it installed with Wine: http://www.thepokerbank.com/rooms/pokerstars/ubuntu/ Although Wine is a great piece of software and allows you to run some Windows native applications on Ubuntu, it should always be treated as  a last resort. Some programs may not run well or have too many Windows dependencies.\n", "Q: Upgraded server to 12.04 DNS no longer working I cannot ping/reach any website/service by name (e.g. ping google.com).\nI could temporarily fix this by changing 127.0.0.1 to my router in /etc/resolv.conf\nBut that file gets overwritten.\nHow can I permanently fix this?\nTo be clear, I don't need a DNS server, I just want my server to be able to use DNS from DHCP.\n\nA:                                         Setup Static DNS Servers in Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin)\nsudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf\n\nThen change the line highlighted to\nprepend domain-name-servers x.x.x.x, y.y.y.y;\n\n\nliberiangeek\n\nUbuntu 12.04 changes the way DNS setup is handled. Rather than adding nameservers to /etc/resolv.conf, they need to be added to /etc/network/interfaces.\nEdit /etc/network/interfaces, look for your primary ethernet device (such as eth0), and add this line under your primary ethernet device:\ndns-nameservers 127.0.0.1\n\nAnd then restart your networking:\n/etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nvirtualmin\n\nA: I solved it in another way, because I have the impression the solution above is doing what was not asked, i.e. implementing a dhcp server.\nI deleted the bind9 and dhcp3-server with \nsudo aptitude remove bind9 dhcp3-server\n\nand restarted networking with\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nI also changed the file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf.

I am using pbuilder-dist to build my packages for Debian unstable and Ubuntu Precise. I want to know how to run lintian (and possibly other commands) inside a certain chroot.\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 on my machine.\n\nA: Lintian can be run inside cowbuilder or pbuilder using hooks.\nSeveral examples are available in /usr/share/doc/pbuilder/examples/\nJust copy the hook you want to a directory:\nmkdir ~/pbuilderhooks\ncp /usr/share/doc/pbuilder/examples/B90lintian $HOME/pbuilderhooks\n\nThen tell pbuilder to use the hooks in that directory:\necho \"HOOKDIR=$HOME/pbuilderhooks/\" >> ~/.pbuilderrc\n\nAnd/or:\necho \"HOOKDIR=$HOME/pbuilderhooks/\" | sudo tee -a /etc/pbuilderrc\n\nThe first  is required if you intend to run cowbuilder-dist or pbuilder-dist without sudo; the latter if you intend to run sudo cowbuilder or sudo pbuilder.  Use tee -a to avoid overwriting the original /etc/pbuilderrc file.\n\nA: Running debuild -S will run lintian on the source.changes for you I believe.  Lintian is also run on the .changes file during the binary build.  Once you've built the binary and/or source package you can manually run lintian against either .changes file, just like this:\nmfisch@caprica:~$ lintian libkqueue_1.0.4-2ubuntu1_amd64.changes\n\nor\nmfisch@caprica:~$ lintian libkqueue_1.0.4-2ubuntu1_source.changes\n\nYou may get different lintian errors or warnings from each build (source and binary).\nIf you're trying to move quicker, run pbuilder --login, install the build-deps and run your builds there, that saves you the start-up time from re-installing deps before each build.\n", "Q: How to Install Ubuntu in windows 7 Partition?

How can I make this work?\n\nA: Ubuntu and related (Unix/Linux/BSD) systems don't typically designate applications with the .exe extensions.   (They can be interpreted by the system according to file associations, MIME types, format of the file, and so on.)\nExecutable files (that is, applications) are usually found in bin directories.  (There are other questions and references that go into detail on the where and why.)\nThere are some handy commands to find these files, but in many cases, the system already knows where there are -- if you can execute google-chrome manually, it is probably already in a place (path) that Ubuntu knows about, so just adding the name of the application (google-chrome) in something like the startup menu is sufficient. \n\nA: Welcome to Ask Ubuntu!\nSo... you're really new to Ubuntu! I should say you two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't worry about finding EXEs, they don't exist.\n\n*Even without EXEs, you're still able to autostart an app when logging in.\n\n\nIf you want to autostart Chrome when logging in, follow this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Dash, and open Startup Application Preferences.

I will close the question here. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10704889/java-execute-command-line-program-find-returns-error\n\nA: The \\ in -exec md6sum {} \\; is necessary to prevent the shell from interpreting the ; character as command separator. If Java does not execute the command in a shell, try removing the escaping \\\\ so that the code becomes:\nRuntime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();\nProcess pr = rt.exec(\"find testDir -type f -exec md5sum {} ;\");\n\nI have just confirmed this behavior with the next test program:\nimport java.io.*;\nclass Xx {\n    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {\n        Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"/bin/echo \\\\;\");\n        InputStream in = p.getInputStream();\n        int c;\n        while ((c=in.read()) != -1)\n            System.out.write((char)c);\n        p.waitFor();\n    }\n}\n\nCompiled with javac Xx.java, java Xx outputs \\;. If I remove the \\\\, it'll print ; as expected.\n\nA: Different shells sometimes require different characters to be escaped, so depending on what shell you are using in your terminal and what shell you are using for your script (you say bash, but are you sure?), you can get different results. Zsh, for example, will require you to escape the {} too:\nfind testDir -type f -exec md5sum \\{\\} \\;\n\nFrom Java, you could try removing all the backslashes or changing your second line to:\nProcess pr = rt.exec(\"find testDir -type f -exec md5sum \\\\{\\\\} \\\\;\");\n\n", "Q: Fragments with recordmydesktop I tried to record an Screencast wih gtk-recordmydesktop.

I welcome any kind of help/direction.\n\nA: Boot your machine from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or live USB stick (like you would use to install Ubuntu). Select Try Ubuntu (not Install Ubuntu). Run the GParted Partition Editor (you can search for gparted in the dash).\nShrink down your 581 GB partition (/dev/sda6) to make room to the left. Shrink it by however much space you want to add to the /boot partition--in this case, by about 408 MB. (You may have to shrink it, then move it to the right.)\nThen expand the /dev/sda1 partition to take up the newly available unpartitioned space.\nApply your changes by clicking the green check mark.\nQuit GParted and reboot back into the Ubuntu system installed on your hard disk. Now your /boot partition is about 500 MB in size, and your / partition is shrunk by about 408 MB to make room for it.\nFinally, please note that you should not attempt to change the sizes of partitions on the system drive from the installed Ubuntu system. At best GParted will refuse to operate and at worst you can severely mess up your Ubuntu system and even have data loss. This is why you need to boot from a live CD to perform these operations. That is relatively safe, but whenever you dynamically resize partitions there's a small risk of data loss (either if the operation fails or if you make a mistake), so you should make sure all your backups of your documents and other important (i.e., irreplaceable, or tough to replace) files in your Ubuntu system are current before you perform the above procedure.\n", "Q: Should I use PyQt or PySide for a new Qt project? Recently I've been involved in conversations about creating a Quickly template for a Qt and QtQuick Ubuntu app. The idea is to make it as easy to develop Qt apps from concept to package as it is right now with GTK, on which the Ubuntu application Quickly template is based.\nThe intention is still to use Python as the base programming language, and the first question that comes to mind is: which Python bindings should we use PyQt or PySide?\nI'd like to hear from the folks experienced in both technologies what the pros and cons of each one are, how well maintaned each one is, how well mapped the Qt API is to the bindings, etc.\nThanks!\n\nA: Both PyQt4 and PySide have very similar mappings to the Qt API.  There are, however, some differences, my opinions on which are described below:\nMaintenance\nThey are both well maintained.  The PySide produces a lot more regular releases at the moment: I think it's more closely linked to Qt than PyQt4 and as a newer project has a more active community at the moment.  However, that is just my impression and it may be wrong.\nPyQt4 has the option of commercial support available (I don't know whether this is true for PySide or not).\nLicence\nPyQt4 is released under either a commercial licence or the GPL; PySide is released under the LGPL.  For commercial applications, this is a significant difference.\nAPIs and Python versions\nPyQt4 supports two different APIs.  API version 1 is the default for python 2.x applications and API version 2 is the default for python 3.x applications.\nPySide only supports one API, which is roughly equivalent to PyQt4's API version 2.  API version 2 (or the PySide API) is much nicer to work with than PyQt4's API version 1.  In API version 1 you have a lot of code that casts python strings to QtCore.QStrings and back again.  In API version 2 (and PySide) you just use python strings throughout.  See below for a simple way of switching between PyQt4 and PySide if you want to play with both.\nMost code I write seems to work equally well in PyQt4 and PySide.  Historically, I had always used PyQt4 for python GUIs but most new stuff I write now uses PySide (mainly due to the more flexible licensing).  I'd certainly recommend you try both and see how you find them.  If you use QtVariant.py (below), switching between them is trivial and when you make a decision there will only be one file that needs updating.\nDocumentation\nThe documentation for both PyQt4 and PySide are auto-generated from the main Qt documentation.  In my opinion, the PySide documentation is a better representation of what you actually use, but in practice I tend to just use the Qt documentation anyway (it's quite easy to mentally translate the C++ documentation to python).\nExternal Libraries\nIf you're using external libraries, some do not work with PySide yet.  There aren't many that you need to work with PySide to be honest, but a couple of years ago I wrote some code that used twisted (with the Qt reactor) and matplotlib and that forced me down the line of using PyQt4 rather than PySide.  I think it's quite likely that these libraries will have been updated to support both by now, but I haven't checked.\nMaking Code work with either PyQt4 or PySide\nAssuming you're using python 2.x, you can fairly easily make your code compatible with both PySide and PyQt4 by making a QtVariant.py and using:\nfrom QtVariant import QtGui, QtCore\n\nor whatever.  The QtVariant.py that I use looks like this:\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndefault_variant = 'PySide'\n\nenv_api = os.environ.get('QT_API', 'pyqt')\nif '--pyside' in sys.argv:\n    variant = 'PySide'\nelif '--pyqt4' in sys.argv:\n    variant = 'PyQt4'\nelif env_api == 'pyside':\n    variant = 'PySide'\nelif env_api == 'pyqt':\n    variant = 'PyQt4'\nelse:\n    variant = default_variant\n\nif variant == 'PySide':\n    from PySide import QtGui, QtCore\n    # This will be passed on to new versions of matplotlib\n    os.environ['QT_API'] = 'pyside'\n    def QtLoadUI(uifile):\n        from PySide import QtUiTools\n        loader = QtUiTools.QUiLoader()\n        uif = QtCore.QFile(uifile)\n        uif.open(QtCore.QFile.ReadOnly)\n        result = loader.load(uif)\n        uif.close()\n        return result\nelif variant == 'PyQt4':\n    import sip\n    api2_classes = [\n            'QData', 'QDateTime', 'QString', 'QTextStream',\n            'QTime', 'QUrl', 'QVariant',\n            ]\n    for cl in api2_classes:\n        sip.setapi(cl, 2)\n    from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore\n    QtCore.Signal = QtCore.pyqtSignal\n    QtCore.QString = str\n    os.environ['QT_API'] = 'pyqt'\n    def QtLoadUI(uifile):\n        from PyQt4 import uic\n        return uic.loadUi(uifile)\nelse:\n    raise ImportError(\"Python Variant not specified\")\n\n__all__ = [QtGui, QtCore, QtLoadUI, variant]\n\n", "Q: How do I change the desktop name on the Unity panel? \nHow do I change my desktop name from Ubuntu Desktop to XYZ's Desktop via the Unity panel?\n\nA: There's a much quicker way than doug's method, by abusing the gettext translation system.

Even if the package only changes in a few lines. What I mean is, for a 4MB package that has only for example 2KB lines changed, Update Manager downloads the whole 4MB. With my connection this is horrible since it takes very long (Remember I download between 10KB to 50KB most of the time). Since there are several big packages, we could be talking between 2KB changes separated in 100MB of packages that I would have to download from scratch even though I had already downloaded them 24 hours ago for example.\nSo why does a Cache Manager need to download the complete package again when all that has changed is one small part. More importantly, is there a way that I can tell it to verify the source package to see what has changed and securely download only the modified part?\nI will add that this is apt-get, aptitude and synaptic also. All of them work the same way and when a 50 line of the package changes, I have to download the whole thing. Is there a more efficient way of updating, a configuration, a parameter?\n\nA: I'm afraid this isn't a feature of a Debian-based system. STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED is correct about integrity checking. gpg keys are stored for repositories. Release files are stored in repositories and are signed. Those release files contain checksums for the various Package files, which contain lists of packages. Each package description contains checksums for each component as a whole.\nDebian has done work to reduce the bandwidth required for apt-get by using package diffs, but they don't seem to reduce the bandwidth required to do an apt-get upgrade, only apt-get update (not the packages themselves, only the Package files). I've been told that Ubuntu doesn't support this. For a description see http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/439\nYou may be interested in the Exherbo or Funtoo. See https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/36357/git-based-package-manager-installer-for-linux. Git wasn't around when the debian project was created.

However, Compiz was still forgetting the settings. \"UnityShell\" keeps getting to the end of the list after every reboot and messing up scale and expo. \nI was able to solve the issue by locking the positions of the keys. You can do this using CCSM. \nOpen CCSM (CompizConfig) and click on preference and then Plugin List. Uncheck \"Automatic Plugin Sorting.\" Ensure that Scale is the last entry and expo just above that. If you are using Scale addon, make sure it goes below scale.\nNow restart the computer and Scale and Expo will load.

So you can download it, untar it, compile the software and install it.\nHowever, what deb packages do is to make this installation process easy for you by maintaining a standard. The software available on the internet will be taken by Debian package maintainers, made into their corresponding .deb packages and put into the Debian repository.\n\nYou can read about it from a Debian Package maintainer's blog here : http://www.j4v4m4n.in/2012/05/01/debian-utsavam-at-mes-kuttippuram-kerala-2/\nAs for the advantages and disadvantages, .deb packages are managed by package managers such as apt and aptitude. So whenever you install a software with it, they will automatically figure out if you have the dependencies that are required to run that software on your system and will install them for you.\nBut if you are using a tar ball install it, you will have to figure out what that software depends on and each time you will have to check manually whether the dependencies of the software you are installing were already installed previously.\nBut apt does all this for you.\nAlso, installing from source (installing from tar balls) will have different methods for different software. There is the GNU philosophy of configure-make-make install and there are other methods depending on how the software is written.\nHowever, converting them into deb completely removes all these differences and makes it easier for the user to install and use the software.\nOne more point. When do you need to install from source? That is from a tar ball? There are basically two situations.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the debian packaging team has not yet packaged a software.\n\n*If you want to contribute to the project. That means you can make changes to the source code, compile it and test the changes.\n\n\nIf you would like to know more about debian packaging, you can read it from here : http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Debian (and hence Ubuntu) packages are collection of binaries and related instructions for their installation. This means that the package itself knows how and where to install, and it also knows the list of packages it depends on.\nSource tarballs (files with extension .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 - or even .tgz or .tbz2) are simply sets of files and directories that have been packed together with the tar utility and also compressed with either gzip or bzip2. To build the source code you have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*unpack the files with tar xvfz file.tar.gz or tar xvfj file.tar.bz2 (in an empty directory)\n\n*configure the package with ./configure (the package tests the system to see if everything is ok before starting the compilation)\n\n*start the compilation with make\n\n*if you want to, run make install to install the application to its \"default\" locatioon (usually in /usr/{s}bin or /usr/local/{s}bin but it depends on the application and on the distribution)\n\n\nThe main advantages of Debian/Ubuntu packages with respect to source tarballs are that packages are \"self-contained\" and their binaries are tracked. This means that the unpacking process is transparent to the user who just sees (roughly) one package per application. The user doesn't even need to remember what files a given application has installed and where, so the installation/removal of applications becomes (mostly) a one instruction process.\nThe main advantages of source tarballs with respect to binary packages are that in the first case the source code is compiled directly on the target machine and can then be optimized accordingly. Moreover, even the best package system can broke in particular cases (e.g. software packages too new or too old) and usually official packages are purged by servers when they become too old. In these cases one has to manually search the Internet for the desired application and for the specific libraries at specific versions to satisfy all its dependencies.\n\nA: I can see some pretty good answers already posted. But there are a few things that need to be addressed.\nContrary to what is known as \"dependency hell\" when it comes to compiling from source, you can actually configure Ubuntu in such a way that it automatically installs those dependencies when you are compiling from a tarball/ any source. \nRead how to do this here: \nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/106526/how-to-resolve-dependencies-while-compiling-software-on-ubuntu/\nAlso, if you keep that dependency problem aside, the good thing about tarballs is that you can configure lot of install related things like where to install etc, very easily in case of installing from source. \nAlso, the word \"Debian Packages\" could confuse you in this context. Remember that Debian packages come in two types like it says here:\nhttp://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html\nOf course, if you are talking only about deb files, then they generally are those compiled software like the above answers already said.\n\nA: Tar balls are usually source code that you have to compile. Debs are pre-compiled programs, already built and configured for Ubuntu/Debian. \nI would strongly suggest using debs when available, as they are easier, and they integrate with the package manager, so you can easily uninstall them.\nDebs will also install any dependencies needed. Installing from source can lead to what is affectionately called \"dependency hell\". Most open-source programs depend on several other programs/libraries to function. When installing from source, it will not install these, and will instead (hopefully) complain that a dependency is not met. You then try to install that dependency and then it bombs out, requiring another dependency, etc, etc. \nInstalling from source can also put your files in unexpected places, as different distros lay things out slightly different.\nWhen I need to install a program, I try my options in this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look in the Software Center. This is obviously the easiest, although the Software Center is not all-inclusive and is not up-to-date with the latest versions.\n\n*Try to find a repository that provides it. Adding a repository will make the program show up in the Software Center, receive timely upgrades, etc. \n\n*Look for a .deb package.\n\n*Install from source (tar ball).\n", "Q: Psensor only shows HDD and CPU usage, not temperature Okay I have psensor installed, I installed lm-sensor and some other related packages, I ran sensors-detect and didn't come up with anything.

In there, identify which partition you have got your linux installed on.

The partition will most probably be something like /dev/sda5 or something. Remember this partition.\n\n*Create a temporary folder in your home directory (Note: You can make the temporary folder anywhere you want. I’m using the home folder just for the sake of explanation). I’m calling it temp for now. So that temp folder’s path will be /home/ubuntu/temp.\n\n*Mount your linux partition there. That is, assuming that you found your linux partition to be /dev/sda5, you mount that at the ‘temp’ folder by doing the following command\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /home/ubuntu/temp\n\n\n*If you want to check whether you have mounted the correct partition, go to your home folder and open temp. You will be in the ‘/’ directory. In there you will find ‘home’, in which your home folder’s name will be there. Once you’ve confirmed you have mounted the correct partition, do step 6.\n\n*You have to install grub by showing the system where to read the data from the hard disk at the beginning.

Particular case: Matlab When I run Matlab from its launcher, a second icon will show up. Funny thing is that if I put the mouse on the new icon, the text that appears on it is not the one I have in my .desktop file. So my guess is that the launcher is launching the script but it is not capable of associating it with its icon, so it launches a secondary one.\nSo far it only happened with Matlab. \nI don't know what happened, it was working fine and now it doesn't. I don't feel I have changed anything.\nI have the .desktop file in .local/share/launchers.

After the installation succeeded, the computer restarted and since then I have not been able to use my keyboard or mouse (once I get to the graphical UI login screen).  \nIs it possible to rollback the installation to its previous state?  I am hoping to avoid a fresh install as I have installed a bunch of dev tools and its quite painful to have to re-install everything\n[EDIT] : Title changed.  The previous title was \"How to rollback Ubuntu installation to 64bit 11.10\" as installing Ubuntu 12.04 over 11.10 ended up making my computer unusable\n\nA: This is not really an answer to this question, but I was able to recover.  Essentially, since I dual boot with Windows, I am always presented with the option of \"Prior ubuntu version recovery mode\".  \n\n\n*\n\n*So I chose that  \n\n*chose the latest version in following screen  \n\n*Chose \"dpkg\" to fixbroken packages and let the installation continue clicking yes whenever prompted.\n\n\nThat ended up fixing the issue and I am able to use my computer now without re-installing.  So just to be clear, now I have 12.04 and since I didn't rollback, this is not really an answer for this question but I hope it is useful to someone facing the same situation\n\nA: It is impossible to roll back after such update. I'm afraid you need to reinstall 11.10 from scratch if you want it back.\nRegarding mouse and keyboard problem - there is a chance that update killed your Xorg configuration somehow. I'd suggest you to take a look into /etc/X11/xorg.conf and other relevant places.\nUPDATE:\nThere is a trick to save a package list and then bulk-install them on top of your fresh Ubuntu installation:\nSave a list of installed packages:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall > ubuntu-files\n\nNow, when you've a clean installation of Ubuntu, install them back:\ndpkg --set-selections < ubuntu-files\nsudo dselect\n\n\nA: Sorry, but a safe and wizarded downgrade is not possible. The best solution is backup everything and make a fresh install. You will find several topic around saying a downgrade is possible, but it's a manual operation that can be considered as equivalent as a fresh install after a backup.\nIf you could provide some logs, we could try to recover your installation and let you enjoy 12.04.\n", "Q: How to change touch screen functionality from a relative to an absolute pointing device?

I am creating a Juju charm to encompass many Django development projects. I have the charm installing Django, wsgi, and Apache2. Django uses a separate database, user, and password for every project created. How do I provide these credentials to the charm when the mysql charm has only one set of database credentials? I would like to parse the python paths for all installed Django projects and have a mysql charm ready to use with them.\nAs you can see below, the user will have to set these manually and change them when a new/different Django project is deployed to the cloud.\nuser=`relation-get user`\npassword=`relation-get password`\nhost=`relation-get host`\ndatabase=`relation-get database`\n\nMy question: Do I need to create a bash script to auto-create mysql charms with a correlating name to the Django project?\n\nA: You can create a new mysql charm with a new interface that can allocate dbs dynamically when requested and use that from your django charm, or deploy the projects as individual services. \nEffectively the new interface for mysql would have the hooks allocate new dbs as requested by the connecting service, instead of creating them when the new service is related/connected to mysql.\nAnother alternative, fix your django projects to use table prefixes, which I thought they already did (or maybe that's app table prefixing with project). \nEdit\nThe best solution might be to just use an admin interface relation, which gives you the root user on mysql and then you can create additional dbs as needed (pointed out to me on irc by clint) for all the django projects installed.\n\nA: The mysql charm has multiple interfaces, one of which is designed specifically for your app to have admin privileges over the whole server. So you would just make your relation\nrequires:\n  db:\n    interface: mysql-root\n\nThis will guarantee you a \"root\" users with privileges that you can use to create databases/users/etc. You won't get a 'database', since you can create any database, so keep that in mind.\n", "Q: License concerns for Ubuntu/Linux and a prospective business Having a hard time finding specifics, could someone link me to some materials concerning licensing issues of Ubuntu, and link's at large?\nI'm considering starting a business installing custom/embedded computer systems, and the open source nature of various Linux distros makes them the most attractive candidates  for final installation. I just want to make sure it would be legal to do so.\nWould I be able to charge for installation of the OS? If not, could I provide the customer the physical means for installation (CD, USB)?\n\nA: Yes, you can charge for it.  The only restriction is that you must provide your customers with the source code to the software.  Provided that you don't modify it, that is already handled by Canonical and the Ubuntu archive mirrors.\nSee also:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy\n\nA: I would also like to add\nhttp://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal\nThey are the \"official\" body for this sort of thing (non-distro related).\n", "Q: How can I paste text by pressing the left and right mouse buttons at the same time?

That leaves a package installed in your system, depending on the build-deps, that you can easily uninstall later.\n\nA: I found these commands on a Launchpad question:\nsudo aptitude markauto $(apt-cache showsrc PACKAGE_NAME | grep Build-Depends | perl -p -e 's/(?:[\\[(].+?[\\])]|Build-Depends:|,|\\|)//g')\n\nThere is also an alternative based around sed that copes with brackets in package names:\nsudo aptitude markauto $(apt-cache showsrc PACKAGE_NAME | sed -e '/Build-Depends/!d;s/Build-Depends: \\|,\\|([^)]*),*\\|\\[[^]]*\\]//g')\n\nNote: Replace PACKAGE_NAME with your own package.\n\nA: I don't think there's an automatic way. Packages installed through build-dep are recorded in the same way as if they'd been directly requested by name.\nIf you know approximately when you ran aptitude build-dep, you can find which packages got installed when you ran the command by looking through the logs in /var/log/aptitude* or /var/log/apt/*.\nYou can run apt-cache showsrc PACKAGENAME | grep '^Build-depends:' to list the build dependencies of the package. Review each of them to see if you want them; mark the ones you don't care about as not manually installed (apt-get markauto PACKAGENAME) and flush the non-required packages (apt-get autoremove).\n", "Q: Problems after upgrading to 12.04 - black screen after log in! \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nI just upgraded my stationary Dell to 12.04 but ran into problems.

My old MV Mobeus was already dual-booting the desktop and server versions of Ubuntu from the GRUB boot loader.\nI managed to upgrade the desktop version from 10.04 to 12.04 easily, and without any problems, but since I'd already hashed up my server installation, I decided to reinstall the server.\nI was soon told by the installer that my processor didn't have 'pae' (physical address extension), but leaves me to question whether or not there are significant kernel differences between desktop and server.\nBy the way, the processor is the Intel Pentium M 1.6Ghz, with Intel SpeedStep Technology.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 32bit ships with the PAE kernel by default, both the desktop and server editions, apparently. The generic 32bit kernel is still in the repositories, but if the CPU doesn't have PAE support, you can't use the regular installation image.

Also, a general question, if I install third party software other than those from Ubuntu repo, most of them don't have any uninstall scripts, how do I get rid of those cleanly? Thanks a ton\n\nA: Yes, you would want to uninstall emacs before installing it from source. \nsudo apt-get remove emacs\n\nThat should do the trick. \nIf they do not provide an uninstall script (usually made when you do a make/make install) in the source folder, you are pretty much out of luck for uninstalling cleanly, unless you can figure out what all it installed and where.\nI looked and couldn't find a current emacs repository, which makes install/uninstall much safer. In general, don't install outside of repos (or at the very least .debs), unless it is something you really need, just because it can be so messy.\n\nA: For a newbie like me, this threw me for awhile, because I knew I had to apt-get install to add emacs to my fresh 12.04 install, but running sudo apt-get remove emacs came back with Package emacs is not installed, so not removed.\nWhat was actually needed for me was:\nsudo apt-get remove emacs23\n\n", "Q: Installing Lubuntu without changing partitions I've just downloaded and burned Lubuntu to a disc, and want to install it.

This determines what kind of device is plugged into your computer and thus enables your OS to  initiate class dependent actions.\nIt is likely that your phone sends the device class identifier 01h Audio to Ubuntu. Therefore seemingly correct Rhythmbox is opened as we believed it was an mp3-player.\nUnless you are able to change this code from settings on your phone the easiest approach to avoid starting a media player is to turn off the default behaviour on what to do when a \"audio\"-USB-device is plugged in.\nA more basic approach would be to define a udev rule for a given device.\nWe have no experience with this software, but you may also be able to change the USB mode of a flip-flop device with the help of usb-modeswitch .\nSee the instructions on the support page for details on usage.\n\nA: You may disable this behaviour by going to system settings, details, removable media and select the 'do nothing' option.\n", "Q: Windows System Reserved Partition mounting in ubuntu 12.04 Guys I've installed windows 7 with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and both are working good.... the only issue i have is that whenever i boot into Ubuntu...at booting it says...\nThe disk drive for /windows is not ready yet or not present.\ncontinue to wait ,or press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery.\nAfter pressing S it boots n works great....but it shows the windows system reserved partition and if i click on it....it mounts...\nwhat i want to do is get rid to that annoying message and hide my windows system reserved partition.\nI know it has to do something with fstab but i'm new to Ubuntu so don't want to go messing about things..\nTHANKS for your help in advance\nThis is my fstab...\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

I find that some network cards, particularly those with older chipsets, have trouble making and maintaining connections to routers with a Channel Width of 40MHz (or a router set to auto, which can adjust itself among multiple widths).  For me, the solution was to change Channel Width to 20MHz.\n\nA: Open Network Connections\n\nGot to the «Wireless» tab and choose your net. Enter the BSSID. It is something like «00:11:22:33:44:55»\n\nFinally, check the «Wireless Security» tab.

I could not find time to restore the system until an hour ago, so please, excuse me for the delay in my answer.\nThanks a lot, reverendj1 & Bruno!\nreverendj1: The different kernel version was the correct clue, it produced the missing symbol in cifs.ko.\nThe problem, incredibly, was the consequence of an undetected USB disk: The one I use to boot Ubuntu up on a RAID.\nAs Ubuntu fails to mount the USB disk (that I have on fstab mounted to /boot), it creates a dummy /boot on the raid that of course does not exist during startup phase at BIOS, but it is the only one that exist during normal computer operation.\nAs I updated the kernel, the updated kernel (#38) was written to the dummy boot. The \"real\" (during startup) kernel (the older #37) remained in the external USB disk that is visible only during startup.\nThe only effect that I could perceive from this kernel mismatch was that the cifs driver could not load.\n", "Q: Nvidia Card not detected -- clean install -- Have tried many solutions I have a Dell L501x with a clean install (now clean, anyway) of 12.04.\nMy issue is that I do not have anything in the additional/restricted driver dialog.

My eventual goal is to play Minecraft with decent framerates.\nBrian\n\nA: Have you followed these instructions and still couldn't get your nvidia card to work?\n", "Q: Shell script that checks user activity and sends an email to the user in case of inactivity I need to check user activity under Linux (Ubuntu) and after 10 minutes I need to alert the user over email.\nBy inactivity, I'm referring to CPU usage of the processes that user is running. I tried using \"ps -a\" to get the user proceses, but I don't know how to check for specific CPU usage\n\nA: As your question is not terribly specific I can only guess at what you mean. If by user activity you mean keyboard or mouse, then this can by implemented in a few different ways. In a bash script you can use the command xprintidle (in the standard repositories). Then, if you have the appropriate email set up, you can use e.g. the mail command to send the email.\nAlternatively, after detecting the timeout you can also call e.g. a python script and get it to send and email using standard protocols and you favorite email account e.g. gmail. You can read about that e.g. here For sompleteness sake, I have pasted the code example from that page here:\nimport smtplib\n\nfromaddr = 'fromuser@gmail.com'\ntoaddrs  = 'touser@gmail.com'\nmsg = 'There was a terrible error that occured and I wanted you to know!'\n\n# Credentials (if needed)\nusername = 'username'\npassword = 'password'\n\n# The actual mail send\nserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com:587')\nserver.starttls()\nserver.login(username,password)\nserver.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg)\nserver.quit()\n\nIf you want, you can also keep the entire thing in python. The standard recipe is to use the ctypes module to access libX. I have previously tried implementing one of these recipes and (with the exception of sometime having to replace a few of the lib paths) it works really well. I wont paste those code examples here as they are huge and found on several websites e.g. here, if you want more search for \"python x idle time\" maybe add ubuntu or linux.\nIf you have more specific questions to one of these approaches let me know and please also elaborate a little more in your question.\n", "Q: Which version of Java should I use for Minecraft? What version of java do I need for minecraft and how would I install it I've been to multiple forums but can't figure it out.\n\nA: You can install OpenJDK by pressing this link. After, open Minecraft with right-click in Minecraft.jar > Open with > OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime.\nIf it's still not working, press this link, and do the same as before.\n\nA: I am running minecraft on 12.04 by following these steps:\nA. Open a terminal, and enter \nsudo apt-get purge openjdk*\nThis is a \"housekeeping\" step that may or may not apply to your setup.\nB.

I prefer following the instructions to install minecraft found at http://debianhelp.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/how-to-install-minecraft-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts/.\nIt neatly integrates launching the game into Unity, and it opens like any other application (so no right-clicking to run the file). Only follow the last two steps in the tutorial (\"Download and untar installation bash script\" and \"To install Minecraft Client\").\nD. After installing everything, I would recommended you update the LWJGL files using the link and instructions found at http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Update_LWJGL (essentially what Minecraft uses for graphics, sound, and input).\nThis update should prevent some common issues that bugged me (i.e., sound cutting out while running the game). CAUTION: be sure to back up the files you're updating with the new LWJGL files, just in case.\n\nA: Download OpenJDK instead of Java, works better on Ubuntu and it's Open Source with better Linux support. You can download and Install it from Ubuntu Software Centre. Open JDK 6 and 7 are available, 7 is newer, I recommend you install this.\nThen In minecraft.jar properties, select Open With OpenJDK 7 Runtime \n", "Q: Unity greeter background not changing for users automatically after upgrade I have recently upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04. Normal upgrade, no new installation. In 11.10 I was using Simple LightDM Manager tool to set a custom wallpaper on the login screen. This tool unfortunately doesn't seem to do anything since I have upgraded. I have also heard that 12.04 is suppose to have this feature (changing login wallpaper per different user) by default. I have searched in settings but unfortunately in vain. \nSo, to keep it short, could somebody direct me to the option(s) page where I can make the desired changes.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you want the desktop background for the login screen to change depending on which user is highlighted.\nYes, it does do this by default (it sets it to the one the user uses). The caveat is that since you upgraded, it doesn't automatically set this for existing users. \nSimply change the wallpaper for each user, then change it back to what you had before. This will update the login screen to show the correct wallpapers. I had to do this with network users.\n\nA: Recently I ran into the same problem and discovered there are two key settings that need to be enabled for this to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your wallpaper is readable by lightdm.\n\n*Enable unity-greeter background drawing.

After update 11.10 to 12.04 I have a HP pavillion, (Graphics GeForce GT 220/PCIe/SSE2) and after the update this problem came. It looks like I zoomed in on the screen, but the edges are 'there' when I click the mouse. I tried a couple of things, and the problem is under all users, and already there at the login screen. I looked at the Nvidia settings, but I know not enough to see an error. It shows the correct monitor, 1680x1050, and an overscan of 0%.\nI saw my xorg.conf is rather long, after many updates. What can I do? I would like to try to refresh the installation of my xserver, or desktop, ultimately I would do a clean install. But if someone knows a better way out I would be very gratefull!\nMark\n\nA: These days very few Ubuntu computers need anything at all in their xorg configuration files since modern xorg servers create a configuration on the fly. It may be that the reason you have one is because your system has been updated from much older versions where they were often critical.\nIf you are comfortable using Alt-Control-F1 to make changes, you might use it to rename your /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Even if it fails utterly the xorg server should use a reduced resolution failsafe configuration but it's safer if you know how to use Alt-Control-F1 to go back--just in case.\nAs an alternative, you can try various resolutions with the Display system settings control or the xrandr command.\nmodelines are used to generate various clock signals within your graphics adapter. These signals need to be compatible with both your adapter and your monitor. They affect how much margin there is between when the adapter sends a signal to start displaying a line of pixels when those pixels should start to be sent to the monitor and how long to wait after sending the pixels before starting the next line of pixels. Getting an appropriate mode set up may be key to solving your problem.\nSince this is related to resolution problems this might be helpful.\n\nA: I had an issue like this on Ubuntu 14.04.  My issue occurred after updating the graphics driver.  I was able to see the rest of the screen by lowering my resolution down to the next highest setting.\n", "Q: Hope-DT GTK+ theme displays white fonts after upgrade to 12.04 I have recently upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04.

They needed to be upgraded to (I think) in order to work properly with Gnome 3.4. I went to the creator's website and found a version for Ubuntu 12.04, and it has worked perfectly.

I only have a problem, I connect to the internet through a proxy at my college, but there are some url's that I don't need the proxy for, so my question is: How can I exempt a url from my proxy configuration on Ubuntu?\n\nA: You may need a proxy configuration script (PAC). It is a universal solution, and works in any DE, any platform, with any browser.\nIn your proxy settings, either in browser, or from Network in Unity, select 'Automatic proxy configuration URL' and type in a path like /home/<Your-user-name>/proxy or some other convinient path.\nOpen a text editor, ( Search in Dash to find gedit -the default text editor) and write something like this. Save it to the path entered above, when done. Modify to your needs.\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host)\n{\n// Loopback and localhost goes browser direct always.\n    var reip;\n    if ((host == \"localhost\") ||\n           (shExpMatch(host, \"localhost.*\")) ||\n           (shExpMatch(host,\"10.*\")) ||\n           (shExpMatch(host,\"172.16.*\")) || \n           (shExpMatch(host,\"192.168.*\")) ||\n           (shExpMatch(host,\"144.16.128.*\")) ||\n           (host == \"127.0.0.1\")) {\n        return \"DIRECT\";\n    } \n// Local Sites\n    if (dnsDomainIs(host, \".example.com\") ||\n       dnsDomainIs(host, \".qwerty.org\")) {\n        return \"DIRECT\";\n    }\n// Test to see if host is an IP address\n// Put any ranges you want to skip proxy here.\n    reip = /^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$/g;\n    if (reip.test(host)) {\n        if (isInNet(host, \"10.0.0.0\", \"255.0.0.0\") ||\n            isInNet(host, \"172.16.0.0\", \"255.255.0.0\") ||\n            isInNet(host, \"144.16.128.0\", \"255.255.240.0\") ||\n            isInNet(host,\"192.168.0.0\", \"255.255.0.0\")) {\n             return \"DIRECT\";\n        }\n    }\n// Default to proxy.\n    return \"PROXY <server>:<port>\";\n}\n\nAs you see, complex configurations can be made out of PAC scripts. The above script skips proxy for any address of type *.example.com and *.qwerty.org and any ip that matches the ranges. All other requests are routed through proxy server.\nP.S: I've seen a empty line at top and bottom in all PAC scripts I've seen so far, so I suggest you add a newline both at top and mottom. Just in case...\n\nA: If you are just using an http proxy you can open gconf-editor (sudo apt-get install gconf-editor, if you don't have it already) navigate to system:http_proxy and add the urls you want to exempt into the ignore_hosts key, separated by commas I believe. (see picture below)\n\nIf you are using a socks5 proxy it's a little more complicated to set system wide.  However for certain individual programs it's quite easy.  For Firefox for example, go to edit:preferences:advanced:(connection)settings then change it from Use system proxy settings or whatever it is to Manual proxy configuration, then enter your proxy information and add the urls you don't want in the No proxy for field, once again separated by commas. (See screenshot below)\n\nIf you use Chromium you can run it with command line switches, for example /etc/bin/chromium-browser --proxy-bypass-list=\"localhost,127.0.0.1,xxx.xxx.xx.etc\" --proxy-server=\"socks5://localhost:1080\".\nSome other applications will have similar functionality, and you can use a wrapper program like tsocks for those that don't.\n", "Q: Is there any need to install amd graphics drivers if I am running Ubuntu Server?

This inevitably ends up corrupting some files and my OS either won't boot up correctly or I have sever sofware problems. \nI haven't done the hard reset yet, and I am wondering if there's anything I can do to avoid doing the hard reset, and potentially saving my system from damage?\n\nA: maybe my answer from https://askubuntu.com/a/140945/65352 will be useful to you:\nEssentially, since I dual boot with Windows, I am always presented with the option of \"Prior ubuntu version recovery mode\".  \n\n\n*\n\n*So I chose that  \n\n*chose the latest version in following screen  \n\n*Chose \"dpkg\" to fixbroken packages and let the installation continue clicking yes whenever prompted.\n\n\nThat ended up fixing the issue and I am able to use my computer now without re-installing.  So just to be clear, now I have 12.04 and since I didn't rollback, this is not really an answer for this question but I hope it is useful to someone facing the same situation\n\nA: I didn't need to do anything. (This time) \nI did the hard re-start with great hesitation, and the system still boots and runs fine (fingers crossed). \n", "Q: Take a screenshot of webpage at intervals? I need a way to refresh a certain webpage and have a screenshot taken approximately every 5 minutes. I'm new with Ubuntu, but willing to use terminal, etc. If steps are given, I've used it before, I just don't know how to go about writing my own scripts. \nIdeally, I would have the webpage open, and the page would refresh and take a screenshot every 5 minutes. Any help with this? \n\nA: The screenshot app 'shutter' has what you are looking for.\nIn a terminal, do sudo apt-get install shutter\nThere is no GUI way to do this every five minutes with shutter, but we can make it do the job with the command line.\nCopy the following into gedit:\n #! /bin/bash\n while true; do\n     shutter --web='WWW-HERE' -e\n     sleep 5m\n done\n\nReplace WWW-HERE with the address you would like to screenshot. Now save it in your home folder with a name that you can remember and wish to call it with.\nOpen a terminal and do chmod +x FILE and then sudo cp FILE /usr/local/bin\nRemembering to replace FILE with the name you chose.\nNow you can open a terminal and type the file name you chose to start it taking screen shots every five minutes. To stop it, press Ctrl + C on your keyboard. If you want it to keep going until you logout, you can just type the name you chose after pressing Alt + F2, and it will keep going forever in the background.\nTo save the files somewhere else or with a special name you can add the --output flag to the shutter command(before the -e!). So change that line to read something like this for example:\nshutter --web='WWW-HERE' --output='~/Shots/Web%Y%m%d%T' -e\n\nThis saves to  folder called Shots (must exist!) in your home folder, and names the file given the time and date.\nAlternately you can open shutter and navigate to Edit > Preferences and select a directory there where you would like to save.\n\nAn example screenshot of today's google doodle is here.\n\nA: Note: I haven't tried this but you could use something like scrot (to take the screenshot) and an \"at\" command to do the the trick. Here's two resources that might be helpful:\nScreenshots from the terminal: http://tips.webdesign10.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-with-ubuntu-linux\nUsing the \"at\" command: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-job-scheduling/index.html\n\nA: I once had a script to take a photo of my screen every minute and upload it. I've tried to create something similar for you here. As Mordoc mentioned, you can use scrot .  You will have to sudo apt-get install scrot first.\nHere's the script.  The lines starting with \"#\" are comments, so I'll use them to try and explain it:\n#!/bin/bash\n# ^This first line just tells linux which script language to use.\n#  We're using bash\n\n# Because this script runs as a Cron-job, it runs as root and doesn't\n# necessarily know which user you're logged in as.  For me, this says \"use\n# the default display, ie the first person logged in on the computer\"\nDISPLAY=:0\nHOME=/home/vose\nexport DISPLAY\nexport HOME\n\n# Create the screenshots directory in case it doesn't exist yet\nmkdir -p /home/vose/Pictures/Screenshots/\n\n# Delete any screenshots more than 7 days old.\nfind /home/vose/Pictures/Screenshots/ -type f -mtime +7 -delete\n\n# Launch the browser (I use firefox for normal, so I'll use chrome for this)\n# The \"sudo -u vose ...\" means \"run the command as user `vose`\".  You'll\n# You'll need to put your username in there...\n# The \"&\" at the end means 'launch in the background', so the script\n# can keep going.\necho \"Opening the browser\"\nsudo -u vose chromium-browser http://google.com &\n\n# This records the ProcessID (pid) of the last opened program\n# (chromium) so we can kill it later\npid=$!\n\n# Wait 10 seconds for the browser to open and page to load\n# On a slow computer/connection/webpage you may need to wait longer\nsleep 10\n\n# Take the screenshot using scrot.  Save it to this file\nscrot /home/vose/Pictures/Screenshots/screenshot_`date +%F-%H-%M-%S`.jpg\necho \"Created screenshot_`date +%F-%H-%M-%S`.jpg\"\n\n# Kill the browser\nkill $pid\n\nBefore you try go too far, stop and see if this works.  \n\n\n*\n\n*First, save the script above as takeScreenshot.sh.  \n\n*Then from a terminal, type chmod +x takeScreenshot.sh  (Chmod changes the permissions on a file, and '+x' means we're giving it permission to \"execute\" the script.)\n\n*Run ./takeScreenshot.sh from a command line - this will run the script manually.  See if the file shows up in your pictures folder after doing this.\n\n*If that worked, we need to now add it to Cron.\nAt a command line, type sudo crontab -e.  (If it asks you which editor, choose Nano.  If you haven't used it before, ask around for some help).\nIn the file, you want to add a line at the bottom, like this:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n*/5 * * * * /home/vose/Scripts/takeScreenshot.sh\n\nWhat this says:\n\n\n*\n\n*Every 5 minutes\n\n*Every hour, every day-of-month, every month, every day-of-week\n\n*Run \"/home/vose/Scripts/takeScreenshot.sh\"\n\n\n(one small gotcha: make sure there is a blank line after your entry in the crontab.  The last line of the file gets ignored, so you need a blank line after your command).\nWell, I hope this long post helps! There might be ways to do this without the command line, but you'll have to look around.\n\nA: Give a try this tool : http://www.domdigger.com/\n It's not every 5 minutes, but if one-hour interval is enough for you, it's perfect for your needs.\n", "Q: I cannot right click on the desktop It was activating a few options of compiz config, but when it activates the option \"wallpaper\", to be able to have different images in every office. first I unite awhile the screen, which is normal, that in order that it works this option it is necessary to deactivate a thing in ubuntu tweak or in gnome tweak tool, after deactivating it works perfectly.

I am currently running Windows 7 on my system and want to try out Linux, but I'm afraid to download it and have something happen to my computer. Can I somehow download Ubuntu and when I start up my computer have an option on running either Ubuntu or windows?\n\nA: Ubuntu is exactly what you need to try it out, and install it side-by-side with your current os:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the current desktop ubuntu version and burn the to a cd\n\n*restart your pc, enable boot from cd\n\n*you will be taken to a full graphical desktop with two options:\n\n*\n\n*try out\n\n*install\n\n\n\nIn the try out mode, ubuntu will run entirely from the cd (so it's a bit slow when starting up applications for the first time). You can even access your files.\nWhen you decide you want to install ubuntu, select that option on the desktop. The installer can resize your windows partition and install a boot loader which allows booting into windows or linux. \n\nA: I believe that what you want is wubi.exe found here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer . Wubi will allow you to easily install and use Ubuntu without disturbing your currently installation. You will get everything out of a wubi.exe installation as you would with a completely separate Ubuntu installation.\nAfter getting familiar with Ubuntu you might look at installing Ubuntu on another partition on you computer.\n\nA: Wubi is the safest way to do it if your biggest concern is not messing your current OS. It installs from Windows just like any other program and does exactly what you're wanting it to do: every time you restart your computer it will ask you if you want to run Ubuntu or Windows. And if you decide down the road that you don't like it, you can uninstall it from the Windows Control Panel, just like any other program. \n\nA: If you have a system with pretty good configuration and are worried too much, you can try out Ubuntu on a virtual box. That wouldn't hurt your system in anyway. It will be like running Ubuntu as just another application in Windows.\n", "Q: How do I navigate to sabnzbd.ini in Debian? I need to locate this file, and apparently it's in ~/.sabnzbd/. Total Linux newcomer here, how do I access that file?\n\nA: Since the name of the folder has a . in front of it, it is hidden by the file manager. All files and folders that have a period as the first character in their name will be automatically hidden by file managers. To see them, you usually have to enable the viewing of hidden files and folders, which can typically be done using a simple keyboard shortcut. The keyboard shortcut in the default Gnome file manager is Ctrl + H. Press the keyboard shortcut to see hidden files and folders, press it again to hide them again.\nSo to navigate to that particular folder, open your home folder (go to the launchers on the left and click the folder) and press Ctrl + H. Then you will see, in the list of files and folders, .sabnzbd. If you don't want to see all of your hidden files and folders again, press Ctrl + H while the window is still open.\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 8100 won't Suspend or Hibernate have a Dell Inspiron 8100 running Lubuntu 11.10 & doing it very well with one exception.

When I close the lid it will not suspend & upon open it has a blank screen & requires a force shutdown.\nFirst - I read the hardware most likely did not support suspend.\nThen I found in the Hardware Compatibility section:\nI will you advise to change the driver in xorg.conf to the 3d acceleration driver from ati.

When I attempted to use the SAVE command it asked me to install it (did that) but afraid I really have no idea what I'm doing.\nAm armed with a whole dictionary of Linux commands now but need some help getting started.  Perhaps if I could just get one thing to work it would be a jumping off point.  e.g. would like to see the \"unload_modules\" file there after performing the steps above.\nthanks,\ndaemoncycler\n\nA: What you read in the Hardware Compatibility section was indicating that the driver for your graphics card won't let you suspend. I have the same thing; it stinks. Disable the ATI catalyst driver (you'll probably do this under Additional Drivers (aka Jockey)). You may notice significant decreases in graphics performance, but you will be able to suspend and/or hibernate successfully.\n\nA: I had a similar experience with my Dell inspiron and i followed these steps, it helped me solved the problem.\nhttp://www.w7forums.com/wont-sleep-hibernate-t5577.html\n", "Q: Why does music start playing when I log in? When I login I suddenly start to hear music. I haven't configured anything to do this. As I start to do things the music stops. What causes this?\n\nA: When you login your cursor is positioned at the center of your desktop.\nIf there happens to be an sound file there your system can helpfully preview (play) it.\nIt may sound trivial or silly but when it happened it astonished me until I realized the reason. It also surprised one other person I've corresponded with.\n", "Q: How can i get the MacOS green + button function in Ubuntu?

This is a historic difference between X-Windows and MacOS. Applications under X will probably expect to be maximized, minimized and manually resized, but few will expect to choose an optimum size and there isn't a standard mechanism for telling them to do so.\n", "Q: How do I apply an Indian language system-wide?

Open Language Support from within Software Settings.\n\n\n*Click Install/Remove Languages and select the Indian language(s) you want to install, click Apply Changes.\n\n\n*Let the process finish.\n\n\n*Now you have to click and drag the languages you want (in order of preference) to the top of the Language for Menus and Windows box.

Also I'm assuming that your computer loads into Ubuntu by default.  If not, please don't do this just yet.  Change Ubuntu to your default first, then delete Windows.\nSearch for the \"Disk Utility\" program and open it.  Have a look around at the disks on your left, and you should find the disk (or 'partition' if you have windows installed on the same disk as linux) that Windows XP is on.\n\nUnder \"Volumes\" select the Windows partition\n\nAnd then click \"Format Volume\".  This will wipe out the XP installation, and you can choose to give the drive another name for use in Linux.  (By the way, leave \"Type\" set to \"Ext4\").\n\nIf the Windows partition was on the same drive as your Linux, depending on how it's setup you might also be able to choose \"Delete Partition\" and then resize your Linux to fill up the space, but this doesn't always work.  Easier to format it and give it a new name.\n", "Q: How to get username back on the Unity panel?

Does that mean it's showing the temperature of the installed RAM module or something else?\nI would also like to know if the temperature is normal or overheated?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Physical id 0 is referring to your CPU.  The CPU TJmax is 100 degrees Celsius.  So 50 degrees Celsius is normal.  Also  make sure that ambient temperature is good.\n\nA: To complete the above answer which is obviously correct, here is the full list of Psensor sensord ids and corresponding type of chips:\n\n*\n\n*‘lmsensor coretemp’: Intel CPU.\n\n*‘lmsensor k10temp’,'lmsensor k8temp’,'lmsensor fam15h_power’: AMD CPU.\n\n*‘nvidia’ or ‘lmsensor nouveau’: NVIDIA GPU.\n\n*‘hdd’: hard disk drive.\n\n*‘amd’: AMD GPU.\n\n*‘lmsensor C B’: C is the name of the chip, B the name of the adapter.\n\nThis information is also available at: https://wpitchoune.net/psensor/faq.html#S_WhatIsTheSensor\nSince Psensor 0.7.0.4, the chip name is available in the sensor information window:\n\nSome technical information about your CPU is available at: http://ark.intel.com/products/53469, maximal temperature is 100C (Tjunction), so 50C is fine.\n", "Q: Changing default directory in Quickly I'm unhappy with the fact that Quickly creates all my new projects in my Home directory. I figured it would be something in create.py in the template's folder, but I'm new enough to Python and Quickly that I can't figure it out. I'm sure this is an easy answer, how do I change the directory where Quickly creates new folders?\n\nA: Quickly will create a folder wherever you invoke it from. Just make sure you change the current directory to the location where you want it to create the folder containing your new app first, and then run the quickly create command. \nSo for example, if you want to create a test app that you're not going to keep in the /tmp folder, you can run it with:\ncd /tmp\nquickly create ubuntu-application TestApp\n\nThen Quickly will create the app under /tmp/testapp\n", "Q: Cant verify checksum for downloaded LTS 12.04 ISO and can't verify burn either I tried to verify my download checksum in mac's disk utility but it couldn't find a checksum to verify.Also tried to burn ISO at slowest speed and still it couldn't verify the burn.

You will see no read/write differences vs. XFS except in extreme edge cases (mass deletions of hundreds of thousands of small files, for example).\nYou will also find more community support for ext4 at places like AskUbuntu, simply because it is so widely used.\nOne notable disadvantage of XFS is that it cannot be shrunk (decrease partition size), so you would have to backup, repartition/reformat, restore if you ever wanted to decrease your XFS partition size.\n\nA: ext4\nThat was my recommendation in 2012 and it is the recommended FS in 2017. This file system is very mature with support for encryption (recent Kernel needed as of 2017) and is fast enough for most workload on an external hard drive (and even external SSDs), it is also a very safe choice with respect to data safety. That's an important factor especially when you have an external hard disk, it is not as protected as an internal one.\nOn a laptop for instance, even if the electricity is plugged out, you still have a battery, so the internal had drive is rather safe. However, an external plugged hard disk can be prone to disconnection, e.g.: you get up with your laptop while forgeting about the attached drive.\nXFS\nProvides good performance for many enterprise work load, and probably some desktop ones too. Probably those edge cases are not visible on an external USB hard drive, could be visible with external SSDs on a USB3.1 interface. There was a higher risk than upon disconnection or loss of power than some of the files are truncated to 0 with XFS, for many years this should not be an issue. XFS is now a robust and fast file system even in the event of power-loss.\nYou can implement encryption with XFS if you use LUKS for example. But I'm not aware of a native support within XFS for encryption.\nBTRFS\nIn 2012 I stated \"In 1 or 2 years I would recommend that file system as it supports checksum for data and journal\". In 2017 I can say that this file system is pretty robust unless you want to use its RAID 5-6 support (for it you would need a very recent Kernel, so better wait for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). On an external hard disk, which is more exposed than an internal one, BTRFS would be a very strong solution with its native checksuming of data and metadata. However if you only have one external hard drive, it will be only able to detect corrupted data but won't be able to repair them unless you set it up to store 2 copies of each data or metadata on the drive. In case of disk loss, you lose of course everything, so it is not RAID1. But if you have a corrupted sector, BTRFS could recover it if it has a copy. BTRFS supports snapshots, which could be a nice addition for a backup system.\nIt is not my recommended file system because it has a few peculiarities like understanding properly the disk usage and free space problems (especially if you use the compression option). In my use of BTRFS, I've also encountered a few times error with no space left on device which requires some balancing, etc. So it is not yet usable by a novice users.\n\nA: The answer depends on your precise requirements.  \next4 has become the default filesystem for several of the popular Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora and openSUSE. ext4 features several improvements over its predecessor, amongst which include support for files upto 16 tebibytes ( 1 tebibytes equals 1,024 gibibyes , with 1gibibyte equal to 1.074 gigabytes) and a maximum volume size of upto 1 Exbibyte. It is backward compatible with ext3 and ext2, making it possible to mount ext3 and ext2 as ext4. This will slightly improve performance, because certain new features of ext4 can also be used with ext3 and ext2, such as the new block allocation algorithm.\nXFS is a highly scalable, high-performance file system which was originally designed at Silicon Graphics, Inc. It was created to support extremely large filesystems.  XFS supports a maximum file system size of 8 exbibytes minus one (i.e. 263-1 bytes), though this is subject to block limits imposed by the host operating system. 32-bit Linux systems limit both file and file system size to 16 tebibytes.\nThere is a lot of information out there on this subject, but I would Start Here and try to explore if you want to take this further.\nI hope this helps.\nSources: \n- http://techie-buzz.com/foss/google-implements-ext4.html \n- http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/6.0_Release_Notes/filesystems.html\n\nA: I have seen many Benchmarks of these filesystems,\nI think is better EXT4, but the difference with XFS i think is minimal... \nIn read/write benchmarks there are not so many differences and i use EXT4, and it is fantastic. \n\nA: I'd recommend against ext4 if you have serious workload.\nWe have two build servers that run concurrent builds of our software, and if we do more than 1 concurrent build, we get hung tasks, which then force the build to exit. If we do only 1 build at a time, it completes fine. However, this defeats the purpose of having a multi-cpu, multi-core machine which could theoretically do 8 simultaneous builds (or 1 -j8 build)\nExperience with ext4 isn't too good. It's still too young to use in the real world.\n\nA: XFS is the best choice here since external drives are CPU intensive and highly dependent on the USB bus. When using extreme low power or high performance applications choices like these make a huge difference. XFS has worked great for me on an Atom N450 based appliance I built at home. It uses a whopping 9W and serves data fine.\n", "Q: The '$' command outputs \"command not found\" The '$' command gives the result and then outputs \"command not found\" in the terminal?\n\nA: The original question listed '$0', which is a positional parameter, not a command. \nTo display it's value without an error you should use\n echo \"$0\"\n\n", "Q: Install Desktop Environments or use different distributions For you that have tested this, should we use Ubuntu and install different Desktop Environments (KDE/XFCE...) or we should install different distributions (Kubuntu/Xubuntu...). Are there any notable issues in performance / CPU consumption?\nPS:\nI know how to install them (already did), I wanted to know if anyone has any problems regarding the performance and what is better to install the desktop or to use the ditribution\n\nA: Yes, You can install different desktop environment on the default system. For example, installing kubuntu-desktop package on Ubuntu system. \nThe difference is -- \n\n\n*\n\n*When you install kubuntu-desktop package on Ubuntu, it will download all the packages of the kubuntu CD. so, more than one web-browser, office software (such as Abiword, Gnumeric installed with XFCE), chat software, partition editor, terminals and etc. So if you want a cleaner system, a clean install with only the preferred Desktop Environment is recommended.\n\n*But you should be aware of the fact that you need to install your necessary software on each installed system. So, this method is a bit expensive.\n\n*You should also aware of some incompatibility issue of firefox font-rendering between KDE and GNOME system. also exo-utils related workaround which occur with XFCE installation. Search Google and Ubuntu-forum for more information about these issue.\nNote about Integration\nI recently installed kubuntu-desktop in the default Ubuntu. The first point I noted is, The smooth integration between default Ubuntu and KDE. Also KDE more memory friendly now.\nMy Suggestion\nMy Suggestion is Install Ubuntu and Kubuntu as separate system if you prefer smooth Integration. You can install lubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop on the Ubuntu system. Because these use most of the Gnome libraries. But I installed kubuntu-desktop on top of Ubuntu, and I think this is good now.\nNote 2\nYou can try only the Desktop Environment without installing many more extra softwares by using --no-install-recommends switch to apt-get command line. For example\nFor Kubuntu\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends kubuntu-desktop. Kubuntu  \nFor Xubuntu\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xubuntu-desktop. Xubuntu \nFor Lubuntu\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends lubuntu-desktop. Lubuntu \n\nA: *\n\n*All *buntus are the SAME EXACT Operating System, the difference\nresides in\n\n*The Desktop environments, and the default software all come with their own set of issues, and\ndifferent performance.\n\n\nInstalling kubuntu-desktop, xubuntu-desktop, lubuntu-desktop will give you the same results.\nThe heavier environment would be KDE the lightest LXDE.\nThe results are the same regardless of which *buntu you have already installed, you'll only have the extra software you download + the one you already have. So installing Ubuntu and then downloading the corresponding KDE package is no different than having Kubuntu and downloading the corresping Ubuntu package.\n\nA: There is a lot of difference between Xfce and Xubuntu-desktop and similarly with lxde and lubuntu-desktop , kubuntu-desktop and KDE .\nthese XFCE,KDE,LXDE  just environments and these are not gonna give you any other pkg's .\nbut Xubuntu-desktop,Lubuntu-desktop,Kubuntu-desktop will give you some applications along with desktop environments . \nso if you try those environments then i would suggest you to just go with installation of those environments only,  not the desktops . \nand you can get those Environments in a easy way from software center by typing them on Search box .\n\nA: Using Xubuntu or installing Xfce under Ubuntu is almost the same.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you already have installed Ubuntu, is better to install the\nenvironment only.\n\n*If you haven't installed anything yet, install the\nflavor you prefer.\n\n\nIf you want to try or have many environments at the same time, is better to use Ubuntu as base for all of them.\n", "Q: Bridged networking in KVM I'm using ubuntu 10.04 with qemu-kvm installed.

This is called Dual-booting.\nThe easiest and safest way is to create an empty drive in windows, delete it to get free space, and install Ubuntu using Live CD or Live USB, choosing the option 'Install alongside Windows'. The setup will automatically install into the free space created by you.\nEven if you directly boot from cd without creating free space, The installer will attempt to resize your windows partition and will install alongside. But there is one in a thousand chance that this may cause data loss, since NTFS file system is not effectively manipulated from Ubuntu (yet), I suggest making free space from windows before proceeding.\n\nA: yes you can . after inserting the LIVE CD , moving with regular steps , stop at this . \nso there 1st and 3rd options are good for you to keep windows and install Ubuntu .Remember dont touch the WINDOWS partition while doing the installation process  and remaining all are same as a normal installation process . \nAll the best . \nBut as our one of the answer saying its not possible with win-8 , i too heard about win-8 is going to behave like as he said but give a try my friend ,we loss nothing with a try . \n", "Q: How can I install Cinnamon on a minimal CLI installation?

This gets really annoying when I'm somewhere it should be quiet (library, train etc.). It would also be nice to have some delay in resuming radiotray playback after unlocking the screen to be able to react to the situation I'm in.\nHow do I prevent that behaviour (ok, besides turning radiotray off before suspending)?\n\nA: Running 10.04, as a workaround to avoid this quite annoying behaviour, I put together the script below and saved it as /etc/pm/sleep.d/13_radiotray.\n(In terminal: gksudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/13_radiotray, enter/paste the script code, save the file and finally make it executable with: sudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/13_radiotray.)\nAs you can see, what it does is: if radiotray was running on suspend/hibernate, it gets killed on resume/thaw and then restarted in \"idle\" mode.

When not in use every 5 to 10 seconds HDD is active for about 10 seconds an writing no mater what application is turned on or running. I used iotop and found that jbd2 is constantly writing to the HDD. The noise of the HDD is driving me crazy, at this rate disk will not last long. On the same HDD I have Windows 7 (dual boot Grub2) and everything works OK, the disk is turned off when not in use, and the computer is silent. Everything else is working fine (just little problems with Skype and the webcam, but that is tolerable), but fear from losing disk and noise is untolerable since I have computer turned on for 10 hours a day...\nI tried manually to lower the frequency of journalling, but no solution found on web helped me so far, disk is grinding at same rate.\nAny solution of this problem? If not I think I will stop using Ubuntu, no HDD will last long at this rate of use and the noise from HDD is not tolerable...\n\nA: This are rare cases where the Hard Drive activity is above the normal use and the user is not using it that much. It has only happened to me twice in all of my years with Ubuntu. On one time I solved the issue by doing a fsck on the disk.\nFor example, if your HDD is /dev/sdb1 then do the following:\nsudo fsck /dev/sdb1\n\nIn that case it said that I had booted the hard drive more than 200 times without checking. I actually did not count how many times but 200 is a lot in my book.\nAnyway, when started checking, at some point it started finding problems and fixing them. A lot of them actually. After that I rebooted and problem was gone.\nIn the second case, it was because I edited the /etc/fstab and incorrectly passed a parameter to the hdd. The solution was to remove that parameter from it.\nI would also have to say that adding noatime to the hard drive lessens the amount of write operations. For example this is my HDD in the fstab file:\n# / was on /dev/sda2 during installation\nUUID=38673e00-ecc8-4e11-85d2-58af72999e5b /               ext4    noatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nwith the noatime parameter, the disk activity is less. Although, if using a version of the kernel 2.6.30 or greater, relatime is much better.\nMy suggestion for this would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run fsck on the drive with the problem. It might detect many problems or it might not, but checking it will make sure the information is good and the hard drive has no file system problems.\n\n*In the Desktop run the disks utility. It shows the status of the drive and the SMART information about it. This can give you further information about it, specially if it has a hardware problem.\n\n*Type dmesg and look at the last lines. If there is something every 10 seconds it will show there. It can also show in cat /var/log/syslog or cat /var/log/kern.log\n\n*Lastly add the noatime parameter to your fstab file to save some access time writings.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you are seeing a lot of activity when nothing much is running, check if any of the logs are getting a lot of updates. See if any of the files grow when you run this ... \nls -lS /var/log/*log | head\n\n\n*You can reduce spindowns, if your hard disc supports SMART,  with \nhdparm -B 255 /dev/sdX\n\nwhere sdX needs to be changed to a valid partition.\n\n*Check your fstab for noatime. \n\n*From the last link below someone claims he solved it with a forced check of the partition.\ntouch /forcecheck\n\nand a reboot will confirm if this is the case for you. \n\nAlso have a look at this topic:\next4 jbd2 journaling active even on empty filesystem\n\nThis is more than likely a kernel problem (and not specifically related to Ubuntu). In 2010 both Ubuntu and Arch users had the same problem. It might be worth it posting it as a bug on launchpad against the kernel you are using.\n\nA: I had this issue with a Lenovo/Thinkpad and I tried everything but in the end I found it was a Toshiba drive. The Toshiba drives have a problem with the park option and it goes haywire and continiously tries to park the drive and that is the noise you are hearing.\nhttp://disablehddapm.blogspot.com.au/2011/12/disabling-hard-disk-drive-advanced.html\nThe solution is to disable the power management, although that will decrease battery life. This worked for my drive but as you haven't told us what drive you have this solution might not work and needs a different parameter set.\n\nA: Add on /etc/fstab file, the following string at the end of mount options for your filesystems on HDD:\n,commit=600\nFor example:\nUUID=cc614fb7-fbdc-4b6d-af3c-a3fda4f699a0 /   ext4    defaults,commit=600    0       2\n\nreboot and\nenjoy\nman mount says:\n\ncommit=nrsec     Sync all data and metadata every nrsec seconds.

I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04, and I see that when using eclipse for editing source code, the bold characters displayed with the Monospace font are actually thicker than the non-bold ones. Thus, the Monospace font is actually not mono-space. (same space for all characters)\nIs this a known issue? Am I missing something?\nHow do I make it mono-space again?\n\nA: Monospace refers to all fixed-width font. There is also a specific monospaced font called Monospace.

At least Inconsolata has the same problem as Monospace.\n\nA: I'm having a similar problem with Monospace.\nAs a workaround I've switched to using Bitstream Vera Sans Mono which looks very similar but doesn't have the bold problem.\nIf you don't have it, you can install it by doing sudo apt-get install ttf-bitstream-vera.\n\nA: It appears that the font configuration in 12.04 sets Droid Sans Mono as the default monospace font (see /etc/fonts/conf.d/60-droid-sans-mono-fonts.conf), and as the OP describes, the glyphs in the bold version of this font have a different width than those in the normal version. \nTo change the system default monospace font, create /etc/fonts/local.conf containing something like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n  <alias>\n    <family>monospace</family>\n    <prefer>\n      <family>DejaVu Sans Mono</family>\n    </prefer>\n  </alias>\n</fontconfig>\n\nThis way, you won't have to remember to change the Eclipse editor font for every workspace you use.\n\nA: I had the same problem with OpenJDK 8. The font called \"Monospaced\" was correctly mapped to \"DejaVu Sans Mono\" for the \"regular\"/\"plain\" style, but something else (probably automatically bolded) for \"bold\", even if using \"DejaVu Sans Mono\" directly does the correct thing.\nThe solution is to fix ~/.java/fonts/*/fcinfo*.properties. \nIt did contain (among many others):\nmonospaced.1.0.file=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf\nmonospaced.3.0.file=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono-Oblique.ttf\n\nEverything was fine after changing those to:\nmonospaced.1.0.file=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono-Bold.ttf\nmonospaced.3.0.file=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono-BoldOblique.ttf\n\n", "Q: Firefox Unresponsive script after wake-up/resume Firefox is often unresponsive after waking up/resuming from hibernate/suspend on Ubuntu 12.04. After a while it will give me an error saying that some script is unresponsive and I get the choice to 'Stop' it or 'Continue' running it:\n\nA script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.\n\nI guess that Firefox doesn't like active scripts to be interrupted by hibernate/suspend, and thus freezes once I wake-up/resume my laptop. How do I resolve this, in order to make Firefox wake-up happy and snappy again?\n\nA: Try this:\nType about:config in the URL bar and look for: dom.max_script_run_time, Double click it and change the time to 20.\n\nA: Firefox is waking up and realizing that nothing has been happening for those running scripts for the past so many hours.  Additionally, if you're coming back from hibernation, the system is less responsive as it swaps all your programs back into RAM from swap space. It is rightfully notifying you that things have stopped.\nI usually just tell it to 'continue' and it gives everything  the extra couple moments it needs to get moving again after a hibernate.\n", "Q: Change menu item shortcut key like I used to be able to In 10.04 I had my system set up so that I could hover my mouse over a menu item and type a shortcut and that would be the shortcut for that item.

I never knew what Orchestra really was, I'd like to ask, MAAS is orchestra with another name?, if not, what are the differences?\n\nA: MAAS is the next evolution of Orchestra, based on past experiences and development on Orchestra.\n\nIt lets you provision your servers dynamically, just like cloud instances – only in this case, they’re whole physical nodes. “Add another node to the Hadoop cluster, and make sure it has at least 16GB RAM” is as easy as asking for it.\nWith a simple web interface, you can add, commission, update and recycle your servers at will. As your needs change, you can respond rapidly, by adding new nodes and dynamically re-deploying them between services. When the time comes, nodes can be retired for use outside the MAAS.\n\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu OS Having already installed Windows I am a user of Windows OS. Recently I came to know about Free OS and many other utilities offered by Ubuntu.\nI have downloaded Ubuntu ISO file and Windows installer and saved on my USB stick. Now what to do ahead.\nPlease guide\n\nA: Yes...\nhere's how to do it-\nWhen you boot the LIVE CD/USB for installation, you will get 3 options like the picture below-\n1st option will resize your windows partition and install ubuntu with it.\n2nd option will erase the complete disk and install ubuntu(YOU DONT WANT TO DO THIS)\n3rd option will let you select the drive/partition to install in.(SELECTING THIS IS RECOMENDED)\n\nThe procedure below is for option 3-\nClick on the 3rd option - Do something else.\nThat will take you to a partition table.\nIn the partition table you will see your partitions.\n - The 1st one will be c drive which has windows.You will be able to see it as NTFS file system.\n\n\n*\n\n*If all are NTFS,mostly the 1st partition will be C drive. \n\n\n\nkeeping the size of the  partitions different e.g 230 and 270 etc will help you easily recognize your c drive because there are no labels like c or d there)\n\nThen select from the other drives the drive which you want to use for ubuntu.\nGet some free space to install :\nCaution : Below steps is for deleting . Deleting a hard disk partition will make all files inaccessible everything in that partition, be sure to take back up if any.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select that drive(other than the WINDOWS c DRIVE) from the partition table and click on DELETE. That partition will be deleted and you will see unallocated space.\n\n\nCaution : Below steps is for formatting. Formating a hard disk partition will permanently erase everything in that partition.\nNow,you can either directly make the complete partition as EXT4 for installing Linux or you can also add a SWAP partition.\n\nIt is always recommended to add a SWAP area for better performance but only if your ram is below 8gb\n\nStep 1 : Create a SWAP partition\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the new unallocated space or free space, click on add.\n\n*Assign the space from that partition to SWAP AREA equal to double your ram.(e.g-for  1gb,swap area-2gb) But if you have large RAM like 4GB or 6GB you can assign 1GB as swap.\n\n*Select SWAP AREA from the file system drop down menu.\n\n*Make sure Beginning is selected in the partition position drop down menu.\n\n*Click on add.\n\nAdding root file system\nNow, after you have added the SWAP AREA,do this-\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the remaining \"Unallocated space\" and click on ADD.\n\n*Select Ext4 Journaling file system from the file-system dropdown menu.\n\n*Select Primary from the partition type drop-down menu. \n\n*Select the mount point as / from the mount-point drop-down menu.\n\n*Select beginning from the Position drop-down menu.\n\n*Click on add.\n\nAfter adding the partitions,from the table select the ext4 partition you see and tick in the corresponding check-box(if not already ticked)\n\nthen Select INSTALL...\n\nA: You have two options:\nInstall from Windows\nThis is good for a \"Testing out\" installation of Ubuntu.

Which type do you think is the most performant in my case ? \nI have an Intel i7 processor and an ubuntu 12.04 x64. \n\nA: \nI use a lot of computation programs which use many arithmetic calculations. Which type do you think is the most performant in my case ?\n\nThe low-latency or realtime kernels are NOT relevant for computation-heavy applications; their use is when instant response to events is needed --- think audio recording on one end, and the Space Shuttle on the other end. In fact, a very preemption-sensitive kernel (what all those you linked to are) can end up reducing the performance of compute-heavy programs (because of all the interrupts that are generated).\nIf this is a purely computational/server system which is NOT used (or rarely used) as an interactive desktop, what you want is a kernel compiled with the CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE option, the help for which says:\n\nSelect this option if you are building a kernel for a server or scientific/computation system, or if you want to maximize the raw processing power of the kernel, irrespective of scheduling latencies.\n\nYou can also try setting a lower timer frequency than 1000 Hz (the default), but this will affect interactive performance (mouse/keyboard movements, etc.).\nThere are many other options you can tweak in the kernel config to incrementally improve performance for computation, but doing an overview of all of them is beyond the scope of an AskUbuntu answer :)\nIn short: stick with the regular kernel if you also use your computer as a desktop. The gains to be had with tweaking are usually minimal -- it's not like it will suddenly improve performance by 25%.\n", "Q: Fn key is not functioning on SAMSUNG NP-RV513 laptop I cannot adjust brightness, Sound etc.. using Fn key in my Samsung NP-RV513 laptop.

The Ubuntu Software Centre shows that the package is available from the Universe software source. After I click \"Use This Source\", it gets stuck while \"Querying software sources\".\nHow can I fix this problem? It has occurred to me that perhaps this could be from software sources being deleted in my configuration. If so, can someone tell me the default list of software sources?\n\n\n\nA: You can try installing bleachbit from the command-line,if installing from the Ubuntu software center not working properly.\nOpen a Terminal window (press Ctrl+Alt+F2; or press Alt+F2, type gnome-terminal, and press Enter). Then run these two commands (type or paste them in and press Enter):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bleachbit\n\n\nA: I wouldn't even try it at this stage to put it on Ubuntu 12.04. It has got some issues and is not working properly. I updated my desktop PC and two laptops to 12.04 by fresh install and installed bleachbit on all of them. \nBleachbit would scan and do its job but as soon as it finished it would cause the PC to momentarily freeze then say there has been an internal problem with Ubuntu and it would send off an error report. This happened on the Desktop as well as the two laptops. There is obviously an issue there with 12.04 and Bleachbit. Every time I used it it would cause the same error. Not wanting to damage the operating system I Uninstalled it all three computers.\nHaving looked at other forums it appears some others are also having various problems with it. I will wait until a version for 12.04 actually comes out from the bleachbit website and I will try it again. \nI have used it previously with other versions of Ubuntu and it has worked OK with them.\n\nA: Restart your system and make sure you have added the Universe and source respositories. This can be done with in the Ubuntu Software Center located in the Unity launcher. \nAfter starting it you should go the the Unified Menu on the very top right, then Edit, then Software Sources. The second line ends with \"(universe)\" and the bottom line says \"Source code\".\nSelect both. You will be prompted for your password to make these changes. Close that window. \nYou should then be able to install the package.\n\nA: Go to the BleachBit web site, click on downloads, and get the latest version.  The web site always has .deb files for the latest versions of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: What is the equivalent terminal command of Update Manager? I have always been running the following command to update via terminal my machines:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n\nBut the other day, right after having finished installing some updates, the Update Manager popped up asking me to install some updates. I was puzzled as I have always thought the two were equivalent. I tried running the terminal command again: no updates. Then tried pressing the \"Check\" button on Update Manager: again some updates were available.\nMy conclusion is that the command above is not equivalent to the Update Manager, as I have always thought. So, what is the true equivalent terminal command of Update Manager?\n\nA: apt-get will NOT consider \"suggested\" packages as updates, while Update Manager does. It Update Manager also includes packages which apt-get would only install/upgrade with dist-upgrade. Additionally, I believe Update Manager maintains its own package cache which is only automatically updated daily and thus may not always be synchronized with the APT package cache. \nTo really check if you're missing out on updates, check the version of non-recommended updates Update-Manager wants you to install, and then do a dpkg --list | grep -i packagename to find out which version of the package is really installed on your system.\n\nA: You can use this command:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nman page says:\ndist-upgrade\n\ndist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages.\n\n", "Q: Is there a PHP 5.3.x PPA for 10.04? I currently have an OpenVZ VPS system running 10.04LTS, which I need a newer build of PHP 5.3 on. This is because I use PHP-FPM for all the virtual sites it hosts, and the Lucid build doesn't include this feature. I was previously using a PPA provided by the Nginx packaging team but they've recently discontinued it which leaves me with an old, buggy, vulnerable version of PHP.\nAre there any PHP 5.3.x PPAs which are still kept up to date? By searching Launchpad I've found several with version 5.3.5 but this is also terribly old, and I've found Brian Mercer's PPA but the description says that will be disappearing soon as he no longer needs to maintain it for himself.\nSo are there any PPAs which offer up a backported/upstream version of PHP 5.3.x (i.e. 5.3.13 which is current) including the PHP-FPM setup? Cheers!\nedit - I should further explain that as this is OpenVZ and the VPS provider don't yet provide a 12.04 template, I can't upgrade to 12.04LTS, at least not yet. So while this might be a long-term option, it's not an answer to my immediate question :)\n\nA: In the end, I found a PHP 5.4 PPA (at ppa:ondrej/php5), and decided to test that with the few webapps I run on that VPS. All seemed well (aside from vBulletin's upgrade system, but I have a workaround for that), so I've skipped the 5.3 series altogether and switched to 5.4. Probably won't be upgrading to 12.04LTS yet, although at least I now know that it's possible, and how to do it :-)\n\nA: Try:\nppa:zulcss/php5.3-lucid\nppa:igb/ppa-lucid-testing\n", "Q: Inheritable chmod permission from parent directory I have a directory named cache in /var/www, where I need to provide permission in following way:\nsudo chmod -R 777 cache\n\nbut that's not enough because PHP script automatically creates sub-directories under that for better file management like a, b, c... and so on. Now here whenever any new directory gets created it does not inherit permission from parent directory \"cache\" instead it stays with drwxr-xr-x access instead of drwxrwxrwx.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: This is the intended behaviour of the UNIX umask feature, which is used to control the permissions of newly created files.\nFor example, with a umask of 0022, the group and world write bits will be masked out.  This likely explains the results you saw with the directories your script creates.\nYou might be able to adjust the umask in PHP to 0000, but as this is a process global setting and the PHP interpreter is embedded in Apache, it might have security implications beyond your script.  The alternative is to issue a chmod() call after creating the directory, which should be a bit safer and doesn't depend on the umask setting.\nYou might also want to consider whether you really need to make these directories world writeable.  If the files need to be writeable by the web server and some other script, perhaps you could set the directory to be owned by a common group for those two environments and only make it group writeable.\n", "Q: Restrict access to my home folder from another standard user account I have made a new user on my machine to be used by my family.\nBut when I logged in to the family account which is not an administrative account, I could access my home folder(which is an administrative account).\nI want to restrict the access to my home folder from the new standard user...How do I do this??\nAnd I would also like to restrict that user from using the other NTFS partitions I have.\nIn short that account should have access only to its own home folder and not to my home folder or to any NTFS partition present.\n\nA: One way would be logging in as your user, open up a terminal (hit Ctrl+Alt+T), type\nchmod go-rwx ~\n\nand hit enter.\nLike that you deny the permission to read, write and cd to your home directory to anybody apart from you.\n", "Q: How to restrict access to a NTFS partition to a standard (non-admin) user?

As dixonck says, if you reboot into windows, turn Bluetooth off and on and restart without shutting off the laptop, and then enter Ubuntu, you will see that Bluetooth works. However, if you switch off Bluetooth or shut down the laptop, it will not work.\nIsn't a Ubuntu issue, is a Linux issue, i have tested it in several distros and it happens in them all.\nI think Sony makes a hardblock that completely stops the Bluetooth devices.\n", "Q: Plymouth boot screen not showing after enabling Nvidia drivers I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with Wubi, When I first installed Ubuntu I could see the splash screen with the blinking dots, But after a couple of days it vanished (I've Nvidia drivers installed).\nI searched around and found this\nEnabling Nvidia driver messes up splash screen\nwill it be safe to edit Grub as stated there(in Wubi installation)?, And will it work for 12.04?\n\nA: I don't know if this is the same problem that I had but I found this solution which might help you.\nPurple start screen - no splash screen\n", "Q: How do I install only Chrome on a minimal installation? It's something like Chromium-OS, however even more minimal.\nI was thinking, if it is possible at all??? \nThat I use an Ubuntu 12.04 minimal, just to install the base OS, and then on top of it only the chromium browser, without any GUI like gnome, KDE, etc.\nIf this is not possible, then is it possible to browse the internet directly through the terminal which comes immediately after installing the base minimal OS. I don't want to install anything except for a GUI browser (not the text browser).\n\nA: Just install Xorg, your graphic card driver, and Chrome. Then put Chrome in Xorg's startup script (.xinitrc). Though if you want something minimal like that you'd probably be more suited with Arch Linux, which is designed to let you build up your whole system from the ground (without too much effort).\nSome command line web browsers are Links and Lynx.\n\nI'm not sure, but this should be how to achieve it...\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install xorg chromium-browser\n\n*Install your graphic card driver. You can choose whether you want the open source or the proprietary one. If you can tell me what graphic card you have, I'll try to tell you which driver you need. The MESA driver should work with any card, if I'm not mistaken, but has terrible performance.\n\n*echo chromium-browser >> .xinitrc (Might be a different command. once again; I'm not sure.)\n\n*startx\n\nA: Use a minimal X configuration with a very lite desktop manager like Openbox, the following command will install the X server, the desktop manager and very little other packages\nsudo apt-get install openbox obconf\n\nyou can then call up a desktop session with startx and run Chrome inside it or modify your .xinitc to auto start a desktop session with Chrome running as a startup application.\n\nA: You can browse the Internet via the apps lynx or curl.\nsudo apt-get install curl or sudo apt-get install lynx.\ncurl|lynx www.askubuntu.com\n\nA: There exists lots of command line browsers.\nThey are lynx, links, elinks...\nSome command line download managers are:\nwget, aria...\nAll of these are available in ubuntu repository, and can be installed using apt-get install command.\n", "Q: Damaged swap partition - How and what to do? I needed GPartEd to format a MicroSD card (don't trust Disk Utility too much as more problems seem to occur with hard drives and memory cards I formatted with it, than with the ones I formatted wth GPartEd), and almost got a heart attack... There's a damaged partition on my new hard drive (a bit more than 2 months old)!\nLuckily it was only my SWAP partition, but still...\nI'd like to know a few things...\n\n\n*\n\n*How to rule out the possibility of hardware failure.\n\n*How this can happen if the problem's not hardware-related.\n\n\n*\n\n*I only installed Linux once on this computer (waited for Ubuntu 12.04 to get released), so it's not a SWAP partition that remains from an earlier installation.\n\n\n*What can be the cause of physical hard drive damage.\n\n\n*\n\n*The computer hasn't fallen of a desk or anything...\n\n\n*How to prevent this in future, if at all possible.\n\n*Additional: Whether it's normal that reading (and writing as well, I think) speed drops significantly over a minute time; and if it's not, what are some possible ways to analyse/fix the issue?\n\n\nNo problem if you can't answer all of my questions.\n\nInformation\n\n\n\nIt's a read-only benchmark.\nThe partition labeled Windows holds a Windows 7 installation I'm supposed to need some time for school, and I used before Ubuntu 12.04 got released. I have booted it up a few times after Ubuntu 12.04 was installed (I don't know whether Windows' disk check can do any harm to Linux partitions, but it always seems to run a checkdisk after I changed my partition table layout with a Linux application like GPartEd)./dev/sda7 is the SWAP partition I'm talking about.\n\n\nI guess my best option now is just try to boot a Live CD and format /dev/sda7 again? It won't format it from my installed Ubuntu system.\n\nA: Just a shoot in the dark, but IMHO your swap partition isn't damaged at all. I've already seen discrepancies between fdisk and gparted and, it's sad to say, but fdisk is almost always right.\nTry a:\n#> cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i swap\nSwapCached:        10632 kB\nSwapTotal:       2094076 kB\nSwapFree:        2053324 kB\n\nyou should see that your swap space is actually in use (or at least I hope so).\nThe explaination for that \"unreadable\" /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 partition is that cryptswap1 is actually a mapped encrypted swapspace, so it should be fine that no one can understand what's in there. If you want to disable it, you can look at this thread: How to disable cryptswap?\nLast but not least, your SMART status: at first sight (just watching the read error rate and the seek error rate), I'd have said that your drive was about to melt down. But, no, it's fine, I have a drive whose SMART says exactly the same.

I suspect that caching mechanisms make the disk appear faster in the initial phase of testing, and slower at the end. However I see that your \"worst\" read speed is around 80MB/s that is well above my \"best average\" read speed (around 60MB/s), so I wouldn't worry about this aspect.\n\nA: (Intended as a comment, but too big...)\nThe gparted error is just that it is unable to detect the filesystem (read: it is probably reading the partition data and trying to detect the filesystem type). \nfdisk is listing the partition table, just that, and there the entry says it's a swap partition (this has nothing to do with the filesystem, it's the partition type entry in the partition table, fdisk doesn't even try to autodetect the filesystem type). \nThe fdsik output you show mentions a cryptswap device, which, I assume, is an encryption layer over the swap partition. So that means your swap partition is probably encrypted. \nIf that's the case, then gparted is reading the swap partition itself, but will probably just find encrypted data that does not seem to be any usable filesystem nor a swap partition, because data there is encrypted and can only be accessed (in its clear, decrypted form) through that cryptswap device.\nAnd if the swap is in use, and the encrypted data is currently being decrypted at the cryptswap device, this also means the partition is in use, explaining the \"device or resource busy\" error.\nJust to check whether this is the issue, can you share the output of running in a terminal /sbin/swapon -s? And perhaps also the content of /etc/fstab?\n", "Q: Ad Hoc: Sharing a wifi connection in use? Say my laptop is connected to a WiFi hotspot.

I tried using Ubuntu 12.04 (amd64) Desktop/LiveCD (CD version). The text appears straight after trying to boot the CD, and it appears to not be rendering to the screen correctly. Possibly a graphics issue, since the laptop contains both an nVidia and an Intel card that is swappable with a soft-hardware switch, and in the UEFI/BIOS. Note: using the switch, and changing the UEFI/BIOS option didn't help.\nTried booting from USB, with no joy... but this could be because one of two things: Either a) the configuration used for the bootable USB drive I have*; or b) the fact that the Lenovo z570 has an (U)EFI BIOS, and this bootable USB was created (tested and working) on a regular BIOS (legacy) system.\nPlease look at the information I've provided below.\n\n\n*\n\n*I would like to know if it is possible to install Ubuntu to my system?\n\n*Why am I getting garbled text and how can I proceed?\n\n*Are there any specific changes I need to do?\n\n\n\nIf it helps, this is what I know about the laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contains a (U)EFI instead of a legacy BIOS. This is based on information found on the internet (e.g. Lenovo Forum).\n\n*Contains 4 partitons: 200MB (NTFS, System, Active, Primary), 654.69GB (NTFS, Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary, Contains Windows 7), 29GB (NTFS, Logical, Contains Drivers/OEM Apps, Label: LENOVO), 14.75GB (unknown filesystem, OEM Partition, used for OneKey Recovery).\n\n*Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit (OEM) is preloaded.\n\n*Despite using (U)EFI, Windows is preloaded in legacy mode! This is checked using a tool called \"bcdedit\" in Windows 7 which results in the \"Windows Boot Loader\" saying the path is \"\\windows\\system32\\winload.exe\", this should show \"winload.efi\" if it was booted in EFI mode.\n\n*The HDD is partitioned using MBR instead of GPT.\n\n\nSome of the Specs.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i7-2670QM (2.20GHz)\n\n*Intel HD Graphics 3000\n\n*nVidia GeForce GT 540M\n\n*CUDA/Optimus configuration graphics.\n\n*750GB HDD\n\n*6GB RAM\n\n\n\nSide Note: I have a feeling the CUDA/Optimus configuration is where the problem lies, however I must point out that I did change this in the (U)EFI/BIOS/CMOS from Optimus to UMA (or the internal Intel graphics card). Neither way allows me to boot the CD without the garbled text.\n*Configuration of the bootable USB drive:\n- Ext3 filesystem.\n- Bunch of ubuntu iso files (i.e. 10.04 to 12.04, both i386 and amd64) in a subdirectory called \"iso\". This is so I can install it anywhere, anytime, or to use as a LiveUSB on any machine for diagnostics, tweaks or fixes.\n- Grub2 bootloader.\n- Chain-loading the iso files (or iso loopback).\n- grub.cfg manually configured each time a new iso is added.\n\nA: Since no answer here was applicable to the solution I did to get it to work. Here is how I fixed it:\nReference: There is a forum post about this problem too, along with my responses. Found here. Also, the laptop I'm using is a Lenovo Ideapad Z570.\nWARNING: Flasing your BIOS may brick your device, or render it unbootable. Do this at your own risk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Grabbed the latest version of the (U)EFI/BIOS from the Lenovo support website. Link to the en-GB version for the Lenovo Ideapad Z570 here.\n\n*Flashed using the executable downloaded inside Windows 7.\n\n*Rebooted, and tried booting the CD again. No joy.\n\n*Opened the UEFI/BIOS using the F2 key. Picked the reset to default settings option.\n\n*Rebooted, pressed F2 key again, changed the boot order to: USB:FDD, USB:HDD, USB:CD, HDD, Network. Saved & Exited.\n\n*Rebooted, tried to boot from CD. Hurray, no more garbled menu! All options also now work!\n\n*Tried this several times, to make sure it wasn't luck, booted fine each time. All options always worked. Note: Error still shows up however that the prefix isn't set. Also, still couldn't boot from USB at all... but I think this is due to an incompatible device since the UEFI/BIOS doesn't detect it at all. The drive is a SanDisk Cruzer 8GB (SDCZ36-008G) for reference. This one is similar (the one I have is an older model though, but colours are the same).\nI won't mark this as a true answer until the other guys having the same issue can actually repeat this process successfully.\n\nA: It looks like the boot loader is having trouble with its fonts. You may be able to get started by just selecting an option and pressing the Enter key. (Picking the right option may be hit-or-miss, though; be prepared to try them all.) Since Ubuntu doesn't use exactly the same font code for itself as the boot loader uses, there's a good chance it will all work normally thereafter. The boot loader that Ubuntu will end up installing to the hard disk will probably not give this problem. If it does, you may need to switch boot loaders. (Fortunately, there are several available that will do the job.)\nOne more note: Before proceeding with Ubuntu installation, check the boot mode used by the installer. You can do this by checking for the existence of the /sys/firmware/efi/ directory. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode, and you should try to force a BIOS-mode boot instead. You might be able to do this by using firmware options or by removing the EFI-specific boot files from the installation medium. (For an Ubuntu CD, the easiest way to do this is to download the Mac version, which supports BIOS booting but not EFI booting.)\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my Ideapad P500 when trying to boot Clonezilla from DVD.\nWhat I did to solve it was simply switch the BIOS from EFI to legacy mode and then set the boot order as you normally would.  As soon as Clonezilla wasn't using UEFI, the text displayed correctly.\nWith the pre-installed Windows 8 machines, you have to get to the BIOS via Settings > PC Settings > General > Advanced Restart, etc. while it's in UEFI mode, so it's also nice switching back to legacy just so I don't have to go through 20 steps to access the BIOS.\n", "Q: Adding space to VMware Virtual Disk for running Ubuntu Server Guest on LVM Partition I have been testing methods for adding space to an Ubuntu Server guest running on VMware.  I have set up the server using LVM so I can add physical disks to to the LVM group and expand the logical volume on the system without having to shut it down.\nWhat I am testing right now and having trouble with is rather than adding a second virtual disk, I extended the existing virtual disk using the VMware client and it appears that it worked, but I cannot figure out how to get Ubuntu server to recognize the additional space without a reboot.  I have tried rescanning the scsi hosts using the command below as I would in order to add the 2nd virtual hard disk, but that doesn't appear to do anything.\nCommand to scan for added hard drive:\necho \"- - -\" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/scan\n\nAny ideas?  I am trying to figure out if this is possible so I don't have to keep adding multiple virtual hard drives every time I need more space and instead just make the existing drive bigger.\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: So just because it's a virtual machine doesn't mean it behaves differently from a physical server, hotplug is hotplug. If you have indeed added the device to the VM, and you've performed a rescan of the correct bus, then the drive should come up. First lets start with how to verify that the drive is there.\n\n~$ sudo lshw -short -c disk\nH/W path           Device       Class          Description\n==========================================================\n/0/100/1f.2/0      /dev/sda     disk           128GB TOSHIBA THNS128G\n/0/100/1f.2/1      /dev/cdrom1  disk           DVDRAM GT30N\n\nNote that I emphasized which bus to scan. The way Linux handles SATA is to represent each LINK as a scsi_host, so you can't just scan any old host, you have to scan the right one where your drive is attached. A little shell scripting will help here.\n\nhosts='/sys/class/scsi_host'\nfor i in `ls $hosts`;\ndo\necho \"- - -\" > ${hosts}/${i}/scan\ndone\n\nWait a few moments, then verify the disk is there, and then pvcreate and vgscan just as you normally would. That VMware didn't generate a hotplug event is their problem, I don't know how they implement that. QEMU assigns a PCI device per disk and piggy backs on that\nhotplug mechanism, no additional probing required. You should really consult the vmware documentation on guest management...\nhttp://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Hotadd_pci_devices#Add_a_disk\n", "Q: Where is the gnome-power-manager binary in 12.04?

I believe the facilities are provided by indicator-power.\nThe indicator-x things are threaded into gnome much deeper than gnome-power-manager was.\nIn case you need something with the same functionality you can try xfce4-power-manager\nIt is a little bit slow to \"dock\" in the tray, but works well and reminds me of the old power-manager.

When packages are downloaded, they have whats called a checksum. A checksum is basically a unique string that is created by looking at the contents of the package. This is created when the package is uploaded to the repos, and then your computer creates its own checksum when it downloads the package. Your computer then verifies that your checksum matches the repo checksum and if they are different, it won't install the package.\nI am guessing that it is an issue with the repo which would be fixed soon. In the meantime, you can disable updating of that particular package (called pinning or holding), so you can continue to install all of your other updates. The command to do this is:\nsudo su\necho oracle-java7-installer hold | dpkg --set-selections\n\nYou should now be able to run updates normally, and updates for oracle-java7-installer will be ignored. When you want to unpin the package and try again at updating it, just simply re-install the package:\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\nFor more information on pinning: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto\n\nA: I had this exact same problem and I followed the steps from this post and got it to work:\nhttp://rootzwiki.com/topic/23008-howto-install-java-7-on-ubuntu-1204/\n", "Q: Connecting to SSH/RDP/VNC through one machine? I am asked to come up with a solution for connection to ssh, vnc and rdp services in company firewall/proxy via one box on DMZ.\nThe task is to get users to connect to this one box and then to the service they would like to connect to.\nCurrently, I have one ubuntu machine on DMZ used for ssh. Users ssh to Ubuntu-DMZ and then to their target machine and the idea is to the same for VNC and RDP.\nThe solution should be open source/ubuntu where possible?\n\nA: This is very easy to achive using the localforward of ssh:\nLets say you have a host GATEWAY and a host RDPSERVER which is reachable from GATEWAY. You want to give your user access to RDPSERVER:5900 when logged in on GATEWAY.\nUsers log in to GATEWAY using\nssh -N -L 33642:RDPSERVER:5900 user@GATEWAY\n\nThis opens a port 33642 on the users machine, which is transparently forwarded to RDPSERVER:5900. So, user can fire up an RDP viewer, point it to localhost:33642 and all data will be encrypted and tunneld to GATEWAY and from there to RDPSERVER.\nOnce the user is logged in, he can check that the connection is up using\ntelnet localhost 33642\n\nIf you need several services to possibly different hosts, just add more instances of the -L parameter\nOn unix hosts, it may be best to distribute a ssh config file with the parameters. \nAs you can see, ssh has great features (and there is much more than localforward, check out remoteforwards and dynamic port forwards). \n", "Q: How do I access my ubuntu computer using vncserver/viewer? I have an ubuntu computer that I want to remotely log into using a vnc connection.\nSo far, this is what I have done:\nsudo apt-get install tightvncserver\n\nAfter downloading the software, I typed on the terminal:\nvncserver :78\n\nI assume the :78 refers to some sort of port that I open for VNC connection (i'm new at this, so feel free to correct me).

Especially in the special case of loging in from a windows computer to my ubuntu?\n\n\nA: Ubuntu also comes with it's own VNC server (called vino), which is easier to use (at the cost of being less configurable). Simply open up \"Desktop Sharing\" from your dash.\nThe :78 is referring to your display number, not the port. So, unless you have 79+ screens, you probably don't want to do that. :-) The numbering starts at 0, but 0 is the default anyway, so you don't have to define this when using vncserver. \n\n\n*\n\n*as jasmines has said, just use ifconfig to show your local IP.\n\n*You will need to configure your router to forward a port to your Ubuntu PC. The way you do this is slightly different on all routers. It does not matter that you are using a Windows PC to connect to an Ubuntu PC, it will not change the router configuration. That's all networking. Usually if you have a home router, it should be fairly easy to figure out by poking around in there, otherwise Google for your model.  http://portforward.com/ is also a good site with tutorials on many different router models.\nTo help you on your way, VNC by default uses port 5900. So you should have port 5900 forwarded on your router to your laptop (or some other random port forwarded to port 5900 on your Ubuntu PC) to allow access to your machine over the internet. You may also want to look at using a dynamic DNS provider, such as no-ip.com, so you can use a DNS name, such as myubuntu.no-ip.com instead of your public IP address (which will change from time to time).\n\nA: For local access you have to find out your local IP: \nifconfig\n\nshould help.\nFor remote access, you should port-forwarding your router IP on your machine local IP. You'll find many tutorials googling...\n", "Q: Can't get a working system from 32bit alternate ISO 12.04 Okay, so having some problems with this. As a newbie, this is black magic to me.\nI used the alternate 32-bit installation (via a live USB), and selected “Install” as the option. As the steps progressed, I chose the option of guided installation with encrypted LVM, and “no” for the option to encrypt the home folder (why bother if the whole drive is encrypted, right?). Later, I selected “Ubuntu desktop” as the type of installation. It asks me to install Grub (its the only operating system on the machine) to the master boot loader (or some such) and I have said “yes” – I tried that on one attempt, tried to specify /dev/sda on a second attempt (I hope I have spelt that right), but no luck. \nAll seemed to go just fine during the installation. However, on rebooting after the installation, the first problem is the screen. After the Dell startup screen it switches into its boot processes (I guess), but the screen goes dead – not black, it actually powers off. However, on one attempt I plugged in a second monitor, and hey presto, up it came on both monitor and laptop, and remained on the laptop when I unplugged the monitor. This is not a sustainable solution, but I can deal with it for now.\nThat dead screen actually hides the prompt for entering the passphrase for the encryption. So I do that, and we move on. If I haven't used the second monitor trick, the screen stays dead, although it does briefly flick into blank and black for a moment.\nNext challenge – its asking me for a login to the computer. I enter my user name and password, and we're through... to a command line prompt that welcomes me to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-24-generic-pae i686).\nThat “686” surprises me, as I thought that first “6” indicates a 64-bit setup? I was sure I followed the link to 32 bit, but.... So, I start again with a fresh installation of the 32-bit alternate ISO on the usb, and... \nstraight back to here, this prompt that does nothing. \nI can't figure out what to do from here. Help. (FYI, what I did looked very like this video http://youtu.be/V4Bje0sLblo)\nIts a Dell Latitude D420. \n\nan update (next day)\nWell, thank you very much for the help. \nFor the record, I had tried 'startx', and had no luck - it prompted me to install... grub, I think, and it didn't work then, either.\nThis time, I jumped straight to an installation of Lubuntu. I followed the guides, but this time selected 'manual install' after the core system was done. Went all the way through, rebooted, got the same login (after jumpstarting the screen with an external monitor again) and then ran the command lines as suggested by izx. \nWonderful! It now starts up just fine into Lubuntu. A little slower than I was led to believe, perhaps slower than a previous version of Linux Mint 12 I ran on it, unencrypted, but maybe that is the penalty for encryption. I have to install LibreOffice, Firefox (and Zotero) for work purposes, which are apparently 'heavier', so we'll see.\nmust now figure out how to get it to use wireless (sigh...) but the installation is in. \nThanks both of you for your help, and special nod to izx!\nB\n\nA: \nThat “686” surprises me,\n\nSave yourself the trouble, i686 is 32-bit :)  (anything that says x64 or x86_64 or amd64 is 64-bit)\nIf you chose the option to install an Ubuntu Desktop via the Alternate CD, just try entering startx and enter, to see if something starts up (I don't remember since I usually use the alternate CD to specifically install CLI systems).\nIf not, type sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y, followed by sudo apt-get install XYZ, where XYZ can be ubuntu-desktop, or xubuntu-desktop, or lubuntu-desktop.

I need to run an application automatically when Ubuntu starts. I've got this app running without opening the terminal. However, this application displays some information in a terminal window and, therefore, I need that the app runs strictly after opening gnome-terminal (automatically). To this end I've tried to create a script file in init.d as it is explained here. The content of the script is:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/mediambient/programa \n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e ./driver &\n\nThis works if I execute the file, but does not seem to do anything when I reboot the computer. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You cannot make a script that runs from init.d and displays a gnome-terminal window, because scripts in init.d run before there is any login session in which to display one. They run even before the graphical user interface is running.\nLogging to a File Instead\nIf you need to run this script when the machine boots up, then instead of trying to make it display text automatically, you should make it write its output to a log file. To make it run both regular output and error output to a log file, make the script as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/mediambient/programa\n./driver &>> logfile\nReplace logfile with the name of the log file you want to use. You might have that file in the /home/mediambient/programa folder, or you might put it in the folder for system log files (/var/log). It's your choice. Please note that the &>> operator will append the output to the end of the log file. If you want it to overwrite the log file each time, you should use the &> operator instead.\nRunning Commands from an Init Script as a non-root User\nPlease also note that scripts in init.d will be run as root. If you don't want that, but instead want to run programa as user mediambient, you can write the script as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/mediambient/programa\nsudo -u mediambient ./driver &>> logfile\nThis runs the program as mediambient but still records the log file as root. If you also want to record the log file as mediambient (which you should probably do if you're putting it inside mediambient's home folder), you can use:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/mediambient/programa\nsudo -u mediambient ./driver 2>&1 | sudo -u mediambient tee logfile > /dev/null\n(If you're interested in exactly how that works, this explains 2>&1 and this explains tee.)\n(By the way, please note that nothing in this script specifically requires bash, which is an excellent interactive shell but is a bit resource-intensive to use for init and background scripts. For quite some time the default shell for running such scripts in Ubuntu has been dash, which is much more lightweight. If you use #!/bin/sh instead of #!/bin/bash, that uses the OS's preferred shell for running POSIX-style shell scripts. For this script, it doesn't matter much, but it's a good habit to get into.)\nRunning the Script When A User Logs On Graphically, Instead of at Boot Time\nAlternatively, if what you really need is for the script to run when the user mediambient logs on graphically (rather than when the computer starts up), then you can make it run driver in a gnome-terminal window. You cannot use init.d for this; instead, you have to use the facility provided by your desktop environment.\nIf you're running a GNOME-based Ubuntu (with Unity, Unity 2D, GNOME Classic/Fallback, or GNOME Shell as your desktop environment)--which I guess you are, since you want to display the output in a gnome-terminal--then you can do this by pressing Alt+F2 and running gnome-session-properties. This gives you the opportunity to edit your Startup Applications. Put the following in the Command: field:\ngnome-terminal --working-directory=/home/mediambient/programa -e ./driver\nRunning the Script at Boot Time, Logging to a File, and Automatically Viewing the Log when a User Logs On Graphically\nOr you can (sort of) get the best of both worlds by putting the script in init.d to run when Ubuntu first starts up, and then automatically spawning a gnome-terminal window showing the output as it progresses, once mediambient logs in graphically. To do that, add an entry to Startup Applications with this command:\ngnome-terminal --working-directory=/home/mediambient/programa -x tail -n 512 -f logfile\n(Or if logfile is an absolute rather than relative path to the log file, then you can leave out --working-directory=/home/mediambient/programa.)\n-n 512 means it displays up to 512 lines of the log file from before it started displaying the log file. (It will then display each line as it is added to the log file.) This is usually a reasonable choice since a gnome-terminal window only remembers up to 512 lines by default anyway. If you run gnome-terminal with a modified profile that remembers more than 512 lines, then you can edit the tail command accordingly.\nLimiting the Size of the Log File\nIf you're concerned about the growing size of the log file, the first thing to do is figure out if this is actually likely to be a problem. You might just be able to estimate. Suppose the log file grows by one line per second (which is much faster than most log files) and each line is 80 characters long. Then in a month, the file is a little of 200 MB in size. In a year it grows to be about 2.5 GB. A couple hundred megabytes is probably fine and multiple gigabytes probably is not, so the question is, will you be able to manually edit the log file to clear it out, at least every few months?\nIf it's closer to one line per minute, then the file grows at a rate less than 50 MB per year, in which case you probably never have to worry about clearing out the file.\nThere are two simple ways to clear out the file. You can edit it and remove part (or all) of it. Or you can delete it, and let it be created again. If you delete it, it will continue to take up space on disk until nothing is accessing it anymore, which means you may need to restart driver. You'd also have to restart tail, but you can fix this problem by using a modified tail command that doesn't keep the file open:\ngnome-terminal --working-directory=/home/mediambient/programa -x tail -n 512 --follow=name logfile\n(I have replaced -f with --follow=name.)\nFor more advanced, or automatic, management of growing log files, you can use the logrotate command. The logrotate command checks to see if log files have exceeded their maximum size or age, and \"rotates\" them, compressing them into numbered archives (which are themselves eventually deleted) and making a fresh log file. logrotate will even send you email about the logs, if you set it up to do that. The logrotate manual page explains how to write configuration files to tell logrotate which logs to operate on.\nYou could run logrotate automatically from mediambient's user crontab. (A crontab lists tasks that are performed on a periodic schedule by the cron daemon.) The crontab command installs and operates on user crontabs. Or you could add an entry to the system crontab, /etc/crontab (which would be a reasonable choice if you're running the script in init.d and having it run driver as root rather than as as mediambient). Please note that Ubuntu's system logs are rotated with logrotate, though in Ubuntu's current default configuration, it is not called directly from any crontab.\nThis overview of log rotation with logrotate and task scheduling with cron should help you get started, but feel free to ask more detailed questions on AskUbuntu about these topics or, if you prefer, to comment here or edit your question to provide more detail about what you want to do (then I may be able to give more detailed explanations for how to do it).\n\nA: You have this written:\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e ./driver &\n\nThe & parameter which is at the end of the line means that the program is going to be hidden. This is useful for running background apps like web servers of boot sounds, but in your case you shouldn't use it.  The solution is as simple as removing it:\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e ./driver\n\nAnd I saw that you're not using GNOME for autostart. Use this instructions instead of the Server ones (replace google-chrome with the command above!): Chrome autostart on ubuntu\n", "Q: What are the pros and cons of CPU frequency control on a laptop? What are the pros and cons of controlling (lowering, or even overclocking) the CPU frequency on a laptop? How can I do it in Ubuntu and will it increase my battery life (as I never play games and stuff)\nAnd do fan speed and CPU frequency have any correlation?\n\nA: The trade-off is performance vs. both battery life and heat. As the frequency increases the processor produces more heat, and the processor uses more power the faster it runs.\nIn a perfect world, heat itself wouldn't be a problem as your systems fans would speed up to dissipate more heat--but this would consume even more power from your battery. Some systems aren't effective in conducting heat away from the systems circuits. In that case lowering the frequency can help keep the laptop cooler.\nPoorly controlled heat is a problem in two other ways, it can make the laptop uncomfortable to hold, but it can also reduce the lifetime of the laptops integrated circuits. Some systems will shutdown when they get really hot, but that doesn't mean the integrated circuits lifetimes haven't been shortened already. The operating range of the integrated circuits in a laptop vary and are set by the manufacturer.\nACPI (Advance Configuration and Power Interface) is the technology controlling heat and power in modern computers.\nThe acpi command from the acpi package can help control and monitor power and temperature in a laptop. acpi -t for example will give you its current temperature in Celsius.\nThe indicator-cpufreq package provides an indicator for the top bar on your system that will tell you how fast your processor is running and help control it depending upon whether you want performance or battery life at any particular time.\nObviously overclocking your computer will require even more power for both the processor integrated circuit and the cooling fans.\n", "Q: No precision specified for (float), WebGL I was looking into WebGL, and, to see if my system supported it, I went to this test page to see what happened.

When I've had that it has been because the basic clock on my computer, which is supposed to be set to the UTC time and then adjusted by the timezone mechanism, was set to local time and the timezone mechanism was adjusting my time to a later time.\nWhile ntp should be setting the basic clock on your computer to UTC time, it will refuse to adjust it if its not close, and 7 hours is nothing like close.\nI'd suggest that you set time clock to utc simply by issuing the ntpdate command.

How can I disable file indexing in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?\n\nA: Zeitgeist developer here, I would like to clear up things. (This is a bit of a geeky reply.)\nZeitgeist does not index files. There is no concept of file indexing or tracking. You need tracker for that. \nWhat zeitgeist does is log the events and the related URI for an event. In case you deal with files, the URI of the file is logged. The indexing service called FTS++ (code name) uses these URI and exposes an API which can be used to do a search on your file history.\nPlease note that this indexing service runs as a part of zeitgeist and does not deal with files. It just provides a full text search capability on the URI. This indexing service does not search inside the file or its contents.\nTo avoid logging and subsequent indexing, open Activity Log Manager and set the Switch of Record Activity to Off.\n\nA: The settings in System Settings > Privacy do not affect the results displayed in the Files & folders lens.\nEven after I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch \"Record Activity\" to \"Off\"\n\n*Check every box under \"Don't record activity for the following type \nof files\"\n\n*Clear all history.\n\n\nThe only way to prevent it from being displayed is to uninstall the lens: unity-lens-files.

Every time I restart the computer I have to sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyS0 to run any program that uses serial communication.\n\nA: This has been answered before.\nWhat you need to do is add the user to the default group where that port is located, e. g.:\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout ... /dev/ttyS0\n\nGroup is dialout. Add user to that group:\nsudo adduser $USER dialout\n\nReboot to test.\n\nA: \nI have to sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyS0\n\nThat's because udev dynamically creates the ttys on each boot. Without going into why your ttyS0 doesn't work by default, the brute-force solution is to simply add a chmod a+rw /dev/ttyS0 to your /etc/rc.local file (this way it's automatically executed on every boot.)\n", "Q: Is there a package for an executable version of v8?

I need to use windows!!! I installed both on c drive and didn't set a default. Not even ubuntu starts so now my laptops useless. Im on my phone now. Please help.\n\nA: Sounds like it's a hardware problem, rather anything related to software. Try to unplug power adapter and remove laptop battery, connect it back after couple of seconds, and try to boot.\nThere are some machines on which Linux will freeze, after a restart or a shutdown command is issued, right at the very end of the process forcing you to do a hard reset – press the reset/power button the system or plug the cord which is not good. In this post we will see how you can resolve almost 99% of freeze/hang that occurs during shutdown or reboot.\nWhy this happens\nThere are many reasons why this happens – some times it is an BIOS issue or sometimes it’s just that your system has a different kind of hardware setup, for example no keyboard controller, and Linux (the kernel) does not understand how to tackle that situation. Most of the time if it is a BIOS issue it is not very easy to ask your system vendor to give you an immediate BIOS fix that will take care of the issue and hence you have to rely on some kernel parameters that you need to pass to fix the hang/freeze issue.\nLet’s say you bought a new machine and you notice that your Linux distribution hangs at the very end of the reboot/shutdown process, upon giving any of the following commands:\n# shutdown -r now\n# shutdown -h now\n# reboot\n# halt\n# poweroff\n# Ctrl+Alt+Del\n\nSolution\nIn order to fix the issue, you should try one-by-one passing the following parameter to the kernel, in the form of reboot=<parameter>, at the time of boot:\nwarm =  Don’t set the cold reboot flag\ncold = Set the cold reboot flag\nbios = Reboot by jumping through the BIOS (only for X86_32)*\nsmp = Reboot by executing reset on BSP or other CPU (only for X86_32)\ntriple = Force a triple fault (init)\nkbd = Use the keyboard controller. cold reset (default)\nacpi = Use the RESET_REG in the FADT*\nefi = Use efi reset_system runtime service\npci = Use the so-called “PCI reset register”, CF9\nforce = Avoid anything that could hang.\n\nAs per my experience, one of the parameters (with the asterisk above) should be able to resolve your hang (or freeze) issue 90% of the time: reboot=bios or reboot=acpi.\nOnce your system boots you can verify whether the parameter was correctly passed or not by issuing the following command:\ncat /proc/cmdline\n\nOutput:\nroot=/dev/sda ro vga=791 quiet reboot=bios\n\nYou can find the list of all the above parameters in the reboot.c file in the Linux kernel source.\nBy default, the Linux kernel uses the reboot=kbd method i.e. it tries to look for a keyboard controller and issue a reset/shutdown command to it. But there are some systems like some of the Intel Atom processor based  machines that don’t have a keyboard controller and the above fixes are required. If you read the reboot.c file carefully there are some major main stream machines from Dell, Sony, HP, etc. that require the above “reboot=” fix. I guess sometime it is easier to fix the issue by using the kernel parameter rather than fixing in the BIOS.\nAlso you can also use the first letter (as denoted in the “[]” brackets) of each of the parameter:\nreboot=b        # for reboot=[b]ios\nreboot=a        # for reboot=[a]cpi\n\nand you can pass multiple parameter at the same time and Linux kernel will try in order specified:\nreboot=a,b,k,c  # for reboot=acpi,bios,kbd,cold\n\n\nCredit goes to Kushal Koolwal.\n", "Q: multiple monitors The machine was originally connected with two monitors and worked perfectly fine.

When using 12.04 laptop runs so cool and quiet but immediately I plug in, the temperature of the Hard drive starts to go up. (hitting 60•C in no time). However when I unplug the AC cable, the temperature drops to normal levels (45-50•C). What could be done to correct this? Thanks in advance \nHP PAVILION DV6700 \nIntel Core Duo 2.0Ghz\n4gb RAM\n250 GB HDD \nHere are pastebins of hdparm and smartctl on my ubuntu partition sda3:\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda3 (on battery)\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda3 (on AC)\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sda3 (on battery)\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sda3 (on AC )\n sudo hdparm -i /dev/sda3 (on battery)\n sudo hdparm -i /dev/sda3 (on AC)\n\nA: Here's the solution:\nlaptop-mode-tools is controlling power management for your hard drive, and you need to configure it appropriately for your situation.\nOpen /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf for editing with root privileges, and around line 276 (on Ubuntu 12.04), change this value to 600\nNOLM_HD_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=7200\nThis is the amount of time before your drive is told to \"spin down\" or idle on AC power. 10 minutes with no read/write activity is reasonable.\nAnd around lines 290-291 (on Ubuntu 12.04), change both these values to 1:\nLM_AC_HD_POWERMGMT=254\nNOLM_AC_HD_POWERMGMT=254\nThese set the power management level granted to the drive, with 1 being \"full\" power management, and 254 being \"almost zero\" power management. The latter setting is the reason for your temperatures, because you can set the level, but how the drive manages power at a level is entirely up to it -- it completely depends on the implementation in the drive's firmware, and can vary by model, manufacturer, etc.\nWith the changes, we are now telling the drive to perform the same power management it does while on battery (which is satisfactory for you). This is different from simply allowing the drive to spindown while on AC (as in @EliahKagan's answer), because that would still leave the drive's power management set to near zero at level 254.\nHow to determine power management level\nTo find out the current level, while on battery, AC, or any other situation:\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep Advanced (replace sda appropriately)\n\nA: Have you tried installing Jupiter?\n(http://www.webupd8.org/2011/09/jupiter-applet-finally-available-for.html)\nset it continuously to 'power on demand' or 'power saving', maybe that spins down the HD\nI have it on Precise Pangoling 12.04, works great (although i don't really have your overheating problem...)\nHope it helps\n\nA: I would like to request you to test this on some other version of Ubuntu (like ubuntu 10.4 or 11.04 or 11.10 - you can use live version of those distro). If the problem still persists, \nA. first check your earthing connection\nbecause improper earthing always leads to the overheating problem\nB. check your A/C adapter because it may be damaged and causing hdd over heat while plugging into the ac source.   \nc. Check your laptop battery a failing battery caused the problem with the adapter because it could be attempting to \"overcharge\" the battery, which doesn’t increase the battery’s charge, but, rather radiates the charge as heat energy (this is what is causing your overheating). \ni will ask you to remove your laptop battery and  then plug it into ac source in-order to check the battery. \n\nA: Charging your laptop battery generates heat.  So when you plug in your AC power, and your laptop battery isn't fully charged (it's previously been running off battery), it will start charging the battery, thus generating heat.\nThis is why you usually get the fan spinning up when switching to AC power after being on battery, and inevitably the system components will heat up due to the heat from the battery.\nThe hard drive, being reasonably close to the battery, will probably heat up a bit too.  This therefore is a plausible explanation of what you are observing.\nThere are other things that would cause your laptop to get warmer when it's on AC power, such as various components coming out of a \"low power\" mode, but the battery charging, IMHO, is a much more significant factor.\nYou say that your hard drive is \"overheating\" but only mention that it reaches 60 degrees.  In reality, manufacturers usually list 60 degrees as the top of the \"safe operating temperature\" for 2.5 inch drives.  Your laptop manufacturer will have designed your laptop's cooling system so that the most extreme situation (charging battery while stressing CPU, etc) should still cause all components to remain within their safe operating temperature.  However, they make a number of assumptions.  They assume that your room temperature is a certain value, that you're using the laptop on a solid, flat surface, its ventilation holes aren't blocked, etc.  If it's 28 degrees inside and you have the laptop on your lap, then components will exceed their safe operating temperature.  Similarly, if the fan fails or is blocked, then it will also.\nIt's also not unusual for laptops simply to run too hot because they have poor thermal design from the start.\nThe hard drive manufacturer will have given some \"breathing room\" in specifying 60 degrees as the top safe operating temperature, which will partially make up for non-ideal cooling situations.  That is, if you go up to 65 it shouldn't be \"too bad\".  You probably don't need to worry about imminent death of your laptop.  But any heat will reduce the life of your components and the cooler the better.  You should look into whether the fan is operating correctly, whether you're using the laptop in a hotter environment than a typical room temperature, and whether you have the laptop on a soft or warm surface or one which will press against the air vents.  If using the laptop on your lap, get a solid tray/stand for it to sit on.  Some companies sell these with built-in cooling fans which I think is overkill.\n\nA: To enable hard drive spindown even when running on AC power, press Alt+F2, and run this command:\ngconf-editor /apps/gnome-power-manager/disks\n\nThis will open the Configuration Editor and bring you directly to the options for automatically spinning down disks. Make sure spindown_enable_ac is checked as well as spindown_enable_battery.\n\nA: I've had this issue on 4 occasions, since having several laptops since 2007. It didn't matter what brand(Toshiba, HP, Dell, ASUS)\nEverything you're talking about is plausible.\nMy situation was resolved in the following way. As much as I have taken on board ALL the comments that OTHER people have also suggested, realistically all the 4 occasions were resolved after finding the one factor in all of them. When I replaced a NEW battery, the overheating issue wasn't a factor anymore. When I returned the OLD battery, YES I had what everybody complained about. In all 3 occasions I did the following; while assuming the battery was OK because I had often kept the AC connection plugged in, of course seeing the FULL BATTERY image made me feel the BATTERY was fine. It was easy to just go on with whatever I was doing. When I came across the issue with the hard drive overheating, I just happened to have a friend that owns a computer store that gave me a NEW or currently working battery(he tested for as reliable), then plugged that into my laptop. For THAT TEMPORARILY REPLACED battery, the hard drive OVERHEATING issue was pretty much non existent. Curiously, I replaced MY OLD battery that I ASSUMED was fine(because I LOVED to see it FULLY CHARGED), then I pulled out the AC adaptor to allow the laptop to run off the battery. NOW THIS is something that I OBSERVED in ALL 3 occasions, that allowed me to now SHARE this observation with you. In ALL 3 occasions, the battery RAN DOWN within the first 20 minutes(none of them went longer than 20minutes(ie 4minutes, 12minutes, 15min, 20min)) and the battery alert came up 7minutes remaining your battery is low. Basically the none of the batteries lasted as they would usually run for at least 2 hours.\nYES I also cleaned out the fan and blew out the motherboard of any dust. My friend has the laptop repair shop. Even keeping the OLD battery, the same issue would arise, the Hard Drive would overheat, while I had the AC connector plugged in, AND if I took out the AC connector, the battery did not last very long(in my case under 20minutes). \nTherefore, the issue was the battery that could not hold it's charge anymore. I had been keeping the battery plugged into the AC for about 3 years ongoing, & yes I also occasionally ran it on it's own without the AC while sitting on the bus or in the airport. BUT I MOSTLY kept it connected on the AC, like ALOT of people, FEELING the ASSUMED comfort that I was always 100% full power when something went wrong(blackout poweroutage in asia Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia). In the past I INITIALLY did what everyone else seem's to always bring up, clean the fan area, blow off the dust, check power settings, blame the hard drive. After REPLACING the battery, obviously because in all 3 occasions it could not CONTINUE past 20 minutes without the warning LOW BATTERY POWER. In my situation, which SOUNDS like what everyone is talking about, the battery was the issue.\nIs the hard drive LESS HOT when only on the BATTERY(not connected to the AC adaptor), YES in my case it was LESS HOT, whether it was on the NEW BATTERY, or even on the FAULTY BATTERY(that did not last longer than 20 minutes with the warning LOW BATTERY POWER). \nBut in ALL occasions, when the FAULTY BATTERY(assumed to be working well with FULL POWER STORED) was connected to the AC connector, the Hard Drive and generally underneath the LAPTOP area was OBVIOUSLY very HOT, then often would cause an automatic shutdown after some time(within 3 hours sometimes or after many hours under 48 hours). It didn't matter whether I had the AIRCON in the hotel room or a fan blowing directly on the laptop. The Faulty battery always appeared to have the issue with the UNDERNEATH feeling GENERALLY UNCOMFORTABLY HOT(hard drive area, cpu, memory chips).\nReplace the battery after seeing it not last very long like I did, then YES for the next 2-3years we MAY NOT have the same issues again(Max 4years). BUT I now know the symptoms of this after 4 occasions. I don't waste time, after watching the battery not last long on it's own. I just get a new battery. \nWill there be times that your AC ADAPTOR is at fault? YES, but in that case, your battery won't be charged fully, and you will see that it doesn't appear to be CHARGING the battery or show connected to the AC power. Replace that too in that case. Only cost $6-$8 in Asia, and lasted LONGER than the batteries. THose occasions I didn't have overheating. I just didn't see the battery being charged.\nHope this HELPS EVERYONE. \n", "Q: How to play piano via a midi keyboard? I am sorry to bother you but I don't know very much. This is about playing the piano through the computer. I have an m-audio keystation 88 which is a whole separate machine that connects through the usb cable that I got to work in windows xp with software from cantabile, I do not remember how but it does not matter because linux does not have cantabile. There are a lot of things like Midi and synthesizers and cards and jacks and controls and I do not know how they go together. A while ago I tried to get wine to work but couldn't do it. All the documentation I can find assumes you know almost all of the answer already. I don't presume to ask anyone how to do it but I do need something very simple to at least get me started. \n\nA: You can install a synthesizer from the Software Centre such as Bristol\nas well as a program to route midi commands from the keyboard to the synth, such as Jack Control.\nMidi can either go over two different protocols, ALSA or Jack and Jack Control handles both. Bristol, by default, uses ALSA. Jack Control opens several windows and can look a bit forbidding so you have been warned! \nConnect your keyboard the computer and start both programs. Click Connect in the main window of Jack Control, choose the ALSA tab and connect the output of your keyboard to the input of the Bristol by selecting each and clicking connect. You should be able to hear sounds now.\nOther programs exist that work with samples or soundfonts and may give you a more authentic piano sound.

When I'm typing a path in terminal that starts with an env variable reference, I hit tab to complete a word and it escapes the $ in the env variable reference.

That's quite important since it matters if it is an environment variable or not.\nBash will complete possible environment variables first if you started with a dollar sign, finally followed by filename completion. So if it couldn't find a variable to complete for you, it could have found a filename, in which case it will escape the dollar sign with a backslash since that's a special character.\nIf you started your command with a program followed by some variables, completion could be handed over to programmable completion, which could also cause this. For example, typing gzip $HOME/ followed by tab will insert a backslash. The files handling programmable completion are owned by the package 'bash-completion', so either you can uninstall that package (I don't have in installed), or you can convince them it's a bug.\nMaintainers: http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org/\nUpdate: on Arch Linux, I tried out bash-completion version 2.0 and that works as expected for ls $HO<TAB>, but not for ls $HOME/<TAB> so I guess they still not solved this bug (Ubuntu uses version 1.3).

I think there might be a user name or password problem, or some simple problem identifying my other computers.  I can't tell without more information.  \nIn short, sometimes my other computers appear on the list in the sync menu in software-center.  Sometimes they don't.  And when they do appear, I do not get a package list for the other installs when I click on them. \nWhen running software-center from the command line I get this message:\n\nsoftware-center 2012-05-23 13:52:06,630 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.app -\n  INFO - setting up proxy 'None' 2012-05-23 13:52:06,637 -\n  softwarecenter.db.database - INFO - open() database: path=None\n  use_axi=True use_agent=True 2012-05-23 13:52:06,854 -\n  softwarecenter.backend.reviews - WARNING - Could not get usefulness\n  from server, no username in config file 2012-05-23 13:52:07,237 -\n  softwarecenter.db.pkginfo_impl.aptcache - INFO - aptcache.open()\n\nI suspect the \"no username in config file\" is pointing to the key problem.

Hmm, no this doesn't seem to have any effect.   Still only the local computer is listed.  \nIt's strange because yesterday my other computers were listed before I clicked on the \"stop syncing\" option.  I can't seem to get them to come back up. \n\nA: This is an answer to the question about where configuration files relevant to the Software Center are stored. I encourage other users to post answers about what could be causing the specific syncing problem that the OP is experiencing ...or perhaps that should be posted as a separate question. Or, even better, reported as a bug.\nUser-Specific Configuration Files for the Software Center\nThe Software Center stores per-user configuration files here:\n~/.config/software-center\n\nIn that path, ~ represents your home directory.\nRunning cd ~/.config; rm -r software-center removes that directory, and then the Software Center creates a new, default configuration for your user account. If the problem is in the user-specific configuration of Software Center itself, that should have taken care of it.\n\nAnd my ~/.config/software-center/softwarecenter.cfg file looks like\n  this. Should it? \n[general] \nmaximized = False\nsize = 871, 536 \nadd_to_launcher = True\nrecommender_uuid =  \nrecommender_profile_id =\n\n\nThat looks normal to me. It is identical to mine (except mine has different size values, probably because we run different screen resolutions or use window managers; anyway the size field is irrelevant to any syncing or other package management problems).\nGlobal Configuration Files for the Software Center\nApplications's global (i.e., systemwide) configuration files are stored in /etc. The Software Center does not use any such configuration files.\nOther Utilities' Configuration Files, Relevant to the Software Center\nThere are other, lower-level package management utilities on your system, which are relevant to the Software Center. Problems with the Software Center, especially if they occur when using other package management utilities, may not be specific to the Software Center.\nIn particular, there is the command-line package management system APT.\n\n\n*\n\n*APT's systemwide configuration files are in /etc/apt. You should not manually remove those files.\n\n*APT keeps cached .deb packages and information about them in /var/cache/apt. (If you want, you can delete those with sudo apt-get clean or just the ones unlikely to be needed with sudo apt-get autoclean.)\n\n*APT keeps logs in /var/log/apt. There is no need to remove them--doing so never fixes anything broken, and they are automatically rotated. (That is, they are automatically renamed when they get big or old enough, compressed, and eventually deleted when very old.)\n\n*All these files are used or produced, directly or indirectly, by the Software Center also, which is in effect a graphical frontend for the APT system of package management.\nAt an even lower level, APT and the Software Center use dpkg to do the actual installation and removal of packages and obtain information about what versions of packages are installed and what files belong to what installed packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*dpkg has systemwide configuration files in /etc/dpkg. You should not manually remove those files.\n\n*dpkg keeps logs in /var/log/dpkg. Like APT's logs, you needn't ever remove these, as they are automatically rotated. Also like APT's logs, you can sometimes glean information about problems by looking at them.\n\n*Like with APT, dpkg is used by the Software Center and its configuration relates directly to whether or not--and how--the Software Center will function.\nThere are other services related to package management that run in the background, for example, to optimize the availability or usability of information about installed packages (apt-xapian-index), or to allow users to perform some package management actions as non-administrative tasks (aptdaemon). However, these are significantly less likely to be causing any problems you might see in the Software Center, so I have not detailed the locations of their configuration and log files here.\n\nA: this may help\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+bug/1008289\n/etc/apt/auth.conf\nI logged an issue as below:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+bug/1013619\nSimon\n", "Q: Ubuntu in USB.. Boot from fixed HDD? I am having Ubuntu 12.04 minimal installed on my USB pen-drive; which I use on several systems as portable OS.\nI was thinking to edit the boot parameters so that before the main Ubuntu OS is loaded, it shows an  option to Boot from Hard Drive for 5 seconds, and then boots to Ubuntu.\nThis way i'll be able to have an option to boot to the OS installed on the Hard-Drive, without removing or unplugging my ubuntu USB stick.\nHow do I edit the boot parameters to achieve this?\n\nA: This is actually a much more complicated scenario than it would seem at first, due to the annoying tendency that almost all BIOSs have of reordering how they present drives such that the drive you booted from is always the \"first\" drive, and that is also what some bootloaders (like the Microsoft's) expect (i.e. things won't work correctly if you try to chainload into Windows if it appears that the drive containing Windows is not the \"first\" as listed by the BIOS). You don't get this problem when booting from CD because CDs are treated separately from hard drives and don't change the order. There is also the fact that there may be more than one internal drive to choose from, so you should be able to select which of them you want to boot from in that case.\nTo add to this Ubuntu has a change to grub-mkconfig such that the GRUB_TIMEOUT setting in /etc/default/grub is ignored unless another OS is detected (with the idea being that if you don't have another OS, your computer should boot faster by not waiting on the grub menu unless you hold the shift key). The below solution handles all of these problems and I hope has enough comments that it's clear what's being done.\nRun gksudo gedit /boot/grub/custom.cfg and copy and paste the following into it :\n# Set grub's timeout to 5 secons. By setting it here we are overriding any\n# settings for the timeout in /etc/default/grub. This is to be sure that we get\n# a five second timeout even if Ubuntu's grub-mkconfig thinks it's the only\n# Operating System and disables showing of the menu.\ntimeout=5 \n\ninsmod regexp\n\n# Grab just the drive portion of $prefix, to determine what drive we booted\n# from.\n# The third parameter in the following command is a regular expression which\n# says to capture just the \"hdX\" portion of a prefix like\n# \"(hd1,msdos5)/boot/grub\". Note that the parentheses in the regular expression\n# denote what needs to be captured (like in  perl and most other regular\n# expression engines), they're not the parentheses that denote a device in grub.\nregexp --set=current_drive '(hd.)' \"$prefix\"\n\n# Loop through all drives (but not partitions)\nfor drive in *; do\n\n  # If the drive is the same as the one we're booted from just continue on to\n  # the next without creating a menu entry for it.\n  if [ \"$drive\" = \"(${current_drive})\" ]; then\n    continue\n  fi\n\n  # Make a menu entry with the device name of the drive in the title\n  menuentry \"Chainload $drive\" \"$drive\" {\n    drive=\"$2\"\n    root=\"$drive\"\n\n    # Swap the drive currently designated as (hd0) with the drive we want to\n    # chainload.

The default menu entry will remain unchanged, which means that Ubuntu should boot by default and you will have a 5 second timeout before that happens.

Please note that this is a per-user setting.\nThis is assuming your NVidia card is PCI, rather than PCI Express. Any NVidia card for PCI Express should be sufficient to the task of running 3D Unity, though it's possibly you'll need to install the proprietary drivers (using the Additional Drivers utility) to get that to work.\nIf you want more detailed information, you'll need to tell us the specific model of PCI NVidia graphics card you have.

You can recognize them because they contain ...ff:fe... in the middle of the last 64 bits. The rest of the bits is derived from your MAC address. Compare\nea9a:8fff:fe6d:6aaa\n\nwith\ne8:9a:8f:6d:6a:aa\n\nBecause some people are worried that making your MAC address visible on the internet would cause content / website providers to track your behavior by your mac address (and such behavior wouldn't surprise me, although they can more easily track you with cookies, browser-local storage etc etc etc) the privacy extensions were introduced.\nThe address containing 48c8:f262:ebe8:297b is such an address. That is the address that will be used to connect to websites and other outgoing connections. It will change over time to maintain your privacy and make you harder to track.\nBoth addresses are available for you to use. Outgoing connections will use the privacy address, unless configured otherwise. You can also still receive incoming connections on the MAC address based IPv6 address. This is all done to give you lots of flexibility. If you want you could add even more addresses.\nPS: another tool to see IPv6 addresses is\nip -6 addr\n\nIt will show you a bit more detail. You will see the word temporary after the privacy address, which indicates what it is.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Pandaboard giving me troubles I'm trying to install the OMAP4 extras for ubuntu on my pandaboard.

I am running Ubuntu One on Windows 7. I have a Synology DS212+ NAS drive that I would ideally like to back up to my cloud.

Is there a way to back up a folder from my NAS directly? \nAt the moment, I run a scheduled sync toy task to copy the folder from the NAS to the user documents folder, which then gets picked up in my nightly Ubuntu sync. This seems a bit of a hack.\nIs there any way of mounting the nas folder inside the user directory?\n\nA: Currently Ubuntu One doesn't support syncing from a NAS. Also, keep in mind that it's not a backup tool, because it preserves no history, and accidental deletion on your device will cause deletion on our servers!\nThe suggested mechanism is doing a backup, and then syncing the backup, just like you are doing.\n", "Q: With this way to set up Ubuntu, would I have to set up Windows again on my machine with RAID-10? If I have a Windows 7 64-bit system with RAID-10 and OCZ 128GB Synapse Cache drive for caching, will I have to totally redo my setup if I do a total install of Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: If we assume that you are trying to add Ubuntu as a second bootable OS along side Windows - then the answer is going to depend on whether that clever RAID-10 setup can be reduced in size and split into two partitions. Alternatively, on whether you can install additional drives.\nOne comment before continuing. RAID-10 is a very expensive option are you sure that you really need it?\nAnyway, the answer is that you either need to be able to reduce the size of the RAIDed partition and split it so that you can create at least one or two new partitions. Or you need to install a new drive (or 4 if you insist on RAID-10'ing everything for some odd reason).\nIn either of these 2 cases, you can install Ubuntu along side the existing Windows installation. In either case, it will be easiest to ignore the SSD for Ubuntu.\nThe one remaining difficulty will be where the Master Boot Record will reside. Assuming you have a reasonable PC with a good BIOS, you should be able to swap around the disk priority, in that case, it is easy if you have installed a new disk because you can make the new disk a higher boot priority in the BIOS and install the new Master Boot Record there. The Ubuntu install should pick up the existing Windows boot record and add an option to boot Windows into the Grub boot menu. If it doesn't you will need to look up how to add it manually - this might happen with such a complex setup.\n", "Q: Uninstalling Ubuntu partition I want to uninstall Ubuntu that I have partitioned on my hard drive. \nI want it uninstalled so that I can install the new version for Windows that allows for dual booting (alongside Windows).

Is that the way to go about it?\n\nA: I assume that you are planning to use WUBI from within Windows.\nIt's not necessary to uninstall Ubuntu from that partition. You can simply stop using it. It causes no difficulty to have several Ubuntu versions on one disk. In fact I do that all of the time. You should probably, simply, install WUBI and use that by booting into Windows at your current prompt.\nYou might want to make windows your default boot entry for your convenience.

You can get Ubuntu here. You can get older releases here.\nThen either burn the downloaded .iso image to a CD/DVD or write it to the USB flash drive, boot from it, select the option to install in place of other operating systems (which will remove the current Ubuntu installation), and let the installer run.

My Googling around leads me to think that your laptop uses a Mobile Intel 945GSE MCH coupled with an ICH7M (82801GBM) I/O controller. \nWhile the desktop version of the ICH7 supports SATA II, the mobile version, which is what I believe you have, does not. \nIn other words, transfers to/from your SSD will be bounded by the max SATA 1.0 transfer rate and will never be faster than ~150 MB/s. \nThe ~150 MB/s limit is from the SATA spec. In actual use, given that you have an Atom CPU, I would actually expect transfers to be noticeably slower than that.\nYou'd probably get better use out of your Intel 330 SSD in another system which could take advantage of its SATA 3.0 capabilities. An older SSD would probably work as well for you in your HP mini 2140.\n\n\nNote: by slow i mean 20 second boot to desktop (no login), 5 seconds to start terminal - was hoping that with ssd starting apps would be 1 sec\n\nThis is just a wild guess, but a large factor of the 20 second boot time could be due to the Atom N270 and the 533 MHz FSB not being able to move data any faster than they already are. Even if you had faster transfers to/from your SSD than SATA 1.0, the CPU and RAM transfers are (I'm guessing) still bottle-necking total system performance. \n(That's probably why the system designers saw no problem using an ICH7M. Faster SATA was not expected to result in a faster laptop. It would just cost more. Again, just guessing here.)\nI think your mini 2140 is just running as fast as it can. (BWTHDIK?)\n\nA: Yes, your machine is indeed limited by SATA1. That said, I think it's not really a problem at all. For a netbook you are getting very good performance and, many of the smaller random reads will fit in the slower speed range anyway.\n\nA: You could take a look here: http://www.howtogeek.com/62761/how-to-tweak-your-ssd-in-ubuntu-for-better-performance/\nI would recommend some IO scheduling.. I am using the \"noop\" option which is a lot snappier than cfq.\nEdit: Also a \"dmesg\" (by writing it in terminal right after boot) would be interesting to see. The log can show when different processes start and if something takes extraordinary time.\n", "Q: vgaswitcheroo not available on cold boot, only after restart I am running the new Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit release on my MSI CX420 laptop.

Sorry, but I am a  bit lazy to look up the exact line that you would need to put in your /etc/fstab but I hope this helps anyway.\n\nA: You may try to check kernel parameters while it loads (when you see a GRUB screen on boot) - if there is a nomodeset parameter, you must delete it.\n", "Q: Can \"older\" games such as \"Age of Empires\", \"Age of Mythology\", and \"Star Wars: Empire at War\" be installed on Ubuntu?

I had installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a separate partition, in ext4 format in my comp, which initially had only Windows 7.

Help?!\n\nA: If you've got an OS X installation, you should be able to get it to boot by holding down the Option key (or Alt if you're using a PC keyboard) when the chime sounds when you first power on the computer. You may then be able to reconfigure GRUB, install rEFIt or rEFInd to help select your OS for recovery, or otherwise reconfigure the system. Another option might be to try a rEFIt or rEFInd boot CD; that might enable you to boot OS X.\nThe GRUB commands you specified (set root=(hd1) followed by chainloader +1) are suitable for some types of recovery on a BIOS-based system, but the invalid efi path error you got suggests that GRUB is installed in EFI mode, not in BIOS mode. It's not clear what you were hoping to accomplish with those commands (what OS you intended to boot), but the equivalent for EFI is likely to be to load another OS's boot loader and chainload to it, as in:\nset root='(hd0,gpt2)'\nchainloader /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\n\nThis example might boot OS X, depending on where it's installed. Details will vary depending on your installation, of course.\nIf you need more help, I recommend you run the Boot Info Script from an emergency disc and post a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it produces.

I just upgraded to 12.04 and although everything worked fine after install, before I added the b43-fwcutter driver, once I installed the driver, the system refuses to boot.  Even before I install the Linksys card!!  It just hangs on boot with graphical garbage on the screen.  I tried several attempts to recover the system using the live CD, and finally reinstalled completely.  I have been thru the cycle, install fresh system, verify everything works, then install b43-fwcutter and it is hung, several times.  Consistent hard fail.  \nThe system runs fine on hardwire Ethernet, and wireless was fine on 10.04.  But I cannot get there with 12.04.  So after several attempts, I am now ready to admit defeat and ask for help.\nI have read every thread that search turned up, and either the advice is to do what I did, i.e. install fwcutter, or does not apply (Different Broadcom, STA, legacy, whatever)\nSo what do I need to do to fix it?  Or is the B43-fwcutter driver broken for 12.04?\nThoughts?  Tips?  Log files needed??\n\nA: SOLVED!  This was a multifaceted problem.  First my own unfamiliarity with Grub did not let me recognize that Grub was trying to tell me something but it's incorrect video setting was just showing garbage.  Reconfiguring Grub solved that.  Second, something bogus was installed that was conflicting with the card, causing it to be activated even with no b43 driver installed, and it was then hanging the system.  I removed several things I could not identify and then suddenly I could get it to run, with complaints that the firmware was not installed.  I am not sure exactly what I removed that got around the problem.  Then I installed the firmware per the standard instructions here and is all started working.  Note I had installed the firmware before but it didn't work, since the bogus something or other was hanging things up.  It is working now, and I am posting this answer over the Wifi link.

Before anyone jumps the gun and votes to close this, I am not asking how to make it \"see-through\", which you can adjust in CCSM by setting the Opacity to 0%.\nI'm asking the following: How can you make the launcher COMPLETELY transparent?\n\nI have both the Launcher and Top Panel set to 0%. As you can see, the Top panel is completely transparent. But, the Launcher is...well, not. Even though I set it to 0%, it is far from transparent.

On booting my computer, I see multiple entries in my GRUB menu such as memtest, various Ubuntu versions and a corresponding recovery option. What does memtest mean and why are there a lot of Ubuntu entries? Does one differ from the other?\n\nA: Memtest\nMemtest is for testing your system's RAM for errors.  Very useful if your computer starts crashing and there is no software explanation.\nUbuntu kernels\nThe multiple Ubuntu entries are for the multiple kernels you have installed.  Kernels are the core of every Linux system; they are what allow your operating system to use your computer's hardware.  New kernels generally improve compatibility with new hardware and fix security vulnerabilities but sometimes there will be a regression--hardware that used to work no longer works with a new kernel--and therefore Ubuntu keeps some old kernels and Grub allows you to boot into an old kernel in case the new one has a regression.\nOther Operating Systems\nIf you have other OSes on your system (from Windows to other flavors of Linux to whatever) chances are Grub will detect them and list them as well.  Other versions of Linux will also likely have multiple kernels displayed.\nRecovery mode\nThere will also be a recovery option for every kernel. You can use this in case anything ever goes wrong with your system and you can't boot up normally.  Recovery mode loads the file system in read-only mode and then offers you these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*resume (resumes into normal mode, sometimes a full reboot will be required to get full graphics capabilities)\n\n*fsck (remounts your filesystem in read/write mode and checks the filesystem, fixing any errors - useful for checking for and fixing filesystem errors that are preventing a normal boot, if you can't even boot into recovery mode you can also use a live CD/USB for this\n\n*clean (Tries to create freespace by cleaning the apt cache and auto-removing unneeded packages, if your disk is so full you can't even boot up normally, chances are you'll need to remove more than this, but this is a start at least)\n\n*apt-snapshots (I've never used these, but in theory if you use apt snapshots this will let you resume to a previous one)\n\n*failsafeX (This boots into a failsafe graphics mode)\n\n*grub (This runs update-grub, which I can't really see why if you could use grub to get into recovery mode you would need this.... but it will run all of grub's auto-detection scripts so it could be useful)\n\n*network (Tries to enable networking)\n\n*system-summary (Gives you information about your system, specifically (file)System mode, CPU information, Network connectivity state, Detailed disk usage, Software RAID state, LVM state, Detailed memory usage, Detailed network configuration info, and System database (APT) state)\n\n\nand finally, the most important and useful option:\n\n\n*\n\n*root (which will drop you to a root prompt where you can diagnose and fix just about any (fixable) problem with your system with enough time and patience - note that your filesystem is still mounted in read-only mode so you will need to remount it with write access to make changes)\n\n\nThese might be out of order, I didn't actually reboot and look at the menu I just got the options from the scripts (stored at /usr/share/recovery-mode/) Hope this helps!\n\nA: There are three kinds of entries in my system, (dual booting Ubuntu with Windows 7).\nThe first two entries are for your Linux system: \n\n\n*\n\n*First one is the Normal boot entry, it boots your Ubuntu system with normal graphics mode, loads all necessary modules, display boot splash etc.  \n\n*Second one is for recovery options, It normally does not load the modules, (sometimes disables full graphics support, only access to Unity 2d). It gives you options to clean your system, reset password, give a chance to access on root user to fix problems, give a chance to fix dependency problems etc.  \n\n*Third one loads Windows 7\n\n*memtest options are used to inspect any memory problems you have.\n\n\nHope this will help.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Business Desktop Install file too large - 834Mb My blank CD's are only 700 MB, and the .iso file I downloaded is over this.

My motd persistently has:\n*** /dev/sdb1 will be checked for errors at next reboot ***\n\nThe problem is that I don't have /dev/sdb1 on my system.\nI only have /dev/sdb2 (mouted as /) and /dev/sda1 which mounts to /media/backup.

Can you manually fsck the drives from single-user mode (e.g., by booting into recovery mode)?\nYou can do a sudo mv /var/run/motd /var/run/motd.old to force a clear of the current /etc/motd file.   \nAlso, can you add output of your from cat /etc/fstab ?\n\nFor swap operations, see these answers:\ndelete old swap partition \nHow to delete a second swap partition safely?\nA nice graphical swap repair guide using gparted is here.\n\nA: Looking for help on the same issue, and the search that brought me here.\nI came across this forum discussion Ubuntu Forums which posed the following command as solution:\nsudo touch /forcefsck\n\nI tried it and the message was cleared on next reboot. Some have commented that this does not always work, but I hope it helps you too.\n\nA: From: Persistent \"disk will be checked...\" in the message of the day (motd) even after reboot\nThis is caused by a stuck file. The timestamp on /var/lib/update-notifier/fsck-at-reboot is in the future, causing it never to be regenerated. \nTo fix the problem, remove that file and then reboot.  \nYou can fix it without rebooting by forcing the motd file to be regenerated after removing the stuck file.  \nHere is the command to remove the stuck file and regenerate it through the update-motd system:\nsudo bash -c 'rm /var/lib/update-notifier/fsck-at-reboot && for file in /etc/update-motd.d/*; do $file; done > /var/run/motd' && cat /etc/motd\n\nOr alternately, with run-parts instead of the for loop:\nsudo bash -c 'rm /var/lib/update-notifier/fsck-at-reboot && run-parts /etc/update-motd.d | tee /var/run/motd'\n\n"]
