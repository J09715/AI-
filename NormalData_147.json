["Q: Availability of packages on ubuntu LTS How can i know what packages are available for the Ubuntu LTS. My host says that PHP 5.4 is not supported because it is currently not available on the LTS repo for Ubuntu 12.04. How can I find out if it exists or not? Is there a webpage that I can use to search the availability of a package for the LTS\n\nA: Yes, you can search on http://packages.ubuntu.com. Make sure to select (filter) on the precise (12.04) distribution.\nAlternatively, check the availability of packages using your package management, e.g.:\n$ apt-cache policy libapache2-mod-php5\nlibapache2-mod-php5:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6\n  Version table:\n     5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 0\n        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/main amd64 Packages\n     5.3.10-1ubuntu3 0\n        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: http://packages.ubuntu.com/php5\nLook for \"precise\".\nOnly PHP 5.3.10 is available for Ubuntu 12.04.\n", "Q: How to pass text file contents as argument to console application?

With double quotes to pass all the text as a single argument:\n./myapp \"$(cat text_file)\"\n\nOr, using the older form with backticks ` `:\n./myapp \"`cat text_file`\"\n\nYou can run without quotes to have the shell split and expand (if wildcards are present) the text:\n./myapp $(cat text_file)\n./myapp `cat text_file`\n\n", "Q: How can see find process that have pages swapped out?

The process of getting this line added to /etc/default/grub is the same as LiveWireBT stated.

My understanding of rc.local, based on a quick Google search, is that I can put some bash in it which will be run at the beginning of [something] (what, user login, system start up?).\nThe rc.local in my Ubuntu 12.04.2 server is owned by my user, orokusaki, vs being owned by root. Because it's in /etc, I'm guessing it's more of a global thing vs a user-specific thing. Is this true? If so, why did Ubuntu create it with my orokusaki user, but then put it in etc? Should I chown root:root /etc/rc.local to fix it, or should I move it into my home directory?\n\nA: On Ubuntu 12.04, your rc.local should be owned by root. It's run by root, on startup.\nYou can sudo -u <user> <command> to run things as another user in rc.local, but I admit that in nearly every single case of using rc.local I've come across, I've found it far simpler to use Startup Programs instead.\nI suppose your mileage may vary.

When I type google-chrome in the terminal it works. xdg-open google-chrome doesn't.\nWhy is this so? I need to do this so that I can run Chrome without keeping the terminal open, which xdg-open google-chrome allows me to do.\n\nA: XDG-open is for opening the \"right\" application for the file type. In your case you like to run the application google-chrome in the background - XDG-open is not used for this purpose.\nInstead, use your shell (assuming Bash here) to have the program run in the background:\nnohup google-chrome &\n\nExplanation: appending & makes it run in the background (you'll get your shell back) while nohup will keep the application open (disowns).

You don't mention the version of Ubuntu you are using, so I will describe how to add polytonic Greek on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS which I'm currently using.\nSelect the System Settings icon from the dash. Alternatively click dash-home and type 'System settings', then click on the icon presented to you. \nOn the window that has appeared, in the hardware section, you will notice a keyboard icon. Click on that. The content changes and at the bottom you will notice a link \"Layout Settings\". Click on that. Again the contents of the window change.\nOn the bottom left you will notice a \"+\" sign. Click on that and you will be presented a selection dialog. Type Greek in the search field to narrow down the presented options. Now select \"Greek (polytonic)\" and click Add. You are done.\nIf you want you can manage some options and behavior of the new layout by clicking on it and then clicking Options. When done, close the window. You don't need to reboot or re-login for the changes to take affect. Ελπίζω να βοήθησα. ( If this is Greek to you, I just wrote that I hope this was helpful :-) )\n\nA: You can also use Ibus, which IMHO works a little better than using the keyboard layout when adding the diacritics.\nIbus is installed with 12.04. You need to also install ibus-m17n  for polytonic Greek support. This should work with any Unicode font, but you may want to install a specialized free font that is guaranteed to have all of the needed glyphs, such as Galatia SIL .\nAfter installing these packages, log out and in again.\nFor instructions on setting up ibus, see this answer. While it's on a slightly different topic, it has full instructions for selecting Ibus as the system imput method  and adding an input method. The Ibus m17n method is called is called Greek, Ancient (to 1453)\nTo add a rough breathing, for example, it's letter + ` (backtick). You shouldn't need to change any key mappings, but if you want to you can change them through the preferences in the language panel. (See the answer linked above for making sure the language panel shows.).\n\nA: Its as easy to do as in Lubuntu.  Click on System Settings, and click on Keyboard Layout:\n\nClick on the \"+\" sign to add a layout\n\nSearch for the language you want, in this example Greek, and add it\n \nLook at the keyboard layout icon, and you will see the new language.  Just click it to choose it.\n\n\nA: Look in my case I had HP OMEN so the input coming for @ was \" instead and some other minor changes.\nLook it's simple, you just go to Settings->Region and language (you just type \"layout\" on the search tab of ubuntu and you would directly land there)->In the input sources you would see English(UK) would have been in use, just click + to add English(US) and the then delete English(UK).\nNow your laptop should just work perfectly fine!! \n", "Q: How to open SD card from terminal?

Or how do I make it show up next time I insert the card?\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.10 onwards, the mount points are to be found in:\n/run/user/$UID/gvfs/\n\nA: The easiest GUI way to see this is to just run the Disks program and all mounted disks will show up. SD cards looked like /dev/mmcblk followed by a single integer, a p for partition, and another single integer for partition number.\nIf the SD card is not already setup in /etc/fstab, let's say your username is jim (like mine), it will mount under /mnt/jim/ where UUID is the unique disk identifier.\nYou don't need to be root or have sudo access to run blkid and look through the list to see what your SD card's UUID is, like this:\n\n/dev/mmcblk0p2: UUID=\"2fa2f9f1-0c50-42e6-9e05-3cc5a3421c38\" TYPE=\"ext2\"\n  /dev/mmcblk0p3: UUID=\"83bcffea-4c41-4860-8965-970c5f3e90b4\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nTo see whether it's actually mounted, use mount with no options, you'll get a listing like this:\n\n/dev/mmcblk0p2 on /media/jim/2fa2f9f1-0c50-42e6-9e05-3cc5a3421c38 type ext2 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks2) \n/dev/mmcblk0p3 on /media/jim/83bcffea-4c41-4860-8965-970c5f3e90b4 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks2)\n\nThere is of course the chance that your SD card is not formatted in a way that Ubuntu can read it, if you have sudo access you can run gksudo gparted for a gui-based disk manager that's a little more powerful than Disks.\nYou say you need to put files ON the SD card so in theory you will want to format it if necessary.\nThe comment that suggests using the mount command may not auto-discover the file system type in which case you have to add -t filesystemtype, check this page for more than you ever wanted to know about file systems: Linux File Systems Explained\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu still brick certain devices? I read previously on other threads that installing ubuntu on some newer machines can cause the problems with the bios, where 'Ubuntu' will write over the bios, and cause the machine to end up being a brick.\nHow do I know if I'm safe?\n\nA: You're getting a bit mislead here.\nThe problem was with certain systems that use UEFI.

I want to upgrade to 13.04 but I dont know if something will be deleted ...\n\nA: Nothing except for system files should be deleted or modified. Some programs might not be updated (due to the package manager disabling 3rd party repositories), but you shouldn't have any other issues.\n\nA: I had some problems upgrading via Terminal form 12.10 to 13.04.

At first i wanted to ask for clarifications, but i've read this is to be avoided, so my only option was to open another question.\nI'm running kUbuntu 13.04. My bios does support AHCI and i have specifically enables hotplug for the SATA port that links to my eSATA bay. My eSATA dock has a power button.\nStarting seems easy enough. If i plug a disk in the bay, then power it up, the disk will mount automatically as a \"fuseblk\" disk (at least for the one i tested, looks like it's how an NTFS disk is reported)\nHowever, i would like to know how i can stop the disk without stoping the computer, possibly to mount another disk, all of this while avoiding data loss and physical disk damage, and preferably in an (semi) automated way so i don't have to open my command line every time.\nWhat i've found so far :\n\n\n*\n\n*sdparm doesn't seem to be of any use, even thought it should be the right tool (disk is /dev/sda), but sdparm -C stop does nothing\n\n*hdparm on the other hand does work to put the disk to sleep sudo hdparm -Y /dev/sda will have the disk stop spinning. However, the disk is still mounted as reported by mount -l\n\n*sudo echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/delete will give me a permission refused error (even though i used sudo)\n\n*there is an \"eject\" icon if i right click the disk in Dolphin that will unmount the disk, but the disk won't stop spinning (and i sure don't want to physically remove a spinning disk)\n\n\nSo currently, i unmount the disk using the \"eject\" button, then put the disk to sleep. However, i don't know enough of the HDs management to be sure \"sleep\" is enough. Is there no real \"stop\" or \"power off\" command? When the OS is going to shutdown, does it simply put the drives to sleep and is it enough to allow safe handling.\nAlso, when following those steps and then switching to another disk, the disk will sometimes appear as /dev/sde rather than /dev/sda, wich leads me to believe there are some resources that are not correctly freed. Maybe this is precisely the point of the sudo echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/delete command, but as i can't run it, even with a sudo, it's not really helpful.\nIs there any other command i should be aware of, and add to the sequence?\nAs for making this automatic, i guess i can make a shell script, but what if i have a multi partition disk. Using umount /dev/sda1 won't unmount other partitions, and i don't think it's possible to unmount using only /dev/sda is it? Would it work with /dev/sda*? Currently the only multi partition disk i have under hand is my system disk, so i can't try to unmount it and see what happens.\n\nA: You'll have to combine all the elements in the right order in case you're coming from the situation of a spinning disk which contains a volume being mounted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount all volumes on this disk, e.g.:\nsudo umount /path/to/mount/point\n\nVerify it's unmounted using grep sda /proc/mounts. Repeat for other volumes on the physical disk.\n\n*Stop the drive, e.g.:\nsudo hdparm -Y /dev/sda\n\n\n*Tell the SATA controller you'd like to unplug it:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/delete\"\n\n", "Q: sudo apt-get update does not work?

I am using Ubuntu on my Nexus phone and I would like to know where I can find updates to what is changing on the device so I can follow along with development.\n\nA: Ubuntu Touch generally follows a separate release schedule than the standard Ubuntu desktop and therefore information about its releases are published separately.

There's a section for LAMP applications in it.\nSince you're new to Linux and Ubuntu in general, there's an excellent guide called the Ubuntu Pocket Guide. I read this when I was beginning with Ubuntu (as a normal desktop user though) and it was extremely helpful.\n\nA: There are a couple of good books available through Amazon for admin of Ubuntu Server. I have The Official Ubuntu Server Book and it's pretty good; also there is Ubuntu 12.04 Server: Administration and Reference which would help.\nI would recommend using the 12.04 Server LTS release.

One of the features in particular is being able to add windows programs to the dock in OSX. \nI mostly use Virtualbox/Parallels for AutoCAD, SolidWorks, and Qucik books. So what I would like to do is be-able to install AutoCAD for example in virtual box, and then make a shortcut directly to AutoCAD and place it on the Ubuntu Panel right along with the rest of my Ubuntu Apps. So basically if I click on the AutoCAD icon in my Ubuntu panel, it will open virtual box in seamless mode and automatically launch AutoCAD, or If I click SolidWorks, it will automatically open in seamless mode, and auto launch SolidWorks, etc...\nThis is by far one of the best features in Parallels desktop for Mac and I would be great to beable to reproduce this function in virtual box. Also, I know they have or had, im not sure, Parallels Desktop for linux, but it doesn't have the same features as it does in OS X, at least thats what I understand.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Guest Additions\n\n*Enable seamless mode\n\n*Shutdown the VM\n\n*Create a simple bash script, placing this into it (reference):\n#!/bin/bash\nVBoxManage startvm \"VM_NAME\"\nVBoxManage guestcontrol execute \"VM_NAME\" \"exec_command\"\n\nReplace VM_NAME with the name of the VM and exec_command with the command you want to run.\n\n*Save this file somewhere, give it execute permissions, write a .desktop file for it, then sudo move that to the /usr/share/applications folder.\n\nNote: My preferred way to make a .desktop file is like this:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\nsudo -H gnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new \"/usr/share/applications\"\n\nThen fill in the fields with the path to your script as the command, this will place a .desktop file in the /usr/share/applications folder (more info)\n\nA: Here is a possible work-around, if you are willing to create three separate virtual machines, one for each program, then...\n\n\n*\n\n*In the first virtual machine, set AutoCad as a Start Up application.\n\n*In the second virtual machine, set SolidWorks as a Start Up application.\n\n*In the second virtual machine, set QucikBooks as a Start Up application.\n\n\nThen, right click on each virtual machine ans in VirtualBox Manager, and select \"Create Shortcut on Desktop\".\nTo save space, you don't have to make each virtual disk (*.vdi) very large, because, you can setup a common shared folder on your host machine to store all your files from all three applications.\nAdditionally, you could clone your existing virtual hard disk, so you don't have to reinstall everything two more times.  Use VBoxManage clonevdi current_hard_disk.vdi new_hard_disk.vdi.\n", "Q: What should i choose? LXC vs OpenVZ As an alternative to Virtualizing several Ubuntu Servers im looking into the possibility of using containers. But I am not sure if I should go for OpenVZ or LXC. Can anyone recommend one of them, or maybe list pros and cons? \n\nA: From what I can tell LXC has some advantages like being available on the Linux kernel (so you don't need a special kernel to use it). From the other side, OpenVZ supports live migration.\nYou will have to check the capabilities of each tool and see which ones are most important to you.\nEdit:\nYou can find here a short review of the capabilities of each own.\nUpdate for OpenVZ 4:\nAs of OpenVZ 4, you can run OpenVZ on a stock Linux 3.0 kernel. OpenVZ still benefits from it's own kernel; there are some OpenVZ kernel specific features.\n\nA: I find it curious that there is all this sudden interest in LXC when the much more mature OpenVZ platform has been doing this very successfully for many years.  LXC is actually a derivative of OpenVZ for the mainline kernel so it's not some new idea. Booting from different kernels has always been trival so I don't see why that would be an issue with using OpenVZ.  I guess some people are not comfortable using a non-mainline kernel and maybe think newer things are sexier.\nLXC will probably eventually replace OpenVZ....in 10 years.  It's no where near ready yet.  Not even for bleeding edge development unless you don't mind missing features, spotty documentation, lack of 'internet experience' (ie.  built up knowledge base that is found by doing internet searches).  \nIn another year or two when it is more feature complete and there is more of a knowledgebase it will probably be ready for some offline non-critical things.  However, doing an internet search, people were saying that about it a year ago and it's still not there yet imho.\n\nA: This is a 1 year old question, but in view of changes in the playing field I would add my 2 cents.\nI would recommend that for containerization people should look at Docker. It is built on top of LXC (and other tools) and provides extensive tooling for container building, maintenance, distribution, and upgrade. As well, there is a fairly large community around it.\nOne notable difference is that Docker promotes \"single-process containers\" as opposed to the traditional use of LXC which is more of a light-weight fully fledged virtual machine. This requires some adjustment in thinking, but it has its benefits.\n\nA: Personally I find LXC is in rapid development and documentation lags.\nI personally use openvz on \"production servers\" and do not think LXC is yet mature enough to use in \"production\".\nI suggest you look at proxmox \nhttp://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page\nOffers a Debian host, web interface, and KVM and openvz.

Looking at the manual/website for Grub2 gives the information on how to boot an OS but when running .iso after booting Ubuntu EFI mode from DVD then dropping to command and entering search -f /vmlinuz or search -f /sbin/init no usable kernels are listed due to errors.  (No error codes given just confirms bad EFI files.)  \nThe output of ls -l at grub prompt\n\n\nA: This is a bit of a long shot, but Gigabyte motherboards with the hybrid EFI have a problem with case sensitivity: Certain comparisons are done in a case-sensitive way when in fact they should be done in a case-insensitive way. My suspicion is that you're running into this problem. You might try to mount the USB flash drive version of the installer with various options for the shortname mount option, move (don't copy) the kernel file (casper/vmlinuz.efi on the disk) off the disk, and then copy it back. This may adjust the case of the filename and make the file visible to GRUB. This type of change is possible, but much harder to do, using CD-R media.\nAnother option is to upgrade the firmware. Gigabyte lists several updates for this board, and it's possible that one of them will fix the problem. The latest is marked as a \"Beta BIOS,\" and it's possible it's not the buggy Hybrid EFI with which the computer shipped. (Gigabyte offers updates away from the Hybrid EFI on some boards, but I'm not sure if yours is one of them.)\nIf these suggestions both fail, my only other suggestion is to abandon use of EFI on this computer. If it has a Hybrid EFI, that is a VERY buggy EFI implementation, and it's almost never worth using. If you must, it's likely to be easier to install Linux in BIOS mode and then fix the EFI-mode booting once the basic installation is complete.\n", "Q: How can I tell when Files is done searching?

Use live cd and the grub-install? I have dual boot system(Windows XP and Ubuntu 12.04) that was running fine until an auto-update of grub2 this past week-end. \nI had been using the Windows boot loader to choose the O/S, which allowed me to retain the original Microsoft MBR on the hard drive. The setup had grub2 in a /boot partition (/dev/sda3) visible to the system BIOS in the first 137mb. Grub2 had been installed to the PBR in that partition. I had modified the Windows boot.ini file to point to a binary file copied from the /boot pbr, per a procedure whose URL escapes me at the moment, but is well known to dual-booters I believe.\nI can run the latest Ubuntu 12.04 live CD and get access to all partitions on the hard drive. I can run fdisl -l and blkid and see all of the particulars of the various partitions. What I am uncertain of is the exact incantation to use to cause grub-install to do only what I want to do to fix up my boot partition, assuming grub-install is indeed the way to go. \nIncidentally, I did look at the boot-repair tool and did not see it offering me the option of installing grub to other than the hard drive mbr. My boot partition is /dev/sda3 and the only option boot-repair appeared to permit for grub re-installation was to /dev/sda, rather than /dev/sda3. I take that to mean boot-repair will only install to the MBR, and not the PBR of /dev/sda3, though the menu labels are bit cryptic and I am guessing at meanings here.\nI'm thinking the grub-install script is the way to go, but my first attempt produced an error message that suggested it could not find a /boot directory. I suspect the live CD session and its separate file system may be causing confusion about that. I assume there is a specific syntax I should be using to get around that, but am just about at the limit of my know-how. \nI hesitate to tinker with syntax or script options and risk irreparably damaging my installation. I would be most appreciative if an expert coder would suggest a grub-install command line that will re-install grub2 on /dev/sda3 when executed from a terminal command line in an Ubuntu 12.04 live CD session.

Either your video card is malfunctioning or your monitor. Try a different OS or run an older version of Ubuntu via a USB drive. If the problem reappears then you most certainly have faulty hardware. Time to replace that video card likely.\n\nA: I've had this happen to me on a couple of occasions, on the first it turned out the be a dying graphics card but you've just ruled that out. On the second it was caused because I had previously installed the AMD proprietary graphics drivers from the AMD website and when the kernel was updated it broke the drivers. If this is the case try using the proprietary AMD drivers or Nvidia drivers as the case may be, that come with Ubuntu 13.04, I use the AMD proprietary drivers-update without issue.\n\nA: You are using the open source Gallium driver with the AMD HD 6670 graphics card, but it would be better to use the proprietary fglrx driver.\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\nReboot the system and check whether the AMD binary driver is in use with the fglrxinfo, glxinfo and lsmod | grep fglrx commands.\nYou can refer to this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI\n\nA: I had numerous issues with using a side by side dual monitor display until I tried disabling the video hardware acceleration. I had video corruption where both screens would become unreadable, system lock ups that required a power cord reset and numerous other issues like changing colors. Since creating and modifying the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file I have not seen a problem (about 10 days).\nNote I tried using proprietary drivers and multiple other fixes without success.\nOn Ubuntu 13.1 you have to create the file. You cannot use a file from another machine.\nI tried the following from another post but it didn't work (possibly because my machine was pretty messed up by fixes). It may work for others.\nswitch to console mode: Alt+Ctrl+F1\nkill x server: sudo service lightdm stop\ngenerate new xorg.conf file: sudo X -configure -- this will create xorg.conf.new file in your current dir\nrename and move: sudo mv xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nreturn to GUI: sudo start lightdm\n\nWhat I eventually did was boot to the command prompt skipping the display manager entirely. Either way you have to stop the X Window system to create the file.\nThe new file is named something like xorg.conf.new.\nOnce the file was created I renamed it to xorg.conf , edited the NoAccel line,  made sure it had root ownership and put it in /etc/X11/.\nOpen the xorg.conf file with sudo nautilus or gksudo gedit or some other root editor.\nThen scroll down till you find the line that says.\n#Option \"NoAccel\"  #[,bool>]  \n\nand change it to\nOption \"NoAccel\"         \"True\"\n\nI don't use a desktop with lots of animations and special effects. Just two screens\nwith one as and extension of the first so I can keep several windows open at once.\nThis works real well for me and like I said , it's not crashing or acting up any more.\n", "Q: Lubuntu minimize all show desktop keyboard shortcut?

I'm trying to install ubuntu on a Lenovo Y500. I have disabled UEFI and Secure Boot, and reinstalled Windows. I booted from a USB key with Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit, and installed it with the bootloader installed on the '/' root partition. When I add Ubuntu to the Windows boot manager using EasyBCD with GRUB2 I get an error about not finding Ubuntu, and when I use syslinux I get a black screen.\nI want to use Windows to manage the boot process, so please no solutions using ubuntu as the initial bootloader.\n\nA: One thing I found is that sometimes when you install from USB, the installer assigns sda to the USB instead of your hard drive.  Subsequently your partition table is all messed up. You may want to check that.  Generally I try to install from the CD to avoid this issue.\nWhen I did install 13.04 (to dual boot with Win8) I had to go into the BIOS settings to change which drive boots first.  Note I am trying to get GRUB to manage the boot, not Windows so we're different here.  \nWhat I have right now is that if I boot normally I get the GRUB menu which loads Ubuntu fine, but if I select Windows 8 from GRUB it fails to load Windows.  If I boot the laptop using the menu button on the side I can select the Windows partition (using the Lenovo's boot order option) and Windows 8 will load fine (bypassing GRUB).  So not an ideal situation but it at least works somewhat.\nSo I can't answer your question directly but hopefully my somewhat similar experiences will help you.\nI'd be interested to know how you set Windows to manage the boot process, though.\n", "Q: Youtube videos are slow?

Try going here and clicking the link to participate in the YouTube HTML5 beta. The player isn't as nice, but it should perform better.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, as you said it has persisted across multiple browsers, and speed checks out. I am assuming Ubuntu is your OS.\n1.Try deleting your 'libflashplayer.so' plugins and re-download from adobe. Unpack and move back to plugin directory of your browser.\n2.Try clearing (in chromium) your history. Also go to tools in control menu, and clear browsing data. Might be a weird caching problem.\nDid you add any extensions? Do other video sites, or flash games work? As a last resort un-install chromium, and remove completely in Synaptic, and all old config files, and reinstall. \nMight need a system update, if you haven't tried already.

My output is:\n\nlo        no wireless extensions.\neth2      IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:\"AIRTEL\"\n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point: 50:67:F0:C7:CF:7C\n          Bit Rate=54 Mb/s   Tx-Power=200 dBm\n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Encryption key:off\n          Power Management:on\n          Link Quality=50/70  Signal level=-60 dBm\n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\nAs you see above mine is \"eth2\"\n2-) Now in \"TERMINAL\" type \"sudo iwconfig >>your wireless device name<< power off\" As I typed \"sudo iwconfig eth2 power off\" That's it.

This is most likely the case if the network is in a university, at work, or maybe even a (smart) coffee shop.\nWhen you ping 8.8.8.8, an IP should be mentioned in that message you got. I'm betting that that IP is 192.168.1.1, so the error would be something like reply: 192.168.1.1 destination host unreachable. Also, to be more certain, you can do a traceroute. This shows you the path that your ping travels, so we can find exactly where it stops. So, if you run the command traceroute -n 8.8.8.8, you'll probably get something like this:\nI think you might need to install traceroute using sudo apt-get install traceroute.\nalaa@aa-UBUNTU:~$ traceroute -n 8.8.8.8\ntraceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n 1  192.168.1.1  1.204 ms  1.953 ms  2.101 ms\n 2  * * *\n 3  * * *\n\n...and those stars will just keep on coming. This means that your ping went to 192.168.1.1, but then it stopped, it hit a wall, so you'll never be able to ping 8.8.8.8.\nAlso, this has nothing to do with DNS, because you're pinging an IP, not a hostname like google.com. DNS is a system that merely translates the words google.com to something like 74.125.236.105. If there was something wrong with your DNS settings, ping google.com would return something like this: ping: unknown host google.com, but ping 8.8.8.8 would not, because you're already pinging a direct IP.\nI suggest you revert the changes you made to NetworkManager.conf.\n", "Q: My Ubuntu Live CD will only connect to my wired internet on one computer I recently burned the Ubuntu 12.4.2 live cd, and put it in my Lenovo N580 notebook to install Ubuntu to my 32 GB Sandisk flash drive. It completed successfully, but after booting from my flash drive my computer would not connect to the internet via ethernet, or even recognize a physical conection. The computer's main operating system is Windows 8, and it will connect to my ethernet just fine. An idea occured to me, so I tried it. I put my Live CD into my Sony Vaio VPCEE41FX and booted from the live cd successfully, but on that computer it WOULD connect to my ethernet. I cleared Ubuntu off of my flash drive and thought about installing it on the Vaio since it could connect to the internet with my ethernet. If I did this, would that make the copy of the OS on my flash drive be able to connect to my home internet through ethernet on my Lenovo notebook? This is really frustrating, and is causing me a lot of greif. If anyone has had a similar isue and solved it, or if anyone knows how to help me, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nA: There is no driver loaded for your wired ethernet adapter, however you can load it by executing:\nmodprobe alx\nIf it's working, tell the system to load this driver on every boot:\necho alx >> /etc/modules\nThe wireless adapter seems to have the appropriate driver loaded.\n\nA: If you can plug the Lenovo in to a wired network, you can download and install the package providing the driver for your network card with\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.4-$(uname -r)\n\nIf you can't connect the Lenovo to a wired network, you can download the package from http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/admin/.  You need to choose the package that matches your kernel version.  Run uname -r in a terminal and find the package that ends in the same version number.\n", "Q: What is telepathy in ubuntu?What is the relation of telepathy and empathy? I have tried to clean up unused packages/software and I tried to remove telepathy but it also affects the empathy package which I use. That makes me wonder why empathy depends on telepathy and what does telepathy do. Could anyone or someone explain me this.\n\nA: Telepathy is a framework for instant messaging. When you set up a chat account in the Online Accounts settings panel, you're setting up a login associated with Telepathy.\nEmpathy is a frontend for Telepathy. That is, Empathy provides a user interface for interacting with the Telepathy system.\nIf you wanted to, you could replace Empathy with another frontend to Telepathy and all your accounts would be there, because it's the same underlying framework. Empathy also does not do everything that Telepathy does - for example, IIRC, Telepathy provides a system to make phone calls, an ability that Empathy does not expose.\n", "Q: System periodically stalls for less then 1s then resumes normally Periodically my system stalls for a short while (less then 1s).

There appear to be a number of \"Howto\" type documents about building a custom kernel on Ubuntu. Here's a straightforward one featuring make menuconfig. Granted, it doesn't mention the linux-tools package and related packages, but it does get to the point of how to build a kernel from source. \nHere's a more expansive tutorial, featuring a direct pull from the Kernel's Git repository. GIYF. HTH. Cheers.\n\nA: Can you check if the stalls are linked to disk activity ? \nUbuntu Desktop ships with mlocate enabled, which \"scan\" the drive once per day and generate quite an amount of reads.\nOn my desktop, it often leads to stalls like yours.

But sometimes, I miss the link by a few dots which leads in firefox going a page back.\nIn Windows that behavior does not occur. How can I change this, so nothing happens, when middleclicking anywhere except of links?\n\nA: Hm, it seems that you changed a setting.\nAccording to the default setup a middleclick in some area should not go backwards in history.\nSometimes I accidentally paste an url with a middle click somewhere in a page... Could that explain the behaviour you see?\n\nA: I'm using the UX nightly(i think i recall encountering it with ubuntu's own firefox too) and this behaviour appears to be default, though i'm not sure quite why, googling i found a post blaming it on middlemouse.contentLoadURL being set true by default on linux, which i personally think is a bit stupid to begin with, but the puzzling thing is that, while it's suggested to be interactions between clipboard.autocopy and middlemouse.contentLoadURL, it occurs with urls which were never selected or manually copied, which seems to go against the latter's stated function. Even more odd is that, having toggled middlemouse.contentloadurl to false and back again the behaviour has disappeared, which makes this situation look very buggy indeed. \nThis was mainly a problem for me as my over-excitable trackpad sends middle click events at random from time to time and mozilla's the only browser than navigates away from the current page when these occur. This behaviour is neither predictable nor expected for 95% of typical ubuntu users, or 99.9% of ubuntu's target market.\nhttp://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/887873\n", "Q: How to capture Code::Blocks screenshot I'm trying to make some notes of Code::Blocks with wxWidgets.

Most hard drives are reported as failures after multiple repartitions and MBR becomes corrupt without actual hardware part failure.

How do I do that ?\n\nA: You can chown the respective folders to a group of which the webserver is a member, but both users are not. Lets assume, the server is running as user www-server, the users are called user1 and user2. Then, if there isn't a suitable group yet (usually there is), create a new one and add the webserver user to it:\nsudo addgroup www-private\nsudo adduser www-server www-private\n\nNow, for each user the private folder should be chowned so that the owning user is the respective user, and the owning group is the one of the webserver:\nsudo chown user1:www-private /path/to/folder/of/user1\nsudo chown user2:www-private /path/to/folder/of/user2\n\nThe permissions can now be set accordingly, so that the user has write access to his own folder, the webserver has read access and any other user has no access:\nsudo chmod 750 /path/to/folder/of/user1 /path/to/folder/of/user2\n\nIf I remember correctly, this should give you the desired result.\n", "Q: Full switch locale: Ubuntu server installed with no locales, how to enable locales systemwide?

SO call that computer/server/terminal 'Waterboy' It may help.\nAm I nerding out?!?!\n\nA: you could install and run ClamAV (softwarecenter) and check for malicious software on your computer. \nShould you have Wine installed: purge it via Synaptic (complete removal) , and do a reinstall if nessecary. \nFor the record: there is very few malicious software for Linux (don't mix it with a past with Windows !!), so the chance that your system is compromised is almost zip. \nA good advice is: chose a strong password for your root (you can easily change that if nessecary). \nDon't get to paranoïd about Ubuntu and malicious software; stay within the lines of the softwarecenter/ don't install random PPA's / don't install .deb-packages that have no guarantees nor certified backgrounds ; doing so your system will remain clean without a hastle. \nIt is also advisable to remove each time you close your Firefox-browser (or Chromium) for having all cookies deleted and clean up your history; this is easily set in preferences. \n\nA: Back when I ran public servers, I would install them in a non-networked environment and then install Tripwire on them (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/).  \nTripwire basically checked all the files on the system and generated reports. You could exclude the ones that you say are allowed to change (like log files) or that you don't care about (mail files, browser cache locations, etc).\nIt was a lot of work going through the reports and setting it up, but it was nice to know that if a file changed, and you didn't install an update to change it, you knew there was something that needed to be investigated. I never actually needed all this, but I'm glad we ran it along with firewall software and regular port scans of the network.  \nFor the last 10 years or so I've only had to maintain my personal machine, and with no one else having physical access or accounts on the box, and no public services (or much reason to target my machine specifically) I'm a little more lax so I haven't used Tripwire in years...but it may be something you're looking for to generate reports of file changes.\n\nA: Best thing to do in your scenario is format weekly or shorter.\nInstall a program like spideroak to sync your data securely. That way after reformat all you have to do is download spideroak and all your data comes back.\nIt used to be easier with ubuntuone but that's gone now :(\nbtw: spideroak only guarantees zero knowledge if you never access your files on their site via a web session. you must use only their software client to access data and to change your password.\n", "Q: Formatting External Hard Drives Is there any way I can re-format my external hard drive to accept larger data files without erasing the current stored data on the drive??\n\nA: A reformat, by nature, destroys all data on a disk. There's no way of avoiding this.\nIf you need to change the filesystem on it (e.g. from FAT to NTFS or some other change - I assume something along these lines is the nature of your question?), then by far your best bet would be to back up everything onto another device and then copy back after the reformat.\n\nA: No, if you format a Hard-drive you should backup your Data. \nread this: Is possible to format hard drive without losing files?\n\nA: If you want to move from ext3 to 4 that is possible without having to format the disc:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-convert-ext3-to-ext4-file-system.html\nBut even then you should always back up your data somewhere else in case the process goes wrong and your data is lost.\n", "Q: Using multiple internet connections on ubuntu My network topology is as follows:\nPC (1 nic) ======> Switch =======> 2 routers (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.11).\nThe PC has only 1 nic (ethernet port).\nBoth routers connected to their respective isps.\nNeed a quick and simple way to make Ubuntu use both the broadband connections.\nPlease dont point me to Bonding (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBonding)\nThat is a different thing, bonding combines 2 nics into 1.\nI need to use 2 routers at the same time (like having 2 gateways at the same time)\n\nA: You need a switch, that is capable of doing the bonding.

If you notice anything more specific missing (ie: wireless, or some buttons) create a new question about that, reboot the laptop, remove the CD and no changes will actually happen to it.\nFrom all I see your system should not have any issues running Ubuntu, test it.\n\nA: Perhaps you do. It isn't clear whether the L series ThinkPads are eligible for the tp_smapi driver. Try asking in the ThinkPad SL and L Series forum or the Linux Questions forum at ThinkPads.com. Since the closely related SL series isn't covered by the driver, I suspect the L series isn't either.\nIf you discover your laptop will benefit from tp_smapi, install the package as noted at ThinkWiki.org. Open a Terminal (keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T) and execute these commands:\nsudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms\nsudo modprobe tp_smapi\n\nAny time you perform a distribution upgrade, say from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 later this year, re-add the module:\nsudo modprobe tp_smapi\n\n", "Q: Amount of data written on a partition Is there any way to find out how much data have been written on the partition since it was created?\nTalking about ext4 fs.\n\nA: Take a look at the files in /sys/fs/ext4/<dev-name>/.\nYou would be interested in /sys/fs/ext4/<dev-name>/lifetime_write_kbytes.\n\nlifetime_write_kbytes \nThis file is read-only and shows the number\n  of kilobytes of data that have been written to this filesystem since\n  it was created.\n\nhth\nEXT4 Kernel docs\n\nA: If you mean how much space is used/free on each partition, simply open a terminal (ctrl-alt-T) and type df. Alternatively you can use df -h to shorten gigabytes, megabytes etc. This will show you the usage (in bytes and percentage) of all mounted partitions, regardless of the file system each is formatted to.\n\nA: If supported by the drive we can read the number of LBAs written during a drive's lifetime from it's S.M.A.R.T data with smartclt (from smartmontools ):\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sdX\n\nReplace sdX with the drive you want to read.\nThe entry 241 Total LBAs Written displays the total count of LBAs written during the device's lifetime.

Can I somehow define them in .profile, and have them pulled into .bashrc?  Or maybe add them to a 3rd file, and have that file referenced in .bashrc and .profile?\n\nA: From man bash:\n\nWhen bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and  executes  commands  from  the file  /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.\n\nand\n\nBash attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input connected to a network connection, as when executed by the remote shell daemon, usually  rshd,  or  the  secure  shell  daemon  sshd.   If  bash  determines it is being run in this fashion, it reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist and are readable.  It will not do this if invoked as sh.  The --norc option may be used to inhibit this  behavior,  and  the --rcfile option may be used to force another file to be read, but rshd does not generally invoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.\n\nIn other words, ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc will normally both be read when you start bash, so you can put it in either.\nYou can also use the source luke in either file to load the file luke where you would define all your Javan variables. See help . or help source for details.\n\nA: You can do exactly what you mentioned.   When you remote ssh into bash terminal the .bash_profile will be sourced and when you create a new xterm the .bashrc will be sourced.  Would be better if you put your environment variable information into another file .profile and from both of the .bash_profile and .bashrc source the .profile\n. ~/.profile\nBeware that sourcing .profile from .bashrc may create an infinite loop since the default .profile in Ubuntu sources .bashrc. See this reply about the dangers of sourcing.\n\nA: First, You will never add JAVA_HOME to your PATH. They serve different purposes as environment variables. The first, sets where your java binaries are installed so other java based programs can know. The second, is a set of places where bash will look for commands you type in terminal, like ls, cd etc.\nSecond, both the files will work, but you have to be careful when setting variables inside .bashrc, because you may overwrite the ones already configured in other files, as PATH. The most safe way of doing this is by adding \":$PATH\" at the end of the path. It would be something like this (adds java binaries to your PATH to be able to call commands such as javac): \nexport PATH=\"/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_121/bin:$PATH\"\n\nTo set JAVA_PATH, the most safe (and automatic... rsrs) way to do so is by adding the following code in the end of .bashrc:\nexport JAVA_HOME=$(update-alternatives --query javac | sed -n -e 's/Best: *\\(.*\\)\\/bin\\/javac/\\1/p')\n\nAfter you have done so, you will have do execute exec bash, or close and reopen the terminal window. To check if your variables are set, run on the terminal:\necho $JAVA_HOME\necho $PATH\n\nYou should be able to see the value inside the variables.\nUPDATE:\nRemember that all these files like .bashrc are located in your home directory. Something like /home/<your name> or just by typing cd without any other arguments. Remember too, that files that start with a 'dot' . are not visible just by typing ls on terminal. if you want to see these files you have to ls -a\n", "Q: OS-Prober doesn't show my Windows 7 partition I'm having a problem installing Ubuntu 12.04 on my ASUS UX31A alongside Windows 7; I tried to launch os-prober in my terminal and the only option I get is: \n/dev/sda5:Windows Recovery Environment (loader):Windows1:chain\n\nwhile Windows 7 (mounted on dev/sda3) is not shown.\nThis is what I see in my Disk Manager in Windows 7:\n\nC: basically is the partition with Windows system's file, while the D: one is for data), while this is what I see when I launch GParted: \n\nMay it be because Windows is installed on SSD?

It's very clearly explained in the wiki:\n\nxauth is a mechanism for enforcing access controls on X servers\n  (displays). When an X server is started, it is given a\n  randomly-generated \"cookie\". This cookie is written to a file owned\n  and readable by the user whose session the X server is running. No\n  other users can read that file.

It also sounds like you are giving putty the IP 127.0.0.1. If that is the case, you are telling putty to connect to your windows computer. To find the IP on ubuntu, you could run ip addr show (on the ubuntu computer), then use the IP address for the interface you are using for internet (en0, wlan0, etc) with putty. \n\nA: I just had to install SSH on the server:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\nHope this helps a fellow newbe running Win 8 with Ubuntu 13.04 as a guest OS in VMWare Player\n", "Q: Hard drive location keeps changing after upgrade to 13.04 After I upgraded to 13.04 the hard drive media location keeps changing.  These are installed hard drives not removable media.  This issue does not seem to affect usability via the file managers (Nautilus and Dolphin) but it does affect symlinks.\nIn the following 'disk' represents the disk name and 'home' is my home directory name.\nOn one boot the media location is '/media/disk/' on another it's 'media/home/disk/'.  There's no pattern that I've found so far as to when its one way or the other.  The symlinks are written differently pending the mounting location.  Some point to one location and other point to the other location.  Their usability changes on rebooting where the ones that worked break and vise versa.\nFor example after I boot if I mount another drive it sometimes mounts at 'media/home/disk/'.  If I mount another it  mounts at 'media/disk/'.  If I unmount the first that was at 'media/home/disk/' and remount that very same drive, it mounts at 'media/disk/'.\nI was under the impression that internal hard drives ate supposed to be mounted at 'media/disk/' and removable media and disks at 'media/home/disk/'.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nSo ultimately it seems that the underlying problem is where the drives are getting mounted.  Then the question is where are they supposed to be mounted and why dosen't the system consistently mount them there?\nI had a similar issue on upgrading to 12.10 but that seemed to be a bug and was resolved quickly.\nIs this a bug or is it something I can fix permanently?\nThanks.\n\nA: Since they're internal drives, it makes most sense to mount them statically. You can add lines to your /etc/fstab file in order to define your own mount point. See for example mine (I have two partitions apart from /, which I have mounted to /data/ and /media/Windows, for instance)\n\nFirst, run sudo blkid, this will tell you the UUID for all drives attached to your system. Then add the following lines before the line #swap was on /dev/sdb5 during installation:\n#Entry for /dev/sdc1\nUUID=[UUID]    [mountpoint]    [type]    defaults    0    [pass]\n\nwhere [UUID] is the number you found from blkid, [mountpoint] is a directory (you can create this wherever you want, possibly requiring sudo mkdir if in the root of the system); [type] is the filesystem in use (usually ext4 or ntfs), and [pass], from what I can gather, is best put as 2 for a secondary ext4 drive or 0 for an ntfs one (it has to do with how the filesystem checker, fsck, behaves with it - this could be false advice for ntfs, but for me at least it's trundled along quite nicely)\nSee here for further guidance: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MoveMountpointHowto\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to downgrade from LibreOffice 4.0 to 3.6? How to \"properly\" downgrade LibreOffice versions deals with a downgrade from 3.5 to 3.4.*. Is there any way to nicely downgrade LibreOffice 4.0 to 3.6? The latter is not in the package lists.\nBackground: It is because of this bug which is about the incompatibility of an extension which should really be core functionality. Essentially, 4.0 just does not deal with templates in an intelligent way. You cannot fully apply a template to an existing document. \nUpdate: based on apt-cache showpkg libreoffice (found on How to Downgrade a Package via apt-get?) one can confirm that only LibreOffice 4.* is in the repositories.\n\nA: For me this worked:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\nsudo apt-get purge libreoffice*\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThen remove ppa for LibreOffice4\nAdd ppa for LibreOffice3.6\nsudo apt-get update\n\nvia synaptic reinstall packages which make problems for me it was libexttextcat \nInstall LibreOffice via synaptic.\n\nA: There is a way to downgrade but not as \"nicely\" as I would like.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Synaptic sudo apt-get install synaptic\n\n*Uninstall libreoffice sudo apt-get purge libreoffice\n\n*Add the Libreoffice 3.6 ppa sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-3-6\n\n*Refresh the repositories list sudo apt-get update\n\n*Install LO 3.6 sudo apt-get install libreoffice=1:3.6.6-0ubuntu1~precise1~ppa1 .

I was able to transfer music by installing few libraries and then my device was recognised by rhythmbox. But no success in transferring pdf files to ipad. Any suggestions??\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can copy pdf files to the iPad to be used with the iBooks app. However, just copying pdf files to the iPad will not do; the trick is to imitate Apple's \".plist\" configuration files.\nIf you are comfortable using python, here is a simple script that will do the job for you. Simply place your pdf files in the Books/Managed folder and then run the following in that directory. Once this script is run, the iPad will recognize your pdf files. These pdf files can even by in subdirectories.\n    header = \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \\\"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\\\" \\\"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\\\">\\n<plist version=\\\"1.0\\\">\\n<dict>\\n <key>Books</key>\\n  <array>\\n\"\n\n    footer = \"  </array>\\n</dict>\\n</plist>\"\n    fst = \"     <dict>\\n            <key>Inserted-By-iBooks</key>\\n         <false/>\\n             <key>Name</key>\\n            <string>\"\n    tnd = \"</string>\\n          <key>Page Progression Direction</key>\\n         <string>default</string>\\n          <key>Path</key>\\n           <string>\"\n    lst = \"</string>\\n          <key>s</key>\\n          <string>0</string>\\n        </dict>\\n\"\n    bodystr = \"\"\n\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(\".\", topdown=False):\n        for name in files:\n        sttmp = os.path.join(root, name)[2:]\n            if not \".pdf\" in sttmp:\n        continue\n    bodystr+=fst\n    bodystr+=sttmp[:-4]\n    bodystr+=tnd\n    bodystr+=sttmp\n    bodystr+=lst\n\nfile = open(\"Managed.plist\", \"w\")\nfile.write(header);\nfile.write(bodystr);\nfile.write(footer);\nfile.close();\n\n\nA: If your machine and your iPad are connected within a wifi network, you can make simple HTTP server serving PDF files that can be downloaded from iPad.\nMake sure you have python installed, open up a terminal and cd to the directory where you store your PDF files. Then run this command:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\n\nAnd on your iPad open up the web browser and go to URL: http://<ip.of.machine>:8000\nVoila! You can see your PDF files and download them into your iPad.\n\nA: Transferring any kind of file to any Apple device (ipad included) is only officially supported through cloud-syncing, such as iTunes file-sharing or services like Dropbox. The simplest way would be to use Dropbox, which works well if you want to access your pdf files from multiple devices.\n\nA: The best option I came up with is to install adobe reader on my Ipad. All you gotta do is connect the Ipad to your pc and the Ipad gets mounted. Then open \"Documents on (your Ipad name)\" , locate adobe reader there , open adobe reader and then you see the Documents folder. Just place your pdf file in that folder. That's it! you are good to go :). \n\nA: I recommend Dropbox.

Go figure.)\nAnyway, the Wi-Fi adapter I tried to use malfunctioned very quickly, and, after a bit of troubleshooting, I gave up (for the time being.) I decided to try and get the built-in ethernet working. The Lubuntu box is wired via Ethernet to a computer running Windows XP, which is connected to Wi-Fi and is set to share it. Trouble is, Windows says the ethernet cable is unplugged, and the computer running Lubuntu is entirely oblivious to the existence of its Ethernet port. lspci | grep -i eth returns absolutely nothing, so I can't even put the correct firmware on a USB stick and install it that way.\nWhat's wrong? I will provide any computer/OS/BIOS/etc details requested.\nUPDATE: Found out why Lubuntu wasn't recognizing the Ethernet - the BIOS had Onboard LAN disabled. I enabled it, but now the tray icon says \"Ethernet - device not managed\", and sudo ifup eth0 starts spamming a bunch of stuff about DHCP, and the command never finishes.\n\nA: Look into /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and change the line managed=false to managed=true then restart network-manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n", "Q: How to reset KDE / display settings after a move to a new machine I've recently upgraded my hardware to a new laptop, and installed the latest kubuntu build on the new machine.  Various advice here and elsewhere led me to hope that I could bring all of my KDE settings over to the new machine by copying my home directory and .kde dir over to the new machine.  I've done that, but it comes up with a mostly blank garbled screen with blue gibberish along the bottom instead of the menu bar - basically unusable in the graphical interface.  Presumably this is because the old graphics settings aren't compatable with the new hardware (the monitors are the same, but the new machine has a new graphics card.)\nI can log in to a command-line tty at Ctrl-Alt-F1.  I'm looking for how to reset the display settings without losing (or with losing as little as possible of) my other settings; I imagine wiping my entire .kde directory would get me back, but I'm hoping for something less drastic.

I'm looking to create a UPnP server on my 13.04 server installation. I've done some searching and installing but nothing seems to fit the criteria for me.\nI'm just wondering if there are any still maintained UPnP servers for 13.04?\nI've been playing with Mediatomb, but it doesn't organize my files correctly, even after linking to import scripts. Furthermore, it doesn't appear to be maintained anymore, as the most recent release is still from quite a while ago, though I may be wrong.\nPS3 Media Server doesn't seem to work with a variety of devices either.\n\nA: There are a variety of problems with each different dlna/upnp media server option. It's simply a matter of choosing which compromise works best for you. On a workstation type system, where you're running Unity or GNOME, and logged in all the time, and want to run a media server as the user you're logged in as, I would highly recommend rygel, as it works quite well, supports a wide variety of formats, uses standard infrastructure such as GStreamer and tracker, and can transcode on the fly. I have been using it for several years now.\nHowever, it does require a DBus session bus, and X11 display, which presents a bit of a problem when running on a headless server system. I recently migrated all my Music and Video files over to my local server, which has a huge RAID setup, and runs Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS, and is of course, headless. Unfortunately, rygel wasn't usable there, so I had to find something else. I am running minidlna as the media server there, and it is working quite well. It is maintained (there's a newer version in 13.04), but not without its own set of flaws. I would recommend it for a headless server, though. It's very simple to set up, and even runs as a system service, just like apache or dnsmasq. Just remember to make sure all the files and directories you're pointing it at, are readable by the minidlna user, or everyone, before you start it. It doesn't take too long for it to scan the files, and it's very easy to blow away the database cache it creates, and restart the service, to force a rescan.\n\nA: As I ran into trouble with miniDLNA (e.g. my Samsung TV failed to play videos), I decided to try out Serviio. It worked out-of-the-box, and my UE55ES plays videos fine even using the Generic profile (Serviio offers different profiles for problematic clients). Video files needed some naming tricks for metadata to be collected, but that was all to do (except for downloading static FFMPeg binaries optionally).

Is this package the documentation of the library ? Is it possible to read it and if yes how ? If no ,the only \"documentation\" for libraries like utouch is the header files ? \n\nA: Generally, if there is a -doc package for a library, then yes, it is the documentation. Generally, it is also in HTML format. There's also a package devhelp for reading development oriented documentation. If the documentation does not appear in the devhelp application, then you can simply read the documentation in a browser, by opening the HTML files in a browser. Some of these packages also include man pages, rather than HTML documentation.

So I will be left with a system that is showing me in foreground the nautilus app but the keyboard and mouse focus are on a minimized, background app (Wine Game for example).\nSo how can I either get the ALT+TAB back or be able to get focus on the current active window and be able to switch back and forth again. This can also happen to only one input, for example, the wine game might have the keyboard focused on it, but the mouse is not (Sometimes even lost and not usable until Wine is closed). \n\nA: Switching desktops did the trick for me.\nI use Openbox, and have hit this snag in FlStudio 10, it seems to me that the wineserver will allow you to alt-tab out, and back in, however sometime after doing it once it stops the alt-tab window from showing. Like I said I use Openbox, so my experience might be different, all I have to do is hold the alt button press tab once then proceed to switch desktops (mouse-wheel). since I don't use unity, I'm not certain that that is the default binding there, but it does seem to be a common binding. Do be careful some games/programs don't like this, for instance Command and Conquer 3 will almost certainly crash, be sure to save first!!!\n\nA: I was able to solve this for my setup --- I'm using Wine play Hearthstone through Lutris. The trick is to edit the registry using regedit in Wine for this particular game, following this user's suggestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Regedit\n\n*Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wine\\X11 Driver, creating it if it does not exist\n\n*Create a new entry named \"UseTakeFocus\" with value \"N\"\n\n\nThis not only fixed my alt-tabbing issues, I was able to modify the window size and change between fullscreen and windowed mode in-game with only the expected behavior!\nSpecifically in Lutris, I selected the game (Hearthstone), clicked \"Wine registry\", and added the value in Regedit as suggested (when creating the new entry, it's right click, add key, String value; then right click modify it to make the value \"N\"). Then close out; the registry should be saved (but you can edit it again to double check that the new value is there). Then launch the game and the new behavior is in place.\nI expect this doesn't work across games, because it depends the game having proper support for Desktop keyboard shortcuts and window management modifications.\n\nA: My solution is simple. before running the game turn on emulate virtual desktop in wine configuration>graphics\n", "Q: Connect to a network using only keyboard My mouse does not work right now, but still I would like to connect to the Internet.

I tried to submit an app to the Ubuntu Software Centre but it was rejected because you needed to put in the admin password to use it. I need to grant root privileges to the app for it to function so I used sudo. But they said I can't use sudo in my app. How can I give it root privileges?\n\nA: You need to use the PolicyKit APIs to request the escalation of privileges. In general, you should only do so when it's absolutely necessary, and not run the application with escalated privileges at all times.\nIt's worth noting that if you only need root privileges on startup, you can and should start up as root, but then drop to an unprivileged user. If you're operating as a user-facing program, this probably means the user that ran the program; if this means a daemon, like an httpd or sshd, it probably means an incredibly locked-down user that's created specifically for your program to run under.\nAlso, there are graphical frontends to sudo called gksudo and kdsudo for GNOME and KDE, respectively. If someone recommends that you use these, don't. Be aware that these programs are deprecated in favor of PolicyKit, are not installed by default, and will probably get your app rejected.\n\nA: Your app might not be permitted at all. According to the Ubuntu wiki, the App Review Board will reject applications that touch system files:\n\nYour application appears to touch system files as part of its operation, however we do not allow apps to do this as part of a security policy for extras.ubuntu.com. For these applications, we recommend that you follow the steps on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages for submitting your package to Debian or Ubuntu.\n\nA cleanup app would be touching system files.\nWhile this guideline only applies to open-source apps (the policy for proprietary apps is not published), I imagine similar rules apply to proprietary apps.\nIf your app is open-source, you can still get it into the Software Center by packaging it and submitting it to the main Ubuntu or Debian repositories.\n\nA: You don't need PolicyKit or any of that. Just change the apps owner and permission level:\nsudo chown root:root /path/to/app\nsudo chmod 4755 /path/to/app\n\nOf course, you will need root privileges in order to execute these commands.\n", "Q: What is the \"Dash\"?

If you're running a version of Ubuntu that still uses the Dash, it's time to upgrade.\n\nUbuntu's Unity Dash served as a user interface for Ubuntu to search for files and applications, listen to music, watch videos, view photos, and monitor online social accounts\n\nGuide to the Ubuntu Unity Dash\n", "Q: How can I change the mount point path while using udisks?

This is the behavior of the kernel and is for security reasons. It's the same reason why you can't do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda as a non-root user; it would wipe your hard drive. That said, there are ways that you can override the default behavior of the kernel (ah, the beauty of Linux) to get the functionality that you want.\nYou could do one of two things:\nI would recommend editing your sudoers file to not require a password so that you can sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 without requiring a password to be entered every time. By editing the sudoers file you ensure that you and only you are able to do this and all other users of the system are excluded.\nTo do this:\nsudo visudo\n\nThen add the following lines to the file:\nCmnd_Alias TCPDUMP_WLAN0 = /usr/bin/tcpdump -i wlan0\n[username] ALL= NOPASSWD: TCPDUMP_WLAN0 #Be sure to replace [username] with your username\n\nThis still requires you to type \"sudo\" every time, but you could set a bash alias for this as well so that all you do is type tcpdump and it executes sudo tcpdump -i wlan0. To do this you simply edit the ~/.bashrc file and add the line: alias tcpdump=\"/usr/bin/tcpdump -i wlan0\"\nUsing the sudoers file is the most security-conscious way of doing things. Now, if you're really adamant about not using sudo what-so-ever then I will give you want you want. However, the following command will grant all users the ability to run this program with the needed capabilities, so there's no fine user control.\nKeep in mind, that this is untested, however it should work. If it doesn't I have a third solution below.\nsudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep /usr/bin/tcpdump\n\nFinally, if that doesn't work you can setuid on the file itself. What this does is it runs the program as the owner of the file (in this case, root). Like the above, anybody who executes this file will become root to run it. You should really only use this as a last resort and only if you fully trust that the program is non-exploitable and can in no way be used as a lever to compromise your system.\nsudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/tcpdump\n\n", "Q: Skype can't connect with mobile broadband internet I now use a mobile broadband key to connect to the internet.

I run Ubuntu 12.04, and Skype was downloaded from the Software Centre. Skype still signs in when I have a wifi or wired internet connection.\nAny suggestions?? \nPS, I'm not very good with the terminal app!\n\nA: You should google around and see if your ISP is blocking Skype.\nIn Ireland where I am, a number of networks did this when they first started selling 3G handsets to try to protect their call revenue stream.\nIf you post your network provider and country, it might be possible to assist in finding more info.\nOne network provider I'm aware of blocked Viber, Whatsapp and Skype until enough business users complained then they were unblocked for bill pay customers but if you were on a pay as you go phone (top up as you use it) then they still blocked it until eventually they gave up on that too because their competitors started allowing these services and they had to enable it for competition reasons.\nBut here it sounds like everything is working fine with your connection and I would suggest, it is your mobile broadband provider that is causing the problem one way or another.

So, for some people this means that Unity cannot be loaded.\nNow, I understand that Unity has become a central part of Ubuntu (and I expect some backlash for my answer), however in your case I would recommend ditching it.

You may even be brave and try gnome-shell, but I'm guessing you'll get nowhere with that either.\nIn order to use it, you have to select it at the login screen.

Your guess is as good as mine as to why. So, to set up DNS correctly, try setting your DNS settings inside of the Network Manager GUI. You can get to this by clicking the networking icon in the upper right and going to Network Settings. From here, select your DSL connection (I'm assuming it's ethernet, but it could be WiFi) and then go to \"Options...\" and go to the IPv4 settings.\nJust a side thought, I don't believe you should have to configure PPPoE client side.

Writing a conf file and placing it in /etc/init is easy enough, but that doesn't seem to completely install. For one, the service --status-all doesn't list my new service. I checked and if I make a link in /etc/init.d to /lib/init/ubstart-job it'll show up in the status. But doing this manually makes me think I'm not doing it right, and there may well be other configuration steps which aren't being done.\nWhat is the correct way to install an upstart service such that it is properly registered in all tools dealing with services?\n\nA: When you initially copy a new conf file into the /etc/init folder you need to call:\ninitctl reload-configuration\n\nBy this your upstart should be properly registered.\n\nA: Checkout the service manual:\n\nservice --status-all runs all init scripts, in alphabetical order, with the status command. This option only calls status for sysvinit jobs, upstart jobs can be queried in a similar manner with initctl list.\n\n(emphasis added)\nThat's why adding it to /etc/init.d (where the sysvinit jobs are located) made that work. So: try running initctl list instead :) .\n\nA: For SysV Services\nMake sure that you follow the following steps while adding/creating new service in Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the service file in /etc/init.d/<service name>\n\n*chmod 700 /etc/init.d/<service name>\n\n*update-rc.d <service name> defaults\n\n*update-rc.d <service name> enable\nNow see you service in \nservice --status-all\n\n\nA: I've found that an error in the .conf file can make the job not recognizable to initctl. for example, having a setuid line in Upstart version 1.3 or earlier.\n\nA: While the current chosen answer is correct for getting the new service added to upstart, it's not particularly helpful for finding out WHY a config in /etc/init/ is failing to load -- the missing piece is using init-checkconf first to make sure your config is valid, and then using reload-configuration:\n####Test the new config - resolving any issues before continuing:\nERROR: File /etc/init/test.conf: syntax invalid:\ntest.conf:35: Unterminated quoted string\n\n####then fix and recheck:\n# init-checkconf /etc/init/test.conf\nFile /etc/init/test.conf: syntax ok\n\n####then reload:\n# initctl reload-configuration\n\n#### and start:\n# start test\n\n", "Q: System and Preferences Icon vanished from menu bar On my ubuntu12.04 screen launcher, System and Preferences Icon has got vanished..\nthere used to be system and preferences icon on left vertical panel(launcher), now that is not visible, How to add it again to menubar??\nright now i am using \" gnome-control-center \"this command to open that, but i want it back on launcher,\nthanks \n\nA: If you mean the icon locked to the launcher, a simple way would be to open the System and Preferences window from your dash (open the menu and type \"system\").

I may have seen icons corresponding to 64x64 and 128x128 being used but I'm not sure.\nBut what are all the other sizes for? Are they needed for very large screens?\n\nA: \nWhy do some icon themes have so many different sizes?\n\nSoftware often makes use of different icons thus it needs icons to be in different sizes. The difference in sizes can be attributed to the context within the software they're used, for example: Icons for the toolbars don't need to be at 512x512  whereas icons in a dock or menu need to be at a higher size.\nAlso, icons need to be scaled properly so they don't lose their meaning.\nSo artists make use of the different sizes for this. An icon created in 512x512 will look good at 100% scaling and probably at 50% but at 12.5% (64x64) the same icon will look bad, details will be lost, it may look like something completely different, etc; so another icon specifically made for that size needs to be created.\nLooking around I found that Gnome has a specification for the sizes:\n\nI'd add to this that this is specifically for Gnome icons (mostly in SVG) and maybe the Tango and Tango-based icons though the table looks quite dated as Gnome includes icons larger than that nowadays and doesn't mention symbolic icons. \nSo depending on the artist these may be very well vary.\nI generally group icons in the following sizes (size of the canvas) according to the context in which they will be used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contextual Menus, Toolbars, Mimetypes (very small), Mounted Devices (Nautilus sidebar).\n\n\n*\n\n*16x16\n\n*22x22\n\n*24x24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Mimetypes (small-medium), Docks, Categorized Menus (Unity's Dash, Gnome Shell's application overview, System preferences), Desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*32x32\n\n*48x48\n\n*64x64\n\n*96x96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Mimetypes (large), Docks, Categorized Menus (Unity's Dash, Gnome Shell's application overview)\n\n\n*\n\n*128x128\n\n*256x256\n\n*512x512\n\n\n\nA: The icons are used by multiple features in the unity system, and in all desktop environments, each choosing the size of the icon best suitable.\nThe sidebar, for example, uses a smaller icon than used by the application switcher (pressing alt+tab shows very large icons, it uses 256x256).\n", "Q: Ubuntu sudo not working I wanted to move a file to a /usr/python2.7/ but i was unable to do so, so i changed the permissions of /usr to myuser:\nsudo chown -R ***** /usr\n\nit worked but i realised it was a blunder when sudo stopped working after that.

Then change the ownership of that mounted partition:\nchown -R root:root /media/raring-root-disk/usr\nchmod -R a+rX /media/raring-root-disk/usr\n\nNote: I didn't test this, so the live-CD approach (though favoured by me) might not work. However, I can not see how it can harm your situation.

But if you're unsure, you're looking for the device which has the System column set to \"Linux\".\nOnce you know the partition that you're Ubuntu is installed into you, you need to mount it, replace /dev/sda1 with your device in the following:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/recover\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/recover\nsudo chmod -R root:root /mnt/recover/usr\nsudo chmod -R a+rX /mnt/recover/usr\nsudo umount /mnt/recover\n\n", "Q: 401 authorization in python 3 I need a little help with python3 code.\nI wrote a code for python2, but after a little modifications in python3,\nI can't get this code working again.\nCan you provide me any ideas, what and how can be done, to get this code working again?\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n#\n# python3 version http client\n# \n\nimport urllib.parse\nimport urllib.request\nimport time\n\nparam1 = 'value1'\nparam2 = 'value2'\n\ntm = 60\n\nwhile True:\n    url = \"http://a.w.com/?link=11&u=10\"\n    values = {'param1':value1, 'param2':value2}\n\n    data = urllib.parse.urlencode(values)\n    binary_data = data.encode('ascii')\n    req = urllib.request.Request(url, binary_data)\n    urllib.request.urlopen(req)\n\n    # find only cmd output:\n    result = re.search('Wireless(.*)</div>', data)\n    print (result.group(1))\n\nCode seems to be ok, but I need to add here basic auth login functionality.\nI know that in Python 3 auth was changed to oauth, but I don't know how\nshould I prepare this code to working.\nAny idea is welcome.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you are trying to do but if any idea is welcome I'd suggest using requests instead of urllib.\nhttp://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html\nIf you need authentication ideas, they are here for you.\nhttp://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/authentication.html\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.04 failed to start any GUI application as root I just installed ubuntu 13.04 in family machine, and I faced strange problem\neven though my sudo password is correct, I cannot start any GUI application (i.e. bleachBit (as root)) as a root, the system will not except my password.

This is creating me problem with upgrading to newer kernels as I have /boot partition of just 96MB. What can I do to reduce the size of this file?\n\nA: In /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf, set MODULES=dep instead of MODULES=most. The initrd build process will work out what modules you need rather than including a wide variety of things. Note, however, that this makes your boot process very dependent on your hardware and if you need to use a different set of hardware (in particular, drives) the initrd may not work.\nAdditionally you can choose a better compression algorithm, the default should still be gzip, but xz (or lzma2) is also available via COMPRESS=xz. Of course you need to have xz-utils installed. The initial compression takes longer, but decompression during boot shouldn't take much longer. Both options together may also reduce your boot time a little bit.\nAfter setting this, run sudo update-initramfs -u -k all to have it take effect.\n", "Q: Mozilla Thunderbird spellcheck has too many listed languages When I write an email in Mozilla, the spellcheck shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*21 entries for Spanish (Cuba, Ecuador, Spain ...)\n\n*3 entries for English (Australia, UK, US)\n\n*4 entries for French (modern, classic, reform, classic/reform)\n\n\nIs there a way to make it show up only the ones I am interested in (for example, Spanish (Spain), English(US), French(modern))?\nIt is very uncomfortable to search for the language I need among them all. \nI found this bug report: lp#651586 but seems it is not solved.

For a desktop installation in a new and shiny laptop (let's say 16gb ram and ssd hd), does it make sense to have a swap partition?\n\nA: Is this a theoretical question or a practical one?\nIn practice, there's almost no reason to avoid a swap partition because disk space is cheap and plentiful (especially on shiny new laptops).\nOn paper, it might seem that 16GB of memory will never be used up. Consider these circumstances:\n\n\n*\n\n*certain programs (e.g. video editors, LibreOffice) use an exorbitant amount of pages when starting up for initialization, then never used again\n\n*unforeseen circumstances: a program going crazy, a fork bomb\n\n\nNow consider them happening at the same time. A swap partition will serve as a buffer when unpredictable events line up, buying you some time before the system crashes to save work, etc.\nSpecifically because have a laptop, there will come a time when hibernation saves your skin. Perhaps you will leave your computer for a coffee break, but something comes up and you, instead, return an hour later. If your battery picks that moment to die, hibernation will protect your unsaved work.\n\nA: You can make a swap file instead and hibernate with it too, I have made swap files on my laptop so I can hibernate each of my linux installations.  Otherwise hibernate would just overwrite the last hibernation if I was using one swap partition.  This is my method.  Notice you must hibernate using the kernel method: echo disk > /sys/power/state\nsudo -s \nfallocate -l 4000m /swap_file  #4000 mb, may want higher than 4000mb\nswapoff -a\n\nmkswap /swap_file\n\nnano /etc/fstab\n#delete previous swap entry then add\n/swap_file   swap    swap    defaults        0       0\n#then save and exit\n\nswap-offset /swap_file  #remember the output of this\nnano /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nadd to linux line:    resume=<partition swapfile is on> resume_offset=<swap-offset return data>\n\nswapon -a\nnano /home/name/bin/hibernate_shutdown\n#!/bin/bash\necho shutdown > /sys/power/disk\necho disk > /sys/power/state\n\ncreate shortcut. system-settings->keyboard->shortcuts->custom shortcuts  add\ngnomesu /home/name/bin/hibernate_shutdown\nset to F11\nchmod +x /home/name/bin/hibernate_shutdown\nrestart computer\n\nviola\nif you want to restart after hibernate instead of shutdown\necho reboot > /sys/power/disk\necho disk > /sys/power/state\n\n\nA: \nYes you need swap, if you just use it for suspend and minor swap actions a swap file somewhere on your disk might be fine, And i been using swap file from almost a year never ever had problem with it, just don't like partitioning the disk.\n\nJust copy paste the following line in terminal and it will create 2 GB of swap. First become root:\nsudo su\n\nThen copy and paste pate the following (as always, make sure you understand what you are pasting on your terminal):\nmkdir /swap && \\\ncd /swap && \\\nfallocate -l 2g 2GB.swap && \\\nmkswap 2GB.swap && \\\nswapon 2GB.swap && \\\necho \"# # # Swap File # # #\" >> /etc/fstab && \\\necho \"/swap/2GB.swap none swap sw 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab && \\\nmount -a\n\nSwap (partition vs file) for performance\nDown Side \nYou cannot hibernate to swap file, as mentioned by @Takkat, I have check and i have 1st time in my life try to hibernate but its not working, so if you want to hibernate yo need swap partition, otherwise  if swap file is good to go. \nHibernate vs. Suspend \n\nA: If you want to be able to hibernate, then yes, it is necessary to have a swap partition at least as large as your total RAM.\nApart from that, if you have 16GB of RAM then in principle probably not - I've seen people saying that 1GB is plenty to run without swap, though I imagine it would boil down to a matter of opinion for many people. In my case, I'm running a laptop with 8GB RAM and have a swap the same size for hibernation purposes (with the side-effect that it provides a buffer if my work becomes particularly memory-intensive, as it can do sometimes)\n\nA: Well, for over a year I have not partitioned my SSD and also have no swap file. I have been using the same SSD (512 GB) in two different notebooks. The older one had 8GB RAM, the newer has 16 GB. I use the RAM for temporary files and Firefox Cache and with the 8 GB I sometimes noticed the system getting slow when syncing huge files with grsync. Now with 16 GB RAM (and maybe also newer Ubuntu version 13.04) I have not encountered any problems whatsoever. Also I believe that partitioning is not good for SSDs and is a way of wasting expensive storage.\nSo I only can speak from my experience with SSD/16GB RAM: with this constellation I would certainly not use SWAP and even with 8GB RAM I was ok. Hibernation has been buggy anyway and Standby is much faster\n", "Q: Could someone improve kernel upgrade scripts with VirtualBox install? Ubuntu kernel updates are very frequent.

I always remove just about everything I can - I actually only use the app and file lens', I don't use any of the others so I remove them. I'm not going to use the smart scopes because I don't want information being sent to 3rd parties (even Canonical). \nI like Unity so I would like to keep using Unity, but I just want to remove smart scopes... There are going to be a lot of them I know, which means that the list to remove is going to be long, but Synaptic or a quick bit of sudo apt-get purge should take care of that. \nThere are the privacy controls there which will let me prevent the smart scopes from working, but I want to remove them. \nSo the question is simple... Can the smart scopes be removed? Can I still just leave the app and file lens' locally without any of the smart scope stuff.\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.10 and up: Instead of removing, try disabling?\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Application Scope (Super+A).\n\n*Scroll down to Dash plugins.\n\n*Select “See X more results”\n\n*Click on the Scope you want to disable.\n\n*Click “Disable”.\n\n\nTip: Toggle multiple scopes at a time using the left and right arrows in the Dash interface.\n\nA: Although strongly discouraged, you can remove all individual scopes and turn the online results off in the Privacy settings. This will effectively turn off smart scopes, as there will be no scopes other than the default ones to return search results for.\nScopes are shipped as individual packages (generally named unity-scope-* or unity-lens-*), so you can uninstall each one of them. Here you've got a list of the default scopes on a desktop installation.\nAgain, this answer is provided to share the knowledge on scopes, but I'd strongly recommend not to mess around with such an essential part of the system such as scopes. As with any other central part of Ubuntu, removing them might cause system instability.\n\nA: You can blacklist offending scopes in one swoop using the Terminal. The following command, from FixUbuntu, should do the trick:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Lenses disabled-scopes \"['more_suggestions-amazon.scope', 'more_suggestions-u1ms.scope', 'more_suggestions-populartracks.scope', 'music-musicstore.scope', 'more_suggestions-ebay.scope', 'more_suggestions-ubuntushop.scope', 'more_suggestions-skimlinks.scope']\"\n\nTo re-enable you only need to run the command:\n  gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Lenses enabled-scopes \"['more_suggestions-amazon.scope', 'more_suggestions-u1ms.scope', 'more_suggestions-populartracks.scope', 'music-musicstore.scope', 'more_suggestions-ebay.scope', 'more_suggestions-ubuntushop.scope', 'more_suggestions-skimlinks.scope']\"\n\nyou may need to reboot to make the change\n", "Q: My process is already daemonized before calling fork I am starting process with upstart, to run as service using following command but looks like before i call the fork in main() of testservice it's already running as daemon.

Simply exec testservice.\n", "Q: Is it possible to put X to sleep, leaving the rest of the system awake? Imagine a computer with two functions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A fileserver and local webserver, required 24/7.\n\n*A graphical server for a media centre, only required when somebody is using it.\n\n\nI am considering building such a machine so allow me to kick some of the disks out of my incredibly power-hungry desktop and replacing our slow 2nd-gen Atom media centre.\nThe problem with this build is XBMC is a power-eating beast. Left to its own devices, the CPU will never enter anything even close to a sleep state. Things have improved but the only way to be efficient is to put it in S3 sleep. Obviously this shuts down anything running. We currently wake over USB (a IR receiver).\nS3 Sleep wouldn't be possible on new machine because I would want it running server things but, I'd like to put the X server (and all its clients) to sleep. If that's possible. Is it?\nFailing that, I can always quit X but that would lose XBMC's state and I'd rather avoid that. If that's the only method, can you suggest a way to reinitialise X from an IR command? (And in a way that doesn't clash with XBMC's handling of IR).\nNote: I'm completely flexible with the graphical stack. It's currently just X and nodm loading a standalone version of XBMC but if what you need requires something else, that's fine. I'm also able to test this ahead of building a new machine (on the current one).\n\nA: Pausing a process tree\nI'm halfway there. I found kill -STOP <PID> which freezes a process. There's a CONT version too which wakes it up. Therefore I can find and STOP the nodm process tree with this sexy command:\npstree -p $(ps ux | awk '/nodm$/ {print $2}') | grep -oP '\\d+' | xargs kill -STOP\n\nAnd we can wake all stopped processes (for the current user) with:\nps ux | awk '$8 ~ /^T/ {print $2}' | xargs kill -CONT\n\nThis actually seems to work. I've just tested it and I'm amazed that neither X, XBMC or the file it's playing over NFS (yeah this works mid-video) seem to mind that it's being paused for five minutes.\nResuming from IR\nThis was the next challenge - how could I restart these processes from IR? For this we need irexec which can run a arbitrary command for any button, regardless of what else is listening to lirc.\nWe need a few scripts in place to make this happen. First ~/.lircrc\nbegin\nprog = irexec\nbutton = *\nconfig = ~/.resume &\nend\n\nand ~/.resume (this will need chmod +x ~/.resume running after it's created)\n#!/bin/sh\nps ux | awk '$8 ~ /^T/ {print $2}' | xargs kill -CONT\n\nThen all we need to do is load irexec. To keep it from being zombified when the STOP command is run, we have to shunt the process out of the current tree which is made simple with setsid. In my case, I add the following before xbmc's launcher in ~/.xsession:\nsetsid irexec\n\nThe final mystery: How can I get XBMC to run the STOP script instead of sleeping?\nThe only part I haven't solved now is getting XBMC to run a command instead of shutting down. Work in progress. The only option I can find at the moment is creating a custom Python screensaver for XBMC which seems really dull (and I can't get it working).\n\nA: I'm not xbmc specialist but if it uses Lirc to catch IR messages you could add something like this to the ~/.licrc or /etc/lirc/lircrc files to trigger your scripts.\n  begin wakeupwait\n       button = OK (of course you may prefer to use another button for that purpose) \n       prog = irexec\n       config = <your wake-up script path>\n       quit\n  end wakeupwait\n\n  begin\n       button = OK (same button) \n       prog = irexec\n       config = <your pause script path>\n       mode = wakeupwait\n  end\n\nsome documents: \nirexec http://www.lirc.org/html/irexec.html\n.lircrc http://www.lirc.org/html/configure.html\n(mode option is worth to read)\nEmmanuel\n", "Q: How can I use the backspace character as a backspace when entering a password?

This included a short C program to demonstrate it. I also had emails with David Mills about similar issues with NTP- the Network Time Protocol. On my Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit laptop the perl code did not exhibit the limitation so the underlying 64-bit libs must have been modified.\nHowever, running my long-ago test code does show the time wraps back to the UNIX Epoch. So not all is well with the 32-bit code from the past.\nMy 1996 paper, The UNIX time will run out in 2038! has been on my website since around 2000. A variant of this titled \"UNIX Time\" was published in 1998 in \"Year 2000 Best Practices for Y2K Millennium Computing\" ISBN 0136465064.\n\nA: 64-bit Linux is ready, at least if you are talking about the core OS interfaces (individual applications can of course still screw it up). time_t is traditionally defined as an alias for \"long\" and \"long\" on 64-bit linux is 64-bit.\nThe situation for 32-bit Linux (and the compatibility layer for 32-bit binaries on 64-bit Linux) is much less rosy. It's broken and fixing it  without breaking all existing binaries is not an easy task. A whole bunch of APIs use time_t and in many cases it is embedded as part of data structures, so not only must the APIs be duplicated the data structures they work with must be too.\nEven if there is some level of backwards compatibility all binaries that want to get correct time will need to be rebuilt to use the new 64-bit time interfaces. \nThere has been some work done (see for example https://lwn.net/Articles/643234/ and http://www.sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2015-10/msg00893.html) but afaict we are still a long way from a full solution. It is not clear whether or not there will ever be general purpose 32-bit distributions that are Y2K38 safe. \n\nA: No, it will not fail. In the worst case, from the viewpoint of a programmer it will work as expected: it will be reseted to date 1901-12-13 20:45:52:\n\nThis in case you will not update your current distributions until this happens. \"Updating is easy. One of these updates will surely contain a fix.\" like chocobai said.\nI remember that it was the same problem/question with 16-bit machines before 2000 and in the end it wasn't any problems.\nA solution from Wikipedia: \n\nMost operating systems designed to run on 64-bit hardware already use signed 64-bit time_t integers. Using a signed 64-bit value introduces a new wraparound date that is over twenty times greater than the estimated age of the universe: approximately 292 billion years from now, at 15:30:08 on Sunday, 4 December 292,277,026,596. The ability to make computations on dates is limited by the fact that tm_year uses a signed 32 bit int value starting at 1900 for the year. This limits the year to a maximum of 2,147,485,547 (2,147,483,647 + 1900). While this solves the problem for executing programs, it does not solve the problem of storing date values within binary data files, many of which employ rigid storage formats. It also doesn't solve the problem for 32-bit programs running under compatibility layers and may not solve the problem for programs that incorrectly store time values in variables of types other than time_t.\n\nI use Ubuntu 13.04 on 64-bit and, by curiosity, I changed manually the time to 2038-01-19 03:13:00. After 03:14:08 nothing had happened:\n\n\nSo there is nothing to be concerned about this problem.\nMore about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Year 2038 problem - Wikipedia.\n\n*End of Time (Unix) - Numberphile.\n\n", "Q: Postfix: Require login before sending email How can I configure my postfix to require the user to log in before sending email ?

(Greenish screen) I installed latest Ubuntu (13.04). If I check from system settings I get that Im using Galllium 0.4 drivers for RS690. I have an ATI card, ATI Radeon X1270...\nEvery time I open some window or ubuntu is trying to show me some kind of an effect, it hangs a lot. If I open launcher I get this as pictured above. I assume the grene things is transparency.\nDO I need new drivers to be installed or what is the solution?\n\n\nA: You don't have to install new drivers. Proprietary drivers from AMD (fglrx) are not available for your X1270 any more (unless you go back to Ubuntu 8.04).\nThis is a known bug of Ubuntu 13.04 with RS690 graphic cards. However, there is a workaround. This askubuntu post contains an answer. You have to disable Dash Blur with compiz-config-settings-manager or a similar application.\nThe Bug-report can be found here on launchpad.\n\nA: Try disabling proprietry drivers and use generic drivers.\n", "Q: How to clear bad sectors in hard disk using ubuntu My hard disk has developed more than 1200 bad sectors and it is failing to install any operating system. I am using ubuntu 12.04 through my pen drive. I need to zero fill my hard disk. Please advice. \n\nA: Well you have a lot of bad sectors.  My advise is to replace the drive.  But if you still want to mark those bad sectors, then you can use fsck.  fsck is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux file systems.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo fsck /dev/sd*  (replace * with your device ID)\n\nNote:  When dealing with any hard drive issue please make sure that you have a current backup of all you information.\nThe \"fsck\" command stands for \"file system check\"; it scans the disk for bad sectors and labels the ones that aren't working.\nIf you want to zero out the drive, just follow Piskvor's answer.\n\nA: To answer your specific question: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX will overwrite disk /dev/sdX with zeroes. Use with caution; there is no \"undo\" for this. \nTo address the underlying problem: if your hard disk has this many errors, it will fail catastrophically in the very near future, and you will lose anything that's written on it; replace it with a working one ASAP. Overwriting it with zeroes will not eliminate the bad sectors, and only postpones the problem.\n", "Q: Did not detect Micromax MMX353G netsetter I had Micromax MMX353G net setter, but it did not detecting on Ubuntu 12.04 onwards versions even in Ubuntu 13.04.

You can however, record to a WAV file. If you want a MIDI, you will have to hook up Zynaddsubfx to seq24 or a similar sequencer program, create a song, and save to MIDI from there. You will need to hook up Zynaddsubfx and the sequencer again, to play the song, as playback with other software may result in slightly different instruments being used, and thus a different sound than what you were hoping to record.\n\nA: Some details to save to wav on Ubuntu 20.04, zynaddsubfs 3.0.5, the interface is atrocious:\nzynaddsubfx -O alsa\n\nthen:\n\n*\n\n*Misc\n\n*Switch User interface mode (moves to \"advanced mode\")\n\n*Record\n\n*Choose wav file\n\nAfter this, the record button becomes enabled.\nSo you can now open a virtual keyboard with the vK button, and it then records the wav.\nHowever, stopping the recording did not actually stop it for me, I have to actually close Zyn for it to stop.\nAlso I don't know how to automate this.\nHopefully the new interface zyn-fusion will be easier to use, and will someday get ported into debian.\nTo get a midi file, you could use vmpk as mentioned here: Save as MIDI when playing from VMPK & QSynth You can plug it into zynaddsubfx exactly as it is plugged into fluidsynth as explained at: Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard setup\nRelated: https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=229567\nLMMS ZynAddSubFX plugin\nJust want to say that this is a really simple way to make MIDI tracks with Zyn.

Everything works fine, but there's a detail that's getting on my nerves.\nEvery time i receive a kernel update, i have to re-install virtual box's guest additions. Is there a way to automate this besides skipping the update (i found information on that approach here ). Is there  a way to keep up with kernel updates without reinstalling the guest additions every time?\nThanks,\n\nA: Quoting the VirtualBox User Manual:\n\nBe sure to install DKMS before installing the Linux Guest Additions.\n  If DKMS is not available or not installed, the guest kernel modules\n  will need to be recreated manually whenever the guest kernel is\n  updated using the command\n/etc/init.d/vboxadd setup as root.\n\n[...]\n\nIf it is not installed, use this command for Ubuntu/Debian systems:\nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\n\nA: If you are using Vagrant to manage your Virtualbox VMs, you can install the vagrant-vbguest plugin to automatically detect out-of-date guest additions and update them.\n", "Q: After installing 'mesa', Ubuntu doesn't start up Firstly, i've deleted /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nAnd then tried below command to install mesa on Ubuntu 12.04.2.\nsudo apt-get install libglapi-mesa && sudo apt-get install libosmesa6\n\nAfter reboot computer, Ubuntu doesn't start up !

Dell Laptop fan running excessivly I recently updated to Ubuntu 13.04 on a Dell laptop. I did not have this problem with the previous version.\nNormally the fan is not running.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 lts. But I figured I could give it a try. It did not work, I have been searching the web for directions or solutions on what actions I could take but I am coming up short. \nIs someone else having this problem? If so can you help me with this or point me in the right direction. \n\nA: Hardware needs Drivers to work. To write a Driver you need basic knowledge about the Hardware. Since Cisco did not create OpenSource Drivers nor Linux Drivers nor openens up the Specs for this device, only a Hardcore Linux Developer could spend much time to analyse the Hardware and then write an OpenSource Driver for it. If the best people begin now, you will have a beta driver in a year or two.\nTo be clear: That will not happen. You should inform yourself before buying and only buy Linux compatible Hardware. It is a market Problem with the manufacturers. Help to solve this issue by reporting back to cisco, give your dongle back and get a new, linux compatible, one.\nTip: If a Hardware is advertised with \"No Driver install needed\" or similar, than chance is high, that a standard is used and it will work without any additional drivers on Win,Mac,Linux. Search for WiFi Dongles that explicit work with Linux BEFORE buying one. There are lots of them.

My goal is to create a custom launcher that will launch a specific VirtualBox virtual machine, and I'd like it to have it's own icon.\nFrom a purely functional standpoint, I've been successful.  This article (webupd8.org) gave me a command that directly launches a virtual machine.  So I created a new .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications that uses that command for the 'Exec' portion.  When I click the launcher, the machine successfully launches.\nMy problem is with the icon behavior.  I specified a custom icon in the .desktop file, and it shows up beautifully in my favorites bar.  However, when I click the icon and the virtual machine starts up, the newly-opened window isn't associated with my custom launcher (i.e., my custom icon isn't \"highlighted\").  Instead, the window becomes associated with a newly-created VirtualBox icon.\nDoes anyone know if there's a way to indicate to GNOME 3 that I want to associate the new window with my custom icon?  I remember having a similar issue with Matlab and specifying something called \"StartupWMClass\" in the .desktop file, but I don't know what I should set the value to in this case (or if that even applies for a non-Matlab launcher).\nHere's my .desktop file in case anyone thinks it might prove useful:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Windows 8\nGenericName=Windows 8 Virtual Machine\nComment=Windows 8 in VirtualBox\nExec=VBoxManage startvm 'Windows 8'\nIcon=/home/username/Pictures/Icons/Windows8.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Office;\n\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm using latest GNOME 3.10 on fedora 20 and  StartupWMClass=VirtualBox seems to do the trick.\nPerhaps it was fixed since the time you asked the question? \nAnyway, VirtualBox still has one drawback - all windows has the same WM_CLASS. So if you're running several machines they will be grouped together. I've filed a bug report for this: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12534 . Hopefully we'll see it resolved soon.\n\nA: I have found a good workaround.\nMy windows.desktop launcher:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Windows 10 VM\nGenericName=Windows 10 Virtual Machine\nComment=Windows 10 in VirtualBox\n\nExec=/home/admin/.local/share/applications/windows.sh\nIcon=/home/admin/.local/share/applications/windows.png\nStartupWMClass=Windows\n\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Office;\n\nMy windows.sh file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nvirtualbox --startvm agromov-vm &\nVM_PID=$!\nsleep 1\nxprop -id $(wmctrl -lp | grep $VM_PID | cut -d ' ' -f 1) -f WM_CLASS 8s -set WM_CLASS 'Windows'\n\n\"agromov-vm\" is the virtual machine name\nwmctrl is getting window id without mouse pointer\n\nA: Just for the reference, the limitation mentioned by @atitoxic in his answer has already been fixed in VirtualBox >= 5.2.0 thanks to his bug report. However, VirtualBox assigns a generic value to WM_CLASS by default (\"VirtualBox Machine\" in the last version at the time of writing which is 6.0.14). To enable this feature, extra data\nGUI/DistinguishMachineWindowGroups must be set to true using VBoxManage:\nVBoxManage setextradata <uuid|name> GUI/DistinguishMachineWindowGroups true\n\n<uuid|name> is either the UUID or the name of the VM. It can also be set to global to enable the feature for all VMs globally.\nAfter this, VirtualBox should assign a WM_CLASS value containing the UUID of the VM. You can verify it using xprop WM_CLASS.\n", "Q: Litecoin mining, AMD Overdrive I'm setting up a mining rig using 3-7950's, and have ran into a little bit of a road block.

Can someone post the proper syntax? I have tried using the chmod command , but I am doing something incorrectly. I am just trying to move a centos iso file to /images to set up a test vm\n\nA: I know it's an old post but I wanted to share what I did.\nIn my case, I needed to import a qcow2 image into a volume. I've used jq, qemu-img and and bash:\n# export IMGSIZE=$(qemu-img info --output json /data/myfile.qcow2 | jq -r .[\\\"virtual-size\\\"])\n# export IMGFMT=$(qemu-img info --output json /data/myfile.qcow2 | jq -r .format)\n\nList the pools and select the one you want:\n# virsh pool-list --all\n Name                 State      Autostart\n-------------------------------------------\n default              active     yes\n\n# export IMGPOOL=default\n\nCreate the volume:\n# virsh vol-create-as $IMGPOOL myvolume $IMGSIZE --format $IMGFMT\nVol myvolume created\n\nAnd upload the image:\n# virsh vol-upload --pool $IMGPOOL myvolume /data/myfile.qcow2\n\nI don't know if you can pipe qemu-img to virsh, sort of like 'qemu-img dd ... | virsh vol-upload ...'  but that would be convenient :-)\nThanks @Robie Basak for his post,  I've used it to write the information above.\n\nA: I assume two things: /var/lib/libvirt/images/ is owned by root and you are not root. That's fine but you have to respect that's what the problem is.\nIt would probably make most sense to just copy the file over as root, using sudo:\nsudo cp my-image /var/lib/libvirt/images/\n\nAlternatively, you can take over /var/lib/libvirt/images/:\nsudo chown $USER /var/lib/libvirt/images/\n\nOr (least good) you could just make it globally writable:\nsudo chmod 755 $USER /var/lib/libvirt/images/\n\nI'd follow the logic that it's root for a reason but if you're just playing around and this is never going to be a production machine, you probably don't need to be that careful.\n\nA: You're not really \"supposed\" to do it that way, since libvirt takes care of its own volume pools. Use:\nsize=$(stat -Lc%s centos.iso)\nvirsh vol-create-as default centos $size --format raw\nvirsh vol-upload --pool default centos centos.iso\n\nThis will create a virsh volume called centos in the default pool with the contents of centos.iso.\nThis way, libvirt takes care of all the required permissions and ownership itself.\n\nA: You can try doing it in nautilus\njust type\nsudo -i nautilus\n\nand after that copy the file as you would normally do.\n", "Q: Making websites visible to outside networks with Ubuntu Server 12.04 I am a new Ubuntu Server user, and I need some assistance in setting it up.\nI am using Ubuntu Server 12.04 64-bit.\nThis is my main question: How can I set up Ubuntu Server to host a website that is visible from networks besides my own?\nI have seen and read multiple tutorials on how to set up Ubuntu Server, but all of them show you how to set it up to host websites on a LAN. In the setup processes I have seen, only the standard assigned IP addresses such as 192.168.0.180...have been used.... These processes would work for hosting on a LAN...but, if I go outside of my LAN, the hosted website would probably not be seen by typing in the IP addresses of 192.168.0.180:xxxx....\nThe computer that will run the server is attached to my home network's router.\nHow do I configure Ubuntu Server to make the websites that it hosts visible from other outside networks?\nIf somebody could clue me in on what I'm missing or direct me to a good tutorial on this, I would be very grateful.\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Almost completely unrelated to Ubuntu but there you go...\n\n\n*\n\n*Forward port 80 to your Ubuntu's internal IP, using your router and this guide.\n\n*Tell Ubuntu to unblock port 80 (might not be needed):\nsudo ufw allow tcp/80\n\nBy this point people outside your network should be able to put your IP in their browser and see the site. This won't work internally due to routers' routing restrictions so don't consider that a fault. Test with something outside the network.\nFor bonus points (and if your legal IP is dynamic):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a service like DynDNS to point a domain name at your IP\n\n*CNAME a real domain onto your DynDNS name with a short TTL.\n\n*Make sure the Apache config expects these domains (or you're using a wildcard/default host)\n\n*Set your /etc/hosts to shortcut the DNS so it looks locally rather than your legal IP:\n127.0.0.1    mydomain.com\n\nIf you have a truly static IP assigned to you by your ISP (some residential ISPs still do this), you can just point your domain at it with a long TTL.\n\nA: Find what kind of router you have, then go to it's IP. It should have something like \"Port-forwarding\" or \"Virtual Firewalls\" in the menu.

Not 100% sure if the hw_params file is specific to hda_intel, or if it'll be there with whatever alsa driver you have.\nIn a typical setup, applications use the default ALSA output, which is actually a hook to send the audio through pulseaudio, which itself outputs to hardware through alsa, using the actual names of the hw device.  (alsa devices are specified with text strings like hw:0, or default).\n\nA: Pulseaudio settings adhere to the sink they are made for.

Now do gksu bleachbit, or whatever GUI application you want to run as root, and type your password (the one you use for updating and installing)\n\nA: Probably it is a wrong password for root as there is no root password.\nBy default administrative tasks are done with \"sudo\" command (either in command line interface or in the background) and that means they are run with \"root-level privileges\" but still by your normal user with normal users password. By default root account is not even activated and if possible one should not activate it. \nSo, root password is not supposed to be the same as the password you enter for Software center or when you run commands with sudo in the command line. That is, with the password of the regular user. If that user has administrative rights his/hers password is asked when he/she wants to do anything with administrative rights. Root account is a separate account that has its own separate password. As its no activated by default then by default no root password exist. \nWithout activating root account you can get to the root command line by typing \"sudo su\". But if you are literally asked for root password then it is impossible to give the right answer (if you have not activated root account and assigned password to it). \nTry removing the programmes that ask for root password and reinstall them as the regular user with sudo. Remember \"sudo\" means regular user with administrative rights and \"root\" means the \"superuser\" that is a separate user. Usually when user is prompted for root password the problem is that something was install \"as root\" (not the same \"as sudo\") and later those files are being executed or opened by the regular user. That makes it a file permissions issue.\nFor an example read this. It is a good example how root and sudo can get mixed up if you don't know what is what.\nRead more about sudo and root in Ubuntu here.\n\nA: Ordinarilly you would use gksu instead of sudo to launch gui programs, but as demure said in notes above, this has been deprecated, and you should use pkexec now instead.\nBy default this does not support gui programs however.  So you need to configure them to run.  Once configured you will be able to run them from the command line using:\npkexec bleachbit\n\nTo configure you need to edit\\create the file /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.policykit.pkexec.policy.  For example, using nano...\npkexec nano /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.policykit.pkexec.policy\n\nYou then, for the programs you specify, need to add the following content to the file...\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE policyconfig PUBLIC \"-//freedesktop//DTD PolicyKit Policy Configuration 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/PolicyKit/1/policyconfig.dtd\">\n<policyconfig>\n\n<action id=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.pkexec.run-gedbi\">\n<description>Run gedbi</description>\n<message>Authentication is required to run gedbi</message>\n<defaults>\n  <allow_any>no</allow_any>\n  <allow_inactive>no</allow_inactive>\n  <allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>\n</defaults>\n<annotate key=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path\">/usr/sbin/gedbi</annotate>\n<annotate key=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.allow_gui\">TRUE</annotate>\n</action>\n\n<action id=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.pkexec.run-bleachbit\">\n<description>Run bleachbit</description>\n<message>Authentication is required to run bleachbit</message>\n<defaults>\n  <allow_any>no</allow_any>\n  <allow_inactive>no</allow_inactive>\n  <allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>\n</defaults>\n<annotate key=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path\">/usr/sbin/bleachbit</annotate>\n<annotate key=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.allow_gui\">TRUE</annotate>\n</action>\n\n</policyconfig>\n\nYou can add additional programs in this way, or if you prefer, there is a bash script for adding additional programs to the config file automatically.\n\nA: you need to eyther use gksu or create root password. personaly I do consider sudoers as security issue as most people use one main profile inside sudoers and as such it is likely to have asier password.\nlets not go into debate (flame) about that.\nif you insist in using su instead of sudo you need o set root password  using sudo passwd\nalternatively file a bug against their packers for using su rather then sudo (gksu) though\nNote if it is supprising for me to hear that is asking for root rather then your password.\n", "Q: Opening a track with Banshee How can I open a track with Banshee using command line? Obviously banshee file.mp3 don't work. Is there another command?\nSee what I'm trying to accomplish is to make puddletag to play tracks in banshee.

I don't know how to fix this can anyone help? Like I said it worked fine last night and when I turned it on today it gave me this. \nMy computer is a dell studio xps that has dual boot to windows 8. \n\nA: Boot with Ubuntu live CD or live USB, assuming you have one, and see if you can even mount the main Ubuntu partition on your hard drive. If you can, unmount it.\nNow install GSmartControl on the live CD/live USB. Start up GSmartControl after install and look at the S.M.A.R.T. attributes of your hard drive.\nIf nothing highlighted in pink for your HDD, that's good. The drive probably isn't failing.\nNext, you can run e2fsck on the / partition of your hard drive. Maybe there's some corruption you can clean up. You want the partition not mounted before running this. Go into a terminal and run sudo fdisk -l to find out which partition it is if you aren't sure. Then (let's assume it's /dev/sda1) type:\nsudo e2fsck /dev/sda1\nand see if it's not clean - and maybe it will fix some stuff. If there is serious corruption, you may be asked to fix a lot of stuff. There's an option in e2fsck to say 'yes to everything' - but if you get that many problems, you probably won't be booting this thing again, anyway.\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2112153.\n", "Q: Executing command line with other user I'm struggling with a problem, i'm using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, i have a command line \"wvdial brt\" wich i need to execute with every boot from my computer, i have 2 users in my computer and i have to execute this command from any of them, i tried to include this command in /etc/rc.local but when i log in with the another user the command doesn't work, is there any other place more recommended to insert this command line? i'm doing something wrong?\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Run gedit ~/.config/autostart/wvdial.desktop logged in as the first user and paste the following code inside the file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=wvdial brt\nName=WVDIAL\n\nRepeat the process logged in as the second user.

I wouldn't like to lose all my files, and know that it would be easy to back up all the files temorariliy and then do a fresh install. However, since Linux distros tends to use the same structure generally (e.g. using /usr, /home, etc) would it be possible to just change the operating system without having to overwrite these things?\nThank you!\n\nA: No, although the file names and directory structure is similar, it is not exact across distros. In addition the libs are again similar, but different enough that you can not preserve all your system files.\nObviously some system files are going to be the same, but not enough similarity to do as you propose.\nBest to back up your data in $HOME and any system files you edited.\nWhy not dual boot,try running a new distro live, see if you like it. Or use virtualization such as KVM or Virtualbox?\n\nA: I know this is probably after the fact, but distro hopping is a really good reason for putting /home on it's own partition. Easiest solution for now and the future is to backup, install whatever distro you want (putting /home on it's own partition) and restoring. That way when you want to switch again you don't have to mess around too much.\n", "Q: No language switcher After (as I suppose) updating my Ubuntu 12.04 is refuses to change keyboard layout and only allows me to type in english.

Is there a workaround?\n\nA: The only workaround I found with Google Chrome is to disable PepperFlash in chrome://plugins and enable Shockwave Flash. That took care of the sound issue.

Ubuntu One on Windows 8 syncs this folder with a Windows 8 folder C:\\Users\\user_000\\Bureau, created by the Ubuntu One sync. However, in Windows 8, the default folder for the desktop view is C:\\Users\\user_000\\Desktop. Is this a bug or a configuration option in Ubuntu One?\nThanks.\n\nA: This is because you are using translated folder names for standard folders on Ubuntu. Ubuntu One does not rename folders when syncing to other devices. You will need to reconfigure your Windows system to point at the same folder, just sync both folders, or reconfigure Ubuntu to use untranslated folder names.\n", "Q: How to install 3rd party module so that it is loaded on boot? I have a third party module to go with a frame grabber.  I've downloaded the kernel source, followed the vendor's instructions to compile it, and have the resulting module, arvdrv.ko, sitting in a folder.\nThe vendor has supplied a script that loads the module into the kernel and it works when I run it; the module is loaded but only until the next boot.  The script does not use modprobe.  I can access the frame grabber when the module is installed.\nIt appears to me that modprobe maintains a list of many modules.  One can edit /etc/modules to add a module name and it will load at boot but the module arvdrv is not in modprobe's list.\nMy question is how to let modprobe know of the module?  Does it need to be copied to a new location and if so where?\n\nA: Using sudo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the /etc/modules file and add the name of the module (without the .ko extension) on its own line. On boot, the kernel will try to load all the modules named in this file.\n\n*Copy the module to a suitable folder in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers. In my case this was /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/pci. This will place the module in modprobe's database.  I don't know if this can be a link.\n\n*Run depmod.  This will find all the dependencies of your module.  \n\n*At this point, I rebooted and then run lsmod | grep module-name to confirm that the module was loaded at boot.\nSee the man pages for modprobe, lsmod, and depmod for more information.\n", "Q: Is the create disk image in the disks utility like clonezilla? In Ubuntu 13.04, the GUI disks utility has the \"create  disk image\" feature. Is it like a disk image that Clonezilla can produce ?\nIf yes, let say I save an image of my HDD which contains my OS to another HDD.\nAfter some time, if I'm not happy with the state of my OS, can I go back to the saved state using the restore disk image feature of the disks utility ?\n\nA: Create Disk Image feature is not yet completely as smart as things like GNU ddrescue, but saving an image using disks is like making an ISO file from a CD. Its great if you want to save them for long term archival, but it's not a disk-duplicator.\nMy personal opinion, from dealing with data recovey for quite some time, use something like Clonezilla or dd. \nI hope that this help.\n", "Q: How do I remove my old ubuntu installation and install a new install without affecting my Windows 8 install I have downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit for my laptop, as I installed 13.04 and I have quite a few bugs and errors. Since 12.04 is the most stable version and it's also LTS, I will stay with that one.\nI have a few questions though, since I'm still new to Ubuntu.  How can I install 12.04 and delete my 13.04 installation, without touching AT ALL my Windows 8 installation, as I am running dual boot, and installed 13.04 alongside Windows 8. \n\nA: If you boot the live CD of 12.04 and then start the install.  It will scan your disks and then should find 13.04 and then ask you if you want to \"Replace 13.04\" or do \"Something Else\".  \nSelecting to replace 13.04 will only affect the partition with Ubuntu already installed but.....\nIT WILL ERASE ALL FILES IN THE UBUNTU INSTALL!!!  If you want to keep any of these files you will need to back them up to another location BEFORE installing 12.04.\nIf you have installed 13.04 as encrypted, I'm not sure that it will be found. If that is the case you will(likely) need to delete the 13.04 partition manually and then try to install 12.04 from scratch with the liveCD installer.\nThe easiest way to do that is with OS-uninstaller This will need to be done with the liveCD/USB, if needed the community wiki page is here...   I will refer you to that page rather than just give you the instructions, the ones there are excellent and include screenshots as well.\nJust remember using either method will delete all the files on the Ubuntu partition so back them up first if you want to save them.  Neither will affect your Windows partition.\nNOTE:   if you are confused by the screen or you do not get the option to replace Ubuntu 13.04 with 12.04 Please do not do anything, just press cancel and then seek further help while the installer is pretty safe there are sometimes errors that usually come down to the operator not paying attention or being in a hurry and pressing buttons without reading them.\n", "Q: tail: inotify cannot be used, reverting to polling: Too many open files When I try to tail -f catalina.out, I get the error:\ntail: inotify cannot be used, reverting to polling: Too many open files \n\nI tried the answer in this post:\nToo many open files - how to find the culprit\nlsof | awk '{ print $2; }' | sort -rn | uniq -c | sort -rn | head\n\nWhen I ran the above command, the output was\n17 6115\n\n13 6413\n\n10 6417\n\n10 6415\n\n9 6418\n\n9 6416\n\n9 6414\n\n8 6419\n\n4 9 \n\n4 8\n\nI don't see any process having 1024 files open.

Probably, you're running some file synchronization tools(eg. Dropbox) in background?  \nIn Linux, the internal implementation of tail -f command uses the inotify mechanism by default, so as to monitor file changes.

If we are using initrd for, say in live usb, why would we also need squashfs?\n\nA: Initrd is deprecated and replaced by Initramfs (and to some extent upstart).\nWhat is the difference between initrd and initramfs?\nThe initramfs is more a part of the booting process and is a minimal file system used to bootstrap the kernel and initialize your hardware.\nsuqashfs is a compression tool and takes a large (5 Gb) file system and compresses it into a much smaller size, but it is ro.\nsquashfs is thus used for the entire file system, / and all the binaries and libs necessary to be Ubuntu live.\nSee also:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomizationFromScratch\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Initramfs\n\nInitramfs is used as the first root filesystem that your machine has access to. It is used for mounting the real rootfs which has all your data. The initramfs carries the modules needed for mounting your rootfs. \n\nHere is the initramfs I built http://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/initramfs/\nAnd \nhttp://squashfs.sourceforge.net/\n\nSquashfs is a compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed. \n\n\nA: squashfs vs compressed initramfs\nIt is also interesting to note that initramfs can also be compressed: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2221/can-the-initramfs-image-use-a-compression-format-other-than-gzip/429880#429880\nI think that the advantage of squashfs is that you don't have to do a full decompression on every boot for a huge image, which would be slow.\nThis is what initramfs does, as it is just a zipped .cpio.\nInstead, squashfs allows you to only decompresses files on the fly as you go, since it must separately compress individual files and disk data structures.\n", "Q: How do I get Unity panel, dash, and launcher back after kernel upgrade?

Is this an Ubuntu bug or an AMD Catalyst bug?  \n\nA: This worked for me. After messing around with getting the fglrx's installed and uninstalled from the Proprietary Drivers menu in gnome-control-center>software&updates, Unity was all gone and I just had the desktop (which had icons drawn on it, curiously). From that stage I ran sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx*, and restarted. Still no Unity. I then called google-chrome & and downloaded the proper driver from http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx. Then, as OP says, I ran dconf reset -f /org/compiz/ and a quick chmod +x driver_yadda_yadda.run and sudo ./driver_yadda_yadda.run, and it took me through the steps. After the prompted Install, everything is back to normal.\n\nA: What has worked best for me so far is to simply jump into tty1 with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and then reinstall fglrx. \nFor the stable version in the Ubuntu repositories:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall fglrx fglrx-amdcccle\n\nOr if you installed the updates version of AMD Catalyst:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates\n\nIf you installed manually from a file downloaded from AMD, then navigate to your downloads folder and run the install file again:\ncd ~/Downloads\nsh amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13-4-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/raring\n\nYou will need to change \"raring\" to precise, saucy, trusty, etc. if you have a different version of Ubuntu. \n", "Q: How to determine if a string is a substring of another in bash?

ARGV[0]'  \"ab\" \"abcdef\"                                             \nis substring\n\n\nA: Mind the [[ and \":\n[[ $a == z* ]]   # True if $a starts with an \"z\" (pattern matching).\n[[ $a == \"z*\" ]] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).\n\n[ $a == z* ]     # File globbing and word splitting take place.\n[ \"$a\" == \"z*\" ] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).\n\nSo as @glenn_jackman said, but mind that if you wrap the whole second term in double quotes, it will switch the test to literal matching.\nSource: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/comparison-ops.html\n\nA: [[ \"bcd\" =~ \"ab\" ]]\n[[ \"abc\" =~ \"ab\" ]] \nthe brackets are for the test, and as it is double brackets, it can so some extra tests like =~.\nSo you could use this form something like\nvar1=\"ab\"\nvar2=\"bcd\"\nif [[ \"$var2\" =~ \"$var1\" ]]; then\n    echo \"pass\"\nelse\n    echo \"fail\"\nfi\n\nEdit: corrected \"=~\", had flipped.\n\nA: Similar to edwin's answer, but with improved portability for posix & ksh, and a touch less noisy than Richard's:\nsubstring=ab\n\nstring=abc\nif [ \"$string\" != \"${string%$substring*}\" ]; then\n    echo \"$substring IS in $string\"\nelse\n    echo \"$substring is NOT in $string\"\nfi\n\nstring=bcd\nif [ \"$string\" != \"${string%$substring*}\" ]; then\n    echo \"$string contains $substring\"\nelse\n    echo \"$string does NOT contain $substring\"\nfi\n\nOutput:\nabc contains ab\nbcd does NOT contain ab\n\n\nA: You can use the form ${VAR/subs} where VAR contains the bigger string and\nsubs is the substring your are trying to find:\nmy_string=abc\nsubstring=ab\nif [ \"${my_string/$substring}\" = \"$my_string\" ] ; then\n  echo \"${substring} is not in ${my_string}\"\nelse\n  echo \"${substring} was found in ${my_string}\"\nfi\n\nThis works because ${VAR/subs} is equal to $VAR but with the first occurrence of the string subs removed, in particular if $VAR does not contains the word subs it won't be modified.\n\nA: Using bash filename patterns (aka \"glob\" patterns)\nsubstr=ab\n[[ abc == *\"$substr\"* ]] && echo yes || echo no    # yes\n[[ bcd == *\"$substr\"* ]] && echo yes || echo no    # no\n\n\nA: The following two approaches will work on any POSIX-compatible environment, not just in bash:\nsubstr=ab\nfor s in abc bcd; do\n    if case ${s} in *\"${substr}\"*) true;; *) false;; esac; then\n        printf %s\\\\n \"'${s}' contains '${substr}'\"\n    else\n        printf %s\\\\n \"'${s}' does not contain '${substr}'\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nsubstr=ab\nfor s in abc bcd; do\n    if printf %s\\\\n \"${s}\" | grep -qF \"${substr}\"; then\n        printf %s\\\\n \"'${s}' contains '${substr}'\"\n    else\n        printf %s\\\\n \"'${s}' does not contain '${substr}'\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nBoth of the above output:\n'abc' contains 'ab'\n'bcd' does not contain 'ab'\n\nThe former has the advantage of not spawning a separate grep process.\nNote that I use printf %s\\\\n \"${foo}\" instead of echo \"${foo}\" because echo might mangle ${foo} if it contains backslashes.\n", "Q: windows 8 + Ubuntu dual boot I installed Ubuntu 13.04 on Windows 8.\nYes I can access both of them, but the process is kind of long.\nIn BIOS, EFI is for Windows 8, legacy support is for Ubuntu.\nIf I choose EFI first, the startup just go straight to Win8 without offering me a choice.\nIf I choose legacy first, the starup will offer me a choice between win8 and ubuntu.\nBut I can only choose Ubuntu. If i choose win8, there will be a mistake(file missing under configuration).\nThat is to say, every time i wanna switch to another OS, I have to go into BIOS and change the priority settings. I heard something about secure boot might be the cause of this situation. But the thing is that there is not even an option called \"secure boot\" in my BIOS, which means i cannot disable it.\nAll I want is that an option menu appears everytime i turn on my computer so i can easily choose what OS I want for today.\nCan anyone help me plz?\nThank you very much!!\n\nA: choose legacy mode on bios and then try boot-repair.\n\nA: I've seen this on some new HP pc's.. Is yours a HP? FYI -- any new PC with the Win8 logo on it has Secure Boot.. It's in your BIOS, but every BIOS is different, so it could be hidden under a drop down sub-menu.. \nSo far, there is no 100% sure-fire way to dual boot with a Win8 machine. Mine is even more difficult because my partial SSD is setup as a FakeRaid 0, which Linux doesn't recognize.. \nI have resigned myself that until they come out with a fix for dummies, I'm using Ubuntu on my Win8 PC using VmWare. The VM doesn't have the best performance, and some drivers are wonky, but it's better than messing with the BIOS and booting from a flash drive every time. \nNow if you want to have JUST Ubuntu, then you should be able to do it the way you currently are doing it, but by installing it over top of Win 8. \n\nA: Try installing Boot Repair in a live CD/USB session. It can work miracles for a missing entry in grub.\n\nA: Install Ubuntu (as in the OS, not the install) onto your USB. You could do that by setting up a virtual machine and running the iso of Ubuntu on it. When installing it, you might see your USB in the list of drives.

Totem uses the \"Pango\" font description in order to specify the font to be used in the subtitles, and Pango doesn't include color as a parameter. The values you may change are \"[FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]\". Please check https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/class-pangofontdescription.html. Valid representations are: \"sans bold 12\", \"serif,monospace bold italic condensed 16\", or \"normal 10\".

You'll want to do your own logging if you want to control the owners and permissions. You can just direct the output/stderr of all of the commands to a log file if that is what you want.\n", "Q: converting epub files to PDF format I would like to know the ways in which epub files can be converted to pdf in ubuntu.

You can use it to convert virtually any file type to any other file type, as long as the source file doesn't have DRM (like Amazon, Adobe, etc.).  If it does have DRM, check out Apprentice Alf's blog for help stripping it out with Calibre plugins.  Don't use the DRM stripper to pirate books or otherwise violate your agreement with the vendor.  Use it so you can enjoy your books on any device in any format.\nCalibre is also an awesome e-book management program that can do virtually everything.  It can manage Kindles, Android phones/tablets, etc.  It can even email your books with one click to your Kindle's email address if you want.  You won't be disappointed :-)\nFrom a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install calibre\nOr search for it in Ubuntu Software Center\nTo actually convert the EPUB file you can use the following command: \nebook-convert file.epub file.pdf (For details, check this other answer)\nOr you can check the details for the conversion dialog using the Calibre GUI.\n\nA: epub to pdf converter\nBefore trying calibre, I actually converted my file using the above program, a command line epub to pdf converter that is actually good with some handy options.\nUsage:\n1) unzip the file into a convenient location, and change to the unzipped folder in terminal\n2) make the .sh file executable \n chmod +x ./epub2pdf.sh \n\n3) run the file\n ./epub2pdf.sh <path-to-epub-file>\n\nThe default output directory is home folder, but a lot of customization is available through a properties file where it can be changed.\nThough the program hasn't been updated for a while, it works really good and I thought it might be an option for people to try out for converting their epub to pdf.\n", "Q: Can you run Linux Mint in a virtual box on Linux Mint?

I have used Ubuntu a lot, mostly through dual boot with windows. I had recently purchased new laptop with Windows 8, on which I tried to install Ubuntu 12.04.2 amd64 through wubi like before but I could not. I searched many questions here and came to conclusion that wubi just won't install on system with UEFI, because it is not campatible with GPT. So I had to look for other ways.

IMHO, renaming the Windows boot loader by default, as Boot Repair does, is unjustified, because this can cause problems down the road. There is an option in Boot Repair to not make this change. The recommendation to use Boot Repair is common because there are a number of common problems with EFI-mode installation, caused both by buggy EFIs and by problems in the Ubuntu installer; however, IMHO, Boot Repair should be used only as a last resort.

Well if that's the case, then there would be no overclocking.  I think that you can disable of one or more of the cores in the CPU.  I know that it can be done in windows, so there has to be a way to do it in Linux.\nNow personally, I think that only advanced users attempt doing such things to the CPU, and the system for that matter.  Because any small mistake can render the system useless.  So any modifications of this sort, should be done with complete caution.\nBy default Intel processors, have some technologies built in that help in saving power, such as:\n\nIntel Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's\n  frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom\n  to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy\n  efficiency when you don’t. \nIdle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is\n  idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing\n  useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on,\n  where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher\n  C-states.\n\nAs mentioned above, be careful when dealing with such settings.\n\nDisabling a core in Linux can be done through the grub menu and add\n  parameters to the kernel entry. These parameters are sent directly to\n  the core when the Linux is starting. The Linux system has to be\n  restarted after the modifications to disable a core in a multi-core\n  CPU are made.\n\nFor the Procedure when using Linux see Multicore CPU: how to disable a core\n Source: Intel \n Source: Multicore CPU: how to disable a core \n\nA: You can't, no OS can do that and it's for a good reason, The CPU has internal registers and controllers to manipulate the frequency and the number of active cores.\nThis days all the CPUs have auto-scaling features, even low end ARM smartphones, they are able to scale on any OS, depending on what their architecture is and how they operate, it's also not correct to assume that your CPU is doing nothing or that there is a \"low\" CPU usage, your CPU is always doing something, it's a specific task or an IDLE loop but since the IDLE loop can be optimized by the manufacturer it can consume a really low amount of power compared to how many Watt are used to perform a specific task.\nNever ever manipulate any CPU or Bios related setting if you don't strictly need to ( I don't think that there could ever be a situation like this ) and if you don't really know all the bits and specs of your machine.\nKeep in mind that Ubuntu it's probably consuming more resource to keep your GUI alive than what it need to reproduce your video.\n\nA: Yes, you can and there is a gnome extension to do it called \"CPUFREQ\"\nInstalling is pretty self explanatory.  Find it here: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1082/cpufreq/\nVery useful to take cores offline on long flights without electricity.  You Can also clock down speed on the cores, etc. \n", "Q: sharing a 1 GB file that can be stream more then 10 computer i want to share a AVI file which capacity is 1 GB and my os is linux ubuntu 12.10 via a wireless Router by the name of TP-link .\ni want to share this file and at least 10 computer capable to play the file simultaneously \ncan every one  help me to share this file consider that i share it via samba and appache2 but i cant stream or play more then one or two computer \nthanks in advance\n\nA: You could use Network File System (NFS) to share a directory and place the file in it. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo\n\nA: A possible solution for your needs is a media streaming solution like this project.

However :\nI also found a solution that adding a script to ./.config/autostart-scripts/ will do the trick\n\nA: We had this problem on some hosted servers loading FW rules.\nOn these boxes they reboot VERY quickly and we found just putting a \"sleep 1\" in rc.local before the load statements seems to fix the issue.

Here's my custom workaround, which uses update-rc.d to make your commands run on startup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file myscript.sh in directory /etc/init.d with a heading: #!/bin/sh \n\n*Put your custom commands as the content\n\n*Make it executable: sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/myscript.sh\n\n*Create symlinks for your script for various runlevels: sudo update-rc.d myscript.sh defaults\nAlso, you could check /etc/network/if-up.d scripts and see if you could trigger your commands when networking starts.\n\nA: I once edited rc.local with Notepad in Windows and it began to have this problem.\nIn this case, using a text editor supports EOL Conversion, such as Notepad++, to convert the EOL style to 'Unix', may solve it.\nYou can also do it by :set ff=unix in Vim.\n\nA: Make sure the rc.local script is executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local\n\nThen, enable it: \nsudo systemctl enable rc-local.service\n\nReboot the system or start the script manually by running:\nsudo systemctl start  rc-local.service\n\nThe service status can be displayed by running:\n$ sudo systemctl status rc-local.service\n● rc-local.service - /etc/rc.local Compatibility\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/rc-local.service; static; vendor preset: enabled) \nDrop-In: /lib/systemd/system/rc-local.service.d\n           └─debian.conf\n   Active: active (running) since Mon 2018-04-02 10:39:44 -03; 1s ago\n  Process: 2044 ExecStart=/etc/rc.local start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\n Main PID: 2049 (svscanboot)\nTasks: 3\n Memory: 556.0K\nCPU: 10ms\nCGroup: /system.slice/rc-local.service\n\n\nA: I found in Ubuntu lxc containers that if rc.local has a perfectly correct shebang\ne.g.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nit fails, but if you remove the shebang it works.\nNot got to the bottom of why or what shell it uses I think it bombs on first non-zero too.

It depends on the quality of the cable, shielding, and other factors. I would personally use a cable that's no longer than 3m or about 10', to ensure that you get a high quality image out of your webcam.\n\nA: The USB standard offers both a really low voltage of 5V and a really low current range of 0.5-2.0A, so you are simply underpowering your device because with your long cable you are wasting power over the distance. There are limits to how long the cable can be depending also on the cable quality, but as a general rule of thumb you should keep things in the 1-1.5 meter range, or you could use some externally powered cable if available.\n", "Q: migrate git repositories I have an old laptop IBM Z61t as my git server.

Turns out, it's tor! \nI am not sure if I'm looking at a network problem or a bug here. Since the update to 4.2.0.11 my Skype can't connect any more. My room-mate has the same problem. We're both on Ubuntu Raring Ringtail 13.04 on an EliteBook 9470m in my case. Does anyone have the same problem, or do you know of a bug-report?\n(Update: Turns out it's neither a bug nor a network problem. Tor exit-nodes are blocked by Microsoft. See my answer below!)\nBoth purge-reinstall (including the removal of ~/.Skype) and using the .deb from skype.com (version 4.2.0.11_1) instead of the repositories did not help. Running Skype from the command line did not give additional messages. \nI don't know how to decode the log files in ~/.Skype/Logs but the usual logs in /var/log/ show no anomalies. Changing the port Skype uses to one that is forwarded to my machine by the router, did not work either. Nor did running Skype as root.\nThe fact that I can get it running on the same machine, when I use tethered connection of my mobile points towards a network problem, but then again other machines in our household have no problem at all and I didn't change any network configurations for half a year.\n\n\nA: The recent consensus is that Skype doesn't work well with tor and similar programs. That's what's causing the problems. Skype has automatically blocked a few massive amount of IPs running tor exit nodes. If you are experiencing the problem so far there are only two practical ways around it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable tor (both node and client usage!). After a day or two Skype should start working again. Should the problem persist enable logging:\nmkdir ~/.Skype/Logs\ncd ~/.Skype/\nmv shared.xml old_shared.xml\nsed 's/<Lib>/<Lib>\\n    <LogLevel>3</LogLevel>/g' old_shared.xml > shared.xml\n\nThen restart Skype, wait for the error to occur. After it post your logs in ~/.Skype/Logs in the appropriate thread of the Skype forum. They will help you! They will not react.\n\n*Configure a proxy for use with Skype:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Skype-Icon and select Options\n\n*Under Advanced, put your proxies details for Host, Port and optionally User and Password in the appropriate fields. If you don't know a good proxy already, you need to find a trustworthy list via google. I found hidemyass to be useful. Security is more important than speed!\n\n*Make sure ports are forwarded to your PC (for your proxy and incoming) connections).\n\n\n*Use a VPN connection (e.g. company or university network)\nUpdate:\nSkype support does not react to inquiries into this problem anymore. I find that very disturbing. There are multiple closed threads - all labeled offtopic. Either tor is unwanted because it gets in the way of data mining or tor users are indiscriminately blocked because of the spam emanating out of the network into Skype. Both explanations are ultimately evil.\n\nA: Did you try to fix the packages ? \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n\n\nA: Update: Turns out this answer is wrong. The problem here was Skype blocking IPs operating a Tor exit node. See answer below. \nHowever the answer might be helpful in solving other problems. \n\nHere is what I did.\nAll this was done using terminal.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. \nI removed the old Skype, using sudo apt-get autoremove --purge skype, and removed ~/.Skype folder.\nI then installed Skype 4.2.0.11 this way. \nwget -O skype-NoobsLab.deb http://download.skype.com/linux/skype-ubuntu-lucid_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i skype-NoobsLab.deb\nsudo apt-get -f install;rm skype-NoobsLab.deb\n\nAfter the installation was done, I typed Skype in Dash, clicked on it, and when it opened, I put in my user name and password, and was able to log in.

I have an external hard drive, NTFS of 2TB. It is meant to be only for movies and music. So, I have a Music folder that have several other folders and subfolders (Artist, disc1, disc2... in any possible combination that you can imagine... -im not an organized guy). Inside them there are music files, mainly mp3, but also .flac, .ogg and .cue files. \nFor some reason (I REALLY DON'T GET WHY) some files have restricted permissions on the writing, so I cannot edit the mp3-tag info using software like rhythmbox or even some things more specific like easytag. Whatever, the point is not the software, but the permission of the files. \nSince my idea is to edit the tag-metadata-info from rhythmbox and I just can't because the field is blocked -gray colored, I can't write on it, for example, to change the artist names-, I was wondering the ways to change the file permissions recursively. And we arrived to the point. \nI'm needing some help to make a script or a \"one liner\" to:\n1) identify the files and folders that have permissions different from 777.   \n2) a) on that cases, enter into each folder-subfolder, \nb) change the folder permissions to \"777\" -meaning FULL ACCESS, are mp3 guys, i don't care about security there- \nc) change every file permission on each subfolder to \"777\" full access. \nI have a LOT of music, so no way to do it manually. \nAny help, clue, or comment will be really appreacited, \nThanks in advance!!!\n\nA: That's because the NTFS filesystem doesn't support unix-style permissions natively.\nIn reality Ubuntu and other linux-based distributions are using FUSE to provide a virtual support for this kind of restricted access to the filesystem, in practice you should set this permissions when you mount the HDD, I don't know if there is a GUI or an app in Ubuntu to manage FUSE, but usually it's an fstab-only kind of thing.\nmore on the subject\n", "Q: Problems with vim-r Getting the following error when opening an .R file in vim (vim-r installed).\n\nError detected while processing /home/johnros/.vim/r-plugin/common_global.vim:\nline 3106: E484: Can't open file /tmp/vIuKjzl/0\nline 3327: E484: Can't open file /tmp/vIuKjzl/1\n\nI have also imported my .vim library and .vimrc from another PC where it works nicely, so I suspect it might have to do with my environment variables.\nRunning fish shell, but also tried on bash.\nAny ideas?\nUpdate:\nWhen ssh'ing to a remote PC, if I tmux before ssh'ing, the problem persists.

Try this and may be it will work for you\nsyndaemon -i 1 -K -d\n\n\nA: This command worked for me (1 is the number of seconds to wait after the last key is pressed before re-enabling the touchpad, change it to whatever value you desire):\nsyndaemon -i 1 -K -d\n\nJust add it to Startup Applications to make it work after reboot/shutdown.\nTo see more options type this command in a terminal:\nsyndaemon --help or man syndaemon\n\n\nA: Like others here the syndaemon utility solved my issue. For me the syndaemon was already running.\n\nAfter playing with it and reading some of the other answers here I determined that the cause is the -t option.\n\nThe option must have a bug because when it's specified I can still scroll and tap while typing. However, if you omit the option entirely then everything works fine; the entire touchpad is disabled as expected while typing when you don't include the -t option. I simply run the following to restart syndaemon without -t.\n\n$ killall syndaemon\n  $ syndaemon -i 1 -KRd\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-i allows you to specify how long syndaemon should wait after typing has stopped before re-enabling the touchpad. One second is what was already running and seems to be fine for me.\n\n*-K tells syndaemon to ignore modifier keys and modifier+key combos when monitoring keyboard input.\n\n*-R tells syndaemon to use the \"XRecord\" extension instead of polling for keyboard input. I imagine it uses this for performance reasons; the extension probably reports when typing activity stops instead of depending on syndaemon to continually poll the keyboard to see if there is input.\n\n*-d just tells syndaemon to run in the background when you start it, without blocking your terminal input. If you don't include this option then syndaemon will stop when you close your terminal.\n\n\nSo in the end it's the -t option that is the culprit here. Just get syndaemon running without it and all is well.\n\nPS - My machine is an original Lenovo Yoga 13 in case anyone was wondering.

I have been reading a lot about the Ubuntu Touch Core Apps initiative lately.

All Ubuntu SDK apps should be as usable on a desktop as they are on a phone or tablet.

This can be due to the actual permissions on the file or due to some filesystem mounting issues like nosetuid.\n\n*Some kernel security module is blocking sudo / setuid bit within the chroot. This is less likely, but there are some security modules that can disable the setuid bit within a chroot.\nIf you want to debug this issue in detail, I suggest you get acquainted with strace, it will show you all the system calls the sudo command does and it'll help you debug what file or permission is causing the exact problem.

I am running dualboot (Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04) and I would like to make more space for my Ubuntu partition. I am doing it from a live cd through gparted.\nI was about to resize my windows partition to get unallocated space and resized my ubuntu to fill it. But then i got this:\n\n\"Moving a partition might cause your operating system to fail to boot.\nYou have queued an operation to move the start sector of partition\n  /dev/sda3.  Failure to boot is most likely to occur if you move the\n  GNU/Linux partition containing /boot, or if you move the Windows\n  system partition C:. You can learn how to repair the boot\n  configuration in the GParted FAQ. http://gparted.org/faq.php\nMoving a partition might take a very long time to apply.\"\n\nI got scared and didn't dare to do it, but I still want more space on my ubuntu partition. What should I do ?\nThank you so much in advance\nMarkus\n\nA: It cannot be said enough, make a backup and confirm it actually has the required data in it before making a system change like this.\nThat said, I find that if I move the starting block location of the boot drive (eg from sector 63 to 2048) I have to reinstall grub before the system will boot. For info on how see the ubuntu page How to Repair, Restore, or Reinstall Grub 2 with a Ubuntu Live CD or USB.\n\nA: I slightly modified the position and size of my / partition using GParted from an Ubuntu 15.04 Live USB key. I had previously bit-for-bit copied it from a magnetic HDD to this SSD and wanted to align the partitions.\nAt the start I had Grub installed both on the disk itself and on another disk. After moving/resizing the partition I used the instructions linked to from the GParted FAQ that you referenced.\nFor partition /dev/sdc2 on my Grub 2-based Ubuntu machine with no LVM/RAID this was:\nsudo -i\nmkdir /tmp/mydir\nmount /dev/sda5 /tmp/mydir\nmount --bind /dev /tmp/mydir/dev\nmount --bind /proc /tmp/mydir/proc\nmount --bind /sys /tmp/mydir/sys\nchroot /tmp/mydir\ngrub-install /dev/sdc\nexit\nreboot\n\nBe sure to replace both the partition and disk with the correct ones for you, and check the actual linked instructions if you have a dissimilar setup.\nThis may not have been necesssary because the other disk I had Grub installed to was still able to boot the system.\n\nA: If you move the partition that contains /boot (usually where Ubuntu is installed), Grub will not be able to load and will go into a recovery line mode when booting up your computer.\nI myself haven't moved my Partition to give me more room because of that scary message.\nFor this next step, make sure you have a Ubuntu live CD/USB on you to boot from.\nMake sure to backup all your important files, then use your GParted live CD to move the partition you want to move.\nThen reboot your computer, boot into your Ubuntu live CD/USB, and with a Terminal, run sudo update-grub. If that doesn't run, try sudo apt-get install --reinstall grub && sudo grub-install. Then sudo update-grub.\nHopefully this works.\n\nA: Update for 2022.\nYes, it’s fine.\nI just did this exact operation on a partition containing an installation of Ubuntu 22.04, using the Ubuntu 22.04 Live image.\n\nA: It is highly recommended to backup any important files before doing resize/move operations. \nThe Gparted message merely warns you about the risk of losing data when resizing. It does not mean you will loose your data but its possible.\nI use Gparted and other partitioning software to change size of my partitions (Ubuntu, XP Vista, and 7 just as an example) almost on a daily basis, and never encountered any problem.\nIt is highly recommended to backup any important files before doing resize/move operations. \n\nA: Backup any important files.\nIn Windows run defrag and chkdsk / f.\nStart with a live-cd with gparted and reduce the partition.\nReboot with Windows. If everything works correctly.\nStart with a live-cd and using gparted increases Ubuntu partition.\nOpen a terminal, get the UUID of the partition, chroot, edit the / etc / fstab file, correct the UUID, reinstall Grub, running:\nsudo su\nfdisk -l\nblkid /dev/sdax \n#/dev/sdax = linux partition - mount as /\nmount /dev/sdax /mnt\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/dev \nmount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nchroot /mnt\nnano /etc/fstab\n#Change the UUID if this changed to /dev/sdax mount as /\n#Save the file (Control+O). Close Nano (Control+X)\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\ngrub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sda\numount /mnt\nreboot\n\n\nA: In addition to the above very detailed advice, most of it excellent, I will add the following:\n1) Aside from backing up all data which may be jeopardized, I create at least two redundant backups of boot, one by directly copying the entire partition to a new partition using a partition utility such as partition magic or gpart, both of which as I recall may have this feature in some versions.  I supplement that with a backup on a flashdrive or another computer. Be aware that there are hidden files which you may or may not have captured and unless you set your file manager to show hidden files you won't know. \n2)  What I personally always do when in this situation is to leave my boot partition untouched and resize/move only data partitions and root. That way, I don't need to worry about updating or reinstalling grub. I don't know that you have asserted any good reason to mess with /boot.\n3) Aside from the above instructions I would add that if you are lucky you might easily update grub if you can boot into Ubuntu recovery mode. You can get there via the second option, the boot Ubuntu advanced option. That will present you with an old fashioned menu with fdisk and other choices. Choose the grub option and if you are lucky it will automatically update itself for you. \nNote: If you don't know how to get into the grub menu, you will find on some Intel machines that you can find an option \"Boot from an EFI file\" in the boot manager. You should be able to wrestle yourself into the boot manager by experimenting with hitting Fkeys on bootup and surfing through the resulting menus.\n", "Q: adjust the brightness in 13.04 I have a dual graphics card: intel 4000 and nvidia 630m...\nI installed bumblebee and intel drivers from their website.

How can this be done??\nany help would be much appreciated..\nall servers except zen load balancer  are running ubuntu 12.04 lTS server OS\n\nA: Because each LAMP server is running its' own instance of MySQL, phpMyAdmin running on either server will only connect to the local MySQL instance on that machine. It's possible to set up MySQL to have server replication (master to slave) and for that you would have to delve into the MySQL manuals for setting that up. That would keep the databases synchronized and phpMyAdmin on either server would display the same database information (relative to the timing of the MySQL server replication process).\nThe other option is to use a single MySQL server to serve your databases and have regular backups set for the MySQL data.\n", "Q: Issues with Broadcom wireless 4313 - brcmsmac driver is very slow I have an ubuntu 12.04 LTS on Lenove Thinkpad Edge having Broadcom 4313 wireless. There are a lot of posts on getting 4313 wireless to work. For me, the only driver that works is brcmsmac.\nAfter booting I have to type the following commands to get the wireless to work\nsudo modprobe -r b43 wl brcmsmac\nsudo modprobe brcmsmac \n\nIf I enable b43, it is not detecting the wireless. wl keeps on trying to connect and is unable to connect. brcmsmac works in my computer. In many posts, I have seen that with 4313 chipset brcmsmac is the most dependable. I am ok with that.   \n1) At present the default driver loaded is wl. How can I change this to brcmsmac? I have blacklisted wl b43 etc in the blacklist... but somehow this is not working?\n2)brcmsmac although works, is very slow. How do I get this to work fine \nAny advice on how to proceed\nThanks again\n\nA: I suggest you remove the wl driver altogether:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nReboot and now tell us if brcmsmac is loaded:\nlsmod | grep brcm\n\nAnd tell us if it is working as expected.\n\nA: To answer your first question:\n1) Purge the bcmwl-kernel-source and broadcom-sta-dkms packages from the system with apt-get remove --purge.\nThis causes the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bcm43.conf to be deleted, which is the file that the wl driver in these packages use to prevent the brcmsmac driver, and other conflicting drivers, from loading.\n(As a sidenote, the bcmwl-kernel-source and broadcom-sta-dkms packages contain the same wl driver, just different versions.  broadcom-sta-dkms has version 5.1 of the wl driver, while bcmwl-kernel-source has version 6.0.)\nTo answer your second question:\n2) I have the same experience.  The brcmsmac driver is considerably slower transfer-speed wise, and transfer speeds are erratic compared to wl.\nPossibly related, the brcmsmac driver will also drop off the wireless network entirely quite often, with a \"illegal channel, tx suppressed\" message in syslog; a disconnect and subsequent reconnect via the Network Manager icon is required to make it work again.\n(One theory could be that the erratic and slow transfer speeds arise because the driver drops TCP ACKs for transmission, and the dropping off of a network occurs when the driver drops ALL packets that should have been transmitted.  I know more about TCP than WiFi though, an expert in wireless may have a different guess.)\nI don't have a solution to this one, other than using the proprietary 'wl' or the reverse-engineered 'b43' driver.  b43 may have problems with newer kernels, and the new version of wl shipped in bcmwl-kernel-source is also widely reported as being unstable, so the best option right now seems to be the version 5.1 wl driver shipped in the broadcom-sta-dkms package.\n", "Q: How to update Evolution Mail Client in xubuntu 12.04 I'm using xubuntu 12.04, and i need to upgrade Evolution Mail Client from 3.2.3 to the latest version.

Ubuntu is not intended to be a fully functional Windows emulator (nor is any other flavor of Linux), but rather it is a different system with its own programs, which can run some Windows applications quite well and others not at all.

I have read through the permissions tutorial on ubuntu.com and still have a few questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*i really dont understand the \"group\" part of the permission, what group, and how do i change the group as well as see what groups there are and what users have access to them.\n\n*is it bad practice to change the ownership of a secondary HDD to my user acccount instead of root. \n\n*is it bad to just set permissions for a drive to 777? i tried this and noticed terminal started highlighting it green in -ls\n\n*in general what are best practices for keeping computer secure but also allowing me to have permissions navigate and modify everything. \n\nA: *\n\n*Groups are intended to provide a broader level of ownership than just per user, to allow multiple users to collaborate and share files without necessarily allowing every user on the system to edit them.\nThe file /etc/group lists all groups on your system.\nThe chgrp command allows you to change which group owns a file.\n\n*I think this is OK. In theory, it means that if your user account is compromised, the secondary drive would be vulnerable (whereas if root owns it, the attacker would need to know your password to su to affect the drive), but in practice your personal data is already in trouble if this happens anyway. Personally I think of my external drive as an extension of my home directory, since I just use it as an extra place to store large files.\n\n*In general, yes, you should avoid using permissions of 777 for anything. If you own the files, 755 or 644 give you just as much access and flexibility with less risk that another user (if you share the machine) or a compromised service (say if your httpd gets hacked) will corrupt your data.\n\n*A good rule of thumb is to use the lowest level of access that you can for whatever you're doing. This is why Ubuntu doesn't allow the root user to log in by default and instead encourages a model where you log in as a less powerful user and only elevate privileges when it's truly necessary for system maintenance. It means that if you accidentally run something that you shouldn't, the damage is limited based on that user's access.\n", "Q: How do I install Pygame in virtualenv?

I want to bind a key such that a particular application (in my case Pidgin or Calculator) gets the focus, then when I am done and press key again, the focus returns to the previously focused application, as though I never changed focus.\nFor example:\nBefore:\n\nChromium —Alt+Tab→ Files —Alt+Tab→ Chromium\n\nUse of key binding:\n\nChromium —(bound key)→ Pidgin (answer to chat) or Calc (calculate something) —(bound key)→ Chromium\n\nAfter using above:\n\nChromium —Alt+Tab→ Files (not Pidgin) —Alt+Tab→ Chromium\n\nOther alternatives are welcome.\n\nA: Toggling between two applications can be done, as you know, with Alt+Tab. But it's designed go through all of the open windows by Z-order; so every time a third application is activated, the Z-order changes and it's usually annoying to get the two apps you're mainly interested back in sync for switching.\nI read your requirement to be that you have a main application Chromium and a secondary application, let's go with gnome-calculator, that you switch to frequently and would like a foolproof toggle between them using a single keybinding.\nYou can, however, create this behavior with a script and a custom keybinding. To create the script, I wanted something simple (for me) to understand and that could be easily modified without compiling; so I used python.\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport gtk\nimport re\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport wnck\n\n#windows are found through the titlebar, not the app name\n#edit the titles to change the apps\ntitlePrimaryApp = re.compile(\".*Chromium*\")\ntitleSecondaryApp = re.compile(\"Calculator\")\n\nscreen = wnck.screen_get_default()\n\n#needed for the code that gets the windows list to work\nwhile gtk.events_pending():\n  gtk.main_iteration()\n\nactive_window = screen.get_active_window()\nopen_windows = screen.get_windows()\n\n#if the primary app is already activated, find the secondary app, and activate it\nif titlePrimaryApp.match(active_window.get_name()):\n  for w in open_windows:\n    if titleSecondaryApp.match(w.get_name()):\n      w.activate(int(time.time()))\n\n#otherwise, activate the primary app\nelse:\n  for w in open_windows:\n    if titlePrimaryApp.match(w.get_name()):\n      w.activate(int(time.time()))\n\nTo use this script:\n\n*\n\n*Save it in a file such as myswitcher.py. A good place for it is /home/<user>/bin.\n\n\n*Make it executable: chmod +x myswitcher.py\n\n\n*You will need: sudo apt-get install python-wnck. This is the library that works with Gtk windows. It is not installed by default.\n\n\n*Link the script to a keybinding.\nThe easiest way to do this is to create a custom shortcut in System Settings >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts >> Custom Shortcuts.\n\n\n*After highlighting Custom Shortcuts in the list on the left, click the plus sign to add a shortcut.\n\n\n*In the popup window, choose a name for the shortcut and enter the command /path/to/myswitcher.py.\n\n\n*The new shortcut will be added to the list of shortcuts in the window. To the right of the name will be the word disabled. Set the keybinding by clicking the word disabled, then typing the key combination that you want.\n\n\n*Make sure you choose a keybinding that doesn't conflict with other programs. Those bindings are set at a lower level and will preempt the script. I chose Ctrl+ \\  (backslash) since it is not used by anything else and is more or less the mirror image of Alt+Tab (at least on my keyboard layout).\n\n\n*You need to log out and log back in before the custom keybinding will work.\nCredit for help with the script:\nI had most of the script logic worked out before looking around for examples (and there's no shortage of wnck examples out there); but I need to credit this answer on StackOverflow that solved some problems I was having with the regular expressions usage, the syntax for passing in the gtk timestamp, and most importantly providing the key lines about the Gtk events.

Any Idea how to fix this?\n\nA: You are perfectly right. There is no option in default Ubuntu sound settings to connect to more than one sink at a time.\nEnable multiple devices in Bluetooth settings\nTo enable pairing and connecting to more than one audio device the settings file /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf needs to be edited (as root). Add/edit the following lines:\n# Maximum number of connected HSP/HFP devices per adapter. Defaults to 1\nMaxConnected=2\n\n[A2DP]\nSBCSources=2\n\nCreate an output sink for more than one device\nUsing the pulseaudio command line we are able to create a combined sink of more than one sink where audio output then is sent to both.\nThese are the steps involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the internal names for the attached sinks by issueing the following command in a terminal:\npacmd list-sinks\n\nThis will give us a rather long list of all available output sinks. Look out for a line similar to this for your bluetooth headsets:\nname: <bluez_sink.xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx>\n\nThere are numbers instead of xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx as given above which correspond to the MAC of your headset. These numbers will be different for the both. Note down or copy paste the names of the Bluetooth sinks for creating the combined sink.\n\n*Load the pulseaudio module-combined-sink:\nIn a terminal issue the following commmand using the MAC numbers from above command (here exemplarily written as xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx, and yy_yy_yy_yy_yy_yy)\npacmd load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=combine sink_properties=device.description=myCombine slaves=bluez_sink.xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx,bluez_sink.yy_yy_yy_yy_yy_yy channels=2\n\n\n*Open Sound Settings from the Sound Indicator in the panel to find the newly created output sink we had given the name \"myCombine\":\n\n\n*Select this output device before you start your movie player and sound should be played on both devices.\n\n*Unfortunately this sink will be lost on log out. The steps above will therefore have to be repeated after every log-in or reboot.\nDisclaimer: we were unable to test here if this really works because we only have one Bluetooth device at hand. What we could test however is that audio outputs to both, the default audio, and the headset after we created a combined sink.\n", "Q: Could Unity 2D speed up 3D games on Ubuntu 13.04? I know that Ubuntu 12.04 allows for specifying Unity 2D or 3D at login.  Using Unity 2D when playing 3D games is supposed to make things work faster.  Does this also apply to Ubuntu 13.04?  If so, how can I get the Unity 2D desktop on my Raring Ringtail?\nI am using an AMD 6670 graphics card with 1GB RAM and Catalyst 13.4 proprietary driver.  I am running Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit.  \n\nA: Yes, running \"Unity 2D\" will make games faster. However, there is no longer Unity 2D. You can use other desktop environments. XFCE is pretty good. \n\nA: Using XFCE or LXDE should suffice, but judging by your specs, you probably wont be able to play very graphically intense games.\n\nA: In 13.04 there is no Unity2D. However gnome-session-fallback  is still supported. After installing we can select the desktop environment on log in:\n\nAfter we selected GNOME fallback (no effects) a GNOME classic desktop will be loaded without Unity, and without Compiz running. This will leave more resources available for games, and there will also be no interference of Unity key bindings when running full screen applications.\n", "Q: Is there a maximum number of groups? We started an Ubuntuserver for versioncontrol and would like to access our repositories via ssh.\nAs we need to give access to several external developers I thought it would be the best way to create a group per project and add the users to it which should use the repository. I cannot say how many projects will be created in the future, so I wonder if we could run into problems later.\nIs there a maximum number of existing groups or groups of which a user can be member of in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: Yes, there are limits. Linux now supports 65536 groups but you will need to use ACLs and RPCSEC_GSS and NFS version 4.0 or higher if you need more than 16 since AUTH_SYS historically has a limit of 16 groups. \nBesides the NFS<4.0 limit of 16:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Kernel >= 2.6.3: 65536\n\n*Linux Kernel < 2.6.3: 32\n\n\nA: The maximum number of groups is up to 232 starting with version 2.6.0 of the Linux kernel, like the maximum number of users.

In the Mac file browser (\"Finder\"), the USB drive doesn't even show up, as if there is no filesystem mounted.\nCan somebody confirm that this process wipes the drive clean before creating the disk image?  Is the previous filesystem permanently gone?\n\nA: You can try to recover the data with Testdisk.  Now keep in mind that its not guaranteed to recover anything, but give it a try.  \n\nTestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily\n  designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks\n  bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software,\n  certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting\n  a Partition Table).

If that's the case, then just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install kde-standard\n\nTo install the KDE Desktop Graphical Environment\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nTo install the XFCE Desktop Graphical Environment\nOnce you install the one you like, or both, go ahead and logout, and when you're ready to log back in, choose the environment the you want to try, and login, as shown in the images below.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Kinda sounds like the closest thing to what you want is VirtualBox. \nTo install it just search google for 'VirtualBox', it'll come up. \nAll you have to do is have the VirtualBox Virtual HDD ready and then the ISO of the OS you want to use.

I would like to zip up my homework from last year. How do I tar and zip the whole folder from command line Ubuntu (I don't have GUI).\n\nA: Read man tar. It offers:  \n     -a, --auto-compress\n       use archive suffix to determine the compression program\n     -j, --bzip2\n     --lzip\n     --lzma\n     --lzop\n     -z, --gzip, --gunzip --ungzip\n     -Z, --compress, --uncompress\n\nOr, if none of those is right for you, and you have a compression program that reads stdin, you could:\ntar cf- $HOME | my_compression_program >/tmp/compressed.output\n\nNote that I'm writing the output somewhere other than $HOME (backing up into a directory that you're backing up leads to unconstrained file growth).\nOr, you could read man 7z - it looks like you could do  \ndir=\"directory to save\"\n7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on /tmp/archive.7z $dir \n\n\nA: I would suggest that you use:\ntar cf - foldername | 7z a -si -m0=lzma2 -mx=3 foldername.tar.7z\n\nfor dramatic speedup increase.\nIt has the advantage of using lzma2 (-m0=lzma2) (which utilizes max available cores on your system and \"Fast compression\" preset (-mx=3), which is basically fast and good enough.\nNote that LZMA2 is not only utilizing all cores on compression, but also on decompression.\n\nA: Use the following one-liner:\ntar cf - <source folder> | 7z a -si <Destination archive>.tar.7z\n\n\nA: It is not a good idea compressing directly with 7z spcially on unix/linux  systems: 7z does not preserve permissions and or user/group info. So: first tar, and then compress.\nAs reported on 7zip wiki page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7z#Limitations :\n\nLimitations\nThe 7z format does not store filesystem permissions (such as UNIX\n  owner/group permissions or NTFS ACLs), and hence can be inappropriate\n  for backup/archival purposes. A workaround on UNIX-like systems for\n  this is to convert data to a tar bitstream before compressing with 7z.\n\n\nA: You should use tar -Jchf <Filename>.tar.xz <Files to compress>\nThe -J uses the XZ compression algorithm, the same as 7zip\n-c creates a new file\n-h preserves simlinks\n-f sets the filename\n", "Q: Extending Ubuntu Partition size with the unallocated space (swap is between these two) My Ubuntu 12.04 is set up on virtualbox, the host system is Windows 7. \nWhen setting up my system, I created 8GB VDI hard drive.

Both flash en HTML5 work good on other sites.\nThe solution is to re-enter the youtube HTML5 beta, and immediately leave it again.\n\nA: *\n\n*Youtube's HTML5 Player\nAn option would be viewing your YouTube videos using HTML5 instead of flash.\nYou just have to enter the Youtube HTML5 trial and enable HTML5 viewing, since Chromium offers almost full support of HTML5.\n\n*Fixing Adobe Flash\nHow do I fix flash issues?\n\n*'Aid' Flash at Chromium\nType chrome://plugins/ in the address bar you can disable/enable e.g. PPAPI or NPAPI Flash Players. \n\nA: The correct answer is here: https://askubuntu.com/a/316722/93826\nTo solve the issue you have to update the chromium ffmpeg codec to the extra version:\nsudo apt-get remove chromium-codecs-ffmpeg\nsudo apt-get install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\n\nA: Add &nohtml5=1 to the end of the url to force the page to using flash instead.\nAs a webdev who loves html5 and really dislikes flash I find it ironic that I'm suggesting this, but until Google fixes whatever is wrong with it's player, this is the only solution I could get to work.\n\nA: It happens to some people, me too (albeit on 12.04). I went to firefox and the same video plays. It seems that if you disable HTML5 on youtube then the video plays also in chromium.\n\nA: I experienced the same problem with Chromium on Ubuntu 12.04 64bit. Even changing to HTML5 didn't change anything, therefore I don't think it could be a flash issue.\nAfter playing with the settings I discovered, that changing the User Agent to \"Google Chrome on Windows\" solves the problem. All videos are loading again, maybe Google blocks some old Chrome/Chromium versions, as I haven't installed the latest version for sure.\nAnyhow, using the extension \"User Agent Switcher\" offers a simple solution here.\n", "Q: How to connect to Wireless Wifi with 13.04? Just installed Ubuntu 13.04 64bit, trying to connect to a wireless wifi receiver I have in my house. Not showing up in networks? Help please?\n\nA: Click on network icon (on top bar of Ubuntu ) than select network settings .\nNow you can choose wireless option from your network manager.\nAnd if there is problem in enabling your WiFi use following command.\n$ sudo rfkill unblock all\n\n", "Q: Delete files within my download folder I may have too many dang random files in my download folder because every time I try to get into it my explorer crashes after loading for a bit and I have to reboot my whole pc. I just wondered if there was a way to clear what was in the folder WITHOUT having to delete the whole folder itself. The main reason I don't want to delete the whole folder is because I don't know if that would cause some sort of error in Ubuntu so I figured I'd see if I could clear it first. Also I used ClamTk to check for viruses in that folder and found none.\n\nA: Deleting the Downloads directory shouldn't cause any errors. \nUse the following commands to remove and recreate it:\nrm -r /home/username/Downloads\nmkdir /home/username/Downloads\n\nReplace username as applicable, or you may use the shortcut ~ (tilde key, at the top left of your keyboard) to replace /home/username, like so:\nrm -r ~/Downloads\nmkdir ~/Downloads\n\nThe Ubuntu Community Help Wiki has a good overview of the terminal commands, if you're curious to learn more about them.\n", "Q: Opening program in Unity Dash opens about:blank tab in browser? I'm not sure what's causing it, but it's a right pain in the neck.\nEvery time I open a program from the dash, it doesn't matter what it is it opens a new tab in the browser. This shows the about:blank page.\nWhat's causing this and how can I stop it?\n\nA: Found solution to the bug.  The issue resides in online accounts needing authorization.  Another user posted online that once they logged in and authorized their Google Accounts, the problem stopped.\nI have decided to turn off google integration because despite authorizing access, google periodically makes you re-authorize access.  I hope this prevents the issue from comming back.\nNow I know how to fix.\n", "Q: Decimal point from number pad won't work on the calculator but will everywhere else When I'm using the calculator under accessories on the Linux system, I have a number pad to the side of my keyboard I use most frequently and the decimal point will not work from the number pad on the calculator unless I use the regular \"period\" key from the keyboard. \nAll other functions will work (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and the decimal point works in excel, word, etc. but not for the calculator. I know someone wanted to change the decimal to a comma, but is there any way to make the decimal work?\n\nA: To ensure the keypad works, make sure that the \"Num Lock\" or \"NumLk\" key is pressed.\n", "Q: vim cursor color change only applied upon movement In my .vimrc I have the following (based upon a tip on the vim Wikia):\nif &term =~ \"xterm\\\\|rxvt\"\n   \" use an red cursor in insert mode\n   let &t_SI = \"\\<Esc>]12;red\\x7\"\n   \" use an orange-ish cursor otherwise\n   let &t_EI = \"\\<Esc>]12;\\#FFA560\\x7\"\n   silent !echo -ne \"\\033]12;\\#FFA560\\007\"\n   \" reset cursor when vim exits\n   autocmd VimLeave * silent !echo -ne \"\\033]112\\007\"\nendif\n\nIt is supposed to change the cursor from orange to red when I enter insert mode and change it back when I leave.  However this only works if the way I enter insert mode moves the cursor, e.g. 'I' or 'a' but not 'i'.  Additionally, if I enter and leave insert mode without having done anything (or moved the cursor), hitting 'escape' will move the cursor back one space, which turns the cursor red, instead of keeping it as orange.\nIs there a way to fix this?  I'm using xfce4-terminal.  \n\nA: It works the same in gnome-terminal. If you wait a second it does change to the correct color, but I think that second or two are not controllable because the codes are inserted by vim based on events internally. I don't think that precise second can be fixed.\n", "Q: I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 from a DVD I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 from a DVD. (64-bit). I restarted after installation with the DVD in the drive but it went back to the installation menu and started reinstalling. I aborted it and started again. I removed the DVD before installing but now it is hung. Any help is appreciated\nphilip\n\nA: Try to install using boot-able  pen drive , it is the best option.\nTo make pen drive boot-able use the following command\n\nsudo dd if=\"loaction of ubuntu file\" of=/dev/sdb.\n\nWhen I install ubuntu using DVD it gives me problem most of the times.\n", "Q: Stream to Apple TV? I would like to be able to do AV streaming and (or) mirroring with my apple TV from Ubuntu. I'm running 13.04. Is this possible, or will I have to do the outrageously inconvenient task of using an $20 HDMI cable (</sarcasm>)?\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, AppleTV is pretty much a closed ecosystem. Content from any computers on the network is drawn from iTunes Libraries. There are some systems like the Synology NAS boxes that support hosting iTunes libraries, and could possibly act as a media server for an AppleTV, but I don't have a Synology box to test that out. Given that the Synology boxes are running a Linux-derived OS, there may be software out there that would allow Ubuntu/Linux to act as a media server for AppleTV but I have not found it yet.\n", "Q: What is special about the hicolor icon theme? As far as I can recall, whenever I install software using apt-get, I see Processing triggers for hicolor-icon-theme ... (sixth line from top) appear in my terminal window when the installtion is just about complete. An example is below:\nSelecting previously unselected package chromium-browser.\nUnpacking chromium-browser (from .../chromium-browser_25.0.1364.160-0ubuntu3_i386.deb) ...\nSelecting previously unselected package chromium-browser-l10n.\nUnpacking chromium-browser-l10n (from .../chromium-browser-l10n_25.0.1364.160-0ubuntu3_all.deb) ...\nProcessing triggers for man-db ...\nProcessing triggers for hicolor-icon-theme ...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nSetting up chromium-codecs-ffmpeg (25.0.1364.160-0ubuntu3) ...\nSetting up chromium-browser (25.0.1364.160-0ubuntu3) ...\nSetting up chromium-browser-l10n (25.0.1364.160-0ubuntu3) ...\n[08:00 AM] ~ $ \n\nHence my question. Is it because the hicolor icon theme is the \"ultimate\" fallback in case a theme of the user's choice is lacking some icons? In other words, is it because it is an essential \"inherit\" and complete in all respects?\n(I know that chromium-browser is currently a possible security risk because it is quite outdated but I want it just for local use as a web app with svg-editor.html.)\n\nA: Googgling around I found this:\n\nIn order to have a place for third party applications to install their icons there should always exist a theme called \"hicolor\"\n\n*\n\n*This name is chosen for backwards compatibility with the old KDE default theme.\n\nThe data for the hicolor theme is available for download at: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/icon-theme/. Implementations are required to look in the \"hicolor\" theme if an icon was not found in the current theme.\n\nMore at Icon Theme Specification (Gnome)/Directory Layout.\nAnd from the package description:\n\nSo, yeah it's the fallback icon theme.\n", "Q: How do I make Youtube videos stream faster on my ubuntu? According to this article, http://thetechblock.com/how-to-stop-isps-slow-youtube/, I can make Youtube videos stream faster on Linux, but I am not entirely sure how to carry out similar commands on the ubuntu terminal. If anyone could enlighten me on iptables commands, please do so and thank you.\n\nA: The commands would be\nsudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dest 173.194.55.0/24 -j DROP\nsudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dest 206.111.0.0/16 -j DROP\n\nUse at your own risk as it might stop other Youtube functions as they are Google infrastructure servers.\n\nA: This has also been suggested:\n\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -s 173.194.55.0/24 -j REJECT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -s 206.111.0.0/16 -j REJECT\n\nto undo these commands, use ACCEPT instead of REJECT.\n", "Q: unable to mount filesystem: not authorized I have two extra hard-drive.

So at the moment I have CWM on it, though that seems pretty useless if I can't get the phone into recovery mode.\n\nHow in the world can I get the phone to boot into recovery mode?\n\nA: For recovery, hold volume up and home then press power. To enable the Ubuntu Touch Preview to be installed, you need to format the /system partition before selecting to install ROM.

I used it for a couple of years in college so I thought I knew what I was doing. However, after burning the 13.04 64 bit ISO to a DVD on Windows 7, booting it and following the on screen installation instructions, I am now greeted with a blank screen that only says \"Missing operating system\" when I boot up my computer. I checked my boot order and my SSD that's supposed to have Ubuntu on it is first priority. I've tried reinstalling it a couple times, including one time when I went in manually, selected \"New partition table\" on my SSD, formatted the disk, and then created a swap and root partition, which I installed Ubuntu to. I'm still getting the \"Missing operating system\" message. I know the OS is on there because when I go into the installer it says that Ubuntu is installed. Am I missing something? I also have a second hard drive that just has videos and music on it formatted in NTFS, but I don't think this has anything to do with it because I made sure the installer only went to work on my SSD. Any help would be greatly appreciated, this is my main machine so I want to get it working as soon as possible. Thank you in advance.\nMy specs are as follows:\n- UEFI capable ASRock P67 Extreme4 motherboard\n- Intel Core i5 2500k Sandy Bridge processor\n- nVidia 580 GTX 3GB\n- G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 8GB DDR3 1600 RAM\n- Crucial M4 128GB SSD\n- 1TB Samsung HDD\n\nA: OK.

The Ubuntu 64-bit version (the amd64 ISO) is recommended for all computers that have more than 2GB of RAM because it runs faster than the 32-bit version. You should replace your 32-bit Ubuntu install with the 64-bit version.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.4 starts super-slow (90 seconds) on a 2x 2GHz / 4GB Ram laptop Ubuntu needs 90 seconds to start, Windows 7 only needs 45 seconds. Here is the generated bootchart: Click. I hope you can tell me where it wastes it's time. Laptop specifications:\n2x 2GHz, 4 GB Ram\n\nA: well, the chart is pretty self explanatory, as expected in any configuration the usual bottleneck is the HDD or any other I/O peripheral, especially on notebook machines, that chart is almost all pink and the pink part is almost always hitting the roof.\nYou probably have a slow 5400 rpm HDD with an really high seek time.\nYour CPU it's also a low end one but this doesn't really matter.\n\nA: This is \"fixed\" after reinstalling Ubuntu (I'm using Ubuntu 13.10 now). It might've been caused because my PC was upgraded all the way up from Ubuntu 10.4 to 13.4, and many many unneeded software polluted the start process.\n", "Q: belkin modem cum router setup on Ubuntu 12.10 with BSNL broadband I have bsnl broadband and I am using belkin f9j1001v1 belkin modem-router. The setup cd that comes with Belkin only supports Windows and Mac. How do I get drivers of it for Ubuntu so that I can setup the router and eventually configure it for WiFi accessibility?\nI tried accessing  and configure. The dhcp was detected but internet is never detected.\nplease help if anyone has encountered the same problem.\n\nA: Drivers are never needed for a Router. A router will always be accessed via a web page. You can determine the web page to go to by looking at your IP settings.\nSo if you execute the command ifconfig you get an output like \neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 90:2b:34:36:50:55  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.144  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::922b:34ff:fe36:5055/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:95235 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:68090 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:2\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:124193612 (124.1 MB)  TX bytes:6263115 (6.2 MB)\n\nThis tells me web address is very likely to be at http://192.168.1.1 which is the lowest address for your segment.\nAs to internet not working first connect without router to see it works, which it probably does. then plug the cable into the WAN port and your computer into the LAN port on the back\n\nA: Open a web browser and type in the IP address 192.168.2.1 of the modem-router written on the underside of it.You would  then  see the login page of modem-router.Click on submit.Then click on lan settings.Enable dhcp.Then click on apply changes.Then click on connection type,  click on PPoE,click on next.Type the username and password,select 'Yes'for IP assigned by ISP.Type 0 for vpi and 35 for vci.Select LLC for Encapsulation.Click on apply changes.Your internet connection has been set up.\n", "Q: Utorren't won't start with Wine Yesterday due to a problem i had,I reinstalled Ubuntu.Before the reinstall,starting Utorrent with Wine worked,but now it doesn't anymore,I click on the utorrent.exe and nothing happens,it's like I don't even click on it.What could be the problem?\n\nA: You may not have Wine set as a default.  You can right click on it and go to properties and Open With.  You also have to hit other applications and select the version of Wine that you want to use.\n\nA: My shortcut to open utorrent runs wine /home/<myuser>/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/uTorrent/utorrent_2.0.4.exe /NOINSTALL\nI forget where I found that out from, but if I remember correctly it didn't work without the /NOINSTALL switch.\nObviously you'll need to change which exe it runs as mine is utorrent version 2.0.4.\n\nA: Have you tried transmission bit-torrent client?\nsudo aptitude install transmission\n\n", "Q: Why am I getting compile time errors in this C++ program? I am new to Ubuntu and its terminal. I am trying to code C++ using nano something.cpp a general \"Hello World\" program at first.\nFirst I got some error about iostream.h and cout not recognised. I searched the web and found that it was a newer C++ and we had to use iostream instead of iostream.h and std::cout instead of cout. It worked well after making those changes (compiled using gcc).\nNow I tried creating the second program. Here I had to input my name and it would show \"Hello Myname\".\nThe code was:\n#include <string>\n#include <iostream>\nint main()\n{\n  string g;\n  std::cout << \"What is your name?\\n\";\n  std::cin >> g;\n  std::cout << \"Hello\\n\" << g << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n\nWhen I tried to compile (using gcc myprog.cpp -o hello); I got the following errors:\nprog.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:\nprog.cpp:5:1: error: ‘string’ was not declared in this scope\nprog.cpp:5:1: note: suggested alternative:\n/usr/include/c++/4.6/bits/stringfwd.h:65:33: note:   ‘std::string’\nprog.cpp:5:8: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘g’\nprog.cpp:7:13: error: ‘g’ was not declared in this scope\n\nI searched the web but did not find any help. How do I get rid of these errors?\nI would also be happy if somebody would suggest me a book on this \"NEWER\" C++.\n\nA: First of all use g++ to compile, second you forgot the namespace qualifier for the string g. Try std::string g;. And compile it with g++ myprog.cpp -o hello.\n", "Q: Networking commands doesn't work; what should I do? Commands I tried on Ubuntu Server 12.04:\n#sudo /etc/init.d/networking start\n\nRather than invoking init scripts through `/etc/init.d`, use the service(8)\nutility, e.g. service networking start\n\nSince the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\nUpstart job, you may also use the start(8) utility, e.g. start networking\nnetworking stop/waiting\n\n\n#service networking status\nnetworking stop/waiting\n\n#service networking start\nnetworking stop/waiting\n\n\nA: You can try to put the network up with a static IP by using ifconfig  when you are connecting directly to your server.

driver\n\nHow can I fix this? I know that the netbook has integrated graphic card. \n\nA: You may need to change your kernel to 32-bit generic (WITHOUT pae). See http://ef.gy/ubuntu-cedarview-drivers\n\nA: Try running the updates first (and reboot).\nI had the same problem, dark screen and error trying to install cedarview driver, but this happened only at first boot, then I ran the update and after reboot everything is fine.\nI still cannot install cedarview driver, but light is ok.\n\nA: This is a recognized bug: Bug #1132584\nThe solution is too simple:\n\nIf Cedarview owners (Intel Atom D2500/D2700/N2600/N2800) want to use\n  this module, they are encouraged to do a clean install of Ubuntu\n  12.04.1. Once 12.04.1 is installed, the users should not install newer lts-kernel or\n  lts-xserver packages, as they need to run kernel 3.2.x for the module\n  to work correctly.\n\nI hope this will be of your interest.\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS Installation Process Suddenly Stops I plan to install Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS alongside Windows 7 in Asus A43E Series and I had an unsuccessful experience about the installation. \nHere is the chronology:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed Ubuntu via USB Stick. While the 3 options appear, I select the 1st which is \"install inside Windows 7\", but the process suddenly stopped. The next instruction was to remove the installation media and press the \"enter\" button which I did, but Windows 7 appeared not Ubuntu.\n\n*Then I try another media, the DVD instead of the USB Stick and I had the same result.\nPlease help.\n\nA: Instead of using Wubi (Ubuntu INSIDE Windows), install Ubuntu the standard way (in its own partition). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\nYour disk may be GPT, and Wubi is not compatible with GPT.\n", "Q: KDE won't see the shortcuts/widgets from other partitions/hard disks I was using Ubuntu default until yesterday when I installed KDE to try it out and I kind of like it,it's very customizable,but there's one problem...\nI added 3 other desktops in order to set up 4 of them total,each with a different wallpaper and for different environments (fun,work/study,etc etc).On the second desktop I've set up a \"Folder View\" panel to a folder on another partition of the same hard disk on which Ubuntu is installed.\nThe thing is that when I restart the computer,the panel says that the folders don't exist at the location where it should be,but it actually exists there.If I go to the settings there and I select \"Specify Folder\" and re-select the folder,it re-appears,without me modifying the path or anything (it actually is already selected when I enter the settings,but I need to re-click on it to re-appear).\nThe same thing happens with my hard disk shortcuts on the first desktop page,if I click on them,I get an error saying that they don't exist,but they do.\nIf i select the file manager and click on the hard disk from there,it recognizes them without problem...and after I do that,the hard disk shortcuts are also recognized.\nIs there a way for me to solve this and not having to re-enter all hard disks and enter the setup of the \"folder view\" on the second desktop all the time?\n\nA: It sounds like the partition your files are on is not automatically mounted when your computer boots.  When you go to the settings and select \"Specify Folder\" and navigate to the folder, or when you open up the file manager and click on the drive, the computer mounts the partition, which gives you access to all of the files on it.\nTo fix it so you don't have to do this anymore, you should add the drive to your fstab file.  Here's a way to do it so you don't have to re-adjust your shortcuts and folder views:\nFind the UUID of the Partition\n\n*\n\n*Open up the file manager and click on the drive.  This will mount the partition.  We will use this to find some information about the drive.\n\n\n*Open a terminal and type the command mount.  This command will show you everything that is mounted on your computer.  Your partition will probably be the one on the bottom.  That line will look something like\n/dev/sda3 on /media/98cab7eb-ceb8-47f9-8a39-cccecbe4e134 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisk),\nexcept you will have different jibberish instead of the bold jibberish for my example, and it probably won't start with sda3.  That jibberish is the UUID of your drive.  We need to copy the UUID, so select it, right-click, and choose \"Copy\"\n\n\n*Go back to the file manager, and on the drive in the list of drives on the left, right-click and choose Unmount.\n\nNow back to the terminal!!\n\n\n*First, create the directory to be the mount point:\nsudo mkdir /media/98cab7eb-ceb8-47f9-8a39-cccecbe4e134\n\n\n*Backup /etc/fstab:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak\n\n\n\n*Next, open your /etc/fstab file:  Open /etc/fstab with an editor, such as nano.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n\n\n*Add the following line to the end of your /etc/fstab file\nUUID=98cab7eb-ceb8-47f9-8a39-cccecbe4e134  /media/98cab7eb-ceb8-47f9-8a39-cccecbe4e134  ext4  defaults  0  0\nthe spaces between entries should be tabs, and make sure the part that says ext4 matches what you got from the mount command earlier.\n\n\n*Reload fstab:\nsudo mount -a\n\nIf you get any errors at this point, go back and double-check the line in your /etc/fstab file.\n\n\n*Now your shortcuts and folder views should work.\n\nNote:\nThis is not exactly the \"correct\" to do this, but it will work without negative consequences.  The /media directory is normally used by your system for mounting devices dynamically.  The correct way to accomplish what you seek is to create the mount point directory as /mnt/98cab7eb-ceb8-47f9-8a39-cccecbe4e134 and adjust the fstab file.  But then you'd have to change all your shortcuts and folder views.\n", "Q: Is it normal when installing DE's, the boot up screen changes? (DE's = Desktop Environments.)\nI was looking for a lightweight DE,when i started thinking about Xubuntu.\nI installed it,and i had to reboot my Asus Eee laptop because of updates.\nWhen it booted up,there was a Xubuntu bootup screen.\nIs that normal? \n\nA: Yes if you installed the xubuntu-desktop, then it replaces the boot splash, but you can change the boot splash if you want to. \n", "Q: Installation of wifi drivers I use a toshiba satellite L755. how do I download and install wifi drivers. PLease I am new to ubuntu.

I don't care which one (or should I care? My NAS (Synology DS212) supports all).\nI've made somce screenshots available; they might help to understand what I did. At least I hope so… ☺\nIn the Déjà Dup settings, I entered the details as shown on the screenshot; it translates to the following custom location: ftp://a@172.17.2.3:21/home/Sicherung/DejaDup\nWhen I then try to start a backup, I just see a screen which says:\n\nBackup location not available\nWaiting for a network connection …\n\nWhat I'm missing is the prompt for the password. Is that the issue? The directory /home/Sicherung/DejaDup exists on my local FTP server 172.17.2.3 for my user a; see this screenshot of the FTP session on my pictures.\nThanks,\nAlexander\n\nA: In my experience, if your backup location requires a password, Deja Dup has no way to get the user to supply that password. If you need to connect securely, you could set up SSH key authentication if your NAS supports that. This walks through how to do that if you need that: How can I set up password-less SSH login?\nI back up via SSH in Deja-Dup. I've talked about how here: https://askubuntu.com/a/346005/103537 While those instructions are pretty particular to FreeNAS, something similar could work for your NAS.\nOtherwise, you could try setting up a location on your NAS that does not require a password.\n", "Q: Installed Nvidia driver from website and now Ubuntu won't even start up Installed Nvidia driver from website and now Ubuntu won't even start up. Just a black screen with a flashing cursor. I did a boot-repair but did nothing? Very frustrating. Any solutions or is it still a problem?\nThanks\n\nA: When you see the black screen did you try and type \"CTRL+ALT+F1\" to see if you can acces the terminal?\nIf you can, then you should remove the nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nNouveau can be blacklisted sometimes, so let's be sure it is not:\necho 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nLast , search for the xorg.conf file and remove it as well.\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n", "Q: Problem with HDMI on Ubuntu 12.04 I've a problem with HDMI on my ultrabook.\nOne week ago it worked fine but now there is a problem.\nWhen I connect it, Ubuntu recognize the monitor-tv but it's black/blank, no image will display.\nSomeone can help me?

You need to rewrite the master boot.   You need to start you machine from the Windows XP CD, and go to the Recovery Console. Once you get there, you will need to go to command prompt, and then type fdisk /mbr.\n", "Q: How to configure postfix to test site on LAMP virtualhost? i want to test e-mail functions of php forum script.\nI installed LAMP, postfix.\nHow to configure postfix to test e-mail from site on localhost?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install and access webmin http://www.webmin.com/\n\n*If it is a virtual machine change the network mode to NAT to access internet or make sure your LAMP machine has internet access \n\n*Install Dovecot service.

This avoids the decoding and encoding step for the specified stream, so it does only demuxing and muxing which is useful if you want to change the output container format or manipulate or add container-level metadata. Performing a stream copy is faster than re-encoding and will not cause any quality loss.\nNote that default behavior only chooses one stream type per input, so including -map 0 will include all streams for the first input. If you only have one stream type for the input, such as in the question above, then -map 0 is superfluous, but it does not hurt to leave it. See the documentation on stream selection and -map option for more info.\nExample:\n$ ffmpeg -i input.MTS -codec copy -map 0 output.mkv\n\nExample using a bash for loop if you want to encode all videos in a directory:\n$ mkdir outputdir\n$ for f in *.MTS; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -codec copy -map 0 outputdir/\"${f%.MTS}.mkv\"; done\n\n\nA: You can use some other converter apps to help you. The MKV format is very convenient for you to add subtitles into the video. But since it is a container format , then during the conversion, some problem may occur. find some other free converter apps to help you do your job. I personally think this ffMPEG is a little big diffictulty for me to trans-code my videos. And if there is some subtitles in it. Better you not using this ffMPEG.

This file is executed when you log in, so you should see the resolution change at that point.\nI can't guarantee this method though, because I don't know if your system has other startup scripts in the home folder.\nAs for rc.local, it should be executable by default.

And Software Center doesn't do the downloading. You cannot install packages to a separate directory, other than where the package indicates the files are to be put. The packages are installed the same way if you use Software Center, apt-get on the command line, or any other tool, such as synaptic.\nHowever, in the case of For Purchase apps (whether they are for a price, or free), the data is generally stored entirely in /opt, except for a few small files to make the app available to launch in the Unity dash, and similar. In this case, you can simply make an ext4 partition and mount it as /opt on boot by adding the appropriate configuration to a new file in /etc/fstab.d/. You can mount the partition elsewhere first, to copy any data which already exists in /opt over to the new partition.\nFor the case of games installed via Steam however, they are outside the realm of Ubuntu's package management, and always installed into the Steam application data and profile directories, which default to being a hidden folder within $HOME. It would be possible to mount a partition in this location, with all the Steam data, as well.\nIf you mean where the packages themselves are downloaded to, prior to installation, they are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives and you can mount a separate partition there, or simply clean out the directory occasionally to free space if necessary.\n", "Q: AMD Mobility Radeon FGLRX will not work I have a big issue here\nI have a AMD Mobility Radeon HD 4225/4250 and when  install the fglrx and   i reboot it wont show the whole unity desktop like no launcher and no upper bar,   \ni have ubuntu 13.04 and its like fresh and brand new and its fully up to date.\nplease assist me\n\nA: From what I know,the Radeon HD 4xxx series is no longer supporter by Ubuntu 13.04.\nI have HD 4350/4550 and after trying to do the same thing,Ubuntu got messed up,it recognized my display as a laptop and my resolution went from berserk,I couldn't see anything anymore except the middle of the screen...couldn't see the menus,the bars,anything.Had to reinstall in the end...so it might be something similar.\n", "Q: Privacy settings icon not visible in gnome 3.8 In my settings menu of ubuntu-gnome, gnome 3.8.2, I do not have a icon for privacy settings.

I've tried this several times in the past, but none of them worked. First I tried doing it like a normal Xubuntu 32 bit install (I removed the hard drive of the computer I was installing it from) using ubiquity, but it gave me some error. I Googled it and it was because it won't install if it is tagged \"removable media\". Then I tried doing a full install in virtualbox, with a virtual disk the size of my flash drive, then imaging it and transferring the img file over ssh, so I could use dd to write it to the drive. This didn't work, and resulted in a weird partition setup. It obviously didn't work because the main partition was 256MBs and a swap of 15.75 gb.\nIs there any easy way of doing this? Preferably with a ext2 file system to reduce writes, but that doesn't matter all that much.\n\nA: The normal Ubuntu install should work fine to a 4G stick (even though it claims to need more).\nSet up your install media, a 1-2G USB or DVD, then boot it and insert your target 16G stick. Select the 16G stick as the install target and it should work.\nI use ext2, no swap, and align the partitions to 4M (start at sector 8192).  I have heard people recommend ext4 without journaling but no experience with that.  I put /tmp and /var/log into ram for better performance (fstab entries), put noatime on the root file\nsystem to avoid writes just for accessing files, and link a few other directories to /tmp, like /var/cache/apt/archives.  Don't know the error you encountered.  One caution, the grub.cfg will be created with wrong devices, so it won't boot until you fix them (bug filed long ago).  The wrong device used to be one too high (because when the USB install media is removed, all disks move up one place (CDROM avoid that issue).  \n\nA: press the super key ( Windows key ) and search for startup disk creator.\n\nit gives you some basic options about how to partition your HDD while installing ubuntu on USB, especially if you want to create a separate partition to save your files or not.

There's nothing about that script that requires root permissions, apart from maybe writing to that log file, but you can just change ownership of that logfile instead.\nAs for the script, I'd modify it a bit:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor file in ~user/torrents/*.torrent; do\n    [[ -f \"$file\" ]] || continue\n    transmission-remote -a \"$file\" && mv \"$file\" \"$file.added\" || continue\n    printf '[%s] %s added to queue\\n' \"$(date)\" \"$file\"\n    sleep 1\ndone >> /var/log/torrentwatch.log\n\nLastly, you should avoid adding extensions for scripts, and especially not use .sh when the script is a bash script, not an sh script.\n\nA: When using crontab -e you can't specify a username. The format is:\nm h  dom mon dow   command\n\nSo you should put this in crontab -e:\n* * * * * /root/activate.sh\n\nYou don't have to use sh because the file has execute permission and a shebang line (#!/bin/bash).\n", "Q: Unable to change language I have just installed Ubuntu Gnome 13.04.

You do not simply open it to install.\nI would suggest reading about installing on the Ubuntu Wiki\n\nA: You need to burn the ISO to a CD/DVD, or you can create a bootable USB flash drive.  Depending on how old your system is, you may or may not be able to boot from USB.  Check you BIOS settings to determine if booting from USB is available.\nTo burn a CD/DVD using XP, you can use ImgBurn.  Its a free utility that allows you to create a bootable CD/DVD from the ISO.\n\nIf your system can boot from USB, then you can use UNetbootin to create a bootable USB flash drive.\n\nEither way you choose, once done, you need to set you BIOS to boot from either methods, to start the installation.\n\nA: You can download a program to put the installer on USB at www.pendrivelinux.com then just boot from usb and install.\n\nA: You need to use a disk burner or usb writer program, to write the OS to a storage medium, you then boot your computer from that storage medium to install. Try using pendrivelinux from http://www.pendrivelinux.com to write it to a usb, or nero burning rom from http://www.nero.com/eng/ to write it to a CD :)\n\nA: Using Wubi installer is always the best choice for testing and making sure everything goes fine before getting rid of your current OS as you will always be able undo the installation anytime and try something else leaving your working OS intact (Windows XP in your case).\nThen after making sure everything works fine and stable, you can wipe your entire HDD or whatever decision you take thereafter.\nFor more details on WUBI installer and detailed procedure have a look to the following link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\nNote: as you mentioned that your laptop is quite old, I would recommend doing a disk defragmentation to your hard drive before start doing anything ( you can find the how to in Improving Hard Disk Performance inside thepreviously mentioned link.\nAlso, you don't have to redownload the ISO file you got for Lubuntu.

But stuck in middle of the installation. As a result unity broke. Trying after an hour i have successfully re-installed unity(default version). \nAffects:\n1. Right context menu changes (theme)\n2. drop down-box change in top panel (theme)\n3. preview is not working in nautilus\n\nI re-installed ambiance theme and ubuntu-mono-dark icon set. Other theme effects are good.\n\nEDITED:\nHow to solve this?\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem when I apt-get install unity on top of a Ubuntu 12.04 Server installation. The problem was \"solved\" after I apt-get install ubuntu-desktop. So I think your system is missing some packages.\nFirst thing you should do is run sudo apt-get -f install to ensure there's no broken package and install ubuntu-desktop (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop). If the problem persists, install synaptic (sudo apt-get install synaptic) and proceed to the next paragraph.\nOpen synaptic and select \"Repositories\" in the \"Settings\" menu, then change to \"Other Software\" tab and remove any PPA you added to install Unity 7. Back to synaptic's main window press the \"Reload\" button (on the toolbar).\nStill on synaptic, press \"Custom Filters\" button (left bottom panel), then select \"Missing Recommends\" filter (left top panel). You should see a list of recommended packages that are not installed. Mark them all for installation and press the \"Apply\" button in toolbar.\nNow press \"Origin\" button and select \"Local\" filter. You'll may get a list of packages that don't belong to any repository. Review the list and (for every package you know you didn't manually installed from a .deb file) select it, open \"Package\" menu, select \"Force Version...\" and choose the highest version that is available from the precise (or precise-updates, or precise-security) repository (the repository name will be between parentheses).

It wasn't wiped clean before I got it, but I don't have the login details. I want to start fresh by loading up a new OS, Ubuntu. I saved a .iso file for Ubuntu (32 Bit) onto a USB Drive, stuck it in the server, hit F12 to get to the boot menu, and selected the removable device option. A black screen came up with a blinking line like in terminal/command line, but there was no text. The USB LED started blinking quickly and regularly, but after ten minutes of this, nothing had changed. I was expecting it to come up with a screen asking me about settings like language, but I think something is wrong. Any ideas on what the problem might be or how to fix it? Thanks!\n\nA: First of all, and on a personal experience but with IBM x345, its BIOS identifies the CD as removable device and it isn't capable of booting from USB until you do a BIOS update to the latest available (and wish that the latest BIOS supports USB boot) you can find it in this link http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-53061\n\n\n*\n\n*For USB, I would recommend the Universal USB Installer for making the bootable USB and use the Ubuntu Server x64 as well (most recommended as it will have better compatability to the server hardware, and you can install any GUI later as you wish)\n\n*If not possible, just try to burn the ISO file on a CD and use it instead of USB.\n\nA: You don't actually save the ISO on the flash drive, you actually have to create a bootable flash USB with the ISO.  You can use UNetbootin to create the bootable USB.  \nNow, I don't know for sure if the machine you have, can boot from USB.  If that's the case, then you can create a bootable CD from the ISO, and try installing that way.\nFor more information on installing Ubuntu, see Ubuntu Docs\n\nA: First of all, make sure that you haven't just copied the .iso to the USB drive. You actually have to write it using a special program. There is a tool for this in Ubuntu called \"Startup disk creator\".\nAfter ten minutes of the black screen with the cursor, does the light on the USB drive still flash? If so, this means that data is being read from the drive, and it needs to complete. If it stops flashing and nothing happens, then there's probably something wrong. On the other hand, it can take quite some time to load the files necessary for booting.\nI wouldn't be surprised if you're using a USB 1.1 port, in which case it could take an extremely long time to read data from the drive. In this case it should still work, even if you have to wait.\nIn either case, I would suggest burning the Ubuntu .iso to a CD/DVD and installing from that. This would be faster than a  USB 1.1 port (although still slower than USB 2.0), and might circumvent problems with USB boot that may either be caused by poor support in the server hardware, the USB drive, or possibly some kind of bug in the installer.\n", "Q: Boot to old kernel: GPU driver issues When booting 13.04 to the 3.5.0 kernel that came with 12.10, the NVidia drivers seem to be playing up. Screen resolution is not what it should be, and I can't set it to the correct resolution either. The \"NVidia X server settings\" tool gives the following error dialog:\n\nYou do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.  Please edit your X configuration file (just run nvidia-xconfig as root), and restart the X server.\n\nHowever, running nvidia-xconfig as root doesn't fix it. I tried both NVidia's 310 driver (which works on the default kernel) and the 304 driver (which used to work on 3.5, ubuntu 12.10), but no dice. GPU is an NVidia Quadro FX570M.\nThe reason I'm booting to the old kernel is that I'm encountering what appear to be processor scaling issues with the 3.8 (and 3.9) kernels, which I don't remember from the 3.5 kernel - which is why I want to try it out.\nEDIT: The Nouveau driver seems to be having troubles as well now, reverting to 640 x 480 resolution on both the 3.5 and 3.9 kernels. Something's seriously messed up, isn't it?\n\nA: You'd have to have the linux headers from your kernel installed. For 13.04 the linux-headers-3.5.0-... is not in the official repositories, so you'll have to get it elsewhere.\nWith any nvidia issues, it's best to purge all installed drivers and try to reinstall them.  sudo apt-get purge nvidia*and then sudo apt-get install nvidia-304 when you're running the kernel you want them to run on.\nIf this doesn't work, you'd have to purge them again and build the nvidia kernel module from source, when running this kernel. Notice that it's not installed with a package, so when you want to remove these modules again when you plan on updating the kernel, you'd have to run the nvidia specific removal tool.\n", "Q: Which motherboard manufacture(s) are the most Linux-friendly? I am looking to upgrade my motherboard to support DDR3, USB 3.0, and socket AM3+ CPUs.  I have used Gigabyte and ASRock motherboards without any serious issues.  I have been a fan of AMD for years now and try to stick with them.  Which motherboard manufacture(s) are the most Linux-friendly?\n\nA: I think any manufacturer that supplies Linux drivers are OK.  Personally, I would use Intel or Gigabyte.  If you want complete hardware compatibility with Ubuntu, then you may want to check out the Ubuntu Hardware Support page.\n\nA: ALWAYS do your research on the particular motherboard first. Some people say to use Gigabyte but they had an issue a few years back \nGigabyte, install windows to fix linux\nI personally had an issue installing ubuntu 12.04 server on a Gigabyte ga-990fxa-ud3 to which their tech support said to install windows to fix my ethernet problem. \nGoogle the motherboard you want and see if there are any issues. Even if a particular brand is said to be linux friendly, it doesn't matter because you are only getting one motherboard and it needs to work.\n\nA: That is a somwhat subjective question. I normally dont use Linux on my Desktop, but I don't imagine you having problems with any manufacturer, excluding for specific models. Seeing as Asus has a lot of Ubuntu-based netbooks, I'd say they are very Linux-friendly, but if you don't have any issues with both Gigabyte and ASRock, then they should also be ok. But the best way is to search beforehand and get some feedback before buying a new motherboard.\n\nA: I have been doing research on Linux based motherboards. Mostly on sites where people share their stories and problems with linux. The ASUS Z87 plus board is linux friendly.

Anything to be careful about?\n\nA: there is no \"damage\" of hidden recovery-partition possible (partition of M$) - yes, it is possible to delete the recovery-partition - but it can be re-awakened by simple bios-update before you reinstall then after bios-update with Windows 7 (only necessary when you want to give up Linux/Unix installation) - but warning here, dont do bios-update of UEFI-Bios ! - when anything is working fine with installed Linux already before. a bios-update is not ultimately necessary and has no effect to performance. so no need \"to fix somthing, where nothing is broken\".\n\nA: it depends what tricks the newer Uefi-Bios has now.\nYou have to adjust Uefi-Bios for Ubuntu-allowed installation to efi-mode\nresp. to legacy-mode.\nIt is explained here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nThe acer S3 is not an absolutely brandy-hot-new model, so you should have luck with this link.

I am using Ubuntu 13.04 x86_64.\nI wanted to own whole stuff in my home directory. So I executed these two commands.\nsudo chown -RcH rootkea ~  \nsudo chown -RcL rootkea ~\n\nNow due to those symbolic links linked to some other files in filesystem I have accidentally owned files which reside outside of my home directory.\nThe immediate consequences which I noticed are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo not working  \n$ sudo  \nsudo: effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root?\n\n\n*system has become so slow.

However, there is some variation from version to version of where files and folders are and what their ownership and permissions should be. Furthermore, with any solution besides reinstalling, you'll never know if there are some files or folders with wrong permissions, which may at some point in the future cause problems.\nYou can usually fix--or at least make progress--on the problem of sudo not working (i.e., problem 1, as you've listed it) by fixing its ownership:\npkexec chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo\n\nIn a situation like yours, that's mainly useful as a convenience measure to make it easier to perform whatever administrative tasks you need to get done before reinstalling. (Or before attempting to apply some more complicated solution.) A backup is definitely in order now, if your backups of important files (e.g., documents) are not completely up-to-date.\nFinally, please note that it's only ownership, and not permissions, that were modified. So you might try recursively changing directories' ownership back to root. However, that is not that likely to fix the problem either, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's unclear if you know exactly what directories have been changed.\n\n*some files should not be owned by root because they have to be accessed by less privileged parts of the system; setting their ownership or permissions too restrictively could break the system.\n\n*some files could cause security vulnerabilities if owned by root. A setuid executable always runs as the user who owns it. Your system may contain setuid executables that are intended always to run as some non-privileged user; making them run as root could be bad. Or someone may have--intentionally or unintentionally--created an setuid file (without having permissions to make it owned by root). If you make it owned by root, it will execute as root, no matter who runs it. That could be very bad.\n\n\nSo, if this is a production system, you should just reinstall.\n", "Q: HP dv6 7040tx overheating issue As the title says, my laptop is a  HP dv6 7040tx which has the following dual graphics cards:\n\n1.Intel 4000\n2.Nvidia 630M\n\nI went through some sites and found that both my graphics card are being used.

(Alt-Shift analog for ssh) I'm looking for a way to change the language I give as input to the remote machine in an ssh session. All I want is an analog of the Alt+Shift shortcut, but for the remote machine. Specifically, the language I want to use is Greek. I don't want permanent change, I just want to be able to change it repeatedly whenever I want. I've installed the locale packages for Greek (el-...) but it seems changing the language of the local keyboard does not help with the remote machine's language. E.g. I switch to Greek on the local computer, and I write - touch [greek characters' filename] in the command line, but then the file appears as ???, so there's something wrong.

It looks like the problem here is one of encoding or characters missing in the font; the file name, either when typed or when printed with ls or other commands, is displayed in an encoding/font which doesn't support the characters you've entered (hence the question marks). Check the encoding settings in PuTTY and verify that it's set to something compatible with Greek (UTF-8 should work).\n", "Q: Why am I getting these errors after running sudo apt-get -f install? sudarshan@sudarshan-DL-H61MXP:~$ sudo apt-get -f install\nReading package lists...

Hope that helps.\n\nA: I wanted to post this as a comment as it's general advice, not a final solution, but it got slightly too long. I can of course help you to find your concrete solution in the comments.\nTo start off with the general rule: There is no single best solution. It mostly comes down to what you're comfortable to design the document with.\nIf you know LaTeX, that's an obvious possibility. LaTeX documents are beautiful, pretty much by definition.\nIf you don't know LaTeX and are comfortable with a few options less, but know org-mode, that's another nice way to go. org-mode documents can be converted to LaTeX which can the be converted to PDF, and they look really nice, too. pandoc might be able to do this directly but I didn't check that.\nOf course, another possibility is to design your document in org-mode, let Emacs build the LaTeX code from it, and then use that LaTeX document to fill in the variables in every instance before you compile it to PDF. This way, you still don't have to design the document in LaTeX and don't have to build from org-mode documents but from LaTeX documents.\nIf you're okay with even less and don't want to do much, you can use markdown. Markdown offers by far the fewest options, both in design options and in content types. However, it is very easy to learn and use and you can design your document right here on StackExchange with a live preview. This should also give you an idea of its limits. There are nice documents in markdown but it usually involves a lot of tweaking it to the desired output format (in your case probably a multi-page DIN A4 PDF) which kind of defeats the purpose of it being easy to learn. Of course it can be a perfectly good solution for people who want to write a lot of – for example – documentation in markdown as it's super easy to write down, but in your case, the writing part is automated, so that advantage doesn't really count and the easy of using the language might not be worth the hassle of getting the documents to look like you want them to look.\nIf you're not comfortable with any of the above, you can use Jos' approach of designing your document in LibreOffice, unpacking it, changing its content.xml, packing it again, and then converting it to PDF. However, while this gives you a lot more options than markdown, it gives you a lot fewer options than LaTeX and getting up to the level of org-mode will be cumbersome. Actually, the whole thing seems to be hard to adapt quickly because it involves many steps when you want to change your document. It also seems to be the most error-prone. Not necessarily in the \"a PDF coming to be, in the end\" kind of way, but in the \"it looks like it's supposed to\" kind of way.\nOne important note, though: Don't try to switch out LibreOffice for Microsoft Office. While you may be able to find tools to convert those to PDF, it seems like a very bad idea to use their formats. The reason is that LibreOffice uses the OpenDocument Standard which uses standard zip files, therefore you can use any zip tool to extract and pack the file. Microsoft Office files, on the other hand, are merely based on zip. You will be able to extract them with normal zip tools but you won't be able to pack them using standard zip tools.\norg-mode or LaTeX are particularly useful if you want a table of contents. It's possibly with the others, too, but more work. If you want a ton of options and are willing to learn if necessary, LaTeX definitely is the way to go.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit hangs after boot I recently installed a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit version on my PC,\nFirst I tried to install it from CD , but it hanged after minutes , then i tried it from a USB thumb drive the same problem ,\nthen I installed it using WUBI from windows 8 32-bit Pro it installed normally but whenever I boot , It hangs after two minutes, everything stops working but the mouse and the keyboard are working normally.\nMy PC specs are:\n\nMB : GigaByte G41\nCPU : IntelTM Core 2 Duo\nHDD : 320 GB WD\nGPU : Nvidia GT 630\n\n\nA: I found out what was the problem.\nThe generic drivers for the GPU was the problem , I had to download the correct driver from Nvidia, then install it using\n$ sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-319.23.run\nAnd install it with the GUI provided.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Tablets: Installing Software without the Store?

I don't think that rm -r /usr/local/cuda is the right way..\nsome advice\n\nA: According to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cuda (my formatting):\n\"If you want to totally remove Cuda, juste delete the /opt/cuda and ~/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK folders:\nrm -r ~/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK\nsudo rm -r /opt/cuda\n\nand remove the export PATH=$PATH:/opt/cuda/bin and export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/cuda/lib:/opt/cuda/lib64 lines of the ~/.bash_profile file.\n\nA: I just ran the installer and at the end it says\nTo uninstall CUDA, remove the CUDA files in /usr/local/cuda-5.0\n\nSo you should be fine simply removing it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to close vlc to system tray?

To hide vlc simply click on the vlc systray icon.\n\nA: I think, you need for background music play and you anyways get the controls on-screen while playing video. The latest version VLC Media Player does not have the option of 'Systray popup when minimized' and in my case, the systray icon is also not shown. So, I came up with another idea of using something which Linux provides by default.

You can try to run make install in the new source, if there is no major change it should work.\nWhen you install from the original sources its a good idea to use checkinstall which can be installed using:\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\nThen replace your make install commands with sudo checkinstall follow the instructions and it will create a .deb package for you.\nThis makes upgrading easy - Just create a new .deb package and install it each time.\nYou can start using checkinstall on you already installed project, and it will start monitoring the files installed on you system from now.\n", "Q: Need to change the text in a lot of files at once I have migrated over web and DB files from one server to another and need to change the text in a lot of PHP files from the IP of the old server to 'localhost' where the databases can now be found.\nWhat is the easiest way of making the change in all the files at the same time?  The alternative is manually editing 8 A4 pages of file names. :-(\n\nA: The easiest way would be to use sed, for example:\nsed -i 's/192.168.0.1/localhost/g' *.php will take all of the PHP files in your current folder, and replace (globally) the IP address \"192.168.0.1\" with \"localhost\".\nEdit: This might not be helpful, come to think of it - I'm not overly familiar with PHP, so am not sure if the data within is stored in plaintext.

On the Xfce 12.10 desktop drag&drop to move files into a folder would copy them instead of moving (cut/paste) them.\nI tend to have many files on the desktop and usually I grab them and put them in a folder for further use etc. I want to be able to do this by drag&drop, but at the present drag&drop makes a duplicate of them in that folder without removing them from their previous location.\nIn Xfce I use the default Thunar, and it handles the desktop.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe question is limited to an older version of Thunar. In thunar 1.6.3, Xubuntu 14.04. drag&drop moves by default instead of just copy.\n\nA: I hope that this is what you want.\nWell in Thunar , highlight all the files that you want to move, drag them with the right mouse button, and that will give you a pop up menu, that gives you the option to Move\n\nAlso you can use the Shift, while dragging the files, and that will also move them.\n", "Q: \"btrfs filesystem show\" gives me \"failed to read\" errors My /home is a raid1 btrfs partition spanning two disk.

Since I previously did not find the somewhat obvious answer on the Internet I though I would add my question anyway and answer it myself. For posterity.\nThe command need to be run as su:\nsudo btrfs filesystem show\n\n", "Q: Set myself as owner of /etc with chown command now getting all kinds of errors I needed to edit a .config file (which I know for a fact is not creating these problems, just to clear that up) and it wouldn't let me save it, so I took ownership of /etc and all contents with the command chown -hR username /etc and that let me edit the .config file but now whenever I try to install any packages or use any sudo commands, it doesn't work  (I've checked for errors in the sudo file in sudoers.d and there was nothing wrong with that). \nSo how do I return it to the previous owner?\n\nA: Boot into recovery and issue the following commands:\nmount -o remount,rw -n /\nchown -R root: /etc\n\n\nA: Since some of the files in /etc might not be owned by root, if you want to avoid reinstalling, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a live system and mount the partition containing the /etc directory. For example, if your / partition is /dev/sda1, you would do this from the live system:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n\n*Set the ownership of all files to root:\nsudo chown -R root /mnt/etc\n\n\n*At this point all files belong to root. This is probably what you need but some files in /etc/ might have different ownership. If those files are also not owned by root in the live system, you can use them as a reference to change the permissions on the installed system:\nshopt -s globstar\nliveSystem=\"/etc\"\ncd /mnt/etc\nfor file in **/*; do \n    [ -e \"$liveSystem/$file\" ] &&\n        echo sudo chown --reference \"$liveSystem/$file\" \"$file\"\ndone\n\nIf you have also changed the permissions, do this instead:\nshopt -s globstar\nliveSystem=\"/etc\"\ncd /mnt/etc\nfor file in **/*; do \n    [ -e \"$liveSystem/$file\" ] &&\n        echo sudo chown --reference \"$liveSystem/$file\" \"$file\" &&\n        echo sudo chmod --reference \"$liveSystem/$file\" \"$file\"\ndone\n\nThat will just print what command would be run. Once you've seen what that does and are satisfied that it is correct, remove the echo to make it actually run the commands. \nNow that will iterate over all files, including those whose ownership is root in both directories, but that doesn't matter. You could write a more sophisticated approach but it's not worth it since this will take seconds. \n\n*Reboot your machine: everything should be back to normal.\nIMPORTANT: this will not help if you have installed something that isn't on the live system and whose files in /etc don't belong to root. If this is the case, you'll either need to find what you installed and reinstall it or you might need to reinstall the system. \n", "Q: can't play videos in totem - error says that we're missing plugins that should not be missing Relevant: During install I already clicked the box to allow restricted content.

Make sure that the program is correctly installed\". \n\nA: VLC\nThis would allow you to watch videos and listen to music but doesn't fix a very serious problem with totem & gstreamer:\nrm -r ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0\n\nThis is overkill, actually intended to remove ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/registry.[cpu_arch].bin\nBut it's harmless. It just removes cache files that will be regenerated as soon as you use gstreamer again (in totem or whatever). The idea is that your cache may somehow be corrupt and pointing to the plugins in the wrong place. There are no theories as to how this can happen or why this fix works, but it works for some people.\nNot for me :)\n\nA: rm -r ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0\n\nThis is the fix.

I had a problem wherein I couldn't get past the login screen in Ubuntu 12.04. Even though I gave the correct username and password, it still came back to the login screen.

Why does changing the ownership of the file fix my problem of being unable to log in?\n\nA: The .Xauthority (not .xAuthority) file can be found in each user home directory and is used to store credentials in cookies used by xauth for authentication of X sessions.  Once an X session is started, the cookie is used to authenticate connections to that specific display. You can find more info on X authentication and X authority in the xauth man pages (type man xauth in a terminal). \nSo, if you are not the owner of this file you can't login since you can't store your credentials there.\nThis situation usually arises when you execute a GUI application (for instance nautilus) with root permissions by typing sudo nautilus. You can avoid it (for 12.10 and older versions) by invoking the app with gksudo nautilus, or in any version using sudo -H nautilus.\n", "Q: Uninstall IntelliJ Ultimate edition version 12 My evaluation licence has recently expired for IntelliJ Community edition version 12.

Best is use a flash drive and make it bootable using Universal USB Installer.\n\nA: Try to boot your windows CD at startup to be sure it is no issue with your drive or the bios settings.\nThe next step could be to check the integrity of your .iso file you used to burn the CD, the best way is to compare the md5sum of your .iso and the file should have.

The shell performs variable expansion before ssh received the command. Thus, the actual command as received by ssh becomes:\nvar=$value; echo \n\nIn order to avoid the shell eating your dollar, use single quotes:\nssh host 'var=value; echo $var'\n\nConsidering your command, it looks like you are trying to use the output of one command in the last one. For that to succeed, you must make proper use of command substitution:\n\nssh host 'output=$(sudo virsh list --all | awk \"/running/{print \\$2}\" | tail -2); sudo virsh dominfo $output'\n\nOr even:\n\nssh host 'sudo virsh dominfo $(sudo virsh list --all | awk \"/running/{print \\$2}\" | tail -2)'\n\nThis assumes that sudo is configured not to ask for a password, otherwise you will get an error such as:\nsudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified\n\n", "Q: How to save config change on chntpw and quit Terminal?

There is nothing you can do about it in this version.\nThe solution is to use the chntpw version 0.99.5-0+nmu1, that can be download here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chntpw/0.99.5-0+nmu1/+build/634460\nIt worked just fine for me, no more password on Windows 8! =D\n=)\n\nA: what method are you using to clear the password? the best way would be to follow my guide.\ngoto shell\nCd media/sda?/Windows/System32/\ntype \"find cmd.exe\" press enter\ntype \"find osk.exe\" press enter\ntype \"cp cmd.exe osk.exe\" press enter\nreboot\nin windows click the bottom left icon then on screen keyboard then the cmd windows pops up.\ntype net user\ntype net user reboot.pro *\nput password in or leave blank\nlogin\nremember to change your drive path to the drive you want to use\nhope this helped\n", "Q: Why can't I create users?

For that, I need to find out where is the following setting stored:\n\nCreating the toggle script and panel indicator won't be a problem afterwards.\n\nA: The values you need are stored in xfce4-settings-editor. The function you require is lid-action-on-ac. So, to use xfconf-query to set it to do nothing, you would run\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/lid-action-on-ac -t int -s 0\n\nThen to set it to suspend, substitute the 0 for a 1:\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/lid-action-on-ac -t int -s 1\n\nThe values usable with xfconf-query that correspond to the settings in the graphical application are:\nlid-action-on-ac\n\n0=nothing\n1=suspend\n2=hibernate\n3=lock screen\n\nThis information was found by setting the values in the graphical settings dialog and then noting the value that appeared in xfce4-settings-editor under the appropriate function. You could do this for the other functions such as power-button-action, if you are interested in those as well.\nHowever, you cannot use the toggle option (-T) here explicitly, as that only works with boolean values (true, false) and not integers. You could however just use the two xfconf-query commands above in a script and fashion a toggle within that script, as you said you wish to do. \n", "Q: Is there a way to use Xfce integration features with unity?

It wanted me to do a reboot, so I did. And that's where everything went wrong.\nI booted my computer back up, it went to a black screen and said a bunch of crap, which kindof confused me, but it eventually started like normal. I went to google chrome and typed youtube.com so I could test if the audio drivers fixed my problem, and google chrome replied with a very welcoming \"This Webpage Is Not Available\"! So, I found network settings, and found that I had no connections in my network settings. I came to this computer, my family's computer, and looked up my problem. The first thing I found was a solution that said to go delete some things from /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules then reboot, and it said that the file would detect my ethernet and automatically put back what is supposed to be there. Sadly, instead of doing that, it simply left that blank, so i'm sure I messed up even more by doing that. Then, on another solution, it said to go to .etc/init.d/apache2/httpd.conf and add Servername localhost to it. That didn't work either. Now i'm here.\nIt's running 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Instead of RequiredAuthentications it's AuthenticationMethods. The parameters for that are the same.\nAs there is no deb package in Ubuntu for version 6.2 you have to compile it yourself but with auto-apt it's really easy.\n\nA: Just drop password login support and only allow login with keys.\nYour users can protect the keys with a pass phrase when createing them and that would be as secure.\nAs it looks as the option you want isn't there for the version of ssh packed, you need to compile the software and manage the security of ssh yourself or wait until the right version are packed.

In short, the VCD uses less error correction than a usual data CD and relies on the fault tolerance of the used Video Codec, so it's rather probable that the files get errors during burning and can't be copied from the VCD afterwards, but playback works without problems if the disc is accessed appropriately. For more details about video cds, read the Wikipedia article and the mplayer manual chapter.\nI'd recommend that you, instead of mounting the disc and accesssing the files via the file system, directly start playback of the vcd using a player that is capable of handling video cds like mplayer or VLC. To do this in VLC, either run vlc vcd:// or open the VLC GUI, go to the \"Media\" menu, click \"Open Disc\".\n\nIn the following dialogue, select SVCD/VCD and input your drives /dev node (/dev/sr0 if I see correctly in your question).\n\n", "Q: \"It has to install from unauthenticated sources\" from software updater I tried updating my 13.04 from software updater.

I've tried the modprobe, the echo to usbserial, and wvdial (which didn't detect any modem).\nCould anyone please give me ideas on what I could try next ?\nHere's the relevant lines from usb-devices -\nT:  Bus=02 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=03 Cnt=01 Dev#=  6 Spd=480 MxCh= 0\n   D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=00(>ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1\n   P:  Vendor=20a6 ProdID=f00e Rev=00.00\n   S:  Manufacturer=Modem\n   S:  Product=Modem Device\n   S:  SerialNumber=000000000002\n   C:  #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=e0 MxPwr=500mA\n   I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=08(stor.) Sub=06 Prot=50 Driver=usb-storage\nAs you can see, it's detecting it as a modem, but perhaps using the usb-storage driver.\n\nA: I found a procedure on some Internet forums. It has worked for me with the new Ubuntu 13.10 saucy.\nAt terminal execute the following\nsudo eject sr1\nsudo modprobe usbserial vendor=0x20a6 product=0x1106\n\nThis will detach the usb_storage device at sr1(cdrom) and enable the usb serial ports for the modem. By some reason this will only work once. If you remove the dongle and connect again the first line will not work.\nAlso it takes about a minute to the NetworkManager detect the new modem device.\nAfter the detection a new network option like 3g broadband will show up in the connections menu. Enabling it will allow you to create a new connection to your provider.\n", "Q: How to open the command line in Chrubuntu? I would like just in case I need to make Chrome the default again, to open a terminal window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is the terminal applications located in Chrubuntu?\n\n*Is there any key-shortcut that allows me to directly prompt for terminal?\n\n\nA: Have you tried ctrl-alt-t?

Removing it and rebooting has solved the issue.\n", "Q: Launcher in 13.04 does not always show when mouse touches the edge of the screen I have a weird problem with the launcher ever since I upgraded from 12.04 to 13.04. \nI've set the launcher to auto-hide mode and whenever the pointer touched the left edge of the screen the launcher would pop out as expected. After upgrading to 13.04 the launcher sometimes fails to respond. I've tweaked some parameters like sensitivity, acceleration etc through CompizConfig but they don't seem to change anything. \nWhat is troubling me is that this behavior seems to be completely random. Sometimes it happens when there is a window attached to the side, sometimes not. Even when it fails to appear the first time, if I try again and again, it will eventually appear. Touching the top left corner of the screen with the mouse always shows the launcher. Also, to make things even more random, it seems to me that the launcher usually fails to appear when i'm using my bluetooth mouse. When this happens, I try my laptop's trackpad, which doesn't seem to help, but the red dot (I'm on an IBM Thinkpad) almost always works. \nIf anyone has any idea at all, please share. It's not a huge problem, but its randomness and lack of apparent explanation drives me mad. Thanks so much!\n\nA: I think i figured out what was going on. One of the settings in ConfigCompiz was Duration of Sticky Edge Release After Break, which didn't sound relevant at first, so I hadn't tweaked it. It was originally set to 1000, I set it to 0, which I think solved the problem.\n", "Q: How can I copy files that are not bigger than 200MB using the terminal? The question says it all. I want to copy files in the terminal, but there are a few big files I don't want to copy (because they are backups). Is there a command to do that?\nSomething like cp --max-size=200MB?\nI know rsync has such an option. Is that the way to go?\n\nA: Try using the find command to build a list of files under 200MB and copy them to a dir. \nfind . -size -200M -exec cp -r {} dir/ \\;\n\n\nA: Here is how I do it with rsync:\nrsync --max-size=200MB --progress --verbose --recursive --links --perms  --ignore-existing --executability --owner --group --times SOURCE TARGET\n\nI would still like to accept an cp solution, though.\n\nA: This\nfind . -size -200M -exec cp -r {} dir/ \\;\n\ndidn´t work for me, because it copies all files when it finds a folder, because of the \"r\" flag on cp. I had to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Get the list of the files when their size is -200MB\n find /yourdirectory -type f -size -200M > list.txt\n\n\n\n*Then, copy the files from the list.txt.\n cp --parents  $(cat list.txt) /newFolder\n\nThe \"cp\" and the \"--parents\" flag will copy the files and create the necessary folder tree.\n\n\n*After that, you have to move the folder to the right place, but it´s simple.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: phpMyAdmin login problem: I use Ubuntu 12.04. Recently I have installed XAMPP 1.8.1 in my system. I set password to: XAMPP pages, MySQL/phpMyAdmin, MySQL root and FTP. \nBut after that when I try to login to phpMyAdmin page with username 'root' and my assigned password, it doesn't login and shows a page like: \n\nAlso when I click on 'CD Collection' item from the left panel of my XAMPP page it shows: \nWarning: mysql_connect(): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) in /opt/lampp/htdocs/xampp/cds.php on line 64\nCould not connect to database!\nIs MySQL running or did you change the password?\n\nOh! another thing, I edited the /opt/lampp/etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf file to:\n<Directory \"/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin\">\nAllowOverride AuthConfig Limit\nRequire all granted\n</Directory>\n\nbut no success...\nI am complete newbie to php, mySQL, FTP and this XAMPP. Could anyone please tell me how can I login to my phpMyAdmin page??? did I do anything wrong???\n\nA: A confusing point for almost everyone who starts using mysql is that 'root' and 'root@localhost' are two different roles and as such could (and some would argue that they actually should) have different passwords. It is quite possible you are trying to log-in as user 'root@localhost' and you are providing the password for 'root' role. \nIf this is the case, you can remedy it quite easily. Log-in to the database server using the CLI tool mysql as user root like this:\nmysql --user=root --password\n\nThe tool will ask for your root password (not system root but database root). Now you can modify the password of 'root'@'localhost' like this:\nUPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('cleartext password')\n  WHERE User='root' AND Host='localhost';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nNow try to log-in through phpMyAdmin using the newly set password.\n\nA: Check the following articles:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MysqlPasswordReset\nHow to change root password for mysql and phpmyadmin\n\nA: I have, after 3 days of searching, got my phpMyAdmin working.\nStep 1\nPurge the old phpMyAdmin from the system with:\nsudo apt-get purge phpmyadmin\n\nYou are offered the option of saving any info or deleting the whole lot.\nStep 2\nDownload and install the whole caboodle again with\nsudo apt-get install phpmyadmin\n\nAs you install you are asked for the Admin password (This is the password which you log in with)\nNext you are asked for a password to access the phpMyAdmin UI.\nEnter a new password here (I'll pretend that this is a123z )\nThen confirm your password by entering it in the next box.\nThe script will end soon after\nStep 3\nLogging in to phpMyAdmin\nThe phpMyAdmin can be found at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/\nYour username is: root\nYour password is: a123z\n(Not your log in password!)\nThat's it, you are in and running.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit have graphic user interface? I am new to Virtualbox and Vagrant.\nI followed Vagrant Get Started Guide, and have a VirtualBox running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit.\nhttp://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html\nHowever, there's no graphical user interface (only a terminal).\nCould anyone point me a box with a GUI?\n\nA: By default, no. Server distros don't have a GUI, but you can easily add one using apt-get.\nPeople commonly use Gnome, XFCE etc. A quick search will get you what you need, depending on which Desktop Environment (DE) you're looking for. \nXFCE is great and lightweight. If you're running a server system, you might want that to keep memory free for other applications. \nInstalling XFCE\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nInstalling Gnome\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nAfter installing the desktop, you'll also want to install GDM which will let you boot directly into a graphical environment.

Its wise to backup data on Ubuntu. If anything happens you can recover them.\nThen Login to your Ubuntu as usual and open GParted. Delete the Windows partition and let the GParted finish (Power crash will bring disaster so make sure that Power is available). After tha open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type sudo update-grub Then Reboot. If all went well, you are on track now we go to final stage\nBoot in your Ubuntu DVD/CD/Bootable USB stick and launch GParted. Resize your Ubuntu partitions and wait Gparted to finish. Reboot back to HDD. You are done!\n\nA: \nis there any way i can go about doing that? \n\nNo, you cannot convert your Win8 into a virtual Windows inside Ubuntu.\nHowever, you can remove your current Windows, then create a virtual Windows machine in Ubuntu (eg via VirtuaBox).\n\nIs that even possible since the windows 8 partition was there first? \n\nYes. To remove your current Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your Windows documents.\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu, install and run OS-Uninstaller, select Windows, apply. This will format your Windows partition (NTFS by default, but you can select EXT in the advanced options), and update your bootloader.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and check that you can still boot onto Ubuntu.\n\n*Optionally, you can use Gparted to manage (resize, change the format...) the freed partition.\n\n", "Q: Windows 8 Installation couldn't find drives I am trying to install Windows on Ubuntu using a bootable Windows USB stick.

However, on the \"Where do you want to install Windows?\" installation windows, it doesn't show any available drives. ! \n[No visible drives in the windows 8 installation - \n\nHow do I proceed?\n\nA: Use a boot usb with ubuntu and gparted installed to resize your ubuntu partition, leaving unallocated the ammount of space you want to use for windows 8. Boot from the windows 8 usb to install it on the empty space. Boot back into ubuntu using the boot usb, install boot repair on it, run it to fix grub and you should be ok.\n\nA: I think that is better before to start to install Windows to make from Ubuntu a NTFS partition with GParted. Normally, Windows does not see Linux partitions and because of this you don't have visible drives in the Windows installation.\n", "Q: Unable to Mount anything; USB, internal drives; do not have permissions; HELP! I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a USB on an HP Pavillion.\nI posted a problem about removing Thunderbird.  I was advised to use GKSU Nautilus to become root, or as I understand it, SUPERUSER.  I could NEVER get it to work and I am now afraid I have screwed up my whole LINUX system. I can't get stuff to mount and then other stuff says it can't unmount (see images)\nI have read that either using sudu or gksu can possiblibly lock the user out entirely.\nIt seems that I am completely locked out as an administrator I can't even access the system settings/user accounts!  \nI am now completely overwelmed.  I even tried to create a new USB loaded with 12.10 and was willing to overwrite everything and start new, but without being able to mount another USB I can't even do that.\nI was going to (in desparation) try and run 13.04 from a DVD.  I got as far as getting the ISO and it's files onto a DVD but now the DVD won't mount so I can't use it.\nHave I screwed it all up with the GKSU command or perhaps the sudu?\nIt definitely seems as if I've lost any and all permissions. \nHELP!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nA: First, I don't know why you'd want to use Nautilus to remove Thunderbird. That's just wrong. If you were deleting things with Nautilus as root, you could have nuked anything by mistake. If you're not sure exactly what you erased, I'd not be too concerned with screwing up you whole Linux install, because you probably did. I've hosed my system, and some people re-install weekly, just to try out different distributions.\nSecond, do you have a good backup of all your user files? Things like photos, documents you've created over the years and don't want to lose? If you do, great. If not, I'd do some damage control first. If you can boot to an Ubuntu Live CD or USB, you should be able to plug in the 1 TB USB drive you use for your regular backups, find your home directory on your hard drive and copy everything to a folder on your 1 TB USB drive.\nIf you don't have a large USB drive you use to make regular backups , you need one, and you need to use it.\nAfter you've managed to back up everything, and you're sure you've backed up everything including hidden files in your home directory because you've checked carefully, you can do a clean install and copy everything back if all the other excellent advise you're going to get here can't save your installation.\n", "Q: Added second network adapter and can't get a connection from ether I have since dropped the second Ethernet adapter totally. I still couldn't get it to work so I reinstalled ubuntu (was working with a fresh install anyway) The adapter worked fine to begin. Then I tried to set the static settings in the interfaces file.

You can do similar things with other things with the command line history see here \n\nA: I use zsh instead of bash and have this in my ~/.zshrc, so pressing Alt+S inserts sudo at the beginning of the command line:\ninsert_sudo () { zle beginning-of-line; zle -U \"sudo \" }\nzle -N insert-sudo insert_sudo\nbindkey \"^[s\" insert-sudo\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't track down a way to do the same thing in bash.\n\nA: If you want to do it in an alias, you have to use alias redo='sudo $(history -p !!)' for some reason.\n\nA: The simplest way is to run:\nsudo !!\n\nThis will run the last command but as super user.\nSource.\n\nA: The way I prefer it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Arrow key up\n\n*Home\n\n*\"sudo \"\n\n*Enter\n\n\nBut it might be easier to just do \"sudo !!\", it's up to you.\n\nA: You could try the up-arrow key to scroll through your old commands and rewrite/change them and add the sudo in front of them. (the home button above the arrow keys will set the position to the beginning.)\nI dislike the sudo !! idea, because sometimes you add another command in between and don't remember anymore.\n\nA: This question could have been generalized into \"Run same command but with some modification\", since one of the brilliant design decisions in Unix, is that what's implemented once in the shell, can be leveraged by any command being invoked from the shell.\nIn other words, this trick doesn't apply just  to sudo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeat the previous command as superuser (sudo !!)\n\n*Repeat the previous command and time it (time !!)\n\n*Repeat the previous command with a different environment (env A=b B=z !!)\n\n*Repeat the previous command (!!)\n\n\nHistory expansion (also known as history substitution) is just a shell feature to make repeating previous commands easier (with less keystrokes). Check your shell man page for history expansion.  It describes many more tricks and short-cuts you can do with history for example:\nYou may refer to previous commands by number:\n!55                 # repeat command number 55\n!-1                 # repeat the previous command, alias for !!\n!-2                 # repeat the command before the previous command\n\nYou may refer to individual words in previous commands:\nsome-command !$     # run some-command on the last arg of previous command\n\nYou can also search before repeating:\n!?awk               # repeat the last command including the string 'awk'\n\nYou can search the history and replace something by something else:\n!?awk?:s/str1/str2/  # repeat previous command matching 'awk' replacing str1 by str2\n\nAnd much more, since you can combine command selection, arg-selection, search and replace independently.\nThe man page of your shell (in this case man bash) is your friend.\n\nA: I'll just add an alternative: as short as typing sudo !! and more flexible:\nUp-arrow (once, or until you find the command you want to sudo/edit, if it's older)\nctrl+A   (place cursor at beginning of line)\n\"sudo \"\nEnter\n\nIt's exactly the same number of keystrokes (I count \"ctrl+A\" as one...), but adding \"up arrow\" you can do it on whichever command is in your history.\n\nA: su -c \"!!\"\n\nIf you do not have permission to be root with sudo or sudo program did not install on system.\n", "Q: PulseAudio is not working at all I installed PulseAudio two weeks ago and since then I've been trying to open it and it doesn't.\nDoes anyone have any solution?\nP.S.

The video chip is Intel 865G Extreme Graphics 2. Previous versions of Xubuntu looked normal, but with 13.04 I seem to have degraded color depth. For example, the stock wallpapers are gradient images, and they appear with 'banding'. Also, any video looks really bad. I tested 13.04 on a new Acer laptop and it looked great, and I checked the color palette settings to compare with the one I'm having trouble with, and they were the same. I would guess the diagnostic process would consist of identifying whether or not this video device is still supported, then move on to identify if the video driver is faulty, missing or incorrect. Any suggestions to put me on the right track? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: It seems like there was a video driver issue, I compiled the latest xf86-video-intel driver from the git repo  --- (here is the exact tar.gz I downloaded).\nNOTE: If you don't want to do all this craziness and want to try this PPA of the git repo instead feel free: http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/xorg-edgers\nThey just warned me that I should install ALL of the things, so I took their advice and built the driver in my environment.\nThis guide might work, but here are the steps I remember taking:\n$ tar xvfz xf86-video-intel-2.21.8.tar.gz\n$ cd xf86-video-intel-2.21.8/\n$ sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool xutils-dev xserver-xorg-dev\n$ ./autogen\n$ ./configure # This might not be necessary, but I ran it...\n$ sudo make install\n\nI then uninstalled the current drivers through the software center, you can probably just do an $ apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-intel\nTHEN the moment of truth... $ sudo killall Xorg to restart X and load our new drivers (At least I think that's what happened hehe)\nEither way, the gradients look smoother, I haven't even tried watching a video on this computer yet.\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: This is how i solved it on my Xubuntu 13.04\nAfter finding out that the colordepth was 16, and I needed 24, I had too change xorg.conf, but xorg.conf did not exist in /etc/X11/xorg.conf so this had to be created.

To my experience, restoring these settings by copying them back is safe as long as you stay with the same software versions (i.e. those that come with Xubuntu 12.10 in your case). Also back up your .deb packages in /var/cache/apt/archives; use them to remember what software was installed. (Tools such as gdebi or APTonCD may help.)\nFor backing up, consider copying the entire partition using gparted from the Live CD.

Crashes and Bugs\n  may sound like bad things, but actually most operating systems will\n  have several a day, and it doesn't mean your computer is broken, nor\n  does it necessarily stop working. As such, Apport can usually be\n  safely disabled, as it doesn't fix anything, it just tells developers\n  that something went wrong.\n\nAll the commands below require that you open Terminal to run the commands.  To open Terminal, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard.  When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nYou can stop Apport for the running session with:\nsudo service apport stop\n\nTo disable, you have to edit the apport file, and Change the line that says enabled=1 to enabled=0\nsudo gedit /etc/default/apport\n\nOr you can remove Apport:\nsudo apt-get purge apport\n\nNote: I personally don't recommend that you disable it.\nSource: How to Ubuntu\n", "Q: Places opens in Disk Usage Analyzer in Ubuntu 13.04 I have updated my ubuntu from 12.10 to latest Ubuntu 13.04. everything is fine but when i go to Places and click any place, it opens in Disk Usage Analyzer by default and i found no way to either stop Disk usage analyzer permanantely or to change the default Application for Places.

After trying the other solutions (removing MimeType=inode/directory; and editing /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache) what actually fixed the problem was to run this command as your user:\nxdg-mime default nautilus.desktop  inode/directory\n\nBy default it is set to use nautilus-folder-handler.desktop, which for some reason ends up launching the dreaded baobab.\n\nA: When I went to https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1186209#p1186209 I've found the solution in there.\nRemove MimeType=inode/directory; from /usr/share/applications/baobab.desktop and run as root \nupdate-desktop-database -q\n\n\nA: I had the same problem when occasionally removed nautilus.\nTrysudo dpkg-reconfigure nautilus\n\nA: I'm running Kubuntu 17.10 and had a similar problem (in my case, it opened git-cola). Thanks to richq's answer I figured out the problem, but the solution different enough to warrant a separate answer:\nOpen File Associations (if plasma search doesn't find it: System Settings under Applications).\nExpand inode and find directory - type it in the top-left search to filter out the rest:\n\nIn Application Preference Order, select the application you want to use. \nIf it isn't at the top already, move it up, click Apply and see if this fixes things. \nOtherwise, click Edit..., and open the application tab. \nThe Command field (fourth from the top) is probably not pointing to the actual program, so fix that. Make sure you keep the %U at the end!\nFor example, for Dolphin, it should probably look like this:\n\nIf you do not know where your desired application is stored, open a terminal and run whereis <application> (it's probably in /usr/bin/).\nAnyway, that fixed it for me, hopefully this works for others too.\n", "Q: workspace switching via ctrl + alt + arrow not working after upgrade to 13.04, how to fix this?

It will not be unlocked unless you enter your password, so it is safe :-)\nYou can however change the behavior of the connections. If you go to Edit Connections... in the networking menu and edit a connection, there is an option on the General tab called All users may connect to this network.

I tried re-installing whole empathy package (and reboot a few times in the process), but it didn't work. Any idea what to do now?\n\nA: Pidgin should be rock solid with GTalk - I've been using it on my Ubuntu 12.04 for about a year now, so I suspect either your system (how did you build/install Pidgin, do you have any unusual plug-ins enabled?), or a networking issue (do you have firewalls or proxies in place that would affect internet access?).\nHowever, Google are also in the process of migrating GTalk accounts to Hangouts, so there might be some issues around that. Some stories report that they're dropping xmpp support entirely, but that would appear to be false - they're dropping xmpp \"server\" support, so clients will continue to work, but you won't be able to federate your own Jabber servers to Hangouts like you could in the past.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 and Inspiron 6400 What driver do I need for Ubuntu 12.4 to work with a Dell Inspiron 6400?

Now we need to pull some data from our clients FTP Server (i.e. Machine \"B\") to our server (i.e. Machine \"A\") and then process it. after that we need to put the processed data back on to the client's FTP Server (i.e. Machine \"B\"). that's what is not working\n\n\n*Logs of clients firewall when we tried to connect with machine \"B\" as shown in below image.\n\n\n\nA: Add to your vsftpd config (/etc/vsftpd.conf):\npasv_enable=YES\nport_enable=YES\npasv_min_port=<port-start>\npasv_max_port=<port-end>\npasv_address=<your-machine-ip>\npasv_addr_resolve=NO\n\nIn the security config of your instance open port 20-21 for FTP, also enable passive ports to the range you specified above (pasv_min/max_port, eg: 64000-64100).\nRestart vsftpd.\nif that doesn't work you can try to replace the last two lines with:\npasv_address=<public-address>\npasv_addr_resolve=YES\n\n\nA: This is my understanding of your scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have Machine A in Your Network with an FTP Server and an FTP Client;\n\n*You want to pull files from Machine B that is in Client's Network;\n\n*There is a firewall in Your Network and possibly in Client's Network;\n\n*You will use FTP client to push and pull files from Machine B.\n\n\n\nFTP works in two modes:\n- Active Mode -\nIn active mode FTP, the client connects from a random unprivileged port (N > 1023) to the FTP server's command port, port 21. Then, the client starts listening to port N+1 and sends the FTP command PORT N+1 to the FTP server. The server will then connect back to the client's specified data port (...)\nExample:\n\n\n*\n\n*FTP client in machine \"A\" connects to FTP server in machine \"B\" on port 21;\n\n*Machine \"A\" sends \"ls\" to machine \"B\", but because it is Active Mode, the result of \"ls\" will be delivered to port N+1 (N>1023) of machine \"A\";\n\n*This fails because FTP client in machine \"A\" asks machine \"B\" to connect to a private IP. Even if the IP is public, the ports N+1 must be open in the firewall.\n\n\n- Passive Mode -\nIn passive mode FTP, the client initiates both connections to the server, solving the problem of firewalls filtering the incoming data port connection to the client from the server. When opening an FTP connection, the client opens two random unprivileged ports locally (N > 1023 and N+1). The first port contacts the server on port 21, but instead of then issuing a PORT command and allowing the server to connect back to its data port, the client will issue the PASV command. The result of this is that the server then opens a random unprivileged port (P > 1023) and sends P back to the client in response to the PASV command. The client then initiates the connection from port N+1 to port P on the server to transfer data. (...)\nExample:\n\n\n*\n\n*FTP client in machine \"A\" connects to FTP server in machine \"B\" on port 21;\n\n*Machine \"A\" sends \"ls\" to machine \"B\";\n\n*This time, the result will not be delivered to port N+1 of machine \"A\". Instead, machine \"B\" informs machine \"A\" that the result is waiting to be fetched in a given IP and port of machine \"B\".\n\n*This fails when this IP is private and port is not open in client's firewall. That is why the client must configure his FTP server to use a public IP and a known port (see Cubiq's answer).\n\n\nThese are the solutions you have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Active Mode (considering that machine \"A\" has IP 175.41.135.142): Right after connection and authentication, issue this command: PORT 175,41,135,142,14,178 You will need to open port 3762 in you firewall. The ,14,178 comes from the convertion of octets to decimal ((14*256) + 178).\n\n*Using Passive Mode: For this method to work, the client must have a configuration like Cubiq's answer. Right after the connection and authentication, issue this command: passive\nNow you should be able to \"ls\".\nYou can read more about how FTP works here: http://slacksite.com/other/ftp.html\nThis page is also good to understand the FTP modes: http://www.deskshare.com/resources/articles/ftp-how-to.aspx\n\nA: *\n\n*I received the same message when I used File Zilla.

Any suggestions? Thank you in advance.\n\nNote:I'm executing this through putty from a Windows OS.\n\nA: That's because -O - tells wget to write the file content to stdout (your terminal) instead of saving it to a file.\nThe actual instructions at https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx, say:\n32-bit:\ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86\" | tar xzf -\n\n64-bit:\ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64\" | tar xzf -\n\nwhich has wget output the file contents (which is a gzipped tar archive) to a pipe with a tar command on the other end.

Safari tries to open files it downloads. You don't open the file that you download. You need to burn it to a DVD and then boot from that.\n", "Q: Testing my system, I need a script that will use as much ram and swap as possible I'm testing my system with zram, I need a script that will use as much ram as possible. This script should fill up my ram with random stuff not just zeros.\n\nA: memtester is a user space program designed to allocate memory (any amount you specify) and test it with random patterns. It will avoid swap usage though. But if you take all memory away with memtester first (check with free -m) and then start anything else that uses a lot of memory (gimp, firefox, ...), that should get the swap going.\nAnother alternative would be something like openssl rand -base64 $((1024*1024*1024)) | less and in less use > to jump to the last line; this will cause 1GB of base64 encoded random data to be loaded in memory (but it's slow).\nIf you're looking for something more efficient, a small script in any scripting language (e.g. Python) might do.\n#!/usr/bin/python2\nimport numpy\nresult = [numpy.random.bytes(1024*1024) for x in xrange(1024)]\nprint len(result)\n\nThat would allocate 1G of memory with random data and print the number of MB allocated before terminating. If you want more than 1024M, adapt the xrange value accordingly.\n\nA: As prophecy201 suggested, stress is a great tool to use up your system's memory. Adding more workers will use up more RAM, but it will also use up more CPU, which is pretty ineffecient if all you want is to test RAM. Not to mention that the CPU will be needed by zram for compression.\nInstead, you should increase the amount of RAM that is used with the --vm-bytes flag. For example, to use up 4 GB of RAM with one worker:\nstress -m 1 --vm-bytes 4G\n\nYou may also find the --vm-keep flag helpful as it will hold the memory allocation instead of continually reallocating, so the memory usage will be constant instead of fluctuating:\nstress -m 1 --vm-bytes 4G --vm-keep\n\nLastly, take a look here to make sure zram is what you really want; since you do have swap, zswap may be a better solution: zram vs zswap vs zcache Ultimate guide: when to use which one\n\nA: I would suggest to use the program stress, installable from the repositories with sudo apt-get install stress.\nTo test your RAM use stress -m x where x is the number of workers which will fill up the ram. Choose more workers to use more RAM.\n\nA: Just run :\necho {1..1000000000}\n\nExplanation :\nThe Shell, Before giving the command to the kernel, Expands all the regular expressions and short-hands. The expanded command is temporarily stored in RAM. The above command expands to a very large command and hence it will completely fill the RAM (tested on 8GB).\nWARNING : This is not a controlled way of filling RAM. You might get stuck after running this command. I advice you to keep your system monitor open (for watching RAM usage) and try with smaller numbers.\n\nA: Expect zswap to work extremely badly---make performance much worse---if you fill memory with random bytes, especially if you randomly touch lots of memory in a hurry.\nzram compresses the contents of pages of memory, and compression only works if the data are not random.  Real data (especially in-memory data) is usually fairly compressible. \nzram also only helps if you have \"locality of reference\", like most programs have---they tend to touch the same pages repeatedly before touching some other subset of pages.  (This is why normal virtual memory works, too.  Compressed caching is just adding a new level of memory between normal uncompressed pages and disk storage.)\nIf you know this, and are intentionally trying to test zswap under worst-case conditions, maybe to find bugs, go for it.\nBut if not, you should probably read Paul R. Wilson et al's paper \"The Case for Compressed Caching in Virtual Memory systems,\" which explains when RAM compression helps, when it hurts, and how an adaptive algorithm can use in when it helps and not when it doesn't.  (The paper is online in html on some USENIX site, and in pdf form somewhere else.  Google it.)\nUnfortunately, as far as I know zram does not do the kind of general automatic adaptation they describe, so you have to set the compressed cache size at some reasonable usual value for your workload.\nOne case where that will work well is if you have more RAM than any one of your programs uses, but tend to have idle applications using up memory too, and switch between apps.  Idle apps' pages will tend to get compressed, and when you switch back to them, they only need to be uncompressed rather than loaded from disk.\n", "Q: How to Stream video from iPad to Ubuntu 13.04 Could you advise how to stream video from iPad to Ubuntu 13.04 ?\nI've tried the teamviewer, but it doesn't support from ipad -> ubuntu.\nAppreciate any ideas,\nVladimir Zateychuk\nskype: vzateychuk\n\nA: You can try XBMC, which can be easily configured (settings > network) to receive airplay content (audio & video).

It results in an error as shown\n\"Cannot open display\".\nDoes Ubuntu Touch supports the window management? How to achieve this?\n\nA: wmctrl is a UNIX/Linux command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager. \nUbuntu Desktop still uses compiz as its compositing window manager, which talks to X server. so wmctl is applicable.\nwhile Ubuntu Touch is moving towards a new graphics infrastructure based on mir, which is a replacement for X server. So there's no X11 stuff on Ubuntu Touch, no DISPLAY environment variable.  \nwmctl expects the X11 DISPLAY environment variable and it complains \"Cannot open display\" when it's not there.\n", "Q: What is the method to manage network interfaces in Ubuntu 12.04? After upgrading two instances of an older Ubuntu (10.10 and 11.04) to 12.04, I notice an apparent conflict between the way my network interfaces were previously managed and the new methodology, which apprently is extremely \"Network-Manager-Centric.\"\nIt seems that my previous configurations, stored in /etc/network/interfaces, continue to work, but tools like 'dhclient' not longer function as expected. Now, in order to re-configure the interface between a static IP and a DHCP IP, I've discovered the best solution is to comment out all but the 'lo' adapter in the /etc/network/interfaces file, and just perform all my configuraion changes with Network Manager.\nMy question is 2-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this expected behavior, as part of some kind of long-term plan to exclusively use Network Manager?\n\n*Is there documentation which describes the current state of network interface management in Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: You can disable the networkmanager, take a look at this link.\nBut why does dhclient not work (or is not working as expected)? Have you altered the dhclient.conf?\ndhclient <NIC> \"should\" almost always work.  \n", "Q: You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user From launchpad I have an email containing OpenPGP encrypted key.

But my root password or mail password anything won't work there and I am not clear about this passphrase.\nHowever, what can I do now?\n\nA: If the E-Mail was send to you it was encrypted with your public key and can only be unlocked using your private key. You have to enter the passphrase you choose when creating the key pair.\nIf it is not encrypted with your key, the sender got it wrong or it was not meant for you in the first place. You'll have no way to decrypt it without the matching private key and it's passphrase.\n", "Q: No desktop icons after uninstalling nemo I tested nemo on Ubuntu 12.04. I made it the default file manager.

For example, if I type \"μοῖρα\" in size 12, the character \"ῖ\" appears in size 14, though formally it says 12. If it is typed in 14, it will appear in 16, 18 in 20, and so on...\nThis does not happen with ubuntu fonts.\nI've already reinstalled the fonts but the problem continues.\nedit: I am using Times New Roman\n\nA: I haven't been able to reproduce this (all of of my polytonic Greek letters are the right size), but this problem happens when the font doesn't have the particular glyph needed and defaults to a backup font to supply the glyph. Not all Unicode fonts have all the glyphs needed for a particular language. The larger size for one or two characters is common with Windows fonts when the missing glyph is pulled in from Tahoma or the equivalent. \nYou didn't mention the specific font you are using, but the solution is usually to find a specialized free font that is guaranteed to have all of the needed glyphs, such as Galatia SIL  for polytonic Greek.\n", "Q: Convert bootable USB stick to ISO file I am trying to get an ISO file from a bootable USB memory stick. The device name for the stick is dev/sdf1. In this answer: Convert bootable USB to ISO file , dd was suggested for copying. So I did: \nsudo dd if=/dev/sdf1 of=win7.iso\n\nHowever, the stick has a size of 30G, but only 12G are used. Running the command above, it creates an iso image larger than 12G, I stopped dd when the file was > 20G, since I ran out of disk space. \nIs it normal that the ISO file gets so big or is there another way to achieve my goal?\n\nA: dd is a 1:1 copy, it copies the entire device regardless what's on it. If you only copy a partition (sdf1) it's unlikely to be bootable as the bootloader usually resides on sdf MBR.\nIf the free space is zeroed, you could save the free space by use of gzip.\nTo zero the free space, you may use:\nmount /dev/sdf1 /mnt/tmp\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M | split -b 1G - /mnt/tmp/zerofile\nsync\nrm /mnt/tmp/zerofile*\numount /mnt/tmp\n\nTo create a gzip compressed image:\ndd if=/dev/sdf bs=1M | gzip > win7.img.gz\n\nTo restore from that image, it's:\ngunzip < win7.img.gz | dd of=/dev/sdf bs=1M\n\nOther alternatives are partimage or ntfsclone (in case of ntfs), which only store files, not free space, however the result may not be bootable as it's not a 1:1 copy.\n\nA: You can compress the image like this\ndd if=/dev/sdf1 conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | gzip -c  > usb.img.gz\n\nThat way, it will not copy the blank parts of the usb stick.\nAlso dd creates a disk image, not an iso.\n", "Q: Installing software center ubuntu Okay so I recently had some problems with ubuntu software centre where if I opened it from the dashboard it would open up, but only display a white screen.

Run boot-repair while in Ubuntu, and have it Scan your available HDDs/systems (will do this automatically usually), or if you're aware of how to configure GRUB on your own, set it up manually yourself.\n\n*Alternatively, you could do the painful method and assign the boot order in the BIOS manually every single time you want to switch systems... but that seems painful and unnecessary if you can simply use GRUB the whole time.\nIf you have any questions or issues regarding configuring GRUB to boot off of the second disk, I'd recommend you visit this link for some basic rundowns of how to do this.

Feel free to post follow-ups if you have issues.\n", "Q: How do I build juju-core from source? I'm interested in compiling and running juju-core from source. How can I do this? What are the risks involved?\n\nA: Before going in to this, according to the README in juju-core:\n\nNote that the use of --upload-tools forces the instances to run with the same\n  series and architecture of your development system.  Currently the only\n  supported architecture that can be deployed is amd64, so you must develop on\n  64-bit machines.\n\nIf you do not have an amd64 machine, or are trying to compile for i386, ARM, etc these steps will likely not work.\nSetup Dependencies\nThe following packages are required to build juju-core:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential bzr zip git-core mercurial golang-go\n\nThe golang-go package will prompt you about anonymous usage statistics and if you wish to opt-in. Select Yes or No depending on your interest.\nAfter installation you'll need to create a GOPATH, which is what go will use for downloading and compiling dependencies. You can set this to any directory you choose, for example ~/go. You can read more about gopath with go help gopath\nexport GOPATH=${HOME}/go\nmkdir -p $GOPATH\n\nThen prefix or append GOPATH to your PATH. It's recommended you prefix your PATH as it'll give you your compiled version by default. You'll still be able to access other installed versions of Juju, though you'll have to use an absolute path to access them. If you do not wish to have GOPATH in your path, you can bypass this step.\nPATH=\"$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\"\n\nBuilding & Installing\nOnce your environment is setup, build juju-core is a relatively straight forward process. You'll first need to get the latest code for juju-core in a manner that go will know what to do with. Simply run the following command to fetch the latest source:\ngo get -v launchpad.net/juju-core/...\n\nThis will have go fetch juju-core and the source of all dependencies. Finally, to build juju-core run:\ngo install -v launchpad.net/juju-core/...\n\nThis should take a few seconds to complete. Once finished you can verify juju compiled properly by running which juju if you prefixed your PATH with GOPATH. If not you can verify it's installed with $GOPATH/bin/juju version which should report the current compiled version of juju-core.\nUsing\nOnce juju-core is built and you're able to use it as you like, there are a few caveats to be made aware of. First, whenever you run a bootstrap you'll need to include the --upload-tools flag, otherwise you'll end up having the 'released' version of the juju-core tools installed instead of the newly compiled ones.\njuju bootstrap -e <your_environment> --upload-tools\n\nAlso, juju-core isn't compatible with previously deployed juju versions less than 0.7 (the python version of juju). You'll need to create new environments.yaml definitions and use different control-bucket keys. If you want to maintain two separate environment files you can do so by specifying a JUJU_HOME environment variable:\nexport JUJU_HOME=~/.juju-core\nmkdir -p $JUJU_HOME\njuju init -w\n\nThis will create a new boilerplate environments.yaml file in ~/.juju-core/ where you can maintain your juju-core environments separate from previous versions of juju.\nRemoval\nIf you wish to remove the compiled version of juju-core you can do so at anytime by running rm -rf $GOPATH. This should return your system back to a state prior to when you had your compiled source version of juju-core.\n", "Q: Is there a log of package management activity like recent removals?

But how can I make it so the user sets a password and the other person has to put in that password to decrypt the message.\n\nA: Based on the tags in your question (qt & c++), I assume you intend on using the Qt framework. Thankfully, there is a library available for Qt that can do this for you. And the best part is that the library is already included in the main archives.\nThe library I'm referring to is called QCA - Qt Cryptographic Architecture and is available through the libqca2  and libqca2-dev  packages. You will also want to install the libqca2-plugin-ossl  package, which provides runtime support for the OpenSSL functions.\n\nNote: before going any further, I should point out that QCA is only available for Qt 4.x at the time of writing and may not work with Qt 5.x.\n\nRather than going into a lot of detail on using the QCA library, I will instead point you to this example which demonstrates how to use the AES128 algorithm to securely encrypt a message with a passphrase and then decrypt it later with the same passphrase.\n", "Q: replace or remove evince I want to use my own document viewer (okular) and never want to see evince again. \nIn Ubuntu 13.04 when I try 'dpkg -P evince' it says that ubuntu-desktop depends on it.\n\nA: You should not use the dpkg command directly to manage packages in general, but should use the apt-get command instead. It is generally safe for the ubuntu-desktop package to be removed, as it is a meta-package that only depends on other packages. Nothing should be depending on it.\nSimply doing sudo apt-get remove --purge evince will show you what packages exactly will need to be removed as a result of evince's removal. You can accept or deny the transaction. If you accept, then evince and ubuntu-desktop will both be purged, as will any other packages which apt-get lists as needing removal when you run the command.\n", "Q: Prevent a specific USB device from auto-mounting I want to stop a USB device from automounting in Ubuntu 13.04. For example, when I connect my iPhone 5 to my desktop I am consistently prompted for what I want to do (whether or not I want to erase the \"iPod\" connected to my machine, etc). Since I don't use the computer as anything more than a way to charge the device, is there a way to prevent the device from mounting and still allow the device to draw current from the machine?\n\nA: Using the terminal and gedit\nFirst find the ID for your device from a terminal using lsusb when your device is connected (eg 0951:1692). Also you should to find what is the name of your device with lsblk. Let say the name is /dev/sdb1.\nCreate a new script, let say unmount.sh in /lib/udev with sudo -H gedit /lib/udev/unmount.sh and put next lines inside:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nudisks --unmount /dev/sdb1\nudisks --detach /dev/sdb\n\nSave the file, close it and make it executable with:\nchmod +x /lib/udev/unmount.sh\n\nNow, you must to make a new rule file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ with sudo -H gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/100-unmount-iphone.rulesand put a new rule in there like this:\nACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0951\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1692\", RUN+=\"/lib/udev/unmount.sh\"\n\n\n\n\nTo reload udev rules without restart, use next command:\nsudo udevadm control --reload-rules\n\nUsing Cuttlefish\nOr, another way is to install and use Cuttlefish  - a simple tool that realises reflexes on your computer.\n\nA: To control which programs automatically start when you plug in a device, go to \n\nSystem-Settings - Details - Removable Media\n\n\nSource: Ubuntu Documentation - Mount/USB\n", "Q: Enable navigation buttons and address area in XFCE I just installed the xfce Desktop environment  and I can't find the navigation buttons and the address area in the file manager.\n\nin other Desktop environment  I can find this feature : \n\nHow can I enable this feature.\n\nA: The solution depends on XFCE version.

I just noticed by chance that the disks started failing in one of my boxes, and I somehow expected Landscape to alert me to this condition.\nDo I need to just enable that somewhere, or is there a way to add a custom sensor? If so, how to make sure I will get alerted in time?\n\nA: There is no way to add a custom alert. You could graph some SMART value, but you would have to keep checking that graph to notice something is wrong.\n\nA: Here is how'd you do this with Landscape:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a package profile or simply install smartmontools on all devices with a given tag (say, \"smart\")\n\n*create a custom graph charting the following: \n/usr/sbin/smartctl -A /dev/sda | grep Reallocated_Sector_Ct |tr -s ' '|cut -d' ' -f11\nAssign it to all the machines tagged \"smart\" to execute.\n\n\n*Examine the custom graph, and look for numbers too high for your class of hard disks to tolerate (big difference between consumer and enterprise drives here).\n\n\nGraphs do not trigger alerts in the current Landscape release, so you would have to review the graphs for irregularities.

has worked for me in Firefox (Ubuntu 16.04 64bit).\nThe only way for me to get Webex fully working was to install VirtualBox and then install Windows as a virtual OS. Yes, it's a bit inconvenient to run a virtual OS each time you need Webex, but you can be 100% certain that it will work perfectly (voice, video, screen sharing).\nGood luck!\n\nA: I have ubuntu 64bit 12.04\nI did this looking from steps from certain forums and questions.\n* Install Firefox 32 bit (had to unistall the 64 bit one).\n\n\n*\n\n*goto Synaptic and select arch i386 \n\n*install ia32-libs-multiarch:i386 \n\n*goto arch amd64 \n\n*install ia32-libs:amd64\n\n*goto arch i386 \n\n*install firefox:i386\n\n\n* Download java jre 32 bit\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the tar for 32bit from the official site\n\n*mkdir -p $HOME/opt/java32/\n\n*mv Downloads/jre-7u21-linux-i586.tar.gz  $HOME/opt/java32/\n\n*cd  $HOME/opt/java32/\n\n*tar -xzvf jre-7u21-linux-i586.tar.gz\n\n*cd ~/opt/java32/jre1.7.0_21\n\n*mkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins/\n\n*ln -sf $PWD/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/\n* Download adobe flash plugin\n\n\n*\n\n*search for it and download it from the official site\n\n*mkdir ~/opt/adobe-flash\n\n*mv ~/Downloads/install_flash_player_11_linux.i386.tar.gz ~/opt/adobe-flash\n\n*extract that file and cd to the dir\n\n*cp libflashplayer.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/\n\n*sudo cp -r usr/* /usr/\nI was good to go after that.\n", "Q: Install nodes error (could not find kernel image) I am just starting to test MAAS. I installed ubuntu 13.04 i386 server with maas option, modified /etc/maas/import_pxe_files to add raring to RELEASES (also import_ephemerals), and ran maas-import-pxe-files, no error returned.\nWhen I try to install a node, it gets an ip from maas-dhcp, and tries to boot from tftp but then the following error appears:\nCould not find kernel image: i386/generic/raring/commissioning/linux\nI looked for the files in /var/lib/maas/tftp, but from there the only path to the image is i386/generic/raring/install/linux\nNote, \"install\" instead of \"commissioning\"\nI somehow found that there is a \"purpose\" option for some tftp python scripts, with possible values \"install\" or \"commissioning\",  but i dont know how to change it, or how can i say that the images are in the \"install\" directory\nOr what i am missing, did i miss a step to properly configure nodes installation?\nThanks in advance,\n\nA: I suspect you added 'amd64' or 'i386' as the ARCH.  You need to add ARCH as 'i386/generic' or 'amd64/generic' in /etc/maas/import_ephemerals\n\nA: same problem to me.\ni just add soft link in /var/lib/maas/tftp/amd64/generic/precise\n\ncd /var/lib/maas/tftp/amd64/generic/precise\n\nand\n\nsudo sudo ln -s install commissioning\n\n\nA: I also got error like \"could not find kernel image : i386/generic//install/linux \" while booting node after pressing start node button via GUI. I found that this error caused because I didn't choose Release type for the node. So after I chose \"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangolin\" for the specific node and then boot again , everything is fine.\n", "Q: Apache redirects all hosts to external url Apache suddenly began to redirect all my local hosts ( ex. test.dev ) to external url. How to trace that, or any solution pls.\n\nA: If you're not using a local DNS server, you need to specify the local hosts in the /etc/hosts file. Just add\n127.0.0.1      test.dev\n\nas a new line to that file. Maybe you have to restart the Apache, but then test.dev should point to your local machine again.\n", "Q: Nginx Basic Auth and subfolders I have a problem with subfolders in a basic auth procted folder. In the protected folder i have a folder named phpmyadmin, which contains phpmyadmin. Im not able to run phpmyadmin, when basic is activated. Whenn i call the the folder, i get a save-as dialog (type: application/octet-stream (18,3 KB)).\nHere the important parts of mysites-available/default\nlocation ^~ /administration/ {\n    auth_basic            \"Restricted Area\";\n    auth_basic_user_file  /var/www/myproject/sec/htpasswd;\n}\n\nlocation ~ \\.php$ {\n    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;\n    fastcgi_index index.php;\n    include fastcgi_params;\n}\n\nAny ideas, how i can run php in basic-auth protected subfolders?\nEDIT: Without basic_auth phpmyadmin is running without problems. \n\nA: Basically you have to do it like this: (pseudocode, sorry)\nlocation /administration/ {\n    <auth_stuff here>\n    location ~ \\.php {\n        <php inside auth here>\n    }\n}\n\nThat's because auth only affects the location it is in.\nI guess you could try removing ^~ (which tells nginx to stop searching, so the php location never matches for that directory) and see if it still requires auth despite not being explicitely required in the PHP block. It probably won't...\nUnrelated but please also read http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls#Passing_Uncontrolled_Requests_to_PHP\n", "Q: Activate dash after minimal GUI installation on Ubuntu Server I installed the ubuntu desktop package without recommends on Ubuntu server 12.04 and noticed that dash does not work - it just won't find any applications (screenshot). How can I activate it? I assume that some required packages were not installed (on the other hand, dependencies are always checked...). Appriciate any help.\n\nA: Try apt-get install gnome-terminal\nThat should do the trick.\nUpdate:\nIt might be related to the icon cache. Take a look at that answer.\nMy guess it that the highcolor-icon-theme package is missing or messed up.\n\nA: I think the problem is, since you did a minimal install, you don't have any of the scopes and lens that come by default in unity. If you look at the bottom of your dash, it only shows the home dash, not any applications, files, music... etc options.\nTry this:\nsudo apt-get install unity-lens-applications\n\nAnd then log out and log in again.\nYou can also install unity-lens-files unity-lens-music unity-lens-photos... etc if you need them.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to start dhclient at boot?

This may be a completely stupid question, but here goes. I've been having issues with my network. This is not an ISP problem, since the internet works perfectly on my mac partition and on the other computers in my house. The internet on Ubuntu works intermittently, and once I have gained access to a sever, I can continue navigating on that server without issue. But when I try to access other servers, about half of the time the server cannot be found. Restarting my wifi will sometimes resolve the issue temporarily, sometimes it will not. Because other computers and partitions operate without issue, I am fairly confident this is a software issue in Ubuntu.Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: If it's really a DNS problem, why don't you try changing the DNS provider? By default, most of the routers act themselves as DNS providers, you could try to change to any of the avaliable on the net, like 8.8.8.8 (google).\n\nYou can change it in network manager settings, editing the connection you are using (wireless or cable) and under IPv4 parameters adding the DNS ip on the box.\n\nGood luck! \n", "Q: Broken Package when trying to install libminiupnpc-dev I'm not sure how to resolve the following broken package errors.

Is there any way I can have it JUST restore the file I'm asking for without wasting an hour scanning every single file it can find.\n\nA: I don't have first hand experience with deja-dup, but according to Google it uses duplicity which in turn uses tar for its backup archives. It is the nature of tar that it does not support direct access to files but instead has to scan the archive until it comes across the desired file. There are alternative archive formats such as dar which provide direct file access. So if fast access to single files is a requirement for you, another backup solution might do a better job for you there.\n\nA: Per manpage: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/deja-dup.1.html\n\nSYNTAX: deja-dup --restore FILES\nEXAMPLE: deja-dup --restore /usr/lib/cgi-bin/somefile.txt\n\nThis will restore the last known copy of this file.  So if your last backup was on 5/15/2014, then only data up to 5/15/2014 will be present in somefile.txt .  I've actually run this command myself and verified it works.  NOTE* even though you're running it from command line, a gui window will popup asking for you to confirm the backup location and password, etc...  Don't worry, it will only restore the file you specified at command line.    Cheers\n\nA: To restore a single file, visit the folder where the file lives (or used to live). Right click on the file and select \"Revert to Previous Version....\" or right click in the directory (i.e. open the directory and right click someplace where there is no icon) and select \"Restore missing files...\" \nThis is more or less taken from \nIs there an easy way to get a single folder out of a Deja-Dup backup?\n\nA: Restoring a file after OS re-installation\nHere is how you do it on Ubuntu Desktop (assuming you know the location and name of the file).\nCase: Your OS was corrupted, you had performed a backup already before corruption, and now have to reinstall the Desktop OS Ubuntu and deja dup) to restore a file, some files, or the whole backup.\nNote: this will only work if when reinstalling the fresh OS you used the same user as before, so if before your user had a home of /home/me,\nwith the fresh install you also end up with the user me with home /home/me and also reuse the old password so they are no issues with permissions or ownerships.\nHow to do it:\nLet's say your file was in the folder Documents and it was called myfile. With the new OS in place you create a dummy file on Documents also called myfile. (same location and name as the one inside the backup). Right click on the file and choose Revert to Previous Version... Point to the backup where the file exists, and depending on how many backups of the file there are, you will be given the option to choose by date a version. And yes, there will be scanning of the backup or backups involved, but if the file exists you will presented with it.\nI have restored files this way. As long the dummy file you use has the same name and extension and is in the exact same location as file you want to restore, this procedure will work. Case sensitive as well.\nBy the way, a way to avoid having so many versions of backups is to once in a while delete all backups and do a fresh backup. I do this every six months or so. Just delete all files inside the your backup folder and do a fresh one. Less space used, less time to find what you are looking for...\nI know this works, because I had to figure this out after a couple of hard drive failures over the years. With this procedure you can actually restore the whole backup to newly fresh OS installation, but nowadays I just restore a few files needed, because the whole backup also restores unwanted old OS settings files. The whole point of a fresh installation is to start with fresh settings.\n", "Q: \"unknown file system\" error in fstab when trying to mount a cifs share Anyone have an idea why a cifs mounted share suddenly doesn't work in fstab?

So for example, if you've recreated the Pictures folder in the same place it used to be (which is in the Home folder) then you should edit that line to look like this:\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Pictures\"\n\nNote: it's case sensitive. So if your folder is \"pictures\", the directory would be $HOME/pictures.\nSave the file and close the window. Close Nautilus (the file manager) if you have it open, and reopen it. You should see your Pictures folder in the links on the left, and you should also see the icon of the folder change to its default one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installed GRUB over rEFIt I had my Mac set up with rEFIt and installed Ubuntu 13.04, unfortunately GRUB was installed over rEFIt. I was not expecting this and have since found out that I have no idea where my installation disk is for OSX 10.8. I want to boot to OSX, but I cannot do boot repair using any OSX tools since I have lost the ability to boot to this. Any suggestions?\nGRUB lists the Ubuntu options along with Mac OSX 32 and 64bit, neither of which work.\n\nA: Try holding down the Option key while powering on the computer. This should enable you to boot OS X, from which you can re-install rEFIt (or install rEFInd instead, if you care to upgrade, since rEFIt is no longer being maintained).\n\nA: I actually figured this out. The easiest way in any situation where GRUB overwrites rEFIt is to hit C when the GRUB screen loads. This will bring up the grub command line. Typing exit here will exit GRUB and show you rEFIt. From here a boot into OSX will allow you to uninstall GRUB and install rEFInd.\n\nA: The following did the job for me (based on iamwpj's suggestion):\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*In the Grub menu, press escape.\n\n*You get a command line. Type exit.\n\n*rEFIt/rEFInd will show up. Boot OS X.\n\n*Tell Startup Disk that you want to boot your OS X install by default.\n\n*Reboot. Your computer will automatically boot OS X. (Not sure if this step is necessary).\n\n*Reinstall rEFInd (or, if you insist, rEFIt) the usual way.\n\n*Next time you boot, you'll get rEFInd.\n\n\nA: I solved this for my friend with the same or a similar problem (Refind was over-ridden by Grub without me being consulted after installing Ubuntu). \nI had a Mountain Lion USB stick made by dd-ing an ISO to a USB stick.\nAfter pressing the on button I used the alt key on a USB PC keyboard, and a boot screen showed.\nI went to the menu to reboot into the Mac mode, this bypasses the grub problem.\nOnce logged into the original OS X system, I reinstalled Refind by opening the Terminal and dragging the Refind install.sh file into the Terminal, hitting enter and entering the sudo password.\nI rebooted and was greeted by Refind again :)\n\nA: You could probably also use efibootmgr or another EFI tool from Ubuntu to tell the UEFI to load rEFIt/rEFInd first. There is some documentation on the rEFInd pages about removing Grub to prevent re-occurrences of this issue (which I've run into myself).\n", "Q: Unable to delete custom colors under Appearance/Background The \"Background\" panel in \"System Settings/Appearance\", allows to select the background color of the desktop, solid or with a gradient.\nThere, the \"Pick a color\" window allows to choice a color from a standard palette, or a custom color.\nWhenever you select a custom color, a corresponding sample is shown under the standard palette.\nIt happens, however, that there is no obvious way to delete a custom color, so the line of samples grows accordingly.\nSo there is a problem when you want to delete a number of custom colors.\nThe data of these colors, which are associated with the user, are supposedly in the home directory, but I've not find any reference to them.\nCan you suggest me  where to look?\n\nA: The right answer is actually the same given to the question I want to delete colors added in Terminal, where it is suggested to install the configuration editor dconf-tools,\nthen execute dconf-editor, expand the tree org/gtk/settings/color-chooser/ and delete the values of the custom-colors key.\n", "Q: Inexpensive way to get Ubuntu LTS with 100% certainty that it has not been compromised I need an Ubuntu installation that I can be 100% certain has no root kits etc.  Unfortunately, buying the CDs on the Ubuntu store would cost me roughly $25 plus shipping and handling (pretty steep for a free OS).\nBut if I download it to my desktop, I can't be 100% sure that it will not be compromised because I can't be 100% sure that my desktop is not compromised (I'm roughly 95% sure my desktop is clean).\nAm I overlooking an obvious way to achieve this result?\n(It seems to me there should be a way to buy a single LTS CD for a couple dollars so that people can start fresh with an installation they know is uncompromised.)\n\nA: md5sum\nThe cheapest way with a 100% guarantee that the ISO you've downloaded is not compromised is by running a md5sum on the ISO AND running a similar routine on the burnt CD.\n\nThe program md5sum is designed to verify data integrity using the MD5\n(Message-Digest algorithm 5) 128-bit cryptographic hash.

About 2 weeks ago I began messing around with Unity Tweak and so no issues. Today, when I go to minimize an application (Happens to any application, regardless of minimized or windowed), it freezes halfway during its minimization. The application's window is translucent and the computer will not respond UNLESS I press the eject button on my keyboard (I randomly pressed it to see if it would respond to it). Once I press the eject button, the window minimizes and I get control again. I have removed Unity Tweak and I am still getting issues. It doesn't necessarily hinder the system, its just REALLY annoying. \n\nA: I had the exact same problem, I have an HP DV4 laptop i5 4Gb and I recently installed Ubuntu and did all the updates and upgrades necessary to get to the 13.04 version I wanted to experience more and installed Unity Tweak Tool, I played with it a bit and when I thought I had set everything according to my preferences, Pain came to my brain!!! everytime I wanted to minimize a window the computer started to run slow and the fans went to max speed, I could only close the windows by pressing constantly ALT+F4, I even forced laptop to turn off by pressing the Power Button and when the laptop restated The login box never disappeared and the wallpaper wouldn't change either, right click on the desk and the contextual menu would't show, Anyway...\nI opened the Unity Tweak Tool again and started to try the controls one by one and BINGO!!! the problem is in the SYSTEM section, DESKTOP ICONS and ICONS ON DESKTOP.\nFor some reason if you switch off the icons, everything goes down, so my suggestion is, reinstall the Unity Tweak Tool and go for the ICONS ON DESKTOP option, everything should go back to normal right after you do that. \n", "Q: Wireless not Working on Dell Latitude D430 I have recently installed version 12.04 LTS on a Dell Latitude D430.

The ballooning is caused by running processes that keep the error file open and dumping data into it, i.e., PID from several different applications e.g., chromium being the largest culprit. I suspect this is the case because lsof | grep deleted returns lines like:\nchromium- 27607  user  2w  REG 8,1 1809493864448  108527952 /home/user/.xsession-errors (deleted)\nchromium- 27762  user  2w  REG 8,1 1809493864448  108527952 /home/user/.xsession-errors (deleted)\n\nThe twist here is that I have a cron job set to delete the file home/user/.xsession-errors` as per a suggested work around to this issue.

I appreciate any suggestions as to how to deal with the run away xsession-errors file once and for all! Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You might be able to access the file through ls -l /proc/<PID>/fd/* (dangerous) and once you've determined the fd number, truncate it with truncate /proc/<PID>/fd/<fd> --size 0 (even more dangerous). That's the alternative to rebooting or killing the process. However it's hard to tell what will happen on subsequent writes to such a mutilated file.\nWhat you really should do is find out what is writing to that file and why and take whatever steps necessary to stop it from doing that. Even ignoring storage issues, writing debug logs is expensive and hurts performance. Thus you should find the root cause.\n", "Q: Problems running Ubuntu from USB drive I just bought new computer hardware and I wanted to install Ubuntu fresh. I downloaded the latest 12.04 LTS .iso file and created a bootable USB stick (4 gb). I then selected 'install ubuntu' from the grub menu and proceeded to install Ubuntu onto a different 32 Gb flash drive. I partitioned the drive into 8 gb ext4 from /, 8 gb swap area, and the remainder on to ext4 /home. I did opt to select installing proprietary drivers. After what seemed like forever (probably 3-4 hrs but I fell asleep) the installation finally completed and I selected the 'restart now' button the next morning when I woke up. In the bios, I then switched to the 32 gb stick as my primary boot device and I don't get a grub menu upon startup, I get a single line error message like problem running operating system, but I can't remember the exact error message and I don't have access to the computer at the moment. I don't think the error message was \"missing operating system\" though. If I boot from the 4 gb flash drive I get the same thing as I got before before installing (I get a menu option to install ubuntu). What did I do wrong? Is booting from usb stick a bad idea? Why did it take so long to install? Mainly looking for a fix to the problem.\n\nA: As for the install taking long, many USB sticks are simply one thing: slow. As for 8GB swap on USB, if that's ever used for anything it'll be even slower. It's better to have no swap at all if it's a slow USB media. Also ext4 (journaling in general) may be the wrong choice for USB, it requires extra write cycles (again, slow) and may considerably reduce the lifetime of the USB stick. I'd go with ext2 even if it means a wait time in case of fsck.\nInstalling on and booting from USB should work fine otherwise. Maybe Grub detected a wrong drive order; the device that's used for booting will usually be the first, i.e. what Grub sees as (hd0). In such a case you might have to install Grub manually (chroot after install, adapt the device.map, grub-install /dev/yourstick). But even so, Grub should at least show up and print an error message or something when you try to boot from the stick.\nIf the box has a CD drive, booting from CD might help avoid confusion regarding drive order for two USB sticks. Or any other way to get rid of the installation media stick before install (BootToRam or similar - sorry I'm not up to date if current install media offer such a feature).\n\nA: ,If I recall right this is a message you get trying to boot a 32bit *buntu on an UEFI computer.\nYou can either use a 64bit *buntu or switch to Legacy mode in BIOS from UEFI.\n", "Q: Install PyMC on Amazon EC2 I want to use PyMC on Amazon EC2. According to my package search the python-pymc package is only available under raring. However, EC2 seems to be shipped with precise and after running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade it seems to have remained precise.\nWhat can I do to install PyMC?\n\nA: First up, dist-upgrade does not change the version of Ubuntu - it's just a modified upgrade task that will add and remove packages if required (upgrade won't). If you want to move to a newer release look at do-release-upgrade.\nSecond, and more relevantly, if you're using a Python stack, and you depend on having certain versions of parts of that stack, after years of testing I would strongly recommend using pip and virtualenv to containerise your whole Python environment.\nIt's a bit more learning but a lot less stress when the underlying Ubuntu does change.\nInstalling PyMC in a virtualenv is a bit more than a pip install but not much more:\nsudo apt-get install ipython python-dev gfortran libatlas-base-dev build-essential\n# activate your virtualenv now\npip install matplotlib scipy numpy networkx nose pymc\n\nNote this is just one of a hundred million different ways of installing this manually.

I was wondering if Ubuntu comes with a file that lists all of the words in, say, the Webster's dictionary, for the purposes of spell checking and whatnot. \nI looked around a bit and I couldn't find anything.\n\nA: The package wamerican has a word list for American English (installed in /usr/share/dict/american-english).

In iTunes this was done through the \"Get Info\" menu but I don't see any way to do this in the aforementioned programs.  How can I do this with Ubuntu?  \n\nA: You probably will have to use iTunes to use this specific feature for an iPod.

If you are connected to internet during Ubuntu (or any of its variants) installer, you have the option \"Download updates while installing\". \n\nBut even if you check this option, there are updates pending when you boot on your fresh installed system. So my question is, what is the reasoning to decide which packages can be updated during installation and which packages can not?\n\nA: The option only DOWNLOADS the updates.  It does not install them.  I never check the option because I don't find that it always works. Also, why not just do it after the install because then you can start customizing the system during the updates.\nAnd the other option to install multimedia codecs is VERY helpful because then you can do most multimedia stuff without having to install other codecs.\n\nA: The \"Download updates while installing\" tickbox is somewhat of a misnomer. As you can see from the description below it, this tickbox only downloads a few packages in order to enable flash and mp3 etc to function.\n\nA: That option asks if you want to install closed source third-party software for MP3 playback and Flash. I would strongly suggest that you check this option.   \nAlso, I think that it downloads files that are needed for the installer, in-case there are updates available since the ISO was made, to make the installation go smooth.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 Bluetooth Adapter Identified but Cannot Detect Devices Alright, so a little back story before the question.

I find that some devices can't be detected, or can't be paired. \nFor any hardware device, often times some functions of a device don't work, while others do.\nOne thing I like about Linux is that certain devices that don't work Windows do actually work in Linux.

Then start up your applications and see if the same issue happens. If not, then copy your documents over into the new user account and use that account instead of your old one.\nIf the problem isn't localised to your user account, try booting Ubuntu off a livecd or USB stick.

If that's the case then one sure fire way to fix the problem is the reinstall Ubuntu. \nI'd use the 13.04 live disc though, as there's not much point reinstalling an old OS version, unless there's a particular issue with the new version that you need to avoid.\n", "Q: How to fix messed up GUI when Installing Ubuntu 13.04 I tried downloading the 32 bit version of Ubuntu 13.04, and when it finished, I used the universal USB installer tool, provided on the ubuntu website. That was all successful, but when I tried to boot it, the GUI was completely messed up. It loaded the system itself, but once it went into the desktop with the dialog prompting for a language for installation, the screen went whacko. Every other Horizontal line of pixels was messed up, and it had columns (kind of) that repeated what the screen should look like, but only a small region of it.\nMy Processor is AMD 64 bit, so I tried again with the 64 bit version of Ubuntu, but the exact same thing happened. (By the way, I have slow internet, so each download took about 4-5 hours, along with several failed downloads.) I tried the same thing using a different usb mounting software, but the same GUI issue happened. Each time I retried, I completely wiped and re-formatted the USB disk. Nothing is working. What should I do? Should I download the Windows Installer? Use a CD? Please help! Any feedback is appreciated.\n\nA: From your description this sounds like a graphics card issue. The boot menu where you select the language would be 'grub' which is a software that Ubuntu uses to boot into the main OS. (Grub v2.something to be more specific)\nGrub loads using the Linux VESA driver, which is compatible with a very wide range of graphics cards. \nBut I suppose it is possible that it's not compatible with yours.\nIf that's the case, then the best thing to do would be to get Ubuntu to boot off the USB stick into the \"Live session\".\nThe live session is when Linux boots pre-install. It will at that point load the open source drivers for your graphics card. Which hopefully will work better than the VESA drivers... Quite likely not though, but it's worth a shot.\nNormally, if you don't press a key as the Ubuntu USB stick boots, it would automatically select English as the default language and boot into the live session.\nOr if that's not the case (some of the USB stick creators put on their own grub menus), then you can see if it's possible to navigate the grub menu to select your language and then select \"try ubuntu without installing\" or some such, which is the default boot mode and will boot a live session.\nIt might also help to search the model of your graphics card/ chip and see if other Linux users have been having the same issue, and what their solutions were.\n", "Q: ubuntu USB wont save my setting on reboot despite my 2gb persistent partition Ive install Ubuntu 13.0.4 onto a new 8gb USB drive with the windows universal installer.\nI told it to format the drive and leave a 2gb persistent space.\nIt all seemed to work.\nOn boot I select try ubuntu form usb.

I joined the world of linux a year ago, finally giving Windows the finger, running Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop.\nA month ago I set up a home server running Ubuntu Server 12.04 headless. The primary purpose is for serving media (samba server) but I am also running a torrent and web server on it amongst other things. It doesnt run 24-7, just when its needed. The server is connected to the home wireless network.\nI also installed OpenELEC (lightweight linux distro for XBMC) on a RaspberryPi which serves as the media center for the living room TV. The Pi contains no media at all and is connected to the home server via ethernet, sharing the home servers internet/wlan connection through static routes and some UFW rules. The ethernet connection direct from the server ensures fast streaming of HD videos etc to the Pi.\nSince the home server sits right next to the TV anyway, would it be better/more efficient to run the media center on Ubuntu Server in a VirtualBox VM? The home server has a decent graphics card that is going to waste (headless) and this method would mean OpenELEC is only running while the server is switched on, the rest of the time, its useless anyway.\nWhich way is more energy efficient? Moving the media centre to a VM on Ubuntu server would mean only 1 machine is running but the Pi uses very little power and the server load would increase running a VM. Also would this setup improve the media centers internet/home network connection, which doesnt seem to be great at the moment?\nAn alternative architecture is installing VMWare ESXi and running Ubuntu Server and OpenELEC as 2 different VMs with access to the disc drive partition that contains all of the media. At work Im currently moving some of our customers systems to the ESXi architecture and it seems nice and efficient and minimal but it seems to have a long boot  time (at least the free version does) which means I would lose Ubuntu's ridiculously quick boot time. As its not running 24-7 maybe the power of ESXi is only realised on a commercial scale and isnt suitable for a home setup?\nLook forward to your response.\nCheers,\nClive\n\nA: If your file server is powerful enough just run any recent version of Ubuntu and install XBMC over the top and set it to start up when it automatically logs in. OpenElec while it is nice and lean it has zero to little ability for command line or background configuration (doesn't even have access to apt-get)\n", "Q: Display settings fail to apply on 13.04 with Gnome 3.6/3.8 When running the Display settings (gnome-control-center display) under Gnome 3.6 on Ubuntu 13.04 I'm unable to apply any settings (even if nothing changes).

If possible, also disable FastBoot and IntelSRT.\n\n*Reduce your Windows partition via Windows tools\n\n*Install Ubuntu 64bit via the \"Something else\" option (screenshot). For example if you have 100GB free space, you will fill it with a 2GB SWAP partition and a 98GB root partition. See this page for more info.\n\n*Reboot your PC and check if you can access both Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n*If needed, use Boot-Repair to make the GRUB menu boot both Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n\nIf you cannot disable SecureBoot at step 1, then follow those 3 steps instead of the 5 above:\n\n\n*\n\n*backup your data\n\n*disable UEFI in your BIOS\n\n*format your disk, then reinstall Windows (it will install in Legacy mode), then install Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: The symptom described (Ubuntu's installer claiming the disk is empty when in fact it's not) is usually caused by one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leftover software RAID data on a disk that's no longer being used in a RAID array. This can usually be fixed by typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda (or whatever the device name is). You should be positive that you're not actually using RAID before you do this, though; sometimes even single-disk computers have RAID active.\n\n*A damaged partition table. Frequently my FixParts can fix this problem, but sometimes you must do something else. Precisely what else depends on the nature of the damage.\n\n\nMy suspicion is that you've actually installed Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy boot mode, which has caused it to install an MBR partition table without completely wiping an older GUID Partition Table (GPT) from the disk. This will cause precisely the symptoms you report. If I'm right, FixParts will fix the problem; but then you must be careful to install Linux in BIOS mode rather than in EFI mode.\n", "Q: BSNL 3G Data Card is installed in Ubuntu 12.04, but not opening I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed in my laptop.\nBSNL 3G Data Card software installed, but not opening.\nWhat are the possible problems.\n\nA: I had similar issue with MTNL 3G Jadoo data card (Teracom LW272) and resolved it as described here:\nUsing \"MTNL 3G Jadoo\" data card on Ubuntu.\nMight help you too.\n", "Q: Change UDP port with iptables for VPN clients What I want to do is say that for all UDP connections on interface ppp0 that have a destination port of 53, change that destination port to 1053.\nI am attempting to change the destination port of UDP packets for VPN clients connected via PPTP on Ubuntu.\nThis question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/242772/using-iptables-to-change-a-destination-port\nsuggests that this can be done using NAT at the --to-destination option, for example:\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination x.x.x.x:1053\n\nThis does work but it changes the port for ALL packets going out on port 53 but I only want to chane the port for some of my VPN clients who are connected on interface ppp0-255 and IP range 192.168.0.10-255.\nI have tried adding the source into the statement, for example:\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -s 192.168.0.10 -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination x.x.x.x:1053\n\nThis however does not appear to work and the VPN connections still go through to port 53.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Try the following rule:\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ppp+ -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1053\nI have not tried it but it should work.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu Splash Screen Customization I wanted to know how to customize the splash screen in Ubuntu 13.

Given this appears to be reproducible I'm posting this in the hope that others will not suffer the PITA that is rebooting a remote server.\nsudo init 6 should work too, but this would skip the user warnings. \n\nA: There was a syntax change between 12.10 and 13.04:\nreboot [OPTION]...                          # 12.10\nreboot [OPTION]...  [REBOOTCOMMAND]         # 13.04 and later\n\nSo to put it mildly, your now was never \"valid\", it was just ignored.\nNow, the now is being read in as REBOOTCOMMAND and that's being used during the reboot sequence and that's generally why everything's getting so fouled up.\nThe short solution is you just don't need now. You never have. That's the shutdown command.\n\nA: I know the question is old but I run into this myself after installing 14.04 and noticed that the now keyword seems to confuse the reboot command.\nThe command to use nowadays is simply\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: You can shutdown or restart your desktop or server with a simple command in bash.

You have two options. Boot up with windows and shut it down normally, but this seems no be impossible since Windows is not working.\nYou could also try to force a recheck of that partition:\nsudo fsck /dev/sda3 \n\nAfter that, restart the system. You should be able to access the partition under Ubuntu. And maybe you can also boot Windows (but that depends of which problem your Windows installation has).\n\nA: one time i was getting this error for my linux system due to problem during booting a system. This probably get affected because the windows might not properly shutted down, due to which each partition got locked by windows filesystem. I tried doing properly shutting down the windows system, but it didn't work completely. Then i came across two working commands\n$ sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdaXY\n\nThen to mount the disk in read/write mode\n$ sudo mount -o rw /dev/sdaXY\n\nwhere XY is your partisan id like sda1, sda2...n.\n$ man ntfsfix\n\n\nntfsfix  is  a  utility  that fixes some common NTFS problems. \n  ntfsfix is NOT a Linux version of chkdsk.  It only repairs some\n  fundamental. NTFS inconsistencies, resets the NTFS journal file and\n  schedules an NTFS consistency check for the first boot into Windows.\n  You may run ntfsfix on an NTFS volume if you think it was damaged by\n  Windows or some other way and it cannot be mounted.\n\n\nA: You can change /etc/fstab file and append ,ro to the mount options for the NTFS drive. Mount the drive. Now you can remove the hibernation file like so sudo ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sdb1 /path to mount point Make sure /dev/sdb1 is the actual device on your system.

Cold-boot to login-prompt GUI takes minutes, compared to about 15 seconds on Windows 7 and less than a minute on the Macmini. Starting a terminal window by ctrl-alt-t takes perhaps 20 seconds, and even editing a command line has significant delays.\nQuestion: How do I solve this performance problem?\nI have installed Ubuntu 13.04 (64 bit) on an Acer Aspire 8951G on the 120 GB SSD in ext4 format, with a 32 GB swap on an HDD.\nThen, coming from a Windows environment, I started by doing an update: sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade.

At a certain point, more swap RAM slows down the computer considerably. Maybe try keeping the RAM+swap to a reasonable level (not 64GB), except if you really need it.\nA good alternative would be to change the swappiness (how much the computer uses SWAP) to a lower level. The following command checks your swappiness.\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nSwappiness is default at 60, meaning it will use your slower hard drive instead of your faster RAM a lot of the time.\nYou can modify the swappiness with the next command, you will have to try around with the value a bit, maybe even set it to 0 (having 32GB of RAM is plenty):\nsudo sysctl vm.swappiness=[enter value here]\n\nHowever this works only for the current session. To change the swappiness on startup (when it really matters), you will have to edit a config file\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nFind the vm.swappiness line; if none exists, add it.\nvm.swappiness = [enter value here]\n\nTo use the settings without rebooting, toggle swapping\n  sudo swapoff -a; sudo swapon -a\n\nsource: http://www.n00bsonubuntu.net/content/change-swappiness-settings/\n\nA: For the SSD make sure its firmware is up to date. Also check and see if you can get a driver for the nVidia card, sometimes that makes all the difference in the world. \nYou can also run an alignment tool in Windows to make sure the SSD is properly aligned.\nIf you disable journaling for EXT4 that can help improve speed as that's been the cause for issues with SSDs and Ubuntu 12.10 in the past.\nTo disable journaling for ext4 do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount the filesystem, you may need to do this from a bootable DVD or USB drive (preferred)\n\n*Run the following in a terminal windows: tune4fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sda1\n\n*Run from terminal: e4fsck –f /dev/sda1\nJust reboot afterwards. NOTE: DISABLING JOURNALING CAN CAUSE DATA LOSS IN AN EVENT OF A POWER OUTAGE!\n\nA: You might also want to delete the partition completely using gparted (using puppy linux of which most if not all have gparted, or use gparted live pendrive/cd or using the live UBUNTU CD if you have an internet connection and install gparted) and recreate it, making sure that \"align to MB\" is chosen and create an EXT4 partition in the empty space.\nIt is possible that the installer did not align the partition to MB as what happened to me and the machine was deadly slow.

This is often caused by GRUB/GRUB2 (the bootloader that allows you to choose which OS to load) not being installed in the Master Boot Record (the place that tells the BIOS what to boot).\nThe fix usually is pretty simple, there are two relatively easy options (taken from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nGetting Boot-Repair\n1st option : get a CD including Boot-Repair\nThe easiest way to use Boot-Repair is to burn one of the following disks and boot on it.\nBoot-Repair-Disk is a CD starting Boot-Repair automatically.\nBoot-Repair is also included in Linux-Secure-Remix. \nRemark : you can also install the ISO on a live-USB (eg via UnetBootin or LiliUSB or Universal USB Installer).\n2nd option : install Boot-Repair in Ubuntu\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*boot your computer on a Ubuntu live-CD or live-USB.\n  \n*choose \"Try Ubuntu\"\n  \n*connect internet\n  \n*open a new Terminal, then type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get\n  update\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Press Enter.\n  \n*Then type:\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Press Enter\n  \n\nThen, once it's installed, do the following:\n\nRecommended repair\nlaunch Boot-Repair from either :\nthe Dash\n(the Ubuntu logo at the top-left of the screen)\nor\nSystem->Administration->Boot-Repair menu (Ubuntu 10.04 only)\nor\nby typing boot-repair in a terminal \nThen click the \"Recommended repair\" button. When repair is finished, note the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXX) that appeared on a\n  paper, then reboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs.\n  If the repair did not succeed, indicate the URL to people who help you by email or forum.\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu onto a Mac Mini? I've been trying to install Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04 and 13.10 onto my mac mini using every tutorial I could find using dd or even a program similar to UNetbootin  for mac, and nothing seems to be working. \nI only have the mac option for now so I'm not able to make a bootable USB on windows and every time I try to boot it says isolinux.bin missing or corrupted (except with the other program i don't recall what that error was, it was an early attempt.) \nI've now been trying for three weeks and and I have downloaded each Ubuntu many times and checked everyone of then and even installed them in VirtualBox. I'm currently trying to install windows 7 into VirtualBox to start trying from windows, so I'll respond when I do, but why has every attempt of mine failed after checking and rechecking to make sure I do it right, made sure I was dd to the disk and not the partition. Any ideas?\nMy cdrom doesn't work (kind of) also. It doesn't accept any types of cds besides blanks. so unfortunatly I can't even completely format a new copy of mac without downloading an image from the internet and copying it to a pen drive also. I do have refit, or actually refind which is a continuation of refit because refit isn't maintained anymore. And when I boot and select my flash drive to boot from that's when the screen flashes like any normal boot and throws the error. also I have tried refit. – user162727 24 mins ago \nthe mac is from 2009, I've even tried installing ubuntu into virtual box and used dd to copy it to the flash drive, also made a backup image via dd of the virtual machine and tried restoring it to my second partition and neither of the two options have worked. giving the same or simalar error.\nP.S. I'm only posting this because I've already searched this database and tried everything that I could find and nothing worked.\n\nA: This question is old but it seems to be viewed a lot so thought i'd post this for anyone who happens across this..\nThis is for installing Ubuntu 13.10 on mac as the main OS (no refit or refind or dual boots) from an external usb drive, using OSX to prepare the media.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create two partitions on an external usb drive via Disk Utility.  Format them both MS-DOS and name the first BOOT and the second UBUNTU.\n\n*Extract the contents of the Ubuntu ISO that you have downloaded.  You can use a free program called Keka \n\n*Copy (drag and drop) the content of the extracted ISO to your BOOT partition\n\n*Use this Ubuntu guide for using dd to create a live disk on your UBUNTU partition.\n\n*Reboot and hold down the option key, select EFI Boot and then Install Ubuntu\nEssentially all we are doing is creating a partition for you mac to boot from and launch the installer and then a second live media partition that the installer will recognise and use to complete the install.\n\nA: I had the same sort of problems with the Ubuntu installation and configuration process on Macs (Mac mini to be specific here). I fixed most of the issues I experienced, such as Wireless connectivity and power management, and made a little guide so anyone who is interested can read and comment on it if you got questions...\nhttp://theredblacktree.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/installation-guide-for-linux-mint-15-ubuntu-13-04-on-apple-mac-mini-late-2012/\nUpdate: for Ubuntu 14.04\nhttps://theredblacktree.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/installation-guide-for-linux-mint-17-ubuntu-14-04-on-apple-mac-mini-late-2012/\n\nA: I have my Mac Mini up and running the best option is always to install REFIT first. It takes care of all of the oddities of booting up an external USB or CD ROM.\nhttp://refit.sourceforge.net/\nWhen you install refit make sure you reboot twice. Then on the second reboot it will display multiple options to boot. Either your OSX or any external devices it sees.\nIf however you want to replace OSX totally, which I don't recommend, its best to do it with the external DVD.\nI installed 12.04 which works very well.\nAfter thought...\nI found that when I installed Ubuntu on my MacBook Air there was nothing I could do except buy and external drive and load it that way. Seems Apple have \"dongled\" the firmware to such an extent that that was the only way. Might be time to get that external drive or fix existing one ;) \n", "Q: How can I tell if my laptop has Bluetooth?

I'd love to get more use out of the Dash files/music/video/photos lenses, but all of my documents and media are on (CIFS) network shares. These shares are always mounted and the files always available, but I don't see the results I should when I run file-related searches on the Dash. Sample searches do return the relevant files if I copy them into my desktop or elsewhere on the local system, so I know it's not an issue with Dash not being able to parse the files.\nIs this something that can be enabled via a setting tweak/change? Some way to let Unity/Dash know it's okay to search/index network shares? Should it already be doing this out of the box and it's just not working on my particular setup?\n\nA: Fixed my own problem (+1 to my \"Linux user\" cred!):\nUnity does attempt to find files you search for via the Dash, but the default configuration for the file indexing tool it uses behind the scenes (\"locate\") blacklists a bunch of directories and filesystem types. What you want to do is edit your /etc/updatedb.conf file and remove some of these exclusions.\nFor my particular use case, I removed \"/media\" from the PRUNEPATHS directive and \"nfs\"/\"cifs\" from the PRUNEFS directive.

Is this possible, or am I going to have to stick with exporting multiple sizes of an image?\nI know GIMP can read SVGs, but can it export them?\n\nA: If you need to convert a raster image to a vector image autotrace is a command line tool which does exactly that. \nIt's available as a debian package on Debian and Ubuntu named autotrace\nAn example of using it is:\nautotrace input.jpg --output-file output.svg --output-format svg\n\nUpdate: \nI've also had success with potrace where autotrace was having trouble.\n\nA: Even though Gimp is not a vector program, you can actually export single paths as SVG file with the Export Path menu item. \nHere is a photo tutorial that explains in detail how to do it. \n\nA: GIMP v2.8 does not natively export bitmaps to SVG files. There used to be a plugin to do so but this project apparently is discontinued. We could import an image as a bitmap object to Inkscape  and save it as an SVG file. The image will then remain a bitmap file, i.e. it will get aliasing artifacts on scaling (see below).\nBut Inkscape can do even more. We can import the bitmaps we had already put so much work in to Inkscape and convert them with a few mouse clicks to nice vector graphics.\nHere is how to do that:\n\n*\n\n*Open Inkscape.\n\n\n*Choose \"File - Import\" to import a bitmap file.\n\n\n*Choose to \"embed\" the image.\n\n\n*Select the image with the select tool (↖).\n\n\n*Select Path - Trace Bitmap... for settings (below shown for 2 colors = \"Scans\" ):\n\n\n\n*Select \"Update\" for a preview until settings are fine.\n\n\n*Start tracing with \"OK\".\nNow a vectorized image of your original bitmap will be seen on top of the bitmap. We can resize or move this newly created object, delete the original image, or choose to \"Object - Ungroup\" in case we need to adapt shapes or colour of sub-object created.\n\n\n*If necessary, reduce size of the vectorized image (hold down CTRL to lock ratio), so that it fits on the page.  Otherwise it may appear \"cropped\" when viewed.\n\n*Use \"File - Save As\" to save your file in SVG format.\n\nThe advantage of a vector graphic can most rapidly be seen when we increase its size. Shown below was zooming to 2500%. Top is the original bitmap, bottom is the vectorized object:\n\nThis image and object was created from your original from chat\n\nA: GIMP is a raster graphics editor application. SVG is a form of vector graphics. If you want to edit SVG files, you should install the inkscape package and use Inkscape instead. Also, beware that SVG is not totally \"scalable\" in the sense that you will get a good image at every size you scale to, so depending on what you are creating with it, you may need to draw different sizes of the image, with different amounts of detail, so that the images will look good at those sizes. Icons for an application, for example, do need to be drawn at multiple sizes, whether they are drawn as raster or vector images.\n\nA: potrace is the tool for that. You can process them bulk, but first you have to convert the images to monochrome:\nls ./p*.jpg | xargs -L1 -I {}  convert -monochrome {} {}.bmp\nls -1 ./*.bmp | xargs -L1 -I {} potrace {} -r 300 -b svg -o {}.svg\n\ninstall: \nsudo apt install potrace\n\n\nA: Well, actually, you can save SVGs with GIMP. For instance, you can use this command: (gimp-vectors-export-to-file 1 \"new.svg\" 0)\n", "Q: resolving windows hostname my main host is windows and im running ubuntu on a virtual guest OS, im currently mounting a folder in windows and in ubuntu and i get this error:\nin /etc/fstab\n//Windows-PC/shared /home/user/shared`\n----------------------------------------\nmount -a\nmount error: could not resolve address for Windows-PC: Unknown error\n\nhow do i resolve a windows hostname in ubuntu?\n\nA: Install the following package:\nsudo apt-get install winbind\nEdit the file /etc/nsswitch.conf and add wins to the line\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n-->\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal wins [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\nNow you should be able to ping your windows hosts using the netbios name.\n", "Q: How to open the additional drivers window using command line How can I launch the additional drivers window from the command line?\n\nA: In a terminal, enter the following command:\nsoftware-properties-gtk --open-tab=4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*0 = Ubuntu Software \n\n*1 = Other Software \n\n*2 = Updates \n\n*3 = Authentication\n\n*4 = Additional Drivers\n\n\nA: The additional drivers window is now incorporated in the Software & Updates application in Ubuntu 13.04\nIt can be launched from the command line (gnome-terminal).

A brief search doesn't turn up any existing implementation of this idea (or at least, not one that is part of the standard Ubuntu set-up - I wouldn't be surprised if someone, somewhere had done it).\nThis message implies it would be possible to change the user during the authentication process, and one could presumably therefore write a PAM module which checked multiple passwords and switched the finally logged-in user appropriately. However, you'll need to do some pretty difficult development work yourself.\nIf your intention is to create a \"hidden\" user you'll need to do quite a lot more work to hide the existence of the hidden user beyond just playing with the login sequence - changing where their $HOME is stored, what goes in the auth log, hiding the fact that a system check would show the login sequence was modified, etc, etc.\n", "Q: Block all non-squid traffic for PPTP users I have squid running on a transparent proxy (port 3128) and VPN clients connecting + ip forwarding via PPTPD.

But psusi's comment does:\n\nSquare peg, round hole. apt-get install downloads and installs a\n  package from the Ubuntu software repository, it does nothing with a\n  local file, let alone one that is a Windows executable file.\n\nTo expand on this, apt-get provides functionality that doesn't correspond to anything in Windows. In Ubuntu, the most commonly used and highly recommended way to install software is by using the built-in package management system to automatically download it and install it. This keeps it updated as well--when you run the Software Updater, it updates everything installed in this way.\nOne good way to look at package management in Ubuntu is that it has two layers:\nThe package manager itself (dpkg)\nThe dpkg utility and the database it uses and maintains performs the actual install, remove, and update operations (including running installation and removal scripts included in the packages) and keeps track of what packages are installed in what versions and what dependencies exist between packages.\nYou can run dpkg on a file on your computer, but it has to be a .deb package file. If you manually downloaded such a file (suppose it were called foo.deb), you could install it with dpkg by running:\nsudo dpkg -i foo.deb\n\nThere are also graphical frontends for dpkg, such as gdebi.\nComparison: dpkg and the Windows Installer\ndpkg actually does correspond to part of Windows: it corresponds to Windows Installer, which consists of an installation utility, a system service, and a database (part of the registry) to keep track of what is installed. There's even a command-line utility for it: msiexec.exe.\nA .msi installer package on Windows corresponds to a .deb package on Ubuntu and the other operating systems (e.g., Debian) that use dpkg.\nAPT, Software Center, Update Manager (and others)\nWe often say APT is the part of Ubuntu's package management system responsible for:\n\n\n*\n\n*knowing what sources (typically but not always, this means online sources) are being used to automatically install software (see man sources.list)\n\n*knowing what software source provided each package that is currently installed, as well as what packages are available from each software source (see man apt-cache)\n\n*installing and upgrading packages by downloading them and the packages they depend on from those software sources and installing them, in the correct order, by calling dpkg behind the scenes (see man apt-get)\n\n\nAPT is part of Ubuntu and it does these things. However, not all tools that do these things are frontends for the programs that are part of APT. For example, the Software Center and Update Manager don't actually call apt-get behind the scenes when they install and upgrade software.\nThey do, however, use the databases and (to an extent) the APT configuration files and log files. And they do their jobs by closely following the rules laid down by APT's developers, so maintain compatibility. (There's another command-line alternative to the APT tools as well, called aptitude. It also does not call apt-get or other APT tools behind the scenes, but behaves much like them.)\nUnlike dpkg, APT (and the Update Manager / Software Updater and Software Center) do not correspond well to anything on most versions of Windows.\nComparison: Software Center and the Windows Store\nThe Windows Store is much like the Software Center... except that it is not currently usually involved in upgrading core components of Windows (one notable exception is upgrading Windows 8 to 8.1), and on versions of Windows that support desktop apps, it is not used to install and upgrade most software, but only Metro apps.\nIn contrast, on versions of Windows that are Metro-only, like Windows RT, all apps are installed through the Windows Store and it is like the Software Center.\nPartial comparison: Update Manager / Software Updater and Windows/Microsoft Update\nOn Windows, Windows Update will upgrade official parts of Windows when bug fixes and some feature enhancements are released, and Microsoft Update (which can be enabled by the user) will upgrade some other official Microsoft software as well.\nBut most software on Windows is not maintained by these utilities, which is in contrast to the Update Manager / Software Updater on Ubuntu, where even unofficial software can come from software sources that provide updates, and where software from the official repositories is not mostly written or maintained by Canonical.\nTo clarify further why this does not work...\nWith this information, I hope it's clear why sudo apt-get install something.exe will not work: This is like going into the Windows Store and trying to run \"something.exe\" from it. It's the wrong tool for the job.\nSo how to do it?\nLucio's answer explains well how to (attempt to) install a Windows executable on Ubuntu with Wine. If you want to do it from the command line, you can do that too (though the installer will still be graphical):\nwine CreepySetup.0.1.94.exe\n\nDon't use sudo; Wine is designed to work without it (and not designed to work very well if you do use it: you probably wouldn't be able to run the installed software except as root).\n\nA: A .exe file is compatible with a Windows system, but this files are not compatible with Ubuntu. At least in a native way.\nYou can install WINE to install Windows programs. This is a software for running Windows applications in Linux platforms. I should mention that not every Windows program will run correctly with WINE. But you don't loose anything trying.\nThe apt command is not the way to install EXE files, the correct procedure is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Wine\n\n*Open the exe file with Wine doing secondary click on the file and selecting Wine Windows Program Loader\n\nThe rest depends on the setup method of the software. Example:\n\n\nA: Because .EXE files are Windows-only. You need Wine to run them.\n\nA: That's cos you need to install the Ubuntu version. You downloaded the Windows exe.\nIn the terminal..\nAdd creepy's ppa repository with :\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jkakavas/creepy\nUpdate package list\n$ sudo apt-get update\nInstall creepy\n$ sudo apt-get install creepy\n", "Q: Terminal \"find\" command not working Ok, so my terminal was working fine yesterday, but all of a sudden, it decided that no file or directory exists anymore.

After entering the command, press \"Return\" key.\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\n\n*Once completed, open \"Software & Updates\" againand select the tab named \"Additional Drivers\". There, you could choose between a proprietary version of Nvidia and a few xorg devel versions. Choose the one tagged proprietary. It may take some time to finish downloading depending on your connection.\n\n*Once complete download is finished, close the window.\n\n*Voilà, you have installed Nvidia driver.\n\nA: I noticed that you said 400m series. Usually these days laptops come with optimus technology. If you have optimus then you need to install bumblebee.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\nAdd the Stable Bumblebee Releases PPA and install Bumblebee using the proprietary NVIDIA driver:\n  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\nIf you have 32-bit applications like Wine, and run 11.10 Oneiric or later, you will need extra libraries:\n  sudo apt-get install virtualgl-libs:i386\n\nAllow yourself to use Bumblebee by adding yourself to the 'bumblebee' group. (replace $USER by your username)\n  sudo usermod -a -G bumblebee $USER\n\nReboot or re-login to apply the group changes\nIf you'd like to run a program on the nvidia card now, use the optirun program:\n  optirun firefox &\n\n\nA: I found a very good tutorial online, and I was able to install those infamous Nvidia drivers on two computers without a problem. Here is what you do:\nPreparation\n1) First, you need to open up a terminal shell. You can either start up your computer and go to a virtual shell\nCtrl+Alt+F1\nor login and open up the gnome terminal\nCtrl+Alt+t\n2) Then In the terminal, run the following commands:\nThis command will refresh your packages\n sudo apt-get update\n\nThen you will need to install the linux headers if those are not already installed.\n sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nNext, you will need to do a dist-upgrade, which upgrade some packages of your system\n sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nWhen that is all done, you will need to reboot your system\n sudo reboot\n\nThe Installation of the Drivers\n1) Repeat step one to open the terminal.\nNow install the Nvidia drivers\n sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates \n\nYou have one more step, or else, you will have a high chance that you just soft-bricked your system. For safe measures, run this final command:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\n*There was a well known bug that the Nvidia installation script did not run that command. If that config file is not created, your graphics will not work.   \nNow reboot your system:\n sudo reboot\n\nCongratulations! You should now be using Nvidia Drivers.\nConfirming it Worked\nOne quick way to check is to click on the gear cog at the top\n\nThen click About This Computer\nIn the line that says Graphics, It should say your Graphics driver:\nThis is what mine looks like:\n\nYou can also click on graphics to get more details:\n\nCheers!\nSource: http://falkvinge.net/2013/02/15/how-to-install-nvidia-drivers-in-ubuntu-12-10-quantal/\n\nA: Since most of these answers are outdated... Here is modern way to install the nvidia drivers for Ubuntu (for 14.04 and newer):\nAll you need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the graphics-drivers ppa\n\n*Install the recommended Nvidia driver\n\n*Restart your system\n\n\nso, from a terminal, run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\nsudo reboot\n\nthat's all there is to it!\nnote: if you want to install a specific version of the graphics driver, you can see which drivers are available for your hardware by running: sudo ubuntu-drivers devices, and inspecting the output to see which drivers are supported.  Then just install normally with, for example, sudo apt-get install nvidia-381\n\nA: This has worked for me few times when things go wrong:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-source\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nsudo depmod -a\nsudo modprobe nvidia_current\nsudo restart lightdm\n\n", "Q: Log out from kiosk mode? Condition:\n1 superuser, 1 kiosk-user.\nSuperuser has root access.\nKiosk-user we want to have access to only 2 apps, but not simultaneously.  2 gnome-desktops created for each app.\nScenario:\nKiosk-user logs in with selected desktop and app opens in full screen mode.  Kiosk-user closes app, script forces sleep for X then reopens app.  This is kiosk mode.\nDesired affect:\nKiosk-user closes app which forces log out.  Then superuser has access or Kiosk-user chooses second gnome-desktop for app #2 in kiosk mode.\nPossible? \n\nA: You can configure LightDM sessions by placing desktop files in /usr/share/xsessions.  For example, create file /usr/share/xsessions/app1.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Application 1\nExec=/path/to/app1\n\nLikewise create file /usr/share/xsessions/app2.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Application 2\nExec=/path/to/app2\n\nThese are your two application sessions.\nI assume your super-user would be using the normal Ubuntu desktop session.  I don't think you can configure LightDM to limit access to this session to the admin user, but you should be able to add an X session script that aborts the session startup if the kiosk user tries to access it. Try creating /etc/X11/Xsession.d/00-check-user with the following content:\nif [ \"$LOGNAME\" = \"kiosk\" -a \"$DESKTOP_SESSION\" = \"ubuntu\" ]; then\n    errormsg \"user not allowed to access ubuntu session\"\nfi\n\nYou'll also want to remove unwanted sessions from /usr/share/xsessions as they may not run the full set of Xsession scripts and therefore could provide unwanted access to the kiosk user.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Is there any way to share a pts/x? What I mean is, user A connect via ssh to the box (ubuntu 12.04). Then ssh to another box (Linux/Solaris/etc) and work.\nUser B connects to ubuntu box and can see what user A is doing.\nI know for solaris are utilities called ntd (to open a shared session) and ntio (to join to the previous opened session, you can have read or write access to the opened session).\n\nA: GNU screen can do session sharing with the the multiuser command and the -x flag (personally I've only tried this in single user mode, so some of the below is guesswork). From the manual page, I gather UserA would have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run screen\n\n*ctrl-A\n\n*:multiuser on\n\n*ctrl-A\n\n*:acladd UserB\nThen UserB would have to:\n screen -x UserA/\n\nAnd from then on they would share the screen.

Servers are correct. Is there a log file to see what evolution is doing ? A few days ago, everything still was fine.\nIs there any other logfile, I could check ?\nThanks in advance :-)\n\nA: I don't know about any log file, but there are debug settings you can enable when starting Evolution from the command line. Find the full description here. In your case, you most likely want to debug SMTP, which currently doesn't have its own separate debug setting. Accodring to the linked manual, here's how you could debug that:\nCAMEL_DEBUG=all evolution >& evo_debug.log\n\nThis would first enable full debug in evolution (CAMEL_DEBUG=all), and then start Evolution itself (evolution) -- while redirecting all the debug output to a file (>& evo_debug.log). This way you've got all information stored for later reference in the file evo_debug.log, which will be created in the directory where you executed above statement from. Alternatively, you can of course specify an absolute location for the log:\nCAMEL_DEBUG=all evolution >& ~/evo_debug.log\n\nwould store the log file directly in your home directory, for example.\n", "Q: HomeGenie Installation on Ubuntu 12.04 Server I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask, but it's kind of a cross between HomeGenie setup and integration with Ubuntu, so I hope I can get some good input or at least pointed in the right direction.\nI installed HomeGenie (an open source home automation project) on my server, but I don't quite get the behind the scenes feel I'm looking for. I have to navigate to the HomeGenie directory and run sudo mono HomeGenie.exe to run the program. At this point the program works great for my purposes, however, my terminal is tied up with output from HomeGenie as it is used. If I interrupt (ctrl + c) the program exits.\nI'm looking for a cleaner integration/install. I'd also like to set the program to start on boot. I'm using a headless server, so everything is done via command line.\n\nA: You can run the command not attached to the terminal by entering a & after your command so in this case sudo mono HomeGenie.exe & should work I think.\n\nA: as we solved this in the HomeGenie forum, I'm sharing the solution also here.\nI added a note on Running HomeGenie as a Background Service at the end of Getting Started documentation page:\nhttp://generoso.info/homegenie/gettingstarted.html\n", "Q: mountall problem on RAID I installed Ubuntu Server 12.04 x64 with a software RAID 1 and had to run boot-repair to make the system bootable.

How does installing programs like Steam/Dropbox/Skype work across distros like Mint, eOS, Debian, Fedora, etc. \nOn Steam's site for example it says:\n\nCurrently, Steam for Linux is only supported on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or 12.10 with the Unity, Gnome, or KDE desktop. Additional distributions will be examined for support as time permits. For more information on Steam for Linux, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valve\n\nDo you really have to be running those DEs? Is it assumed that Ubuntu-based OSes like Mint, eOS would work fine? As well as the various Ubuntu flavors? \nOr if you were running Ubuntu and downloaded the Fedora or opensuse download link on the Skype website would it simply not work? \n\nA: All distributions of Linux do not use the same packaging systems and formats. They also do not all use the same build and compilation options for the software they do include. In the case of Skype, the only probably difference between the download links for Fedora, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, or some other Linux, would be in how the files are packaged and installed on the system. There would be no advantage to trying to run a version built for another distribution of Linux, on Ubuntu, nor the reverse.\nThe Steam for Linux statement of support is so that Valve can limit the amount of problems they have to deal with. It's possible to run Steam under a different configuration for sure, but it will not necessarily be supported by them. Claiming to only support specific versions of Ubuntu with a specific environment being used, means that there is a known stable reference configuration to deal with. Supporting any version of Linux with any configuration means that it would have to be tested on all of those configurations, and versions.\n", "Q: Can't connect using PRO/Wireless 3945 ABG card with 12.04LTS I can't connect to Wi-Fi in Ubuntu 12.04 with an Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG card.

I want to hide some files because they just add clutter to my home folder.  I have a folder in there that is called \"bin\" and is for running startup scripts.  I want to have this folder and I'm not sure if adding a . before it will make the scripts not start.  \n\nA: If you add a . , you are changing the name of your ~/bin so it will no longer be in the path. Scripts may or may not work depending on how you call them, and since it isn't in your path anymore, you cannot just type scriptname.sh and expect it to work. You can do it if you change your path to include /home/myusername/.bin\n\nA: Add (or edit) this to ~/.bashrc\nif [ -d $HOME/.bin ]; then\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/.bin\nfi\n\n\nA: As a convention, filenames beginning with a dot are hidden in many, but not all, contexts.  This is done exactly for the same purpose you want - to hide away clutter that isn't intended to be normally viewed or edited by users.\nHowever, adding a dot to the start of a filename (or directory) changes the filename.  It's not like Windows where the filesystem has a built-in \"hidden\" flag; on Linux adding the dot is actually modifying the filename.  Any existing links you had to that filename, or directory, will be broken.  If you refer to the directory in a configuration script somewhere, that script will need to be modified.  If an application is hard-coded to refer to that directory, it won't find it.  If the directory is in your PATH, the new directory won't be unless you add it in again.\n\nA: create a text files, write bin inside it, and name it .hidden\nyour bin file path wont change but it is hidden in file manager\n", "Q: USB WiFi Adapter not working I am a new Ubuntu user.

Also I still have the same problem with my program: it cannot connect to 77.\n\nA: You seem to be a little confused as to what \"listening\" on a port means. In order to listen for incoming connections on a port, an application must explicitly tell the operating system that it is willing to accept connections on that port. As Bert mentioned in his answer, listening on port 77 will (with the default configuration) require root privileges.\nIf you want to create a simple \"test\" server that can be set listen on a specified port and that you can interact with, take a look at the  netcat command . Basically you want to do this:\nsudo nc -l 77\n\nNow try to run your Qt application. You should see \"Hello Server\" displayed in the terminal that is running netcat. If you change the timeout in QTcpSocket::waitForReadyRead() to something large (like 30000, equal to 30 seconds), you can experiment with sending replies back to your application.\nFor example, launch the netcat command again and run your Qt app. After the terminal displays \"Hello Server\", type something into the terminal and press the Return key. Your Qt app should print whatever you typed to the console.\n\nA: If you use authbind to start tomcats then we do not need iptables or any redirecting rules softwares hope this link will be help full.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/685306/377678\n", "Q: If I remove a partition that was there first, does my second partition get access to the whole drive?

(If say more simply - delete everything). Then make one (or some, if you want) NTFS's and install there your Windows from flash drive (You can search in web about it).\nP.S. My English in not very well, so maybe I make many mistakes. I tell you in advance thanks, if you will fix them.\n", "Q: Github and many other website not loading Recently I installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my desktop.  After that, most of the websites don't load in Firefox or Chrome either. I tried to ping those websites with Terminal but ping is fine with Terminal like Github. But, the website doesn't load anymore. I don't know what's the problem and why is that. I've Windows installation too and I can access those websites without problem in Windows.\nThat's why I am here now. Can anyone please help me about this issue? It would be really a great help for me.\n\nA: When using PPoE connection, one common problem is to set correct MTU on the Ethernet connection.\nUse ping command to determine your MTU:\nping -M do -s 1472 freelancer.com\n\nIf the result is (result = \"Frag needed and DF set\") then go with lower number in the ping command:\nping -M do -s 1462 freelancer.com\n\nuntil you get reply to your ping command (result = reply).\nWrite down the Number - this will be your MTU.\nNow set up the new MTU (your Number) on your ethernet connection as in this question:\nHow do I change the MTU value on Ubuntu?\n", "Q: How to run neogeo games I have some old neo geo games' backups which I play when I was a child. Is there any way of playing this on this ubuntu 13.04. \n\nA: There are ancient Neo Geo emulators roaming around. Alongside GnGeo, there is NeoCD/SDL. I've no idea how well that works but it's just as old so it's just as likely to explode.\nThe reason NeoGeo gets no love is because people just use MAME. MAME handles a wide spectrum of consoles and arcade machines. And people tend to favour the original arcade ROMs that NeoGeo games are ports of. UpUbuntu.com has a fairly good tutorial on getting it all set up that I can't beat... But the basics revolve around the mame package. \nWe also have a question about various MAME front-ends:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any UI for MAME?\n\nA: GnGeo is a neo geo emulator for linux. You may try this one.\n\nA: I would give FinalBurn Alpha a try. You can install/use it directly in retroarch:\nhttps://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki/FinalBurn-Alpha\nIt supports Neo-Geo specifically.\nAs noted in another answer most Neo Geo games are ports from arcade games, and you can play the original game i\n\nA: It difficult to find Neo Geo Emulators for Ubuntu but you should try with RetroArch emulator it's usable for all platforms I think so not sure.\n\nA: NeoRAGEx is what you are searching for. The emulator is available for both Windows and Linux.\n", "Q: \"Secure boot not enabled\" while installing Ubuntu 13.04 on Lenovo B570 I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my Lenovo B570 because my Windows screwed up saying it's missing a boot file -- which is the 5th time it's happened to me. When I go to install Ubuntu, the screen is blank until I hit a key, then it sits there for a little while longer, and it shows up with a garbled command prompt screen, and I can't do anything, it just sits there. Before it starts the blankness, it says \"Secure boot not enabled.\"\nCan someone please help me with this?\n\nA: Try to make a bootable usb.

I bought a pretty large external hard drive to backup my computer with and I have used Deja Dup a couple times.\nI noticed I have a directory DDBackup on my external hard drive now.  Can I use my external hard drive to store other things outside of the DDBackup directory?\n\nA: I don't see why not.  Now keep in mind depending on what backup software you have, and the type of backup that you're using, it may not back up those items that are on the same backup drive.\nAlso be careful when deleting anything from that drive, so it won't affect the backed up data.  I would recommend that you create a separate partition for normal day-to-day use.\n\nA: Yes, you can use it for other things.  Any files out of that DDBackup directory will not bother Deja Dup.\n(Truthfully, even putting files inside that directory won't bother Deja Dup, as it only pays attention to its own files.)\n", "Q: Skype 4.2 freezes, force quits, and cannot re-start. Ubuntu 13.04 I have Skype 4.2 on Ubuntu 13.04. Sometimes, Skype randomly freezes. I have to Force Quit it. I try to re-start Skype, its icon on Unity blinks to indicate it's loading. But nothing happens. The background of the icon turns back to transparent. It can't re-start. I have to shutdown my PC and restart Ubuntu, it's very tedious. Is there a way around this so that I don't have to restart my whole PC just to re-start Skype?\n\nA: You can use System Monitor, to kill the Skype process\n\nOr, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo killall skype -s 9\n\n\nA: From this article you can go to this link and get the old 2.2.0 version of skype which is rock solid stable. Some day skype will start making solid code again, but 4.2 has been just awful.\n\nA: Here are steps you can try, in increasing order of desperation. A combo of 1-3 worked for me!\n\n\n*\n\n*logout & reboot.  \n\n*apt-get update & upgrade.  \n\n*apt-get autoremove & install.  \n\n*install missing libraries for 32-bit mode (suggested here).  \n\n*check display alternatives (suggested here).\n\n", "Q: Storage server with NTFS and Linux on old machine We have several old computers at home, and many IDE HDD drives. I would like to make a \"storage server\" from one. SO I want to use its storage as a shared folder. The other computers are Windows 7 / XP. Reqirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Best config: Pentium II, 256 / 384 MB RAM, 200GB+120GB+120GB, with LAN\n\n*no raid is needed\n\n*I would like to format the non-linux partitions as NTFS (so if linux dies, I put the hdd in win computer it can handle)\n\n*Read/write is needed\n\n*I would like to share the partitions root on SMB (so accessible by windows)\n\n*No gui for the \"server\" - only ssh is needed.\n\n\nWhat do you propose for me, with distro / version is good? I am familiar with debian, ubuntu and centos. \nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Lubuntu can be installed on a pentium II with 384 MB RAM.\nUbuntu Server has a recommended minimum of a 300 Mhz processor and 128 MB RAM.\nIf I needed to build a fileSERVER I would go with the obvious and install the headless Ubuntu Server. And would keep it clean, without a Graphic User Interface.\nBoth systems build from the same source.. The Server edition has no GUI so I believe it will always be lighter in use and can put more resources into the job at hand..\nI think Lubuntu is not going to be all that smooth (Got it running on a HP9010 laptop, 1.2 P4 512MB RAM, works reasonably smooth, but it's a good practice in patience)..\n\nA: Your best bet with be to use Lubuntu.  Lubuntu uses the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment, as its default GUI.  It has very lax system requirements.  You can go here to get more information about Lubuntu, and to download it.\n\nA: If you don't need a gui, just download the server iso, install it and apt-get the packages you need. Once you setup ssh you don't even need a monitor. You might want to look into setting up JBOD to join all the HD's into one logical volume. How to set up multiple hard drives as one volume?\nOf course there is always FreeNAS, which is also really easy. Just be sure to install freeNAS to a bootable USB drive because whatever the boot drive size, FreeNAS claims it and you cannot use it for storage.\n", "Q: check as a root if a special path set How do I check as a root if a special path set?

I have several drives on my server mounted separately. They are getting close to full. When I ssh to my server, motd reports disk usage, for example:\n=> /home is using 89.3% of 916.89GB\n\nBut if I run df -h, it reports:\n/dev/sdd1       917G  826G   45G  95% /home\n\nThis happens for all my drives; motd consistently reports lower numbers. It looks likes motd runs landscape-sysinfo to report this information.\nWhy are they different and which is correct?\n\nA: Having a look at the landscape-sysinfo script which lives in /etc/update-motd.d/  it is clear that the calculation of the disk space is being done with cat /proc/partitions rather than the df command. \nPerforming the same test on my machine but using / as an example I get the same results, cat /proc/partitions shows less disk space being used while df shows a bit more disk usage. The method used to calculate the partition size is different hence the different results:\ncat /proc/partitions \nmajor minor  #blocks  name\n   8        5  606765056 sda5\n\ndf\nFilesystem            1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda5             597111968 53985732 512787984  10% /\n\nBoth are correct in their own calculations, I would rely on df to get a better indiciation of disk usage for your /home partition.\n\nA: I filed a bug to track this:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/landscape-client/+bug/1186154\nI believe landscape-sysinfo should be changed to match df.\n", "Q: ~/.pam_environment doesn't work since Ubuntu 13.04 I have this line in my ~/.pam_environment:\nPATH             DEFAULT=${HOME}/bin:${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}\n\nand it worked perfectly well on Ubuntu 12.10, but since I've updated to 13.04 it is completely ignored:\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nAny ideas why?\n\nA: ~/.pam_environment does not use the normal syntax and you should strictly follow the pam_env.conf syntax.\n\nNote: Using .pam_environment requires a re-login in order to initialize the variables.

I sometimes download large files, and when I do I always see this kind of \"heartbeat\" in the speed of the download:\n\nAlthough it doesn't really matter to me, I just wonder what causes this behaviour? Is it Ubuntu itself, or my router, or my ISP or maybe something else?\n[edit] Just to clarify; this happens with any download, whether it be through http, ftp, or even when I'm using torrents..\n\nA: Most likely it is the source server cycling as it pre-caches the next requested segment of the file. The sample you show is actually pretty good in that the download speed remains constant and the dips aren't larger. You might see completely different results if you attempted a download from a very busy server, with bigger dips and even stalls as the server tries to cope with the I/O requests.\n\nA: Another possibility, though certainly not a sure thing, is that you're observing a TCP congestion avoidance algorithm in action. The sending host does not know the full capacity or latency (or current utilization) of the network between you and it ahead of time, so to maximize throughput and minimize data loss, TCP (usually the layer beneath your http, ftp, and torrents) gradually ramps up the amount of data that it sends per millisecond, until finally the connection gets clogged and the sender stops receiving all the acknowledgements it expects, at which point it backs off the rate somewhat and resumes a gradual upward climb again from that lower point. In this interpretation, those periodic \"dips\" would be times when the server has attempted to send more data per second than can get through and then slows down a bit.\nI found a few charts of this in an image search, but they have more of a sawtooth shape rather than your heartbeat. I suppose that could be due to the difference between the perspective of the sender and the receiver, though.\n\nA: Before any conclusions can be made we need to know how this was measured. My gut tells me the heartbeat is a function of the tool you are using to measure the result. In physics they say you cannot look at something without affecting the outcome. So measurements must me made in multiple ways to be sure.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 extremely slow I have installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my desktop ( intel 1.6 GHz dual core processor, 512mb ram) It's a dual boot with xp.\nIts booting time is okay but it is extremely slow while doing normal tasks (like opening firefox or terminal or any other thing).

What packages do I need to re-install or remove?\nEdit: What I noticed now in particular is that the the widget frames and some of the colors look like Kubuntu. For example, the window frames are dark grey and square and don't show shadowing and highlighting the way Unity does. And in Firefox, when I added a new folder to the bookmark toolbar, the folder showed up with a Dolphin style folder icon, not what you seen normally - not similar to the icon ins Nautulis (why do look OK) .

I've followed the instructions found here: How can I access system mail in /var/mail/ via thunderbird?\nI can read mail on the system using alpine or vim, so I know the mailbox is not empty. When I click the get-mail button, nothing happens. I see no Inbox (or any folder structure) for the specific account. I've set the rights for /var/mail to 1777. \nSettings\n\n\n*\n\n*server name: localhost\n\n*username: john\n\n\nHow can I get this working?\n\nOkay, considering the extra bounty, I would like to get this working like normal mail. The accepted answer from Qasim resulted in a much more usable situation than before - opening mail in Thunderbird with layout. I still face three problems though. \n\n\n*\n\n*When new mail is received in the mailbox, Thunderbird won't see this until after I restart Thunderbird. \n\n*When Thunderbird is restarted, all mail is reset to unread and deleted mail is undone. This is probably because Thunderbird reads the mail from the /var/mail/www-data file, but doesn't update this file. So after restarting, it simply reads this file again, with the new mail and all old mail. \n\n*This is probably a postfix issue: mail is sent out to existing mail addresses, but cannot be delivered because the receiving mailserver cannot be reached. This results in \"Undelivered mail returned to sender\". Only one mailserver can be reached: localhost. Because this is a test system, I don't want real customers to receive mail. I've blocked mail ports in UFW to be sure. \n\n\nWhen opening the returned mail, I can scroll down and then I see the original mail with proper layout. So I can read the mail, see if the proper images are included, and for me that's workable. Having to restart TB to read new mail - I know when new mail arrives, so I know when to restart. Having old mail restored after a restart - not big problem as well. I can delete the mail file if it gets too much.

This means that the folders and files that Thunderbird needs to use must be available to Joe.\n\n\n*\n\n*In particular, /var/mail/ needs to allow Joe to read and write files in it, so it either needs to be owned by Joe, or needs to allow group or world permission to Joe.\n\n*Same for the files within /var/mail/, i.e. your mail spool file(s), e.g. mail, or joe, etc. need to allow Joe to read and write them.\nYou might have to chown them to Joe, or chmod them to allow Joe to read and write to them.\n\nNote that the older default mail spool location is soft linked to the new default mail spool location, as follows:\n`/var/spool/mail` -> `../mail`, i.e. -> `/var/mail`,\n\n\n3 - Here are screen shots of what worked for me with a few comments:\n\nThe following is the address that is used for sending.  I found later that I could not forward emails with this as it is, and had to instead replace the 'localhost' in it with a real domain name.\n\nNote, Next won't become active above until you enter a valid domain name, in this case 'localhost'.\n\n\n\n\n4 - Next we need to point this new account to /var/mail/\nBut I stumbled here, and Thunderbird for a moment seemed buggy to me.  Be sure that you edit the new account's server settings, and not your local folder's settings.\n\n\nNote: Even after I set the Local directory:, the Message Store Type remains grayed out for me.  Perhaps Thunderbird automatically figures this out.\n\nThen it prompts for to restart Thunderbird:\n\nAfter the reboot I finally get these two folders.  Inbox still is empty, but the folders allow me to view, copy print, etc the email in them.\n\n\nUsage tip: Right clicking on mail@localhost and then selecting Get Messages re-reads my two folders and puts any new message in them into Inbox, before clearing these folders.\nNote the new msgFilterFules.dat, Sent, Sent.msf, Trash, Trash.msf and other related .msf files in your mail folder.\nAlso note that you can have more than one of these accounts.  I had noticed that I also had a /home/<username>/mail/ folder and so hooked this up with a 2nd account for debugging.\n\nNow I have to go figure out if exim will allow the new folder and file permission settings... :-.\n\n(For the record, I'm on Debian Stretch 9.6, but otherwise this seems to be the same as for Ubuntu.  I'm running Thunderbird 60.3 - 64 bit.)\n\nA: Unfortunately, Thunderbird removed the ability to create a \"movemail\" account as of version 87. Therefore, setting up Thunderbird as described in this answer will not work.\nWhat you have to do, after installing and setting up Postfix, is as described in that same answer, is install and setup dovecot.

I am using ubuntu 13.04 version.I am newbie for ubuntu.Can i able to install LAMP as non-root and without using sudo apt-get?\n\nA: You can run a standalone version of Apache/MySQL/PHP and Perl using xampp. Which means you don't need to use apt-get to install anything. However since it listens for incoming requests on privileged ports you need to start it using sudo. I can't see any way around running it without sudo privileges. If you don't have root on the box in question, which I'm presuming you don't, then why don't you ask the admin to give you sudo for the start/stop xampp commands or install the stack for you?\n\nA: Provided your system has the resources to accommodate a virtual machine, you could try a much cleaner approach. You can install a pre-made lamp stack from bitnami or turnkey. This approach is cleaner because your host system is left unaffected. Plus you get to play - if you like - with a bunch of different technologies like connecting to and managing a remote server (either through the web interface or via command line), configuring networks, setting-up/modifying ssl settings, etc. You can explore at your heart's content and it's a great learning experience. \nEdit: Just to make things clear. Both bitnami and turnkey offer native installers for a wide range of operating systems. This option installs a full blown stack on your machine. What I am referring to in my answer is the virtual machine option. In this case you will download a ready-made virtual machine and run it with vmware (free player) or VirtualBox (free). This option is what I refer to as \"clean\" because it is completely autonomous from your host system and portable (you can copy the virtual machine files to another host at any time with no need to reconfigure anything)\n", "Q: Configuring Ubuntu vmware guest NAT I have a Windows host that runs guest Ubuntu VM via vmplayer. That virtual machine will be cloned, distributed among several people (running Windows hosts) and used for conducting a programming workshop. I am trying - and so far failing - to setup networking to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*The guest has to have access to the internet\n\n*All the clones should have the same hostname (let's say Workshop to be concrete)\n\n*The host system must be able to access its respective guest via that name (e.g. ping Workshop would ping the guest that is running on that host and not any other clone)\n\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Installed\" a NAT network adapter for the guest\n\n*Tried to connect the guest via DHCP, in /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n   hostname Workshop\n\nThat works as far as connecting to the internet is concerned. However, I am unable to connect to the guest from the host at all. (E.g. ping Workshop does not work; if I use the address returned by ifconfig it does not work either from the host).\n\n\n*\n\n*I then tried assigning a static address to the guest:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n     address 172.241.0.101\n     netmask 255.255.0.0\n     gateway 172.241.0.100\n\n(172.241.0.100 is the address assigned statically to the host by VMWare Network VMNet8 Adapter - that's the NAT adapter above). Now, I can ping 172.241.0.101 and telnet to it from the host. I can also ping and telnet from the guest to 172.241.0.100 (the host), but that's about it - there is no connection to the wider network. (I also can't access the guest via its hostname, but that's not crucial here since if push comes to shove I can use its address directly - as long as it is the same for everybody - and not the name).\nNow, I think I can use the bridged network connection option with DHCP and that will give me what I need in case of one VM (I did not try it in this case, but I remember doing it previously). However, in case of several VM's with the same hostname and their hosts connected to the same network that will be problematic, won't it?\nYour solutions and other advice will be much appreciated.\n\nA: First of all, yes, you won't be able to use a bridged network connection because all of the guests will have the same hostname, so you'll have to go with NAT.\nYou got part of the configuration right, however, your problem should be in the default gateway that you assigned to the guest. The default gateway, when using NAT, is not the IP of the host, it's the IP of a \"virtual switch\" that's connected to the NAT network. (The host VMnet8 adapter is merely another device connected to the network, to allow the host to communicate with the VM.) This virtual switch we're talking about gets the .2 IP in the subnet. So in your case, your /etc/network/interfaces should read:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n     address 172.241.0.101\n     netmask 255.255.0.0\n     gateway 172.241.0.2\n\nThis should grant your guest VM access to the internet (through 172.241.0.2), and also communicate with your host (172.241.0.100). So try it out and let me know if it works.\nIf it doesn't work (highly unlikely), then you need to find out what the IP of the virtual switch is. What you can do is let the VM get an IP through DHCP (i.e. change it to iface eth0 inet dhcp like you had it before), and then do route -n. This should show you the default gateway it's using. Use that IP in your static configuration.\n\nTo be able to ping the guest VM using its hostname Workshop, here's what you can do. You need to add an entry in the hosts file in Windows, which is located in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts. Edit that file to include the following line in the end:\nTo edit that file under Windows however, you need to open it as an administrator in Notepad or Wordpad...and sometimes it doesn't even let you save it, so you'll need to take a copy of the file somewhere, edit it, remove the .txt extension if it got one, and go back and replace the original one, and \"confirm\" it...oh how I love Linux. But anyways, here's the line you need to add:\n172.241.0.101    Workshop\n\nOnce this is done, you should be able to ping Workshop successfully from your Windows host.\nThough of course, to be able to deploy this in your workshop, you'll need to edit the hosts file in every single Windows host, unless you're also cloning the Windows machines.\nTip: since you're going to assign a static IP to your guest, make sure that the \"NAT network\" in VMplayer on all of your Windows hosts are using the subnet 172.241.0.0/16, because I think VMware randomly assigns a subnet to its virtual networks (VMnet1, 2, and so on), so VMnet8 might not be using the same subnet on another Windows host. If they're not, you'll need to manually give VMnet8 a subnet using the Virtual Network Editor in VMware.\n\nEDIT\nOkay. After the comments, here's what you need to do:\n\n*\n\n*Configure your (Windows) host machine to \"obtain IP address automatically\" on the VMnet8 adapter. It should get the IP 192.168.186.1.\n\n\n*Configure your (Ubuntu) guest machine to a static IP in the range 192.168.186.3 - 192.168.186.127. Let's use 192.168.186.3. Also, configure the default gateway and dns server to be 192.168.186.2 So your /etc/network/interfaces should be:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n     address 192.168.186.3\n     netmask 255.255.255.0\n     gateway 192.168.186.2\n     dns-nameservers 192.168.186.2\n\n\n\n*Test local connectivity by pinging 192.168.186.1 and 192.168.186.2 from the guest machine.

That data is long gone.\nI would like to restore the default content of /var/spool/ though. crontab seems to manage to write its own but to get postfix back online I have to reconfigure (or reinstall) it. These are just two systems that I know of. There could be dozens more.\nIs there any way to tick through all the installed packages and work out which should have something in /var/spool/? And by extension, is there any simple way to restore that data?\n\nA: After you've unmounted, and got rid of the configuration to mount /var/spool as tmpfs by removing it from /etc/fstab, you can run the following commands to reinstall all the packages which own files in /var/spool:\ndpkg -S /var/spool | sed 's/\\:.*$//;s/,//g' | xargs sudo apt-get install --reinstall\nThe dpkg -S command lists all of the packages which own /var/spool or something under it. The pipe to sed strips off the end and then removes the commas from the comma-and-space-separated list of package names. And finally the xargs is to pass the list of packages on to sudo apt-get install --reinstall as the list of arguments, rather than the normal STDIN that a pipe sends to.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 Multi Monitor Dell precision m4600 nvidia optimus I've been fighting for two days now trying to get mulitmonitor support for the my dell precision m6400 with a nvidia quadro 1000m. \nI recently saw that Nvidia's 319 drivers supported optimus, so naively I went in bright eyed and bushy tailed down the rabbit hole...\nI am currently in a docking station using 2 external monitors (over DVI) connected to the dock and I'd like to use the laptop screen as my 3rd monitor. \nI've tried using bumblebee and not, I've tried using the xorg.config I found on nvidia's website, I've tried using the ubuntu software center's additional drivers section.

I'm planning to build a computer for myself, on which I'll install Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit. This computer will be used for light gaming and office work. In order to save some money, I'm planning to use integrated graphics, but I don't know whether to choose the Intel HD Graphics 4000 (by using an Intel i5-3570K processor) or AMD Radeon 7660D graphics (by using an AMD A10-5800K processor).\nAccording to your technical knowledge / experience, which of these two choices is the best, in terms of stability and performance? I want my system to be stable, but, at the same time, I would like to have some fancy Compiz or KWin desktop effects, and play some games.\nI am more tempted to choose the AMD APU, because it's cheaper than Intel, and I have read from the Phoronix website, that this APU seems to work well, especially if using the proprietary Catalyst driver. But I still wanted to know your opinion. So, Intel or AMD integrated graphics?\n\nA: I have a hybrid AMD and Intel 3000HD in my laptop. From my experience Intel is a much easier choice. The Catalyst software for Linux is buggy and causes problems, not to mention relying too much on alternative drivers that could black screen you. \nIntel HD is by no means perfect, but by default this hardware will work as it should without needing an add in GUI or anything. \nAs far as gaming goes if these are more than Minecraft and Civilization, you will want to go with the AMD. \n\nA: I know this is quite an old post, but I stumbled across this and just thought I'd pitch in my two cents worth...\nI have been using Linux for quite a few years now, and have gone through a number of different systems (both laptops and desktops). Some computers I've bought for personal use, others have been issued to me by my employer.\nI agree fully with the two posts above - Intel is definitely the way to go for Linux. The Intel HD graphics driver is open source, and is included with the Linux kernel (which means you don't have to go to the effort of installing a binary proprietary driver from the manufacturer - which can be quite a daunting task on Linux the first few times).\nThe last AMD/ATI graphics cards I had were two 7780's. One was running on a AMD A8 motherboard, the other on an Intel i5 motherboard. Both had dual monitors - one 2560x1440, the other 1920x1080. While they \"kind of\" worked, they never worked satisfactorily. There were tearing issues, wobbly windows were not smooth (constant judder and lagginess), overscan issues etc etc etc. The end-user experience sucked.\nI heard a lot of good things about the nVidia drivers with Linux, so I spent the money on two GTX 660TI cards and used these to replae the 7780's. While the 660TI did work exceptionally well in single monitor mode, it struggled running two monitors. There was always tearing on the second monitor, things got juddery/janky if playing a movie etc.\nWith Ubuntu 14.04 (running the 3.13 kernel), things are much better with nVidia and multiple high resolution monitors. Everything is almost perfect (I'm using the proprietary nVidia 331.67 driver). I say \"almost\", because when I stream video from my NAS box using the default video player, things because jerky/laggy (with wobbly windows enabled, you really notice it when you drag a window around while the video is playing). This does not occur if playing the video in VLC player instead (so perhaps something to do with hardware acceleration/decoding).\nI've had the most satisfaction with the Intel HD on-chip GPUs. Every laptop I've owned with Intel HD graphics has run Linux beautifully. Even with the Intel HD 4000 in my Chronos 7, driving two monitors (the second running at 2560x1440) isn't a problem. Even when I steam video using the default video player, things are still smooth, fluid and snappy (it passes the wobbly windows test with flying colors :)).\nAs an experiment, I decided to rip out the 660TI from my Intel desktop machine and try the onboard Intel HD 4400. It worked extremely well, even with two monitors, although there was no convenient GUI to fix the overscan on the second monitor (I messed around with xrandr, but still wasn't able to completely get rid of the overscan). The other issue I had is the maximum resolution. The motherboard has a HDMI port and a DVI port - neither of which is capable of driving a 2560x1440 monitor (even though the box was stamped with \"Ultra HD 4K\", which is false advertising as far as I'm concerned). My laptops have DisplayPort or Thunderbolt ports, so they have no problem driving higher resolution monitors.\nFor a single monitor machine running Linux, I'd stick with Intel HD. If you want to drive multiple monitors, just be aware there's no easy way (i.e. a GUI) to deal with overscan. If you want to drive monitors higher than 1920x1080, then just make sure your motherboard comes with a port capable of of higher-than-HD output (DisplayPort and Thunderbolt will drive 2560x1600, and probably higher).\n\nA: I feel it's important to add a small caveat in regards to Intel drivers \"just working\". If you plan on using dual monitors, it's important to switch from SNA to UXA. This can be done by adding the following to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file (create this file if it doesn't already exist):\nSection \"Device\"\n  Identifier \"intel\"\n  Driver \"intel\"\n  Option \"AccelMethod\" \"uxa\"\nEndSection\n\nThis makes things much smoother, but it also results in some minor annoying artifacts (like if you have set opaqueness for the top bar, you'll see it flicker when dragging windows around). \n\nA: If you're using multiple high-resolution monitors, nVidia is the better option. Intel HD graphics struggles with 2 quad-HD monitors (2560x1440). I have a rig with an Intel Z97 motherboard. When running a Full HD TV and my Dell U2711, the Intel HD 4400 struggled (i.e. window movement becomes slightly (but noticeably) jerky). When running the same two monitors with my nVidia GeForce 660TI (running driver 337.25 beta) everything is silky smooth and responsive.\n\nA: Your needs for graphics are pretty low by modern standards. Specifically, nearly all graphics chipsets can handle the kind of effects you're interested in. Pretty much every computer sold today can handle Windows Aero, and other than a few specific quirks (more below), they require the same thing to make work on a technical level. All modern chipsets support those things.\nConsidering your list of priorities, I'll assume that you're not a gamer and no need to squeeze every bit of performance or use every esoteric graphics ability. With that said...\nGo Intel.\nIntel's video drivers are open source, and fully supported by Ubuntu and the open source communities not only on Ubuntu, but on every distro. Intel hasn't released nearly as many versions of their video chipsets, and while this is bad for gamers who want ultimate performance, it dramatically simplifies the choice for people who want responsive video playback, desktop effects, and moderate quality for casual gaming.\nAMD/ATI has, on the other hand, released many chipsets, and supported them to varying degrees over time. While AMD now has fully-supported open source drivers, sometimes it requires knowing the specific model and chip that you're using in order to know which open source driver works the best with it.\nAs a non-gamer, I find that just having the Intel chipset auto-detected and \"just working\" is worth a few extra bucks.\n", "Q: How to install Google Earth on Ubuntu?

This can happen because a disk is being re-used and was once RAIDed, because RAID is legitimately active but Linux isn't recognizing that fact, or for other reasons. If you're certain the disk should not be RAIDed, you can remove the stray data by typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda (substituting the device filename, if it's not /dev/sda).\n\n*The partition table contains errors. Some of these can actually be legitimate, but libparted (upon which the Ubuntu installer relies) is very fussy. If the disk uses the old MBR partition scheme, my FixParts utility (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu, IIRC) can fix most such problems -- but be cautious! FixParts will fix some problems by deleting one or more partitions! If the disk uses the newer GPT scheme, you'll need to do some more thinking. My gdisk program includes a v command to analyze the disk, and this will identify some problems. If you're very lucky, launching gdisk on a GPT disk and then typing w to save the changes will fix the problem -- but don't do this without at least first verifying the partition table's contents with p. See my page on repairing GPT disks for more information.\n\n\nNote that the vast majority of computers that ship with Windows 8 use GPT; however, if you installed Windows 8 yourself (including re-installing it on a computer that shipped with Windows 8), it might use either MBR or GPT.\n", "Q: How i can add bookmarks in files or Pantheon Files 0.1 I installed this software but I can't find the option to add bookmarks, or add to my favorite places.\n\nA: Go to the folder you want and press Ctrl+Dand voilà! the bookmarks shows!\n\nA: I have a little trick for this, install or open (already installed in elementary os luna) nautilus and add your bookmarks, then close and open phantheon files and voilà! the bookmarks shows!\n\nA: Have you tried dragging it on the sidebar, or stuff like this?

This only happens in Ubuntu, and I did not installed any certificates (manually) on either partition when trying to correct the issue.  The browser also appears to be irrelevant (Chrome/Firefox both generate the same error).  Forgive my ignorance on certificates, but this seems to be beyond my expertise.\nThere are a few places I've looked through various search engines, and I found other users who have had similar issues with certificates in the Linux Citrix Receiver, but I'm not sure what's wrong with this certificate, as none of the other suggestions I've tried have worked so far, and they're too numerous to go into detail... so I'd like to take it from here and see what you all can offer up.\n\nA: Newer versions of the receiver require you to convert the CRT file to PEM, place the crt in a specific directory, and run a citrix utility.\nIf your installation is in /opt/Citrix/ICAClient and assuming the signing root certificate or CA is an existing one in ca-certificates:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get to the certificates directory:\n\n\ncd /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/\n\n2. Convert the desired CRT to PEM :\nsudo openssl x509 -outform pem -in [SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_YOU_ID_FROM_COMPANY_WEBSITE.crt] -out [NEW_CERT_PICK_YOUR_NAME.pem]\n\n\n3. Link it to the Citrix directory and rehash:\nsudo ln -s NEW_CERT /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/\ncd /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/util\nsudo ./ctx_rehash\n\nIf the CA is not a known and trusted one present in the /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla directory mentioned above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download it using your browser's security info on the site\n\n*Convert it to PEM Move it, and rehash: Step 3 above.\nLeft the crossed out text for anyone needing those instructions for whatever reason but I recently tested just moving the CRT to the directory and the rehash utility will convert as needed.\n\nA: To prevent the SSL error 61 when accessing remote sessions:\nMake Firefox's certificates accessible to Citrix,\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/* /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts\nsudo /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/util/ctx_rehash\n\nSource: Citrix help page\n\nA: some users (like me) might find that even after linking Firefox to the cacerts folder the error persists.  \nThat appears to be because Citrix does not supply all of the latest certificates.\nThe solution appears to be to note the certificate said to be \"not trusted\" (eg \"Verisign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5\") then export it from Firefox (under the Preferences menu then Certificates) to */ICAClient/keystore/cacerts.\nWorked for me.  Hope this helps.\n\nA: I've the same error, but with a certificates trusted by my FireFox. So after copy the root ca certificate and converted these in crt files, the ICA client run without problem.\nHope this info will be useful \n\nA: I had the same issue and solved it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place certificate to be trusted in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\n\n*Execute sudo update-ca-certificates \nYou should see something line this:\n1 added, 0 removed; done.\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d....\nAdding debian:SymantecClass3SecureServerCA-G4.pem\n\n*Use Google Chrome instead of Firefox\n\n", "Q: How do I install a program using a .md5 file? This is a very basic question that probably has a very easy answer.\nI am a frequent customer at humblebundle.com and some of the games\ncome in a format called \".md5\". I understand it is a format that is used\nto check an image for errors (after some very superficial googling).\nIs it possible to open the file with a specific program or is it necessary\nto use a terminal? Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the terminal, but I am\na non-programming-languages-knowing kind of guy who just uses Ubuntu for the\nfun of it. I would appreciate any answer.\nThank you in advance in case you are taking a look at it!\n\nA: MD5 is an algorithm used, among other things, to check data integrity.\nFor example, read here or here for instructions on how to check if a .iso file has been downloaded correctly (there's no need to rename the files, though).\nSo, you should get the programs, that mainly come as .deb, .bin, or .tar.gz (but other possibilities exist), besides of the .md5 \"checksum\" file.\n\nA: Like you found via Google, MD5 files are used to check the validity of a file when compared with the original. \nAs for installing via an MD5 file, that's impossible. MD5 files are only for testing validity. \nMy guess is that those games that come in, like you say, the .md5 format were one of two things:\n1. The download got really messed up and you only got the .md5 file used for checking validity...\n2. The file you downloaded only had the .md5 file in it, no game or other files.\nTo tell which one it is, try downloading the game again and then seeing if only the .md5 file is there. If it is, you know that that is the only file you can download and you should contact the site administrators/tech-support.\n", "Q: Ardour 3 and Superior Drummer Is it possible to have Ardour3 working with Superior Drummer 2.0 ?\nI own an Alessis DM10, just wanted to start playing with midi and superior drummer. \nAnother enviroment is welcome too.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install airwave manager (https://github.com/phantom-code/airwave)\n\n*Open airwave, create a new link\n\n*Show airwave where is located the superior drummer dll (vst plugin location)\n\n*Show airwave where it can make the bridge, choose a folder where your DAW can locate the VST bridge (link location).\n\n*Choose a name for a bridge. \n\n*Click OK and close Airwave manager\n\n*Go to your DAW and go the settings part where you can set a path to VST's. Just set the same path you set on \"link location\" on airwave.\n\n*Your DAW should now find the VST and identify it as a LXVST (linux vst). \n\n\nBut you also may want to set your system with wine-rt so the plugin can work on realtime.\n\nA: Superior Drummer 2.0 is a VST I believe, so it would have to be compiled for linux. Which I don't think it is.\n\nA: Superior Drummer is a VST and only available for Windows or OS X platforms. The developers do not support native Linux. With Ardour 3, VST support is available, however, as the VST is a Windows binary, it will be running under Wine, which the VST may not run entirely correctly under. This also assumes that the Windows VST support was compiled and installed in the package.\nFor an open source drum machine, you can install the hydrogen package. Hydrogen works with JACK as well, and can easily be recorded from inside Ardour.\n", "Q: How do I configure existing Postfix server to use external Spamassassin server? I have an existing Postfix server using greylisting, and need to utilize an external, existing Spamassassin server which is managed by someone else. How can I configure that? I am thinking I would use spamc.\n\nA: I went with creating my own content filter and butchered the example script here\nThe difference between the above example script and what I wanted to achieve was that I only wanted spamassassin to give me a spam score, by using the following\nspamc -d 10.10.10.50 -p783 -c < [mail msg]\n\nwhere\n-d is the spamassassin host\n-p is the tcp port\n-c 'check only'\nspamc can be installed by using apt-get install spamc\n", "Q: CPU Upgrade Issue Is it possible to upgrade CPU (ex: from AMD Athlon II X2 to Phenom II X4) without any problems? I means just replacing the old cpu with new cpu at same socket and booting ubuntu with any problems or changing something.\n\nA: Ubuntu generates most of its hardware configuration dynamically on boot. There are set configurations and overrides (udev stores hardware names so things are consistent between boots, and network configurations can be made to be hardware-specific) but these shouldn't cause terminal issues.\nEven the graphics stack is separated out and dynamic these days but you are more likely to run into issues in this area. Again, not terminal issues - just ones that require you to remove the old driver. And that's only in some scenarios.\nIn short, Ubuntu doesn't care what CPU you're running, as long as it's compatible (which in your case, it is).\n\nA: As far as I can see, there should be no problem, especially since the rest of your hardware stays the same.\n\nA: As long as the motherboard and chipset support that processor, there should be zero changes to the operating system (Ubuntu). The instructions will still be computed the same way.\n", "Q: Why won't COM2 work? What is the command for turning COM2 (Header Connector) on. Motherboard is a Intel D2500HN with one DB9 (COM1) and a header connector for COM2. We were using the Intel D425KT and both COM ports worked fine.\n\nA: Try minicom.\n\nminicom is a friendly serial communication program.

When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install minicom\n\n\nA: What does ls /dev/ttyS* show? That command should show give you a list of the available serial ports. Also be sure that you have enabled the serial port in the bios.\nTo be able to access the serial port as a normal user you have to add that user to the dialout group.

I have a Truecrypt-encrypted drive that I want to install as a 2nd drive.\nHowever, I'm afraid that a family member who uses my computer might accidentally format my Truecrypt-encrypted drive (and erasing everything in it).\nSo my question is, is it possible to accidentally format such a drive in Nautilus? Or is launching and using Disk Utility the only way to format such a drive?\nIn Windows, a Truecrypt-encrypted drive shows up as an un-formatted drive in Windows Explorer, so it's just one-click away from an accidental format. To keep it safe, I had to remove the drive letter in Disk Management.\nAny help is appreciated. Ubuntu newbie here. :)\n\nA: The only way to format the drive that is installed by default is the Disk Utility, or with the liveCD/USB but accidental formatting should not be possible. It cannot be done via Nautilus.\nDisk Utility needs root privileges to make any changes so while you can get info on the disks and partitions, it cannot do anything else without a password. So if they have your administrator password the could reformat the drive but not with just a casual keystroke, they would have to \n\n\n*\n\n*select the drive and then \n\n*select the option to reformat \n\n*select the file-system to reformat to \n\n*confirm and then enter your password....\n\n\nWhen booting form the liveCD there is no password needed but to reformat they would first have to boot into the livedCD and then follow all the steps above minus the password.  So it could be done intentionally but not accidentally.\nIf you don't want them to have the password you could set them up a limited user account and then they would not be able to use any sudo commands, or setup your account to login without a password, (highly discouraged if this is a laptop in case of temporary loss). Slightly less secure if it's a desktop but anyone that has the computer in his possession and has a little know how can reset your password anyway....(can be done on Windows as well)\nThe fact that it is encrypted and by not be readable by Ubuntu makes no difference, the Disk Utility will behave the same.... the encrypted partition should just be listed as \"unknown \"\nIf you want you can remove the Disk Utility from the Software Center, and reinstall it if needed later; may be needed to erase a USB key or other drive but will not work on mounted drives so if you need to reformat you main drive you will need to use the liveCD/USB anyhow.\n", "Q: Attempting to Set Up a Minecraft Server Does anyone have any experience setting up a Minecraft server with Ubuntu using Putty?

So moving the Ubuntu folder to a different partition will give you a wubildr.mbr is missing or corrupt message like you saw.\nYou can just edit the BCD store directly by going to a command prompt (CMD.exe, making sure you select Run as administrator) and then changing the Ubuntu entry:\nbcdedit /set {uuid} device partition=C:\n\n(You have to figure out what the uuid is, by first running bcdedit and copying the one that shows for your Wubi entry. e.g. \nC:\\Windows\\system32>bcdedit\n\nWindows Boot Manager\n--------------------\nidentifier              {bootmgr}\ndevice                  partition=\\Device\\HarddiskVolume2\ndescription             Windows Boot Manager\nlocale                  en-US\ninherit                 {globalsettings}\ndefault                 {current}\nresumeobject            {1476af5e-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029}\ndisplayorder            {current}\n                        {1476af63-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029}\ntoolsdisplayorder       {memdiag}\ntimeout                 10\n\nWindows Boot Loader\n-------------------\nidentifier              {current}\ndevice                  partition=C:\npath                    \\windows\\system32\\winload.exe\ndescription             Windows 7\nlocale                  en-US\ninherit                 {bootloadersettings}\nrecoverysequence        {1476af60-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029}\nrecoveryenabled         Yes\nosdevice                partition=C:\nsystemroot              \\windows\nresumeobject            {1476af5e-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029}\nnx                      OptIn\n\nReal-mode Boot Sector\n---------------------\nidentifier              {1476af63-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029}\ndevice                  partition=D:\npath                    \\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr\ndescription             Ubuntu\n\nC:\\windows\\system32>bcdedit /set {1476af63-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029} device partition=C:\n\nAny BCD changes have to made while running Windows or booting to a Windows repair prompt.\n", "Q: binary-i386/packages file not found, how can I stop APT looking for them? An upgrade from lucid to precise went horribly wrong and it apparently tried to install part of an i386 arch on an amd64 machine. Too much to manually fix, so refreshed with a precise amd64 dist. Luckily install was on separate partition and all config and /home were saved so I could restore it and nothing lost.\nExcept for this issue all working fine for the past month, including new installs and updates.\nBut from apt-get update we still have:\n/var/cache/apt-build/repository/dists/apt-build/main/binary-i386/Packages File not found.\nNo partials found.\n\nIn all /etc/apt files the only binary-i386 entries are already commented out.\nAll the apt-get cleaning variations have been tried (I think...).\nWhat is flagging apt-get to look for these files?\n\nA: As written elsewhere, you may edit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-build.list to contain:\ndeb [arch=amd64] file:/var/cache/apt-build/repository apt-build main\n\nThis is due to the fact that now multi-arch is default on amd64, but apt-build only generates the amd64 repo (I do not know whether apt-build can build multi-arch or cross-compile). I tried to apt-get install apt-build:i386 as it may also solve the problem, but there were broken dependencies, so that venue may or may not be viable.\nBy the way, this is also a problem in Debian 7.0.\n\nA: OP's solution edited out of the question:\n\nNothing found anywhere, so after reading all the man pages and how-to's I looked for something referencing main or dist, instead of i386. In /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-build.list I found:\ndeb file:/var/cache/apt-build/respository apt-build main\n\nand could not find any reason that should be there.

Then double check again, if there is no more mysql process running around then:\nsudo service mysql start\nYou actually reminded me of something that happened a long time ago (Ubuntu 9.10 I think). It was the same thing but about 20 more processes.\n\nA: What would \"over-installed\" mean?

I have followed the instructions on the java website, but when I try to create the link to the mozilla directory, I get 'permission denied'. I'm logged on as the administrator. Is there a command I need to enter to act as administrator in terminal? I'm running 12.04 lts\n\nA: When you say \"logged on as the administrator\" I think you mean as a regular user with some special group memberships and sudo ability to run commands as the superuser \"root\". \nIn the \"User Accounts\" control panel this is what \"administrator\" means, as contrasted with \"standard\" accounts which can't escalate privileges. \nAs chaskes answered, even \"administrator\" accounts normally run as a regular user to increase security and avoid mistakes. You need to ask permission with sudo to get superuser privileges for the duration of a command.\n\nA: You want to preface the command with sudo:\nsudo ln -s <rest of command>\n\nYou will be prompted for your password.

You can paste it in terminal using:\nxsel\n\nAnd into any X application using middle mouse button or Shift+Insert.\n\nA: The closest I can think of is Ctrl+u, Ctrl+y\nThis would delete from cursor to the beginning of line, then paste from the readline buffer.\nThis isn't exactly the same as the clipboard though, but you would be able to paste inside the shell, if that is what you need.\n\nA: There is a program called screen. It creates a text windowing system that allows you to switch between multiple instances. But it also allows you to select text.\nsudo apt-get install screen\n\nThat command installs it.\nThen type screen\nYou use ctr-a to start the command sequence. Then press esc and your cursor will move in any direction. Press enter to start text selection, move to end point, press enter again. That will copy to buffer.\nThen ctr-a and then } will paste\nMore details about other commands here http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935\n\nA: Daniel Micay's Termite sports a \"selection mode\". Pressing Ctrl+Shift+Space will activate it. It's got vim-like key bindings. v or V will select à la vim's visual mode, y will yank, Esc will exit selection mode.\nCopied from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1536757/selecting-text-in-terminal-without-using-the-mouse/29386401\n\nA: Assuming bash or compatible, you can copy the command from your history to the clipboard after running it:\n$ fc -lrn | head -1 | xclip -se c\n\nIf you don't want to run it before copying it to the clipboard, jump to the front with Ctrl+A and temporarily turn it into a comment by adding #.\nHaving an alias for the command line above is handy when recording command line procedures for later reference or documentation. However, it's even more convenient to just append the last command directly to a file as needed by making a command like this (c2f=command to file):\n$ c2f() { fc -lrn | head -1 >> \"${1?}\"; }\n\nUsage:\n$ cat <(echo '!! example command that \"includes chars\" with shell > semantics, etc') | cat >&2\n$ c2f readme.md\n\nreadme.md now contains:\n...\ncat <(echo '!! example command that \"includes chars\" with shell > semantics, etc') | cat >&2\n\nTo make it quicker to edit the file later, it can also be convenient to slightly expand on the above and add some appropriate syntax wrapping the command being append to the file, such as ```bash...```.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Crashes After Updating Nvidia Card I installed the Nvidia GT 520M using the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nand then I restarted my computer and it logs in fine, however there is no menu bar, no side menu or anything, just my Desktop.

Now right now I can ssh into my remote server and run the ruby script to begin listening for connections to said port: \"ruby server.rb\". But as soon as I log out and close the ssh connection, the script presumably stops listening.

I want my script to do the same thing. I want to be able to run netstat and always see my program running and listening on a specified port.\nWhat is the best approach to take in this situation? Create a daemon? Or use nohup?\n\nA: Use a program called screen.\nInstall it on the server and run screen and any program that runs will remain active on the server.\nTo install it run \nsudo apt-get install screen\n\nMore details about other commands here http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935\n", "Q: The Software Center will open but will not respond I am using 12.04 and have only recently started using Ubuntu.

Download this small application according to your version of Ubuntu. After the completion of download, install the app.\nSTEP 2\nAfter the app is installed, go to the terminal and type hda-jack-retask which opens the file. Open app using terminal\nSTEP 3\nAt the top, in codec section, select IDT 92HD91BXX codec.\nThis code varies with various models. Check it\nSTEP 4\nCheck the “ Show unconnected pins” at the right side.\nSTEP 5\nAfter this, you will see different types of unconnected pins of your sound driver. You have to map these pins to the right part of the beats audio drive. Care must be taken at this point.\nYou can see there are various types of pins. We are not aware about these things. Even I don’t know\nwhat I am doing and is confusing. BUT do not worry at all.\nYou just have to play on three pins.

I have the latest version of Ubuntu installed on my computer.

That's annoying as hell. I don't want to keep Terminal windows open for every program I need in order to develop. I know that there's gksu but again, it's annoying to have to identify for everything again and again.\nAlso, I can't install sublime-text plugins because of permission denied errors. Again, I don't want to sudo every time I use sublime!\nIt's worth mentioning I'm developing in GUI, including running programs and whatnot.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: To be able to change any file from the file manager, use:\nsudo nautilus\nTo run it in the background use:\nsudo nautilus &\nTo change the files so you always have access to them, right-click on each folder and click Properties then the Permissions tab and then change the permissions in the dropdown to your username instead of root. Make sure you can read and write to the directory. This isn't safe for most configuration files.\nTo be able to change only the thing you're working on, you should always launch a terminal for that user that can change just the things you need. That's what makes Linux safe. Esspecialy for a server (wwww). Then launch the GUI's from that user. (Like nautilus or the text editor). To be able to change the files in the www folder use:\nsudo su - www-data -s /bin/bash (opens a new bash shell inside the shell with the www-data user)\nFrom here you can do things like:\ngedit &(this launches the gedit text editor in the background with which you can edit all file in the www folder. You can use any other editor. After this you can close the terminal if you don't want the debug info.)\nIf you made new files in the www folder with root, these files will have root as user and group, you should change these to www-data.\nwww-data could also be www or some other user.\nThe best way is still to copy, edit with normal user, backup and copy back with privillaged user and change permissions.

My laptop is running Ubuntu, the other two machines are running CentOS.\nThank you\n\nA: If you have a Middle Machine somewhere on the Internet where you can SSH into it both from Desktop and Laptop (the machines don't need to be on the same network at all), you can forward the traffic through Middle Machine quite easily:\nStep 1 - SSH from Laptop to Middle Machine:\nLaptop --------SSH-----> Middle Machine\n\nStep 1b - set up a TCP tunnel back to Laptop:\nLaptop --------SSH-----> Middle Machine\n      <--RemoteForward--\n\nStep 2 - SSH from Desktop to Middle Machine:\nLaptop --------SSH-----> Middle Machine <--SSH-- Desktop\n      <--RemoteForward--\n\nStep 2b - set up a TCP tunnel through Middle Machine:\nLaptop --------SSH----->   Middle Machine   <--SSH-- Desktop\n      <--RemoteForward-- <--LocalForward--\n\nStep 3 - SSH from Desktop through Middle Machine and RemoteForward to Laptop:\nLaptop --------SSH----->   Middle Machine   <--SSH-- Desktop\n       <--RemoteForward-- <--LocalForward-- <--SSH-- \n\nSee this answer on SuperUser on how to set this up (in that answer, Middle Machine is named serverpc, Laptop is officepc, Desktop is homepc). There is some extra network and CPU overhead due to the fact that you're running SSH-through-SSH, but it is surprisingly usable.\nAll this can be done as normal user using vanilla SSH in default configuration.

Which language to use? QML, C++.. I've done a thorough search around the web and I couldn't find a single sample application using sensors in ubuntu touch.\nI've tried to use QtMobility and the QtSensors plugin with QtCreator but it only runs the code on the desktop.

Leave the partitions where you'll install Linux unformatted, I assume you'll want to use ext4 and swap on them, and reserve a small partition, maybe 1GB, for the Linux installation media, that you can format to FAT32; copy the content from your installation ISO (not the ISO file itself) to this partition; add an entry to this partition to the Windows boot loader with EasyBCD, you can find how on the Internet, such as in this article. Note the order of your partitions so you'll remember which one you'll format and install on it, then restart and boot into the Linux live session from the install partition and perform normal installation. The installer will recognize the existing EFI system partition and will copy a boot entry there, but you can add another entry for your installed Linux to the Windows BCD the same way you added for the install partition.\n\nA: Do you have access to a screw-driver and another computer?\nWindows must be installed on the same machine that it will run on, but Linux is less fussy. :)\nWhen I've been in this position before I've removed the hard drive from the problem computer and attached it to another computer.

(Actually, I did it in a Qemu/KVM VM booted from the .iso image, but that was just showing off.)\nFinally, I moved the drive back to its real home and it should Just Work. You might have trouble with UEFI though (maybe you can disable secure boot in the settings)?\n\nA: There are 4 ways to install Ubuntu as dual boot on a machine already running windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a CD. You can't/won't do it.\n\n*Use a USB drive. You can't/won't do it.\n\n*Use the .iso file in a virtual machine as a means to avoid CD/USB such that it also boots alongside Windows. You claim you can't/won't do it.\n\n*WUBI. Not compatible with UEFI.\nSorry, but you're stuck. It may be possible to do something really cunning using Windows ext2 drivers, an iso image extractor and a lot of both Linux and Window know how, but if you could do that you wouldn't need to ask questions here.\nI've already provided an answer for machine that have no CD and won't boot from USB.

I wish to use Windows mount style in Ubuntu, i.e.\n/C/ mount point\n/F/ mount point\n\nI know it is not about standards, but may ease user expluatation.\nDoes this method have any issues from technical side?\n\nA: Yes, you can name your mountpoints pretty much any way you want (although there are conventions on \"what is usually stored/mounted under what path\"); note however that you'll always need a / (root) filesystem to mount them to. I cannot vouch for each and every program to remain stable (programmers are lazy and prone to unreasonable assumptions), but overall there shouldn't be much problems.\nHowever, the conventions mean that a lot of software is looking for stuff in the usual places - e.g. for \"Windows style\" mounts, the folder /media is used (many programs check it for \"mounted drives\"); if you mount your drives elsewhere, they'll be accessible, but you'll need to remember where you've put them ;)\nNote that programs installed through package manager(s) usually reside in /usr; if you're looking to change this, it might be a bit more work (but still ultimately possible).\nIt is also possible to \"bind mount\" a filesystem or its part, making the files accesible in multiple ways - e.g. you could have /home/user accessible as /U/ by doing mount --bind /home/user /U ; for details, see http://docs.1h.com/Bind_mounts\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS no sound in select apps I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and for some reason I get no sound whatsoever in a few programs.

I'm just curious if it is possible do it. I have a spare 4gb sd card.\n\nA: Because the bandwith of the SD card interface is quite low compared to even a regular HDD (around 20Mb/s compared to 70-100Mb/s) it will be much slower. Where you can gain speed is by adding as much RAM as possible, and using an SSD instead of the HDD.\n\nA: The question is about using an SD card to store frequently accessed files caching these in de SD card instead of the pagefile... That's Windows stuff in fact. Windows uses a special algorythm amd compression to do that. However: Even in our \"beloved\" MS operating system ReadyBoost does only provide a very limited improvement on realtively up to date hardware and it is more a way to speed up older drives.\nI know that your question is not about MS Windoze, but before giving an answer for Linux I had to exaplain what the hype is all about.\nLinux does not work like Windows (and neither Mac OS X for that matter) and the key here is memory management. All this readyboost stuff just isn't applicable and it doesn't make much sense. In Linux the closest thing would be using the SD card as extra swap... you can find it here in Lifechaker \nBUT before doing that I would encourage you to read the comments.\nSo, maybe your 4GB SD card may be better employed for other stuff such as putting a little virtual machine into it or holding a small read-only rescue system. \nBTW: In Raspberry Pies this stuff seems to make actual sense ;)\n", "Q: With gpg --verify, how do I distinguish valid signatures and valid signatures from trusted keys programmatically?

Install them, or just extract them.\nYou can even re-build the sources/grab them if you need to.  \nJust an extra bit of information: \"dget\" is a great tool. It grabs the source, the patches, and prepares the source in a folder, just like the binary package got it.  \nSo you can recompile the files the way you want, and it will have the same Ubuntu/Debian patches.\n(You can, of course, remove these patches if you want to.)\nYou can install dget by: sudo apt-get install devscripts\n\nA: What you need is the tcl package.

The predominate hypothesis on the internet is that noise from the power line isn't properly filtered out, and it can be worked-around by plugging it into a surge protector (I just verified this myself, as I'm typing this on my Series 9 and just plugged into a surge protector).\nI was clued into this from this comment:\n\n*****Final Update***** So it seems that Samsung has been plagued with more issues related to the touchpad and many commenters have related it to something having to do with the power connection.  Apparently when the AC adapter is plugged in the touchpad goes wacky.  When unplugged it works fine.  The solution has been to purchase a cheap power conditioner to put inline with the adapter.

I have a ~/photos directory where I keep all my photos. I'd like it to be automatically sync'd to flickr (with their recent generous expansion...) -- all pictures in this directory automatically uploaded to Flickr (visible to me only and without any manipulation/resizing). \nIs there a tool for this job? Preferably, not some hacky python script in cron. \nRight now, I'm using Shotwell to organise photos. And it works fine.

Haven't tested that either :)\nFirstly you could look into flickrfs. As I understand it enables to create virtual drive through which you can upload/download your files between your Flickr account and Ubuntu.\nTo enable sync you could use additional application that would sync between your photos folder and that virtual drive. For an example, you could use rsync or Unison for that. If you go that route then remember to test the virtual drive before you set up the sync.\nMight not work and probably painstaking to set up but hopefully works flawlessly ever after. \n\nA: \nTry Conduit.\nConduit, a program for the Linux desktop, makes it simple to link your\n  web data, desktop files, and other information all together, then\n  synchronize them all with a single click. \nWhat is Conduit?\nConduit is a synchronization application for GNOME. It allows you to\n  synchronize your files, photos, emails, contacts, notes, calendar data\n  and any other type of personal information and synchronize that data\n  with another computer, an online service, or even another electronic\n  device.\nConduit manages the synchronization and conversion of data into other\n  formats. For example, Conduit allows you to :\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Synchronize your Tomboy notes with another computer\n  \n*Synchronize your your PIM data to your mobile phone, iPod, Nokia    Internet tablet, or between computers\n  \n*Upload photos to Flickr, Picasa, SmugMug, ShutterFly and your iPod\n  \n  \n  Any combination you can imagine, Conduit will take care of the\n  conversion and synchronization. \nConduit's interface is meant to make data-syncing simple, and, for the\n  most part, it does. Simply drag and drop icons that represent your\n  data in the \"cloud\" (Flickr photos, YouTube Videos, Box.net backups,\n  etc.) or your actual, physical stuff (files, folders, iPods, data\n  apps) into the \"canvas,\" and start making connections. Add the\n  \"sources\" of your data first, followed by all the points that will\n  receive it. Right-click on any item in your chain to configure it,\n  whether that means pointing to specific folders or logging into your\n  Flickr, Box.net, or Facebook accounts from pop-up windows.\n\nTo install Conduit, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Start there, then let us know if you have acquired known good images. Check the physical connections on the target machine. Next, burn them then check the burn and again verify that it has been burned properly and without error.\nLet us know where you stand after that is done please.\n", "Q: Can't Mount External Drive After Reformatting I just bought a Toshiba Canvio 2TB external hard drive. I then installed GParted, and reformatted the drive to ext4 (following the instructions in part 1 & 2, at this blog). \nThe instructions didn't say anything about this, but I think I should've added a boot flag to the drive, 'cause now it won't automount, and GParted won't show the drive, and fdisk -l doesn't even show the drive. So I'm not sure how to mount it or find a way to add a boot flag... if that's even what I need to do.\nHow do I get to where I can edit the drive's partitions and stuff? Can I format the unallocated 1.02MB on the drive to boot? The unallocated space does show up in GParted. I really hope I didn't just brick this $100.\nUPDATE: Here's the output when I sudo fdisk -l\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0003ae80\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   969058303   484528128   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       969060350   976771071     3855361    5  Extended\nPartition 2 does not start on physical sector boundary.\n/dev/sda5       969060352   976771071     3855360   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\n...the partition I formatted, was something like /dev/sdb or something like that, but it doesn't show up.\n\nA: Don't worry; your drive is just fine.\nWhen you unmount a drive in Linux (which you had to do in order to format it,) sometimes it won't be re-recognized until you reboot your computer.\nTry rebooting, and see if that fixes the problem.\nThere's nothing that GParted can do anyway that would prevent sudo fdisk -l from noticing the drive. (you did remember sudo, right? ;)\nIf, for whatever reason, the drive isn't recognized after you reboot, it (likely) wasn't your fault.\nAfter rebooting, if the drive doesn't appear in the launcher, try running GParted again and see if it recognizes the drive. Then check the filesystem on the Ext4 partition (from within GParted.) It'll detect and repair any errors to the filesystem itself. After that, reboot again.\nYour partition table is screwed up.\nLooking at the output of sudo fdisk -l, I'd have to deduce that your partition table got corrupted. Try opening GParted and going to Device > Create Partition Table, then create a new msdos partition table (the default.) After that finishes, create a new EXT4 partition, but this time tell it to align to Cylinder instead of MiB. (You might lose a tiny bit of space, like .01 GiB tops.)\nAPPLY the partition creation, then expand the partition to the right, if there's any unused space an that side. (DO NOT move/expand to the left, this will defeat the point of aligning it to Cylinder.)\nIt seems that the drive shipped with a faulty partition table, which worked with the default formatting (somehow,) but failed when you tried to repartition it.\n\nA: You could try disconnecting the external drive and then entering the following in a terminal:\n\ntail -f /var/log/messages\n\nThis will give you a running commentary of what your machine is up to.\nReconnect your drive and see what (if anything) is happens here and if your machine is getting an error or anything when trying to read or mount the drive. \nIf nothing new appears here then see if any lights on the hard drive are coming on. Perhaps the USB element of the external hard drive enclosure has failed in some way. \nI hope this at least points you in the right direction\n\nA: Don't worry.. not setting a boot flag will not brick your drive (trust me-I've managed to think I've bricked more than one router!) \nIf your problem is having the drive mount upon boot, realize that the uuid changes upon format, so you will have to issue another sudo blkid and change /etc/fstab accordingly.\nSo your new fstab might look something like this...\nUUID={YOUR-UID}    {/path/to/mount/point}   ext4   defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\nfill in the uuid with the results from sudo blkid and change your mount point path and you should be a-ok.\n", "Q: Second monitor (VGA) isn't detected ubuntu 12.04 ATI Radeon HD 5400 I have tried several solutions but nothing works. First of all, I'm using ATI Radeon HD 5400. The first monitor (which works) is connected to the graphic card by DVI, the second monitor (which isn't detected) is connected to the motherboard by VGA. One important point - when I used Windows (yesterday?) the two monitor worked together fine. \nWhat I've done until that moment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Followed by the instructions here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI#Installation_via_the_Ubuntu_repositories.\nInstalled fglrx by writing sudo apt-get install fglrx.

It is either onboard or GPU but not both and probably has nothing to do with your GPU being ATI.\nI faced the same problem while it could work on Windows 7 (Nvidia + onboard + two monitors),  on Kubuntu 13.03 the second monitor just turned on from sleep but it didn't show anything (black screen). \nLinux and the current graphic server, in most cases cannot handle such setup.\nFortunately my GPU had an extra output and my problem solved by using only the GPU.\nYou can read more about this at https://superuser.com/a/404700/71345\n", "Q: Can I use the Ubuntu SDK Preview in Linux Mint?

Just in the last week or two I have started to have a problem where playing sound through the headset when in Chrome causes the sound (and video if watching Youtube or similar) to play in slow motion. If I switch off of the BT headset and keep playing the sound, it stays in slow motion. If I refresh the page, it plays properly. I've noticed this happening with Google Hangouts too.\nTrying things in FF seems to be fine, and switching Youtube to HTML5 doesn't seem to help. This problem seems to coincide with a change to Ubuntu that has given me two BT icons in my task bar instead of one. I tried researching why that happened and came up empty there too. This could be a straight up chrome issue, but I thought I would go the Ubuntu + BT route for investigation first.\n\nA: I'm having the same issue. To add to the problem:\nIf I'm playing a clip and I switch audio outputs to the BT headset, the continues to play normally, but when I refresh the page or go to a different clip, it goes to slow motion again.\n\nA: I am willing to bet that this issue is somehow related to configuration issues with pulse or alsa. I have an HP DV7 with Beats audio, and I have been spending a huge amount of time messing with audio config files to get my built in subwoofer to work with all of my other speakers. I can usually get some combination of them to work, but not all of them at the same time yet. At any rate, my computer also has a built in bluetooth module, and I use LG HBS-700 bluetooth headphones(awesome headphones BTW). Normally audio works properly out of the box, but after I start messing with stuff, I start to get this issue. Audio plays normally out of speakers(after refresh like OP), but bluetooth sounds heavily distorted. Unfortunately, I do not know much about the principles behind the linux audio system, but if somebody does, let us know so we can start working on this thing. \n\nA: This has seemingly gone away with recent updates, so lets hope it stays that way!\n", "Q: can't run a make file of a C program I have a small  a program that should start a 2nd Thread. the problem is that, when try to make an executable file  of this program using make.

As a bonus, I've included total Swap as well.\n$ awk '/MemTotal/ || /SwapTotal/' /proc/meminfo                                \nMemTotal:        1789444 kB\nSwapTotal:        524284 k\n\n\nA: Also easy to use commands to check RAM:\nfree -lm\n\nUsing top command itself or:\ntop | grep -i mem\n\nSimilar to top but a bit more advanced is htop but the package has to be installed sudo apt-get install htop then run:\nhtop\n\nWill output memory scale in terminal.\nAlso vmstat can do this:\nvmstat -s -SM\n\n\nA: Open a terminal: Ctrl +Alt + T \nThen type: sudo lshw\n\nA: *\n\n*Open System Settings.\n\n*Click Details at the bottom of the panel.\n\n*You will see details about your PC (such as RAM).\n\nA: I like the output that sudo dmidecode -t 17 gives.

And that it breaks it down by slot, so you have a bit more idea about what your upgrade options are.\ndmidecode (man page) tells you about your system's hardware.  Specifying -t 17 filters by the \"Memory Device\" type.\n\nA: In general\nPlease keep in mind - many solutions in this post will only show how much memory the operating system detects (e.g. 32bit without PAE can only see 4GB)\nDetect memory slots and state using dmidecode\nAssuming you have sudo permissions you can use the dmidecode command to detect the amount of memory slots and what is inserted into them right now.\nExample usage:\nsudo dmidecode\n\nOr even better, filtered just for memory related informations:\nsudo dmidecode -t 17\n\nOutputs in my case:\n# dmidecode 3.0\nGetting

So I installed gnome 3.8 onto my ubuntu 13.04 pc.\nIt all works pretty fine except for one scrolling problem I resolved.\n(as a note, if anyone is having a problem where their scrolling no longer works after installing this, you can fix it in dconf for touchpad) \nAnyway on to my question. The guide installed gnome shell but I am missing a few applications for it. such as the clock or weather app. \nI was wondering if anyone knew a way to install these, thanks.\nI meant to include the guide I used, here it is: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/gnome-3-8-ppa-for-ubuntu-gnome\n\nA: Those apps haven't been installed because they are new apps in the repositories as apposed to updates. You can install them manually though.\nGnome Clocks is the package gnome-clocks and can be attained with:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-clocks\n\nGnome Weather is the package gnome-weather and can be attained with:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-weather\n\nIt probably isn't that hard to find the other new apps, if you have some idea of what they are called you can type it into apt-get install and press tab for auto-completes. For instance I found the weather app by typing:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-w\n\nand pressing tab.\n\nA: For the time, for some reason if you click on the battery icon there is a show clock option. that's how I made it show.\nThe proper way would be to go to System Settings and select 'Time and Date' then the Tab 'Clock', that should turn the clock on!\n", "Q: upgrade declined Recently there was a bubble that appeared saying that the new ubuntu upgrade is available, I declined it, clicking do not remind again, I am now having trouble starting and finding the upgrade link, can you point me in the right direction?\n\nA: In the Terminal, type in \nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThis will tell you if a new OS is available.\nI'll try and come up with a fix\nEdit\nIn Terminal type:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo update-manager -d\n\nThen follow the instructions to upgrade\n\nA: I am using lubuntu, I am sure that this works same for the ubuntu even\nfrom the menu bar on the left you see system settings, once you open that you can see softwares and updates icon at the bottom. \nIf you click on that there you find the bubble that you are looking for @pete \n", "Q: PDFs generated by LyX not searchable in 12.10 or 13.04 I recently updated one of my computers to 12.10 and did a clean install of 13.04 on another, but neither allow me to search a PDF that I exported using LyX (LaTeX editor).  I have no problem searching PDF's exported using TeXmaker on both computers, and I had no problems searching any PDF before I did the upgrade.\nUPDATE:  I've tried using other PDF readers (in 13.04) with mixed results.  Document Viewer (once called Evince I believe) and Okular have the same issue. I CAN search them, but only for words/letters that show up in a math environment. I still cannot search for words found in standard text environments.\nHowever, I was able to install linux versions of Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader and while their interfaces are not the best on Ubuntu, I am able to search anywhere in the PDF using either application. Thoughts?\n\nA: This doesn't sound related to ubuntu. It's much more likely that you're generating pdf files that aren't lining up with your expectations.\nSince you're doing pdf programming, it's worth knowing there are two main render libs for linux: poppler and mupdf. Gnome's default pdf viewer (and Unity's) is evince; it uses poppler. I usually test mupdf by building the latest version of llpp. But don't forget that Chrome ships with a pdf viewer plugin that I think is based on or made by Adobe. And Firefox now comes with pdf.js. Pdf.js is under heavy development. It's likely you'll hit some bad render bugs in firefox right now, but it's rapidly getting better (and all the bugs I've found were already fixed upstream..).\nMy most recent is experience is with itext, but I also like using tex/xelatex. I don't have problems making pdfs with searchable text. Since you're using tex stuff, you'll likely get better answers over at http://tex.stackexchange.com\nmy tests\nI encountered zero problems with search / select / copy / paste behaviour. Admittedly, I didn't create the pdf's on ubuntu.\nfiles made with:\n\n\n*\n\n*itext (images interspersed with text)\n\n*xelatex (hello world text)\n\n*lyx -> pdflatex (hello world text)\n\n\nOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu 12.04 livecd\n\n*ubuntu 13.10 livecd\n\n\nprograms:\n\n\n*\n\n*firefox / pdfjs\n\n*evince / poppler\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with pdflatex in Ubuntu 14.04. It had nothing to do with the render libs, as I have tested with different viewers in different OS. The solution was the installation of the CM-super's version of Computer Modern, as suggested in this link:\nSolution 4: With the CM-super's version of Computer Modern: \nInstall the cm-super font package ($ apt-get install cm-super on Debian/Ubuntu), then in your source:\n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\nThe rest of the configuration is automatically done by updmap.\nThe generated pdf is now searchable with all tested viewers: Document Viewer, Okular, Chrome and Firefox. All its features are 100% working.\n", "Q: Convert files to UTF-8 without BOM I have a file in Hebrew, which is displayed now as Gibberish. On windows, what I've done at the past, I just converted the file using Notepad++ > Encoding > Convert to UTF-8 without BOM and then Hebrew was displayed.\nOn Ubuntu if I'm using Notepad++ (running on Wine) when I convert it, it is still displayed as Gibberish (but success to convert it to UTF-8 without BOM).\nI wonder if there is a software which converts a file to UTF-8 without BOM at the same way as Notepad++ does (Convert -> Hebrew displayed > save).\nI don't know why it still displays GIbberish on Notepad + Wine when I convert it. Wine supports Hebrew as I know (I can write their Hebrew and save it without problem).\n\nA: Try Kate.\n\nKate is a multi-document editor.  Choose it for viewing HTML sources,\n  editing configuration files, writing new applications or any other\n  text editing task. You still need just one running instance of Kate.\nWith a multi-view editor like Kate you get a lot of advantages.

Is there any way I can do this? \n\nA: If you don't want the indicator to show up, you can uninstall the indicator-sync package, and stop the indicator-sync-service process from running.\nNote that it is a system indicator, and other applications, such as dropbox, may use it in the future to show information about sync status, and to interact with them.\n\nA: Since Ubuntu One has stopped being developed, you can simply just remove it (and everything that has to do with it) with\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntuone-*\n\nThat will also remove the indicator.\n", "Q: SYSLINUX 4.06 error on boot I'm a college student majoring in computer science and I thought it was finally time to switch to a \"computer scientists\" operation system.

I am trying to upload to github via SSH.  I generated my key using keygen, and made sure that github has the key as specified.  However, when I try to ssh in I keep getting a Ubuntu window opening asking for a password.  This is not coming from github, but from the Ubuntu system itself.  The keys are somehow password protected, which is fine, but I have absolutely no idea what that password might be.  It is not my root password.  It is not my user password.  I never actually set a password for those keys, so I am completely at a loss.  I've tried leaving it blank or just a space, but that doesn't work either.  I need to either find out what password this is, find a way to reset it to a password that I actually know, or somehow disable it.  The only posts I can find on this problem are much older ( 2008 ), and none of the files they talk about editing exist in 12.04.  \nEditing to clarify one more time.  This is a Ubuntu issue, not an SSH issue.  There is no issue with the key or the remote host.  The problem is with Ubuntu slapping a password on the use of this key without my knowledge and me having no idea what that password might be or how to reset / disable it.\n\nA: Normally if this ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa/rsa.pub remote-host works properly it will \nappend the keys to the remote-host’s .ssh/authorized_key\nAfter that you should be able to login to that particular remote-host without password.\nNB: Can you provide some more detail like how you added the key?

I recently (about a month ago) bought a Dell XPS 8500 Desktop with UEFI enabled Windows 8 Pro pre-installed. I am trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit dualboot with Windows on this computer. I don't know much about UEFI, but I think I followed the correct instructions to do this installation. Here's what I've done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a 256GB SSD drive with the Windows OS partition and a 1TB drive for data. I created a 100GB partition on the 1TB drive for ubuntu. This was done through Windows Disk Management.\n\n*I downloaded Ubuntu and created a bootable USB as per the instructions on the Ubuntu website. \n\n*I tried installing Ubuntu through the USB.\nPROBLEM: While installation, I do not see a \"Install alongside Windows 8\" option like I have usually seen in all my previous installs. \nNow, I don't know if this has to do with UEFI and I don't know much about that anyway. \nQUESTION: How should I proceed with the installation?\nI am currently on the same computer through Windows. I also have access to a laptop with Windows 8 Pro (possibly not enabled with UEFI - it's an old computer with newly installed OS) alongwith Ubuntu 12.10 dualboot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Let me also add that my Secure Boot is ON. I also tried it with SecureBoot OFF, but didn't work. \n\n*I followed all the steps mentioned here in order: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nEDIT: I \"tried\" Ubuntu without installing it via the LiveUSB. It is not able to access any of the drives. Do you think that has anything to do with this issue? Any help would really be appreciated. Thank you so much.\n\nA: *\n\n*Use the Windows tools to shrink your Windows partition.\n\n*Disable SecureBoot in your BIOS\n\n*Install Ubuntu in the free space via the Something Else install option. You will just need to create a SWAP partition (few GB), and the rest as root partition, see this page for more info.\n\n*Reboot\n\n*If you cannot access Windows or Ubuntu, run Boot-Repair to fix the GRUB menu.\n\n\nA: You should defragment your Windows partition, as far as I know Windows comes with a tool for that.\nOnce defragmentation is complete you have to perform a \"full shutdown\" in Windows, as by default it does like a hibernation when shutting down. To do that search for cmd in Windows Search and it will point you to the command line prompt, start it and execute the following command:\nshutdown /s /t 0 \n\nNow you have to start a Ubuntu live session by booting a Live-USB and choosing the option: Explore Ubuntu without installing.\nWhen the desktop loads up, start GParted and you should see the EFI partition at the start of the partition table followed by your drive C:\\ partition, click on the C:\\ partition and re-size it to make room for Ubuntu partition. Click on the \"Apply\" button of GParted and wait until it completes the operations.\nNow start the Ubuntu Installator, when it prompts you for the installation type you should choose Something Else, the last option.\n\nAnd now you just select the free space and click the + button at the bottom.\n\nCreate the new partition as Primary type, using Ext 4 journaling file system and setting mounting point to /.\n\nAfter installation is complete just reboot and check if everything works fine. Although, as your Windows is installed in UEFI mode you can experience problems, such as booting straight to Windows and not passing through GRUB. For problems like that you should use Ubuntu Boot-Repair tool. Also check these Q&As if in trouble: Windows 8 doesn't allow Ubuntu start-up\n and https://askubuntu.com/a/292783/21195 .\n\nA: you should reboot - then go to bios-mode (with F2 or else F-key - depends on vendor)\nthere enable efi - and not uefi.\nexit and save.\nreboot and try to install ubuntu again.\nhere are more informations:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 ethernet is not working?

The problem seems to be related to the driver supplied in the current kernel versions; rolling back the driver seems to work for most cases.

I'm not looking to dual boot, just want to see if its possible to install Studio on top of 13.04.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Ubuntu Studio, as it name describes, is a Ubuntu version but focused to the multimedia purposes. To do that task, it uses a Real Time (kind of Low Latency) Linux kernel. \nThe main differences between this kernel and the usual is that uses less time to response to a multimedia actions (in music is crucial to play and listen the sound that you are making in less than 10ms), but the overall performance is worse than the generic kernel (here an example: http://sevencapitalsins.wordpress.com/2007/08/10/low-latency-kernel-wtf)\nThen, if you want Ubuntu and Ubuntu Studio, both in the same SO (you don't want dual boot), you can install one OS (Ubuntu for example) and install all the packages of the other flavour over it like this:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop ubuntustudio-audio ubuntustudio-audio-plugins ubuntustudio-graphics ubuntustudio-video\n\nFrom https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu%20Studio%20Upgrade%20from%20Ubuntu\nAs a conclusion, you could have both operative systems installed as a one OS but you are able to work only with one kernel, the generic or the low-latency one (depending if you need performance or multimedia purposes), and you need to reboot when you want to change to the other (the same scene as if you have a dual boot system).\n\nA: Probably you just want the applications and the settings that Ubuntu Studio comes with, and not the desktop.\nIn that case do:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency ubuntustudio-audio\n\nIf you want other than audio applications, just install those too. You can find all of them by doing:\napt-cache search ubuntustudio\n\nFinally, you'll want to make sure the user is in audio group:\nsudo usermod -a -G audio $USER\n\n..and that audio group is handed realtime privilege. Make sure the file:\n/etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf\n\nis not named:\n/etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf.disabled\n\nIf it is, rename it.

Give some reliable answer.\n\nA: Two things i have found useful from community help and i will paste here. The full debugging link is here. here are the explanations I find relevant\n6. Is the sound card physically installed and recognized by your hardware?\nOpen a terminal and type\nlspci -v | grep -A7 -i \"audio\"\n\nThis should output some information about your audio hardware. An example is below.\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)\n        Subsystem: Toshiba America Info Systems Device ff01\n        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 22\n        Memory at dc440000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]\n        Capabilities: <access denied>\n        Kernel driver in use: HDA Intel\n        Kernel modules: snd-hda-intel\n\nMost people, especially laptop users, have a built-in sound card for their computer on the motherboard. If yours is built-in and isn't showing up in this step, then you probably need to enable it in your BIOS. When you first reboot your computer, there's usually a key sequence listed telling you how to enter the BIOS configuration screen. Since all BIOS's are differenct, you'll need to sort through your BIOS and enable the built in sound card. If you need help with this, you should ask at ubuntuforums.org.\nIf you are not using a built in sound card, and this step does not show your audio card, the card may be seated incorrectly on your motherboard, or may be bad or otherwise incompatible with your motherboard. You will probably want to test the card in another computer to see if it works there.\n7. Is my sound card supported by the Ubuntu sound system?\nUbuntu uses the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) for managing sound output. There is a listing of all of the sound cards supported by ALSA at http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main . You should look for the information that was listed by the command in the previous step. If it happens that your sound card is not supported by ALSA, you have two options: obtain a new sound card that is supported by ALSA, or contact the ALSA developers and request support for your sound card. \n", "Q: Arte - How to download rtmp or find the mp4 links So I've found this, the XML page for the video I want to download\nLiveweb\nand on that page there is this\nrtmp://arte.fcod.llnwd.net/a2306/o25/MP4:liveweb/stream/5030_Deca_Dance_25fps_La_Batsheva_24_images_hd.mp4?e=1385247600&h=a6f3d498e98f267cb4318f30d48479a0\n\nI thought I could stream/save this through VLC, but that doesn't work\nOr I thought I might be able to see a direct mp4 link in there but cant seem to do this either\nAny help appreciated\nThanks\n\nA: I use a python script based with rtmpdump command to download from Catalonian Television website (TV3).\nThis script fullfills the parameters of the command obtaining the data from the webpage where the video is posted, like this:\n\nrtmpdump -r rtmp://flash.dce.harvard.edu/bounce -C B:0 -C Z: \\\n-C S:/2012/02/22872/L01/22872-20120124-L01-1-h264-av1248-16x9-852x480.mp4 \\\n-C S:BounceAPI3.0 -C N:0.000000 -C S:mp4 \\\n-y mp4:2012/02/22872/L01/22872-20120124-L01-1-h264-av1248-16x9-852x480.mp4 \\\n-o a.flv\nRTMPDump v2.4-84-gdd57cd0\n(c) 2010 Andrej Stepanchuk, Howard Chu, The Flvstreamer Team; license: GPL\nConnecting ...\nINFO: Connected...\nStarting download at: 0.000 kB\n[...]\n3322.127 kB / 22.03 sec (0.3%)\n\n\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/528818/how-can-i-download-stream-videos-with-rtmp-protocol-from-harvard-extension-mor\n", "Q: unable to install mysql server on ubuntu the error I encountered while updating in ubuntu 11.10. since I found that ubuntu 11.10 supports much better than 12.04 for matlab, I have rebooted my OS to ubuntu 11.10.

The processing is done by a C++ plugin to which I'm passing the URL of the image.\nI can successfully save images and load them from the C++ plugin, but I'd rather not have to save the images on the filesystem first, and pass the in-memory camera preview to the plugin instead. \nGiven the URL for the preview that I'm getting from the camera (image://camera/preview_1), I'm guessing I should be able to get a reference to the \"camera\" image provider and then use the requestImage() method to get the image.\nHowever, I've not been able to figure out how to get hold of the camera image provider. Here's the code:\nQString Decoder::decodeImageQML(const QUrl &imgUrl)\n{\n    /* \n     * @imgUrl: URL to the camera preview. E.g. image://camera/preview_1\n     */\n\n    QQmlEngine * engine;\n    QQuickImageProvider *imageProvider = 0;\n\n    // FIXME: this does not work, I'm not sure how to get hold of \n    // the image provider\n    imageProvider = engine->imageProvider(\"camera\");\n\n    QImage image = imageProvider->requestImage((\"preview_1\", &size, QSize());\n\n    return Decoder::decodeImage(image);\n}\n\nHow do I get a reference to the camera image provider?\n\nA: You can get valid engine instance using following syntax.\nQQmlEngine *engine = QQmlEngine::contextForObject(this)->engine();\n\nAnd to get pointer of image provider, you can do something like following,\nQQmlImageProviderBase* imageProviderBase = engine->imageProvider(item.host());\nQQuickImageProvider* imageProvider = static_cast<QQuickImageProvider*>(imageProviderBase);\n\nAs QQuickImageProvider is derived from QQmlImageProviderBase, I think this cast is ok. Not sure how otherwise we can get pointer of QQuickImageProvider from engine.\n\nA: To get the preview image in C++, you should pass the mediaObject property of the QML Camera element to C++. You can see that code in the camera-app as example.\nYou could try to use the QCameraImageCapture with that mediaObject. But I'm not sure if that will work. But it has the imageCaptured signal you'll need. That has a QImage with the preview.\nvoid AdvancedCamera::setCamera(QObject *cameraObject)\n{\n    QVariant cameraVariant = cameraObject->property(\"mediaObject\");\n    QCamera *camera = qvariant_cast<QCamera*>(cameraVariant);\n    QCameraImageCapture *imageCapture = new QCameraImageCapture(camera);\n    QObject::connect(imageCapture, SIGNAL(imageCaptured(int, const QImage&))\n        myObject, SLOT(processPreview(int, const QImage&)));\n}\n\nIf it doesn't work, here is another way, using the QCameraImageCaptureControl of the QMediaService:\nvoid AdvancedCamera::setCamera(QObject *cameraObject)\n{\n    QVariant cameraVariant = cameraObject->property(\"mediaObject\");\n    QCamera *camera = qvariant_cast<QCamera*>(cameraVariant);\n    QMediaService *service = camera->service();\n    QMediaControl *control = service->requestControl(QCameraImageCaptureControl_iid);\n    QCameraImageCaptureControl *captureControl = qobject_cast<QCameraImageCaptureControl*>(control);\n    QObject::connect(captureControl, SIGNAL(imageCaptured(int, const QImage&))\n        myObject, SLOT(processPreview(int, const QImage&)));\n}\n\nYou should look a the code of the camera-app for a better example.\nFor getting the final image delivered as QVideoFrame in C++, you would need to set the captureDestination. But that's not (yet?) supported by the camera backend of the Ubuntu phones.\n", "Q: Remove duplicate python This morning I installed python3.3.2 from source, which is giving me some headaches, so now I want it removed. python3 launches python3.3.2, which is stored in /usr/local/bin. However, when I try to remove it, it wants to remove python3.3.1, stored in /usr/bin. I obviously want to keep this one. \n$ which -a python3\n/usr/local/bin/python3\n/usr/bin/python3\n\nHow do I get 'sudo apt-install remove python3' to not remove the necessary 3.3.1 /usr/bin one, and only 3.3.2 one in /local/bin? Thanks for any advice!\n\nA: Like you sad: You have installed python from source. If you want to remove this exact version you just build your own, you can't use the package-system because your python is not registered in this.\nIf python is the only software you installed by source with make install then it should be save just to delete everything under /usr/local/ because that folder is just for you ;-) (more info regarding that folder can be found in the File System Hierarchy Standard )\n$ sudo rm -r /usr/local/\n\nBut if you installed different software without the help of apt,dpkg or aptitude, that will be lost, too.

Before you go trying to find another drive, and you don't have anything important on the current drive, you can try Darik's Boot And Nuke. \nIts a utility that will completely erase your hard drive.  Its in ISO format, so one you download it, burn it to a CD, and boot from it, and just follow the onscreen instructions.\nOnce its done, try installing Ubuntu again.\nAlso, You can restart the installation, and select Something else create one partition format it as ext4 and mount it as /, and another one mounted as Swap.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Enable Wireless option is disabled in network settings in Ubuntu 12.04 My wireless connections have regularly disconnected with the Wireless option disabled in network settings.

With Ubuntu, you have the orange like theme that shows when you highlight something or click on something. That colour orange is very tacky. How can I change that colour to a colour like blue or make that colour translucent or even transparent.\n\nA: You can pretty much download a lot of themes from the Internet, but you can also install Cinnamon. Cinnamon is a fork of GNOME Shell used for Linux Mint. It is fully configurable. However, it is quite complicated to install at first, and it will replace Unity, so if you just wanted to change the basic theme, this may not be for you.\nTo proceed, open the terminal, and type in the following commands.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\n\nA: From the Dash, open System Settings or do a search for Appearance and open it.

But how about Nvidia?\nI know about Bumblebee and also know about new Nvidia 319 driver which must support Optimus.\nCan anybody suggest which driver to use? \n\nA: The nvidia-current package from the default Ubuntu repositories is the safest and most stable graphics driver to install, and it is also supported by Ubuntu software updates. The current version of nvidia-current for Ubuntu 13.04 is 304.88, and it works with Optimus. In 18.04 and later the nvidia-current package is no longer in the default Ubuntu repositories. Instead the following command will install the recommended proprietary Nvidia graphics driver and its dependencies automatically.\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall && sudo reboot\n\n\nA: I would recommend using Bumblebee for your Optimus. New Nvidia drivers (319) has a initial support of Optimus, but not GPU switching yet.\nThis guide will help you a lot: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/bumblebee-321-released-with-ubuntu-1304.html\nThere's also info's on Ubuntu's site: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\n", "Q: For more security: overwrite empty disk space I know it might seem a stupid question but I haven't come across any forum or post on the internet about:\n- What does \"overwriting an empty disk space\" mean/do? \n- Why doing that makes it more secure when encrypting a disk?\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: *\n\n*Overwriting empty disk space means to overwrite the space in a disk not in use by the file system, with either random content or zeros. \n\n*The reason is to make the data which still might be recoverable in this area practically irrecoverable.\n\nA: -I don't have the rep to comment-\nOverwriting unused disk space means that data is written to areas of the disk that are not currently being used by a file.  Overwriting unused disk space makes it more difficult to recover deleted files (yes they are still there after being deleted, even after the recycling bin is emptied).\nOverwriting unused disk space in an encrypted disk is more secure because if unauthorized access is gained to the encrypted disk, the data that was not overwritten is easily recoverable.\n", "Q: Why is /etc/network/interfaces ignored? I've been searching the internet for the last 2 hours and can't seem to find a solution to the following problem.\nI just installed Xen in a fresh Xubuntu 13.04 and in order to setup the networking, I had to remove network_manager. So, all network configuration is done through /etc/network/interfaces. At least, that's what should happen. However, it seems what I put in there is just being ignored: my xenbr0 interface doesn't get an IPv4 address assigned, there's no default gateway and no nameserver is setup.\nHere's what's in the /etc/network/interfaces file:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# There are no IP configurations for eth0, it’s all defined under xenbr0:\n#auto eth0\n\n# Static configuration\nauto xenbr0\niface xenbr0 inet static\n  bridge_ports    eth0\n  address         192.168.1.200 # the IP address of the Ethernet port\n  broadcast       192.168.1.255\n  netmask         255.255.255.0\n  gateway         192.168.1.1   # the address of the router\n  bridge_stp      off           # disable Spanning Tree Protocol - optional\n  bridge_waitport 0             # no delay before a port becomes available - optional, comment out if this gives you troubles\n  bridge_fd       0             # no forwarding delay - optional\n  dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1\n\nIn order to fix my network connection, I run a small \"fix\" script:\n#!/bin/bash\nifconfig xenbr0 192.168.1.200 netmask 255.255.255.0 up\nroute add default gw 192.168.1.1 xenbr0\n\nI would like to fix at the core though. Right now booting takes at least 1 minute extra, because the system waits for a working network connection.\nEdit: I also had to add the following to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base and run sudo resolvconf -u:\nnameserver 192.168.1.1\n\nWithout this I can only ping IP addresses, no DNS requests get passed through. This is actually what convinced me that the interfaces file is completely ignored.\nEdit 2: Doing either sudo restart networking or sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart doesn't do anything.\nEdit 3: Some extra info.

First of all, as suggested by Eric Carvalho, I uncommented auto eth0 in /etc/networking/interfaces. (Note that this is quite odd, several tutorials online seem to suggest this shouldn't be required for Xen.)\nThat by itself did not fix the slow boot though. It seems that on startup it still took a few seconds before the interfaces came up and in the meantime Ubuntu was already stuck in a 60 seconds idle wait. This I fixed by modifying the delay time in /etc/init/failsafe.conf from 60 seconds to 1 second. (I found out about this file through Google, no idea which one it was exactly.)\n\nA: You have:\naddress         192.168.1.200 # the IP address of the Ethernet port\n\nand report that this is the line that isn't working. Are you aware, from interfaces(5), that:\n   Lines starting with `#' are ignored. Note  that  end-of-line  comments\n   are NOT supported, comments must be on a line of their own.\n\nDid you add the end-of-line comments for the question, or do you actually have them in your /etc/network/intefaces file? If so, try removing them.\n", "Q: Installing updated BIOS for Dell 530s, keep getting \"insufficient memory\" error? I have tried using both virtual and real FreeDOS disks to load the file, but I can't get it to work- I run only Ubuntu 12.04 and I'm looking to upgrade my CPU, but every time I try to run the 530_1018.exe file on my FreeDOS flash disk, it expands it, says \"insufficient memory\" once it gets to the Award Bios Flasher, and deletes the expanded file. Any suggestions would be very helpful- thank you!\nP.S.-I am planning on adding 2 additional Gb of RAM, so if that will solve the problem, I don't mind waiting until that comes.\nEDIT: I opened it up, looks like a Foxconn G33M02 motherboard.\n\nA: Try this when you have installed the 2 GB RAM.

I updated the software, I installed the recommended proprietary drivers, installed any additional software that I wanted with no problems.\nHowever, I can't seem to change any system settings, they don't stick. I can access system settings, I can click on each option, but when I select an option to change it doesn't take. \nFor example if I click on Time and Date Settings and place a checkmark beside show weekday and date and month. It will place a checkmark beside those options but won't actually change in the menu. When I press the \"X\" to close out and go back into settings it's back to the default and the options I checked are unchecked.\nAlso happens with wallpaper, I can see all my wallpaper, but I select another wallpaper other than the default and it won't change. I turn on auto hide launcher and it doesn't auto hide. I change my shortcuts on the unity bar and when I restart my computer the settings don't stick they go back to the defaults.\nAny idea what I can do to fix this or why it is happening. Other than that everything is working.\nEdit, when I log out of my user account and into a guest session, I am able to adjust all system settings without issue. \nThanks\n\nA: I don't know if you eventually solved your problem, but I had the same problem after 'upgrading' to 13.04, and then downgrading back to 12.04.\nWhat worked for me, was to go into my home directory and remove all of my dot file and dot directories. I didn't test carefully for which one made it work, but do\n\ncd\nls -a\n\n.this\n.that\n.somethin\n.somethinelse\netc.\nOne of those is some how corrupted or unwriteable or something, and can't persist your changes. Depending on your knowledge and confidence, delete all the ones you don't care about, or delete them one-by-one until you find what works, or google each one before deleting it.\n\nrm -rf .this\nrm -rf .that\n\netc.\n\nA: I had the same issue after changing permission of my complete Home folder (sudo chmod -R 700 /home/user1) on Ubuntu 14.04.2. For some reason the problem only appeared for user1, but not for the second user (user2), although I changed permission for all user the same way. Besides I had  a forced restart after this Permission-change, so maybe this was the reason for my problem.\nAfter reading this thread I just restored the old permissions for /home/user1/.cache, .config and .compiz (sudo chmod -R 755 /home/user1/.c?). I started with .config, which restored my system settings but not my wallpaper. After doing the same to .compiz my wallpaper came back. At last I did the same with .cache, just to be sure.\nI will try a restart and a change to the \"new\" permissions (700), just to see, if it really depends on the permissions of these folders.\nEdit:\nI restated my computer with 755 permission and it kept all system settings. Then I changed back to 700 for complete /home folder, reboot again and still all settings are there.\nI don't know what exactly the problem was, but maybe for some others experiencing this problem it would help to change permissions of the three folders to get back access to there settings instead of deleting them, too.\n", "Q: How do I setup two cron jobs to run every night at 3:00 and 3:10?

I was wondering which factors decide an Ubuntu version to be LTS or non-LTS?\n\nA: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS\n\nA new LTS version is released every 2 years. In previous releases, a\n  Long Term Support (LTS) version had 3 years support on Ubuntu\n  (Desktop) and 5 years on Ubuntu Server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04\n  LTS, both versions will receive 5 years support. There is no extra fee\n  for the LTS version; we make our very best work available to everyone\n  on the same free terms. Upgrades to new versions of Ubuntu are and\n  always will be free of charge.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu releases are time-based, that means they follow a schedule of releasing every April and every October: \n\n\n*\n\n*What's the difference between a Long Term Support Release and a Normal Release?\nSo far, every 2 years in the Spring is an LTS release. At some point that's just the cadence we fell into and since an LTS is an important release being able to tell people and partners that \"the next LTS is in April 2014\" becomes a real nice thing to have. \nNow they just come every 2 years. \nSee also Eric's answer.\n", "Q: Change steam tray icon back to default I have used this blog article http://www.webupd8.org/2013/02/get-ubuntu-mono-icons-for-steam-ubuntu.html to change the default tray steam icon to the one used in the article for Ubuntu-mono-dark. now I cant seem to change back to the default icon. the icon which is used for Ubuntu-mono-dark clashes with my new theme, where I cant seem to see the steam icon very well.\n\nA: Have you tried this?\nsudo rm /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark/apps/48/steam_tray.png\nsudo gtk-update-icon-cache --ignore-theme-index -f /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark\n\nOr if you did the tutorial for the Light theme:\nsudo rm /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-light/apps/48/steam_tray.png\nsudo gtk-update-icon-cache --ignore-theme-index -f /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-light\n\nMaybe using the parameter --force in the gtk-update-icon-cache could help also.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 Clean install Pandora does not work Simply put pandora is not working this is the error they give me, \"We've encountered an error.

That's good.\nBut how do I replace the text?\nGeany seems to do it only in the file that's currently opened. How do you open all files in Geany where it finds the search string?\n\nA: *\n\n*Select all the files that you want to edit, and open them with Geany.\n\n*From the Geany menu select Search -> Replace.\n\n*A new Replace window will open up. Under the Replace All section select In Session as shown in the picture below. In this example I have chosen to globally replace the string \"search-text\" by the string \"replace-text\".\n\n*From the Geany menu select File -> Save All.\n\n*From the Geany menu select File -> Close All and close Geany, or select File -> Quit.\n\n\nThis is the way to replace text in multiple files in Geany. If you want to find all the instances of text in multiple files before you replace them, you can select Search -> Find from the Geany menu, and the file names and line numbers of the lines in the files containing the search term will appear in a list in the bottom pane of the Geany window. Any open tabs in Geany whose file names are not found in this list in the bottom pane of Geany can be manually closed one at a time, or you can leave all the tabs open since it doesn't make any difference to the result of your replace operation.\n\nA: You can do this by waiting for a plugin to appear in this sense, or by using the terminal. I think the second way is better for the moment. I will explain how.\nTo open all files, in which a specific string is found, from inside of a directory (and subdirectories) open Geany, select Terminal tab from Message Window and run next command inside:\ngrep -rHIF --exclude='/directory_path/*~' -- 'text_to_find' /bin/bash /directory_path/* | geany `awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[:]\"} {print $1}'`\n\nFor example, to open all bash scripts that I have in my /home/radu/bin directory with Geany, I run next command:\ngrep -rHIF --exclude='/home/radu/bin/*~' -- '#!/bin/bash' /home/radu/bin/* | geany `awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[:]\"} {print $1}'`\n\n\nTo open these files in a new instance of Geany without to load the previous session's files, use -is arguments for geany command:\ngrep -rHIF --exclude='/directory_path/*~' -- 'text_to_find' /bin/bash /directory_path/* | geany -is `awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"[:]\"} {print $1}'`\n\nNow that you have all the files that you need opened in a single session of Geany, press Ctrl+H to open the Replace dialog, insert the text to find, insert the text to replace and press In Session button:\n\n", "Q: Install all xorg-edgers updates?

Is it safe to install these updates? especially after installing the nvidia driver? I dont wana mess anything up.\nIf its not safe, is there a way to hide the updates?\nThank You :)\n\nA: As opposed to other answers to this question, the very PPA states that it should be used as a whole and NOT via individual packages (i.e. not pick individual updates, but install all of them).\n\n== Important notice ==\nThis PPA is currently meant to be used as a whole. Please do not individually install packages from it, add it to your sources and let your package manager pull in every update. The packages here build against each other and compile different features based on whats available at build time. Do not assume that because it lets you install a DDX with just the driver and libdrm update that it will work.

Instead of erasing the 2 GB pendrive I think I erased the 2TB external hardisk using the Startup Disk Creator. It took only less than 5 seconds for the startup disk creator to erase my 2TB external harddisk. Also when I open the affected external 2TB drive there are no files visible, but the properties of the disk shows 1.2TB of the space as used (same as the size of the data I had stored in it previously before accident). Please see this image. \nSo I believe that the original data is somewhere in broken/invisible formats inside the disk. That is my only hope. I don't have a alternate 2TB harddisk to take a backup or to perform testing. I can neither avail or afford one right now in my place. So I don't want to mess up further by choosing a wrong recovery method on the original affected disk. My clients would be mad to listen to these stories for delays in my current deliverable, but getting fired or loosing business is the least of my problems now. This external hardisk is more important and is everything I had in my life and career.\nTo recover the data, I have already gathered ideas about testdisk and photorec from this posting and several others in google. I didn't try any of them on the affected hard disk. But I did try both testdisk and photorec on other portable devices for testing purpose. For instance, I tested them on a pendrive and retrieved files like a broken pieces from postmortem. It will be of no use, if that is what the recovery tools can provide it will be too impossible for me to rearrange, rename and understand the data/files of total size which is around 1.5 TB. The data involves most possible formats of images, sounds, videos, scripts, programs, codes, design files etc.. Isn't there a way to just undo this accident (that took only 5 seconds) and get back all my files as it is? Because the properties of the external drive still shows 1.2 Tb as used and only 800 GB out of 2 TB as free.\nI would loose 10 years of my life's work, designs, programs, all critical files, projects and priceless family memories. I am a living dead if I can't get back my data. Most of the post with similar issues are dated 2012 or before, so I believe there should have been some technology improvements to undo this by now. I know I am foolish to have something that I considered worth more than my life in one single external Hard disk.

And I made this mess while using ubuntu's in-built Startup disk creator. Infact the hard-disk was only my backup and I used to have the working copies in my laptop. But my bad time, I had also crashed my laptop recently while I was trying to render an animation using Blender and this week I lost the main backup data in hard-disk too. I can never recover from this tragedy and I request that if anyone knows a solution to recover data and files from the 2Tb hard-disk data, please share me.\nPlease help!

I thought that was what I was supposed to do, but now I can't boot into Windows.\nWhen I try to boot into Windows, it tells me \"boot manager missing\" and then the screen turns into a collage of colors. I even tried to re-install Windows 7, but after the \"windows is loading files\" progress bar, it turns into a collage of colors again and nothing happens.\nThe only thing I can do is restart my PC and boot up Ubuntu. I'm thinking the only way to fix this is by formatting my HDD and re-installing Windows 7, but I would prefer to not lose all my files.\n\nA: You definitely haven't installed it into same partition as it would have deleted Windows.\nLinux uses a much better partition system which Windows can't use. When manually adjusting the partitions, rather then using automatic option offered, it is important to keep Windows as the first partition because Windows Boot Manager can't find its files if they are elsewhere. You do not need to format your disk, but that would be the quickest way.\nYou can skip the boring solution and jump to recommended way if you like.\nThe most effective way would be to swap partitions; it is very complex but possible. The longer but easier way is to copy content from Windows home directories into Ubuntu, then using some live distro (for example SystemRescueCD or GParted CD), you can do it using GParted to\ndelete the Windows partition and moving all the partitions to the right.  This will take your computer the whole day to go through.\nOnce done, reinstall Windows (only up to the stage where it wants to restart).\nNow use the live CD from which you installed your Ubuntu and install grub again.\nBoot into grub and copy your old home directory back.\nReboot and chose grub's entry for Windows and finish the Windows installation.\nNow the easy and recommended way:\n\n*\n\n*Install VirtualBox\n\n*copy the full contents of the Windows partition into it\n\nIf it doesn't start working straight away, make a new installation choosing not to format the drive in the process.\nDon't forget that instead of usual drivers you will need VirtualBox Guest Additions.\nNow you can remove the Windows partition.

What do I need to do to fix this?\n\nA: when starting ubuntu make sure the window of virtualbox is full screen. if it can achieve at least 800x600 xorg should start with vesa drivers.\nif it doesnt start the problem is somewhere else\nmake sure you have internet connection into virtualbox when installing it.\nAs far as I know ubuntu installs guest additions automatically (I had to remove them manualy)\n\nA: It can't hurt to try to install the X11 guest utilities for VirtualBox, in case they weren't installed automatically:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11\n\nIf they're already loaded, you'll just get a message like \"virtualbox-guest-x11 is already the latest version.\"\nFor good measure, reboot the VM after installing if you don't notice any immediate improvement. \n", "Q: how can i add programs to a startup disk Hello I am looking for a way to add additional code to a startup disk (beyond the basic iso.)\nSpecifically looking to add a mud client as i am using a startup disk because my harddive has died\nYES I am still mudding in 2013.. or more specifically still looking to play some sort of online game after playing lotro for years before my hard drive crash\n\nA: check rescuecd it was designed such a way as to make it easy to add other software. beware its build on mine beloved Gentoo, so you will have to do loots of compiling (emerging)\nmore info in rescuecd customization\nyou may see wether you can use similair method with ubuntuCD from step 4c using apt instead of emerge...\n", "Q: Booting from USB I created a bootable USB and booted from the USB drive, but I don't get the Ubunutu screen when the computer starts.  I get my usual windows desktop.  I don't get the welcome screen with the options like the instructions say is supposed to happen.  What do I do?\n\nA: If it is windows8 then disable secure boot in bios. If it is other windows version after changing boot order in bios, while starting select the second option \"Try ubuntu\". Then ubuntu will be booted.\n\nA: Upon startup/boot there is option a menu option or key to select the boot source.  What is happening is the boot order is probably CDROM and then Hard Disk and then finally the USB drive (or even a network boot).\nIf you want to change the order of boot, please go into your BIOS (typically F2 or F8 before WIndows starts to load) and modify the boot order (or it maybe referred to as startup order).\n", "Q: Can't run Second life firestorm viewer (32bit) in ubuntu 64 bit I'm trying to install a Second Life client called Phoenix Viewer. \nOn the first attempt, I got a message about X errors. I searched the net all I could see to fix 32 bit apps and run them under 64 bit Ubuntu was shared libraries issues, so I installed all libraries that I found suggested in all articles but the error persists. \nCan someone help or at least give me a hint on what to do?\nThis is my output (too long I know, but I thought I should include all info):\n

When I installed it using SteamInstall.msi with winetricks and wine it did give me an icon but it says this \nDetails: Failed to execute child process \"/usr/bin/steam\" (No such file or directory).\nAny ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: You seem to be suffering from a bit of Confusion. So you had steam (Linux version) installed. Then went and installed the windows version using wine. It looks like you then removed the Linux version. So now when you try to launch steam via icon, your actually trying to run the Linux version which is not installed anymore. \nSo here is my recommendation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Linux version again, and use it where you can.\n\n*Remove wine\n\n*Install CrossOver it's the same as wine (even made the same people it's just their supported version).\n\n*Install steam via a CrossTie\n\n*This will give you a Linux version of steam along side a windows version. You can (and should) use the Linux version for games that support it, like HL2, and use the windows version for games that do not have Linux versions like CIM2.\n\n\nNow as a fair note, I think crossover's support is worth it, but you can do it with wine, or Play on Linux, but there often more configuring an it's not as smooth (not to mention the lack of real support). \n", "Q: How to see the amount of free disk space in files browser with 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) Up to the previous Ubuntu versions you could easily switch on a status line at the bottom of the files browser, which showed useful infos like the amount of free disk space, number of files in directory, number of selected files and amount of data of selected files.\nHow do I get these informations with Raring Ringtail?\nsigh\nImagine you want to copy a 5 GB file to a USB drive or memory stick and the computer just says \"not enough free space\" - how should you know whether you have to delete just a few MB to make it fit or wheter the device is full? And when you multi-select files to copy or delete, do you then have to calculate by yourself?\nSoemtimes I really wonder how others are using their computer when a feature is removed that seems to be totally essential. Maybe they have tons of terabytes of hard disk drives and a couple of 64+ GB flash memory sticks so they never run out of free space.\n\nA: You need to switch file browsers or submit a bug to have the feature re-added. The maintainers of that project decided to remove it for some (IMO) nonsense reason that I will likely never be convinced of. \nRanting aside your only options are to find a fork where someone put it back, like nemo, use a different file manager (there are several), or complain a lot in bug reports and mailing lists till the maintainers put it back or allow you to put it back (it is opensource after all). \n\nA: A tad late, perhaps, but right-clicking in the directory and choosing the \"Properties\" option at least shows you the amount of free space on the device concerned. Although it is not, in my opinion, a desirable solution, it beats the disk usage analyzer option.\n\nA: This question Diskspace status bar missing after ubuntu 13.04 update talks about a way to solve the problem\n\"Just search in the the dash \"disk usage analyzer\" with out the quotes and open it up, it will show you how much space is used and how much is left for all of the storage devices plugged into the computer including the hard drive(s).\"\nI am however running KDE so I am unable to test if this solution works or not.

Most current Intel CPUs use the AMD64 architecture -- although of course Intel refuses to use that name. Other names for this architecture include x86-64, x64, and EM64T. In other words, the AMD64 version of Ubuntu is the right one to use for any mainstream 64-bit computer. (It'd be another story if you were using a computer with an ARM, Itanium, SPARC, or other CPU type.)\nSecond, I'm the maintainer of rEFInd, and I've received several reports from users of recent Macs to the effect that rEFInd doesn't work with them. It appears that Apple has done something strange with the video modes of these models, so rEFInd produces a blank display. Chances are the same is true of rEFIt and of GRUB (which Ubuntu uses by default). Unless/until I can get my hands on such a computer for debugging, or another developer does the same and submits a patch, the rEFInd problem won't go away. The same is probably true of other boot loaders. Given the fact that the problem exists in multiple boot loaders, and even in a very simple test program I created to help a user debug the problem, I'd say this qualifies as a bug in the firmware, although I'm sure Apple would dispute that claim and say they're using some new Apple-specific \"standard.\"\nMy best suggestion for a workaround is to try using BIOS mode to install Linux. Use Apple's Boot Camp to prepare your disk, then hold down the Option key while starting the computer with the Ubuntu disc inserted to get Apple's own boot manager. You should be able to boot the Ubuntu installer (probably mis-identified as Windows) into BIOS mode and do an install. You'll then need to use gptsync or gdisk to re-create the hybrid MBR. If this is entirely successful, you should be able to use the Option key at boot time to choose between booting OS X and Linux. If/when the firmware/video problem is overcome, you should be able to install a fixed boot manager and begin booting in EFI mode via the updated boot manager.\n\nA: I was able to use the new AMD64 Mac version of 13.04 and it just worked. I also have a 9,2 mbp. I tried following guides using rEFInd and was struggling to get anywhere. So I just decided to start all over and just try using the installer like I would on a windows PC. I removed rEFInd using the instructions on the site. I deleted all the other partitions that had been created and expanded the Mac OS X partition to full again.\n\n\n*\n\n*I used Disk Utility to create 50GB free space first. \n\n*Then booted holding ALT and selecting the thumb drive I had Ubuntu on. \n\n*Just followed the install and selected \"Install Ubuntu along side Mac OS X\". It chose what to do with the grub/boot install automatically.\n\n\nAfter a reboot, and holding ALT again to choose what to boot to, it shows a 50GB \"Windows\" partition to boot to for Ubuntu. But everything works.\nI had to enable wifi drivers after the fact, wifi at work doesn't play nice with Ubuntu for some reason.\n\nA: First, don't use rEFIt or rEFInd. Everybody says you need it for some reason, but I have no idea why. I recommend uninstalling rEFIt.\nSecondly, you need the amd64 ISO. Don't get scared off by the word 'amd', they are for Intel processors too.\nThirdly, you should do it with a LiveUSB. I do not recommend installing with a LiveCD because that causes a long startup time and heating issues (Because it then installs in BIOS mode, which is bad, instead of in EFI mode, which is good. LiveUSB's install in EFI mode.). With UNetbootin is easy to create one. Just plug in your USB stick (and unplug all other USB drives if you have them plugged in to.) Start up UNetbootin, select the ISO (I should do that instead of just choosing a distro from the dropdown menu's), and click OK. Wait until it's finished, ignore the message about that it's not bootable on a Mac, reboot your Mac while holding alt, and select the USB drive. The Ubuntu LiveUSB should boot now.\nLast but not least, if you have an NVidia graphics card and want to install the \"propietary drivers\" (Which I HIGHLY recommend if you have an NVidia card, otherwise you'll run into severe graphics performance issues), you will run into issues.\n\nA: Personal experience: \nI have downloaded the 64-bit mac Ubuntu Raring Ringtail 13.04. \nPartitioned my MacHD using Disk Utility.\nPut it on a USB and used Unetbootin to make it bootable.\nShut down my Macbook Pro 9,2 (OS X 10.8.5). \nInserted the USB. \nPressed alt (option) key and start button, Macbook sees my EFI (USB live) disk. \nChose 'Try Ubuntu without installing'. Then followed exactly what ChrisDeStefano shows here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYhdXHO_Hzg to partition on Ubuntu and create a swap area. Installed as shown in video. As the Ubuntu installation concluded I pressed restart.\nBecause my Macbook didn't see Ubuntu I tried installing rEFInd by downloading it on Mac, placing it on the desktop and using the terminal to install it as shown here: \nhttp://www.thatsthewayyoudoit.me/2013/04/how-to-install-ubuntu-1304-on-macbook.html\nShut down my Macbook and - lo and behold - rEFInd sees both Apple and Ubuntu.\nUpdated the system in Ubuntu, but I still have heating issue on the mac when using ubuntu and can't install Skype... apart from this Ubuntu works fine.\n", "Q: Changing the torrent programm for magnet URL for the moment I'm downloading torrents via magnet sing Transmission, when the first time I was asked by chromium to open the magnet URL, I choosed Transmission and I checked the Remember my choice for all links of this type.\nNow I want to change the default torrent program for Magnet URL I want to open them using KTorrent.\nHow can I do that ?\n\nA: A few things from this thread:\nChromium - or any other browser - doesn't choose which application to use for launching any external application.

You basically find the line in your state file, delete it, and that makes the popup show again.\n\nA: You can use xdg-mime:\nxdg-mime default KTorrent.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet\n\nA: another option is to try to change this through the torrent client settings, e.g in BitTorrent press the settings icon on the middle right, then simply click associate with torrent files worked like a charm..\n", "Q: I encountered a dpkg dependency issue, and how do I resolve this issue? sudo apt-get -f install\nReading package lists...

Nothing.\nI tried several of the guides around the web all relating to a live CLI and installing GRUB. I have tried several times and no luck. I get a sucesfull install to sda. minus the sector 32 flexnet error. \nWhen I try to boot I get error: no such device: (UUID that dosent match) and then I am at grub rescue. I have 5 drives, all installed in the same order in the BIOS. 4 of them are linux LVM. If i try to boot from one of them I get a nice error message warning me. So I know I am booting to the right device.

The one that is coming up at the boot error does not match any of the drives and does not match the ones in the grub.cfg\n\nA: The BIOS had a IDE emulator setting for the sata drives. This caused confusion in grub because It was trying to communicate with the sata directly rather than the emulated IDE. \n", "Q: Unity Panel Disappeared After Losing My Home Folder I had my home folder on it's own virtual disk that got corrupted and I lost the data on it. I was able to recreate my home folder in the same place, but now when I log into Ubuntu I get an empty screen and then I have to run ctrl-alt-t to get a terminal and then unity --reset to get the unity panel back and then all is well.  How can I fix things so I get the panel when I log in?  I'm running 12.04\n\nA: The problem is solved although I'm not sure what caused it.  It was quite simple; at the password prompt to log in, just above and to the right is an icon to choose the login options.  That was set to 'User Defined Session'.  By simply choosing Unity instead I was able to log in and the unity panel displays as normal.  I never created any kind of user defined session in the past that I know of but after choosing the Unity option just one time it's now become the default, so everything is back to normal.\nThanks Superaxander\n\nA: Try reseting you're home directory. \nSteps:\nFirst type this in terminal\nsudo nano /etc/passwd\nThen when you find yourself(you're user) it will look a bit like this:\njack:x:1000:1000:Jack,,,:/home/jack:/bin/bash\nChange the /home/jack to a new place for you're home directory.\njack:x:1000:1000:Jack,,,:/mynewhome:/bin/bash\nMake sure the folder you choose exists!\nPress ctrl+x and then y and enter\nYou might need to relog or reboot but I don't know\nHope it helped!\nCheers\n", "Q: How can I use an ATI Radeon HD 6450 on Ubuntu 13.04? Basically, I get a orange/purple/black flickering screen when I try to boot Ubuntu 13.04 with my AMD Radeon HD 6450 without the proprietary drivers, but cannot install the driver from the website without having the graphics card installed.\nHow, then, could I use my graphics card and install the drivers, despite the flickering screen?\nP.S. I tried to go into tty, that only gave me a blank screen.\n\nA: You could try using \"nomodeset\" boot parameter to boot Ubuntu, install the drivers and boot normally.\nWhat is nomodeset?\nTo add boot parameters temporary at the grub boot menu press “e” while certain menu entry is select. Boot parameter should be added to the end of the line where it says \"quiet splash\" and to boot with these settings press f10. You can find more guides for setting boot parameters from grub here.\nAt least you should be able to use command line then. Here are some guides about installing AMD drivers from command line.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a Lenovo Ideapad S405 I installed Ubuntu on an S405 ideapad after disabling UEFI boot and enabling legacy support.\nThe most important problem is that while i get about 3-4  hours battery backup on windows, Ubuntu tells me immediately after unplugging from the power supply that there is something wrong with the battery and puts the laptop in hibernate mode. It does not allow me to disable this.\nIn addition, the S405 has a weird fn key that has to be pressed along with the function keys to make the function keys work, otherwise just pressing the function keys will run some functions like muting/increasin or decreasing volume/brightness etc. There is supposed to be an option in the bios to change this, according to the documentation, but its not there in my laptop. Is there anyway in Ubuntu that i can change these mapping?\n\nA: Regarding the function key, disable hot key in bios.\n\nSetting hotkey mode \nBy default, the hotkey functions are accessible by pressing the\n  appropriate hotkey. However, you can disable the hotkey mode in the\n  BIOS setup utility. \nTo disable the hotkey mode:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Restart the computer. When the Lenovo logo appears, immediately\n  press Fn + F2 to enter the BIOS setup utility.\n  \n*In the BIOS setup utility, open the Configuration menu, and change\n  the setting of HotKey Mode from Enabled to Disabled.\n  \n*Exit Saving Changes.\nNote:When hotkey mode is disabled, press the Fn key and the\n  appropriate hotkey to access the corresponding hotkey function.

That is the correct file for your device. I recommend you check the md5 sum or try re-downloading it. the image would not be in the current directory if it would not install because it would not have passed automated testing.\n\nA: The reason you are encountering this issue is because you need to run the zip file from  Ubuntu's recovery image. The reason you are encountering an assert failed is because the recovery software (i.e. Clockworkmod) you are using doesn't recognize 'getprop' as a valid function. You'll need to find the correct recovery image file that corresponds with the zip file you're trying to install.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 No USB sound output for Audiolab Q-DAC Recently I upgraded my sound system from using mobo's internal audio output to USB2.0 by connecting to a USB DAC (Audiolab Q-DAC).

How to do so?\n\nA: If you look at the answers to this question, it may provide some pointers:\nHow do I install an older 2.6.37 Kernel Version?\nAs far as I can work out, if you go into the Grub menu at start up, just after the BIOS screen, you then have a number of options for booting.\nIf your Grub menu does not show when you boot up, then the simplest way to display your Grub is to press and hold the SHIFT button while booting.\nAs an alternative, you can always displays Grub without it booting any particular kernel:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nchange grub_timeout to -1\nfinish off by running\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Does the Ubuntu 13.04 disk image fit on a CD? I am currently out of blank DVD's so my question is: Can I burn the iso to a CD instead or does it have to be a DVD?\n\nA: Not directly answering your question but perhaps another approach for you (or someone who stumbles upon this) to consider:\nGiven that some distros are going to be too large for a simple cd:\nIf your machine can boot from pen drive, if you have access to a windows box - you can easily get many distros onto pen drive with LinuxLive USB Creator\nA slightly more wordy approach if you dont have a win box:\nInstall Ubuntu from USB Stick\n\nA: It depends what release you are planning to install, if you're installing earlier versions than 12.10 then you can use a CD, however for releases 12.10 or later: \n\nUbuntu 12.10 will increase the maximum size of its disc image from\n  700MB to 800MB, thereby making it too big to fit onto traditional CD-R\n  media.\nThe news came from Canonical’s Kate Stewart on the Ubuntu Mailing list, who\n  wrote:\n\nThere  is no longer a traditional CD sized image, DVD or alternate\n    image, but rather a single 800MB Ubuntu image that can be used from\n    USB or DVD.\n\nUbuntu Server remains unaffected by the switch.\n\nAnd as such CD's aren't typically able to store over 700MB of data so if you're planning on installing releases after 12.04, you'll have to either go with the USB options as suggested in the other answers, or you're stuck with having to buy a DVD.\nSource and more info the matter: OMG Ubuntu: The Ubuntu LiveCD is dead\n\nA: You can't burn Ubuntu 13.04, or 12.10 ISO to a CD  without first modifying the ISO.  It would only fit on a DVD, since the ISO file size is almost 800MB.  What you can do is make a bootable USB flash drive.\nYou can use UNetbootin to create the USB.  For more information on how to install Ubuntu, and other ways that you can create bootable media for installation see Install Ubuntu 13.04\n\nA: You can burn the Ubuntu 12.04 ISO successfully to a CD, but the ISOs of Ubuntu 12.10 and later Ubuntu releases are too large for a CD, so you have to use a DVD instead or create a live USB Startup Disk. There are several ways to create an Ubuntu live USB Startup Disk. The easiest way to do it is by using the built-in Startup Disk Creator application.\n\nA: Given that the ISO file is almost 800MB, you cannot use a regular CD-R. However there are  CD-Rs that were prepared for overburning, that is—writing data outside the regular space that is usually being read. Such overburnt CDs might not work with every optical disk reader though, but will be able to store more data. You need a special CD-R too, one that follows the CD-R99 standard.\nIf you use Brasero, it should show you a message about turning overburning on when you try to burn such an image.\nNote that since the introduction of DVDs, this is basically asking for troubles—not every cd reader will accept such a drive, error rate might be bigger etc.\n\nA: That depends on the kind of blank CDs you have. \nThe most commonly used have a capacity of 700 MB, but you can also get blank CDs with a capacity of 800MB or 900 MB.\nFor the LTS-version 12.04 you need at least 700MB, but for the more recent version 13.04 Version you'll need at least 800MB.\nThe capacity of your black CD should be written on the CD and/or on the package.\nWhen you are out of DVDs you can also use an USB flash drive, which might be the easiest solution.\nIn ubuntu you can use the the tool usb-creator-gtk for that and on windows i recommend: http://www.linuxliveusb.com/\n\nA: No, I have tried it two days ago. You will need a DVD. Anyway, a computer that has only a CD-ROM and not a DVD-ROM is probably too old for Ubuntu 13.04 and it will be very slugish unless you change the unity to some faster gui. On my old HP notebook (at least 4 years old) with 1GB RAM and 2GHZ CPU it's not very fast. And sometimes I am unable to do anything for 10-20 seconds or more seconds when I do something like updating and playing youtube video at the same time. \n\nA: Newer builds of Ubuntu will no longer fit on a CD as Ubuntu decided to include more \"space\" for its developers to include more packages (Programs/apps) in the image as previous builds required for a stripped down build for CD and a bigger build for DVD. The change allows developers to have to only maintain one image and reduce testing. If your computer only has a CD drive, why not try using an USB or a DVD drive instead? Also, it is important to note that unless your computer is your own recent DIY build that didn't use a DVD drive to save costs, most older computers that don't even have a DVD drive should be too slow to even handle Ubuntu 13.04, and it may be better to use an older LTS image that can fit on a CD. \n\nA: If you're able to provide a network connection to the installation target, you can use the Minimal CD that is only 30MB large. Of course, the installer has to download everything later so this may not be appropriate for your needs.\n\nA: 12.04 was the last Ubuntu release to be made available with an iso that would fit on a CD. \nSource: omgubuntu.co.uk\n\nA: Another Option is to burn the 13.04 netboot installer to a CD and then install via internet or from a local network location:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/13.04/\n", "Q: screen brightness reduction software? i'm a total new user of ubuntu.

One fault with this method is simple: it can't be done if more than a half of the current partition is already used.\nSo I'm looking for a solution that wouldn't delete my data, and just change the partition format from FAT32 to NTFS. Is something like that possible or not?\n\nA: As Rinzwind stated, \n\nit is not possible unless you use Windows.\n\nNow that being said, even if you have windows, you have to be careful when doing it.\nYou have to move the drive to another machine in order to be able to accomplish that, since you can't convert a live volume. \nThe command to use to do the conversion is:\nconvert <drive_letter>: /FS:NTFS\n\nNote: Always keep in mind that when dealing with anything to do with partitions, make sure that you have a current backup, in case something goes wrong.\n\nA: first go to the drive in windows (I am going to use Z as my drive letter) cmd.exe\nz:\nthen return\nchkdsk /f\n\nthen return\nthen do a convert of the drive\nconvert z: /FS:NTFS\n\nagain return\nyou will have to allow the unmounting of the drive during those processes.\n", "Q: How to remove windows I want to remove windows and delete it's partition.

It happens both in normal booth (removing quiet splash) and when trying recovery mode.

But when I run apt-get upgrade it will fail to boot on the next boot, in both normal and recovery mode. I have resinstalled the system several times, and the same behaviour appears after the upgrade.\nWorkaround\nThe curious thing is that if I enter the system setup (UEFI/BIOS-screen), and then select the Ubuntu UEFI boot option, the system boots every time. But if I let the system boot normally, it won't boot. The option I select manually is the same option as the one to boot automatically.\nNaturally, I would like to not have to enter the setup every time I use my system. Any idea what could be wrong?\n\nA: It sounds like you've run into a kernel-specific bug. Such things are not unheard-of. The closest I know of is this bug under discussion on the Arch Linux forum. It's been difficult to track down, but my suspicion is that the bug the Archers have found isn't the same as yours, since their bug manifests only when using the EFI stub loader, whereas you're presumably using GRUB. (Then too, if you're not using GRUB, you should tell us what you are using!)\nMy recommendation is to try another boot loader. There's a chance that it will enable you to bypass the bug, or at least select your old working kernel. Several alternatives are available, but my personal preference is rEFInd, since I maintain it and am therefore very familiar with it. The procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a boot loader.\n\n*Install and test your boot loader.\n\n*For added safety, back up the /boot/vmlinuz-{version} and /boot/initrd.img-{version} files, as well as the /lib/modules/{version} directory, where {version} is your current working kernel version.\n\n*Upgrade your system.\n\n\nIf at this point, if you can boot into your new kernel using the new boot loader, you can put it down to a GRUB bug or a GRUB/kernel incompatibility. If the new boot loader doesn't let you boot the new kernel, try using it with the old one. If that works, then it's almost certainly some variety of kernel bug, and you can just keep using the old kernel. Keep backups, though; I'm not sure about Ubuntu, but some distributions keep only a certain number of kernels around, and so will delete your working kernel after enough kernel upgrades are pushed out.\n", "Q: Issues about insalling Cinelerra video editor?

You can try some fixes in case that your BIOS is blocking it and the BIOS has KVM enabled:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*On some hardware (e-g HP nx6320), you need to power-off/power-on the    machine after enabling virtualization in the BIOS.\n  \n*Enabling some BIOS features may break VT support on some hardware    (e-g Enabling Intel AMT on a Thinkpad T500 will prevent kvm-intel\n  from loading with \"disabled by bios\")\n  \n*On some Dell hardware, you also need to disable \"Trusted Execution\",    otherwise VT will not be enabled.\n  \n\nhttp://www.linux-kvm.org/page/FAQ#.22KVM:_disabled_by_BIOS.22_error\n\nA: In my case, an IBM T60, it was a bios-setting about the CPU, that had to be enabled. \"When enabled, a WMM can utilize the additional hardware capabilities provided by Intel (R) Virtualization Technology.\"\n\nA: To enable KVM capability for a Toshiba Portege R705-P35, go to the BIOS's Advanced page, then, for the \"Virtualization Technology\" setting, select \"VT-⁠x Only\".\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_(VT-x)\n", "Q: Updated version 12.04 & now GRUB line command needed; tab shows many unknown possibilities My desktop for both operating system is dead in the water until the right GRUB command is entered.

Is there a way to install the latest release of a program other than building it from the source?\nI know that the packages/applications in the ubuntu repositories are not always containing the most recent versions of programs to ensure best system stability. However, I would like to have a newer version of the program \"Okular\". They already released one last October but it is still not upgraded in the repositories.\nIs there a way to get it with apt-get? Maybe adding some other \"unstable\" repositories or using a special parameter?\n\nA: The official Ubuntu repositories are maintained by a group of human beings. Because they need time to check each application for updates and pack them for distribution, they tend to be generally behind the curve. Stability is slightly less important.\nTo get bleeding-edge versions, you can build them from source or download the package from their site (if they offer one, I see Okular doesn't), but there is a way that you can use apt for certain programs. Launchpad allows users to create their own apt repositories that packages can be downloaded from. Packages downloaded from these are likely to update much faster than the Canonical archives because the developer will update it themselves when they make it.\nUnfortunately, although Okular is on Launchpad, it doesn't have this. https://launchpad.net/okular\nYou might be able to convince them to make one, but otherwise I think activating the pre-released packages, as Radu proposed, is your best option.\n\nA: Go to System settings > Software & Updates, select Updates tab and check Pre-released updates.\n\n\nA: Try this:\nStart Terminal Ctrl + Alt + T\nType in:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nWait for that to finish then type in:\nsudo apt-get install\n\nThis should install any updated packages which are available.\nIf you just want to update Okular type in\nsudo apt-get install okular\n\nor\nsudo apt-get update okular\n\n\nA: Okular - KDE\nThe Okular is part of the KDE: http://okular.kde.org/\n\nFebruary 6, 2013: Okular 0.16 released The 0.16 version of Okular has\n  been released together with KDE Applications 4.10 release...\n\nKDE 4.10.3 is available for the...\nBy the Kubuntu.org: May Updates to KDE Plasma and Applications - http://www.kubuntu.org/news/kde-sc-4.10.3\n\nPackages for the release of KDE SC 4.10.3 are available for Kubuntu\n  13.04, 12.10 and 12.04. You can get them from the Kubuntu Updates PPA for 13.04 and from the Backports PPA for 12.10 and 12.04...\n\nThe KDE SC 4.10.3 is now in the Ubuntu Proposed and hopefully moving soon to the Ubuntu Updates: http://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?62666-Kde-4-10-3\n", "Q: Partially overwrite in a file through script I see\n<command> >> <filepath> appends the command line to the file\nand\n<command> > <filepath> replaces the entire contents of the file with the command given passed.\nHow to pass the command to the file so that only the last line of the file is overwritten?\n\nA: That's not built in to the shell in the same way simple overwrite and append are. You have to do it in two steps, first remove the last line, then append:\nX=$(head -n -1 filepath)\necho \"$X\" > filepath\ncommand >> filepath\n\nOr you can overwrite with the new contents all at once:\nX=$(head -n -1 test)\n(echo \"$X\"; command) > test\n\nNote that in both cases, we capture the old lines that we want to keep in a variable first as a separate command. This is because as soon as a command with a \">\" directive begins executing, the shell will clear the file, and any attempt to read those lines will be too late.\n", "Q: How to install gcc-4.3 for NS2 I want to install NS2 in Ubuntu.\nI run the below command:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libxmu-dev gcc-4.3 \n\nBut I got an error:\nPackage gcc-4.3 is not available\n.\n.\n.\nE: Package 'gcc-4.3' has no installation candidate.\n\nCould you please provide me how to install gcc-4.3 [Step-by-Step]??\n\nA: Install the metapackage gcc. This will automatically install the latest available version of gcc, so you won't need to worry about the details. If you need an outdated version for this particular program to build, gcc-4.4 is the oldest you can get through the package manager.\nTo clarify, that's sudo apt-get install gcc or sudo apt-get install gcc-4.4\nI'm not aware of any archives that have the particular 4.3 release that you're looking for. I am assuming that any version will work just as well, and that NS2 merely provided old build instructions.\n", "Q: Could someone tell me whether my OS is communicating with the internet? I edited iptables so that when the VPN service is disconnected, no program will access the internet.\nWell, I did an experiment. I disconnected the VPN service manually and immediately did a ping by issuing the following command:\nsudo ping www.yahoo.com\n\nBelow are the results:\nPING ds-any-fp3-real.wa1.b.yahoo.com (206.190.36.45) 56(84) bytes of data.\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\n^C\n--- ds-any-fp3-real.wa1.b.yahoo.com ping statistics ---\n8 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 7056ms\n\nWas any data including geolocation information sent out from my computer and received by the destination party during the ping session?\n\nA: I think you're worried about the 8 packets transmitted message.\nThe ping application generates packets and submits them to the kernel for processing. Those are the \"transmitted\" packets reported in ping statistics. When packets enter the iptables' chains they can be accepted, dropped or rejected.\nPing says sendmsg: Operation not permitted because packets sent by the application were not accepted. So the answer is no, packets sent by ping didn't leave your computer.\nBut, as said by Alaa, you pinged www.yahoo.com and the name was successfully resolved to an address (206.190.36.45). This only happens if your computer sends a DNS query and receives a reply or if the name is in the DNS cache, which shouldn't happen by default (thanks @Alaa).\nAre you sure all the traffic is blocked if VPN is disconnected? Maybe you didn't block DNS. You should only accept output traffic destined to your VPN gateway.\n", "Q: Alternative to LibreOffice Base for Ubuntu Is there a database management software for Ubuntu alternative to LibreOffice Base?\nLObase works fine for a while, but occasionally the files I'm working on get corrupted and I lose all my work.\n\nA: Try Kexi.\n\nKexi is an open source visual database creator, a long-awaited competitor for programs like MS Access or Filemaker.\n\nIt is part of the Calligra Suite (but can be used completely independently).\nTo install from the software center:\nKexi \nFrom the command line:\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.\n\n\n*When it opens, run the following command:\n sudo apt-get install kexi\n\nFor more information, or to download Kexi, see the Kexi website\n\nA: You can try Glom. It's a complete database system like FileMaker Pro (or Access).\n\nWith Glom you can design table definitions and the relationships between them, plus arrange the fields on the screen. You can edit and search the data in those tables, and specify field values in terms of other fields. It's as easy as it should be. The design is loosely based on FileMaker Pro, with the added advantage of separation between interface and data. Its simple framework should be enough to implement most database applications. Without Glom these systems normally consist of lots of repetitive, unmaintainable code.\n\nTo install from the software center:\nGlom \nFrom the command line:\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.\n\n\n*When it opens, run the following command:\n sudo apt-get install glom\n\nFor more information, see the Glom website\n\nA: Since the reason for looking for an alternative was data corruption, here's another option: use LibreOffice Base with a split-database configuration, instead of with the default embedded datatabase.\nBy default Base uses HSQLDB (v1.8) combined with the Base configuration in a zip file. This bundling of database structure and data with other settings makes the file susceptible to data corruption.\nInstead, you can convert existing databases to a split-database configuration, and/or start new projects with a split-database wizard which uses HSQLDB (v2.3).\nThe split-database configuration requires macro functionality to be enabled.\n\nA: I just found out about\nTablePlus\nThe best one I found yet for connecting to a server and editing simple databases with a simple GUI.\nCurrently free for Linux (not floss tough).\nKexi is great too, but according to the FAQ, it cannot use an existing database because it needs to store metadata in the database also.\n", "Q: Apply iconv to all of the files in a directory While trying to convert a collection of .srt files:\niconv -f cp1256 -t utf-8 directory/* > target/*\n\nit converts all of the 22 files in the directory to one file in the target directory called *.

I noticed that Firefox 21 doesn't work in Ubuntu 12.04 (I upgraded Ubuntu recently). It pops up a message which says: \"Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible\". I was looking for a solution and nothing worked for me. So I downloaded Firefox 20.0.1 (the .tar file), I installed it and it works, but I don't know how to install it properly. I mean, when I install Firefox from the terminal or Ubuntu Software Centre it appears in the panel with its icon and all that. But installing it from the .tar file is just paste the extracted folder in some direction (in my case /opt/firefox/firefox) and to run Firefox I need to go to that direction and clicking in the firefox file. What I really want to know is how can I install Firefox so it seems to be as installed from terminal or Ubuntu Software Centre, I mean, with its appropriate icon in the panel, and with the possibility to running it from terminal using the \"firefox\" command. Or if necessary, in which system folder should I paste the extracted folder?\n\nA: I think you're better off figuring out why Firefox 21 isn't working for you.

The fan is too noisy.\nAfter starting the Laptop, the fan starts and is not stopping or changing the revolutions at all. Still I didn't install any Windows just because the Laptop is new. What should I do: return the Laptop or will updating the BIOS will solve the Problem? I saw that there is a newer version of the BIOS: AO7.\n\nA: I suggest you to use i8kutils, a collection of utilities for Dell laptops. In this collection there is i8kmon, which is the utility I'm actually using right now.\nHow To solve Dell laptops fan issues in Ubuntu\n\n*\n\n*First of all, let's download and install i8kutils. Open your terminal and write:\n\nsudo apt-get install i8kutils\n\n\n*Now you've got to add i8k to your modules. Open the modules file:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/modules\nand add the string \"i8k\" (without quotes) to the file. Save and exit.\n\n\n*Create an i8k.conf file\nsudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/i8k.conf\nand fill it with this code:\noptions i8k force=1\nNote: Some older guides will tell you to create a /modprobe.d/options file. The \"options\" file isn't used anymore on Ubuntu. What does matter is that you create a file with a .conf extension (the filename isn't important, but I decided to name it i8k.conf for clarity). So beware of older i8kmon configuration guides.\n\n\n*Now restart your computer, or run this code to make i8k run:\n\nsudo modprobe i8k force=1\n\n\n*We will now create a i8kmon.conf file which will tell the i8kmon utility how to behave.\n\nsudo gedit /etc/i8kmon.conf\nPaste the following code in it:\n    # Run as daemon, override with --daemon option\n    set config(daemon)      0\n     \n    # Automatic fan control, override with --auto option\n    set config(auto)        1\n     \n    # Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option\n    set config(verbose) 1\n     \n    # Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option\n    set config(timeout) 20\n     \n    # Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n    set config(0)   {{-1 0}  -1  40  -1  40}\n    set config(1)   {{-1 1}  30  60  30  60}\n    set config(2)   {{-1 2}  53  128  53  128}\n     \n    # For computer with 2 fans, use a variant of this instead:\n    # Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n    # set config(0) {{-1 0}  -1  52  -1  65}\n    # set config(1) {{-1 1}  41  66  55  75}\n    # set config(2) {{-1 1}  55  80  65  85}\n    # set config(3) {{-1 2}  70 128  75 128}\n     \n    # end of file\n\nThis has been edited to match my Dell Inspiron 15r 5521 fan configuration (and I hope I did it well). If you want more informations take a look at the documentation on Ubuntu Manuals: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/i8kmon.1.html\n\n\n*Now you should be able to run i8kmon from your terminal and see if (and how) it's working.

(xfce4 is still GTK2 and hence agnostic of GTK3)\nIf ubuntu tweak is too heavy, you can also manually edit /etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\nMine looks as follows:\n\n[Settings]\ngtk-theme-name = elementary\ngtk-icon-theme-name = elementary-xfce\ngtk-fallback-icon-theme = gnome\ngtk-sound-theme-name = ubuntu\ngtk-icon-sizes = panel-menu-bar=24,24\ngtk-font-name = Droid Sans 9\n\nAlso, if you don't want to change the default gtk3 theme for all users, edit:\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n", "Q: Big issue in Ubuntu 13.04 I just installed Ubuntu 13.04. First I tried to just run the DEMO, but it was really slow, so I decided to just install it immediately. I cleared all previous files, deleting Windows, and got Ubuntu installed.\nMy issue is basically that Ubuntu does not work as it should at all.\nFirst of all the start-up is incredibly slow. Takes about 1 minute, whilst last time I used 12.04 and 12.10 it took about 5-10 seconds.\nSecond issue is that the whole interface is really, really buggy. Programs I open can not be minimized; well, they can, but just disappear (yet still running, so I can not re-open them.. firefox e.g). In addition to this, when I open a program I can not click in it with my cursor at all, until I Ctrl+Alt+Delete and hit ESC twice. Problem is that once I can actually click within that specific window, I can not click anywhere else until I close it completely (which I have to do with Alt+F4, because I can not even click the top-bar with the close, maximize & minimize buttons).\nOnce I have even touched the bar on the side (with the programs) I can never touch the desktop, nothing happens; neither right-click nor left-click, and I am unable to ever click the icons in top-right corner of the screen to turn off/restart computer etc.\nA lot of issues, I know, but hopefully someone can help me. Perhaps it is a faulty install disc? Burnt it today, so I am unsure.\n\nA: These symptoms seem very odd. If you think it could be a disc problem, you should try installing from a USB stick. You might also want to download the disc image again because it may have been corrupted somehow.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 After installation (D drive and E drive in Windows System) are missing!

If you have the time and expertise to do that go to Launchpad Blueprints, there you will be able to receive help from other developers. You will need to know what you are doing ; they won't do the work for you.\nBut if you don't have time and expertise you can use Ubuntu Brainstorm, as Leopoldo already pointed out. This idea already exists there: Ubuntu login fade-in.\nAlso you can file a bug at Launchpad requesting the feature and it will be marked as Wishlist, and depending how many users mark the bug as affecting them, the feature might end up being released by the Ubuntu team.\n\nA: There's no \"fade in\" effect for login in Unity/Compiz yet, as KDE does, but you can promote the idea to implement it in next milestones. Is posted here for long time:\nhttp://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/28471/\nHope that this helped you.\n", "Q: Using RGB cable to view movies on tv When I use an RGB cable to connect my laptop to the Vizio TV I can only see the desktop, no folders or any other activity.

It works without any additional help through Windows, but I don't want to use Windows!\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nA: I expect you are running two monitors, and you aren't \"mirroring\", that is, they are set to be one wide monitor rather that two copies of the same monitor.\nI use arandr to set my dual monitors. You can install it and find it with dash. You can play with it a bit and see if you get both monitors showing the same thing, or perhaps you'll find showing the video on the TV whale leaving the laptop monitor free for other things is useful.\n", "Q: can not open software center abdul@abdul-Inspiron-3521:~$ software-center\n2013-06-02 21:53:50,082 -

That said..\nThat Dell is an old system (c. 2002) and I would recommend using an alternate 32-bit distribution such as Lubuntu or Xubuntu that have leaner DE's (Desktop Environments) than Gnome. I might lean towards Xubuntu using the 12.04 LTS release as this will have current security updates available for a few more years; Lubuntu does not offer an LTS version at this time.\n\nA: It's quite old, according to the specs. Ubuntu with GNOME might not run very well esp. since this machine seems to be limited to 1 GB RAM.\nXubuntu (using XFCE) should work reasonably well.\n\nA: For older low specific computers you can try:Xubuntu\n Or try to use different distro like: puppy linux (or) Linux lite.\nLinux Lite is free for everyone to use and share, and is suitable for people who are new to Linux or for people who want a liteweight environment that is also fully functional.

Maybe I should add some configuration on the server side? Please help.\nThanks.\n\nA: We discussed this in a chat room here, however this is the brief summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have a domain name.\n\n*Make sure that the domain points to your provider's name servers.\n\n*Make sure that an A record exists (for IPv4) in the provider's name servers which points your domain to the correct IP for your VPS.  If it's an IPv6 address, use an AAAA record.\n\n*Make sure that nginx has a server_name line in the configuration for the server { block which has the domain name in it.\n\n\nAnd you're done.\nTo add additional sites in nginx, make additional server { blocks in the configuration file with the relevant configuration data, after making sure the domain points to the IP address for your server, and that the server_name lines contain the domain name(s) in that line for each relevant site root directory on the server.\n", "Q: How to change dash size in 13.04?

This will probably work fairly easily to get access to Linux via GRUB. Once you've booted Linux via GRUB, you can optionally install an EFI filesystem driver and run the mkrlconf.sh script to create a configuration file that will enable booting Linux without using GRUB, if you care to go that route. This last isn't absolutely required, though.\n\n*Using the Windows bcdedit command to re-activate GRUB as the default boot loader. A command like bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi, typed in an Administrator Command Prompt window, should do the trick.\n\n*Using Boot Repair to fix the problem automatically. Unfortunately, Boot Repair is a bit heavy-handed in its approach (it tries every fix the developers could conceive of simultaneously), so one side effect is that there's usually an explosion of options in the GRUB menu. To avoid this, access the Advanced Options menu and uncheck the Backup and Rename EFI Files option.\n\n\nNote that the first two options require extra effort or variations if you're booting with Secure Boot enabled, so if you want to try either of those, you should disable Secure Boot (if it's enabled).\n\nA: This worked for me:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Used Super Grub Disk to load Windows (you’ll have option to choose from available OSs.)  \n\n*Turned Fast Boot off.

It seems like gnome3 ppa pulled packages from this ppa.\nSo, I ran the following command (the names of the packages are the ones that had the pitti versions installed):\nsudo aptitude install dbus=1.6.8-1ubuntu6 dbus-x11=1.6.8-1ubuntu6 gir1.2-polkit-1.0=0.105-1ubuntu1 libdbus-1-3=1.6.8-1ubuntu6 libdbus-1-3:i386=1.6.8-1ubuntu6 libdbus-1-dev=1.6.8-1ubuntu6 libpolkit-agent-1-0=0.105-1ubuntu1 libpolkit-backend-1-0=0.105-1ubuntu1 libpolkit-gobject-1-0=0.105-1ubuntu1\n\nThe above command installed the official Ubuntu repository versions of the packages.  The version numbers come from the output of apt-cache policy command above.  And now everything is working.\n", "Q: Wifi disconnects every so often with Broadcom BCM4331, even with 13.04. My wifi connection drops about every few minutes or so, and the only way to reconnect is to disable wireless, reenable it, and reconnect.

In Ubuntu, this service is provided by avahi-daemon. \nIf you don't want to advertise any services at all on the local network, you can just remove avahi-daemon. Avahi isn't necessary - clients wanting to access your services can still do so when the service IP and port number are provided manually. \nsudo apt-get remove avahi-daemon\n\nIf you want to leave Avahi advertising some services but not VLC, look in /etc/avahi/services/ for a file relating to VLC. I don't have both installed on my machine, but assuming it has a name like vlc.service, something like this might work:\nsudo mv /etc/avahi/services/vlc.service /etc/avahi/services/vlc.service.disabled\nsudo restart avahi-daemon\n\n", "Q: On Ubuntu 12.04.2, what happens if I disable dnsmasq?

Will I disable or enable DNS caching?\nAdditional notes:\nI have been told that since I am using a VPN service, it would be better for me to do the above.\n\nA: Extract from http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-disable-dnsmasq-in-ubuntu-12-04precise.html\n\nThe big advantage is that if you connect to a VPN, instead of having\n  all your DNS traffic be routed through the VPN like in the past,\n  you’ll instead only send DNS queries related to the subnet and domains\n  announced by that VPN. This is especially interesting for high latency\n  VPN links where everything would be slowed down in the past.\nAs for dealing with DNS failures, dnsmasq often sends the DNS queries\n  to more than one DNS servers (if you received multiple when\n  establishing your connection) and will detect bogus/dead ones and\n  simply ignore them until they start returning sensible information\n  again. This is to compare against the libc’s way of doing DNS\n  resolving where the state of the DNS servers can’t be saved (as it’s\n  just a library) and so every single application has to go through the\n  same, trying the first DNS, waiting for it to timeout, using the next\n  one.\n\nSo it will not disable it as such, it will be less \"safe\" and efficient under certain circumstances. Like VPN\n\nA: *\n\n*dnsmasq launched by NetworkManager doesn't cache query results by default. You can confirm this by running:\nps aux | grep dnsmasq\n\nYou should see --cache-size=0 as an argument to dnsmasq, which disables caching.\n\n*If you want to make sure DNS as well as any traffic is being routed through VPN (I believe you do based in your other question), you can use iptables to accept output traffic destined to VPN gateway and block any other destination. Thus there's no need to touch Networkmanager configuration.\n", "Q: Any alternative for Microsoft OneNote in Ubuntu? After a major migration from Windows to Ubuntu 12.0.4 Lts, I have found that I can find a substitute for pretty much everything I worked with on Windows 7. the LibreOffice package is an all-out package that can easily meet every requirements and satisfy needs, but there is one thing missing from the equation and that is an application that can open OneNote files with .one extension in  Ubuntu and Kubuntu (Debian). It is a huge hole in there for me to lament about everyday since my students do their homework in OneNote Notebooks, I have to switch to Windows every time, which is like going back to drive a rundown junk car after buying a Mercedes S500 and driving it for a while. it is so dramatically sad. what should I do? \n\nA: Take a look at this article. Although none is a 100% replacement of onenote functionality, you'll find there are some impressive apps. tl;dr Here's the  list:\n\n\n*\n\n*BasKet is a note taking software that has a number of features for taking notes and organizing data.\n\n*Zim Wiki – a Desktop Wiki, is a wonderful tool for taking notes. It does not behave anything like any traditional note taking software or Microsoft OneNote. Rather, it works like a wiki.\n\n*Tomboy is a cool note taking software which is installed by default in many Linux distributions. \n\n*CherryTree is a cross platform hierarchical note taking software.\n\n*MyNotex is an upcoming note taking software in Linux that supports a number of features that are ideal for taking notes.\n\n*KeepNote is designed to be a general note taking software that can be used in many different ways depending on the user’s needs.\n\n*TuxCards is another note taking software which is quite impressive.\n\n*Kjots is a very good note taking software. Recently, it has been rewritten grounds up using Qt 4 libraries. It is very quick to start up in GNOME even though it is essentially a KDE application.\n\n*RedNotebook is more of a personal diary and journal than a note taking software.\n\n*A simple note taking software written primarily for GNOME/Gtk-2, GJots2 is quite lean in features.\n\n*Knowit is a note taking software catering to people who want to store text snippets as notes.\n\n*NoteCase is a hierarchical notes manager (Outliner). It supports rich text editing and image insertion.\n\n*Wixi – This is a multi-platform wiki application for the desktop. It is written in python/wxpython and uses txt2tags to generate text to many other formats. The goal is to provide a simple wiki tool around the txt2tags document generator and also be multi-platform.\n\n*Memoranda – This is a free personal diary and scheduling tool. However, it can be used to keep notes. It contains a notes tab which has a rich text editor built-in. You can insert images and use different styles of text as well.\n\n\nIf none of these covers your needs, there is the last resort of installing and running onenote through wine. I have read reports of success for the 2007 version but I have no idea about how the newer versions fare in that respect.\n\nA: Here's the solution I'm using so far.  It's not perfect, but it lets me view most of the stuff in OneNote from ubuntu.\nI have a Microsoft Live account and I have all my OneNote notebooks on my skydrive.  You can login to live.com and look at your skydrive and open up your OneNote notebooks.\nTo review your student's work, you'd need to move them to your skydrive first and depending on your storage, that may be limited.\nThe one problem with using the web interface is that I'm not sure if it's possible to insert a file onto a page or take advantage of the 2013 feature that allows you to insert an Excel file and have each sheet displayed as an image which you can then click on to edit.  The images still display in the OneNote web interface, but you can't edit them.\nAs long as you aren't inserting files/objects...the web interface is OK for reviewing and adding new notes and images.\nSearch isn't as good as it only allows you to search one section at a time instead of all notebooks. \n\nA: Use evernote by installing nevernote client.  Best available.  They support everything natively except Ubuntu and that is why you use the nevernote client.\nOtherwise, the web client is so advanced, it is better than a lot of the competitors apps.\n", "Q: Cant move files to trash somehow I cannot move files to trash. The strange thing is, that it works on the desktop-folder, but in other folders it doesn't.

It appears to be a corrupt Windows (NTFS) partition, so if you can, boot into a Windows environment (this could even include WinPE*) and run chkdsk /f in a command prompt. (if on Windows Vista/7/8, it must be ran as administrator) If you cannot boot into Windows, see this website on how to repair anything from a corrupt NTFS partition to a broken master boot record from Ubuntu. (if you're looking for how to fix a corrupted NTFS partition, scroll on down to where it says Fixing A Corrupted Windows NTFS Partition)\n*: Windows Pre-Installation Environment This would be booting from a Windows Vista/7/8 install disc or WinPE created disc via alternate methods. (it will take some Googling to find these, one I recommend that's free would be BartPE) If you are on a Windows Vista/7/8 install disc, press SHIFT+F10 after it finishes booting to open a command prompt. (it will have administrator privileges)\n", "Q: How to remove single file from /usr directory? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and I want \"XnRetro.desktop\" file to be removed from directory /usr/share/applications using terminal . How to do it ?\nI am new into Linux & I know something like \"rm\" command is used, but I don't wanna risk as there are many other files too in it.\nRegards.\n\nA: I don't recommend you remove anything by hand from the /usr folder, but if you REALLY want to not listen to my recommendation you can remove it with this command:\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/XnRetro.desktop\nBut I really don't recommend that you remove things from /usr without removing whatever installed to there, because it can sometimes cause problems.\nYou might want to consider as an alternative moving the file so it has a .old extension.  The method as outlined in another answer here, by Daniel, explains how to do this by using this command:\nsudo mv /usr/share/applications/XnRetro.desktop /usr/share/applications/XnRetro.desktop.old\n\nA: A more elegant solution would be using mv.\nType  \nsudo mv /usr/share/applications/XnRetro.desktop /usr/share/applications/XnRetro.desktop.old\n\nThis way you rename the file so it won't be recognized anymore and since the ending is not .desktop it won't show.\nIf you noticed anything is messed up because of the change you can just use mv again to rename the file to its original name.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 - When maximized, Window title blocks the maximize, minimize, and close buttons You can access the menu bar when you bring your cursor up to the top (as in the first image), but when I move it over to the X button to close the program or the maximize or minimize buttons, the title blocks it (in the second image). Is there any way to stop this from happening?\n\n\n\nA: This shouldn't happen. It looks like a bug, the buttons stay visible when I'm hovering them. Do they re-appear if you hover out of the title bar and come back over the buttons?\nMaybe you should open a bug for Unity on Launchpad.\nEdit: Another possibility is that the window is not really maximised, and your title bar goes in fact behind the Unity panel, but it doesn't seem to be the fact here (you have the \"un-maximize\" icon, not the \"maximize\" one).\n", "Q: Does anyone know how I can set the safe-volume for headphone in KDE? I dont even know if this is the right term \"safe-volume\"....but I have just changed to KDE and before I used MATE.

Which was great to protect my ears from loud noise if I previously had the volume set to 100%.\nIs there a way to set this in KDE?\nUPDATE. I have found a solution. veromix widget in KDE can be set for headphones.\n\nA: Alsa is the underlying control for all of the sound on your computer.\nThe alsamixer command can adjust all of the \"gains\" on each of the sound devices. It's a command line command and it will present a visual picture.\n\n", "Q: Random volume changes after starting games I've been having this problem for a while now, and even though I found a half-patch at some point perhaps someone can tell me how to properly solve it once and for all.\nEssentially, certain games and applications (Super Meat Boy, Braid, XBMC) will make the volume go crazy, going up and down more or less at random (although usually tending on the \"more\" side). After closing the application, if I switch to a console, I'll see the cursor flashing rapidly (something like 5 times per second or so) for a while (while the volume still goes crazy), until both problems stop at the same time (the cursor goes back to normal, and the volume stabilizes).\nA patch I've been using is, essentially, running the following script before any app which I know triggers this problem:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 122 = 0x0000\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 123 = 0x0000\"\n\nThis lines, essentially, are remapping the volume up/down keys to nothing, and that stops the problem from happening, but then again, it also causes my volume keys to stop working.\nCan anyone help me understand what is going on here? The only common thread between the applications seems to be the fact that they all make intensive use of graphics. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on an HP Notebook, and even though this problem is now happening with Cinnamon, it used to happen already on Gnome 2.\n\nA: Answering my own question, hopefully it will be useful for someone else.\nMy HP notebook comes with an accelerometer, apparently to shut down the hard drives in case it falls from somewhere. This accelerometer is registered in /dev, and all this games are reading from this device as if it were a joystick. This is why it only happened when two conditions were met:\n\n\n*\n\n*I was playing a game (happened in XBMC too)\n\n*The laptop was open (I discovered this problem didn't happen if I plugged an external monitor and closed the laptop - I'm guessing the accelerometer shuts down when the laptop is closed)\n\n\nPlugging a real joystick and telling each game to use the correct file in /dev has solved the issue.\nI know this is only a partial answer, because it does not explain why I'm getting volume changes instead of random movement, but that's the best I have. It also happens in Debian distros, btw.\n", "Q: How to switch back from Chrome OS to Ubuntu 12.04 on Acer C7 chromebook? I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed on my Acer C7 chromebook.

I'm trying to track down the specification of Unity window button themes.\nBy this I mean the specification specific to Unity, (/usr/share/themes/Radiance/unity), not the gtk or metacity specifications (/usr/share/themes/Radiance/metacity-1 or /usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-x.0).\nThe only themes I've found that appear to use this specification are the Radiance and Ambiance ones (in package light-themes).\nUpon looking in /usr/share/themes/(Ambiance|Radiance)/unity, I see the images:\n\n\n*\n\n*role.png\n\n*role_focusstate_state.png\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n*\n\n*role is one of close, maximize, minimize or unmaximize;\n\n*focusstate is focused or unfocused;\n\n*state is normal, prelight or pressed.\n\n\nIs there some specification on how to create a unity window theme? Which of the above files is required at minimum? when each is used?\n(For example, is the close.png ever used if close_[focusstate]_[state].png exists for all focus states and states already? If so, when? If not, why is close.png included with Ambiance/Radiance, which appear to cover all focus states and all states already?) \n\nA: I've done a bit more digging, and I suspect that:\n\n\n*\n\n*unity uses the metacity theme (metacity-1 subfolder) for all window decorations;\n\n*unity uses the unity subfolder to draw window buttons in the top unity panel only (when a window is maximized and the titlebar has been hidden (?))\n\n\n(I don't currently have Unity available to me to test).\nThe relevant bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/740232 \nIn particular, comment 22:\n\nThis has been fixed.

Is it a USB device? or is it from the internal hard drive?\nWhen you boot up your computer, usually on the \"Very very First screen, it will have on it somewhere advising you to press a key to \"enter setup\" or \"Change boot options menu\"\nIn either screen that shows up , here is where you direct the BIOS to either boot from a Disk , a USB device of some type, or the hard drive.\nEach computer maker is different in their design of the BIOS, but basically most all computers going back about 10 years, desktop & laptop,  will have this option.\nSo, to boot from ANY USB device , you must first set the BIOS so it knows it will boot from that particular area or if you computer has a boot options menu you just press the key relating to the choice listed.\nNOTE:\nIn the \"Boot options menu\" , (this is a screen outside the confines of the BIOS), found on many by pressing F10 orF12 ,(see your manual),  you can just choose what area to boot from for that boot only.\nWhen you make a choice from the \nBoot options menu\" screen , this will boot from that choice  Once ONLY,   Then the computer will boot from its normal setting. (what ever the BIOS has been set at)  \nTHE BIOS:\n When you make changes to the BIOS & save the settings , it will reboot with the setting set permanent until you go in and change it again.\n\nA: The install option during boot has been removed and Ubuntu will boot up and present you with the option to either Try or Install from the GUI...

When I searched for a file where one could (semi)control brightness I accidentally found a nested sequence of directories like below\naneesh@nb-14:~$ cd /sys/class/graphics/fb0/device\naneesh@nb-14:/sys/class/graphics/fb0/device$ cd graphics/fb0/device\naneesh@nb-14:/sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/graphics/fb0/device$ l\ndriver@  graphics/  modalias  power/  subsystem@  uevent\naneesh@nb-14:/sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/graphics/fb0/device$ \n\n\n* What is the motive behind having such nested sequences of directories?\n\n* How was this possible? I figured out one possible answer to that. E.g.: for creating a sequence /a/b/a/b/a/b..., one can create a link to the directory /a and paste it in the folder /a/b. Is this the only way nested sequences can be formed?\nSymbolically it's not obvious: To verify this I tried giving command l (see above) and found symbols against each file/directory. I learnt from this forum itself that in the result of l, the symbol @ is for indicating drivers and / for directories. But no symbolic indication to show that a certain folder is actually a link to another one! Also, there's no manual entry about l to find which symbol (if any) indicates file link.\n\nA: The loop (nesting) you see actually serves A very important purpose. \nImagen \"Give me the other device on the same device as that device\". I know that's confusing in video card context but think of sound card. \n\"Give me the other outputs on the same card as output 5\"\nIn order to do this you need some kind of \"children on my parent\" which is exactly what you have here. \"Children of my parent\" may only have 1 entry but that is ok to.\nTo add more complexity, the /sys folder isn't even really there. It's an enumeration of kernel stuffs. So it's kind of like a \"easy to use api\" for accessing kernel data. So not only can that lead to situations like your example, but there not even really files, so it's quite alright if it does. \nTo see if something is a link you can always use ls -la to display more verbose details. But keep in mind those files are not real, and may not be symbolic links in the true sense, and there for it is totally possible to have recursion  without doing anything \"wrong\" or using links/etc. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 Ralink rt5390 won't work after upgrade, I Have an HP 2000 Notebook dualboot with Win7 and Ubuntu 13.04.

Do you have Skype? It seems that the Skype icon/openbox/tint2 combination doesn't work all of the time, try a pkill tint2&&tint2, and see if that fixes it. If it does, you may have to live with it, or get a different dock-app, the bug been open for 4 years, and doesn't look like it got fixed.\n", "Q: Can't shut down in GNOME-shell 3.8 For the past month or so I've been unable to shut down or reboot my PC from GNOME-shell.

I am the system administrator on a network using a single Ubuntu 12.04 computer as a server and several Windows (XP) clients.\nIs it possible to restrict users from accessing USB storage devices on their Windows machines from the Ubuntu server?\nNote: These machines may have other non storage devices connected via USB such as keyboards and mice which must not be affected by this.\nI am aware I can block access on a client by client basis from the Windows side by following the instructions from Microsoft here:\n\nHow can I prevent users from connecting to a USB storage device?\nBut I want to be able to enforce this from the Ubuntu side.\nIs this possible and if so how?  \n\nA: Unless there is an extra client-server system in place, I read from your question the following.\nYou have a network with several computers, used as Windows clients, and a computer used as Ubuntu server.\nThese computers have no special relationship, they just 'are' on the network. Now you want to disable the \"use USB storage devices\" feature on the windows computers\nThen no: your 'random' ubuntu computer (that currently is designated 'server') cannot force another computer to restrict USB access. That's all local. The computer itself must do this.\nNow solutions could be the windows OS setting permissions. It MUST be from the windows side. What you can do is have your windows computers 'look' for a master (domain server for instance) and that server set the policies. But the you'd still need to change the windows machines, and I know of no method to set windows policies from Ubuntu...\n", "Q: using deja dup to backup my ubuntu to a windows shared folder I have a ubuntu 12.04 running and have certain things installed like samba,nagios and likewise-open to have my ubuntu join a windows domain. this all works correctly. I am not an expert in linux although I do know some basics.\nWhat I am trying to do is use deja-dup to backup my ubuntu machine to a windows shared folder with the windows-share method?\nat the server line I filled in the ip-address of my windows server.\nat the folder I put /smb://\"mywindowsserver\"/folder\nusername is the username I created for backing up. (I have read somewhere that it usually works to have the same usernames on a Windows server and Ubuntu machine with backing up)\ndomain name my domain name.\nI am not sure I have the syntax right at the folder it is supposed to back up to\nWhen I click backup now it does connect to the windows server and it asks for a password. After I fill it in and press enter it says that it can't mount the windows share. When I go to that server with Ubuntu file explorer, it just connects and mounts the folder fine.\nHas this something to do with permissions? Or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: I had the same issue. Following rbello1824's link I was able to resolve it. I had to select the custom location option and manually enter the location as:\nsmb://WORKGROUP\\Username@server/Folder\n\nWorked perfect! Thanks rbello!\n\nA: I had a similar problem with entering the correct storage location on my Ubuntu 14.10. I had no success with Backup location set to Windows Share. After changing to Custom I tried using a URI in the form of:\nsmb://WORKGROUP\\Username@server/Folder`\n\nfrom the answer above, which didn't work either.  As I am using nemo as file manager I checked the URI to the shared folder, where I saw an URI in the form of\nsmb://domain;username@server/sharedfolder/folder\n\nThe difference is the semicolon between domain/workrgoup and username. This finally worked for me.\n\nA: I'm experiencing the same issue.  I found this somewhat old bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/deja-dup/+bug/1018488 that suggest issues with the smb path.  I've changed the URI in storage->backup location(custom location) to use the correct format.  I'm not sure if this is a fix but will test this evening when I'm able.\n\nA: I am running 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) I am able to connect to my windows share folder by using setting the Storage location as a Custom Location.  I set the URI to smb://WindowsServerName/$haredFolderName.  Once I set these two fields deja-dup worked correctly. The windows share I used was already set up on my computer.  Hope this helps, \nCheers\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04.2(Elementary OS) I found that after installing deja dup, I was unable to backup to my onsite Linux server, this server running a vanilla samba version and a very vanilla smb.config file, so I actually used some knowledge I gained from having to mount an SMB file share in the dreaded Mac Terminal(for some reason it wouldn't mount in Finder) on a job site, and so after using a modified form of the URI on the \"Custom Location\" storage selection I was able to get it to work. Here is the modified code...\nsmb://WORKGROUP;sambausername@sambahostname/SMBShare\n\nThis worked for me and now my Linux laptop can be easily backed up, this was a much more painless process than having to have a Mac Backup up to an SMB Share...\n", "Q: my keyboard doesn't respond when i try to reset a lost administrative password My keyboard stops responding when i get to \nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nWhat am i doing wrong?\n\nA: When you get to that point, it doesn't show the password for security resons.

I unmounted a disk (/dev/vdc1) on my server machine (it doesn't have a graphical environment) and then formatted it as an xfs file system. I forgot to mount it again and also didn't add the respective line to my fstab file.\nNow, after rebooting the server, I want to mount this partition, but I can't access it. I get this error:\nmount: can't find dev/vdc1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab\n\nSo how should I edit my fstab file so that the system recognizes the partition again? The partition was mounted on /Data.\n\nA: First you need to find out UUID of your disk by following  command\nsudo blkid\n\nNote your disk UUID.\nNow open fstab file with gedit\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nReplace your old disk UUID with your noted UUID.\nSave file and reboot your system. You will be able to mount disk. \n\nA: So here we create an fstab entry for the partition.\n\n*\n\n*You need to create the folder for the partition and get the device id. Open a terminal. The folder can be created via:\nsudo mkdir /media/Data\n\nIn addition, I would make the user the owner and give him the right to read/write:\nsudo chown [user]:[group] /media/Data\nsudo chmod +rw /media/Data\n\n\n\n*Now the fstab entry.\n\n*\n\n*Install libblkid1 to see device specific information:\nsudo apt-get install libblkid1\n\n\n\n*Enter sudo blkid and look for the stick. The output could be:\n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"32a4b76f-246e-486e-8495-31b8a781fb4c\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"31f39d50-16fa-4248-b396-0cba7cd6eff2\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\n\n\n*Then we create the fstab entry:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nand append the line:\nUUID=31f39d50-16fa-4248-b396-0cba7cd6eff2     /media/Data   auto    rw,user,auto    0    0\n\n(and afterwards give a empty new line to avoid warnings).\nTo mount the partition, open a terminal and run:\nmount /media/Data\n\nBecause of the entry auto it should be mounted automatically on next boot.\nBefore the next boot, don't forget to verify the entries! On any error in the fstab file, the system will not start and you will need to recover it, by reverting the changes. You can verify the entries with:\nsudo findmnt --verify\n\n\nA: While Manuel seems to have answered the asked question quite fully, the question you seem to have meant to ask was:\n\n\"After I unmounted a disk /dev/vdc1 from /Data and formatted it to XFS, I can't remount it.  How do I remount it at /Data?\"\n\nYou seem to be misunderstanding (reasonably) the error message help text that results, which is what's caused confusion about your question.\nYou unmounted the device, /dev/vdc1, from /Data, formatted the device to XFS, then tried to remount it and it's saying there's no such device.  Since you didn't give details on the exact command(s) you ran to \"format the device to XFS\", I'm going to assume what you did was:\nsudo mkfs.xfs -f /dev/vdc1\n\nIf you forgot the -f, or didn't answer yes to a prompt to overwrite the existing file system, the mkfs command failed.\nAfter doing this, you should just be able to run the command\nsudo mount -t xfs /dev/vdc1 /Data\n\nLooking at the error that was generated, it appears you entered dev/vdc1, rather than /dev/vdc1, and/or reversed the arguments to the mount command.\nIf it's still giving you an error for some reason, confirm that /dev/vdc1 actually exists.  You can check /var/log/syslog or run dmesg to see what the system did after you created the new file system to determine if it decided to change the device associated with the partition for some reason, or what explicit error occurred when you ran the mount command that failed.\n", "Q: LaTeX distribution problem pdftex.fmt I just installed the TexLive 2012 from the Ubuntu Repository.

Thus it is imperative to completely remove TexLive from a system, before installing a fresh TexLive distro. \nThe instructions for completely removing / purging texlive are given in this page. Inspite of that my fresh installation was not working.

I have a small laptop currently running XP(home/sp3) as my primary OS and I wanted to try Ibuntu, \nI downloaded and installed using the windows installer wubi.exe. it did the partiton for me and I just went along with a install guide and left the sizes and allocations as default.\nSo now when I start my laptop I have the choice of OS but ....is there a way please to run both OS's side by side or have I gone about it wrong and should I have just downloaded an image file to use in a virtual machine ?\nmany thanks in advance :)\n\nA: Yes, if you want to run them side by side (or technically, one inside of the other), you'll need to install Ubuntu in a virtual environment as a virtual machine (VM).\nThere are several virtual machine applications that you can use to install Ubuntu. In my opinion, a quick and free way is to use VirtualBox.\nThere are, however, limitations when running virtual machines, because they actually do not have access to the hardware, so don't expect to play games smoothly and all that. Nonetheless, an Ubuntu virtual machine is a great way to get acquainted with it.\nIf you're looking to remove the Ubuntu you installed, then you're in luck, because it's easy. Since you've installed Ubuntu using Wubi, you can easily uninstall it by going to your Add/Remove Programs in XP and uninstalling Ubuntu from the list, just like you would uninstall any other program.\nNote: If you decide to go with VirtualBox, don't forget to install Guest Additions in your Ubuntu virtual machine, because without it, your Ubuntu might be very slow. If you go with VMware, don't forget to install VMware tools.\n\nA: Dual booting means having the option to choose which OS you want to use at start-up.  And you can do this via Wubi though this is no-longer recommended or by  installing from boot media such as DVD or USB drive.\nYou can't really have two Operating Systems running at the same time one must be in charge.  What you can have however is a virtual machine and install a guest OS inside that.\nThe guest OS does not have full access to the hardware however: only what the virtual machine wants it to have.  Consequently the guest OS will run slower.  Depending on what you are using it for this may not matter.\nIf you want to run one OS inside the other take a look at Virtualbox It's a popular free virtual machine and you can install it from the software centre if Ubuntu is your host OS or from here if using Windows as your main host OS.\n", "Q: How to rebuild ZFS pool with new disks of different sector sizes? I have Ubuntu 12.04 with ZFS installed. There are two pools: rpool (the root filesystem) and rdata (all the data). rdata was built with 2 x 1TB WD EADS drives (with 512 byte physical sectors) in a ZFS mirror. rdata has many datasets on it in a hierarchy.\nrdata is running out of space so I have purchased 2 x Seagate 3TB drives. Unfortunately, when I tried to add one the the new drives to the mirror, so that it would resilver, zpool attach failed saying\ncannot attach /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1EE1G-part1 to /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_WDC_WD10EADS-00_WD-WCAU47275172-part1: devices have different sector alignment\n\nI now know this is because the new drives ave 4k physical sectors and the only recovery path is to rebuild the pool. I am proposing to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure there is a snapshot of all datasets on rdata.\n\n*Remove 1 element of the rdata mirror (so I have a known good backup and to free up a SATA port)\n\n*Connect one of the new drives to the machine\n\n*create a new pool called rdata1 with 4k sectors and a single physical device\n\n*use zpool recv to restore the snapshots of rdata's datasets to rdata1\n\n*\n\n*At this point, rdata1 should be identical to rdata\n\n\n*export the device on which rdata1 is located\n\n*destroy rdata\n\n*import the device that contained rdata1 as rdata\n\n*remove the old physical disk and replace it with the other new disk\n\n*attach the other new disk to the newly created rdata to re-create the mirror\n\n\nDoes this sound reasonable? I'll still have the second old disk if it goes wrong and as a final resort, I have another FreeNAS server that has a full backup of all the snapshots; just in case.\nGareth\n\nA: In the end, the matter was forced by an error on my part. The procedure I used in the end was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown system and disconnect one element of the original pool; replacing it with one on the new disks.\n\n*Power on and create a new pool with the single new disk\n\n*use rsync to move the data across rather than zpool recv\n\n*export both pools\n\n*import the new pool using the old name\n\n*power off and replace the other old drive with a new one\n\n*power on and attach the new drive to the new pool.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the system refused to forget about the old pool. I have moved this to a new question: How do I remove a pool from ZFS?\n", "Q: How to install the latest version of a package with apt-get? It's easy to install a specific version of a package with apt-get:\napt-get install <package name>=<version>\n\nFor example: \napt-get install jenkins=1.517\n\nBut is there a shortcut for installing the latest version?\nFor example, say writing a script to automate Jenkins installation. After adding http:/q/pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian to /etc/apt/sources.list, Jenkins is available from two sources. Now, I'd like to tell apt-get to install the latest version without knowing exactly what the latest version is at the time the script is executed.\nIs this possible in any simple way?\n\nA: For anyone else that lands here: ttoine's answer is correct.\nBUT if you are stuck with the apt-get -q -y --force-yes install openjdk-6-jdk=<blah> syntax (let's say via Chef), you can specify an asterisk/star to get the latest: apt-get -q -y --force-yes install openjdk-6-jdk=\\*\n\nA: Note that to get an actual latest version of a package, you may need to add a repository to apt, a repository that holds a more current (i.e., real latest) version of the package. E.g., the openvpn documentation explains:\n\"Latest OpenVPN releases are available in the OpenVPN project's apt repositories. This allow you to use more up-to-date version of OpenVPN than what is typically available in your distribution's repositories.\"\nOf course, you want to make sure you trust any repository you add. There are various ways to add a repository. I like the way they suggest in the OpenVPN docs linked above. There's also add-apt-repository.\n\nA: just type\napt-get update    \napt-get install <package-name>\n\nAnd the latest available in all your repositories will be installed.\n\nA: The selected answer works in most cases. However, you might find yourself in a situation where a more recent version is available in a backport repository which will not be installed by apt-get install <package-name> by default. For example, I recently came across this:\n$ apt-cache policy golang\ngolang:\n  Installed: 2:1.3.3-1\n  Candidate: 2:1.3.3-1\n  Version table:\n     2:1.7~5~bpo8+1 0\n        100 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-backports/main amd64 Packages\n     2:1.5.1-4~bpo8+1 0\n        100 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-backports/main amd64 Packages\n *** 2:1.3.3-1 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nSelecting a version from the backports can be done by specifying to install from backports: apt-get -t xenial-backports install golang.\nReference: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports#Installing_Backports\n\nA: This works for packages that were installed using apt-get:\napt-get update <package-name>\n\nBut if you install an app from a GitHub repository that publishes their content on a release basis, the apt-get update won't work as it is not part of the Ubuntu/Debian ecosystem.\nYou need to re-install the package.\nPlease see the instructions on the package repo, but usually if you re-install the package it will get updated.\nCheck the version before and after the re-install to make sure your package was updated correctly.\n", "Q: Installing Rails on Ubuntu 13.04 I tried installing rails according  to this guide, and when I do, I get this error:\n$ sudo gem install rails\n  WARNING:  Error fetching data: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - getaddrinfo (http://rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)\n  WARNING:  Error fetching data: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - getaddrinfo (http://rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz)\n  Building native extensions.

It shows the following error message:\nunable to access\nError mounting /dev/sda5 at /media/zerox/ZeroX: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda5\" \"/media/zerox/ZeroX\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda5': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nWhat do I do to access the partitions?\n\nA: The message is pretty clear: Windows is hibernated, and thus, still has the volume open, so you can not simultaneously open it in Linux without corrupting it.  You need to boot into Windows and shut it down rather than hibernate.  Also note that the fast restart feature in Windows 8 makes the shutdown option actually hibernate rather than shutdown, so you either need to turn it off, or use the restart option instead.\n\nA: Your disks were not properly unmounted by Windows.\nReboot and let Windows repair the disk.  Shut down Windows properly (this is important), and retry.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Wubi Booting Problems I've previously installed Windows 7 and Windows 8 and both of them in dual boot with Windows 8 bootloader. Then, I installed Ubuntu 13.04 by using Wubi in Windows 8 in a separate partition(E). So, the Windows 8 bootloader have Ubuntu listed automatically. Everything worked fine. I've deleted Windows 8 installation and switched my bootloader to Windows 7 bootmanager. But, I can't get Ubuntu 13.04 to boot. Now, it is installed in drive E and I cannot able to boot it. I've used EasyBCD and also command prompt commands to change the drive letters and paths. But, after doing this error is showing up as:\nGRLDR is missing. Press CTRL + ALT + DELETE to restart\n\nAny ideas? How can I install wubi bootloader?\n\nA: You need a wubildr file to be in the root of a (any) partition. You can find a copy of this in the E:\\ubuntu\\winboot directory. So copy E:\\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr to C:\\wubildr (this is the place the installer puts it).\nFor more info refer to ubuntu-with-wubi.blogspot.ca/wubildr-wubildrmbr-and-grldr\n", "Q: Getting iMac mid 2011 to dual-boot ubuntu from USB drive I have been trying to get my iMac mid 2011 to dual boot Ubuntu with Lion or Mountain Lion. First I tried with an ubuntu DVD with no success then a formatted USB drive using the instructions here:\nUsing the USB and these instructions have worked a treat for me on both a MacBook Pro 2012 and a Mac Mini mid 2011 and I have dual boot working great on both. All I need to do is press Alt on startup to choose what OS to boot. I did not need to use reFit or reFind (as they did not work for me). Impossible to boot Ubuntu on a USB stick (OS X Montain Lion)\nOn the iMac I have tried in turn a) reFind, b) pressing Alt on boot, c) press C on boot up and none has been able to identify the USB (or CD) boot disk to boot from it. \nHas anyone tried this on an iMac and can they help me out. Many thanks in advance \n\nA: I have the same iMac: mid-2011 or 12,1. I've come to the conclusion this model can't boot other OSes from USB. As you say, this capability varies from model to model. \nI just boot from a CD instead. I recently did this to flash new firmware to my SSD. \n", "Q: How do I remove infected files in a Ubuntu server samba share? I am running a Ubuntu Server with Windows XP Clients. I have shared files with XP clients via samba share. The problem is there is a huge number of viruses in the share. Is there any way to remove those virus from Ubuntu itself? Windows clients only have read permission.\n\nA: Install one of the many available anti-virus tools for Linux: ClamAV, Avast, BitDefender, for example will do just fine and scan the shared files in the Samba shares.\nClamAV for instance has a CLI and a GUI interface, so you can scan a mount point with it via ssh or by getting direct access to the server, no need for an actual graphical interface.\nYou would then use the command sudo clamscan -r -l /tmp/scan.log /shares to scan recursively the folder /shares and save a log of that scan to /tmp/scan.log.\nDon't forget to make a backup of those files before actually running the scanner, some customers won't understand that some files are so infected that there is no recovery for them and the solution will be to just delete them, so before running a scan make sure that in the eventuality of that happening you can serve them in another media so they can take care of it themselves.\n", "Q: Painlessly updating from Ubuntu 10.04 to 11.04 or 11.x Is there a way to update from 10.04 to 11.04? I see an option to update to 12.04 LTS but I would rather keep it 11.04 because the new UI is terrible :)\nIt's because of nvidia drivers and failing to set them up on a 2.6.32-lts when the drivers need 2.6.34-ARCH or something such....\nIf there is no way to update to 11.04, is there a way to use 12.04 so that it looks like the good ol' 11.04? :)\n\nA: Thanks to Oli for pointing out the updating issue, but as for Gnome I think I'll give this (http://pleasanthacking.com/2012/01/02/making-ubuntu-11-10-and-12-04-behave-like-10-04/) a shot.\n#gnome\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel gnome-session-fallback gnome-tweak-tool\n\n#ported indicator\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jconti/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-applet indicator-applet-complete indicator-applet-session indicator-applet-appmenu\n\n#compiz\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-extra\n\n#radiance 10.04\nwget http://light-themes-lucid.googlecode.com/files/Radiance-10.04a-gtk3-gtk2.tgz\nsudo tar -xzf Radiance-10.04a-gtk3-gtk2.tgz -C /usr/share/themes\n\nHopefully, it'll do the trick.\n\nA: 10.04 and 12.04 are both LTS releases, which is why you can upgrade directly to 12.04. 11.04 and 11.10 are both end of life now, meaning they're unavailable for standard download (you could probably hack around this but it's not a good idea).\nI would personally recommend upgrading to 12.04 and fixing what you don't like.\nIf you're unhappy with Unity, Compiz or whatever in the latest release, you can try other things. KDE (kubuntu-desktop package) provided me with a happy place to call Home but other people swear by XFCE and LDXE, even Enlightenment. Everybody likes something different...\nThe point I'm trying to make is you're not stuck with what you're given. And testing another desktop is relatively simple and non-destructive.\n", "Q: Resize partitions I have a PC with Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 in dual boot. The Ubuntu partition has 25GB of disk space and I'm running out of space so I want to make this partition bigger. The situation is the following:\nDispositivo Boot    Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048     3071999     1534976   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda2   *     3072000   254730239   125829120    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       254730240   438394879    91832320    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4       438396926   488396799    24999937    5  Esteso\n/dev/sda5       438396928   488396799    24999936   83  Linux\n\nGparted screenshot\nThe sda2 partition is the Windows 7 one, in sda3 I have only some data (this is the partition that I want to resize to gain space for the Ubuntu one) and then in sda4-5 there is Ubuntu.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't understand what is the sda4 partition that seems to contain the Ubuntu one (sda5)\n\n*Is safe to resize partitions sda3 and sda5 using gparted from a LiveCD? I mean safe both for Windows (data in sda3 and system in sda2) and for Ubuntu (sda5). It is better if I move my data from partition sda3 to an external memory before doing the resize?\n\n\nA: /dev/sda4 is what's known as a extended partition; the partition table only has room for 4 primary partitions. To get more than 4 partitions out of a disk you need to create one of the partitions as a extended partition...this is then subdivided into further partitions as you create them.\nAs for resizing the Windows partition I've successfully used gparted to do it. However you need to make sure you run a \"Disk Defragmention\" tool across your Windows partition before doing it. The GParted FAQ does come with the following warning:\n\nWhen resizing boot NTFS partitions, it is advisable to perform this as\n  a single operation only. After resizing, boot into Windows twice to\n  allow Windows to perform its checking operations.\n\nMake sure you backup any data you want to keep in both Windows and Ubuntu when resizing the partitions; it should be a straight forward process but it can go wrong and you don't want to loose data!\n", "Q: Changing hostname causes unity to doesn't startup I changed my hostname from jv01-carlos.becker to jv01-carlosbecker in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts.\nAfter that, unity just never loads. I could open a browser and everything creating a folder in desktop and opening it, then poiting to /usr/share/applications.\nHow can I fix that? I couldn't find any relevant logs in /var/log/syslog.\nThanks in advance\n\nBTW: I switched back to my old hostname, and the issue persisted.\n\nEDIT: ~/.xsession-errors\nEDIT2: Just remembered that I also upgrade the kernel to 3.8.0-23\n\nA: Fix it with, after a lot of digging and other things that I'm not sure if affected anything:\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nunity-tweak-tool --reset-unity\n\nHave no idea about what happened.\n", "Q: How can I chmod 777 all subfolders of /var/www? I’m running a webserver and FTP server, wherein /var/www is bound to /home/user/www.\nI set both directories to chmod 777 (which is fine since it’s for testing only).\nI can upload files into /home/user/www, but whenever I create a new directory, I always have to run chmod 777 on that folder.\nOtherwise, when I try to browse it, I get the error message\n\nYou don't have permission to access /test/ on this server.\n\nIs there a way I could make all sub-folders inside /var/www be accessible by anyone? Or could their permissions be automatically set to 777? It’s annoying that I have to type chmod 777 every time.\n\nA: Public service announcement:\n\nDon't ever use chmod 777 to fix problems\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a security risk if you run any services available to the public,\nespecially web applications (eg PHP).\nThe OS's security model assumes that many services (such as your\nweb server) run with reduced privileges, preventing them being able to modify files.  Setting 777 on files breaks that secure design.\nA remote user could write to or upload files and then trick the server (or some other process on your system) into reading or executing them.  Scripts or software may have flaws that allow this.  It's very difficult to be sure you have locked down every single way this could happen if there are world-writable directories.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Used in certain system directories (/usr, /etc, /var, and so on), it can break your system in surprising ways.\nSome essential system files need special permissions such as setuid/setgid permissions in order to run.  For example, sudo.  Avoid changing any file permissions on directories and files set up by the system itself.\n\n\n*There's no way to undo it and get back all the old permissions.\nThat is, if you had files and folders with various different permissions before, there's no way to go back to those specific permissions - only to change them all to the same thing, which may lose any specific permission settings that were needed on specific files.\n\n\n*There is always a more appropriate way of achieving what it is you want to achieve.\nThe default setup Ubuntu (and other OSes) use of running the web server as an unprivileged user and having the website files world-readable is a reasonable secure choice and in the interests of consistency, shouldn't be varied unless necessary.  So, to ensure that the unprivileged server process can read your website files they will need to be world-readable.\nGiving world-writable permission is way more than you need to do.\nWhen tracking down why the web server process can't read your files, remember that not only do the files themselves need to be world-readable (eg, 644)  their parent directories should be world-readable and traversable (eg, 755).  Set your home directory to something like 755, or if you don't want your home directory world-readable, move your www dir outside your home into somewhere like /var/www or /srv).\nNote about making files writable:\nOccasionally, you need your web server to be able to write to certain files.  To achieve this, make sure you only allow write permission on the specific files you want to give that permission for, and it's still better to use group ownership and group-write bit to give that permission that make them world-writable.\n\nA: cd /var/www\nfind -type d ! -perm 777 -exec chmod 777 {} \\;\n\nfor the ftp creating all files with different permissions, you might want to look for the umask of ftpd, how that daemon is started\nTake a look to this site\nhttps://linuxaria.com/article/linux-shell-understanding-umask-with-examples \n\nA: If you would like to copy permissions and or ownership from another file that you're satisfied with, you can do so using sudo chmod --reference=path/to/file/to/reference path/to/file/you/want/to/change/permission/to\nAnd you can do the same thing for file ownership as well.\n\nA: This is bad practice, but hopefully you are just using this for development, or you have another good reason. You can specify the permissions when you create a directory using the -m option:\nmkdir -m 777 dirname\n\nOr you can set the permissions recursively.\nsudo chmod -R 777 /var/www\n\nBefore using either of these, really consider if you want your filesystem to be so accessible.\n\nEdit:\nAs mentioned by Rinzwind here is a better way of accomplishing what you want. \nCheck what group owns your /var/www directory and add your user to that group.\nsudo adduser yourusername group\n\nThe group is probably www-data.\nThen you will be OK with setting your permissions to 775. \n\nA: Files and directories in Unix may have three types of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). Each permission may be on or off for each of three categories of users: the file or directory owner; other people in the same group as the owner; and all others.\n    To change the mode of a file, use the chmod command. The general form is\n        chmod X@Y file1 file2 ...\nchmod a-w file (removes all writing permissions)\nchmod o+x file (sets execute permissions for other (public permissions))\nchmod u=rx file        (Give the owner rx permissions, not w)\nchmod go-rwx file      (Deny rwx permission for group, others)\nchmod g+w file         (Give write permission to the group)\nchmod a+x file1 file2  (Give execute permission to everybody)\nchmod g+rx,o+x file    (OK to combine like this with a comma)\n\nu = user that owns the file\ng = group that owns the file\no = other (everyone else)\na = all (everybody)\n\nr = read aces to the file\nw = write access\nx = execute (run) access \n\n\nA: This does not work to me.\nsudo chmod -f 777 /path/to/your/file/or/directory\n\nI have to use -f also.\nsudo chmod -R -f 777 /path/to/your/file/or/directory\n\n", "Q: VMWare won't start any VM's I recently took the step, formatting my main drive and installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in place of Windows 7.

I'd like to view information about page tables from the command line. \nAs background, I've been learning about page tables and how they are critical to managing processes, where each process is assigned its own address space so that process A cannot write to process B's memory space. \nEssentially, the page table maps between virtual addresses and physical addresses. \nI would like to actually view from the command line this mapping to see how it works.  Any pointers in the right direction are appreciated.  \n\nA: I think the closest you are going to get is /proc/PID/maps, which the pmap utility reads and reformats so it is a bit easier to read.

I have the rest of the program running and it works great on the localhost and on a local network, but I want to be able to, like I said, let my friends connect. \nMy guess is that I would have to use my global IP address, and I can get that via PySTUN, but whenever I try to bind the socket/server thing to my global IP address it barfs back this error:\n\nsocket.error: [Errno 99] Cannot assign requested address`\n\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: You need to configure your network correctly, basically. And you need to bind on the IP address of the external network interface (eth0 for example), not the local address on the local interface (lo). If you have a router, then your public address (the one assigned to your router) is not the address of your computer. You will have to bind locally, and tell the router to open up the port you wish to use, and forward all traffic through it, to your computer. You may be able to do that with UPnP/STUN, depending on your router, or you may need to manually configure it.\n", "Q: Can I install a new version of Ubuntu over old Ubuntu that I forgot the password to I have forgotten my password for an older version of Ubuntu and don't have anything important on it and just want to install the new version, do I need to know the password in order to do this? \n\nA: No, you don't.

Ubuntu does not load.\nIf I launch from recovery mode the computer tells me that the drivers will not load until I reboot, and I get to log in through what appears to be a full screen terminal. I can ctrl-alt-f1 and ctrl-alt-f2 through and create different log ins. \nI was wondering if someone could guide me through the process of uninstalling and installing a working driver from here, that is only IF that is the problem and I missed something completely.\nI am running 12.04 on a acer aspire 6935 laptop, if more information is needed please ask away.\nThank you!\n\nA: *\n\n*Login in one of those terminals\n\n*Issue dpkg --get-selections | grep nvidia: you should get there the name of the package providing nVidia driver.

I found out that I have to type sudo alsa force-reload in order to get the sound working again.\nHow can I fix this issue, so that Ubuntu plays sound after a startup?\n\nA: I recently updated Ubuntu and I had the same problem. I read many post on the subject, but I couldn't find a solution.\nFinally I saw that when I restarted alsa, it killed timidity. So I disabled the service using the following command and bingo!\nsystemctl disable timidity\n\n\nA: The most complete answer I've found around is this one\nhttp://itsfoss.com/fix-sound-ubuntu-1304-quick-tip/\nI've a motherboard ASUS P8H77-M PRO and the third hint worked for me.\n", "Q: What is Ubuntu's top bar called? Mac osx and Ubuntu have the same type of bar at the top of the screen. What I mean is that it is dynamic, when you launch an application, you can reach its setting by using that top bar, file view and so on is not implemented in the application itself, but it is implemented to that bar. \nWhat is this user interface called?\n\nA: The top bar in Ubuntu (Unity) is called the panel. Sometimes the menus are called the global menu bar, but not often.\nAs an aside, menus actually are implemented in applications. They just appear in the panel.\n\nA: The menu you are talking about is a property of the unity desktop. It is known as the 'Unity Global Menu'. \nEach application implements it own the main menu, but the desktop environment places them where it sees fit.  The Unity desktop environment, developed by Canonical as a replacement of Gnome, chooses to place these menus in the top panel.\nIf you run the same applications in a xfce environment (for example), then the menu will appear in the window.\nThis applies to all applications that define their menu using the gtk library. For those that don't, including Firefox and LibreOffice, special patches have been made to make the menus work in the global menu.  Otherwise applications that don't will have their menu in the window.\nAnother exception, that I know of, are Java applications. These always have their menu's in the java window. I think this is because Java bypasses the desktop environment to create java app windows, not defining their menus in gtk.\n\nA: Find out What's the right terminology for Unity's UI elements?\nComplementary to the Global Menu there is the HUD. How do I use the HUD?.\n\nA: The global menu as described here is an exclusive feature of Unity. The Unity HUD benefits of it: it finds almost every menu entry of all running applications.\n", "Q: Where is \"startup applications\" user config file for disabled and enabled applications? It is the gnome-session-properties command.\nI know already the apps are at ~/.config/autostart.\nI know there are files at /etc but those are root.\nI found nothing at gconf-editor.\nI need to know where gnome-session-properties stores what apps are disabled and enabled to auto startup, so I can backup that file.\n\nA: If you edit the files inside ~/.config/autostart/ they are written in this way:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Dropbox\nGenericName=File Synchronizer\nComment=Sync your files across computers and to the web\nExec=dropbox start -i\nHidden=false\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=dropbox\nCategories=Network;FileTransfer;\nStartupNotify=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\n\nThe last line is the one that specifies if the app is enabled or not (check it by yourself with the gnome-session-properties enabling and disabling an app and noticing the change of that option in the file).\nThen, you only have to copy all the files inside the folder to make a backup of that configuration.\n\nA: It does not store the data in a single file. The autostart files are copied into ~/.config/autostart when you configure them, and they are modified in there. So you should simply back up that directory if you wish to save that configuration.\n", "Q: Installation of Ubuntu server 13.04 I have installed ubuntu server 13.04\nAfter installation when I enter the username and the password, nothing happens, still the black screen shows.What should I do?\n\nA: Ubuntu Server doesn't come with a graphical environment.

Tried \"C\", then \"option\" at restart and DVD is ejected. I want to Run, to take a look, before I install.\n\nA: Install refit boot manager, then it will be easier to install as when the Mac boots it will then wait and allow you to select the DVD to install from. If it doesn't run then you know that the DVD you created is not made correctly.\nhttp://refit.sourceforge.net/#download\nAlthough this link says its out of date, its still valid and the alternative refind is harder to install. So if you are experienced you could install that instead. But if you are a beginner then I recommend you install refit instead.\nPS: When you install refit, reboot the Mac at least twice as it takes two boots to install correctly\n", "Q: Disable touchpad switch application? When i'm scrolling sometimes ubuntu will think i'm trying to switch applications. \nIs there a three finger application switching feature in ubuntu 13.04 that i don't know about? \nIt sometimes also switches applications when my palms are touching. I tried disable while typing and it's not optimal or user friendly. It's rather annoying to me.\n\nA: Yes. This is three finger tap followed by hold to switch between app windows. The explanation here. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch\n\nA: In my case, running following command solved the problem.\nsynclient ClickFinger3=2\n\n\nA: The Window List will switch applications if you scroll while the cursor is over it.\n\nA: This was messing with my head, too. I couldn't figure out how to reproduce it until I read the Multitouch wiki posted by bagustris in his comment above.\nRunning\n\nsynclient ClickFinger3=2\n\nimmediately fixed the problem.

Has anyone managed to install OS X Guest in VirtualBox under Ubuntu? I've wasted 3 days trying to accomplish this by following various tutorials around the Web, but none seem to work for me.\nCan anyone share some experience, or an updated tutorial link for this? For the record, I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 on Acer AS5830TG.\n\nA: I will warn you that I do not condone this, so please don't try it. However, for educational purposes, it is possible to install OSX in VirtualBox... you need a Hackintosh install disc to do this though. For information on this, have a look here: Lifehacker \"How to Run Mac OS X Inside Windows Using VirtualBox\". Ignore the fact that they are using VirtualBox in Windows, because the same process will work in Ubuntu too.\n\nA: http://www.sysprobs.com/install-mac-snow-leopard-1063-oracle-virtualbox-32-apple-intel-pc\nShould work on ubuntu as well, give it a try\n\nA: I have done the same thing  and found out that OSX is very hardware specific. So to get the OSX to work you need to adjust the OSX to understand the hosts hardware emulation. You will be able to get it up and running so that the ethernet works and the screen and the rest is very dodgy.\nThe other problem as that the OSX will not be update-able. As soon as you update the OSX the install will break. The process is a cat and mouse chase of ensuring your updates do not kill the emulators limited hardware.\nYou'd think that Apples decision to go down the Intel route would make it easier but it doesn't. In the end the emulation will be slow and any advantage that OSX brings will be lost.\nThere are premade versions that are sold by third party vendors to run on regular hardware but they too will suffer from the issues I have mentioned.\n", "Q: green header file In terminal, when I type ls, I see some header files (like foo.h) in green. As far as I know, green corresponds to executable files. So why some of the those header files are in green?\n\nA: It is green because its permissions say it is executable.  You can see the permissions with ls -l.  Because FAT/NTFS do not store permissions all files on volumes using these Windows formats will show as executable.  If the file is not on a Windows volume, then you can change the permissions with the chmod command.  chmod a-x foo.h will remove all 3 execute bits ( owner, group, other ) from the file and stop it showing as green.\n\nA: That is a function of the terminal program you use. For example in my terminal, it does not display in green. But if I mark a file like test.h to executable, it will. Different terminal programs display that information based on what that author decided.\n", "Q: Why is \"rm\" so much slower than deleting files via the File Manager? I witnessed that deleting directories (with the size of a couple of gigabytes) which contain many files is very slow when using rm. It takes up to several minutes!\nWhen deleting the same folder via the File Manager, the job is done within a second. (It takes another second to empty the trash afterwards.)\nWhat is the reason for this?\n\nA: The rm command actually removes the files, File Manager only moves the files to the trash. It is only when you empty the trash that you see the actual time that rm took to delete the files. So put simply, moving files is quicker than deleting. File Manager moves files while rm removes them.\n", "Q: How to find out how many hours a drive has been used? How can I check how many hours a drive has been used for? I looked in Drive Utility but I didn't see it in the smart data.

I have tried but just removing Thunar and instaling PCManFM. And PCManFM doesn't succeed Thunar features like integrated with Dropbox, starting at startup, my filesystem not appearing on places, etc.\nThank you\n\nA: Developer PCMan is a medical student and hence a busy man. This and other reasons resulted in PCManFM being poorly maintained.\nDeveloper ignorantguru took up the lead and developed SpaceFM, a worthy and more powerful successor to PCManFM. SpaceFM features many easily installable user-contributed plugins —some of yours truly— that will cater for many of your needs.\nFollow the instructions for installing SpaceFM on Ubuntu (and Debian).\nAfter installation, run exo-preferred-applications and choose spacefm as the default file manager:\n\nYou also will have to change a few MIME defaults:\nxdg-mime default spacefm.desktop inode/directory application\n\nThe file ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list should also be edited.\nLook for the line containing inode/directory=thunar.desktop;\nand change it to read inode/directory=spacefm.desktop;\nIt is possible that you also will need to perform a similar edit of /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache under administrative rights.\nFinally, mimeopen -a filename might be helpful in debugging MIME type settings.\nIf you are using XFCE like I do, there remains one caveat. Links on the desktop will continue to open with Thunar. (Thunar cannot be uninstalled because of other dependant packages.) It seems that this behaviour for opening desktop links is hard-wired in XFCE 4.8.\n", "Q: Bumblebee indicator icon on unity bar does not show up Ubuntu 13.04 I installed and configured bumblebee and the bumblebee indicator once before on Ubuntu 13.04.

You might think it would make for an easier-to-manage system if no package depended on any others, but you’d face a few problems, not the least of which would be dramatically increased disk usage.\nPackages on your Linux system depend on other packages. Just about every package with an application, for example, depends on the system C libraries, since these libraries provide common facilities that just about every program uses. Network applications typically depend on low-level networking libraries. These dependencies really work in your favor, since a security bug fix in the network libraries can update all applications that make use of the updated libraries.\nFurthermore, sharing software means that each package has less code to maintain and thus improved quality. Code sharing has been in the computer lexicon since the 1960s.\nAlthough quite a few packages depend on system-level libraries, some packages depend on applications defined in other packages. The Emacs text editor package, for example, depends on the Perl scripting language, specifically, the perl command. Database client programs usually depend on the database server applications.\nAn application may depend on a capability provided by another package. It may also depend on the capability that a specific version of another package provides. \nMost package dependencies assume some level of compatibility and require a version at or above a given version number.\nSource:FP\n", "Q: After changing the root password, why does my user sudo login is failing? change the root password.\ntry to execute the command with sudo, it fails to execute with new root password.\nIs there any command we need to run, after changing the root password, in order to sudo to work.\n\nA: The password that you enter when doing the sudo command is not the root password, it's the password of the user executing the sudo command. So, if you're logged in as a user uday, and you do sudo <command>, you'll be asked to enter the password of the account uday, not the root password. Take a look at this:\nuday@ubuntu:~$ sudo mkdir /media/test\n[sudo] password for uday: \n\nNotice that it says password for uday.\nSo if your intention was to change the password that you enter when you use sudo, then change the password of your account, not the root password.\nSince you've set a root password, the root account has now been unlocked and enabled to login. It is usually advisable against that. So, unless you really need the root account, you can delete its password and lock it and by issuing the following command:\nsudo passwd -dl root\n\nIf you want to read more information about root and sudo, visit this page.\n", "Q: How do I remove XP without disturbing Lubuntu? I have a dual booted Windows XP and Lubuntu.\nI have downloaded Lubuntu through WUBI. \nIn order to speed the computer up, I have decided to remove XP. \nThe thing is, I don't want to disturb Lubuntu 12.04.

Since Lubuntu was installed using WUBI, its like any other windows application, once you remove windows, everything else will be removed.  Now what I would suggest is that you backup everything that you want, and as stated in the question prior to modification, that you start fresh, and the way to do it is shown below.\nMake sure that you get a backup of all the things that you need prior to doing a fresh install.\nWhen you start the Ubuntu installation, and get to the installation type screen, you would choose something else, and delete the partitions that you have, and that is done by clicking on the - sign, and repeat for all partitions that you have.  Then create new ones by clicking on the + sign.\nThe images below show you how to get that accomplished.

I tried installing samba from Ubuntu Software Centre and from command line after installing .\nWhen I tried opening it is now showing in the application launcher or now working through command line.\n\n\nAny help \n\nA: I had the same problem. Here is the solution that worked for me.\nNOTE: If you have tried the installation and it doesn't uninstall Samba, Samba-common, system-config-samba first. to do it just replace \"install\" with \"remove\" in steps 3 & 4 \nOpen Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gksu:\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\n\n*In the terminal, run\ngksu-properties\n\nIn the dialogue that follows set authentication mode to \"sudo\" and grab mode to \"enable\".\n\n*Install Samba:\nsudo apt-get install samba samba-common\n\n\n*Install Samba Config:\nsudo apt-get install samba system-config-samba cifs-utils\n\nThe Samba icon showed up on the launch bar and everything worked fine.\nI take no credit for this solution this answer is form \"user168736\" answer here\n\nA: As Bart.a points out, samba doesn't work that way. The package called samba|samba4 just provide the modules and tools to allow applications connect trough the CIFS protocol to NetBIOS implementations. But, lets quote the Wikipedia article:\n\nSamba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol, originally developed by Andrew Tridgell. As of version 3, Samba provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Windows Server domain, either as a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or as a domain member. It can also be part of an Active Directory domain.\n\nMeaning, samba isn't an application with a GUI, but a module/service to *nix systems.\nThe samba client is mostly manageable with the defaults file browsers (Nautilus, Konqueror, etc...), with little or none configuration. To check all the SMB/CIFS resources available in your network, just typing network:// normally should show the results. For sharing files/devices/resources you need the samba-server, which is too configurable using the tools provided by Gnome, KDE, Unity without problems.\nThere are plenty of tools that allows you to browse your resources, graphically control your samba client/server here, some of them already mentioned.\n\nA: I think you did not install all the packages you need. I think you can use the command-line version, but you're looking for the GUI one, right? Please try the following. Found that here\nInstall samba:\nsudo apt-get  install  samba samba-common\nInstall dependencies for the tools:\nsudo apt-get install python-glade2\nInstall the GUI samba tools:\nsudo apt-get install system-config-samba\nAdd a samba user:\nadduser yourname\nSpecify a user password:\npasswd yourname\nNow you can look up the samba tool in unity and start configuring your shares.\nIn the link you can also find a description on how to make shares.\nGood luck.

It is specifically designed for producing documents, and can combine text, images, and PDFs into a 'master' document (without any degradation of quality). It is a full suite of libraries and  an extensible markup language, basically - it's been around since forever and highly used in the scientific community, still. \nTechnically, it's a typesetting language. \n\nA: Try LaTeX with pdflatex.\nI had never used it before but it took me about 10 minutes to start making .PDFs with it and about 40 minutes to get them customized exactly as I wanted. I included the best formatting guides I found, at the end.\nsudo apt-get install pdflatex && sudo apt-get install texlive\nBasically you create one .tex file - for example hello.tex - with the LaTeX language, then run pdflatex hello.tex on that file and it will generate the PDF. The basics of the language can be found here:\nhttp://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/\n\nHere is a barebones example .tex file:\n \\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{article}\n\n \\begin{document}\n\n {\\footnotesize\n YOUR TEXT HERE\n\n YOUR TEXT HERE\n }\n\n \\end{document}\n\n\nOptional extra formatting:\nTo add images: https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Inserting_Images\nFor different font sizes: https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Font_sizes,_families,_and_styles\nFor different fonts: https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Font_typefaces\nTo change page size and margins when using pdflatex: \n\\usepackage[pass,paperwidth=148mm,paperheight=210mm,margin=5mm]{geometry}\n\nA: Adding on the community answer above, you can do\nconvert 'ls *.jpg -tr'.

Unfortunately sort -n didn't sort my files correctly so I tried -V option and it did the trick. Also make sure the name of your files and directories are in natural sort order in advance. For example dir1, dir2, dir3 not dir1, dir_2, dir3.\n\nA: I use PDF-Shuffler for this kind of use, it works great.\nsudo apt-get install pdfshuffler\n\nIt is a graphical tool.

Images to PDF\nA tool I wrote called pdf2searchablepdf can combine many images into a single PDF. It is particularly good if you want the final PDF to have searchable text in it, as my tool performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the images using a program called tesseract in order to bundle them into a single PDF.\nInstallation instructions are here: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/PDF2SearchablePDF#install\nSince pdf2searchablepdf is a wrapper around tesseract, it accepts any image format supported by tesseract, which includes bmp, pnm, png, jfif, jpeg/jpg, and tiff. Gif is not supported. See https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Tesseract-ocr:\n\nAny image readable by Leptonica is supported in Tesseract including BMP, PNM, PNG, JFIF, JPEG, and TIFF. GIF is not supported http://www.leptonica.com/library-overview.html.\n\nTo convert all images into a PDF, they need to be all in the same folder and with nothing else in that folder. So, assuming you have img1.jpg, img2.jpg, and image3.jpg, you could do this:\n# Create an `images` dir and move all images into it\nmkdir -p images\nmv *.jpg images  # use `cp` instead of `mv` to copy instead of move the images\n\n# Now combine all of these images into 1 pdf\npdf2searchablepdf images\n\nThat's it! You'll now have a searchable PDF file called images_searchable.pdf in the directory you were in when you ran the pdf2searchablepdf command.\nNote: to go the opposite direction and convert a PDF file into a bunch of image files, I like to use pdftoppm as I explain here.\nTo convert a non-searchable pdf named input.pdf into a searchable pdf named input_searchable.pdf, do:\npdf2searchablepdf input.pdf\n\nSee pdf2searchablepdf -h for the full help menu, including options and other examples.\n2.

Try to do the same in a Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS Live USB. But I don't recommend you to use a MBR repair tool for Windows in Wine in a Live USB (personally). There will be a solution for your problem with GNU/Linux tools.\nI recommend you Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS because is the second version of Ubuntu 12.04, which is more tested and more stable than 13.04. And I don't recommend you to use the program EasyBCD in Wine over a Live USB because Wine is not suposed to manage the ext4 format as a NTFS, then, what I think is going to happen is to \"repair\" a simulated C:/ disk drive inside .wine folder.
